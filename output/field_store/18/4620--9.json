[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21254"],[0,"In Africa: Hunting Adventures in the Big Game Country (#12)"],[1," diversion I don't know what it is. I've looped the loop and there is no  comparison. It is more like being ambushed by Filipino insurgents--that  is, it's the same kind of excitement, with more danger.    One day it was necessary to shoot a big bull rhino. He staggered and  fell, but at once got up and trotted over a hill. Having wounded him, it  was then necessary for me to follow him, which I did for three blazing  hours. From nine o'clock till twelve I followed, with the sun beating  down on the dry, grass-covered hills as though it meant to burn up  everything beneath it. If any one had asked me, \"Is it hot enough for  you?\" I should have answered \"Yes\" without a moment's hesitation. The  horizon shimmered in waves of heat. From the top of one hill I could see  my rhino half a mile away on the slope of another. When I reached the  slope he was a mile farther on. I began to think he was a mirage. For a  wounded animal, with two five-hundred-grain shells in his shoulder, he  was the most astonishing example of vitality I have ever seen. He would  have been safe against a Gatling gun. There were more low trees a mile  farther on, and I plodded doggedly on in the hope of getting a little  relief from the sun. As I drew near I noticed a rhino standing under the  trees, but he was not the wounded one. I decided that the shade was  insufficient for both of us and moved swiftly on. Across the valley on  the slope of another blistered hill stood the one I was looking for. He  didn't seem to be in the chastened mood of one who is about to die. He  seemed vexed about something, probably the two cordite shells he was  carrying. I at last came up within a hundred yards of him. He had got my  wind and was facing me with tail nervously erect. The tail of a rhino is  an infallible barometer of his state of mind. With his short sight, I  knew that he could not see me at that distance, but I knew that he had  detected the direction in which the danger lay. By slowly moving ahead,  the distance was cut to about seventy yards, which was not too far away  in an open country with a wounded rhino in the foreground. I resolved to  shoot before he charged or before he ran away, and so I prepared to end  the long chase with an unerring shot.    Suddenly a sound struck my ear that acted upon me like an electric  shock:    \"_Simba!_\"    It was the one word that I had been hoping to hear ever since leaving  Nairobi, for the word means \"lion.\" My Somali gunbearer was eagerly  pointing toward a lone tree that stood a hundred yards off to the left.  A huge, hulking animal was slowly moving away from it. It was my first  glimpse of a wild lion. He was half concealed in the tall, dry grass and  in a few seconds had entirely disappeared from view. We rushed after  him. The rhino was completely forgotten and was left to charge or run  away as he saw fit. When we reached the spot where the lion was last  seen there was no trace of him. He apparently was not \"as brave as a  lion.\" We followed the course that he presumably took and presently  reached the crest of a ridge. Then the second gunbearer, a keen-eyed  Kikuyu, discovered the lion three hundred yards off to the right. After  reaching the top of the hill the animal had swung directly off at right  angles with the idea of reaching cover in a dry creek bed some distance  away. I started to shoot at three hundred yards, but before I could take  a careful aim the lion had disappeared in the grass. For an hour we  thrashed the high reeds in the dry creek bed with never a sign of the  king of beasts. He had apparently abdicated. He had vanished so  completely that I thought he had escaped toward some low hills a mile  farther on. The disappointment of seeing a lion and not getting it, or  at least shooting at it, was keen to a degree that actually hurt.    [Drawing: _Game Was Plenty for a Minute or Two_]    There was nothing left but to resume our chase after the wounded rhino.  It was like going back to work after a pleasant two weeks' vacation. We  presently found him on a far distant hill, and after an hour's tramp in  the sun we came up to him in the middle of the rolling prairie. There  was not a tree for a mile, nor a single avenue of escape in case he  charged. Horticulture had never interested me especially, but just at  this moment I think a tree, even a thorn tree, would have been a  pleasant subject for intimate study. However, to make a long story  longer, I shot him at a hundred yards and felt certain that both shells  struck. Yet he wheeled around and, stumbling occasionally, was off like  a railway train. Again we followed, two miles of desperate tramping in  that merciless sun, up hills and down hills, until finally we entirely  lost all trace of him. It was now two o'clock. I had eaten nothing since  five o'clock in the morning, my water bottle was so nearly empty that I  dared take only a swallow at a time, my knees were sore from climbing  hills and wading through the tall, dry prairie grass, and I decided to  give up this endless pursuit of a rhino who wouldn't die after being hit  with four cordite shells.    The dry creek bed lay in the course of our homeward march, and we  resolved to take a final look at it. There seemed no likelihood that the  lion was there, and I walked into the place with the supreme courage of  one who doesn't expect to find anything hostile. My head gunbearer and I  had crossed and were walking down in the grass at one side. My second  gunbearer was on the opposite side, and the stillness of death hung over  the burning plain.    There was not a sign of life in any direction. The second gunbearer was  instructed to set fire to the grass in the hope of awakening some  protest from the lion in case he was still in the vicinity. There was a  dry crackling of flames, and before we could count ten a deep growl came  from somewhere in front of me, evidently on one of the edges of the  creek bed. The second gunbearer was the first to locate him, and he  signaled for me to come over on his side of the creek. In a moment I had  dashed down and had climbed out on the other side and was eagerly gazing  at a clump of bushes indicated by the Kikuyu. At first I could  distinguish nothing, but soon I saw the tawny flanks and the lashing  tail of the lion. His head was hidden by the bushes. At that time we  were about a hundred yards from him and it was necessary to circle off  to a point where the rest of his body could be seen. A little side  ravine intervened, and I had to cross it and come directly down through  the clump of bushes. The grass was high, and it was not until I had come  within forty yards of the lion that I could get a clear view of him. He  was glaring at me, with tail waving angrily, and his mouth was opened in  a savage snarl. I could see that he didn't like me.    I raised the little .256 Mannlicher, aimed carefully at his open mouth  and fired. The lion turned a back somersault and a great thrill of  exultation suffused me. Already I saw the handsomely mounted lion-skin  rug ornamenting my den at home. We approached cautiously, always  remembering that the real danger of lion hunting comes after the lion  has been shot. We threw stones in the grass where he had lain, but no  answering growl was heard. I thought he was dead, but when we finally  reached the spot where he had been there was no sign of him. He had  vanished again. I searched the ravine and then crossed to the high grass  on the other side. Then we saw him for an instant, half-concealed, just  in front of us. His head was hanging, and he looked as though he had  been hard hit. Again he disappeared and we searched high and low for  him. For several hundred feet we beat the grass without result.    Then the grass was again fired and again the hoarse growl came in angry  protest. Walking slowly, with guns ready for instant use, we advanced  until we could see him under a tree seventy yards ahead on my side of  the ravine. He was growling angrily. This time I used the  double-barreled cordite rifle and the first shot struck him in the  forehead without knocking him down. He sprang up and the second shot  stretched him out. He was still alive when I came up to him, and a small  bullet was fired into the base of his brain to reduce the danger of a  final charge.    Old hunters always caution one about approaching a dying lion, for often  the beast musters up unexpected vitality, makes a final charge, kills  somebody, and then dies happy. So we waited a few feet away until the  last quiver of his sides had passed. One of the boys pulled his tail and  shook him, but there was no sign of life. He was extinct.    A new danger now threatened. The grass fire that the second gunbearer  had started was sweeping the prairie, fanned by a strong wind, and there  seemed to be not only the danger of abandoning the lion, but of being  forced to flee before the flames. So we fell to work beating out the  nearest fires, and trusted that a shifting of the wind would send the  course of the flames in another direction.    It was now four o'clock. We were nine miles from camp and food, and we  knew that at six o'clock darkness would suddenly descend, leaving us out  in a rhino-infested country, far from camp. The water was nearly gone  and the general outlook was far from pleasing.    The gunbearers skinned the lion. My first shot had struck one of his  back teeth, breaking it squarely off, and then passed through the fleshy  part of the neck. It was a wound that would startle, but not kill. The  second shot had hit him between the eyes, but had glanced off the skull,  merely ripping open the skin on the forehead for five inches. The third  shell had killed him, except for the convulsive heaving that was finally  stilled by the small bullet in the base of the brain.    [Drawing: _As I Planned to Look in the Photograph of \"My First  Lion\"_]    The skinning was interesting. All the fat in certain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2126"],[0,"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (#12)"],[1,"   Upon such slender evidence we could not justly assume that it  pointed to the presence of Dexter on the night of the attempted  robbery, but it served to complicate a matter already sufficiently  involved.    In pursuance of Bristol's plan, I concealed myself that evening  just before the closing of the Museum doors, in a recess behind a  heavy piece of Babylonian sculpture.  Bristol was similarly  concealed in another part of the room, and Mostyn joined us later.    The Museum was closed; and so far as evidence went the authorities  had relied again upon the bolts and bars hitherto considered  impregnable, and upon the constable in the hall.  The broken window  was mended, the cut blind replaced, and within, in its shattered  case, reposed the slipper of the Prophet.    All the blinds being lowered, the Assyrian Room was a place of  gloom, yellowed on the western side by the moonlight through the  blind.  The door communicating with the Burton Room was closed  but not fastened.    \"They operated last night,\" Bristol whispered to me, \"at the exact  time when the moonlight shone through the hole in the westerly  blind on to the case.  If they come to-night, and I am quite  expecting them, they will have to dispense with that assistance;  but they know by experience where to reach the case.\"    \"Despite our precautions,\" I said, \"they will almost certainly  know that a watch is being kept.\"    \"They may or they may not,\" replied Bristol.  \"Either way I'm  disposed to think there will be another attempt.  Their mysterious  method is so rapid that they can afford to take chances.\"    This was not my first night vigil since I had become in a sense the  custodian of the relic, but it was quite the most dreary.  Amid the  tomb-like objects about us we seemed two puny mortals toying with  stupendous things.  We could not smoke and must converse only in  whispers; and so the night wore on until I began to think that our  watch would be dully uneventful.    \"Our big chance,\" whispered Mostyn, \"is in the fact that any day  may change the conditions.  They can't afford to wait.\"    He ceased abruptly, grasping my arm.  From somewhere, somewhere  outside the building, we all three had heard a soft whistle.  A  moment of tense listening followed.    \"If only we could have had the place surrounded,\" whispered Bristol--\"but  it was impossible, of course.\"    A faint grating noise echoed through the lofty Burton Room.  Bristol  slipped past me in the semi-gloom, and gently opened the  communicating door a few inches.    A-tiptoe, I joined him, and craning across his shoulder saw a strange  and wonderful thing.    The newly glazed east window again was shattered with a booming  crash!  The yellow blind was thrust aside.  A long something reached  out toward the broken case.  There was a sort of fumbling sound, and  paralyzed with the wonder of it--for the window, remember, was  thirty feet from the ground--I stood frozen to my post.    Not so Bristol.  As the weird tentacle (or more exactly it reminded  me of a gigantic crab's claw) touched the case, the Inspector leapt  forward.  A white beam from his electric torch cut through to the  broken cabinet.    The thing was withdrawn ... and with it went the slipper of the  Prophet.    \"Raise the blinds!\" cried Bristol.  \"Mr. Cavanagh!  Mr. Mostyn!  We must not let them give us the slip!\"    I got up the blind of the nearer window as Bristol raised the other.  Not a living thing was in sight from either!    Mostyn was beside me, his hand resting on my shoulder.  I noted how  he trembled.  Bristol turned and looked back at us.  The light from  his pocket torch flashed upon the curator's face; and I have never  seen such an expression of horrified amazement as that which it  wore.  Faintly, I could hear the constable racing up the steps from  the hall.    Ideas of the supernatural came to us all, I know; when, with a  scuffling sound not unlike that of a rat in a ceiling, something moved  above us!    \"Damn my thick head!\" roared Bristol, furiously.  \"He's on the roof!  It's flat as a floor and there's enough ivy alongside the water-spout  on your house adjoining, Mr. Mostyn, to afford foothold to an  invading army!\"    He plunged off toward the open door, and I heard him racing down  the Assyrian Room.    \"He had a short rope ladder fixed from the gutter!\" he cried back  at us.  \"Graham!  Graham!\" (the constable on duty in the hall)--\"Get  the front door open!  Get...\"  His voice died away as he  leapt down the stairs.    From the direction of Orpington Square came a horrid, choking  scream.  It rose hideously; it fell, rose again--and died.    The thief escaped.  We saw the traces upon the ivy where he had  hastened down.  Bristol ascended by the same route, and found where  the ladder-hooks had twice been attached to the gutterway.  Constable  Graham, who was first actually to leave the building, declared that  he heard the whirr of a re-started motor lower down Great Orchard  Street.    Bristol's theory, later to be dreadfully substantiated, was that  the thief had broken the glass and reached into the case with an  arrangement similar to that employed for pruning trees, having a  clutch at the end, worked with a cord.    \"Hassan has been too clever for us!\" said the inspector.  \"But--what  in God's name did that awful screaming mean?\"    I had a theory, but I did not advance it then.    It was not until nearly dawn that my theory, and Bristol's, regarding  the clutch arrangement, both were confirmed.  For close under the  railings which abut on Orpington Square, in a pool of blood we found  just such an instrument as Bristol had described.    And still clutching it was a pallid and ghastly shrunken hand that  had been severed from above the wrist!    \"Merciful God!\" whispered the inspector--\"look at the opal ring on  the finger!  Look at the bandage where he cut himself on the  broken window-glass that first night, when Mr. Mostyn disturbed him.  It wasn't the Hashishin who stole the thing....  It's Earl  Dexter's hand!\"    No one spoke for a moment.  Then--    \"Which of them has--\" began Mostyn huskily.    \"The slipper of the Prophet?\" interrupted Bristol.  \"I wonder if we  shall ever know?\"          CHAPTER XV    A SHRIVELLED HAND      Around a large square table in a room at New Scotland Yard stood a  group of men, all of whom looked more or less continuously at  something that lay upon the polished deal.  One of the party, none  other than the Commissioner himself, had just finished speaking,  and in silence now we stood about the gruesome object which had  furnished him with the text of his very terse address.    I knew myself privileged in being admitted to such a conference at  the C.I.D. headquarters and owed my admission partly to Inspector  Bristol, and partly to the fact that under the will of the late  Professor Deeping I was concerned in the uncanny business we were  met to discuss.    Novelty has a charm for every one; and to find oneself immersed in  a maelstrom of Eastern devilry, with a group of scientific murderers  in pursuit of a holy Moslem relic, and unexpectedly to be made a  trustee of that dangerous curiosity, makes a certain appeal to the  adventurous.  But to read of such things and to participate in them  are widely different matters.  The slipper of the Prophet and the  dreadful crimes connected with it, the mutilations, murders, the  uncanny mysteries which made up its history, were filling my world  with horror.    Now, in silence we stood around that table at New Scotland Yard  and watched, as though we expected it to move, the ghastly \"clue\"  which lay there.  It was a shrivelled human hand, and about the  thumb and forefinger there still dryly hung a fragment of lint  which had bandaged a jagged wound.  On one of the shrunken fingers  was a ring set with a large opal.    Inspector Bristol broke the oppressive silence.    \"You see, sir,\" he said, addressing the Commissioner, \"this marks  a new complication in the case.  Up to this week although,  unfortunately, we had made next to no progress, the thing was  straightforward enough.  A band of Eastern murderers, working along  lines quite novel to Europe, were concealed somewhere in London.  We knew that much.  They murdered Professor Deeping, but failed to  recover the slipper.  They mutilated everyone who touched it  mysteriously.  The best men in the department, working night and  day, failed to effect a single arrest.  In spite of the mysterious  activity of Hassan of Aleppo the slipper was safely lodged in the  British Antiquarian Museum.\"    The Commissioner nodded thoughtfully.    \"There is no doubt,\" continued Bristol, \"that the Hashishin were  watching the Museum.  Mr. Cavanagh, here\"--he nodded in my  direction--\"saw Hassan himself lurking in the neighbourhood.  We  took every precaution, observed the greatest secrecy; but in  spite of it all a constable who touched the accursed thing lost  his right hand.  Then the slipper was taken.\"    He stopped, and all eyes again were turned to the table.    \"The Yard,\" resumed Bristol slowly, \"had information that Earl  Dexter, the cleverest crook in America, was in England.  He was  seen in the Museum, and the night following the slipper was stolen.  Then outside the place I found--that!\"    He pointed to the severed hand.  No one spoke for a moment.  Then--    \"The new problem,\" said the Commissioner, \"is this: who took the  slipper, Dexter or Hassan of Aleppo?\"    \"That's it, sir,\" agreed Bristol.  \"Dexter had two passages booked  in the Oceanic: but he didn't sail with her, and--that's his hand!\"    \"You say he has not been traced?\" asked the Commissioner.    \"No doctor known to the Medical Association,\" replied Bristol, \"is  attending him!  He's not in any of the hospitals.  He has completely  vanished.  The conclusion is obvious!\"    \"The evident deduction,\" I said, \"is that Dexter stole the slipper  from the Museum--God knows with what"]]]
