The next few minutes seemed like an age.  As we knelt in our half-  flooded boat scooping up the water there in our hats, or whatever would  serve for the purpose, we could hear ahead of us the angry roar of  breakers, and knew every moment was bringing us nearer to our doom.    By one impulse we abandoned our useless occupation.  What was the use of  baling out a boat that must inevitably in a few minutes be dashed to  pieces on the rocks?  Hutton crawled back into the bows, and Charlie and  I sat where we were on the seat and waited.    I could not fail, even in such a situation, to notice and admire Hall's  self-possession and coolness.  Desperate as our case was, he kept a  steady hand on the helm, and strained his eyes into the mist ahead,  never abating for a moment either his vigilance or his courage.  But  every now and then I could see his eyes turn for a moment to Charlie,  and his face twitch as they did so, with a look of pain which I was at  no loss to understand.    \"How far are we from the rocks?\" asked Charlie.    \"I can't say; a quarter of an hour, perhaps.\"    \"Whereabouts are we?\"  I asked.    \"When the lights went out we were opposite Raven Cliff,\" replied Hall.    We were silent for another minute; then Hall took out his watch.    \"Eight o'clock,\" said he.    \"They'll be at prayers at Parkhurst,\" said Charlie; and in the silence  that followed, need I say that we too joined as we had never done before  in the evening prayers of our schoolfellows?    \"Charlie, old boy,\" said Hall, presently, \"come and sit beside me, will  you?\"    Poor Hall! had it been only _his_ own life that was at stake, he would  never have flinched a muscle; but as he put his arm round the boy whom  he had led into danger he groaned pitiably.    \"I wonder if Neil's out looking for us,\" Hutton said from the bows.    \"Not much use,\" said Hall.  \"If only this mist would lift!\"    But it did not lift.  For another five minutes we tore through the  waves, which as we neared the shore became wilder and rougher.  Our  boat, half full of water, staggered at every shock, and more than once  we believed her last plunge had been taken.    On either side of us, for the little distance we could see through the  mist, there was nothing but white foam and surging billows; behind us  rushed the towering waves, overtaking us one by one, tossing us aloft  and dashing us down, till every board of our boat creaked and groaned.  Above us the rain poured in torrents, dashing on to our bare heads, and  blinding us whenever we turned our faces back.    Then Hall cried out, \"Listen! those must be breakers behind us!\"    Assuredly they were!  On either side we could hear the deafening thunder  of the surf as it dashed over the rocks.    \"Then, thank God!\" exclaimed Hall, \"we must have got in between two  reefs; perhaps we shall go aground on the sand!\"    The next two minutes are past description.  Hutton crawled down beside  me where I sat, and I could feel his hand on my arm, but I had no eyes  except for Charlie, who sat pale and motionless with Hall's arm round  him.    \"Now!\" shouted Hall, abandoning the tiller, and tightening his hold on  the boy.    There was a roar and a rush behind us, our boat swooped up with the  wave, and hung for a moment trembling on its crest, then it fell, and in  an instant we were in the water.    Hutton was beside me as the rush back of that huge wave swept us off our  feet.  I seized him by the arm, and next moment we were struggling to  keep our heads up.  Then came another monster, and lifted us like  straws, flinging us before it on to the strand, and then rolling and  foaming over us as we staggered to our feet.    Hutton, half stunned, had been swept from my hold, but mercifully was  still within reach.  Clutching him by the hair, I dragged him with all  my might towards the land, before the returning wave should once more  sweep us back into the sea.  By a merciful Providence, a solitary piece  of rock was at hand to aid us; and clinging to this we managed to  support that terrific rush, and with the next wave stagger on to solid  ground.    But what of Charlie?  Leaving my senseless companion, I rushed wildly  back to the water's edge, and called, shouted, and even waded back into  the merciless surf.  But no answer: no sign.  Who shall describe the  anguish of the next half-hour?  I was conscious of lights and voices; I  had dim visions of people hurrying; I felt something poured down my  throat, and some one was trying to lift me from where I sat.  But no!  I  would not leave that spot till I knew what had become of Charlie, and in  my almost madness I shrieked the boy's name till it sounded even above  the roaring waves.    Presently the lights moved all to one spot, and the people near me moved  too.  Weak as I was, I sprang to my feet and followed.    Good heavens! what did I see?  Two sailors, half naked, stooped over  something that lay on the sand between them, What, who was it?  I cried;  and the crowd made way for me as I fought my way to the place.    Two figures lay there; the smaller locked in the arms of his protector!  But dead or living?  Oh, if I could but hear some voice say they were  not dead!  Another person was kneeling over them beside me.  Even in  that moment of confusion and terror I could recognise his voice as that  of the Parkhurst doctor.    \"Look after this one here,\" he said; \"he has a broken arm.  Carry up the  little fellow to the cottage.\"    Then I knew Charlie was dead!    It was weeks before I was sufficiently recovered in body or mind to hear  more than I knew.  Then the doctor told me:--    \"Hall is getting better.  He broke his arm in two places, trying to  shield the boy from the rocks.  He will not speak about it himself, and  no one dares mention Archer's name to him.  There was neither bruise nor  scratch on the little fellow's body, which shows how heroically the  other must have tried to save him.\"    I soon recovered, but Hall was ill for many weeks--ill as much from  distress of mind as from the injuries he had received.  He and I are  firm friends to this day; and whenever we meet, we speak often of little  Charlie Archer.  Hall is a sea captain now, and commands his own vessel  in distant seas; but though he has been through many a peril and many a  storm since, I can confidently say he never showed himself a better  sailor than he did the night we sailed back from the Shargle.        CHAPTER SIX.    \"FIVERS\" VERSUS \"SIXERS\" AT PARKHURST.    \"I tell you what it is, you fellows, I shall learn to swim!\"  The  speaker was Bobby Jobson, a hero of some thirteen summers, who, in  company with four of us, his schoolfellows, sat on the bank of the  Colven, under some willows, dabbling his shins in the clear water of the  river.    The summer had been tremendously hot.  Cricket was out of the question,  and boating equally uninviting.  The playground had been left deserted  to bake and scorch under the fierce sun, and the swings and poles in the  gymnasium had blistered and cracked in solitude.  The only place where  life was endurable was down by the river, and even there it was far too  hot to do anything but sit and dabble our feet under the shelter of the  trees, and think of icebergs!    A few of the fellows, to our unbounded envy, bathed.  They could swim,  we could not; and if any rule at Parkhurst was strict, it was the rule  which forbade any boy who could not swim to bathe in the river, except  with special leave and under the care of a master.  And so, like so many  small editions of Tantalus, we sat on the bank and kicked our heels in  the water, and bemoaned the fate which had brought us into the world  without web-feet.    Young donkeys that we were!  The idea of _learning_ to swim had never  occurred to any of us till Bobby Jobson, in a happy moment, gave birth  to the idea in his ejaculation, \"I tell you what it is, you fellows, I  shall learn to swim!\"    \"How?\"  I inquired.    \"How?\" said Jobson; \"why, you know, how does every body learn?\" and then  he was polite enough to call me a duffer.    \"I'll tell you the way,\" said Ralley, one of our set.  \"Lie across a  desk on your stomach, two or three hours every day, and kick out with  your arms and legs.\"    \"Corks and bladders,\" mildly suggested some one else.    \"Get old Blades,\" (that was the boatman) \"to tie a rope round your  middle and chuck you into the Giant's Pool,\" kindly proposed another.    \"Just tumble in where you are,\" said Ralley, \"and see if it doesn't come  naturally.\"    \"Ugh!\" said Jobson, with a grimace, giving a sidekick in the water in  the direction of the last speaker.  \"I'm not sure that _that_ dodge  would pay.\"    While he spoke, to our unbounded horror, the bank on which he and his  next neighbour were sitting suddenly gave way, and next moment, with a  shout and a splash, our two comrades were floundering helplessly in five  feet of water!    Help, happily, was at hand, or there is no saying what might have been  the end of the adventure.  We did all we could by reaching out our hands  and throwing them our jackets to help them, while, with our shouts, we  summoned more effective aid.  Old Blades, who providentially happened to  be passing, was with us in less than a minute, and fished out the two  poor half-drowned boys, scarcely a moment before they needed it.  They  were more frightened, I fancy, than damaged; anyhow, we smuggled them  home, dripping as they were, and helped them to bed; and when, next  morning, they turned up as usual, nothing the worse for their first  swimming lesson, we were, as you may imagine, infinitely relieved.    This little adventure was the origin of the Parkhurst Swimming Club.  The doctor, on hearing of the affair, took the proper course; and,  instead of forbidding"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21138"],[0,"Love's Meinie: Three Lectures on Greek and English Birds (#12)"],[1,"of character; but deeply  significant of habit and power: thus the projecting, full, bead, which  enables the smaller birds to see the smallest insect or grain with good  in it, gives them much of their bright and often arch expression; while  the flattened iris under the beetling brow of the falcons,--projecting,  not in frown, but as roof, to shade the eye from interfering  skylight,--gives them their apparently threatening and ominous gaze;  the iris itself often wide and pale, showing as a lurid saturnine ring  under the shadow of the brow plumes.    87. I speak of things that are to be: very assuredly they will be done,  some day--not far off, by painters educated as gentlemen, in the  strictest sense--working for love and truth, and not for lust and gold.  Much has already been done by good and earnest draughtsmen, who yet had  not received the higher painter's education, which would have enabled  them to see the bird in the greater lights and laws of its form. It is  only here and there, by Duerer, Holbein, Carpaccio, or other such men,  that we get a living bird rightly drawn;[18] but we may be greatly  thankful for the unspared labor, and attentive skill, with which many  illustrations of ornithology have been produced within the last seventy  or eighty years. Far beyond rivalship among them, stands Le Vaillant's  monograph, or dualgraph, on the Birds of Paradise, and Jays: its  plates, exquisitely engraved, and colored with unwearying care by hand,  are insuperable in plume-texture, hue, and action,--spoiled in effect,  unhappily, by the vulgar boughs for sustentation. Next, ranks the  recently issued history of the birds of Lombardy; the lithographs by  Herr Oscar Dressler, superb, but the coloring (chromo-lithotint) poor:  and then, the self-taught, but in some qualities greatly to be  respected, art of Mr. Gould. Of which, I would fain have spoken with  gratitude and admiration in his lifetime; had not I known, that the  qualified expressions necessary for true estimate of his published  plates, would have caused him more pain, than any general praise could  have counteracted or soothed. Without special criticism, and rejoicing  in all the pleasure which any of my young pupils may take in his  drawing,--only guarding them, once for all, against the error of  supposing it exemplary as art,--I use his plates henceforward for  general reference; finding also that, following Mr. Gould's practical  and natural arrangement, I can at once throw together in groups, easily  comprehensible by British children, all they are ever likely to see of  British or Britain-visitant birds: which I find fall, with frank  casting, into these following divisions, not in any important matters  varying from the usual ones, and therefore less offensive, I hope, to  the normal zoologist than my heresies in botany; while yet they enable  me to make what I have to say about our native birds more simply  presentable to young minds.[19]          [18] The Macaw in Sir Joshua's portrait of the Countess of Derby        is a grand example.          [19] See the notes on classification, in the Appendix to the        volume; published, together with the Preface, simultaneously with        this number.    88.  1. The HAWKS come first, of course, massed under the single Latin  term 'Falco,' and next them,         2. The OWLS second, also of course,--unmistakable, these two tribes,  in all types of form, and ways of living.         3. The SWALLOWS I put next these, being connected with the owls by  the Goatsucker, and with the falcons by their flight.         4. The PIES next, whose name has a curious double meaning, derived  partly from the notion of their being painted or speckled birds; and  partly from their being, beyond all others, pecking, or pickax-beaked,  birds. They include, therefore, the Crows, Jays, and Woodpeckers;  historically and practically a most important order of creatures to  man. Next which, I take the great company of the smaller birds of the  dry land, under these following more arbitrary heads.         5. The SONGSTERS. The Thrush, Lark, Blackbird, and Nightingale, and  one or two choristers more. These are connected with the pheasants in  their speckledness, and with the pies in pecking; while the nightingale  leads down to the smaller groups of familiar birds.         6. The ROBINS, going on into the minor warblers, and the Wrens;  the essential character of a Robin being that it should have some front  red in its dress somewhere; and the Cross-bills being included in the  class, partly because they have red in their dress, and partly because  I don't know where else to put them.         7. The CREEPERS and TITS--separated chiefly on the ground of their  minuteness, and subtle little tricks and graces of movement.         8. The SPARROWS, going on into Buntings and Finches.         9. The PHEASANTS (substituting this specific name for that of  Scratchers).        10. The HERONS; for the most part wading and fishing creatures,  but leading up to the Stork, and including any long-legged birds that  run well, such as the Plovers.        11. The DABCHICKS--the subject of our present chapter.        12. The SWANS and GEESE.        13. The DUCKS.        14. The GULLS.    Of these, I take the Dabchicks first, for three sufficient reasons;--that  they give us least trouble,--that they best show what I mean by broad  principles of grouping,--and that they are the effective clasp, if not  center, of all the series; since they are the true link between land  and water birds. We will look at one or two of their leading examples,  before saying more of their position in bird-society. I shall give for  the heading of each article, the name which I propose for the bird in  English children's schools--_Dame_-schools if possible; a perfectly  simple Latin one, and a familiar English one. The varieties of existing  nomenclature will be given in the Appendix, so far as I think them  necessary to be known or remembered.      I.    MERULA FONTIUM.    TORRENT-OUZEL.    89. There are very few good popular words which do not unite two or  more ideas, being founded on one, and catching up others as they go  along. Thus I find 'dabchick' to be a corruption of 'dip-chick,'  meaning birds that only dip, and do not dive, or even duck, for any  length of time: but in its broader and customary use it takes up the  idea of dabbling; and, as a class-name, stands for 'dabbling-chick,'  meaning a bird of small size, that neither wades, nor dives, nor runs,  nor swims, nor flies, in a consistent manner; but humorously dabbles,  or dips, or flutters, or trips, or plashes, or paddles, and is always  doing all manner of odd and delightful things: being also very  good-humored, and in consequence, though graceful, inclined to  plumpness;[20] and though it never waddles, sometimes, for a minute or  two, 'toddles,' and now and then looks more like a ball than a bird.  For the most part, being clever, they are also brave, and would be as  tame as any other chickens, if we would let them. They are mostly shore  birds, living at the edge of irregularly broken water, either streams  or sea; and the representative of the whole group with which we will  begin is the mysterious little water-ouzel, or 'oiselle,' properly the  water-blackbird,--Buffon's 'merle d'eau'--for ouzel is the classic and  poetic word for the blackbird, or ouzel-_cock_, \"so black of hue,\" in  'Midsummer Night's Dream.' Johnson gives it from the Saxon 'osle'; but  in Chaucer it must be understood simply as the feminine of oiseau. The  bird in question might, however, be more properly called, as Bewick  calls it, 'water pyot,' or water magpie, for only its back and wings  are black,--its head brown, and breast snow white.          [20] Or in French, 'embonpoint.'    90. And now I must, once for all, get over a difficulty in the  description of birds' costume. I can always describe the neck-feathers,  as such, when birds have any neck to speak of; but when, as the  majority of dabchicks, they have not any,--instead of talking of  'throat-feathers' and 'stomach-feathers,' which both seem to me rather  ugly words, I shall call the breast feathers the 'chemisette,' and all  below them the 'bodice.'    I am now able, without incivility, to distinguish the two families of  Water-ouzel. Both have white chemisettes, but the common water-ouzel  (Cinclus aquaticus of Gould) has a white bodice, and the other a black  one, the bird being called therefore, in ugly Greek, 'Melanogaster,'  'black-stomached.' The black bodice is Norwegian fashion--the white,  English; and I find that in Switzerland there is an intermediate  Robin-ouzel, with a red bodice: but the ornithologists are at variance  as to his 'specific' existence. The chemisette is always white.    91. However dressed, and wherever born, the Ouzel is essentially a  mountain-torrent bird, and, Bewick says, may be seen perched on a stone  in the midst of a stream, in a continual _dipping_ motion, or short  curtsey often repeated, while it is watching for its food, which  consists of small fishes and insects,--water insects, that is to say,  caught mostly at the bottom; many-legged and shrimpy things, according  to Gould's plate. The popular tradition that it can walk under the  water has been denied by scientific people; but there is no doubt  whatever of the fact,--see the authentic evidence of it in the  delightful little monograph of the bird published by the Carlisle  Naturalist's Society; but how the thing is done nobody but the ouzel  knows. Its strong little feet, indeed, have plenty of grip in them, but  cannot lay hold of smooth stones, and Mr. Gould himself does not solve  the problem. \"Some assert that it is done by clinging to the pebbles  with its strong claws; others, by considerable exertion and a rapid  movement of the wings. Its silky plumage is impervious to wet; and  hence when the bird returns to the surface, the"]]]
