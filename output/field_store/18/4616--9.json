The real jaws of the insect  are underneath the lower horn, which projects from the forepart of  the head. The under surface of the thorax-horn carries a ridge of  stiff, short, golden-yellow hairs, and the under surface and edges  of the abdomen are similarly ornamented.    The head, thorax, and legs are shining black; the elytra, or  wing-covers, are olive-green, dotted with black spots, and are much  wrinkled. The wings are large and powerful.    [Illustration: THE HERCULES BEETLE]    The female Hercules is quite unlike the male. It is much smaller,  being not more than three and a half inches long, is without horns,  and is covered with a brown hairy felt.    These beetles are nocturnal in habit, and are rarely seen in the  daytime, except in dark hiding places in the recesses of Brazilian  forests.           *       *       *       *       *          A POULTERER'S VIEW OF MECHANICAL POULTRY RAISING.      A prominent dealer in poultry, Mr. H. W. Knapp, of Washington Market,  gives a discouraging opinion of the probable success of chicken raising  by artificial means in this country. He said recently when questioned on  this subject by a representative of the _Evening Post_:    \"I went to France to study the matter, for if it can be made to succeed  it will make an immense fortune, as it has already done in Paris. I was  delighted with what I saw there, and the matter at first sight seems to  be so fascinating that I do not wonder that new men here are always  ready to take hold of it as soon as those who have bought dear  experience are only too glad to get out of it. Even clergymen and actors  are bitten with the desire to transform so many pounds of corn into so  many pounds of spring chicken. The now successful manager, Mackaye,  spent about a thousand dollars, in constructing hatching machines and  artificial mothers in Connecticut, but he found that the stage paid  better, and his expensive devices may now be bought for the value of old  tin.    \"Enthusiasts will tell you that by the new discovery chickens may be  made out of corn with absolute certainty. In Paris this has been done;  but the conditions are entirely different here. There the land is  valuable, and they cannot devote large fields to a few hundred chickens;  the French climate is so uniform that the markets of Paris cannot be  supplied from the south with produce which ripens or matures before that  of the neighborhood of Paris; the price of chickens is so high and labor  so cheap that more care can be given with profit to one spring chicken  than one of our poultry raisers could give to a dozen. Here we have  plenty of land, the climate south of us is so far advanced in warmth  that even with steam we cannot raise poultry ahead of the south, and the  margin of profit is so small that one failure with a large batch of  chickens sweeps away the profits from several successful experiments.    \"When persons wanted me to go into the project I declined and was called  an old fogy. One man spent a fortune on the enterprise in New Jersey,  and at first was hailed as a public benefactor. What was the result of  all his outlay and work? He managed to hatch quantities of young  chickens every February, but although he could fatten them by placing  them in boxes and forcing a fattening mixture down their throats, he  could not make them grow; they had no exercise; they remained puny  little things, and another defect soon appeared: though fat they were  tough and stringy. The breeder sent lots of them to me, and they looked  fat and tender; but my customers complained that they could not be  young, for they were tough and tasteless, and that I must have sold them  aged dwarfs under the name of spring chickens. It was found absolutely  necessary to let them run out of doors as soon as the weather allowed  it, and by the time that they were ready for market the southern  chickens were here and could be sold for less than these. The upshot of  the business is that this breeder has sold out, and another man has now  taken hold of a small part of his old establishment to try other methods  of making it a success.    \"As to raising turkeys in that manner it will tail more disastrously  than the chicken business. Size and weight are wanted in turkeys; and  that reminds me,\" continued Mr. Knapp, \"that the newspapers ought to  impress the country people with the necessity of improving their poultry  stock; breeding in and in is ruining poultry; every year the stock we  receive is deteriorating, and this is the cause. I could give you some  striking examples from my experience of forty years in the business.  Some years ago we poulterers thought that ducks were going to disappear  from bills of fare altogether; they were tasteless, worthless birds  which people avoided. On Long Island a farmer made experiments in  breeding with an old Muscovy drake, tough as an alligator, and the  common duck. The result was superb and has changed the whole duck  industry. If the farmers of Southern New Jersey, the sandy country best  suited to turkeys, would bring from the West a few hundred wild turkeys  we should have an immediate improvement. I see no such turkey now as we  had twenty years ago. The breast is narrow and the body runs to length;  it is all neck and legs, and can be bought by the yard. Rhode Island  sends us the best turkeys, but they are not what they used to be. If,  instead of attempting to beat nature at her own game, the rich men who  have money to spend would devote it to better breeding, there would be  an improvement. I do not yet despair of seeing immense farms wholly  devoted to raising better poultry than we yet have.\"           *       *       *       *       *          THE EMBRACE OF THE MANTIS.      Mr. Addison Ellsworth favors us with a transcript of a letter from Mr.  Albert D. Rust, of Ennis, Ellis County, Texas, describing a remarkable  exhibition of copulative cannibalism on the part of the mantis. The  ferocious nature of these strange insects is well known, and is in  striking contrast with the popular name, \"praying mantis,\" which they  have gained by the pious attitude they take while watching for the flies  and other insects which they feed upon.    About sunrise, August 28, 1880, Mr. Rust's attention was attracted by a  pair of mantis, whether _Mantis religiosa_ or not, he was not sure, but  from the length of the body and the shortness of the wings he was  inclined to think them of some other species. The female had her arms  tightly clasped around the head of the male, while his left arm was  around her neck. Mr. Rust watched intently to see whether the embrace  was one of war or for copulation. It proved to be both. As the two  abdomens began to approach each other the female made a ferocious attack  upon the male, greedily devouring his head, a part of the body, and all  the arm that had encircled her neck. A moment after the eating began,  Mr. Rust observed a complete union of the sexual organs, and the eating  and copulation went on together. On being forcibly separated the female  exhibited signs of fear at her headless mate, and it was with difficulty  that they were brought together again. On being suddenly tossed upon the  back of the female the male seized her with a grasp from which she could  not extricate herself, and immediately the sexual union was renewed, to  all appearances as perfectly as before.    The pair were accidentally killed, otherwise, Mr. Rush thinks, the  female would have continued her cannibalistic repast until she had  devoured the entire body of her companion.    This peculiarity of the mantis seems not to have been observed before,  though their mutually destructive disposition has been noted by several.  Desiring to study the development of these insects, M. Roesel raised a  brood of them from a bag of eggs. Though plentifully supplied with  flies, the young mantis fought each other constantly, the stronger  devouring the weaker, until but one was left.    M. Poiret was not more successful. When a pair of mantis were put  together in a glass they fought viciously, the fight ending with the  decapitation of the male and his being eaten by the female.           *       *       *       *       *          VARIEGATION OF LEAVES.    BY JAMES HOGG.      At the meeting of the Association of Nurserymen in Chicago, last July,  one of our prominent horticulturists described leaf variegation as a  disease. Incidentally this brought up the question: Does the graft  affect the stock upon which it is inserted?    Much confusion of ideas exists upon this subject, largely due to a loose  application of the term disease. Strictly speaking, this term is only  applicable to that which shows the health of the plant to be impaired.  It should be distinguished from aberrant or abnormal forms, for these  are not necessarily indicative of disease. Nobody thinks of saying that  red or striped roses are diseased because they are departures in color  from the white flower of the type species; or that white, yellow, or  striped roses are diseased when the color of the type species is red.  Nobody thinks of saying that double flowers are evidences of disease in  the plant, or that diminution in the size of leaves or variation in  their form is a disease. Why then should it be said that because leaves  may become of some other color than green, or become party-colored,  therefore they are diseased? If it be said that flowers are not leaves,  and that therefore the analogy is not a good one, the reply is, that  flowers in all their parts, and fruits also, are only leaves differently  developed from the type. This fact is a proven one, and so admitted to  be by all botanists and vegetable physiologists of the present day. If  it be objected that by becoming double, flowers lose the power of  reproducing the variety or species, the answer is, that this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21091"],[0,"The Life of William Ewart Gladstone, Vol. 1 (of 3) (#12)"],[1,"school with vacant       space and terror all around him, it must be hard for any one to       conceive, except the two who were the subjects of it. Never, never,       have I forgotten that moment.[32]         I will now, after the manner of novelists, ask my reader to effect       along with me, a transition of some eighteen years, and to witness       another, and if not a more complete yet a worthier, turning of the       tables. In the year 1841 there was a very special Eton dinner held       in Willis's Rooms to commemorate the fourth centenary of the       ancient school. Lord Morpeth, afterwards Lord Carlisle, was in the       chair. On his right, not far off him, was Dr. Keate, to whom I       chanced to have a seat almost immediately opposite. In those days,       at public dinners, cheering was marked by gradations. As the Queen       was suspected of sympathy with the liberal government of Lord       Melbourne which advised her, the toast of the sovereign was       naturally received with a moderate amount of acclamation, decently       and thriftily doled out. On the other hand the Queen Dowager either       was, or was believed to be, conservative; and her health       consequently figured as the toast of the evening, and drew forth,       as a matter of course, by far its loudest acclamation. So much was       routine; and we went through it as usual. But the real toast of the       evening was yet to come. I suppose it to be beyond doubt that of       the assembled company the vastly preponderating majority had been       under his sway at Eton; and if, when in that condition, any one of       them had been asked how he liked Dr. Keate, he would beyond       question have answered, 'Keate? Oh, I hate him.' It is equally       beyond doubt that to the persons of the whole of them, with the       rarest exceptions, it had been the ease of Dr. Keate to administer       the salutary correction of the birch. But upon this occasion, when       his name had been announced the scene was indescribable. Queen and       Queen Dowager alike vanished into insignificance. The roar of       cheering had a beginning, but never knew satiety or end. Like the       huge waves at Biarritz, the floods of cheering continually       recommenced; the whole process was such that we seemed all to have       lost our self-possession and to be hardly able to keep our seats.       When at length it became possible Keate rose: that is to say, his       head was projected slightly over the heads of his two neighbours.       He struggled to speak; I will not say I heard every syllable, for       there were no syllables; speak he could not. He tried in vain to       mumble a word or two, but wholly failed, recommenced the vain       struggle and sat down. It was certainly one of the most moving       spectacles that in my whole life I have witnessed.                                        IV                                 AT WILMSLOW    Some months passed between leaving Eton and going to Oxford. In January  1828, Gladstone went to reside with Dr. Turner at Wilmslow in Cheshire,  and remained there until Turner was made Bishop of Calcutta. The  bishop's pupil afterwards testified to his amiability, refinement, and  devoutness; but the days of his energy were past, and 'the religious  condition of the parish was depressing.' Among the neighbouring  families, with whom he made acquaintance while at Wilmslow, were the  Gregs of Quarry Bank, a refined and philanthropic household, including  among the sons William R. Greg (born in the same year as Mr. Gladstone),  that ingenious, urbane, interesting, and independent mind, whose  speculations, dissolvent and other, were afterwards to take an effective  place in the writings of the time. 'I fear he is a unitarian,' the young  churchman mentions to his father, and gives sundry reasons for that  sombre apprehension; it was, indeed, only too well founded.    While at Wilmslow (Feb. 5, 1828) Gladstone was taken to dine with the  rector of Alderley--'an extremely gentlemanly and said to be a very  clever man,'--afterwards to be known as the liberal and enlightened  Edward Stanley, Bishop of Norwich, and father of Arthur Stanley, the  famous dean. Him, on this occasion, the young Gladstone seems to have  seen for the first time. Arthur Stanley was six years his junior, and  there was then some idea of sending him to Eton. As it happened, he too  was a pupil at Rawson's at Seaforth, and in the summer after the  meeting at Alderley the two lads met again. The younger of them has  described how he was invited to breakfast with William Gladstone at  Seaforth House; in what grand style they breakfasted, how he devoured  strawberries, swam the Newfoundland dog in the pond, looked at books and  pictures, and talked to W. Gladstone 'almost all the time about all  sorts of things. He is so very good-natured, and I like him very much.  He talked a great deal about Eton, and said that it was a very good  place for those who liked boating and Latin verses. He was very  good-natured to us all the time, and lent me books to read when we went  away.'[33] A few months later, as all the world knows, Stanley, happily  for himself and for all of us, went not to Eton but to Rugby, where  Arnold had just entered on his bold and noble task of changing the face  of education in England.

[26] Doyle tells a story of the boy being flogged for bringing wine into  his study. When questioned on this, Mr. Gladstone said, 'I _was_  flogged, but not for anything connected in any way with wine, of which,  by the by, my father supplied me with a small amount, and insisted upon  my drinking it, or some of it, all the time that I was at Eton. The  reason why I was flogged was this. I was praepostor of the remove on a  certain day, and from kindness or good nature was induced to omit from  the list of boys against whom H. [the master] had complained, and who  ought to have been flogged next day, the names of three offenders. The  three boys in question got round me with a story that their friends were  coming down from London to see them, and that if they were put down on  the flogging list they could not meet their friends. Next day when I  went into school H. roared out in a voice of thunder, \"Gladstone, put  down your own name on the list of boys to be flogged.\"' Mr. Gladstone on  this occasion told another tale of this worthy's 'humour.' 'One day H.  called out to the praepostor, \"Write down Hamilton's name to be flogged  for breaking my window.\" \"I never broke your window, sir,\" exclaimed  Hamilton. \"Praepostor,\" retorted H., \"write down Hamilton's name for  breaking my window and lying.\" \"Upon my soul, sir, I did not do it,\"  ejaculated the boy, with increased emphasis. \"Praepostor, write down  Hamilton's name for breaking my window, lying, and swearing.\" Against  this final sentence there was no appeal, and, accordingly, Hamilton was  flogged (I believe unjustly) next day.'--F. Lawley in _Daily Telegraph_,  May 20, 1898.    [27] _Temple Bar_, Feb. 1883.    [28] Feb. 10, 1827.

CHAPTER III                                    OXFORD                       (_October 1828-December 1831_)         Steeped in sentiment as she lies, spreading her gardens to the       moonlight, and whispering from her towers the last enchantments of       the Middle Age, who will deny that Oxford, by her ineffable charm,       keeps ever calling us nearer to the true goal of all of us, to the       ideal, to perfection--to beauty, in a word, which is only truth       seen from another side?--M. ARNOLD.      Glorious to most are the days of life in a great school, but it is at  college that aspiring talent first enters on its inheritance. Oxford was  slowly awakening from a long age of lethargy. Toryism of a stolid  clownish type still held the thrones of collegiate power. Yet the eye of  an imaginative scholar as he gazed upon the grey walls, reared by piety,  munificence, and love of learning in a far-off time, might well discern  behind an unattractive screen of academic sloth, the venerable past, not  dim and cold, but in its traditions rich, nourishing, and alive. Such an  one could see before him present days of honourable emulation and  stirring acquisition--fit prelude of a man's part to play in a strenuous  future. It is from Gladstone's introduction into this enchanted and  inspiring world, that we recognise the beginning of the wonderful course  that was to show how great a thing the life of a man may be made.                               CHRIST CHURCH    The Eton boy became the Christ Church man, and there began residence,  October 10, 1828. Mr. Gladstone's rooms, during most of his  undergraduate life, were on the right hand, and on the first floor of  the staircase on the right, as one enters by the Canterbury gate. He  tells his mother that they are in a very fashionable part of the  college, and mentions as a delightful fact, that Gaskell and Seymer  have rooms on the same floor. Samuel Smith was head until 1831, when he  was succeeded by the more celebrated Dr. Gaisford, always described by  Mr. Gladstone as a splendid scholar, but a bad dean. Gaisford's  excellent services to the Greek learning of his day are unquestioned,  and he had the signal merit of speech, Spartan brevity. For a short time  in 1806 he had been tutor to "]]]
