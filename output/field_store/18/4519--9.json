Long before the time for the dance a line  of four immense fires burned on each side of the avenue where the dance  was to take place, and Navajo men and women clad in their bright colored  blankets and all their rare beads and silver encircled each fire. Logs  were piled 5 or 6 feet high. In addition to these eight fires there were  many others near and far, around which groups of gamblers gathered, all  gay and happy. Until this night no women but those who carried food to the  lodge had been present at any of the ceremonies except at the initiation  of the children. To say that there were 1,200 Navajo would be a moderate  calculation. This indeed was a picture never to be forgotten. Many had  been the objections to our sketching and writing, but throughout the nine  days the song-priest stood steadfastly by us. One chief in particular  denounced the theurgist for allowing the medicine to be put on paper and  carried to Washington. But his words availed nothing. We were treated with  every consideration. We were allowed to handle the masks and examine them  closely, and at times the artists working at the sand painting really  inconvenienced themselves and allowed us to crowd them that we might  observe closely the many minute details which otherwise could not have  been perceived, as many of their color lines in the skirt and sash  decorations were like threads. The accompanying sketches show every  detail.    The green or dressing room was a circular inclosure of pine boughs at the  end of the avenue. It was about 10 feet high by 20 feet in diameter made  of pinon branches with their butts planted in the ground, their tops  forming a brush or hedge. Within this inclosure the masks were arranged in  a row on the west side. A large fire burned in the center affording both  heat and light. The different sets, when a change of dress from one set of  men to another was to be made, repaired to this green room for that  purpose. This inclosure was also the resort during the night for many  Indians who assisted the dancers in their toilets.    At 10 o'clock the ceremonies opened by the entrance upon the avenue of the  song-priest who came from the green room. He wore a rich red blanket and  over this a mountain lion skin; immediately after him followed Hasjelti,  leading the four Etsethle (the first ones). These represented first, natan  (corn); second, natin (rain); third, nanase (vegetation); fourth, jadetin  (corn pollen). Their masks were blue ornamented with feathers and were  similar to the masks worn by the dancers; their bodies were painted white  with many rare beads around their necks, and they wore loin skirts with  silver belts; a gray fox skin was attached pendant to the back of the  belt, and blue stockings, tied with red garters, and moccasins completed  their dress. They carried in their right hands gourd rattles painted  white. The handles of these may be of any kind of wood, but it must be  selected from some tree near which lightning has struck, but not of the  wood of the tree struck by lightning. Corn pollen was in the palms of  their left hands and in the same hand they carried also a pinon bough.  Hasjelti wore a suit of velvet ornamented with silver buttons; he never  speaks except by signs. They advanced single file with a slow regular step  and when within 20 feet of the lodge the priest turned and faced Hasjelti  and repeated a short prayer, when the Etsethle sang.        SONG OF THE ETSETHLE.        From below (the earth) my corn comes      I walk with you.    From above water young (comes)      I walk with you.    From above vegetation (comes to the earth)      I walk with you.    From below the earth corn pollen comes      I walk with you.    These lines are repeated four times. The first line indicates that corn is  the chief subsistence; the second, that it is necessary to pray to  Hasjelti that the earth may be watered; the third, that the earth must be  embraced by the sun in order to have vegetation; the fourth, that pollen  is essential in all religious ceremonies. The Etsethle signify doubling  the essential things by which names they are known, corn, grain, etc.,  they are the mystic people who dwell in canyon sides unseen. After the  song the invalid with meal basket in hand passed hurriedly down the line  of gods and sprinkled each one with meal, passing it from the right hand  up to the right arm, to the head then down the left arm to the hand,  placing a pinch in the palm of the left hand. The invalid then returned  and stood to the north side of Hasjelti who was to the left of the  song-priest. The theurgist stood facing natan (corn) and offered a prayer  which was repeated by the invalid. Continency must be observed by the  invalid during the nine days ceremonial and for four days thereafter.        PRAYER TO THE ETSETHLE.      \"People, you come to see us; you have a house in the heart of the rocks;  you are the chief of them; you are beautiful. Come inside of our houses.  Your feet are white; come into our house! Your legs are white; come into  our house! Your bodies are white; come into our house! Your face is white;  come into our house! Old man, this world is beautiful; the people look  upon you and they are happy. This day let all things be beautiful.\"    This prayer is repeated many times, merely substituting for old man old  woman, then youth, young girl, boy, then all children. The old man and  woman spoken of are not the first old man and woman in the myth of the old  man and woman of the first world. After the prayer the song-priest and  invalid took seats by the entrance of the lodge. Hasjelti took his  position to the west end and to the north of the line of the Etsethle. He  remained standing while the four slowly raised the right foot squarely  from the ground, then on the toe of the left foot, which motion shook the  rattle. In a short time Hasjelti passed down the line hooting. He passed  around the east end, then returned up the north side to his former  position, and again hooting, resumed the leadership of the Etsethle, who  gave a long shake of the rattle as soon as Hasjelti stood in front of  them. They then followed their leader to the dressing room.          CONCLUSION - THE DANCE.      The song-priest having returned to the green room, emerged therefrom,  followed by Hasjelti, who carried a fawn skin partially filled with meal,  and by twelve dancers and Hostjoghon, holding in each hand a feather wand.  The twelve dancers represented the old man and woman six times duplicated.  Hasjelti led the dancers and Hostjoghon followed in the rear. When they  came near the lodge the song-priest turned and faced the dancers, and  being joined by the invalid, he led him down the line of dancers on the  north side, the invalid carrying a sacred meal basket, and sprinkled the  right side of each dancer. The song-priest and invalid then returned to  their seats in front of the lodge. Hasjelti passed down the line on the  north side and joined Hostjoghon at the east end of the line, both then  passing to the west end, where each one endeavored to be the first to  stamp twice upon the ground immediately in front of the leading dancer.  This double stamp is given with hoots, and they then returned down the  line to the center, when Hasjelti dashes back to the west end, clasping  the throat of the fawn skin with his right hand and holding the legs with  his left, with both his arms extended to the front. Hostjoghon extending  his hands with the feather wands in them, they point the head of the skin  and tops of the wands directly in front of them as they stand facing each  other, hooting at the same time. Reversing sides by dashing past each  other, Hasjelti points his fawn skin to the east while Hostjoghon points  his wands to the west. They then return to their respective positions as  leader and follower.    After the dance begins Hasjelti passes down the north side and joins  Hostjoghon at the east end of the dancers, Hasjelti keeping to the north  side of Hostjoghon. Three of the men, representing women, were dressed in  Navajo squaw dresses and three of them in Tusayan squaw dresses; they held  their arms horizontally to the elbow and the lower arm vertically, and,  keeping their feet close together, raised themselves simultaneously on  their toes. The dance was begun in single file, the men raising only their  right feet to any height and balancing on the left. After a minute or two  the line broke, the women passing over to the north side and the men to  the south side; almost instantaneously, however, they grouped into a  promiscuous crowd, women carrying a pine twig in each hand and the men a  gourd rattle in the right hand and a pine twig in the left. The men's  bodies were painted white and were nude, excepting the silk scarfs and  mountain lion and other skins worn around the loins. Just before the  stamping of the feet in the beginning of the dance, a rattle was shaken by  all the male dancers, which was the signal for a peculiar back motion of  the right arm and body and one which preceded the actual dancing. The six  males lean their bodies to the right side extending the right hand  backward, and then bringing it forward in a circular under sweep around to  the mouth with a hoot. They then turn and face the east, and bending their  bodies toward the south perform the same motion as before, when they turn  to the west and repeat it in that direction. At the same time the leader  and follower repeat their peculiar performance with the fawn skin and  wands to the east and west. Dancing promiscuously for a few moments to  song and rattle, the men representing women singing in feminine tones,  they form again in two lines, the women as before on the north side. The  man at the west end of the male line and the woman at the same end of the  female line, meeting each other midway between the lines she passes her  right arm through the arm of her"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19337"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#12)"],[1," you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blessed  in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can say is, I should like to  know him too. Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.    It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that, while there  is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so  irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge's  nephew laughed in this way, holding his sides, rolling his head, and  twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions, Scrooge's  niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled  friends, being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.    \"Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!\"    \"He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!\" cried Scrooge's  nephew. \"He believed it, too!\"    \"More shame for him, Fred!\" said Scrooge's niece indignantly. Bless  those women! they never do anything by halves. They are always in  earnest.    She was very pretty; exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,  surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made  to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about  her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the  sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature's head.  Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but  satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory!    \"He's a comical old fellow,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that's the truth;  and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their  own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.\"    \"I'm sure he is very rich, Fred,\" hinted Scrooge's niece. \"At least, you  always tell _me_ so.\"    \"What of that, my dear?\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"His wealth is of no use  to him. He don't do any good with it. He don't make himself comfortable  with it. He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is  ever going to benefit Us with it.\"    \"I have no patience with him,\" observed Scrooge's niece. Scrooge's  niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.    \"Oh, I have!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"I am sorry for him; I couldn't be  angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself always.  Here he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine  with us. What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner.\"    \"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,\" interrupted Scrooge's  niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have  been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and, with the  dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamp-light.    \"Well! I am very glad to hear it,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"because I  haven't any great faith in these young housekeepers. What do _you_ say,  Topper?\"    Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters,  for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right  to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge's niece's  sister--the plump one with the lace tucker, not the one with the  roses--blushed.    \"Do go on, Fred,\" said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands. \"He never  finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!\"    Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and, as it was impossible to  keep the infection off, though the plump sister tried hard to do it with  aromatic vinegar, his example was unanimously followed.    \"I was only going to say,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that the consequence  of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I  think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm.  I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own  thoughts, either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers. I mean  to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for  I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help  thinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there in good  temper, year after year, and saying, 'Uncle Scrooge, how are you?' If it  only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, _that's_  something; and I think I shook him yesterday.\"    It was their turn to laugh, now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.  But, being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they  laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in  their merriment, and passed the bottle, joyously.    After tea they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew  what they were about when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you:  especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and  never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over  it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and played, among other  tunes, a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle  it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who fetched  Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost  of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things  that Ghost had shown him came upon his mind; he softened more and more;  and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he  might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with  his own hands, without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob  Marley.    But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After awhile they  played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never  better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.  Stop! There was first a game at blindman's buff. Of course there was.  And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes  in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and  Scrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The  way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on  the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling  over the chairs, bumping up against the piano, smothering himself  amongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew  where the plump sister was. He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had  fallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose, he would have  made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an  affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in  the direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn't  fair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he caught her; when, in  spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him,  he got her into a corner whence there was no escape, then his conduct  was the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his  pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to  assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her  finger, and a certain chain about her neck, was vile, monstrous! No  doubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in  office, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.    Scrooge's niece was not one of the blindman's buff party, but was made  comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where  the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the  forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the  alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very  great, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her sisters  hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.  There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all  played, and so did Scrooge; for, wholly forgetting, in the interest he  had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he  sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed  right, too, for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to  cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in his  head to be.    The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon  him with such favour, that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay  until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.    \"Here is a new game,\" said Scrooge. \"One half-hour, Spirit, only one!\"    It was a game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of  something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their  questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to  which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an  animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an  animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes, and  lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn't made a show  of, and wasn't led by anybody, and didn't live in a menagerie, and was  never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a  bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every  fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar  of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to  get up off the sofa, and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a  similar state, cried out:    \"I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!\"    \"What is it?\" cried Fred.    \"It's your uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!\"    Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though  some objected that the reply to \"Is it a bear?\" ought to have been  \"Yes\": inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have  diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had  any tendency that way.    \"He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,\" said Fred, \"and it  would be ungrateful not"]]]
