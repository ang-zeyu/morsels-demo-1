The life of the frontier at a time when all life was so  much ruder than now was as fierce, if not as cruel, among the white men  as among the red men.    The murderers at Mingo Bottom voted whether Colonel David Williamson or  Colonel William Crawford should lead them, and their choice fell upon  Crawford. He seems to have been a man of kinder heart than his fellows,  and he unwillingly took command of the turbulent and disorderly band,  which promptly set out on its march through the wilderness towards the  Sandusky country. They had hoped to surprise the Indians, but spies  had watched their movements from the first, and when they reached the  Moravian villages on the Sandusky River, they found them deserted. They  decided then to go on toward Upper Sandusky, and if they could not reach  that town in a day's march, to beat a quick retreat. The next day they  started, but at two o'clock in the afternoon they were attacked by large  numbers of Indians hidden in the tall grass of the prairies, and they  fought a running battle till nightfall. Then both sides kindled large  fires along their lines, and fell back from them to prevent a surprise.    In the morning the Americans began their retreat, and the Indians  renewed their attack with great fury in the afternoon, on all sides  except the northeast, where the invaders were hemmed in by swamps. There  seems to have been no cause for their retreat, except the danger of an  overwhelming onset by the savages, which must have been foreseen  from the start. But the army, as it was called, was wholly without  discipline; during the night not even a sentry had been posted; and now  their fear became a panic, their retreat became a rout. They made their  way as best they could through the marshes, where the horses stuck fast,  and had to be abandoned, and the men themselves sometimes sank to their  necks in the soft ooze. Instead of keeping together, as Crawford advised  but had no power to compel, the force broke up into small parties, which  the Indians destroyed or captured. Many perished in the swamps; some  were followed as far as the Ohio River. The only one of the small  parties which escaped was that of forty men under Colonel Williamson,  the leader of the Gnadenhiitten massacre, who enjoyed the happier  fortune denied to Colonel Crawford.    This ill-fated officer was tormented after the retreat began by his fear  for the safety of his son, his son-in-law, and his nephews, and he left  his place at the head of the main body and let the army file past him  while he called and searched for the missing men. He did not try to  overtake it till it was too late to spur his wearied horse forward. He  fell in with Dr. John Knight, who accompanied the expedition as surgeon,  and who now generously remained with Crawford. They pushed on together  with two others through the woods, guided by the north star, but on the  second day after the army had left them behind, a party of Indians fell  upon them and made them prisoners.    Their captors killed their two companions, Captain Biggs and Lieutenant  Ashley, the following day, but Crawford and Knight were taken to an  Indian camp at a little distance, and then to the old Wyandot town of  Sandusky, where preparations were made for burning Crawford. He seems to  have had great hopes that Simon Girty, who was then at Sandusky, would  somehow manage to save him, and it is said that the renegade really  offered three hundred dollars for Crawford's life, knowing that he would  be many times repaid by Crawford's friends. But the chief whom Girty  tried to bribe answered, \"Do you take me for a squaw?\" and threatened,  if Girty said more, to burn him along with Crawford. This is the story  told in Girty's favor; other stories represent him as indifferent if not  cruel to Crawford throughout. In any case, it ended in Crawford's return  to the Indian camp, eight miles from the Indian town, where he suffered  death.    The chiefs who had been put in charge of him were two Delawares of great  note, Captain Pipe and Captain Wingenund. They were chosen his guards  because the Christian Indians were of their nation, and the Delawares,  more than any other nation, were held to have been injured and insulted  by their massacre. It was Captain Pipe who refused Girty's offer, if  Girty ever made it, and it was Captain Pipe who urged the death of the  prisoners, while treating them with mock politeness. Nine others were  brought back from the town with Knight and Crawford, and Captain Pipe  now painted all their faces black, the sign of doom. While he was  painting Knight's face, he told him that he should be taken to see  his friends at the Shawnee village, and he told Crawford that his head  should be shaved, meaning that he should be made an Indian and adopted  into the tribe. But when they came to the place where Crawford was to  suffer, Captain Pipe threw off the mask of kindness; he made a speech to  the forty warriors and seventy squaws and papooses met to torture him,  and used all his eloquence to inflame their hate.    The other Delaware chief, Captain Wingenund, had gone into his cabin,  that he might not see Crawford's death. They knew each other, and more  than once Crawford had been good to Wingenund. The captive now sent for  the chief, and Wingenund came unwillingly to speak with him, for he was  already tied to the stake, and his friend knew that he could not save  him. The chief acknowledged the kindness that they had once felt for  each other, but he said that Crawford had put it out of his power to  give him help.    [Illustration: Execution of Crawford 093]    \"How so, Captain Wingenund?\" asked Crawford.    \"By joining yourself to that execrable man, Williamson; the man who but  the other day murdered such a number of Moravian Indians, knowing them  to be friends; knowing that he ran no risk in murdering a people who  would not fight, and whose only business was praying.\"    In vain, Crawford declared that he would never have suffered the  massacre if he had been present. Wingenund was willing to believe  this, but he reminded him that the men whom he had led to Sandusky had  declared that they came to murder the remaining Moravians. No one, he  said, would now dare to speak a word for him; the king of England, if he  came with all his treasure, could not save him from the vengeance which  the Indians were going to take upon him for the slaughter of their  innocent brethren.    \"Then my fate is fixed,\" said Crawford.    Wingenund turned away weeping, and could never afterwards speak of the  scene without deep feeling.    Crawford had already undergone the first of his punishment. The savages  stripped him naked and made him sit down on the ground before the fire  kindled to burn him, and beat him with their fists and with sticks  till they had heated their rage. Then they tied his wrists together  and fastened the rope that bound them to a post strongly planted in the  ground with leash enough to let him walk round it once or twice, five or  six yards away from the fire. Girty was present, and Crawford asked if  the Indians meant to burn him; the renegade briefly answered, \"Yes.\"  Then Captain Pipe spoke, and Wingenund saw his friend for the last time.  After this chief left Crawford, the Indians broke into a loud yell and  began the work of torture which ended only with his death.    At one point he besought Simon Girty to put an end to his sufferings;  but Girty would not, or dared not.    Then Crawford began to pray, imploring God to have mercy upon him, and  bore his torment for an hour and a half longer with manly courage. It is  not known how long his torture lasted; Knight was now taken away, and no  friend remained to witness Crawford's agony to the end.    I have thought it well to recount his story, for without it we could not  fully realize what the white people of that day underwent in their long  struggle with the Ohio Indians. Cruelty so fiendish could never have  a cause, but it cannot be denied that the torture of Crawford was the  effect of the butchery of the Christian Indians. That awful deed was an  act of even greater wickedness, for it was the act of men who were not  savage by birth or race or creed. It was against the white man's law,  while the torture of Crawford was by the red man's law. It is because  of their laws that the white men have overcome and the red men have gone  under in the order of mercy, for whenever we sin against that order,  contrary to our law, or according to our law, we weaken ourselves, and  if we continue in our sin, we doom ourselves in the end to perish.          X. THE ESCAPE OF KNIGHT AND SLOVER.    When the Indians made a raid on the settlements, they abandoned even  victory if they had once had enough fighting; as when they had a feast  they glutted themselves, and then wasted what they had not eaten. They  seemed now to have had such a surfeit of cruelty in the torture of  Crawford that they took little trouble to secure Knight for a future  holiday. They promised themselves that he should be burnt, too, at the  town of the Shawnees, but in their satiety they left him unbound in the  charge of a young Indian who was to take him there from Sandusky. It is  true that Knight was very weak, and that they may have thought he was  unable to escape, though even in this case they would probably have sent  him under a stronger guard at another time, when they were not gorged  with blood.    His Indian guard was armed and was mounted on a pony, while Knight went  on foot; but Knight had made up his mind that he would escape at any  risk rather than be burned like Crawford. His face had again been  painted black; and he had Simon Girty's word, given him before Crawford  was put to death, that he was to be burned at Old Chillicothe.

Between Park's two expeditions, several travellers endeavoured to solve  some of the many problems connected with the geography of Africa.    The first person sent out by the Association was a young German,  Frederick Horneman, in the character of an Arab merchant.  He travelled  from Alexandria to Cairo, where he was imprisoned by the natives on the  news arriving of Bonaparte's landing in the country.  He was, however,  liberated by the French, and set out on the 5th of September, 1798, with  a caravan destined for Fezzan.    On one occasion, when passing through Siwah, the bigoted Mahommedan  inhabitants surrounded the caravan, having heard that two Christians  belonged to it, and promising to let it proceed provided these were  delivered up to them.  Having, however, by his knowledge of the Koran,  satisfied them that he was a true Mahommedan, being protected by the  other members of the caravan, he was allowed to proceed.    He reached Mourzouk in safety, and there endeavoured to gain information  about the states to the south of Timbuctoo.  He, however, heard but  little, though he found that Houssa was not, as supposed, a city, but a  region embracing many kingdoms, the inhabitants of which were said to be  superior in civilisation to those of the surrounding people.    He remained here for a considerable time, and then visited Tripoli,  after which he returned to Mourzouk, and started thence in April, 1800.    From that time no information was received directly from him; but Major  Denham many years afterwards learned that he had penetrated as far as  Nyffe on the Niger, where he fell a victim to disease.    Another German, Roentgen, also sent out by the Association in 1809,  started from Mogadore and, it is supposed, was murdered by his guides.    Two Americans, one a seaman, named Adams, and the other a supercargo,  James, having been wrecked on the west coast at different periods,  travelled for a considerable distance through the north-west portion of  the continent.  Adams was carried to Timbuctoo, where he remained six  months in 1810.  He found the city chiefly inhabited by negroes; and he  describes the few religious ceremonies which took place as pagan.  The  city had lately been conquered by the king of Bambarra, who had  established there a negro government.  Even the largest houses were  little more than huts, built of timber frames filled in with earth.  He  was ultimately liberated by the British consul at Mogadore.    Riley, who was wrecked in 1815, was carried as a slave through the  country.  From a caravan merchant, Sidi Hamet, who purchased him from  his first captors, he obtained much information about the country.  From  the account he received, it appears at that time that Timbuctoo was  larger and better built than Adams described it.  Sidi Hamet also  travelled a considerable distance down the banks of the Niger, which,  though at first running due east, afterwards turned to the south-east.  Travelling sixty days, he reached Wassanah, a place twice as large as  Timbuctoo, the inhabitants being hospitable and kind-hearted.  From  thence he heard that boats with cargoes of slaves sailed two months,  first south and then west, down the river, till they came to the sea,  where they met white people in vessels armed with guns.  This was the  most correct account hitherto received of the course of the Niger.  Riley was also rescued by the English consul at Mogadore.    In 1816 the English Government sent out an expedition to proceed up the  Congo, under Captain Tuckey, but he and his followers fell victims to  the climate.    At the same time another expedition had started under Major Peddie, and  Captain Campbell, but they both, with Lieutenant Stokoe, of the navy,  died the following year.    In 1821 Major Laing, starting from Sierra Leone, made a journey in  search of the source of the Niger, but was compelled to return.    In 1819 Mr Ritchie, with Lieutenant Lyon, of the navy, started from  Tripoli, intending to proceed southward to Bornou, in order to trace the  downward course of the Niger, but Mr Ritchie died, and Lieutenant Lyon  was unable to get further than the southern frontier of Fezzan.    Owing to the judicious conduct of Mr Warrington, the British Consul at  Tripoli, the English were held in high estimation at that court, and the  pacha, who was looked upon by the wild tribes of the south as the most  potent of all monarchs, assured him that any of his countrymen could  travel with perfect safety from his territories to Bornou.    The Government, therefore, considering circumstances so favourable,  organised a fresh expedition, headed by Lieutenant Clapperton and Dr  Oudney, of the Navy.  Major Denham having volunteered his services, they  were accepted, and he joined his intended companions at Tripoli.  He was  accompanied by Mr Hillman, a shipwright, who undertook to direct the  building of a vessel on the Niger.    After visiting the pacha, and having accompanied him on a hawking party  in the desert, Major Denham set out on the 5th of March, 1822, to join  his two companions, who had gone forward to the beautiful valley of  Memoom.    When near Sockna, they met a _kafila_, or caravan of slaves, in which  were about seventy negroes, who told them that they came from the  different regions of Soudan, Begharmi, and Kanem.  Those from Soudan had  regular features and a pleasing expression of countenance.    On reaching Mourzouk they were disappointed in their expectation of  receiving assistance from the sultan, who declared that it was  impossible to obtain either camels or horses before the next spring, to  enable them to proceed.  Finding this, Major Denham determined to return  to Tripoli, to represent to the pacha that something besides mere  promises must be given.    Attended by his negro servant, Barca, he reached that town on the 12th  of June, and the pacha himself showing little inclination to render  assistance, he at once started for England, to represent the state of  affairs to the Government.  He was, however, overtaken at Marseilles by  a messenger from the pacha entreating him to return, and assuring him  that he had appointed a well-known caravan leader, Boo-Khaloum, with an  escort to convey him to Bornou.    On his return to Africa he found Boo-Khaloum and part of the escort  already waiting for him at the entrance of the desert.  His new friend  delighted in pomp and show, and he and his attendants entered Sockna  attired in magnificent costumes, their chief himself riding a beautiful  Tunisian horse, the saddle and housing richly adorned with scarlet cloth  and gold.  This African caravan merchant united the character of a  warlike chief and trader, his followers being trained not only to fight  in defence of his property, but to attack towns and carry off the  hapless inhabitants as slaves.  Yet Book-Haloum was superior to most of  his age; he possessed an enlarged and liberal mind, and was considered  an honourable and humane man, while so great was his generosity that he  was adored by his people.    On the 30th of October the caravan entered Mourzouk with all the parade  and pomp they could muster.  Boo-Khaloum's liberality had made him so  popular that a large portion of the inhabitants of the town came out to  welcome him.    Major Denham was greatly disappointed at not seeing his friends among  the crowd.  He found that Dr Oudney was suffering from a complaint in  his chest, and that Clapperton was confined to his bed; indeed the  climate of Mourzouk is evidently very unhealthy.    The arrangements for starting were not completed until the 29th of  November.  In the meantime the other members of the expedition had  somewhat recovered.  Major Denham had engaged a native of the Island of  Saint Vincent, of the name of Simpkins, but who, having traversed half  the world over, had acquired that of Columbus.  He spoke Arabic  perfectly, and three European languages.  Three negroes were also hired,  and a Gibraltar Jew, Jacob, who acted as store-keeper.  These, with four  men to look after their camels, Mr Hillman and themselves, made up  their household to thirteen persons.  Several merchants also joined  their party.  Besides these, the caravan comprised one hundred and ten  Arabs, marshalled in tens and twenties under their different chiefs.    The Arabs in the service of the pacha, who were to escort them to  Bornou, behaved admirably, and enlivened them greatly on their dreary  desert road by their wit and sagacity, as well as by their poetry,  extemporary and traditional.    The camels and tents having been sent on before, the party started on  horseback on the evening of the day mentioned.  Dr Oudney was suffering  from his cough, and neither Clapperton nor Hillman had got over their  ague, a bad condition in which to commence their arduous journey.    The heat when crossing the desert was great; not a bird nor an insect  was to be seen moving through the air; but the nights were beautiful and  perfectly still, gentle breezes cooling the air.  By digging a few  inches into the hot, loose soil, a cool and soft bed was obtained.  Through wide districts the surface was covered with salt, and from the  sides of hollows where it was broken, hung beautiful crystals like the  finest frost-work.    Before proceeding far, objects sufficient to create the deepest horror  in their minds were met with.  In all directions the ground was covered  with the skeletons of those who had perished in attempting to"]]]
