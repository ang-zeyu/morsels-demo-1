(#12)"],[1,"which  fortune had put into his hands: the king of France sent a body of six  thousand men to oppose him: subsidies were not regularly remitted him  from England; and many of his troops deserted for want of pay: the  elector of Brandenburgh threatened him with an invasion in his own  state; and on the whole, he was glad to conclude a peace under the  mediation of France. On the first surmise of his intentions, Sir  William Temple was sent from London with money to fix him in his former  alliance; but found that he arrived too late.    The Dutch, encouraged by all these favorable circumstances, continued  resolute to exert themselves to the utmost in their own defence. De  Ruyter, their great admiral, was arrived from his expedition to Guinea:  their Indian fleet was come home in safety: their harbors were crowded  with merchant ships: faction at home was appeased: the young prince of  Orange had put himself under the tuition of the states of Holland,  and of De Wit, their pensionary, who executed his trust with honor and  fidelity; and the animosity which the Hollanders entertained against  the attack of the English, so unprovoked, as they thought it, made  them thirst for revenge, and hope for better success in their next  enterprise. Such vigor was exerted in the common cause, that, in order  to man the fleet, all merchant ships were prohibited to sail, and even  the fisheries were suspended.[*]         * Tromp's Life. D'Estrades February 5, 1665.    The English likewise continued in the same disposition, though another  more grievous calamity had joined itself to that of war. The plague had  broken out in London; and that with such violence as to cut off, in a  year, near ninety thousand inhabitants. The king was obliged to summon  the Parliament at Oxford.    A good agreement still subsisted between the king and parliament. They,  on their part, unanimously voted him the supply demanded, twelve  hundred and fifty thousand pounds, to be levied in two years by monthly  assessments. And he, to gratify them, passed the five-mile act, which  has given occasion to grievous and not unjust complaints. The church,  under pretence of guarding monarchy against its inveterate enemies,  persevered in the project of wreaking her own enmity against the  nonconformists. It was enacted, that no dissenting teacher, who took not  the nonresistance oath above mentioned, should, except upon the road,  come within five miles of any corporation, or of any place, where he  had preached after the act of oblivion. The penalty was a fine of fifty  pounds, and six months' imprisonment. By ejecting the nonconforming  clergy from their churches, and prohibiting all separate congregations,  they had been rendered incapable of gaining any livelihood by their  spiritual profession. And now, under color of removing them from places  where their influence might be dangerous, an expedient was fallen upon  to deprive them of all means of subsistence. Had not the spirit of the  nation undergone a change, these violences were preludes to the most  furious persecution.    However prevalent the hierarchy, this law did not pass without  opposition. Besides several peers, attached to the old parliamentary  party, Southampton himself, though Clarendon's great friend, expressed  his disapprobation of these measures. But the church party, not  discouraged with this opposition, introduced into the house of commons a  bill for imposing the oath of nonresistance on the whole nation. It was  rejected only by three voices. The parliament, after a short session,  was prorogued.    {1666.} After France had declared war, England was evidently overmatched  in force. Yet she possessed this advantage by her situation, that she  lay between the fleets of her enemies, and might be able, by speedy and  well-concerted operations, to prevent their junction. But such was the  unhappy conduct of her commanders, or such the want of intelligence in  her ministers, that this circumstance turned rather to her prejudice.  Lewis had given orders to the duke of Beaufort, his admiral, to sail  from Toulon; and the French squadron under his command, consisting  of above forty sail,[*] was now commonly supposed to be entering the  Channel.         * D'Estrades, May 21, 1666.    The Dutch fleet, to the number of seventy-six sail, was at sea, under  the command of De Ruyter and Tromp, in order to join him. The duke of  Albemarle and Prince Rupert commanded the English fleet, which exceeded  not seventy-four sail. Albemarle, who, from his successes under the  protector, had too much learned to despise the enemy, proposed to  detach Prince Rupert with twenty ships, in order to oppose the duke  of Beaufort. Sir George Ayscue, well acquainted with the bravery and  conduct of De Ruyter, protested against the temerity of this resolution:  but Albemarle's authority prevailed. The remainder of the English set  sail to give battle to the Dutch; who, seeing the enemy advance quickly  upon them, cut their cables, and prepared for the combat. The battle  that ensued is one of the most memorable that we read of in story;  whether we consider its long duration, or the desperate courage with  which it was fought. Albemarle made here some atonement by his valor for  the rashness of the attempt. No youth, animated by glory and ambitious  hopes, could exert himself more than did this man, who was now in the  decline of life, and who had reached the summit of honors. We shall not  enter minutely into particulars. It will be sufficient to mention the  chief events of each day's engagement.    In the first day, Sir William Berkeley, vice-admiral, leading the van,  fell into the thickest of the enemy, was overpowered, and his ship  taken. He himself was found dead in his cabin, all covered with blood.  The English had the weather-gage of the enemy; but as the wind blew so  hard that they could not use their lower tier, they derived but small  advantage from this circumstance. The Dutch shot, however, fell chiefly  on their sails and rigging; and few ships were sunk or much damaged.  Chain-shot was at that time a new invention; commonly attributed to De  Wit. Sir John Harman exerted himself extremely on this day. The Dutch  admiral, Evertz, was killed in engaging him. Darkness parted the  combatants.    The second day, the wind was somewhat fallen, and the combat became more  steady and more terrible. The English now found, that the greatest valor  cannot compensate the superiority of numbers, against an enemy who is  well conducted, and who is not defective in courage. De Ruyter and Van  Tromp, rivals in glory and enemies from faction, exerted themselves in  emulation of each other; and De Ruyter had the advantage of disengaging  and saving his antagonist, who had been surrounded by the English, and  was in the most imminent danger. Sixteen fresh ships joined the Dutch  fleet during the action: and the English were so shattered, that their  fighting ships were reduced to twenty-eight, and they found themselves  obliged to retreat towards their own coast. The Dutch followed them,  and were on the point of renewing the combat; when a calm, which came a  little before night, prevented the engagement.    Next morning, the English were obliged to continue their retreat; and a  proper disposition was made for that purpose. The shattered ships were  ordered to stretch ahead; and sixteen of the most entire followed them  in good order, and kept the enemy in awe. Albemarle himself closed the  rear, and presented an undaunted countenance to his victorious foes.  The earl of Ossory, son of Ormond, a gallant youth, who sought honor  and experience in every action throughout Europe, was then on board the  admiral. Albemarle confessed to him his intention rather to blow up his  ship and perish gloriously, than yield to the enemy. Ossory applauded  this desperate resolution.    About two o'clock, the Dutch had come up with their enemy, and were  ready to renew the fight; when a new fleet was descried from the  south, crowding all their sail to reach the scene of action. The Dutch  flattered themselves that Beaufort was arrived to cut off the retreat of  the vanquished: the English hoped, that Prince Rupert had come, to turn  the scale of action. Albemarle, who had received intelligence of the  prince's approach, bent his course towards him. Unhappily, Sir George  Ayscue, in a ship of a hundred guns, the largest in the fleet, struck  on the Galloper sands, and could receive no assistance from his friends,  who were hastening to join the reenforcement. He could not even reap  the consolation of perishing with honor, and revenging his death on his  enemies. They were preparing fireships to attack him, and he was obliged  to strike. The English sailors, seeing the necessity, with the utmost  indignation surrendered themselves prisoners.    Albemarle and Prince Rupert were now determined to face the enemy; and  next morning, the battle began afresh, with more equal force than ever,  and with equal valor. After long cannonading, the fleets came to a close  combat; which was continued with great violence, till parted by a mist.  The English retired first into their harbors.    Though the English, by their obstinate courage, reaped the chief honor  in this engagement it is somewhat uncertain who obtained the victory.  The Hollanders took a few ships; and having some appearances of  advantage, expressed their satisfaction by all the signs of triumph and  rejoicing. But as the English fleet was repaired in a little time, and  put to sea more formidable than ever, together with many of those ships  which the Dutch had boasted to have burned or destroyed, all Europe saw,  that those two brave nations were engaged in a contest which was not  likely, on either side, to prove decisive.    It was the conjunction alone of the French, that could give a decisive  superiority to the Dutch. In order to facilitate this conjunction, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19217"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.II. (#12)"],[1,"William lands in Ireland.....

Though the affairs of Ireland were extremely pressing, and the  protestants of that country had made repeated application for relief,  the succours were retarded either by disputes among the ministers, or  the neglect of those who had the management of the expedition, in such  a manner that king James had been six months in Ireland before the army  was embarked for that kingdom. At length eighteen regiments of infantry,  and five of dragoons, being raised for that service, a train of  artillery provided, and transports prepared, the duke of Sehomberg, on  whom king William had conferred the chief command of this armament,  set out for Chester, after he had in person thanked the commons for the  uncommon regard they had paid to his services, and received assurances  from the house, that they would pay particular attention to him and his  army. On the thirteenth day of August he landed in the neighbourhood  of Carrickfergus with about ten thousand foot and dragoons, and took  possession of Belfast, from whence the enemy retired at his approach  to Carrickfergus, where they resolved to make a stand. The duke having  refreshed his men, marched thither, and invested the place; the siege  was carried on till the twenty-sixth clay of the month, when the  breaches being practicable, the besieged capitulated, on condition of  marching out with their arms, and as much baggage as they could carry on  their backs; and of their being conducted to the next Irish garrison,  which was at Newry. During this siege the duke was joined by the rest of  his army from England; but he had left orders for conveying the greater  part of the artillery and stores from Chester directly to Carlingford.  He now began his march through Lisburne and Hillsborough, and encamped  at Drummore, where the protestants of the north had been lately routed  by Hamilton; thence he proceeded to Loughbrillane, where he was joined  by the horse and dragoons of Inniskilling. Then the enemy abandoned  Newry and Dundalk, in the neighbourhood of which Sehomberg encamped on a  low damp ground, having the town and river on the south, and surrounded  on every other part by hills, bogs, and mountains.          THE INNISKILLINERS OBTAIN A VICTORY.    His army, consisting chiefly of new-raised men little inured to  hardship, began to flag under the fatigue of marching, the inclemency of  the weather, and scarcity of provisions. Here he was reinforced by the  regiments of Kirke, Hanmer, and Stuart; and would have continued his  march to Drogheda, where he understood Rosene lay with about twenty  thousand men, had he not been obliged to wait for the artillery, which  was not yet arrived at Carlingford. King James, having assembled all  his forces, advanced towards Schomberg, and appeared before his  intrenchments in order of battle; but the duke, knowing they were  greatly superior in number of horse, and that his own army was  undisciplined, and weakened by death and sickness, restrained his men  within the lines, and in a little time the enemy retreated. Immediately  after their departure, a conspiracy was discovered in the English camp,  hatched by some French papists, who had insinuated themselves into  the protestant regiments. One of these, whose name was Du Plessis, had  written a letter to the ambassador D'Avaux, promising to desert with  all the papists of the three French regiments in Schomberg's army. This  letter being found, Du Plessis and five accomplices were tried by a  court-martial, and executed. About two hundred and fifty papists being  discovered in the French regiments, they were sent over to England,  from thence to Holland. While Schomberg remained in this situation, the  Inniskilliners made excursions in the neighbourhood, under the command  of colonel Lloyd; and on the twenty-seventh day of September they  obtained a complete victory over five times their number of the Irish.  They killed seven hundred on the spot, and took O'Kelly their commander,  with about fifty officers, and a considerable booty of cattle. The duke  was so pleased with their behaviour on this occasion, that they received  a very honourable testimony of his approbation.          SCHOMBERG CENSURED.    Meanwhile, the enemy took possession of James-Town, and reduced Sligo,  one of the forts of which was gallantly defended by St. Sauver, a  French captain, and his company of grenadiers, until he was obliged  to capitulate for want of water and provisions. A contagious distemper  still continued to rage in Schomberg's camp, and swept off a great  number of officers and soldiers; so that in the beginning of next  spring, not above half the number of those who went over with the  general remained alive. He was censured for his inactivity, and the  king, in repeated letters, desired him to hazard an engagement, provided  any opportunity should occur; but he did not think proper to run the  risk of a battle, against an enemy that was above thrice his number,  well disciplined, healthy, and conducted by able officers. Nevertheless,  he was certainly blameable for having chosen such an unwholesome  situation. At the approach of winter he retired into quarters, in hopes  of being reinforced with seven thousand Danes, who had already arrived  in Britain. These auxiliaries were stipulated in a treaty which William  had just concluded with the king of Denmark. The English were not more  successful at sea than they had proved in their operations by land.  Admiral Herbert, now created earl of Torrington, having sailed to  Ireland with the combined squadrons of England and Holland, made a  fruitless attempt upon Cork, and lost a great number of seamen by  sickness, which was imputed to bad provisions. The Dartmouth ship of war  fell into the hands of the enemy, who infested the channel with such  a number of armed ships and privateers, that the trade of England  sustained incredible damage.          THE FRENCH WORSTED AT WALCOURT.    The affairs of France wore but a gloomy aspect on the continent, where  all the powers of Europe seemed to have conspired her destruction. King  William had engaged in a new league with the states-general, in which  former treaties of peace and commerce were confirmed. It was stipulated,  that in case the king of Great Britain should be attacked, the Dutch  should assist him with six thousand infantry, and twenty ships of the  line; and that, provided hostilities should be committed against the  states-general, England should supply them with ten thousand infantry,  and twenty ships of war. This treaty was no sooner ratified, than king  William dispatched the lord Churchill, whom he had by this time created  earl of Marlborough, to Holland, in order to command the British  auxiliaries in that service to the number of eleven thousand, the  greater part of which had been in the army of king James when the prince  of Orange landed in England. The earl forthwith joined the Dutch army,  under the command of prince Waldeck, who had fixed his rendezvous in the  county of Liege, with a view to act against the French army commanded by  the mareschal D'Humieres; while the prince of Vaudemont headed a little  army of observation, consisting of Spaniards, Dutch, and Germans, to  watch the motions of Calvo in another part of the Low-Countries. The  city of Liege was compelled to renounce the neutrality, and declare for  the allies. Mareschal D'Humieres attacked the foragers belonging to the  army of the states at Walcourt, in the month of August; an obstinate  engagement ensued, and the French were obliged to retreat in confusion,  with the loss of two thousand men, and some pieces of artillery. The  army of observation levelled part of the French lines on the side of  Courtray, and raised contributions on the territories of the enemy.          SUCCESS OF THE CONFEDERATES IN GERMANY.    The French were almost entire masters of the three ecclesiastical  electorates of Germany. They possessed Mentz, Triers, Bonne,  Keiserswaert, Philipsburgh, and Landau. They had blown up the castle of  Heildelberg, in the Palatinate, and destroyed Manheim. They had reduced  Worms and Spiers to ashes; and demolished Frankendahl, together  with several other fortresses. These conquests, the fruits of sudden  invasion, were covered with a numerous army, commanded by the mareschal  de Duras; and all his inferior generals were officers of distinguished  courage and ability. Nevertheless, he found it difficult to maintain  his ground against the different princes of the empire. The duke of  Lorraine, who commanded the imperial troops, invested Mentz, and took  it by capitulation; the elector of Brandenburgh, having reduced"]]]
