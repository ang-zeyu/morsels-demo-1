What  those particular interests were which required to be protected by so  jealous and anomalous a doctrine does not appear to be anywhere  specified with precision. But nothing is more certain than that  confusion and chaos must be the inevitable outcome of any attempt to  reduce to practice such opposite principles as are involved in  Representative Government and Executive irresponsibility. Such an  attempt in England would very soon produce revolution. Such an attempt  in France did actually produce revolution in 1830, when Charles the  Tenth was deposed for his persistent endeavours to maintain an unpopular  ministry in power. No country in the world would long continue to  tolerate a Parliamentary system which was free and representative in  theory, but tyrannous and despotic in practice. Upper Canada was indeed  long-suffering, but a time arrived when it became evident that there was  a limit to her powers of endurance.    As the years rolled by, and the country steadily advanced in wealth and  population, abuses grew apace.[30] The Executive became rapacious and  tyrannical. Commanding, as they did, the entire administrative and  official influence of the Province, they ordered all things according to  their own pleasure. They could count upon the support of every member of  the Legislative Council. Indeed, through their pliant tool, the  Lieutenant-Governor for the time being, they controlled the membership  of the latter body, and took care that no man was appointed a  Legislative Councillor unless he was either one of themselves or wholly  subject to their influence. The Assembly soon found that it was  deliberately and systematically deprived of the privileges which of  right belonged to it, and that it was little better than a nullity. It  might meet and go through the form of passing such measures as it saw  fit, but if the measures so passed were not acceptable to the  Legislative and Executive Councils they were contumeliously vetoed when  they reached the Upper House. This brought the two deliberative branches  of the Legislature into direct and perpetual conflict. The Assembly,  however, in early years, was always largely made up of such men as Isaac  Swayze--subservient creatures of the Administration, who opposed their  influence to that of the tribunes of the people, and prevented any  collision between the two Houses from assuming a very serious  constitutional aspect. It was not till the third decade of the century  that the conflict assumed such a character as to threaten the  foundations of the constitution itself; and it was not till the fourth  decade that any actual attempt was made to subvert those foundations.    The Province was about fifteen years old before the inhabitants of Upper  Canada generally began to realize what an intolerable burden they had to  bear in this irresponsible Executive. Before that time some of the  better educated and more intelligent among them recognized its existence  as an evil with which they or their descendants would at some future  time be called upon to deal. But such persons were comparatively few in  number, and as the burden did not lie with special heaviness upon their  own backs, they did not feel called upon to involve themselves in what  might prove a ruinous quarrel with persons who would not tamely submit  to interference. As for the inhabitants generally, they were too busily  occupied in clearing their lands, in hewing out homes for themselves and  their families in the vast wilderness, and in reducing the soil to a  state fit for cultivation, to give themselves much concern about public  affairs. There was no newspaper press to stimulate them to enquiry. The  only sheet published in the Province which by any license of language  could be called a regular newspaper was _The Upper Canada Gazette_,  which was the official mouthpiece of the Administration. _The Canada  Constellation_, which was a quaint long folio, published at the old  capital, Niagara, had but a brief existence, and expired during the  very early years of the century. The _Upper Canada Guardian_, to be  hereafter referred to, did not come into being till 1807. Editorial  articles, except of the briefest and crudest sort, were a still later  development. The bucolic mind had no intellectual stimulant whatever  except such as was to be obtained from contact with other bucolic minds  through the medium of conversation. It was no wonder, then, that for the  first fifteen years after the creation of Upper Canada, the Provincial  Government should have been permitted to do very much as it chose,  without being subjected to any formidable criticism on the part of the  community.    The Legislative Council, as has been said, was composed of members  nominated by the Sovereign's representative. By the sixth section of the  Constitutional Act provision had been made for the creation of a  hereditary nobility, with the hereditary right of being summoned to the  Legislative Council. Happily this authority was not exercised;  otherwise, as Gourlay has remarked, \"we should have seen, perhaps, the  Duke of Ontario leading in a cart of hay, my Lord Erie pitching, and Sir  Peter Superior making the rick; or perhaps his Grace might now have been  figuring as a pettifogging lawyer, his Lordship as a pedlar, and Sir  Knight, as a poor parson, starving on five thousand acres of Clergy  Reserves.\"[31] We were spared the spectacle of such absurdities, and  life members of the Legislative Council were the nearest approach to a  nobility vouchsafed to us. Some of the first appointees were men of  intelligence and probity, but few of those subsequently created could  with any show of truthfulness be so characterized. They were for the  most part dependants of the Government, with no fitness, educational or  otherwise, for the discharge of grave legislative functions, and with no  motive but to do the bidding of those who had clothed them with the  dignity of office. All things considered, this condition of things was  to be looked for; but the inevitable result followed. The few upright  members either died off in the course of time, and were succeeded by  sycophantic placemen, or, finding themselves outnumbered, ceased to  attend the sittings of the branch of the Legislature to which they  belonged. In one way and another, those who really wished to preserve  the public interests were weeded out, and nothing was left but a rump  devoted to the Executive will. Instead of answering the purpose for  which it was originally intended, the Legislative Council became a mere  instrument in the hands of the oligarchy for stemming back the tide of  public opinion. Instead of forming a seasonable and wholesome check upon  extravagance and inconsiderate legislation in the Lower House, it  contributed to the impoverishment of the Provincial revenue by assisting  to keep the control of public affairs in the hands of selfish and  unprincipled men. Instead of preserving the \"happy balance of our  glorious Constitution\"--a phrase constantly placed in the mouths of  Lieutenant-Governors, and embodied in their addresses to our Canadian  simulacrum of the House of Lords--it tended to keep the balance all on  one side, and that side was the one most prejudicial to the public good.  It became a mere stop-gap interposed by the Government between itself  and the Assembly. The Assembly passed measure after measure with careful  deliberation, only to find that their time had been thrown away, for  upon reaching the Upper House these measures were ignominously thrust  aside. One who had himself been a member of the Assembly, and who had  had personal experience of the evils whereof he wrote, has left the  following description of the manner in which Bills from the Lower  Chamber were treated in the Upper: \"Sitting for a short time each day,  the Bills of the Assembly are despatched under the table with unexampled  celerity. Deputations, conveying up popular measures, no sooner have  their backs turned than the process of strangulation commences. Bills  that have undergone discussion for days in the other House, and that  have been amended and perfected with the greatest care, no sooner arrive  in their august presence than their fate is sealed.\"[32] He adds: \"Of  those who attend to their duties, two-thirds are dependent on the  Government for either salaries or pensions. It is not harsh to say that  they become the willing tools of the hand that feeds them, instead of  looking to the interests of those from whom they indirectly derive their  support. Such gratitude may be very amiable, but it is no qualification  for an independent legislator.\"[33] These lines were written as late as  the year 1837, and their author informs us that within the preceding  eight years the Council had rejected no fewer than three hundred and  twenty-five Bills passed by the Assembly, being an average of more than  forty for each session[34]--a statement which is fully confirmed by  reference to the official journals of the respective Houses.    Such a method of procedure, leading to inevitable conflicts between the  two Houses, caused the public business to be impeded and the public  interests to be very inefficiently conserved. The whole administrative  system of the Province was disorganized. The contest was very unequal,  for the Government could frequently command a majority of votes in the  Assembly. The minority in that House smarted under a sense of tyranny  and injustice, and felt that they were of no weight in the body politic.  That sense of dignity which is imparted by a consciousness of  contributing to the formation of public policy and opinion was wanting.  Not only were the benefits arising from a proper organization of labour  altogether lost, but the antagonism between the two factors in political  life was so great that"]]]
