ORDER OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.--Nature has set the order in  which the powers of the nervous system shall develop. And we must follow  this order if we would obtain the best results. Stated in technical  terms, the order is _from fundamental to accessory_. This is to say that  the nerve centers controlling the larger and more general movements of  the body ripen first, and those governing the finer motor adjustments  later. For example, the larger body muscles of the child which are  concerned with sitting up come under control earlier than those  connected with walking. The arm muscles develop control earlier than the  finger muscles, and the head and neck muscles earlier than the eye  muscles. So also the more general and less highly specialized powers of  the mind ripen sooner than the more highly specialized. Perception and  observation precede powers of critical judgment and association. Memory  and imagination ripen earlier than reasoning and the logical ability.    This all means that our educational system must be planned to follow the  order of nature. Children of the primary grades should not be required  to write with fine pencils or pens which demand delicate finger  adjustments, since the brain centers for these finer cooerdinations are  not yet developed. Young children should not be set at work  necessitating difficult eye control, such as stitching through  perforated cardboard, reading fine print and the like, as their eyes  are not yet ready for such tasks. The more difficult analytical problems  of arithmetic and relations of grammar should not be required of pupils  at a time when the association areas of the brain are not yet ready for  this type of thinking. For such methods violate the law of nature, and  the child is sure to suffer the penalty.      4. IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH AND VIGOR OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM    Parallel with opportunities for proper stimuli and response the nervous  system must possess good _tonicity_, or vigor. This depends in large  degree on general health and nutrition, with freedom from overfatigue.  No favorableness of environment nor excellence of training can result in  an efficient brain if the nerve energy has run low from depleted health,  want of proper nourishment, or exhaustion.    THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE.--Histologists find that the nuclei of nerve  cells are shrunk as much as fifty per cent by extreme fatigue.  Reasonable fatigue followed by proper recuperation is not harmful, but  even necessary if the best development is to be attained; but fatigue  without proper nourishment and rest is fatal to all mental operations,  and indeed finally to the nervous system itself, leaving it permanently  in a condition of low tone, and incapable of rallying to strong effort.  For rapid and complete recuperation the cells must have not only the  best of nourishment but opportunity for rest as well.    Extreme and long-continued fatigue is hostile to the development and  welfare of any nervous system, and especially to that of children. Not  only does overfatigue hinder growth, but it also results in the  formation of certain _toxins_, or poisons, in the organism, which are  particularly harmful to nervous tissue. It is these fatigue toxins that  account for many of the nervous and mental disorders which accompany  breakdowns from overwork. On the whole, the evil effects from mental  overstrain are more to be feared than from physical overstrain.    THE EFFECTS OF WORRY.--There is, perhaps, no greater foe to brain growth  and efficiency than the nervous and worn-out condition which comes from  loss of sleep or from worry. Experiments in the psychological  laboratories have shown that nerve cells shrivel up and lose their  vitality under loss of sleep. Let this go on for any considerable  length of time, and the loss is irreparable; for the cells can never  recuperate. This is especially true in the case of children or young  people. Many school boys and girls, indeed many college students, are  making slow progress in their studies not because they are mentally slow  or inefficient, not even chiefly because they lose time that should be  put on their lessons, but because they are incapacitating their brains  for good service through late hours and the consequent loss of sleep.  Add to this condition that of worry, which often accompanies it from the  fact of failure in lessons, and a naturally good and well-organized  nervous system is sure to fail. Worry, from whatever cause, should be  avoided as one would avoid poison, if we would bring ourselves to the  highest degree of efficiency. Not only does worry temporarily unfit the  mind for its best work, but its evil results are permanent, since the  mind is left with a poorly developed or undone nervous system through  which to work, even after the cause for worry has been removed and the  worry itself has ceased.    Not only should each individual seek to control the causes of worry in  his own life, but the home and the school should force upon childhood as  few causes for worry as may be. Children's worry over fears of the dark,  over sickness and death, over prospective but delayed punishment, over  the thousand and one real or imaginary troubles of childhood, should be  eliminated so far as possible. School examinations that prey on the  peace of mind, threats of failure of promotion, all nagging and sarcasm,  and whatever else may cause continued pain or worry to sensitive minds  should be barred from our schoolroom methods and practice. The price we  force the child to pay for results through their use is too great for  them to be tolerated. We must seek a better way.    THE FACTORS IN GOOD NUTRITION.--For the best nutrition there is  necessity first of all plenty of nourishing and healthful food. Science  and experience have both disproved the supposition that students should  be scantily fed. O'Shea claims that many brain workers are far short of  their highest grade of efficiency because of starving their brains from  poor diet. And not only must the food be of the right quality, but the  body must be in good health. Little good to eat the best of food unless  it is being properly digested and assimilated. And little good if all  the rest is as it should be, and the right amount of oxidation does not  go on in the brain so as to remove the worn-out cells and make place for  new ones. This warns us that pure air and a strong circulation are  indispensable to the best working of our brains. No doubt many students  who find their work too hard for them might locate the trouble in their  stomachs or their lungs or the food they eat, rather than in their  minds.      5. PROBLEMS FOR INTROSPECTION AND OBSERVATION    1. Estimate the mental progress made by the child during the first five  years and compare with that made during the second five years of its  life. To do this make a list, so far as you are able, of the  acquisitions of each period. What do you conclude as to the importance  of play and freedom in early education? Why not continue this method  instead of sending the child to school?    2. Which has the better opportunity for sensory training, the city child  or the country child? For social training? For motor development through  play? It is said by specialists that country children are not as good  players as city children. Why should this be the case?    3. Observe carefully some group of children for evidences of lack of  sensory training (Interest in sensory objects, skill in observation,  etc.). For lack of motor training (Failure in motor control,  awkwardness, lack of skill in play, etc.). Do you find that general  mental ability seems to be correlated with sensory and motor ability, or  not?    4. What sensory training can be had from (1) geography, (2) agriculture,  (3) arithmetic, (4) drawing? What lines of motor training ought the  school to afford, (1) in general, (2) for the hand, (3) in the grace and  poise of carriage or bearing, (4) in any other line? Make observation  tests of these points in one or more school rooms and report the  results.    5. Describe what you think must be the type of mental life of Helen  Keller. (Read \"The World I Live In,\" by Helen Keller.)    6. Study groups of children for signs of deficiency in brain power from  lack of nutrition. From fatigue. From worry. From lack of sleep.          CHAPTER V    HABIT      Habit is our \"best friend or worst enemy.\" We are \"walking bundles of  habits.\" Habit is the \"fly-wheel of society,\" keeping men patient and  docile in the hard or disagreeable lot which some must fill. Habit is a  \"cable which we cannot break.\" So say the wise men. Let me know your  habits of life and you have revealed your moral standards and conduct.  Let me discover your intellectual habits, and I understand your type of  mind and methods of thought. In short, our lives are largely a daily  round of activities dictated by our habits in this line or that. Most of  our movements and acts are habitual; we think as we have formed the  habit of thinking; we decide as we are in the habit of deciding; we  sleep, or eat, or speak as we have grown into the habit of doing these  things; we may even say our prayers or perform other religious exercises  as matters of habit. But while habit is the veriest tyrant, yet its good  offices far exceed the bad even in the most fruitless or depraved life.      1. THE NATURE OF HABIT    Many people when they speak or think of habit give the term a very  narrow or limited meaning. They have in mind only certain moral or  personal tendencies usually spoken of as one's \"habits.\" But in order to  understand habit in any thorough and complete way we must, as suggested  by the preceding paragraph, broaden our concept to include every  possible line of physical and mental activity. Habit may be defined as  _the tendency of the nervous system to repeat any act that has been  performed once or many"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20239"],[0,"The Ten Books on Architecture (#12)"],[1,"some hard stone, and, as though building with  brick, they bind the upright joints by interchanging the direction of  the stones as they lie in the courses. Thus they attain to a perfection  that will endure to eternity. These structures are of two kinds. One of  them is called \"isodomum,\" the other \"pseudisodomum.\"    6. A wall is called isodomum when all the courses are of equal height;  pseudisodomum, when the rows of courses do not match but run unequally.  Both kinds are strong: first, because the rubble itself is of close  texture and solid, unable to suck the moisture out of the mortar, but  keeping it in its moist condition for a very long period; secondly,  because the beds of the stones, being laid smooth and level to begin  with, keep the mortar from falling, and, as they are bonded throughout  the entire thickness of the wall, they hold together for a very long  period.    7. Another method is that which they call [Greek: emplekton], used also  among us in the country. In this the facings are finished, but the other  stones left in their natural state and then laid with alternate bonding  stones. But our workmen, in their hurry to finish, devote themselves  only to the facings of the walls, setting them upright but filling the  space between with a lot of broken stones and mortar thrown in anyhow.  This makes three different sections in the same structure; two  consisting of facing and one of filling between them. The Greeks,  however, do not build so; but laying their stones level and building  every other stone length-wise into the thickness, they do not fill the  space between, but construct the thickness of their walls in one solid  and unbroken mass from the facings to the interior. Further, at  intervals they lay single stones which run through the entire  thickness of the wall. These stones, which show at each end, are called  [Greek: diatonoi], and by their bonding powers they add very greatly to  the solidity of the walls.    [Illustration: Photo. Moscioni    OPUS RETICULATUM FROM THE THERMAE OF HADRIAN'S VILLA AT TIVOLI]    [Illustration: Photo. Moscioni    EXAMPLE OF OPUS RETICULATUM FROM THE DOORWAY OF THE STOA POECILE. VILLA  OF HADRIAN AT TIVOLI]    8. One who in accordance with these notes will take pains in selecting  his method of construction, may count upon having something that will  last. No walls made of rubble and finished with delicate beauty--no such  walls can escape ruin as time goes on. Hence, when arbitrators are  chosen to set a valuation on party walls, they do not value them at what  they cost to build, but look up the written contract in each case and  then, after deducting from the cost one eightieth for each year that the  wall has been standing, decide that the remainder is the sum to be paid.  They thus in effect pronounce that such walls cannot last more than  eighty years.    9. In the case of brick walls, however, no deduction is made provided  that they are still standing plumb, but they are always valued at what  they cost to build. Hence in some states we may see public buildings and  private houses, as well as those of kings, built of brick: in Athens,  for example, the part of the wall which faces Mt. Hymettus and  Pentelicus; at Patras, the cellae of the temple of Jupiter and Hercules,  which are brick, although on the outside the entablature and columns of  the temple are of stone; in Italy, at Arezzo, an ancient wall  excellently built; at Tralles, the house built for the kings of the  dynasty of Attalus, which is now always granted to the man who holds the  state priesthood. In Sparta, paintings have been taken out of certain  walls by cutting through the bricks, then have been placed in wooden  frames, and so brought to the Comitium to adorn the aedileship of Varro  and Murena.    10. Then there is the house of Croesus which the people of Sardis have  set apart as a place of repose for their fellow-citizens in the  retirement of age,--a \"Gerousia\" for the guild of the elder men. At  Halicarnassus, the house of that most potent king Mausolus, though  decorated throughout with Proconnesian marble, has walls built of brick  which are to this day of extraordinary strength, and are covered with  stucco so highly polished that they seem to be as glistening as glass.  That king did not use brick from poverty; for he was choke-full of  revenues, being ruler of all Caria.    11. As for his skill and ingenuity as a builder, they may be seen from  what follows. He was born at Melassa, but recognizing the natural  advantages of Halicarnassus as a fortress, and seeing that it was  suitable as a trading centre and that it had a good harbour, he fixed  his residence there. The place had a curvature like that of the seats in  a theatre. On the lowest tier, along the harbour, was built the forum.  About halfway up the curving slope, at the point where the curved  cross-aisle is in a theatre, a broad wide street was laid out, in the  middle of which was built the Mausoleum, a work so remarkable that it is  classed among the Seven Wonders of the World. At the top of the hill, in  the centre, is the fane of Mars, containing a colossal acrolithic statue  by the famous hand of Leochares. That is, some think that this statue is  by Leochares, others by Timotheus. At the extreme right of the summit is  the fane of Venus and Mercury, close to the spring of Salmacis.    12. There is a mistaken idea that this spring infects those who drink of  it with an unnatural lewdness. It will not be out of place to explain  how this idea came to spread throughout the world from a mistake in the  telling of the tale. It cannot be that the water makes men effeminate  and unchaste, as it is said to do; for the spring is of remarkable  clearness and excellent in flavour. The fact is that when Melas and  Arevanias came there from Argos and Troezen and founded a colony  together, they drove out the Carians and Lelegans who were barbarians.  These took refuge in the mountains, and, uniting there, used to make  raids, plundering the Greeks and laying their country waste in a cruel  manner. Later, one of the colonists, to make money, set up a  well-stocked shop, near the spring because the water was so good, and  the way in which he carried it on attracted the barbarians. So they  began to come down, one at a time, and to meet with society, and thus  they were brought back of their own accord, giving up their rough and  savage ways for the delights of Greek customs. Hence this water acquired  its peculiar reputation, not because it really induced unchastity, but  because those barbarians were softened by the charm of civilization.    [Illustration: THE MAUSOLEUM AT HALICARNASSUS AS RESTORED BY FRIEDRICH  ADLER]    13. But since I have been tempted into giving a description of this  fortified place, it remains to finish my account of it. Corresponding to  the fane of Venus and the spring described above, which are on the  right, we have on the extreme left the royal palace which king Mausolus  built there in accordance with a plan all his own. To the right it  commands a view of the forum, the harbour, and the entire line of  fortifications, while just below it, to the left, there is a concealed  harbour, hidden under the walls in such a way that nobody could see or  know what was going on in it. Only the king himself could, in case of  need, give orders from his own palace to the oarsmen and soldiers,  without the knowledge of anybody else.    14. After the death of Mausolus, his wife Artemisia became queen, and  the Rhodians, regarding it as an outrage that a woman should be ruler of  the states of all Caria, fitted out a fleet and sallied forth to seize  upon the kingdom. When news of this reached Artemisia, she gave orders  that her fleet should be hidden away in that harbour with oarsmen and  marines mustered and concealed, but that the rest of the citizens should  take their places on the city wall. After the Rhodians had landed at the  larger harbour with their well-equipped fleet, she ordered the people on  the wall to cheer them and to promise that they would deliver up the  town. Then, when they had passed inside the wall, leaving their fleet  empty, Artemisia suddenly made a canal which led to the sea, brought her  fleet thus out of the smaller harbour, and so sailed into the larger.  Disembarking her soldiers, she towed the empty fleet of the Rhodians out  to sea. So the Rhodians were surrounded without means of retreat, and  were slain in the very forum.    15. So Artemisia embarked her own soldiers and oarsmen in the ships of  the Rhodians and set forth for Rhodes. The Rhodians, beholding their own  ships approaching wreathed with laurel, supposed that their  fellow-citizens were returning victorious, and admitted the enemy. Then  Artemisia, after taking Rhodes and killing its leading men, put up in  the city of Rhodes a trophy of her victory, including two bronze  statues, one representing the state of the Rhodians, the other herself.  Herself she fashioned in the act of branding the state of the Rhodians.  In later times the Rhodians, labouring under the religious scruple which  makes it a sin to remove trophies once they are dedicated, constructed a  building to surround the place, and thus by the erection of the \"Grecian  Station\" covered it so that nobody could see it, and ordered that the  building be called \"[Greek: abaton].\"    16. Since such very powerful kings have not disdained walls built of  brick, although with their revenues and from booty they might often have  had them not only of masonry or dimension stone but even of marble, I  think that one ought not to reject buildings made of brick-work,  provided that they are properly \"topped.\" But I shall explain why this  kind of structure should not be used by the Roman people within the  city, not omitting the reasons and the grounds for them.    17. The laws of the state forbid that walls abutting on public property "]]]
