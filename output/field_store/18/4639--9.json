[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#12)"],[1," if you had it stuck through your gizzard, old boy!\"    \"I mean the idea of making it is a good one,\" said I, laughing.  \"And,  now I think of it, I'll change my plan too.  I don't think much of a  club, so I'll make me a sling out of this piece of cloth.  I used to be  very fond of slinging, ever since I read of David slaying Goliath the  Philistine, and I was once thought to be expert at it.\"    So I set to work to manufacture a sling.  For a long time we all worked  very busily without speaking.  At length Peterkin looked up.  \"I say,  Jack, I'm sorry to say I must apply to you for another strip of your  handkerchief to tie on this rascally head with.  It's pretty well torn  at any rate, so you won't miss it.\"    Jack proceeded to comply with this request, when Peterkin suddenly laid  his hand on his arm and arrested him.    \"Hist, man!\" said he; \"be tender!  You should never be needlessly cruel  if you can help it.  Do try to shave past Lord Nelson's mouth without  tearing it, if possible!  Thanks.  There are plenty more handkerchiefs  on the cocoa-nut trees.\"    Poor Peterkin! with what pleasant feelings I recall and record his jests  and humorous sayings now!    While we were thus engaged we were startled by a distant, but most  strange and horrible, cry.  It seemed to come from the sea, but was so  far away that we could not clearly distinguish its precise direction.  Rushing out of our bower, we hastened down to the beach and stayed to  listen.  Again it came, quite loud and distinct on the night air--a  prolonged, hideous cry, something like the braying of an ass.  The moon  had risen, and we could see the islands in and beyond the lagoon quite  plainly; but there was no object visible to account for such a cry.  A  strong gust of wind was blowing from the point whence the sound came,  but this died away while we were gazing out to sea.    \"What can it be?\" said Peterkin in a low whisper, while we all  involuntarily crept closer to each other.    \"Do you know,\" said Jack, \"I have heard that mysterious sound twice  before, but never so loud as to-night.  Indeed, it was so faint that I  thought I must have merely fancied it; so, as I did not wish to alarm  you, I said nothing about it.\"    We listened for a long time for the sound again; but as it did not come,  we returned to the bower and resumed our work.    \"Very strange!\" said Peterkin quite gravely.--\"Do you believe in ghosts,  Ralph?\"    \"No,\" I answered, \"I do not.  Nevertheless, I must confess that strange,  unaccountable sounds, such as we have just heard, make me feel a little  uneasy.\"    \"What say you to it, Jack?\"    \"I neither believe in ghosts nor feel uneasy,\" he replied.  \"I never saw  a ghost myself, and I never met with any one who had; and I have  generally found that strange and unaccountable things have almost always  been accounted for, and found to be quite simple, on close examination.  I certainly can't imagine what _that_ sound is; but I'm quite sure I  shall find out before long, and if it's a ghost I'll--I'll--\"    \"Eat it!\" cried Peterkin.    \"Yes, I'll eat it!--Now, then, my bow and two arrows are finished; so,  if you're ready, we had better turn in.\"    By this time Peterkin had thinned down his spear, and tied an iron point  very cleverly to the end of it; I had formed a sling, the lines of which  were composed of thin strips of the cocoa-nut cloth, plaited; and Jack  had made a stout bow, nearly five feet long, with two arrows, feathered  with two or three large plumes which some bird had dropped.  They had no  barbs; but Jack said that if arrows were well feathered they did not  require iron points, but would fly quite well if merely sharpened at the  point, which I did not know before.    \"A feathered arrow without a barb,\" said he, \"is a good weapon, but a  barbed arrow without feathers is utterly useless.\"    The string of the bow was formed of our piece of whip-cord, part of  which, as he did not like to cut it, was rolled round the bow.    Although thus prepared for a start on the morrow we thought it wise to  exercise ourselves a little in the use of our weapons before starting,  so we spent the whole of the next day in practising.  And it was well we  did so, for we found that our arms were very imperfect, and that we were  far from perfect in the use of them.  First, Jack found that the bow was  much too strong, and he had to thin it.  Also the spear was much too  heavy, and so had to be reduced in thickness, although nothing would  induce Peterkin to have it shortened.  My sling answered very well; but  I had fallen so much out of practice that my first stone knocked off  Peterkin's hat, and narrowly missed making a second Goliath of him.  However, after having spent the whole day in diligent practice, we began  to find some of our former expertness returning, at least Jack and I  did.  As for Peterkin, being naturally a neat-handed boy, he soon  handled his spear well, and could run full tilt at a cocoa-nut, and hit  it with great precision once out of every five times.    But I feel satisfied that we owed much of our rapid success to the  unflagging energy of Jack, who insisted that since we had made him  captain, we should obey him; and he kept us at work from morning till  night, perseveringly, at the same thing.  Peterkin wished very much to  run about and stick his spear into everything he passed; but Jack put up  a cocoa-nut, and would not let him leave off running at that for a  moment except when he wanted to rest.  We laughed at Jack for this, but  we were both convinced that it did us much good.    That night we examined and repaired our arms ere we lay down to rest,  although we were much fatigued, in order that we might be in readiness  to set out on our expedition at daylight on the following morning.        CHAPTER NINE.    PREPARE FOR A JOURNEY ROUND THE ISLAND--SAGACIOUS REFLECTIONS--  MYSTERIOUS APPEARANCES AND STARTLING OCCURRENCES.    Scarcely had the sun shot its first ray across the bosom of the broad  Pacific when Jack sprang to his feet, and hallooing in Peterkin's ear to  awaken him, ran down the beach to take his customary dip in the sea.  We  did not, as was our wont, bathe that morning in our Water Garden, but in  order to save time, refreshed ourselves in the shallow water just  opposite the bower.  Our breakfast was also despatched without loss of  time, and in less than an hour afterwards all our preparations for the  journey were completed.    In addition to his ordinary dress, Jack tied a belt of cocoa-nut cloth  round his waist, into which he thrust the axe.  I was also advised to  put on a belt and carry a short cudgel or bludgeon in it, for, as Jack  truly remarked, the sling would be of little use if we should chance to  come to close quarters with any wild animal.  As for Peterkin,  notwithstanding that he carried such a long and, I must add,  frightful-looking spear over his shoulder, we could not prevail on him  to leave his club behind; \"for,\" said he, \"a spear at close quarters is  not worth a button.\"  I must say that it seemed to me that the club was,  to use his own style of language, not worth a button-hole; for it was  all knotted over at the head, something like the club which I remember  to have observed in picture-books of Jack the Giant-killer, besides  being so heavy that he required to grasp it with both hands in order to  wield it at all.  However, he took it with him, and in this manner we  set out upon our travels.    We did not consider it necessary to carry any food with us, as we knew  that wherever we went we should be certain to fall in with cocoa-nut  trees--having which we were amply supplied, as Peterkin said, with meat  and drink and pocket-handkerchiefs!  I took the precaution, however, to  put the burning-glass into my pocket lest we should want fire.    The morning was exceedingly lovely.  It was one of that very still and  peaceful sort which made the few noises that we heard seem to be quiet  noises (I know no other way of expressing this idea)--noises which, so  far from interrupting the universal tranquillity of earth, sea, and sky,  rather tended to reveal to us how quiet the world round us really was.  Such sounds as I refer to were the peculiar, melancholy--yet, it seemed  to me, cheerful--plaint of sea-birds floating on the glassy waters or  sailing in the sky; also the subdued twittering of little birds among  the bushes, the faint ripples on the beach, and the solemn boom of the  surf upon the distant coral reef.  We felt very glad in our hearts as we  walked along the sands, side by side.  For my part, I felt so deeply  overjoyed that I was surprised at my own sensations, and fell into a  reverie upon the causes of happiness.  I came to the conclusion that a  state of profound peace and repose, both in regard to outward objects  and within the soul, is the happiest condition in which man can be  placed; for although I had many a time been most joyful and happy when  engaged in bustling, energetic, active pursuits or amusements, I never  found that such joy or satisfaction was so deep or so pleasant to  reflect upon as that which I now experienced.  And I was the more  confirmed in this opinion when I observed--and, indeed, as told by  himself--that Peterkin's happiness was also very great; yet he did not  express this by dancing, as was his wont, nor did he give so much as a  single shout, but walked quietly between us with his eye sparkling and a  joyful smile upon his countenance.  My reader must not suppose that I  thought all this in the clear and methodical manner in which I have set  it down here.  These thoughts did indeed pass through my mind; but they  did so in a very confused and indefinite manner, for I was young at that  time and not much given to deep reflections.  Neither did I consider  that the peace whereof I write is not to be found in this world--at  least in its perfection--although I have since learned that,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21724"],[0,"The Handbook of Soap Manufacture (#12)"],[1,"\"purging nut  tree,\" which is similar to the castor oil plant, and is cultivated in  Cape Verde Islands and other Portuguese Colonies.
