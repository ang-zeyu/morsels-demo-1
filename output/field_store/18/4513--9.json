[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19279"],[0,"Memorials of the Faithful (#12)"],[1,"thanks and be acceptable to  God.(36)            MIRZA MUHAMMAD-QULI      Jinab-i-Mirza Muhammad-Quli(37) was a loyal brother of the Blessed Beauty.  This great man was known even from his childhood for nobility of soul. He  was newly born when his distinguished father passed away, and thus it came  about that from the beginning to the end of his days, he spent his life in  the sheltering arms of Baha'u'llah. He was detached from every selfish  thought, averse to every mention except to whatever concerned the Holy  Cause. He was reared in Persia under the care of Baha'u'llah, and in 'Iraq  as well, especially favored by Him. In the presence of Baha'u'llah, it was  he who would pass around the tea; and he waited upon his Brother at all  times, by day and night. He was always silent. He always held fast to the  Covenant of \"Am I not your Lord?\" He was encompassed by loving-kindness  and bounty; day and night he had access to the presence of Baha'u'llah; he  was invariably patient and forbearing, until in the end he reached the  very heights of Divine favor and acceptance.    He kept always to his own way of being. He traveled in the company of  Baha'u'llah; from 'Iraq to Constantinople he was with the convoy and at  the halting-places it was his task to pitch the tents. He served with the  greatest diligence, and did not know the meaning of lethargy or fatigue.  In Constantinople as well, and later in the Land of Mystery, Adrianople,  he continued on, in one and the same invariable condition.    With his peerless Lord, he then was exiled to the Akka fortress, condemned  by order of the Sultan to be imprisoned forever.(38) But he accepted in  the same spirit all that came his way--comfort and torment, hardship and  respite, sickness and health; eloquently, he would return thanks to the  Blessed Beauty for His bounties, uttering praise with a free heart and a  face that shone like the sun. Each morning and evening he waited upon  Baha'u'llah, delighting in and sustained by His presence; and mostly, he  kept silent.    When the Beloved of all mankind ascended to the Kingdom of Splendors,  Mirza Muhammad-Quli remained firm in the Covenant, shunning the craft, the  malice and hypocrisy which then appeared, devoting himself entirely to  God, supplicating and praying. To those who would listen he gave wise  advice; and he called to mind the days of the Blessed Beauty and grieved  over the fact that he himself lived on. After the departure of  Baha'u'llah, he did not draw an easeful breath; he kept company with no  one, but stayed by himself most of the time, alone in his small refuge,  burning with the fires of separation. Day by day he grew feebler, more  helpless, until at the last he soared away to the world of God. Upon him  be peace; upon him be praise and mercy, in the gardens of Heaven. His  luminous grave is in Naqib, by Tiberias.            USTAD BAQIR AND USTAD AHMAD      And again among those who left their homeland were two carpenters, Ustad  Baqir and Ustad Ahmad. These two were brothers, of pure lineage, and  natives of Ka_sh_an. From the time when both became believers each held  the other in his embrace. They harkened to the voice of God, and to His  cry of \"Am I not your Lord?\" they replied, \"Yea, verily!\"    For a time they stayed on in their own country, occupied with the  remembrance of God, characterized by faith and knowledge, respected by  friend and stranger alike, known to all for righteousness and  trustworthiness, for austerity of life and the fear of God. When the  oppressor stretched forth his hands against them, and tormented them  beyond endurance, they emigrated to 'Iraq, to the sheltering care of  Baha'u'llah. They were two most blessed souls. For some time they remained  in 'Iraq, praying in all lowliness, and supplicating God.    Then Ustad Ahmad departed for Adrianople, while Ustad Baqir remained in  'Iraq and was taken as a prisoner to Mosul. Ustad Ahmad went on with the  party of Baha'u'llah to the Most Great Prison, and Ustad Baqir emigrated  from Mosul to Akka. Both of the brothers were under the protection of God  and free from every earthly bond. In the prison, they worked at their  craft, keeping to themselves, away from friend and stranger alike.  Tranquil, dignified, confident, strong in faith, sheltered by the  All-Merciful, they happily spent their days. Ustad Baqir was the first to  die, and some time afterward his brother followed him.    These two were firm believers, loyal, patient, at all times thankful, at  all times supplicating God in lowliness, with their faces turned in His  direction. During that long stay in the prison they were never neglectful  of duty, never at fault. They were constantly joyful, for they had drunk  deep of the holy cup; and when they soared upward, out of the world, the  friends mourned over them and asked that by the grace of Baha'u'llah, they  should be favored and forgiven. These two were embosomed in bounty, and  Divinely sustained, and the Blessed Beauty was well pleased with them  both; with this provision for their journey, they set out for the world to  come. Upon them both be the glory of God the All-Glorious; to each be a  seat of truth(39) in the Kingdom of Splendors.            MUHAMMAD HANA-SAB      This man of dignity and rank, Aqa Muhammad, was yet another among those  who abandoned their homes, and was one of the earliest believers. From the  dawn tide, he was widely known as a lover of the Most Great Light. He was  then in Isfahan, and he shut his eyes to this world and the next as  well,(40) and opened them to the beauty of Him Who is the embodiment of  all that is lovable.(41)    Aqa Muhammad could no longer find rest, for he had come alive through the  musk-laden breathings of God; his heart was alight, he could inhale the  holy fragrance, he had an eye to see, an ear to hear. He guided a number  of souls, remaining true and loyal to the great Cause. He endured terrible  persecution and torment, but did not falter. Then he found favor in the  eyes of the King of Martyrs and became a trusted attendant of the Beloved  of Martyrs,(42) serving them for some years. He was confirmed in his work,  so that on many occasions the King of Martyrs expressed satisfaction with  him, saying, \"This man is one of those souls who are at rest; he is indeed  well-pleased with his Lord, and well-pleasing unto Him.(43) His faith is  unalloyed, he loves God, he has a good character, and leads a good life.  He is also an agreeable companion, and an eloquent one.\"    After the King of Martyrs was put to death, Aqa Muhammad stayed on for a  time in Isfahan, consumed with mourning for him. Finally he emigrated to  the Most Great Prison, where he was received by Baha'u'llah, and won the  high honor of sweeping the ground about the Threshold. He was patient,  forbearing, a true friend and companion. Then the Supreme Affliction came  upon us, and Aqa Muhammad was in such anguish that he was unable to rest  for a moment. At every dawn he would rise and would sweep the ground about  the house of Baha'u'llah, his tears pouring down like rain, chanting  prayers as he worked.    What a holy being he was, how great a man! He could not bear the  separation very long, but died, and hastened onward to the world of  lights, to the assemblage where the beauty of God is unveiled. May God  shed upon his grave rays from the realm of forgiveness, and lull his  spirit in the heart of Paradise. May God exalt his station in the gardens  above. His bright tomb is in Akka.            HAJI FARAJU'LLAH TAFRISHI      Yet another of those who came out of their homeland to live in the  neighborhood of Baha'u'llah was Faraju'llah of Tafri_sh_. This blessed  individual was from earliest youth the servant of Baha'u'llah, and with  his esteemed father, Aqa Lutfu'llah, he emigrated from Persia to  Adrianople. Aqa Lutfu'llah was a staunch believer, lovingly devoted to the  Blessed Beauty. Patient, long-suffering, completely indifferent to this  world and its vanities, he lived content in the neighborhood of  Baha'u'llah; and then humbly at the Threshold, with a contrite heart, he  abandoned this fleeting life and soared away to the boundless realms  beyond. His sweet-scented dust is in Adrianople.    As for Haji Faraju'llah, he lived on in that city, until the day when  merciless oppressors banished Baha'u'llah to Akka, and in His company the  Haji came here to the Most Great Prison. Later on, when hardship was  changed into ease, he engaged in trade, becoming a partner to  Muhammad-'Ali of Isfahan. For some time he prospered and was happy. Then  he was given leave to go, and journeyed to India, where he spent a long  period before he winged his way into the gardens of forgiveness, and  entered the precincts of ineffable mercy.    This servant of the Blessed Beauty was one with the believers in their  afflictions and calamities; he had his share of the anguish. The favors of  Baha'u'llah compassed him about, and he rejoiced in that boundless grace.  He was among the companions, a close associate of the friends, and he had  a docile heart. Although his body was thin and sickly, he was thankful,  accepted it, was patient, and endured the trials of God's path. Unto him  be greetings and praise; may he receive Heavenly gifts and blessings; upon  him be the glory of God the All-Glorious. His pure sepulcher is in Bombay,  India.            AQA IBRAHIM-I-ISFAHANI AND HIS BROTHERS      And among those who emigrated and came to settle in the Holy Land was Aqa  Ibrahim, one of four honored brothers: Muhammad-Sadiq; Muhammad-Ibrahim;  Aqa Habibu'llah; and Muhammad-'Ali. These four lived in Ba_gh_dad with  their paternal uncle, Aqa Muhammad-Rida, known as Arid. They all lived in  the same house, and remained together day and night. Bird-like, they  shared the one nest; and they were always fresh and full of grace, like  flowers in a bed.    When the Ancient Beauty arrived in 'Iraq"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19282"],[0,"The Promised Day Is Come (#12)"],[1," Land [Tihran] from such as have  repudiated the Book, ere the day whereon the Remembrance of God cometh,  terribly and of a sudden, with His potent Cause, by the leave of God, the  Most High. God, verily, hath prescribed to thee to submit unto Him Who is  His Remembrance, and unto His Cause, and to subdue, with the truth and by  His leave, the countries, for in this world thou hast been mercifully  invested with sovereignty, and will, in the next, dwell, nigh unto the  Seat of Holiness, with the inmates of the Paradise of His good pleasure.  Let not thy sovereignty deceive thee, O _Sh_ah, for 'every soul shall  taste of death,' and this, in very truth, hath been written down as a  decree of God.\"    In His Tablet to Muhammad _Sh_ah the Bab, moreover, has revealed: \"I am  the Primal Point from which have been generated all created things. I am  the Countenance of God Whose splendor can never be obscured, the Light of  God Whose radiance can never fade.... All the keys of heaven God hath  chosen to place on My right hand, and all the keys of hell on My left....  I am one of the sustaining pillars of the Primal Word of God. Whosoever  hath recognized Me, hath known all that is true and right, and hath  attained all that is good and seemly.... The substance wherewith God hath  created Me is not the clay out of which others have been formed. He hath  conferred upon Me that which the worldly-wise can never comprehend, nor  the faithful discover....    \"By My life! But for the obligation to acknowledge the Cause of Him Who is  the Testimony of God ... I would not have announced this unto thee.... In  that same year [year 60] I despatched a messenger and a book unto thee,  that thou mightest act towards the Cause of Him Who is the Testimony of  God as befitteth the station of thy sovereignty....    \"I swear by the truth of God! Were he who hath been willing to treat Me in  such a manner to know who it is whom he hath so treated, he, verily, would  never in his life be happy. Nay--I, verily, acquaint thee with the truth of  the matter--it is as if he hath imprisoned all the Prophets, and all the  men of truth, and all the chosen ones.... Woe betide him from whose hands  floweth evil, and blessed the man from whose hands floweth good....    \"I swear by God! I seek no earthly goods from thee, be it as much as a  mustard seed.... I swear by the truth of God! Wert thou to know that which  I know, thou wouldst forego the sovereignty of this world and of the next,  that thou mightest attain My good pleasure, through thine obedience unto  the True One.... Wert thou to refuse, the Lord of the world would raise up  one who will exalt His Cause, and the Command of God will, verily, be  carried into effect.\"            GOD'S VICAR ON EARTH      Dear friends! How vast a panorama these gemlike, these soul-searching  divinely uttered pronouncements outspread before our eyes! What memories  they evoke! How sublime the principles they inculcate! What hopes they  engender! What apprehensions they excite! And yet how fragmentary must  these above-quoted words, suited as they are to the immediate purpose of  my theme, appear when compared with the torrential majesty which only the  reading of the full text can disclose! He Who was God's Vicar on earth,  addressing, at the most critical moment when His Revelation was attaining  its zenith, those who concentrated in their persons the splendor, the  sovereignty, and the strength of earthly dominion, could certainly not  subtract one jot or tittle from the weight and force which the  presentation of so historic a Message demanded. Neither the perils which  were fast closing in upon Him, nor the formidable power with which the  doctrine of absolute sovereignty invested, at that time, the emperors of  the West and the potentates of the East, could restrain the Exile and  Prisoner of Adrianople from communicating the full blast of His Message to  His twin imperial persecutors as well as to the rest of their  fellow-sovereigns.    The magnitude and diversity of the theme, the cogency of the argument, the  sublimity and audacity of the language, arrest our attention and astound  our minds. Emperors, kings and princes, chancellors and ministers, the  Pope himself, priests, monks and philosophers, the exponents of learning,  parliamentarians and deputies, the rich ones of the earth, the followers  of all religions, and the people of Baha--all are brought within the  purview of the Author of these Messages, and receive, each according to  their merits, the counsels and admonitions they deserve. No less amazing  is the diversity of the subjects touched upon in these Tablets. The  transcendent majesty and unity of an unknowable and unapproachable God is  extolled, and the oneness of His Messengers proclaimed and emphasized. The  uniqueness, the universality and potentialities of the Baha'i Faith are  stressed, and the purpose and character of the Babi Revelation unfolded.  The significance of Baha'u'llah's sufferings and banishments is disclosed,  and the tribulations rained down upon His Herald and upon His Namesake  recognized and lamented. His own yearning for the crown of martyrdom,  which they both so mysteriously won, is voiced, and the ineffable glories  and wonders in store for His own Dispensation foreshadowed. Episodes, at  once moving and marvelous, at various stages of His ministry, are  recounted, and the transitoriness of worldly pomp, fame, riches, and  sovereignty, repeatedly and categorically asserted. Appeals for the  application of the highest principles in human and international relations  are forcibly and insistently made, and the abandonment of discreditable  practices and conventions, detrimental to the happiness, the growth, the  prosperity and the unity of the human race, enjoined. Kings are censured,  ecclesiastical dignitaries arraigned, ministers and plenipotentiaries  condemned, and the identification of His advent with the coming of the  Father Himself unequivocally admitted and repeatedly announced. The  violent downfall of a few of these kings and emperors is prophesied, two  of them are definitely challenged, most are warned, all are appealed to  and exhorted.    In the Lawh-i-Sultan (Tablet to the _Sh_ah of Persia) Baha'u'llah  declares: \"Would that the world-adorning wish of His Majesty might decree  that this Servant be brought face to face with the divines of the age, and  produce proofs and testimonies in the presence of His Majesty the _Sh_ah!  This Servant is ready, and taketh hope in God, that such a gathering may  be convened in order that the truth of the matter may be made clear and  manifest before His Majesty the _Sh_ah. It is then for thee to command,  and I stand ready before the throne of thy sovereignty. Decide, then, for  Me or against Me.\"    And moreover, in the Lawh-i-Ra'is, Baha'u'llah, recalling His conversation  with the Turkish officer charged with the task of enforcing His banishment  to the fortress-town of Akka, has written: \"There is a matter, which, if  thou findest it possible, I request thee to submit to His Majesty the  Sultan, that for ten minutes this Youth be enabled to meet him, so that he  may demand whatsoever he deemeth as a sufficient testimony and regardeth  as proof of the veracity of Him Who is the Truth. Should God enable Him to  produce it, let him, then, release these wronged ones, and leave them to  themselves.\" \"He promised,\" Baha'u'llah adds in that Tablet, \"to transmit  this message, and to give Us his reply. We received, however, no news from  him. Although it becometh not Him Who is the Truth to present Himself  before any person, inasmuch as all have been created to obey Him, yet in  view of the condition of these little children and the large number of  women so far removed from their friends and countries, We have acquiesced  in this matter. In spite of this nothing hath resulted. Umar himself is  alive and accessible. Inquire from him, that the truth may be made known  unto you.\"    Referring to these Tablets addressed to the sovereigns of the earth, and  which 'Abdu'l-Baha has acclaimed as a \"miracle,\" Baha'u'llah has written:  \"Each one of them hath been designated by a special name. The first hath  been named 'The Rumbling,' the second, 'The Blow,' the third, 'The  Inevitable,' the fourth, 'The Plain,' the fifth, 'The Catastrophe,' and  the others, 'The Stunning Trumpet Blast,' 'The Near Event,' 'The Great  Terror,' 'The Trumpet,' 'The Bugle,' and their like, so that all the  peoples of the earth may know, of a certainty, and may witness, with  outward and inner eyes, that He Who is the Lord of Names hath prevailed,  and will continue to prevail, under all conditions, over all men.... Never  since the beginning of the world hath the Message been so openly  proclaimed.... Glorified be this Power which hath shone forth and  compassed the worlds! This act of the Causer of Causes hath, when  revealed, produced two results. It hath at once sharpened the swords of  the infidels, and unloosed the tongues of such as have turned towards Him  in His remembrance and praise. This is the effect of the fertilizing  winds, mention of which hath been made aforetime in the Lawh-i-Haykal. The  whole earth is now in a state of pregnancy. The day is approaching when it  will have yielded its noblest fruits, when from it will have sprung forth  the loftiest trees, the most enchanting blossoms, the most heavenly  blessings. Immeasurably exalted is the breeze that wafteth from the  garment of thy Lord, the Glorified! For lo, it hath breathed its fragrance  and made all things new! Well it is with them that comprehend. It is  indubitably clear and evident that in these things He Who is the Lord of  Revelation hath sought nothing for Himself. Though aware that they would  lead to tribulations, and be the cause of troubles and afflictive trials,  He, solely as a token of His loving-kindness and favor, and for the  purpose of"]]]
