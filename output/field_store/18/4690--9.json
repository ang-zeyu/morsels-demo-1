Or, \"They pass us by,\" and then what breaking into little laughing  groups, what joy, what dancing, and what praying, that lasted far into  the evening hours.    [Illustration: \"THE LOW, BROAD ARCHES AND THE GREAT, SUPPORTING  PILLARS.\"--VENCE.]    The traveller came back in thought to modern times and went into the  church, that church of five low naves and many restorations, that  product of most diverse fancies. It is painted in lugubrious white, and  its pillars have false bases in a palpable imitation of veined red  marble. Its pure and early form, the Latin cross, is gone, its fine old  stalls are hidden in a gallery, and at the altar Corinthian columns  desecrate its ancient Romanesque. Yet in spite of the incongruities the  atmosphere of the church is truly that of its dim past. There are the  low broad arches, the great, supporting pillars that are massive  buttresses; there is the simple practicality of a style that aimed at a  protecting strength rather than at any art of beauty; there is the  semi-darkness of the small, safe windows, and the little, guarded space  where the praying few increased a thousand-fold in times of danger. This  is, in spite of all defects, the small Provencal church where in days of  peace cloudy incense slowly circled round the shadowy forms of chanting  priests, and where in times of war a crowd of frightened women and their  children prayed in safety for the men who sallied forth to fight in  their defence.      [Sidenote: Grasse.]    He who is unloving of the past may well rush by its treasures in a  puffing automobile, he who is bored by olden thoughts can hurry on by  rail, but the man who wishes to know the old hill-towns of France, to  see them as they seemed to their makers, and realise their one-time  magnificence and strength, must walk from one town to the next, and  climb their steep heights; must see great towers rise before him, great  walls loom above him, and realise how grandly strong these places were  when it was man to man and sword to sword, strength against strength. He  must arrive, dust-covered, at the cities' gates or drive into their  narrow streets on the small coach which still passes through,--for they  are of the times when great men rode and peasants walked and steam was  all unknown. Then he will realise how very large the world once was, how  far from town to town; and once within those high, protecting walls, he  will understand why the citizen of mediaeval days found in his town a  world sufficient to itself, and why he was so often well content to  spend his life at home.    The power and the force of an isolated, self-concentrated interest is  well illustrated in the history of the free cities of the Middle Ages,  and Grasse may be counted one of these. Counts she had in name; but the  Berengers and Queen Jeanne had granted her charters which she had the  power to keep; she was once wealthy enough to declare war with Pisa, and  in the XII century the leaders of her self-government were \"Consuls by  the grace of God alone.\" Therefore when Antibes continued to be greatly  menaced by blasphemous pirates, the Bishopric was removed to Grasse,  rich, strong, and safe behind the hills, where it endured from 1244,  through all the perils of the centuries, until by a pen-stroke Napoleon  wiped it out in 1801.    [Illustration: \"HIGHER THAN THEM ALL STANDS THE CATHEDRAL.\"--GRASSE.]    To come to Grasse on foot or in the stage, will well repay the traveller  of old-fashioned moods and fancies. Afar, her houses seem to crowd  together, as they used to crowd within the walls, her red roofs rise  fantastically one above the other, and higher than them all stands the  Cathedral with its firm, square tower. Such must have been old Grasse,  perched on the summit of her hill. But once inside the town, these  illusions cease. Here are the hotels and the Casino of a thermal  station, and the factories of a new world. The traveller finds that the  broad upper boulevards are filled with tourists and smart English  visitors; and in the narrow streets pert factory-hands come noisily from  work. Still he climbs on toward the Cathedral, through tortuous streets  and little alley-ways. And in the gloomiest of them all there is no  odour of a stale antiquity, but the perfume of a garden-full of roses,  of a thousand orange-blossoms, and of locusts, honey-sweet, and he  begins to think himself enchanted. He feels the dark, old houses are  unreal, as if, instead of cobble-stones beneath his feet, there must be  the soft and tender grass of Araby the Blest. Such is the magic of a  trade, the perfume industry of Grasse that for so many hundreds of years  has made her meanest streets full of refreshing fragrance.    Breathless from the climb, the traveller stepped at length into the  little square, before a most ungainly Cathedral. \"Chiefly built in the  XII century,\" it may have been, but so bedizened by the Renaissance that  its heavy old Provencal walls and massive pillars seem to exist merely  as supports for additions or unreasonable decorations of a poor Italian  style. A certain Monseigneur of the XVII century re-built the choir in a  deep, rectangular form; another prelate enlarged the church proper and  ruined it by constructing a tribune over the aisles, and desiring the  revenues of a new burial-place, he ordered Vauban to accomplish the  daring construction of a crypt. Still another Bishop with like  architectural tastes built a large new chapel which opens from the south  aisle; and with these additions and XVIII century changes in the facade,  the original style of the church was obscured. In spite of the pitiful  remains of dignity which its three aisles, its firm old pillars, and its  height still give to the interior, it is as a whole so mean a building  that it has fittingly lost the title of Cathedral.    [Illustration: THE \"PONT D'AVIGNON.\"]          III.    RIVER-SIDE CATHEDRALS.      [Sidenote: Avignon.]    Everything which surrounds the Cathedral of Avignon, its situation, its  city, its history, is so full of romance and glamour that it is only  after very sober second thought one realises that the church itself is  the least of the papal buildings which majestically overtower the Rhone,  or of those royal ruins which face them as proudly on the opposite bank  of the river. Yet no church in Provence is richer in tradition, and in  history more romantic than tradition.    The foundation of this church goes back to the first Avignon, a small  colony of river-fishermen which gave way before the Romans, who  established a city, Avernio, on the great rocky hill two hundred feet  above the Rhone. Some hundreds of years later the first Christian  missionaries to Gaul landed near the mouth of this river,--Mary the  mother of James, Saint Sara the patron of gypsies, Lazarus, his sister  Martha, and Saint Maximin. Before these storm-tossed Saints lay the fair  and pagan country of Provence, the scene of their future mission; and if  tradition is to be further believed, each went his way, to work mightily  for the sacred cause. Maximin lived in the town that bears his name,  Lazarus became the first Bishop of Marseilles, and Saint Martha ascended  the Rhone as far as Avignon and built near the site of the present  Cathedral an oratory in honour of the Virgin \"then living on the earth.\"  Two early churches, of which this chapel was perhaps a part, were  destroyed in the Saracenic sieges of the VIII century; an inscription in  the porch of the present Cathedral records the very interesting mediaeval  account of its re-building and re-consecration nearly a hundred years  later. It was, so runs the tale, the habit of a devout woman to pray in  the church every night; and after the Cathedral had been finished by the  generous aid of Charlemagne, she happened there at midnight, and  witnessed the descent of Christ in wondrous, shining light. There at the  High Altar, surrounded by ministering angels, he dedicated the Cathedral  to His Mother, Our Lady of Cathedrals; and so it has been called to the  present day. If it is an impossible and ungrateful task to disprove that  the re-construction, or at least the re-founding of this Cathedral was  the work of Charlemagne, so munificent a patron and dutiful a son of the  Church, to prove it is equally impossible. A martyrology of the XI  century speaks of a dedication in 1069, but as this ceremony had been  preceded by another extensive re-building, and was followed by many  other changes, the oldest portions of the present church are to be most  accurately ascribed to the XI, XII, and XIV centuries. The additions of  the centuries following the papal return to Rome have greatly changed  the appearance of the church. A large chapel, built in 1506, gives  almost a northern nave. In 1671, Archbishop Ariosto thought the interior  would be gracefully improved by a Renaissance gallery which should  encircle the entire nave from one end of the choir to the other. To  accomplish this new work, the old main piers below the gallery were cut  away, the wall arches were changed, and columns and piers, almost  entirely new, arose to support a shallow, gracefully balustraded balcony  and its bases of massive carving. Nine years later a new Archbishop  added to the north side a square XVII century chapel, richly ornamental  in itself, but entirely out of harmony with the fundamental style of the  church. Other chapels, less distinguished, which have been added from  time to time, line the nave both north and south, and all are excrescent  to the original plan. Of the exterior, only the facade retains its  primitive character. The side-walls, \"entirely featureless,\" as has been  well said, \"reflect only the various periods of the chapels which have  been added to the Cathedral,\" and the apse was re-built in 1671, in a  heavy, uninteresting form.

Survey Memoirs_, 1846).       In his autobiography, Darwin refers to this. \"I was forestalled\" he       says, \"in only one important point, which my vanity has always made       me regret.\" (_Life and Letters_, i. p. 88.)         {127} <The following is written on the back of a page of the MS.>       Discuss one or more centres of creation: allude strongly to       facilities of dispersal and amount of geological change: allude to       mountain-summits afterwards to be referred to. The distribution       varies, as everyone knows, according to adaptation, explain going       from N. to S. how we come to fresh groups of species in the same       general region, but besides this we find difference, according to       greatness of barriers, in greater proportion than can be well       accounted for by adaptation. <On representive species see _Origin_,       Ed. i. p. 349, vi. p. 496.> This very striking when we think of       cattle of Pampas, plants <?> &c. &c. Then go into discussion; this       holds with 3 or 4 main divisions as well as the endless minor ones       in each of these 4 great ones: in these I chiefly refer to mammalia       &c. &c. The similarity of type, but not in species, in same       continent has been much less insisted on than the dissimilarity of       different great regions generically: it is more striking.         <I have here omitted an incomprehensible sentence.> Galapagos       Islands, Tristan d'Acunha, _volcanic_ islands covered with craters       we know lately did not support any organisms. How unlike these       islands in nature to neighbouring lands. These facts perhaps more       striking than almost any others. [Geology apt to affect geography       therefore we ought to expect to find the above.]       Geological-geographical distribution. In looking to past times we       find Australia equally distinct. S. America was distinct, though       with more forms in common. N. America its nearest neighbour more in       common,--in some respects more, in some less allied to Europe.       Europe we find <?> equally European. For Europe is now part of Asia       though not <illegible>. Africa unknown,--examples, Elephant,       Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus, Hyaena. As geology destroys geography we       cannot be surprised in going far back we find Marsupials and       Edentata in Europe: but geology destroys geography.    Now according to analogy of domesticated animals let us see what would  result. Let us take case of farmer on Pampas, where everything  approaches nearer to state of nature. He works on organisms having  strong tendency to vary: and he knows <that the> only way to make a  distinct breed is to select and separate. It would be useless to  separate the best bulls and pair with best cows if their offspring run  loose and bred with the other herds, and tendency to reversion not  counteracted; he would endeavour therefore to get his cows on islands  and then commence his work of selection. If several farmers in different  _rincons_{128} were to set to work, especially if with different  objects, several breeds would soon be produced. So would it be with  horticulturist and so history of every plant shows; the number of  varieties{129} increase in proportion to care bestowed on their  selection and, with crossing plants, separation. Now, according to this  analogy, change of external conditions, and isolation either by chance  landing <of> a form on an island, or subsidence dividing a continent, or  great chain of mountains, and the number of individuals not being  numerous will best favour variation and selection{130}. No doubt change  could be effected in same country without any barrier by long continued  selection on one species: even in case of a plant not capable of  crossing would easier get possession and solely occupy an island{131}.  Now we can at once see that <if> two parts of a continent isolated, new  species thus generated in them, would have closest affinities, like  cattle in counties of England: if barrier afterwards destroyed one  species might destroy the other or both keep their ground. So if island  formed near continent, let it be ever so different, that continent would  supply inhabitants, and new species (like the old) would be allied with  that continent. An island generally very different soil and climate, and  number and order of inhabitants supplied by chance, no point so  favourable for generation of new species{132},--especially the  mountains, hence, so it is. As isolated mountains formed in a plain  country (if such happens) is an island. As other islands formed, the old  species would spread and thus extend and the fauna of distant island  might ultimately meet and a continent formed between them. No one doubts  continents formed by repeated elevations and depressions{133}. In  looking backwards, but not so far that all geographical boundaries are  destroyed, we can thus at once see why existing forms are related to the  extinct in the same manner as existing ones are in some part of existing  continent. By chance we might even have one or two absolute parent  fossils.         {128} _Rincon_ in Spanish means a _nook_ or _corner_, it is here       probably used to mean a small farm.         {129} The following is written across the page: \"No one would       expect a set of similar varieties to be produced in the different       countries, so species different.\"         {130} <The following passage seems to have been meant to follow       here.> The parent of an organism, we may generally suppose to be in       less favourable condition than the selected offspring and therefore       generally in fewer numbers. (This is not borne out by horticulture,       mere hypothesis; as an organism in favourable conditions might by       selection be adapted to still more favourable conditions.)         Barrier would further act in preventing species formed in one part       migrating to another part.         {131} <The following notes occur on the back of the page.> Number       of species not related to capabilities of the country: furthermore       not always those best adapted, perhaps explained by creationists by       changes and progress. <See p. 34, note 1.{Note 134}>         Although creationists can, by help of geology, explain much, how       can he explain the marked relation of past and present in same       area, the varying relation in other cases, between past and       present, the relation of different parts of same great area. If       island, to adjoining continent, if quite different, on mountain       summits,--the number of individuals not being related to       capabilities, or how &c.--our theory, I believe, can throw much       light and all facts accord.         {132} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 390, vi. p. 543.         {133} On oscillation see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 291, vi. p. 426.    The detection of transitional forms would be rendered more difficult on  rising point of land.    The distribution therefore in the above enumerated points, even the  trivial ones, which on any other <theory?> can be viewed as so many  ultimate facts, all follow <in> a simple manner on the theory of the  occurrence of species by <illegible> and being adapted by selection to  <illegible>, conjoined with their power of dispersal, and the steady  geographico-geological changes which are now in progress and which  undoubtedly have taken place. Ought to state the opinion of the  immutability of species and the creation by so many separate acts of  will of the Creator{134}.         {134} <From the back of MS.> Effect of climate on stationary island       and on continent, but continent once island. Moreover repeated       oscillations fresh diffusion when non-united, then isolation, when       rising again immigration prevented, new habitats formed, new       species, when united free immigration, hence uniform characters.       Hence more forms <on?> the island. Mountain summits. Why not true       species. First let us recall in Part I, conditions of variation:       change of conditions during several generations, and if frequently       altered so much better [perhaps excess of food]. Secondly, continued       selection [while in wild state]. Thirdly, isolation in all or nearly       all,--as well to recall advantages of.         [In continent, if we look to terrestrial animal, long continued       change might go on, which would only cause change in numerical       number <? proportions>: if continued long enough might ultimately       affect all, though to most continents <there is> chance of       immigration. Some few of whole body of species must be long affected       and entire selection working same way. But here isolation absent,       without barrier, cut off such <illegible>. We can see advantage of       isolation. But let us take case of island thrown up by volcanic       agency at some distances, here we should have occasional visitants,       only in few numbers and exposed to new conditions and <illegible>       more important,--a quite new grouping of organic beings, which would       open out new sources of subsistence, or <would> control <?> old       ones. The number would be few, can old have the very best opportunity.       <The conquest of the indigenes by introduced organisms shows that       the indigenes were not perfectly adapted, see _Origin_, Ed. i. p.       390.> Moreover as the island continued changing,--continued slow       changes, river, marshes, lakes, mountains &c. &c., new races as       successively formed and a fresh occasional visitant.         If island formed continent, some species would emerge and"]]]
