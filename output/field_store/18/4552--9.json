We were at the top of the stairway, where the mountain, ascent of  which frees one from ill, is the second time cut back. There a  cornice binds the hill round about, in like manner as the first,  except that its arc bends more quickly. No shadow is there, nor  mark which is apparent [1] so that the bank appears smooth and so  the path, with the livid color of the stone.    [1] No sculptured or engraved scenes.      \"If to enquire one waits here for people,\" said the Poet, \"I fear  that perhaps our choice will have too much delay.\" Then he set  his eyes fixedly upon the sun, made of his right side the centre  for his movement, and turned the left part of himself. \"O sweet  light, with confidence in which I enter on the new road, do thou  lead us on it,\" he said, \"as there is need for leading here  within. Thou warmest the world, thou shinest upon it; if other  reason prompt not to the contrary, thy rays ought ever to be  guides.\"    As far as here on earth is counted for a mile, so far had we now  gone there, in little time because of ready will; and towards us  were heard to fly, not however seen, spirits uttering courteous  invitations to the table of love. The first voice that passed  flying, \"Virum non habent,\"[1] loudly said, and went on behind  us reiterating it. And before it had become quite inaudible  through distance, another passed by, crying, \"I am Orestes,\" [2]  and also did not stay. \"O Father,\" said I, \"what voices are  these?\" and even as I was asking, lo! the third, saying, \"Love  them from whom ye have had wrong.\" And the good Master: \"This  circle scourges the sin of envy, and therefore from love are  drawn the cords of the scourge. The curb must be of the opposite  sound; I think that thou wilt hear it before thou arrivest at the  pass of pardon.[3] But fix thine eyes very fixedly through the  air, and thou wilt see in front of us people sitting, and each is  seated against the rock.\" Then more than before I opened my eyes;  I looked in front of me, and saw shades with cloaks in color not  different from the stone. And when we were a little further  forward, I heard them crying, \"Mary, pray for us!\" crying,  \"Michael,\" and \"Peter,\" and all the Saints.    [1] \"They have no wine.\"--John ii. 3. The words of Mary at the  wedding feast of Cana, symbolic of a kindness that is a rebuke of  envy.    [2] The words of Pylades, before Aegisthus, when contending with  Orestes to be put to death in his stead.    [3] At the stair to the third ledge, at the foot of which stands  the angel who cancels the sin of envy.        I do not believe there goes on earth to-day a man so hard that he  had not been pricked by compassion at that which I then saw. For  when I had approached so near to them that their actions came  surely to me, tears were drawn from my eyes by heavy grief. They  seemed to me covered with coarse haircloth, and one supported the  other with his shoulders, and all were supported by the bank.  Thus the blind, who lack subsistence, stand at pardons[1] to beg  for what they need, and one bows his head upon another, so that  pity may quickly be moved in others, not only by the sound of the  words, but by the sight which implores no less. And as to the  blind the sun profits not, so to the shades, there where I was  now speaking, the light of Heaven wills not to make largess of  itself; for a wire of iron pierces and sews up the eyelids of  all; even as is done to a wild sparrow-hawk, because it stays not  quiet.    [1] On occasion of special indulgences the beggars gather at the  door of churches frequented by those who seek the pardons to be  obtained within.      It seemed to me I was doing outrage as I went on, seeing others,  not myself being seen, wherefore I turned me to my sage Counsel;  well did he know what the dumb wished to say, and therefore  waited not my asking, but said, \"Speak, and be brief and to the  point.\"    Virgil was coming with me on that side of the cornice from which  one may fall, because it is encircled by no rim. On the other  side of me were the devout shades, that through the horrible  stitches were pressing out the tears so that they bathed their  cheeks. I turned me to them, and, \"O folk secure,\" I began, \"of  seeing the lofty light which alone your desire holds in its care,  may grace speedily dissolve the scum of your consciences so that  the stream of memory through them may descend clear,[1] tell me,  for it will be gracious and dear to me, if there be a soul here  among you that is Latin, and perhaps it will be good for him if I  learn it.\" \"O my brother, each is a citizen of one true city,[2]  but thou meanest, who lived in Italy while a pilgrim.\"[3] This it  seemed to me to hear for answer somewhat further on than where I  was standing; wherefore I made myself heard still more that way.  Among the others I saw a shade that was expectant in look; and,  if any one should wish to ask, How?--like a blind man it was  lifting up its chin. \"Spirit,\" said I, \"that humblest thyself in  order to ascend, if thou art that one which answered me, make  thyself known to me either by place or by name.\" \"I was a  Sienese,\" it answered, \"and with these others I cleanse here my  guilty life, weeping to Him that He grant Himself to us. Sapient  I was not, although I was called Sapia, and I was far more glad  of others' harm than of my own good fortune. And that thou mayst  not believe that I deceive thee, bear if I was foolish as I tell  thee. The arch of my years already descending, my fellow-citizens  were joined in battle near to Colle[4] with their adversaries,  and I prayed God for that which He willed. They were routed  there, and turned into the bitter passes of flight; and I, seeing  the pursuit, experienced a joy unmatched by any other; so much  that I turned upward my audacious face, crying out to God, 'Now  no more I fear thee;' as the blackbird doth because of a little  fair weather. At the very end of my life I desired peace with  God; and even yet my debt would not be lessened by penitence,[5]  had it not been that Pier Pettinagno,[6] who out of charity was  sorry for me, held me in memory in his holy prayers. But thou,  who art thou that goest asking of our conditions, and bearest  thine eyes loose as I think, and breathing dost speak?\" \"My  eyes,\" said I, \"will yet be taken from me here but a little time,  for small is the offence committed through their being turned  with envy. Far greater is the fear, with which my soul is in  suspense, of the torment beneath, and already the load down there  weighs upon me. And she to me, \"Who then hath led thee here up  among us, if thou thinkest to return below?\" And I, \"This one who  is with me, and says not a word: and I am alive; and therefore  ask of me, spirit elect, if thou wouldst that I should yet move  for thee on earth my mortal feet.\" \"Oh, this is so strange a  thing to hear,\" she replied, \"that it is great sign that God  loves thee; therefore assist me sometimes with thy prayer. And I  beseech thee, by that which thou most desirest, if ever thou  tread the earth of Tuscany, that with my kindred thou restore my  fame. Thou wilt see them among that vain people which hopes in  Talamone,[7] and will waste more hope there, than in finding the  Diana[8] but the admirals will stake the most there.[9]    [1] Being purified from sin they will retain no memory of it.    [2] \"Fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of  God.\"--Ephesians, ii. 19.    [3] \"For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to  come.\"--Hebrews, xiii. 14.    [4] This was the battle in 1259, in which the Florentines routed  die Sienese Ghibellines, at whose head was Provenzan Salvani. who  was slain. See Canto XI.    [5] I should not yet within Purgatory have diminished my debt of  expiation, but, because I delayed repentance till the hour of  Death, I should still be outside the gate.    [6] A poor comb-dealer, a man of kind heart, honest dealings, and  good deeds, and still remembered for them in Siena. He died in  1289.    [7] A little port on the coast of Tuscany, on which the Sienese  wasted toil and money in the vain hope that by strengthening and  enlarging it they could make themselves rivals at sea of the  Pisans and Genoese.    [8] A subterranean stream supposed to flow beneath the city.    [9] Of these last words the meaning is obscure.        CANTO XIV. Second Ledge: the Envious--Guido del Duca.--Rinieri  de' Calboli.--Examples of the punishment of Envy.      \"Who is this that circles our mountain ere death have given him  flight, and opens and shuts his eyes at his own will?\"[1] \"I know  not who he is, but I know that he is not alone. Do thou, who art  nearer to him, ask him; and sweetly, so that he may speak, accost  him.\" Thus two spirits, leaning one to the other, discoursed of  me there on the right hand, then turned up their faces to speak  to me. And one of them said, \"O soul that still fixed in thy body  goest on toward heaven, for charity console us, and tell us  whence thou comest, and who thou art; for thou makest us so  marvel at this thy grace, as needs must a thing that never was  before.\" And I, \"Through mid Tuscany there wanders a little  stream, that has its rise on Falterona,[2] and a hundred miles of  coarse does not suffice it. From thereupon I bring this body.  To tell you who I am would be to speak in vain, for my name as  yet makes no great sound.\" \"If I grasp aright thy meaning with my  understanding,\" then replied to me he who had spoken first, \"thou  speakest of the Arno.\" And the other said to him, \"Why did he  conceal the name of that river, even as one does of horrible  things?\" And the shade of whom this was asked, delivered itself  thus, \"I know not, but truly it is fit that the name of such a  valley perish, for from its source (where the rugged mountain  chain, from "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1997"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 3, Paradise (#12)"],[1," of St. Victor at Paris.    [3] Peter Mangiador, or Comestor, \"the Eater,\" so called as being  a devourer of books. He himself wrote books famous in their time.  He was chancellor of the University at Paris, and died in 1198.  The Summae logicales of Peter of Spain, in twelve books, was long  held in high repute. He was made Cardinal Bishop of Tusculum in  1273, and was elected Pope in 1276, taking the name of John XXI.  He was killed in May, 1277, by the fall of the ceiling of the  chamber in which he was sleeping in the Papal palace at Viterbo.  He is the only Pope of recent times whom Dante meets in Paradise.    [4] The famous doctor of the Church, patriarch of Constantinople.    [5] Born about 1033 at Aosta in Piedmont, consecrated Arch.  bishop of Canterbury in 1093, died 1109; magnus et subtilis  doctor in theologia.\"    [6] The compiler of the treatise on grammar (the first of the  seven arts of the Trivium. and the Quadrivium), which was in use  throughout the Middle Ages.    [7] Rabanus Maurus, Archbishop of Mainz, in the ninth century; a  great scholar and teacher, \"cui similem suo tempore non habuit  Ecelesia.\"    [8] Joachim, Abbot of Flora, whose mystic prophecies had great  vogue.      \"The flaming courtesy of Brother Thomas, and his discreet  discourse, moved me to celebrate[1] so great a paladin; and with  me moved this company.\"    [1] Literally, \"to envy;\" hence, perhaps, \"to admire,\" \"to  praise,\" \"to celebrate;\" but the meaning is doubtful.        CANTO XIII. St. Thomas Aquinas speaks again, and explains the  relation of the wisdom of Solomon to that of Adam and of Christ,  and declares the vanity of human judgment.    Let him imagine,[1] who desires to understand well that which I  now saw (and let him retain the image like a firm rock, while I  am speaking), fifteen stars which in different regions vivify the  heaven with brightness so great that it overcomes all thickness  of the air; let him imagine that Wain[2] for which the bosom of  our heaven suffices both night and day, so that in the turning of  its pole it disappears not; let him imagine the mouth of that  horn[3] which begins at the point of the axle on which the primal  wheel goes round,--to have made of themselves two signs in the  heavens, like that which the daughter of Minos made, when she  felt the frost of death,[4] and one to have its rays within the  other, and both to revolve in such manner that one should go  first and the other after; and he will have as it were the shadow  of the true constellation, and of the double dance, which was  circling the point where I was; because it is as much beyond our  wont as the motion of the heaven which outspeeds all the rest is  swifter than the movement of the Chiana.[5] There was sung riot  Bacchus, not Paean, but three Persons in a divine nature, and it  and the human in one Person. The singing and the revolving  completed each its measure, and those holy lights gave attention  to us, making themselves happy from care to care.[6]    [1] To form an idea of the brightness of the two circles of  spirits, let the reader imagine fifteen of the brightest separate  stars, joined with the seven stars of the Great Bear, and with  the two brightest of the Lesser Bear, to form two constellations  like Ariadne's Crown, and to revolve one within the other, one  following the movement of the other.    [2] Charles's Wain, the Great Bear, which never sets.    [3] The Lesser Bear may be imagined as having the shape of a  horn, of which the small end is near the pole of the heavens  around which the Primum Mobile revolves.    [4] When Ariadne died of grief because of her desertion by  Theseus, her garland was changed into the constellation known as  Ariadne's Crown.    [5] The Chiana is one of the most sluggish of the streams of  Tuscany.    [6] Rejoicing in the change from dance and song to tranquillity  for the sake of giving satisfaction to Dante.      Then the light in which the marvellous life of the poor man of  God had been narrated to me broke the silence among those  concordant deities, and said, \"Since one straw is threshed, since  its  seed is now garnered, sweet love invites me to beat out the  other. Thou believest that in the breast, wherefrom the rib was  drawn to form the beautiful cheek whose taste costs dear to all  the world, and in that which, pierced. by the lance, both after  and before made such satisfaction that it overcomes the balance  of all sin, whatever of light it is allowed to human nature to  have was all infused. by that Power which made one and the other;  and therefore thou wonderest at that which I said above, when I  told that the good which in the fifth light is inclosed had no  second. Now open thine eyes to that which I answer to thee, and  thou wilt see thy belief and my speech become in the truth as the  centre in a circle.    \"That which dies not and that which can die are naught but the  splendor of that idea which in His love our Lord God brings to  birth;[1] for that living Light which so proceeds from its Lucent  Source that It is not disunited from It, nor from the Love which  with them is intrined, through Its own bounty collects Its  radiance, as it were mirrored, in nine subsistences, Itself  eternally remaining one. Thence It descends to the ultimate  potentialities, downward from act to act, becoming such that  finally It makes naught save brief contingencies: and these  contingencies I understand. to be the generated things which the  heavens in their motion produce with seed and without.[2] The wax  of these, and that which moulds it, are not of one mode, and  therefore under the ideal stamp it shines now more now less;[3]  whence it comes to pass that one same plant in respect to species  bears better or worse fruit, and that ye are born with diverse  dispositions. If the wax were exactly worked,[4] and the heavens  were supreme in their power, the whole light of the seal would be  apparent. But nature always gives it defective,[5] working like  the artist who has the practice of his art and a hand that  trembles. Nevertheless if the fervent Love disposes and imprints  the clear Light of the primal Power, complete perfection is  acquired here.[6] Thus of old the earth was made worthy of the  complete perfection of the living being;[7] thus was the Virgin  made impregnate;[8] so that I commend thy opinion that human  nature never was, nor will be, what it was in those two persons.    [1] The creation of things eternal and things temporal alike is  the splendid manifestation of the idea which the triune God, in  His love, generated. The living light in the Son, emanating from  its lucent source in the Father, in union with the love of the  Holy Spirit, the three remaining always one, pours out its  radiance through the nine orders of the Angelic Hierarchy, who  distribute it by means of the Heavens of which they axe the  Intelligences.    [2] Through the various movements and conjunctions of the  Heavens, the creative light descends to the lowest elements,  producing all the varieties of contingent things.    [3] The material of contingent or temporal things, and the  influences which shape them, are of various sort, so that the  splendor of the Divine idea is visible in them in different  degree.    [4] If the material were always fit to receive the impression.    [5] Nature, the second Cause, never transmits the whole of the  Creative light.    [6] If, however, the first Cause acts directly,--the fervent  Love imprinting the clear Light of the primal Power,--there can  be no imperfection in the created thing; it answers to the Divine  idea.    [7] Thus, by the immediate operation of the Creator, the earth of  which Adam was formed was made the perfect material for the f  ormation of the creature with a living soul.    [8] In like manner, by the direct act of the Creator.      \"Now, if I should not proceed further, 'Then how was this man  without peer?' would thy words begin. But, in order that that  which is not apparent may clearly appear, consider who he was,  and the occasion which moved him to request, when it was said to  him, 'Ask.' I have not so spoken that thou canst not clearly see  that he was a king, who asked for wisdom, in order that he might  be a worthy king; not to know the number of the motors here on  high, or if necesse with a contingent ever made necesse;[1] non  si est dare primum motum esse,[2] or if in the semicircle a  triangle can be made so that it should not have one right  angle.[3] Wherefore if thou notest this and what I said, a  kingly prudence is that peerless seeing, on which the arrow of  ray intention strikes.[4] And if thou directest clear eyes to the  'has arisen' thou wilt see it has respect only to kings, who are  many, and the good are few. With this distinction[5] take thou my  saying, and thus it can stand with that which thou believest of  the first father, and of our Delight.[6] And let this be ever as  lead to thy feet, to make thee move slow as a weary man, both to  the YES and to the NO which thou seest not; for he is very low  among the fools who affirms or denies without distinction, alike  in the one and in the other case: because it happens, that  oftentimes the current opinion bends in false direction, and then  the inclination binds the understanding. Far more than vainly  does he leave the bank, since he returns not such as be sets out,  who fishes for the truth, and has not the art;[7] and of this are  manifest proofs to the world Parmenides, Melissus, Bryson,[8] and  many others who went on and knew not whither. So did Sabellius,  and Arius,[9] and those fools who were as swords unto the  Scriptures in making their straight faces crooked. Let not the  people still be too secure in judgment, like him who reckons up  the blades in the field ere they are ripe. For I have seen the  briar first show itself stiff and wild all winter long, then bear  the rose upon its top. And I have seen a "]]]
