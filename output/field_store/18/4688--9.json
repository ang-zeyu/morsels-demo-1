This woman said that it was not exactly a case for  the doctor. Nobody that shed so many tears could have good eyes. Ah! the  governor might be surprised; because Smith seemed so brisk in the  daytime, and cheered the old people so much. But she made up for it at  night. Many and many a time she cried the night through.    \"How do you know?\" asked the Commissioner.    \"I sleep in the next bed, sir. I can't say she disturbs any body; for  she is very quiet. But if any thing keeps me awake I hear her sobbing.  And you need but feel her pillow in the morning. It is wet almost  through.\"    \"And does that happen often?\"    \"Yes, sir. Many a time when she has turned her back,--gone into the  infirmary, or been reading to the old people,--I have got her pillow and  dried it. And I have seen her do it herself, with a smile on her face  all the time.\"    The Commissioner walked away. Before he left the place, the woman Smith  was beckoned out by the governor. She went with a beating heart, with  some wild idea in her head that the Morells had sent, that some friends  had turned up. While still in the passage, however, she said to herself  that she might as well look to see her parents risen from the dead.    The Commissioner had, indeed, nothing to tell. He wanted to ask. He did  ask, as much as his delicacy would allow. But he learned nothing;  except, indeed, what he ought to have considered the most important  thing, the state of her mind about being there. About that, she was  frank enough. She said over again to him what she had said to herself,  about this being the right place for one in her circumstances. She  considered that it would be an abuse of private charity for her to be  maintained in idleness at an expense which might set forward in life  some person in a less hopeless position.    \"You speak cheerfully, as if you were in earnest,\" said the  Commissioner.    \"Of course, I am in earnest,\" she replied.    And cheerful she remained throughout the conversation. Only once the  Commissioner saw her eyes filled and a quiver on her lips. He did not  know it; but he had unconsciously called her \"Madam.\"    Would she prefer the children's department of the House? There was no  doubt that she could teach them much. Would she change her quarters? No.  She was too old now for that. She should not be a good companion now for  children; and they would be too much for her. Unless she was wanted--    By no means. She should be where she preferred to be.    She preferred to be where she was. The Commissioner's lady soon after  dropped in, and managed to engage Smith in conversation. But there was  no result; because Smith did not choose that there should be. Perhaps  she was more in the infirmary; and had oftener a warm seat by the fire,  and was spoken to with more deference. But this might be solely owing to  the way she made with the people by her own acts and manners. The  invalids and the infirm grew so fond of her that they poured out to her  all their complaints. She was favored with the knowledge of every  painful sensation as it passed, and every uneasy thought as it arose.    \"I never thought to die in such a place as this,\" groaned old Johnny  Jacks.    \"I wonder at that,\" said his old wife; \"for you never took any care to  provide yourself a better--to say nothing of me.\" And she went on to  tell how Johnny had idled and drank his life away, and brought her here  at last. Much of Johnny's idling and drinking having been connected with  electioneering in an abominably venal city, he was a great talker on  politics, and the state was made responsible for all his troubles. He  said it was a shame that any body should die in a workhouse; he appealed  to his neighbor Smith, who was warming his broth, whether it was not so?    \"Which is best?\" she answered; \"being here, or on a common, or the  sea-sands? Because,\" she added, \"there was a time when old people like  us were left to die wherever they fell. There are countries now where  old people die so. I should not like that.\"    \"You don't mean to say that you or any one likes being here?\"    \"Oh, no; I don't mean to say that. But things are better than they were  once: and they may be better again.\"    \"I shall not live to see that,\" groaned Johnny.    \"No; nor I. But it is something to think of.\"    \"D---- it,\" said Johnny, \"I am not the better for any good that does not  happen to me, nor to any body I know.\"    \"Are not you?\" said neighbor Smith. \"Well, now, I am.\"    And so she was to the end. She died in that infirmary, and not very long  after. When the Morells' letter came, it was plain that they had enough  to do to take care of themselves. So she did not let them know,--in her  reply, written by the hands of the schoolmaster,--where she was. The  letter was so cheerful that they are probably far from suspecting, at  this moment, how she died and was buried. As \"from the abundance of the  heart the mouth speaketh,\" there was so much in her letter as rather  surprised them about her hope and expectation that the time would come  when hearty work in the vigorous season of life should secure its easy  close; and when a greater variety of employment should be opened to  women. There was more of this kind of speculation and less news and  detail of facts than they would have liked. But it was a household event  to have a letter from Miss Smith; and the very little children,  forgetting the wide sea they had passed, began shouting for Miss Smith  to come to them just (as it happened) when her ear was closing to every  human voice.          ON THE ATTEMPTS TO DISCOVER THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE.      There are some peculiarities of style in the following performance,  which is by no means devoid of eloquence, and which derives a certain  interest from the efforts now being made to discover the fate of Sir  John Franklin. The author is GEORGE STOVIN VENABLES, LL. D., of Jesus  College, Cambridge.      THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE.        \"And now there came both mist and snow,      And it grew wondrous cold;      And ice, mast high, came floating by,      As green as emerald.      And through the drifts and snowy clifts      Did send a dismal sheen:      Nor shape of men, nor beasts we ken--      The ice was all between--      The ice was here, the ice was there--      The ice was all around:      It crack'd and growl'd, and roar'd and howl'd,      Like noises in a swound.\"            COLERIDGE. _Rime of the Ancient Mariner._    The secret wonders of the gloomy North bid proud defiance, in their  solitude, to man's triumphant daring. Who shall pierce the ancient  prison-house where Nature's might, in mightier chains of adamantine  frost, lies fettered, since Creation? Who shall live where promontories  huge, of piled ice, like monstrous fragments of primeval worlds tossed  on the surge of Chaos, over the waves rear their triumphant heads, and  laugh to scorn the undreaded kinghood of the lordly sea?    A fearful challenge! yet the charmed spell, which summons man to high  discovery, is ever vocal in the outward world, though they alone may  hear it, who have hearts responsive to its tone. The gale of spring,  breathing sweet balm over the western waters, called forth that gifted  old adventurer[10] to seek the perfumes of spice-laden winds, far in the  Indian Isles. Yea, there is power in Nature's solemn music. All have  heard the sighs of Winter in the middle air, and seen the skirts of his  cloud-woven robe lingering upon the misty mountain-top: but years  rolled on, ere man might understand the mystic invitation of that call  to seek the Monarch in his Arctic home.    At length that call is answered. Daringly yon gallant ship, towards the  Polar Star, walks the untrodden pathways of old Ocean, leaving the  haunts of man. Even now, the bounds are passed where silently the Boreal  Morn[11] folds and unfolds, in swiftest interchange, her silver robe of  alternating light over the midnight Heaven. There is a change in every  sight and sound. White glaciers clash on the tormented waves, in fierce  career waving eternally, and hoary whales, with musical din[12] booming  along the deep, breathe forth in giant chorus, wondrously, the welcome  of the Spirit of the North.    Joy to the brave! That old phantasmal veil which checked the view of dim  antiquity, shrinks from their eagle glance, while fabled hills and  regions of impenetrable ice fade in the blue expanse of mighty  bays[13]--now spread the bosom of the expectant sail unto the Eastern  breeze, and while the prow furrows the yielding waters, image forth high  dreams of lofty hope--the joyous bound of billows gushing between parted  shores, where Asia's rocky brow for ever frowns on the opposing  continent. And, borne on spirit-plumed wings, let fancy soar far from  that sunless clime, to the warm South, where soft skies slumber through  the cloudless noon, o'er the gold palaces of fair Cathay.    Why pause ye in mid ocean? Still the sail swells to the voiceful breeze;  the high mast bends with hideous creak, and every separate rib in the  huge fabric quivers. Yet the ship on the unmoved waters motionless  struggles, as one, who in a feverish dream nervelessly fleeing o'er a  haunted waste, strives horribly to shun some fiendish shape, with  straining sinews, and convulsive gasp, and faint limbs, magic-stricken.  There is rest, dismal and dreary, on the silent sea: most dismal quiet:  for the viewless might of the keen frost-wind[14] crisps the curling  waves, binding their motion with a clankless chain along the far  horizon. Fruitlessly the imprisoned vessel writhes, until the gale,  lulled in the embrace of evening, leaves its prey, to share the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/227"],[0,"Aeneidos (#12)"],[1,"membris dat cura quietem.    Postera Phoebea lustrabat lampade terras,    umentemque Aurora polo dimoverat umbram,    cum sic unanimam adloquitur male sana sororem:    'Anna soror, quae me suspensam insomnia terrent!    Quis novus hic nostris successit sedibus hospes,    quem sese ore ferens, quam forti pectore et armis!    Credo equidem, nec vana fides, genus esse deorum.    Degeneres animos timor arguit:  heu, quibus ille    iactatus fatis! Quae bella exhausta canebat!    Si mihi non animo fixum immotumque sederet,    ne cui me vinclo vellem sociare iugali,    postquam primus amor deceptam morte fefellit;    si non pertaesum thalami taedaeque fuisset,    huic uni forsan potui succumbere culpae.    Anna, fatebor enim, miseri post fata Sychaei    coniugis et sparsos fraterna caede Penatis,    solus hic inflexit sensus, animumque labantem    impulit:  adgnosco veteris vestigia flammae.    Sed mihi vel tellus optem prius ima dehiscat,    vel Pater omnipotens adigat me fulmine ad umbras,    pallentis umbras Erebi noctemque profundam,    ante, Pudor, quam te violo, aut tua iura resolvo.    Ille meos, primus qui me sibi iunxit, amores    abstulit; ille habeat secum servetque sepulchro.'    Sic effata sinum lacrimis implevit obortis.      Anna refert:  'O luce magis dilecta sorori,    solane perpetua maerens carpere iuventa,    nec dulcis natos, Veneris nec praemia noris?    Id cinerem aut Manis credis curare sepultos?    Esto:  aegram nulli quondam flexere mariti,    non Libyae, non ante Tyro; despectus Iarbas    ductoresque alii, quos Africa terra triumphis    dives alit:  placitone etiam pugnabis amori?    Nec venit in mentem, quorum consederis arvis?    Hinc Gaetulae urbes, genus insuperabile bello,    et Numidae infreni cingunt et inhospita Syrtis;    hinc deserta siti regio, lateque furentes    Barcaei.  Quid bella Tyro surgentia dicam,    germanique minas?    Dis equidem auspicibus reor et Iunone secunda    hunc cursum Iliacas vento tenuisse carinas.    Quam tu urbem, soror, hanc cernes, quae surgere regna    coniugio tali! Teucrum comitantibus armis    Punica se quantis attollet gloria rebus!    Tu modo posce deos veniam, sacrisque litatis    indulge hospitio, causasque innecte morandi,    dum pelago desaevit hiemps et aquosus Orion,    quassataeque rates, dum non tractabile caelum.'      His dictis incensum animum inflammavit amore,    spemque dedit dubiae menti, solvitque pudorem.    Principio delubra adeunt, pacemque per aras    exquirunt; mactant lectas de more bidentis    legiferae Cereri Phoeboque patrique Lyaeo,    Iunoni ante omnis, cui vincla iugalia curae.    Ipsa, tenens dextra pateram, pulcherrima Dido    candentis vaccae media inter cornua fundit,    aut ante ora deum pinguis spatiatur ad aras,    instauratque diem donis, pecudumque reclusis    pectoribus inhians spirantia consulit exta.    Heu vatum ignarae mentes! quid vota furentem,    quid delubra iuvant?  Est mollis flamma medullas    interea, et tacitum vivit sub pectore volnus.    Uritur infelix Dido, totaque vagatur    urbe furens, qualis coniecta cerva sagitta,    quam procul incautam nemora inter Cresia fixit    pastor agens telis, liquitque volatile ferrum    nescius; illa fuga silvas saltusque peragrat    Dictaeos; haeret lateri letalis arundo.    Nunc media Aenean secum per moenia ducit,    Sidoniasque ostentat opes urbemque paratam;    incipit effari, mediaque in voce resistit;    nunc eadem labente die convivia quaerit,    Iliacosque iterum demens audire labores    exposcit, pendetque iterum narrantis ab ore.    Post, ubi digressi, lumenque obscura vicissim    luna premit suadentque cadentia sidera somnos,    sola domo maeret vacua, stratisque relictis    incubat, illum absens absentem auditque videtque;    aut gremio Ascanium, genitoris imagine capta,    detinet, infandum si fallere possit amorem.    Non coeptae adsurgunt turres, non arma iuventus    exercet, portusve aut propugnacula bello    tuta parant; pendent opera interrupta, minaeque    murorum ingentes aequataque machina caelo.      Quam simul ac tali persensit peste teneri    cara Iovis coniunx, nec famam obstare furori,    talibus adgreditur Venerem Saturnia dictis:    'Egregiam vero laudem et spolia ampla refertis    tuque puerque tuus, magnum et memorabile nomen,    una dolo divom si femina victa duorum est!    Nec me adeo fallit veritam te moenia nostra    suspectas habuisse domos Karthaginis altae.    Sed quis erit modus, aut quo nunc certamine tanto?    Quin potius pacem aeternam pactosque hymenaeos    exercemus?  Habes, tota quod mente petisti:    ardet amans Dido, traxitque per ossa furorem.    Communem hunc ergo populum paribusque regamus    auspiciis; liceat Phrygio servire marito,    dotalisque tuae Tyrios permittere dextrae.'      Olli---sensit enim simulata mente locutam,    quo regnum Italiae Libycas averteret oras---    sic contra est ingressa Venus:  'Quis talia demens    abnuat, aut tecum malit contendere bello,    si modo, quod memoras, factum fortuna sequatur.    Sed fatis incerta feror, si Iuppiter unam    esse velit Tyriis urbem Troiaque profectis,    miscerive probet populos, aut foedera iungi.    Tu coniunx tibi fas animum temptare precando.    Perge; sequar.  Tum sic excepit regia Iuno:    'Mecum erit iste labor:  nunc qua ratione, quod instat    confieri possit, paucis, adverte, docebo.    Venatum Aeneas unaque miserrima Dido    in nemus ire parant, ubi primos crastinus ortus    extulerit Titan, radiisque retexerit orbem.    His ego nigrantem commixta grandine nimbum,    dum trepidant alae, saltusque indagine cingunt,    desuper infundam, et tonitru caelum omne ciebo.    Diffugient comites et nocte tegentur opaca:    speluncam Dido dux et Troianus eandem    devenient; adero, et, tua si mihi certa voluntas,    [conubio iungam stabili propriamque dicabo,]    hic hymenaeus erit.'---Non adversata petenti    adnuit, atque dolis risit Cytherea repertis.      Oceanum interea surgens Aurora reliquit.    It portis iubare exorto delecta iuventus;    retia rara, plagae, lato venabula ferro,    Massylique ruunt equites et odora canum vis.    Reginam thalamo cunctantem ad limina primi    Poenorum exspectant, ostroque insignis et auro    stat sonipes, ac frena ferox spumantia mandit.    Tandem progreditur, magna stipante caterva,    Sidoniam picto chlamydem circumdata limbo.    Cui pharetra ex auro, crines nodantur in aurum,    aurea purpuream subnectit fibula vestem.    Nec non et Phrygii comites et laetus Iulus    incedunt.  Ipse ante alios pulcherrimus omnis    infert se socium Aeneas atque agmina iungit.    Qualis ubi hibernam Lyciam Xanthique fluenta    deserit ac Delum maternam invisit Apollo,    instauratque choros, mixtique altaria circum    Cretesque Dryopesque fremunt pictique Agathyrsi;    ipse iugis Cynthi graditur, mollique fluentem    fronde premit crinem fingens atque implicat auro;    tela sonant umeris:  haud illo segnior ibat    Aeneas; tantum egregio decus enitet ore.    Postquam altos ventum in montis atque invia lustra,    ecce ferae, saxi deiectae vertice, caprae    decurrere iugis; alia de parte patentis    transmittunt cursu campos atque agmina cervi    pulverulenta fuga glomerant montisque relinquunt.    At puer Ascanius mediis in vallibus acri    gaudet equo, iamque hos cursu, iam praeterit illos,    spumantemque dari pecora inter inertia votis    optat aprum, aut fulvum descendere monte leonem.      Interea magno misceri murmure caelum    incipit; insequitur commixta grandine nimbus;    et Tyrii comites passim et Troiana iuventus    Dardaniusque nepos Veneris diversa per agros    tecta metu petiere; ruunt de montibus amnes.    Speluncam Dido dux et Troianus eandem    deveniunt:  prima et Tellus et pronuba Iuno    dant signum; fulsere ignes et conscius aether    conubiis, summoque ulularunt vertice nymphae.    Ille dies primus leti primusque malorum    causa fuit; neque enim specie famave movetur,    nec iam furtivum Dido meditatur amorem:    coniugium vocat; hoc praetexit nomine culpam.      Extemplo Libyae magnas it Fama per urbes---    Fama, malum qua non aliud velocius ullum;    mobilitate viget, viresque adquirit eundo,    parva metu primo, mox sese attollit in auras,    ingrediturque solo, et caput inter nubila condit.    Illam Terra parens, ira inritata deorum,    extremam (ut perhibent) Coeo Enceladoque sororem    progenuit, pedibus celerem et pernicibus alis,    monstrum horrendum, ingens, cui, quot sunt corpore plumae    tot vigiles oculi subter, mirabile dictu,    tot linguae, totidem ora sonant, tot subrigit aures.    Nocte volat caeli medio terraeque per umbram,    stridens, nec dulci declinat lumina somno;    luce sedet custos aut summi culmine tecti,    turribus aut altis, et magnas territat urbes;    tam ficti pravique tenax, quam nuntia veri.    Haec tum multiplici populos sermone replebat    gaudens, et pariter facta atque infecta canebat:    venisse Aenean, Troiano sanguine cretum,    cui se pulchra viro dignetur iungere Dido;    nunc hiemem inter se luxu, quam longa, fovere    regnorum immemores turpique cupidine captos.    Haec passim dea foeda virum diffundit in ora.    Protinus ad regem cursus detorquet Iarban,    incenditque animum dictis atque aggerat iras.      Hic Hammone satus, rapta Garamantide Nympha,    templa Iovi centum latis immania regnis,    centum aras posuit, vigilemque sacraverat ignem,    excubias divom aeternas, pecudumque cruore    pingue solum et variis florentia limina sertis.
