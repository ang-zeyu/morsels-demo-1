He then came  to Hull where he entered into contracts for the delivery of 12,000 pounds  worth of timber, but only 4,000 pounds worth was ever delivered upon the  bills drawn, accepted, and paid.  Upon this transaction Bellingham was  arrested and imprisoned in Hull, where he remained seven months.  On his  release he went back to Archangel, where he had no sooner arrived than he  was again thrown into prison.  He appealed vehemently against this arrest  to the English Consul, and also to the British Ambassador at St.  Petersburg, Lord Levison Gower; but they both declined interfering, as  they considered his arrest legal and justifiable.  On his release he came  to Liverpool, whence he went to Dublin, where he met his future wife,  Miss Neville, a native of Newry.  Having become possessed of a legacy of  400 pounds, left him by his aunt, Mrs. Daw, he returned to Liverpool,  where he commenced business as an Insurance and General Broker.  He now  began memorializing the government on the subject of his claims upon  Russia.  General Gascoigne presented his petitions.  All he got was a  constant refusal of interference.  There is no doubt that some of the  wrongs he complained of were partly imaginary, and that he perhaps  inherited his father's malady.  Finding his appeals of no avail he  determined upon being revenged in some way or other upon somebody.  On  the 11th May, 1812, he posted himself, soon after five o'clock, near the  door of the lobby of the House of Commons, and as Mr. Spencer Percival  approached, he drew a pistol from his breast pocket, and fired at the  right honourable gentleman.  The shot took effect, and Mr. Percival died  almost immediately afterwards.  General Gascoigne, one of the members for  Liverpool, was one of the first to recognize the assassin, and, in fact,  seized him and took from him his pistols.  It was not thought he had any  particular enmity against Mr. Percival, but that he would have  assassinated any other of His Majesty's Ministers had they fallen in his  way at the time.  He said he had been a fortnight making up his mind to  this bloody deed.  He bought his pistols from a well-known gunmaker in  Fleet-street, and so desirous was he that they could be depended upon,  that he went to Primrose Hill, in the outskirts of London, to try them.  It was said that he had his coat altered, and a capacious and readily  accessible pocket made in it; in which pocket, in fact, the discharged  pistol was found.  Bellingham to the last maintained his contumacious and  determined character.  He justified his frightful deed, and expressed  himself resigned to his fate and prepared to meet it.  His atrocious act  caused a great sensation in the town.  The news that it had been  perpetrated, had, however, scarcely reached us in Liverpool before we  heard of his trial and execution.  He was tried on the 16th of May and  executed on the 18th.  Short shriving was then the mode!    In Suffolk-street, which runs out of Duke-street, there once dwelt a  droll person named Peter Tyrer.  He let out coaches and horses for hire.  Many funny stories were current about him.  I recollect one to the effect  that a customer of his, a gentleman residing in Duke-street, complained  several times that Peter had supplied him with a coach so stiff in the  springs as to be quite unpleasant to ride in it.  The next time a coach  was sent for by this gentleman, Peter sent him a hearse!  On being asked  his reason for so doing, his reply was that \"so many people had ridden in  that vehicle and never made any complaint, that he supposed it must be a  very comfortable conveyance.\"          CHAPTER IV.      Before I exhaust my recollections of Duke-street and its celebrities, I  ought not to omit mention of a worthy gentleman who resided in it, and  whose name occupied the attention of the public in many ways, in all  honourable to himself, as a man, a soldier, and a citizen.  I refer to  Colonel Bolton, whose mansion in Duke-street, between Suffolk-street and  Kent-street (called after, and by Mr. Kent, who lived at the corner of  the street, and who also named the streets adjacent after the southern  counties), was in bye-gone years the head-quarters of the Tory party in  Liverpool, in election times.  From the balcony of that house, wherein  the utmost hospitality was always exercised, the great statesmen who have  represented Liverpool in Parliament--George Canning and William  Huskisson--have many a time poured forth the floods of their eloquence,  stirring up the heart's-blood of the thousands assembled in the street to  hear them, making pulses beat quicker, and exciting passions to  fever-heat.  Mr. Canning used also to address the electors from Sir  Thomas Brancker's house in Rodney-street.    The lengths to which election zeal carried men may be understood, when,  during the progress of an election, business was suspended in the town  for days and days.  Hatred, envy, and malice were engendered.  Neighbour  was set against neighbour, and I have known many instances where serious  divisions in families have taken place when opposite sides in politics  have been chosen by the members of such families.  It has required years  to heal wounds made in family circles, and time in some instances never  succeeded in bringing relatives to esteem each other again.  The small  knot of reformers in this town stuck manfully together and fought their  battles well; and if the Tory side could boast of substantial names  amongst their ranks, those of Henry Brougham, Egerton Smith, Dr.  Shepherd, Mr. Mulock, Edward Rushton, and many others, occupy a place in  the pantheon of worthies who stood forward on all great and public  occasions when improvement in the constitution was to be advocated.  I  recollect a time when it was scarcely wise for a man to confess himself a  reformer.  At the beginning of this century, when the horrors of the  French Revolution were fresh in all men's minds, and knowing so well as  we did that there were many mischievous, dangerous, and disaffected  people amongst us, ripe and ready to foment and foster broils, bringing  anarchy and confusion in their train, it seemed to be the duty of all men  who had characters and property to lose, to stick fast to the state as it  was, without daring to change anything, however trifling or however  necessary.  A man was almost thought a traitor to talk of reform or  change at one time, for there were not a few influential men who would  rather have risen on the ruins of Old England than have fallen with her  glory.  Ticklish times we had in the beginning of the present century.    On the subject of Reform, it was said that an elector one day meeting Mr.  Brougham in Castle-street, thus accosted him:--\"Well, Mister, so you are  going to try for Reform again?\"  \"Yes,\" said the great orator, \"and I  hope we shall get it.\"  Elector:--\"Very good, Mister, we really do want a  reform in parliament, for I think it is a very hard thing that a man can  only get a paltry 5 or 10 pounds for his vote.  There ought to be some  fixed sum--certainly not less than 25 pounds.\"    One of the most remarkable election events that has taken place in  Liverpool was that in which Messrs. Ewart and Denison were engaged in  1830.  Remarkable not only for the vigour with which it was carried on,  but for the intense excitement that it created, the number of days it  occupied, and also for the enormous sums of money it cost.  The bribery  that took place on both sides and all sides was really frightful.  It was  a positive disgrace to humanity.  The contest was continued for seven  days.  While it was carried on business in the town was partly suspended,  and all men's thoughts, and acts, and interests, seemed engrossed by the  one prevailing subject.  On the death of Mr. Huskisson, those interested  in political matters set about to look for a successor to represent their  interests in parliament.  Several distinguished gentlemen were invited to  stand; amongst others were Sir Robert Peel, and the Right Hon. Charles  Grant, both of whom, however, declined the honour.  Mr. Grant had had  enough of an election contest to last him for some time, his success at  Inverness had only been won by too hard fighting to be lightly thought  of; while Sir Robert Peel freely confessed that the duties of Home  Secretary were such as to prevent him from devoting sufficient time to  the interests of so large and important a constituency as that of  Liverpool.    By the way, I recollect a rather curious anecdote of Mr. Huskisson, which  may perhaps not be devoid of interest.  About 1834 I was dining on board  one of the beautiful American sailing-packets, the _George Washington_.  It was only a small party, and amongst others present was the late Sir  George Drinkwater, who related the following curious circumstance  connected with Mr. Huskisson:--Sir George told us that the day before the  lamentable occurrence took place, which deprived this town of a valuable  representative, and the country of so distinguished a statesman, Mr.  Huskisson called upon him at the Town Hall (Sir George being then Mayor),  and asked permission to write a letter.  While doing so an announcement  was made that there was a deputation from Hyde, near Manchester, wishing  to see Mr. Huskisson.  \"Oh!\" said that gentleman, \"I know what they want;  but I will send them back to Hyde with a flea in their ears!\"  The  gentlemen of the deputation having been ushered into the room, they  stated their case, to the effect that they solicited Mr. Huskisson to  support a petition in parliament to enable them to construct a railway  between their town and Manchester.  They had no sooner stated their  errand than Mr. Huskisson, angrily throwing down his pen, in very few  words refused their request, winding up his reply with these memorable  words--remarkable not only"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21359"],[0,"Off to the Wilds: Being the Adventures of Two Brothers (#12)"],[1,"about not losing  his way, but to impress the land-marks upon his memory, so as to  recognise them if he went astray.    As he disappeared down the valley side of the slope, Mr Rogers turned  to Jack.    \"Well, my boy, would you like a try as well?\"    Jack's whole face, as well as his tongue, said yes, and Mr Rogers  smilingly pointed down into the valley, in the other direction.    \"Be careful,\" he said, \"and don't fire either in our direction or in  your brother's, for a rifle-bullet flies far.\"    \"All right, father,\" cried Jack; and he too crept down the slope from  bush to bush, to try and stalk one of the bok that came nearest to the  clump of wood upon his right.    \"So this is the game country?\" said Mr Rogers.    \"Yes, boss, this the game country, but only bit outside.  I show you big  game yet--elephant, lion, all the big animal, only wait.\"    Mr Rogers was ready to set self aside in every way in his efforts to  educate his sons, so he took out his glass and sat down beside the  General, watching the various herds of wild animals in the glowing  morning light, and thinking how grateful he ought to be to see his boys  daily growing in health, strength, and confidence.  For it was  unmistakable; Dick, the weak, half-consumptive lad, was altering  rapidly, and the anxious father's heart rejoiced as the dark shadow that  had hovered over his life seemed to be chased away.    As he sat there thinking, and bringing his glass to bear upon the  various herds, while waiting for them to take the alarm, he could not  help feeling that Dick and Jack were managing uncommonly well to have  gone on so long without alarming the game.  It showed thoughtfulness,  and ability in the hunter's craft; not, of course, that he wished them  to turn out hunters, but he believed in thoroughness, and he used to say  that if it was only play it ought to be done well.    He was letting the glass rest upon his knees, with his eyes running  dreamily over the landscape, when he became aware of the fact that the  Zulu was watching him intently, as he sat there with a couple of  assegais across his knees.    \"I am sorry I was so unjust to him that night,\" thought Mr Rogers.  \"It  is a pity one's nature prompts one to be so hasty and suspicious.\"    Then as his eyes met those of the General, as it was fast becoming the  custom to call him, he cudgelled his brains for some way of showing his  confidence in him, who was so completely their guide.    Suddenly a soft smile beamed on the Zulu's fierce countenance, and he  said gently,--    \"Boss thinking about his boys.  Fine brave boys; make big warriors and  chiefs.  Zulu wish his boys here too.  Love his boys same as white man.\"    Mr Rogers stretched out his hand to the Zulu on the instant, for he had  touched the chord of their common humanity, and white man and black man,  as their hands joined in one firm grip, felt that henceforth they would  be friends who could trust each other to the end.    \"Look!\" cried the Zulu suddenly; and he pointed down into the plain,  where the alarm had been taken in the direction taken by Dick.    Antelopes that had been feeding, suddenly threw up their heads and  galloped together, seeming to form square--first with horns outward to  resist attack; then they reformed, and charged in one direction; halted,  turned, and charged in another--as if alarmed, and yet not knowing which  way to go.    The wildebeestes that had been fighting stopped, erected their tails,  pawed the ground, and then, throwing their heads side-wise, began to  plough it with one horn, but only to snort loudly and tear over the  plain; while the zebras and quaggas began to toss their heads and tear  about over the grassy wild, kicking and plunging, and scattering the  light antelopes like the wind.    Suddenly there was a puff of smoke from a clump of bushes quite a mile  away, and after an interval the faint crack of a rifle.    \"That's Dick's gun, General,\" said Mr Rogers, bringing his glass to  bear upon a little herd of antelopes that must have formed the object of  the shot; but not one of them fell, neither did either of them seem to  be lamed.    \"Miss, this time,\" said the General, quietly.    Just then there was another report, evidently a shot at long range; but  the only effect was to drive the game more in the direction of Jack's  position, or what they supposed to be Jack's position.    Seeing then that Dick was not likely to get another shot, Mr Rogers  turned his glass in the other direction; but there was nothing to see  but the great herds of game, going more and more towards a clump of  timber--trees that were of glorious shades of green in the morning sun.  But, all at once, as a troop of gnus were trotting by, three or four  large birds came rushing out, as if alarmed, and the gnus took fright,  tearing off at a frantic pace.  But before they had gone far there was a  white puff of smoke from the end of the clump.    \"Well done!\" cried Mr Rogers.  \"He did well to get so far.  But it is  another miss.  We must not depend on the boys yet for our dinners.\"    The whole plain seemed to be now alive, and herd after herd of game,  that had been hidden from them by the trees, had rushed into sight, and  was now careering onward, and away from the dangerous proximity to the  woods.    \"Poor boys!  All their trouble for nothing,\" said Mr Rogers, closing  his glass.  \"I wish I had gone too.  I might have hit something.\"    \"Boss Jack has hit,\" said the Zulu, pointing.    And just then, to the father's great delight, he saw one of the curious  antelopes suddenly stop short, the rest of the herd galloping onwards.  Then it shook its head, turned, and seemed giddily to gallop back, and  finally fell dead.    Almost at the same moment they saw Jack run out from the clump of  timber, gun in one hand, cap in the other, which latter he began to wave  frantically above his head.    \"Well done, boy!  A good shot,\" cried Mr Rogers.  \"Ah, there's Dick.\"    For Dick now showed himself, a mile away to the left, and began to cross  the open to join his brother, whose success he must have seen.    \"The next thing is to get the game home,\" said Mr Rogers.  \"We'll go  back, and send Peter and Dirk.\"    He placed a shrill little whistle to his lips as he spoke, and as its  piercing note rang out, the boys, who had been making for the fallen  gnu, turned to come back.    \"I'll go!\" said the General.  \"Mustn't leave the game.  Look, boss.\"    He pointed, and in the distance there was a great vulture winging its  way towards the fallen gnu; and, directly after, another and another  came into sight, sailing heavily along upon its great dusky flapping  wings.    It seemed as if telegrams had been sent in all directions to the  vultures' roosting-places that there had been a wildebeeste slain; and  it was so evident that, if steps were not taken to save it, the vultures  would destroy the provisions of three or four days, that Mr Rogers  rapidly blew twice upon his whistle--a preconcerted signal, which made  the boys turn and go towards the game.    As it was, a vulture would have reached the fallen animal before them  but for a shot from Dick's gun, which had the effect of more than  scaring it as it was just alighting, for, evidently hit by the bullet,  it flew a few yards, and then fell, flapping its wings for a few  moments, and then lay still.    This checked the others for the time, and Mr Rogers waited till the  General should set the boys at liberty, when he meant to return to the  waggon.        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    GETTING INTO WORK.    It seemed some little time before the Zulu appeared at the bottom of the  slope; but when he emerged from the woods, Mr Rogers could see that he  had been cutting some sticks, and on bringing the glass to bear he made  out that the Zulu was straightening them as he ran.    The boys saw him coming, and waved their caps; while, when the General  joined them, they all bent over the game together, the Zulu apparently  being very busy, and making Mr Rogers impatient, for he wanted to get  back to breakfast, which must then be ready.    \"There is some reason for it, I dare say,\" said Mr Rogers, gazing  through his glass.  \"Why, they are all coming away!  The animal will be  devoured.  It is bad, perhaps.\"    He waited patiently, seeing the little party return; and as they left  the fallen gnu he saw the vultures come dropping down from the trees  where they had been waiting, till there were over twenty by the game,  round which they formed a circle, but they did not approach near.    \"Strange!\" thought Mr Rogers.  \"I wonder they don't tear it up.  Perhaps it is still alive.  If so they ought to have put the poor thing  out of its misery.  I shall speak sharply to Master Dick about such  wanton cruelty.\"    Mr Rogers wanted his breakfast, and, as he had had no excitement, he  felt cross, so that it seemed as if the boys would get what Jack  irreverently called a wigging.  But the sight of his sons' bright  excited faces as they ran up the slope, drove away his ill-humour.    \"Why, Dick!\" he cried, \"how you run!\"    \"Do I, father?\" cried the boy, excitedly, \"But did you see what a  splendid shot Jack made?  I missed twice, but he brought his gnu down.  It's a fine young bull.\"    \"Then you are not jealous of his luck?\" said his father.    \"Oh, no,\" laughed Dick.  \"It will be my turn next time.\"    \"Bravo, Jack!\" cried Mr Rogers.  \"But why did you leave the game to the  vultures?  Dick says it was a fine young bull.\"    \"Oh, it's all right, father,\" cried Jack, who now ran panting up to his  father's side.  \"The General has cut it up partly, and has brought the  liver and kidneys, and a bit or two to cook for breakfast.\"    \"But it was a pity to leave so much good meat, my boys; I don't like  wanton waste.\"    \"But it's all right, father,\" said Dick.  \"The General has stuck some  pieces of wood round and over it, and he says the vultures won't go near  it"]]]
