And thus the king's ancestors, who have bequeathed the  crown to him, call from their graves: 'With it, or buried under it!' It  is the inheritance of his fathers, which he must leave to his children;  he must fight for it, and either triumph or perish with it. That is the  reason why I weep, and see nothing but years of disaster and bloodshed  in store for me. Prussia must not make peace with Napoleon; she must  not, in hypocritical friendship, give her hand to him who is her mortal  enemy. She must remain faithful to the alliance which her king has sworn  on the coffin of Frederick the Great to maintain; and France will resent  this constancy as though it were a crime. But, in spite of her anger, we  must not recede; we must advance on our path if we do not wish to lose  also our honor, and if history is not to mention the name of Frederick  William III. in terms of reproach. Germany hopes that Prussia will save  her--the whole of Europe expects us to do our duty to the fatherland,  and this duty is to wage war against the tyrant who wants to subjugate  Germany, and transform her into a French province--to resist him as long  as we have an inch of territory or a drop of blood in our veins! See, my  friends, such are the thoughts that move my heart so profoundly, and  cause me to weep. I clearly foresee the great misfortunes that will  crush us in case we should proceed on the path which we have entered,  but I am not allowed to wish that Prussia should turn back, for we may  be permitted to be unfortunate, but never to act dishonorably. And I  know these to be the king's views, too--he--but hark, what is that?\" she  interrupted herself. \"Did it not sound as if a noisy crowd were  approaching? The tumult draws nearer and nearer! If they are French  soldiers, I am lost!\" She rushed to the window, and looked anxiously  down on the street. A vast multitude approached, yelling with rage, and  threatening with their hands a pale, trembling man walking between two  others who had seized him, and whose eyes closely watched every motion  he made. That man was Cabinet-Counsellor Lombard, who, on his escape  from Berlin, had safely reached Stettin.    Just as he was about entering his carriage, in order to leave the latter  city, a few of the bystanders recognized and detained him. Those who  were in the streets soon gathered around and curiously looked on during  his altercation with the men who had stopped him.    Suddenly one of them turned to the crowd and exclaimed in a loud voice:  \"Do not permit this fellow to depart. It is Lombard, the Frenchman, the  traitor; he has assuredly come to Stettin in order to prevent the queen  from continuing her journey, or to inform the enemy whither she is  going. Let us arrest him, that he may not betray her!\"    \"Yes, yes, arrest him; do not release him until long after the queen's  departure,\" cried the people. Threatening men surrounded the traitor on  all sides, and anxiously scanned his pale, cowardly face.    \"Let me go, kind friends, let me go!\" begged Lombard, and now all his  arrogance and haughtiness had disappeared. \"You do me the greatest  injustice; I am a faithful servant of the king, and have come to Stettin  in order to wait on her majesty, and to offer my services to her.\"    \"He lies! he lies!\" said those who had recognized him. \"Let us go with  him to the royal villa; the queen is there. If she wants to see him, she  will order him to be admitted; if not, he shall witness her departure.\"    \"Yes, he shall witness her departure,\" exclaimed the rest approvingly;  \"let us go to the royal villa!\"    Dragged, pushed, and carried along, Lombard arrived, followed by  thousands, at the royal residence, which was situated at the lower end  of Broad Street, near the parade-grounds.    The carriage and horses stood in front of the house, and every thing was  ready for the queen's departure. But Louisa was still at the window, and  looked from behind the curtains down on the vast mass which filled the  whole street. Suddenly she uttered a low cry; and hastily placing her  hand on her friend's shoulder, she pointed to the street. \"Look,\" she  whispered, trembling, \"look! there is the evil demon who has done so  much to bring about the present calamities of our country; it is  Lombard, my most dangerous, nay, I must say, my only enemy! He hates me,  because he knows that I distrusted him, and asked the king for his  dismission. He has dealt treacherously with Prussia--I know and feel it,  and felt convinced of it long before this time. The presence of this man  proves that some new calamity is menacing me, for he is plotting my  ruin. I wonder what brought him here?\"    \"Let me go!\" cried Lombard just then, in a loud and ringing voice. \"Let  me go! I will and must see the queen!\"    \"See me?\" said Louisa, in terror. \"No, I will not see him; I have  nothing to do with him.\"    In her excitement, and anxious to see what would occur, she came forth  from behind the curtain, and appeared in full view at the window. The  people greeted her with loud cheers, and then turned their eyes again  toward Lombard. He had also seen her, and now raised his hands in a  suppliant manner, saying: \"Oh, I beseech your majesty, call me up to  your room! I have come to offer my services and to communicate important  news. Grant me an audience!\"    But she did not stir; she had apparently not heard his words, and her  eyes, usually so gentle, now looked gloomy and angry.    \"The queen does not call him!\" exclaimed hundreds of voices on the  street. \"She does not want to have any thing to do with him! He is a  traitor.\"    \"What have I done, then, kind friends, that you should call me a  traitor?\" asked Lombard. \"State the crimes you charge me with, so that I  may justify myself!\"    \"We will state them to you!\" said the men who had detained him and who  were wealthy and highly-esteemed merchants of Stettin.    \"Yes, yes, Mr. Grunert, and Mr. Pufahl, state his crimes to him, and  prove to him that he is a traitor!\"    \"We will; be quiet and listen!\" replied Mr. Grunert.    \"The people are going to sit in solemn judgment over him,\" whispered the  queen; \"they will ferret out his crimes and punish him for them!\"    Breathless silence reigned now. A chair was brought from one of the  adjoining houses, and Lombard compelled to mount on it, so that every  one might be able to see him. It was a strange sight, that of his  tottering, feeble form, with a pale and terror-stricken face, rising  above the crowd, whose eyes were all turned toward him, and who cast  glances like daggers at him.    \"He is a traitor, and I will prove it to him,\" repeated Mr. Grunert,  closely approaching Lombard. \"In 1803, when the king sent him to  Brussels to negotiate with Bonaparte, about an honorable peace between  Prussia and France, he allowed himself to be bribed. He exercised an  influence humiliating and disadvantageous to us; but Bonaparte bribed  him by paying him the sum of six thousand _Napoleons d'or_. Deny it if  you can!\"    \"I deny it,\" replied Lombard. \"It is true, I suffered myself to be duped  by that monster for a moment. When I saw Bonaparte in 1803 in Brussels,  he managed to inspire me with confidence in his magnanimity and  greatness of character. But the deception did not last long, and soon I  perceived that this incarnate fiend would not stop in his career until  he had destroyed all existing thrones and states.[11] But I deny ever  having received money from him--I deny ever having accepted any  presents from him. And the best proof of it is that I have not any  property whatever, but I am as poor as a church mouse. My wife has  scarcely a decent parlor for the reception of her friends; and as for  myself, a plain arm-chair and a tobacco-pipe were always the goal of my  wishes.\"    [Footnote 11: Lombard's own words.--Vide Gentz's \"Miscellanies,\" vol.  ii., p. 194.]    \"You are poor, because you squander at the gaming-table and in secret  orgies what you obtain by your intrigues,\" said Grunert, sternly. \"Your  poverty does not absolve you, for it is the direct consequence of your  dissipated life. You are a traitor. It was owing to your machinations in  the interest of Napoleon that our army, last year, when it ought to have  taken the field with the Austrian and Russian forces against France, was  placed so late on the war-footing, and finally returned to its garrisons  without having drawn the sword. You are to blame for the disgraceful  treaty of Vienna, for Count Haugwitz is merely a tool in your hands. You  rule over him. You laughed and rejoiced when the treaty of Vienna had  been concluded, for you are a descendant of the French colony of Berlin,  and you have no heart for the honor of Germany and Prussia.\"    \"He is a traitor!\" cried the people; \"do not let him go! Detain him! He  shall not betray the queen!\"    The crowd approached Lombard in the most menacing manner, and were about  to drag him from his chair, but Grunert and Pufahl warded them off, and  protected him with their broad and vigorous bodies.    \"You do not yet know all he has done,\" exclaimed Mr. Pufahl, in a  powerful voice. \"I will tell you about the last and most infamous  instance of his treachery. It is his fault that we lost the battle of  Jena--his fault alone.\"    \"What am I to hear?\" whispered Louisa.    Perfectly beside herself, she approached closer to the window, and  listened in breathless suspense to every word that was uttered.    \"Well, let me tell you what Lombard has done,\" added Mr. Pufahl. \"In the  middle of last month our king sent Lieutenant-Colonel von Krusemark with  an autograph letter to St. Petersburg, in which he informed the czar  that he intended to declare war against France, and requested the latter  to send him the assistance that had been agreed upon between"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19564"],[0,"The Pirates' Who's Who (#12)"],[1,"if  chequered career.      BURGESS, CAPTAIN THOMAS.    One of the pirates of the Bahama Islands who surrendered to King George in  1718 and received the royal pardon. He was afterwards drowned at sea.      BURK, CAPTAIN.    An Irishman, who committed many piracies on the coast of Newfoundland.  Drowned in the Atlantic during a hurricane in 1699.      CACHEMAREE, CAPTAIN. French filibuster.    Commanded the _St. Joseph_, of six guns and a crew of seventy men. In 1684  had his headquarters at San Domingo.      CAESAR.    A negro. One of Teach's crew hanged at Virginia in 1718. Caesar, who was  much liked and trusted by Blackbeard, had orders from him to blow up the  _Queen Ann's Revenge_ by dropping a lighted match into the powder magazine  in case the ship was taken by Lieutenant Maynard. Caesar attempted to carry  out his instructions, but was prevented from doing so by two of the  surrendered pirates.      CAESAR, CAPTAIN.    One of Gasparilla's gang of pirates who hunted in the Gulf of Mexico. His  headquarters were on Sanibel Island.      CALLES, CAPTAIN JOHN, or CALLIS.    A notorious Elizabethan pirate, whose activities were concentrated on the  coast of Wales.    We quote Captain John Smith, the founder of Virginia, who writes: \"This  Ancient pirate Callis, who most refreshed himselfe upon the Coast of  Wales, who grew famous, till Queene Elizabeth of Blessed Memory, hanged  him at Wapping.\"    Calles did not die on the gallows without an attempt at getting let off.  He wrote a long and ingenious letter to Lord Walsyngham, bewailing his  former wicked life and promising, if spared, to assist in ridding the  coast of pirates by giving particulars of \"their roads, haunts, creeks,  and maintainers.\" One of the chief of these \"maintainers,\" or receivers of  stolen property, was Lord O'Sullivan, or the Sulivan Bere of Berehaven.  In spite of a long and very plausible plea for pity, this \"ancient and  wicked pyrate\" met his fate on the gibbet at Wapping.      CAMMOCK, WILLIAM.    A seaman under Captain Bartholomew Sharp. He died at sea on December 14th,  1679, off the coast of Chile. \"His disease was occasioned by a sunfit,  gained by too much drinking on shore at La Serena; which produced in him a  _celenture_, or malignant fever and a hiccough.\" He was buried at sea with  the usual honours of \"three French vollies.\"      CANDOR, RALPH.    Tried for piracy with the rest of Captain Lowther's crew at St. Kitts in  March, 1723, and acquitted.      CANNIS, _alias_ CANNIS MARCY.    A Dutch pirate who acted as interpreter to Captain Bartholomew Sharp's  South Sea Expedition. Captain Cox and Basil Ringmore took him with them  after the sacking of Hilo in 1679, to come to terms with the Spanish  cavalry over the ransoming of a sugar mill. On Friday, May 27th, 1680,  while ashore with a watering party in the Gulf of Nicoya, the interpreter,  having had, no doubt, his fill of buccaneering, ran away.      CARACCIOLI, SIGNOR, _alias_ D'AUBIGNY.    An Italian renegade priest, who became an atheist, Socialist, and  revolutionist, and was living at Naples when Captain Fourbin arrived there  in the French man-of-war _Victoire_.    Caraccioli met and made great friends with a young French apprentice in  the ship, called Misson, and a place was found for him on board. The  ex-priest proved himself to be a brave man in several engagements with  the Moors and with an English warship, and was quickly promoted to be a  petty officer.    Caraccioli, by his eloquence, soon converted most of the crew to believe  in his theories, and when Captain Fourbin was killed in an action off  Martinique with an English ship, Misson took command and appointed the  Italian to be his Lieutenant, and continued to fight the English ship to a  finish. The victorious crew then elected Misson to be their captain, and  decided to \"bid defiance to all nations\" and to settle on some  out-of-the-way island. Capturing another English ship off the Cape of Good  Hope, Caraccioli was put in command of her, and the whole of the English  crew voluntarily joined the pirates, and sailed to Madagascar. Here they  settled, and the Italian married the daughter of a black Island King; an  ideal republic was formed, and our hero was appointed Secretary of State.    Eventually Caraccioli died fighting during a sudden attack made on the  settlement by a neighbouring tribe.      CARMAN, THOMAS.    Of Maidstone in Kent.    Hanged at Charleston in 1718 with the rest of Major Bonnet's crew.      CARNES, JOHN.    One of Blackbeard's crew. Hanged at Virginia in 1718.      CARR, JOHN.    A Massachusetts pirate, one of Hore's crew, who was hiding in Rhode Island  in 1699.      CARTER, DENNIS.    Tried for piracy in June, 1704, at the Star Tavern in Boston. One of John  Quelch's crew.      CARTER, JOHN.    Captured by Major Sewall in the _Larimore_ galley, and brought into Salem.  One of Captain Quelch's crew. Tried at Boston in 1704.      CASTILLO.    A Columbian sailor in the schooner _Panda_. Hanged for piracy at Boston on  June 11th, 1835.      LA CATA.    A most blood-thirsty pirate and one of the last of the West Indian gangs.    In 1824, when La Cata was cruising off the Isle of Pines, his ship was  attacked by an English cutter only half his size. After a furious fight  the cutter was victorious, and returned in triumph to Jamaica with the  three survivors of the pirates as prisoners. One of these was found out at  the trial to be La Cata himself. Hanged at Kingston, Jamaica.      CHANDLER, HENRY, _alias_ RAMMETHAM RISE.    Born in Devonshire, his father kept a chandler's shop in Southwark. An  English _renegado_ at Algiers, who had turned Mohammedan and had become an  overseer in the pirates' shipyards. He was a man of some authority amongst  the Moors, and in 1621 he appointed a slave called Goodale to become  master of one of the pirate ships, the _Exchange_, in which one Rawlins  also sailed. Owing to the courage and ingenuity of the latter, the  European slaves afterwards seized the ship and brought her into Plymouth;  Chandler being thrown into gaol and afterwards hanged.      CHEESMAN, EDWARD.    Taken prisoner out of the _Dolphin_, on the Banks of Newfoundland, by the  Pirate Phillips in 1724. With the help of a fisherman called Fillmore, he  killed Phillips and ten other pirates and brought the ship into Boston  Harbour.      CHEVALLE, DANIEL.    One of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy at Boston in 1704.      CHILD, THOMAS.    In the year 1723, at the age of 15, he was tried for piracy at Newport,  Rhode Island. This child must have seen scores of cold-blooded murders  committed while he sailed with Low and Harris. Found to be not guilty.      CHRISTIAN, CAPTAIN.    In 1702 the town of Tolu was sacked by Captain Brown of the _Blessing_.  Brown was killed, and Christian was elected to be captain in his stead.  Davis tells us that \"Christian was an old experienced soldier and  privateer, very brave and just in all his actions.\" He had lived for a  long while amongst the Darien Indians, with whom he was on very friendly  terms.      CHULY, DANIEL.    Tried for piracy at Boston, Massachusetts, in 1706.      CHURCH, CHARLES.    Of St. Margaret's, Westminster.    One of Captain Charles Harris's crew. Hanged on July 19th, 1723, at  Newport, Rhode Island. Age      CHURCH, EDWARD.    In 1830 he served in the brig _Vineyard_, from New Orleans to  Philadelphia. Took part in the mutiny which was planned by the notorious  pirate Charles Gibbs.      CHURCH, WILLIAM.    Of the _Gertrwycht_ of Holland.    At the trial at West Africa in 1722 of the crew of Bartholomew Roberts's,  four of the prisoners--W. Church, Phil. Haak, James White, and Nicholas  Brattle--were proved to have \"served as Musick on board the _Royal  Fortune_, being taken out of several merchant ships, having had an uneasy  life of it, having sometimes their Fiddles, and often their Heads broke,  only for excusing themselves, as saying they were tired, when any Fellow  took it in his Head to demand a Tune.\" Acquitted.      CHURCHILL, JOHN.    One of Captain George Lowther's crew. Captured by the _Eagle_ sloop at the  Island of Blanco, not far from Tortuga.    Hanged on March 11th, 1722, at St. Kitts.      CLARKE, JONATHAN.    Of Charleston, South Carolina.    One of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried for piracy at Charleston in 1718,  and found to be not guilty.      CLARKE, RICHARD, _alias_ JAFAR.    A renegade English sailor, who turned \"Turk\"--that is, became a  Mohammedan--and was appointed chief gunner on one of the Barbary pirate  ships. Captured in the _Exchange_, and brought into Plymouth in 1622. He  was hanged.      CLARKE, ROBERT.    Governor of New Providence, Bahama Islands. Instead of trying to stamp out  the pirates, he did all he could to encourage them, by granting letters of  marque to such men as Coxon, to go privateering, these letters being quite  illegal. The proprietors of the Bahama Islands turned Clarke out and  appointed in his place Robert Lilburne in 1682.      CLIFFORD, JOHN.    One of Captain John Quelch's crew; tried at the Star Tavern at Boston in  1704 for piracy. All the accused pleaded \"Not guilty\" except Clifford and  two others who turned Queen's evidence.      CLINTON, CAPTAIN.    One of the notorious sixteenth century pirates \"who grew famous until  Queene Elizabeth of blessed memory, hanged them at Wapping.\"      COBHAM, CAPTAIN.    Of Poole in Dorsetshire.    At the age of 18 he took to smuggling. His biographer tells us that even  at this comparatively early age Cobham \"was cautious and prudent, and  though he intrigued with the ladies, he managed to keep it secret.\" Cobham  was very successful as a smuggler, on one occasion landing a cargo of ten  thousand gallons of brandy at Poole. But a little later on his vessel was  captured by a King's cutter. This annoyed the young captain, and he bought  a cutter at Bridport, mounted fourteen guns in her, and"]]]
