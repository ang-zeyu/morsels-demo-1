Evil he was in moral character without doubt, but a  glorious builder nevertheless. Though he oppressed the clergy, though it  was through his instrumentality and by his advice that sees were kept  vacant for years, and when filled, only given to those who were able and  willing to pay large sums to the king, yet it is rather as a great  architect than as an ecclesiastic that we, who gaze with delight and  admiration on his work that has come down to us, will regard him. It is  said that, as his end drew nigh, he realised the amount of evil he had  done, and strove to make his peace with heaven and restitution to some,  at least, of those whom he had wronged. He died in 1128, and his body  rests in the great Cathedral Church of St Cuthbert that he had done so  much to raise. But it was in the earlier part of his career, before  he received the bishopric of Durham in 1099, that he probably began  the work at Christchurch with which we are at present concerned.[4]  He was succeeded there by Godric, who is called Senior and Patron  and afterwards Dean; but Flambard seems still to have exercised some  authority over him, illegal probably, but none the less real. We find  him granting to Godric, for the work of building, all the offerings  made by strangers and pilgrims, and when a canon died his share of the  revenues of the college was devoted to the same object, the vacancy not  being filled up by the appointment of any new canon.        [4] Sir Gilbert Scott, however, thought that the Norman nave of          the Cathedral Church at Durham was commenced before Flambard          became bishop, and that the new church at Christchurch was          begun after that date, so that the work at Christchurch was          copied by him from what he found already commenced at Durham          when he went there.    The length of Godric's tenure of office is uncertain. On his death Henry  I. appointed Gilbert de Dousgunels dean, having appropriated to himself  the accumulated fabric fund. Henry I. granted the patronage of the  church to Richard de Redvers, Earl of Devon, who appointed his chaplain,  Peter, a Norman of Caen, dean. This dean seems to have diverted the  funds from the work of completing the church, but his successor,  Randulphus, carried on the work again, so that in his time the church  and the conventual buildings were roofed in. In the time of Hilary, in  the year 1150, the secular college of canons was converted into a Priory  of Augustinian Canons. This change was made with the consent of Baldwin  de Redvers, in accordance with the wishes of Henry of Blois, brother of  King Stephen, and at that time Bishop of Winchester, who is well known  from the fact of his founding the Hospital of St Cross, near Winchester.  Hilary, two years before this change was made, had been consecrated  Bishop of Chichester, and subsequently became one of the episcopal  opponents of Thomas Becket. Henceforth, until the dissolution in the  reign of Henry VIII., the head of the religious community at  Christchurch was a prior, who was, according to a charter granted by  Richard de Redvers in 1160, elected by the canons. There were, in all,  twenty-six priors, and their names have come down to us, but with only  the most meagre notices of the architectural work which was carried on  by each of them. Extensive, however, it must have been; and from what we  see of the church itself, it would seem as if building operations must  have been almost constantly in progress.    In all probability there was, according to the usual plan of Norman  churches, a tower at the junction of the nave and transepts, and beyond  this an apsidal choir. But there is no documentary record of such a  tower ever having been built or fallen, although its existence is  rendered probable by a carving of a church with tower and spire on  Draper's chantry, and by a similar representation on a seal, and in  two other parts of the building. It is probable that the original  choir extended westward beyond the transept, as at Westminster to the  present day.    As has been stated above, the Norman church was commenced by Flambard  towards the end of the eleventh century; and of the work so begun, the  earliest existing remains are the arcading of the nave, the triforium,  and the transepts with the eastern apsidal chapel attached to the south  transept. Next to this in order came the walls of the aisles of the  nave, and the cloisters and chapter-house, which, however, have  disappeared; cloisters would come to be considered a necessity as soon  as the secular canons were superseded by regulars. The early English  clerestory of the nave seems to have been built in the time of the third  prior, Peter, about the beginning of the thirteenth century. To the end  of same century may be approximately assigned the vaulting of the nave  aisles, the north porch, and a chapel attached to the north transept.  Alterations of an extensive nature seem to have been begun in the  fourteenth century; for to this date belong the rood screen, placed  farther to the east than the old division between the ritual choir of  the canons and the western part of the nave, which was probably given up  to the lay dwellers in the parish,--and the splendid reredos. The Lady  Chapel also was completed certainly before 1406, probably eleven years  earlier. The fifteenth century saw the western tower built and the choir  commenced and a great part of it finished, though the vaulting seems not  to have been completed until the early part of the sixteenth century, as  W. E. the initials of William Eyre, who was prior from 1502 to 1520, are  to be seen on the bosses and the arch of the south choir aisle. Somewhat  later still is the chantry at the east end of the south choir aisle,  built by the last prior and dated 1529, and the chantry built by the  last of the Plantagenets, Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, daughter of  the Earl of Clarence and mother of Cardinal Pole, who at the age of  seventy was executed by Henry VIII. in 1541.    Shortly before the dissolution in 1536 Prior Draper addressed a  petition to Henry VIII. which is still in existence in the Record  Office, praying that he would spare the Priory church, basing his  request upon the desolate character of the district, the poverty of  the house, and the fact that the church was not only a place for poor  religious men, but also a parish church to the town and hamlets round  about, whose inhabitants numbered from fifteen to sixteen hundred, that  there was no place where any honest man on horseback or on foot might  have succour or repose for the space of eight or nine miles, \"but only  this poor place of Christchurch, to which both rich and poor doth repair  and repose.\" He goes on to say how it was of late years a place of  secular canons, until the king's antecessors made it a place of canons  regular, that \"the poor, not only of the parish and town, but also of  the country, were daily relieved and sustained with bread and ale,  purposely baked and brewed for them weekly to no small quantities  according to their foundation, and a house ordained purposely for  them, and officers according duly given attendance to serve them  to their great comfort and relief.\" But all the pleading was in vain.  Commissioners were appointed, who presented their report to Lord  Cromwell December 2, 1539. They say that \"we found the Prior a very  honest and conformable person, and the house well furnished with jewels  and plate, whereof some be meet for the king's majesty's use.\" Then  follows a list of the treasures of the abbey, of the yearly value of  the several endowments, and of the officers of the Priory, thirteen in  number besides the Prior. Prior Draper retired on a pension, and the  site of the domestic buildings was conveyed to Stephen and Margaret  Kirton. The domestic buildings themselves gradually disappeared, but the  whole of the church was handed over to the parish as a church, the grant  to the churchwardens being made by letters patent 23 October 32 Henry  VIII. It conveyed to them \"the choir body, bell-tower with seven bells,  stones, timber, lead of roofing and gutters of the church and the  cemetery on the north side.\" Since then the church has been served by  vicars, the patronage being in the hands of the dean and chapter of  Winchester until the nineteenth century, when the advowson was purchased  by Lord Malmesbury. The living is now in the gift of the Bishop of  Winchester.    During the present century much restoration has been done. The nave was  vaulted in stucco in 1819; the west window was taken in hand in 1828;  the pinnacles of the tower and the upper part of the turret containing  the stairs were renewed in 1871; and constant repairs have been going on  up to the present time; and the principle that has guided the restorer  has been, when any stonework has been removed to put in its place as  exact a copy of the old as possible,--a principle that cannot be  approved of, as it will lead, when the newness of the modern work has  been toned down by time, to confusion between the genuine old work and  the modern imitation of it. It is far better, when there is no question  of stability but only of appearance, to leave the old stonework, even  though much decayed, as it is, unscraped, untouched by the chisel, and  where strength is needed to put in frankly nineteenth-century work,  which could never by any possibility be mistaken for part of the  original building.    One of the most glaring instances of injudicious restoration is to be  met with in the apsidal chapel attached to the eastern side of the south  transept. This work was carried out by the Hon. C.

Is't, or can it be, king Nala--conqueror of his foemen's realms?      Is the lord of men before us?\"--thus within himself he thought.      \"If the skill possessed by Nala--Vahuca possesseth too,      Lo, of Vahuca the knowledge--and of Nala equal seems;      And of Vahuca and Nala--thus alike the age should be.      If 'tis not the noble Nala--it is one of equal skill.      Mighty ones, disguised, are wandering--in the precincts of this earth.      They, divine by inborn nature--but in earthly forms concealed.      His deformity of body--that my judgment still confounds;      Yet that proof alone is wanting--what shall then my judgment be?      In their age they still are equal--though unlike that form misshaped,      Nala gifted with all virtues--Vahuca I needs must deem.\"      Thus the charioteer Varshneya--sate debating in his mind;      Much, and much again he pondered--in the silence of his thought.      But the royal Rituparna--Vahuca's surpassing skill,      With the charioteer Varshneya--sate admiring, and rejoiced.      In the guiding of the coursers--his attentive hand he watched,      Wondered at his skill, consummate--in consummate joy himself.          BOOK XX.          Over rivers, over mountains--through the forests, over lakes,      Fleetly passed they, rapid gliding--like a bird along the air.      As the chariot swiftly travelled--lo, Bhangasuri the king      Saw his upper garment fallen--from the lofty chariot seat;      Though in urgent haste, no sooner--he his fallen mantle saw,      Than the king exclaimed to Nala--\"Pause, and let us take it up:      Check, an instant, mighty-minded!--check thy fiery-footed steeds,      While Varshneya, swift dismounting--bears me back my fallen robe.\"      Nala answered, \"Far behind us--doth thy fallen garment lie;      Ten miles,[122] lo, it lies behind us--turn we not, to gain it, back.\"      Answered thus by noble Nala--then Bhangasuri the king,      Bowed with fruit, within the forest--saw a tall Vibhitak[123] tree:      Gazing on that tree, the raja--spake to Vahuca in haste,      \"Now, O charioteer, in numbers, thou shalt see my passing skill.      Each one knows not every science--none there is that all things knows:      Perfect skill in every knowledge--in one mind there may not be.      On yon tree are leaves how many?--Vahuca, how many fruit?      Say, how many are there fallen?--one above a hundred, there.      One leaf is there 'bove a hundred--and one fruit, O Vahuca!      And of leaves are five ten millions[124]--hanging on those branches two.      Those two branches if thou gather--and the twigs that on them grow,      On those two are fruits two thousand--and a hundred, less by five.\"      Then, when he had check'd the chariot--answered Vahuca the king,      \"What thou speakest, to mine eyesight--all invisible appears;      Visible I'll make it, counting--on yon boughs the leaves and fruit:      Then, when we have strictly numbered--I mistrust mine eyes no more.      In thy presence, king, I'll number--yonder tall Vibhitak-tree.      Whether it may be, or may not--this not done, I cannot know.      I will number, thou beholding--all its fruits, O king of men,      But an instant let Varshneya--hold the bridles of the steeds.\"      To the charioteer the raja--answered, \"Time is none to stay.\"      Vahuca replied, all eager--his own purpose to fulfil,      \"Either stay thou here an instant--or go onward in thy speed,      With the charioteer Varshneya--go, for straight the road before.\"      Answered him king Rituparna--with a bland and soothing voice:      \"Charioteer! on earth thine equal--Vahuca, there may not be;      By thy guidance, skilled in horses!--to Vidarbha I would go:      I in thee have placed reliance--interrupt not then our course:      Willingly will I obey thee--Vahuca, in what thou ask'st,      If this day we reach Vidarbha--ere the sun hath sunk in night.\"      Vahuca replied, \"No sooner--have I numbered yonder fruit,      To Vidarbha will I hasten--grant me then my prayer, O king.\"      Then the raja, all reluctant--\"Stay then, and begin to count;      Of one branch one part, O blameless--from the tall Vibhitak tree,      Man of truth, begin to number--and make glad thine inmost heart.\"      From the chariot quick alighting--Nala tore the branch away.      Then, his soul possess'd with wonder--to the raja thus he said;      \"Having counted, an thou sawest--even so many fruits there are,      Marvellous thy power, O monarch--by mine eyes beheld and proved,      Of that wonder-working science--fain the secret would I hear.\"      Then the raja spake in answer--eager to pursue his way,      \"I of dice possess the science--and in numbers thus am skilled.\"      Vahuca replied; \"That science--if to me thou wilt impart,      In return, O king, receive thou--my surpassing skill in steeds.\"      Then the raja Rituparna--by his pressing need induced,      Eager for that skill in horses--\"Be it so,\" thus 'gan to say;      \"Well, O Vahuca, thou speakest--thou my skill in dice receive,      And of steeds thy wondrous knowledge--be to me a meet return.\"      Rituparna, all his science--saying this, to Nala gave.      Soon as he in dice grew skilful--Kali from his body passed:      He Karkotaka's foul poison--vomiting from out his mouth,      Went from forth his body Kali[125]--tortured by that fiery curse.      Nala, wasted by that conflict--came not instant to himself,      But, released from that dread venom--Kali his own form resumed:      And Nishadha's monarch, Nala--fain would curse him in his ire.      Him addressed the fearful Kali--trembling, and with folded hands;      \"Lord of men, restrain thine anger--I will give thee matchless fame;      Indrasena's wrathful mother--laid on me her fatal curse,[126]      When by thee she was deserted--since that time, O king of men,      I have dwelt in thee in anguish--in the ecstacy of pain.      By the King of Serpents' poison--I have burned by night, by day;      To thy mercy now for refuge--flee I, hear my speech, O king:      Wheresoe'er men, unforgetful--through the world shall laud thy name,      Shall the awful dread of Kali[126]--never in their soul abide.      If thou wilt not curse me, trembling--and to thee for refuge fled.\"      Thus addressed, the royal Nala--all his rising wrath suppressed,      And the fearful Kali entered--in the cloven Vibhitak tree:[127]      To no eyes but those of Nala--visible, had Kali spoken.      Then the monarch of Nishadha--from his inward fever freed,      When away had vanished Kali--when the fruits he had numbered all,      Triumphing in joy unwonted--blazing in his splendour forth,      Proudly mounting on the chariot--onward urged the rapid steeds.      But that tree by Kali entered--since that time stands aye accursed.      Those fleet horses, forward flying--like to birds, again, again,      All his soul elate with transport--Nala swifter, swifter drove;      With his face towards Vidarbha--rode the raja in his pride:      And when forward Nala journeyed--Kali to his home returned.      So released from all his sufferings--Nala went, the king of men,      Dispossessed by Kali, wanting--only now his proper form.          BOOK XXI.          With the evening in Vidarbha--men at watch, as they drew near,      Mighty Rituparna's coming--to king Bhima did proclaim.      Then that king, by Bhima's mandate--entered in Kundina's walls,      All the region round him echoing[128]--with the thunders of his car.      But the echoing of that chariot--when king Nala's horses heard,      In their joy they pawed and trampled[129]--even as Nala's self were there.      Damayanti, too, the rushing--of king Nala's chariot heard.      As a cloud that hoarsely thunders--at the coming of the rains.      All her heart was thrilled with wonder--at that old familiar sound.      On they seemed to come, as Nala--drove of yore his trampling steeds:      Like it seemed to Bhima's daughter--and e'en so to Nala's steeds.      On the palace roofs the peacocks--th' elephants within their stalls,      And the horses heard the rolling--of the mighty monarch's car.      Elephants and peacocks hearing--the fleet chariot rattling on,      Up they raised their necks and clamoured--as at sound of coming rain.[130]        DAMAYANTI _spake_.        \"How the rolling of yon chariot--filling, as it seems, th' earth,      Thrills my soul with unknown transport--it is Nala, king of men.      If this day I see not Nala--with his glowing moonlike face,      Him, the king with countless virtues--I shall perish without doubt.      If this day within th' embraces--of that hero's clasping arms,      I the gentle pressure feel not--without doubt I shall not live.      If 'tis not, like cloud of thunder--he that comes, Nishadha's king,      I this day the fire will enter--burning like the hue of gold.      In his might like the strong lion--like the raging elephant,      Comes he not, the prince of princes--I shall perish without doubt.      Not a falsehood I remember--I remember no offence;      Not an idle word remember--in his noble converse free.      Lofty, patient, like a hero--liberal beyond all kings,      Nought ignoble, as the eunuch--even in private, may he do.      As I think upon his virtues--as I think by day, by night,      All my heart is rent with anguish--widowed of in own beloved.\"        Thus lamenting, she ascended--as with frenzied mind possessed,      To the palace roof's high terrace--to behold the king of men.      In the middle court high seated--in the car, the lord of earth,      Rituparna with Varshneya--and with Vahuca she saw,      When Varshneya from that chariot--and when Vahuca came down,      He let loose those noble coursers--and he stopped the glowing car.      From that chariot-seat descended--Rituparna, king of men,      To the noble monarch Bhima--he drew near, for strength renowned.      Him received with"]]]
