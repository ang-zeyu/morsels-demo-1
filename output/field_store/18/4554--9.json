[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19998"],[0,"Rural Architecture (#12)"],[1,"in this style are not unfrequently seen in the New England  States, and in New York; and the plan is in fact suggested, although not  copied, from some farm houses which we have known there, with  improvements and additions of our own.      [Illustration: FARM HOUSE. Pages 73-74.]    This house may be built either of stone, brick, or wood. The style is  rather rustic than otherwise, and intended to be altogether plain, yet  agreeable in outward appearance, and of quite convenient arrangement.  The body of this house is 40x30 feet on the ground, and 12 feet high,  to the plates for the roof; the lower rooms nine feet high; the roof  intended for a pitch of 35deg--but, by an error in the drawing, made  less--thus affording very tolerable chamber room in the roof story. The  L, or rear projection, containing the wash-room and wood-house, juts out  two feet from the side of the house to which it is attached, with posts  7-1/2 feet high above the floor of the main house; the pitch of the roof  being the same. Beyond this is a building 32x24 feet, with 10 feet  posts, partitioned off into a swill-room, piggery, workshop, and  wagon-house, and a like roof with the others. A light, rustic porch,  12x8 feet, with lattice work, is placed on the front of the house, and  another at the side door, over which vines, by way of drapery, may run;  thus combining that sheltered, comfortable, and home-like expression so  desirable in a rural dwelling. The chimney is carried out in three  separate flues, sufficiently marked by the partitions above the roof.  The windows are hooded, or sheltered, to protect them from the weather,  and fitted with simple sliding sashes with 7x9 or 8x10 glass. Outer  blinds may be added, if required; but it is usually better to have these  _inside_, as they are no ornament to the outside of the building, are  liable to be driven back and forth by the wind, even if fastenings are  used, and in any event are little better than a continual annoyance.        [Illustration: GROUND PLAN.]    INTERIOR ARRANGEMENT.    The front door, over which is a single sash-light across, opens into a  hall or entry 9x7 feet, from which a door opens on either side into a  sitting-room and parlor, each 16x15 feet, lighted by a double, plain  window, at the ends, and a single two-sash window in front. Between the  entrance door and stove, are in each room a small pantry or closet for  dishes, or otherwise, as may be required. The chimney stands in the  center of the house, with a separate flue for each front room, into  which a thimble is inserted to receive the stovepipes by which they are  warmed; and from the inner side of these rooms each has a door passing  to the kitchen, or chief living room. This last apartment is 22x15 feet,  with a broad fireplace containing a crane, hooks, and trammel, if  required, and a spacious family oven--affording those homely and  primitive comforts still so dear to many of us who are not ready to  concede that all the virtues of the present day are combined in a  \"perfection\" cooking stove, and a \"patent\" heater; although there is a  chance for these last, if they should be adopted into the peaceful  atmosphere of this kitchen.      [Illustration: CHAMBER PLAN.]    On one side of the kitchen, in rear of the stairs, is a bedroom, 9x8  feet, with a window in one corner. Adjoining that, is a buttery,  dairy-room, or closet, 9x6 feet, also having a window. At the inner end  of the stairway is the cellar passage; at the outer end is the chamber  passage, landing above, in the highest part of the roof story. Opposite  the chamber stairs is a door leading to the wash-room. Between the two  windows, on the rear side of the kitchen, is a sink, with a waste pipe  passing out through the wall. At the further corner a door opens into a  snug bedroom 9x8 feet, lighted by a window in rear; and adjoining this  is a side entry leading from the end door, 9x6 feet in area; thus making  every room in the house accessible at once from the kitchen, and giving  the greatest possible convenience in both living and house-work.    The roof story is partitioned into convenient-sized bedrooms; the  ceiling running down the pitch of the roof to within two feet of the  floor, unless they are cut short by inner partitions, as they are in the  largest chamber, to give closets. The open area in the center, at the  head of the stairs, is lighted by a small gable window inserted in the  roof, at the rear, and serves as a lumber room; or, if necessary, a bed  may occupy a part of it.    In rear of the main dwelling is a building 44x16 feet, occupied as a  wash-room and wood-house. The wash-room floor is let down eight inches  below the kitchen, and is 16x14 feet, in area, lighted by a window on  each side, with a chimney, in which is set a boiler, and fireplace, if  desired, and a sink in the corner adjoining. This room is 7-1/2 feet in  height. A door passes from this wash-room into the wood-house, which is  30x16 feet, open in front, with a water-closet in the further corner.    The cellar is 7-1/2 feet in height--and is the whole size of the house,  laid with good stone wall, in lime mortar, with a flight of steps  leading outside, in rear of the kitchen, and two or more sash-light  windows at the ends. If not in a loose, gravelly, or sandy soil, the  cellar should be kept dry by a drain leading out on to lower ground.    The building beyond, and adjoining the wood-house, contains a  swill-house 16x12 feet, with a window in one end; a chimney and boiler  in one corner, with storage for swill barrels, grain, meal, potatoes,  &c., for feeding the pigs, which are in the adjoining pen of same size,  with feeding trough, place for sleeping, &c., and having a window in one  end and a door in the rear, leading to a yard.    Adjoining these, in front, is a workshop and tool-house, 16x10 feet,  with a window at the end, and an entrance door near the wood house. In  this is a joiner's work-bench, a chest of working tools, such as saw,  hammer, augers, &c., &c., necessary for repairing implements, doing  little rough jobs, or other wood work, &c., which every farmer ought to  do for himself; and also storing his hoes, axes, shovels, hammers, and  other small farm implements. In this room he will find abundant  rainy-day employment in repairing his utensils of various kinds, making  his beehives, hencoops, &c., &c. Next to this is the wagon-house, 16x14  feet, with broad doors at the end, and harness pegs around the walls.    The posts of this building are 10 feet high; the rooms eight feet high,  and a low chamber overhead for storing lumber, grain, and other  articles, as may be required. Altogether, these several apartments make  a very complete and desirable accommodation to a man with the property  and occupation for which it is intended.    On one side and adjoining the house, should be the garden, the  clothes-yard, and the bee-house, which last should always stand in full  sight, and facing the most frequented room--say the kitchen--that they  can be seen daily during the swarming season, as those performing  household duties may keep them in view.      MISCELLANEOUS.    In regard to the surroundings, and approach to this dwelling, they  should be treated under the suggestions already given on these subjects.  This is an exceedingly _snug_ tenement, and everything around and about  it should be of the same character. No pretension or frippery whatever.  A neat garden, usefully, rather than ornamentally and profusely  supplied; a moderate court-yard in front; free access to the end door,  from the main every-day approach by vehicles--not on the highway, but on  the farm road or lane--the business entrance, in fact; which should also  lead to the barns and sheds beyond, not far distant. Every feature  should wear a most domestic look, and breathe an air of repose and  content. Trees should be near, but not so near as to cover the house.  A few shrubs of simple kind--some standing roses--a few climbing ones;  a syringa, a lilac, a snow ball, and a little patch or two of flowers  near the front porch, and the whole expression is given; just as one  would wish to look upon as a simple, unpretending habitation.    It is not here proposed to give working plans, or estimates, to a  nicety; or particular directions for building any design even, that we  present. The material for construction best suited to the circumstances  and locality of the proprietor must govern all those matters; and as  good builders are in most cases at hand, who are competent to give  estimates for the cost of any given plan, when the material for  construction is once settled, the question of expense is readily fixed.  The same sized house, with the same accommodation, may be made to cost  fifty to one hundred per cent. over an economical estimate, by the  increased style, or manner of its finish; or it may be kept within  bounds by a rigid adherence to the plan first adopted.    In western New York this house and attachments complete, the body of  stone, the wood-house, wagon-house, &c., of wood, may be built and well  finished in a plain way for $1,500. If built altogether of wood, with  grooved and matched vertical boarding, and battens, the whole may be  finished and painted for $800, to $1,200. For the lowest sum, the lumber  and work would be of a rough kind, with a cheap wash to color it; but  the latter amount would give good work, and a lasting coat of mineral  paint both outside and within.    As a _tenant_ house on a farm of three, four, or even five hundred  acres, where all who live in it are laborers in the field or household,  this design may be most conveniently adopted. The family inhabiting it  in winter may be well accommodated for sleeping under the main roof,  while they can at all seasons take their meals, and be made comfortable  in the several rooms. In the summer season, when a larger number of  laborers are employed, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#12)"],[1," with extreme  care.  The southern side is occupied by the ``refectory''  (K), from the west end of which by a vestibule the kitchen  (L) is reached.  This is separated from the main buildings  of the monastery, and is connected by a long passage with  a building containing the bake house and brewhouse (M), and  the sleeping-rooms of the servants.  The upper story of the  refectory is the ``vestiarium,'' where the ordinary clothes of  the brethren were kept.  On the western side of the cloister  is another two story building (N). The cellar is below,  and the larder and store-room above.  Between this building  and the church, opening by one door into the cloisters, and  by another to the outer part of the monastery area, is the  ``parlour'' for interviews with visitors from the external  world (O). On the eastern side of the north transept is the  ``scriptorium'' or writing-room (P1), with the library above.    To the east of the church stands a group of buildings comprising  two miniature conventual establishments, each complete in  itself.  Each has a covered cloister surrounded by the usual  buildings, i.e. refectory, dormitory, &c., and a church or  chapel on one side, placed back to back.  A detached building  belonging to each contains a bath and a kitchen.  One of these  diminutive convents is appropriated to the ``oblati'' or novices  (Q), the other to the sick monks as an ``imfirmary'' (R).    The ``residence of the physicians'' (S) stands contiguous to the  infirmary, and the physic garden (T) at the north-east corner of  the monastery.  Besides other rooms, it contains a drug store,  and a chamber for those who are dangerously ill.  The ``house  for bloodletting and purging'' adjoins it on the west (U).    The ``outer school,'' to the north of the convent area, contains  a large schoolroom divided across the middle by a screen or  partition, and surrounded by fourteen little rooms, termed  the dwellings of the scholars.  The head-master's house (W)  is opposite, built against the side wall of the church.  The  two ``hospitia'' or `' guest-houses'' for the entertainment  of strangers of different degrees (X1 X2) comprise a large  common chamber or refectory in the centre, surrounded by  sleeping-apartments.  Each is provided with its own brewhouse  and bakehouse, and that for travellers of a superior order has  a kitchen and storeroom, with bedrooms for their servants and  stables for their horses.  There is also an ``hospitium'' for  strange monks, abutting on the north wall of the church (Y).    Beyond the cloister, at the extreme verge of the convent  area to the south, stands the `factory'' (Z), containing  workshops for shoemakers, saddlers (or shoemakers, sellarii),  cutlers and grinders, trencher-makers, tanners, curriers,  fullers, smiths and goldsmiths, with their dwellings in the  rear.  On this side we also find the farmbuildings, the large  granary and threshing-floor (a), mills (c), malthouse  (d). Facing the west are the stables (e), ox-sheds  (f), goatstables (gl, piggeries (h), sheep-folds (i),  together with the servants' and labourers' quarters (k).  At the south-east corner we find the hen and duck house, and  poultry-yard (m), and the dwelling of the keeper (n).  Hard by is the kitchen garden (o), the beds bearing the  names of the vegetables growing in them, onions, garlic,  celery, lettuces, poppy, carrots, cabbages, &c., eighteen in  all.  In the same way the physic garden presents the names  of the medicinal herbs, and the cemetery (p) those of  the trees, apple, pear, plum, quince, &c., planted there.    Canterbury Cathedral.    A curious bird's-eye view of Canterbury Cathedral and its  annexed conventual buildings, taken about 1165, is preserved  in the Great Psalter in the library of Trinity College,  Cambridge.  As elucidated by Professor Willis,1 it exhibits  the plan of a great Benedictine monastery in the 12th century,  and enables us to compare it with that of the 9th as seen at St  Gall.  We see in both the same general principles of arrangement,  which indeed belong to all Benedictine monasteries, enabling  us to determine with precision the disposition of the various  buildings, when little more than fragments of the walls  exist.  From some local reasons, however, the cloister and  monastic buildings are placed on the north, instead, as is far  more commonly the case, on the south of the church.  There is  also a separate chapter-house, which is wanting at St Gall.    The buildings at Canterbury, as at St Gall, form separate  groups.  The church forms the nucleus.  In immediate contact  with this, on the north side, lie the cloister and the  group of buildings devoted to the monastic life.  Outside of  these, to the west and east, are the ``halls and chambers  devoted to the exercise of hospitality, with which every  monastery was provided, for the purpose of receiving as  guests persons who visited it, whether clergy or laity,  travellers, pilgrims or paupers.'' To the north a large  open court divides the monastic from the menial buildings,  intentionally placed as remote as possible from the conventual  buildings proper, the stables, granaries, barn, bakehouse,  brewhouse, laundries, &c., inhabited by the lay servants of the  establishment.  At the greatest possible distance from the  church, beyond the precinct of the convent, is the eleemosynary  department.  The almonry for the relief of the poor,  with a great hall annexed, forms the paupers' hospitium.    The most important group of buildings is naturally that devoted  to monastic life.  This includes two Cloisters, the great  cloister surrounded by the buildings essentially connected with  the daily life of the monks,---the church to the south, the  refectory or frater-house here as always on the side opposite  to the church, and farthest removed from it, that no sound or  smell of eating might penetrate its sacred precincts, to the  east the dormitory, raised on a vaulted undercroft, and the  chapter-house adjacent, and the lodgings of the cellarer to the  west.  To this officer was committed the provision of the  monks' daily food, as well as that of the guests.  He was,  therefore, appropriately lodged in the immediate vicinity of  the refectory and kitchen, and close to the guest-hall.  A  passage under the dormitory leads eastwards to the smaller  or infirmary cloister, appropriated to the sick and infirm  monks.  Eastward of this cloister extend the hall and chapel of  the infirmary, resembling in form and arrangement the nave and  chancel of an aisled church.  Beneath the dormitory, looking  out into the green court or herbarium, lies the ``pisalis''  or ``calefactory,'' the common room of the monks.  At its  north-east corner access was given from the dormitory to the  necessarium, a portentous edifice in the form of a Norman  hall, 145 ft. long by 25 broad, containing fifty-five seats.  It  was, in common with all such offices in ancient monasteries,  constructed with the most careful regard to cleanliness and  health, a stream of water running through it from end to  end.  A second smaller dormitory runs from east to west for  the accommodation of the conventual officers, who were bound  to sleep in the dormitory.  Close to the refectory, but outside  the cloisters, are the domestic offices connected with it:  to the north, the kitchen, 47 ft. square, surmounted by a  lofty pyramidal roof, and the kitchen court; to the west, the  butteries, pantries, &c. The infirmary had a small kitchen of its  own.  Opposite the refectory door in the cloister are two  lavatories, an invariable adjunct to a monastic dining-hall,  at which the monks washed before and after taking food.    The buildings devoted to hospitality were divided into three  groups.  The prior's group ``entered at the south-east angle  of the green court, placed near the most sacred part of the  cathedral, as befitting the distinguished ecclesiastics or  nobility who were assigned to him.'' The cellarer's buildings  were near the west end of the nave, in which ordinary visitors  of the middle class were hospitably entertained.  The inferior  pilgrims and paupers were relegated to the north hall or almonry,  just within the gate, as far as possible from the other two.    Westminster Abbey.    Westminster Abbey is another example of a great Benedictine  abbey, identical in its general arrangements, so far as they  can be traced, with those described above.  The cloister and  , monastic buildings lie to the south side of the church.  Parallel to the nave, on the south side of the cloister,  was the refectory, with its lavatory at the door.  On the  eastern side we find the remains of the dormitory, raised  on a vaulted substructure and communicating with the south  transept.  The chapter-house opens out of the same alley of the  cloister.  The small cloister lles to the south-east of  the larger cloister, and still farther to the east we have  the remains of the infirmary with the table hall, the  refectory of those who were able to leave their chambers.  The  abbot's house formed a small courtyard at the west entrance,  close to the inner gateway.  Considerable portions of this  remain, including the abbot's parlour. celebrated as ``the  Jerusalem Chamber,'' his hall, now used for the Westminster  King's Scholars, and the kitchen and butteries beyond.    York.    St Mary's Abbey, York, of which the ground-plan is annexed,  exhibits the usual Benedictine arrangements.  The precincts  are surrounded by a strong fortified wall on three sides,  the river Ouse being sufficient protection on the fourth  side.  The entrance was by a strong gateway (U) to the  north.  Close to the entrance was a chapel, where is now  the church of St Olaf (W), in which the new-comers paid  their devotions immediately on their arrival.  Near the  gate to the south was the guest-hall or hospitium (T).  The buildings are completely ruined, but enough remains to"]]]
