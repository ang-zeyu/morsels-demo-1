But as the notes in sweetest cadence rang,      I thought it was my hidden love who sang.                    4        The melody of song, the stricken strings      In undertone that half-unconscious clings,      More clearly sounding when the passions rise,      But ever sweeter as the music dies.      Words that strong passion fain would say again,      Yet checks their second utterance--in vain;      For music sweet as this lives on, until      I walk as hearing sweetest music still.                      5    _Maitreya._ But see, my friend! The very dogs are sound asleep in  the shops that look out on the market. Let us go home. [_He looks  before him._] Look, look! The blessed moon seems to give place to  darkness, as she descends from her palace in heaven.    _Charudatta._ True.        The moon gives place to darkness as she dips      Behind the western mountain; and the tips      Of her uplifted horns alone appear,      Like two sharp-pointed tusks uplifted clear,      Where bathes an elephant in waters cool,      Who shows naught else above the jungle pool.                 6    P. 89.1]    _Maitreya._ Well, here is our house. Vardhamanaka, Vardhamanaka,  open the door!    _Vardhamanaka._ I hear Maitreya's voice. Charudatta has returned.  I must open the door for him. [_He does so._] Master, I salute you.  Maitreya, I salute you too. The couch is ready. Pray be seated.  [_Charudatta and Maitreya enter and seat themselves._]    _Maitreya._ Vardhamanaka, call Radanika to wash our feet.    _Charudatta._ [_Compassionately._] She sleeps. Do not wake her.    _Vardhamanaka._ I will bring the water, Maitreya, and you may  wash Charudatta's feet.    _Maitreya._ [_Angrily._] Look, man. He acts like the son of a slave  that he is, for he is bringing water. But he makes me wash your  feet, and I am a Brahman.    _Charudatta._ Good Maitreya, do you bring the water, and Vardhamanaka  shall wash my feet.    _Vardhamanaka._ Yes, Maitreya. Do you bring the water. [_Maitreya  does so. Vardhamanaka washes Charudatta's feet, then moves away._]    _Charudatta._ Let water be brought for the Brahman's feet.    _Maitreya._ What good does water do my feet? I shall have to roll  in the dirt again, like a beaten ass.    _Vardhamanaka._ Maitreya, you are a Brahman.    _Maitreya._ Yes, like a slow-worm among all the other snakes, so  am I a Brahman among all the other Brahmans.    _Vardhamanaka._ Maitreya, I will wash your feet after all. [_He does  so._] Maitreya, this golden casket I was to keep by day, you by  night. Take it.                [_He gives it to Maitreya, then exit._    _Maitreya._ [_Receiving the casket._] The thing is here still. Isn't there  a single thief in Ujjayini to steal the wretch that robs me of my  sleep? Listen. I am going to take it into the inner court.    [46.1. S.    _Charud._        Such lax attention we can ill afford.        If we are trusted by a courtezan,        Then, Brahman, prove yourself an honest man,      And guard it safely, till it be restored.                    7    [_He nods, repeating the stanza_ \"The melody of song, the stricken  strings:\" _page_ 44.]    _Maitreya._ Are you going to sleep?    _Charudatta._ Yes, so it seems.        For conquering sleep, descending on mine eyes,        First smites the brow with unresisted blow;      Unseen, elusive, like old age, she tries        To gather strength by weakening her foe.                   8    _Maitreya._ Then let's go to sleep. [_He does so._]           *       *       *       *       *    [_Enter Sharvilaka._[45]]    _Sharv._        I made an entrance for my body's round        By force of art and arms, a path to deeds!      I skinned my sides by crawling on the ground,      Like a snake that sloughs the skin no longer sound:        And now I go where my profession leads.                    9    [_He gazes at the sky. Joyfully._] See! The blessed moon is setting.  For well I know,        My trade would fain from watchmen's eyes be shrouded;        Valiant, I force the dwelling of another.      But see, the stars in deepest dark are clouded,        And the night shields me like a careful mother.            10    I made a breach in the orchard wall and entered. And now I must force my  way into the inner court as well.        Yes, let men call it vulgar, if they will,        The trade that thrives while sleeps the sleepyhead;      Yes, knavery, not bravery, call it still,        To overreach confiding folk a-bed.    P. 86.9]        Far better blame and hissing, fairly won.        Than the pay of genuflecting underlings;      This antique path was trod by Drona's son,        Who slew the sleeping, unsuspecting kings.                 11    But where shall I make the breach?        Where is the spot which falling drops decayed?        For each betraying sound is deadened there.      No yawning breach should in the walls be made,        So treatises on robbery declare.      Where does the palace crumble? Where the place        That niter-eaten bricks false soundness wear?      Where shall I 'scape the sight of woman's face?        Fulfilment of my wishes waits me there.                    12    [_He feels the wall._] Here is a spot weakened by constant sun and  sprinkling and eaten by saltpeter rot. And here is a pile of dirt  thrown up by a mouse. Now heaven be praised! My venture prospers.  This is the first sign of success for Skanda's[46] sons. Now first  of all, how shall I make the breach? The blessed Bearer of the  Golden Lance[47] has prescribed four varieties of breach, thus: if  the bricks are baked, pull them out; if they are unbaked, cut  them; if they are made of earth, wet them; if they are made of  wood, split them. Here we have baked bricks; ergo, pull out the  bricks.        Now what shall be the shape I give the breach?        A \"lotus,\" \"cistern,\" \"crescent moon,\" or \"sun\"?      \"Oblong,\" or \"cross,\" or \"bulging pot\"? for each        The treatises permit. Which one? which one?      And where shall I display my sovereign skill,      That in the morning men may wonder still?                    13    In this wall of baked bricks, the \"bulging pot\" would be effective. I  will make that.    [47.16. S.        At other walls that I have pierced by night,        And at my less successful ventures too,      The crowd of neighbors gazed by morning light,        Assigning praise or blame, as was my due.                  14    Praise to the boon-conferring god, to Skanda of immortal youth!  Praise to him, the Bearer of the Golden Lance, the Brahman's  god, the pious! Praise to him, the Child of the Sun! Praise to him,  the teacher of magic, whose first pupil I am! For he found pleasure  in me and gave me magic ointment,        With which so I anointed be,      No watchman's eye my form shall see;      And edged sword that falls on me      From cruel wounds shall leave me free.                       15    [_He anoints himself._] Alas, I have forgotten my measuring line.  [_Reflecting._] Aha! This sacred cord[48] shall be my measuring line.  Yes, the sacred cord is a great blessing to a Brahman, especially to one  like me. For, you see,        With this he measures, ere he pierce a wall,        And picks the lock, when jewels are at stake.      It serves as key to bolted door and hall,        As tourniquet for bite of worm and snake.                  16    The measuring is done. I begin my task. [_He does so, then takes a  look._] My breach lacks but a single brick. Alas, I am bitten by a  snake. [_He binds his finger with the sacred cord, and manifests the  workings of poison._] I have applied the remedy, and now I am restored.  [_He continues his work, then gazes._] Ah, there burns a candle.  See!        Though jealous darkness hems it round,        The golden-yellow candle from its place      Shines through the breach upon the ground,        Like a streak of gold upon the touchstone's face.          17    P. 87.9]    [_He returns to his work._] The breach is finished. Good! I enter.  But no, I will not enter yet. I will shove a dummy in. [_He does  so._] Ah, no one is there. Praise be to Skanda! [_He enters and looks  about._] See! Two men asleep. Come, for my own protection I will  open the door. But the house is old and the door squeaks. I must  look for water. Now where might water be? [_He looks about, finds  water, and sprinkles the door. Anxiously._] I hope it will not fall  upon the floor and make a noise. Come, this is the way. [_He puts  his back against the door and opens it cautiously._] Good! So much  for that. Now I must discover whether these two are feigning  sleep, or whether they are asleep in the fullest meaning of the  term. [_He tries to terrify them, and notes the effect._] Yes, they must  be asleep in the fullest meaning of the term. For see!        Their breath first calmly rises, ere it sink;        Its regularity all fear defies.        Unmoving in their socket-holes, the eyes      Are tightly closed, and never seem to wink.      The limbs relaxed, at ease the bodies lie,        I see their feet beyond the bedstead peep,      The lighted candle vexes not the eye;        It would, if they were only feigning sleep.                18    [_He looks about him._] What! a drum? And here is a flute. And  here, a snare-drum. And here, a lute. And reed-pipes. And yonder,  manuscripts. Is this the house of a dancing-master? But no!  When I entered, I was convinced that this was a palatial residence.  Now then, is this man poor in the fullest meaning of the term, or,  from fear of the king or of thieves, does he keep his property  buried? Well, my own property is buried, too. But I will scatter  the seeds that betray subterranean gold. [_He does so._] The scattered  seeds nowhere swell up. Ah, he is poor in the fullest meaning  of the term. Good! I go.    _Maitreya._ [_Talking in his sleep._] "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21035"],[0,"The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch (#12)"],[1,"with  vexation.  However it couldn't be helped, and he had learned before now  how to take a disappointment like a man.  So when Tom appealed to him he  put a good face on it, and said,--    \"Awful hard lines.  Never mind, let's go back and see the match with the  Badgers, Tom.\"    \"Why don't you come with us?\" asked Gus.  \"We are going to Gurley; have  you ever been to Gurley, young un?\"    \"No,\" said Charlie.    \"Come along, then, we'll show it you.  It's a prime town, isn't it,  Margetson?\"    \"Don't ask me,\" said Margetson; \"I'd sooner see about Gurley than catch  a seven-pounder, any day.\"    \"And besides,\" said Tom, \"isn't there some good fishing above the lock!  Come along, Charlie; we shall not be baulked of our day's sport after  all.\"    Charlie joined the party, although he did not conceive any great  admiration for Tom's three friends.  His anxiety not to offend his now  reconciled enemy, and the possibility of fishing after all, overruled  him; and still dragging the bag, he trudged along with the others  towards Gurley.    As they approached the town he could not help noticing the number of  holiday-makers and vehicles that passed them.  There were drags full of  gaily-dressed ladies; and gentlemen who wore veils; and there were light  jaunty dog-carts with spruce young white-hatted gentlemen perched in  them; there were vans in which corks were popping like musketry fires  and parties on foot like themselves, hurrying forward with loud laughter  and coarse music.    \"Surely,\" thought he, \"there's something on at Gurley.\"    Presently a waggonette, driven by a very loud youth in a check suit, and  with an enormous cigar in his mouth, pulled up in passing, and its  driver addressed Gus.    \"So you've found _your_ way here, have you, my young bantam?  Catch  _you_ being out of a good thing.  Are you going on the grand stand?\"    \"Don't know,\" said Gus grandly.  \"We may pick up a trap in the town.\"    \"Ho, ho! going to do it flash, are you?  Well, there's one of you could  do with a little spice,\" added he, glancing at Charlie.  \"I suppose my  trap's not grand enough for you.\"    \"Can you give us a lift, then, Bill?\" asked Gus, charmed at the idea.    \"Yes, to be sure; I've no company to-day.  There's just room.  Hop in.  I may as well turn an honest penny as not.  Here, you young sinner, jump  up beside me on the box.\"  And before Charlie knew where he was or  whither he was going he found himself on the box of the waggonette  beside the flash youth, and his four friends behind him inside.    \"Who's your friend, Gus?\" he heard Margetson ask.    \"Son of Belsham, who keeps the `Green Tiger' at Randlebury.  We're in  luck, I can tell you, you fellows.\"    As Charlie gradually recovered from his bewilderment he felt himself  extremely uncomfortable and ill at ease.  From what had been said he had  gathered that the object of the boys in going to Gurley was something  more than to see the town; and he by no means liked Gus's new friend, or  approved of his easy familiarity with a low publican's son.  It was not  long before his dawning suspicions were fully confirmed.    \"So you're going to see the races?\" asked Mr Belsham.    \"No, I'm not,\" replied Charlie, as curtly as he could, for he had no  desire to encourage the conversation of this objectionable person.    \"Ain't you?  And what are you going to do, then, my young lamb?\"  And in  the course of this brief sentence Mr Belsham succeeded in interjecting  at least three oaths.    \"I shan't speak to you if you swear,\" said Charlie; \"it's wrong to  swear.\"    \"No! is it?  Who says that?\"    \"My father says so,\" blurted out Charlie, fully satisfied that no better  reason could be demanded.    Belsham laughed, and turning to the four inside, said,--    \"I say, young gentlemen, this young pippin tells me he's got a father  who says it's wrong to swear.  What do you think of that?\"    \"His father must be an amusing man,\" replied Gus.    \"Wait till we get on to the course,\" said Margetson; \"he'll hear  something to astonish him there, young prig!\"    \"I'm not going to the races!\" cried my master, starting from his seat,  and now fully alive to the fraud of which he had been made the victim.  \"How could you do this, Tom Drift!  Let me down, will you!\" and he  struggled so desperately with Belsham that that gentleman was obliged to  let go the reins in order to hold him.    Of course it was no use his resisting.  Amid the shouts and jeers of his  schoolfellows he was held on to the box.  In vain he pleaded, besought,  struggled, threatened; there he was compelled to stay, all through  Gurley and out to the racecourse.  Here he found himself in the midst of  a yelling, blaspheming, drunken multitude, from the sight of whose faces  and the sound of whose words his soul revolted so vehemently that it  lent new vigour to his exhausted frame, and urged him to one last  desperate struggle to free himself and escape from his tormentors.    \"Look here,\" said Belsham to Gus; \"if you suppose I'm going to have all  my fun spoiled by looking after this cub of yours while you're enjoying  yourselves there inside, you're mistaken; here, look after him  yourselves.\"    So saying, he dragged Charlie from his seat and swung him down into the  waggonette with such force that he lay there half stunned and incapable  of further resistance, and so for the time being saved his persecutors a  good deal of trouble.    And indeed had it been otherwise it is hardly likely they would have  just then been able to pay him much attention, for at that moment the  horses were all drawn up at the starting-post, waiting for the signal to  go.    That was a feverish moment for Tom Drift.  He had bet all his money on  one horse, and if that horse did not win, he would lose every penny of  it.    As usual, he had repented a hundred times of that day's business, and  the last brutal outrage on poor Charlie had called up even in his seared  breast a fleeting feeling of indescribable shame.  It was, alas! only  fleeting.    Next moment he forgot all but the horses.  There they stood in a long  restless line.  A shout! and they were off.  In the first wild scramble  he could catch a sight of the colours on which his hopes depended near  the front.  On they came like the wind.  A man near shouted the name of  Tom's horse--\"It's winning,\" and Tom's head swam at the sound.  On still  nearer, and now they have passed.  In the retreating, straggling crowd  he can see his horse still, but it seems to be going back instead of  forward.  Like a torrent the others overhaul and pass it.  Then a louder  shout than usual proclaims the race over, and the favourite beaten, and  Tom staggers down to his seat sick and half stupid.    \"Never mind, old man,\" he heard Gus say, \"luck's against you this time;  you'll have your turn some day.  Take some of this, man, and never say  die.\"    And Tom, reckless in his misery, took the proffered bottle, and drank  deeply.    It was late in the afternoon before Belsham thought of turning his  horse's head homeward, and by that time Charlie, on the floor of the  waggonette, was slowly beginning to recover consciousness.        CHAPTER NINE.    HOW MY MASTER AND I HAD QUITE AS MUCH EXCITEMENT IN ONE AFTERNOON AS WAS  GOOD FOR US.    Just as they were turning to go, a sudden shout and rush of people  arrested them.  The crowd on the course had been immense, and of the  roughest and lowest description: sharpers, thieves, and roughs were  there by the hundred, attracted from the neighbouring villages by the  opportunity of plunder and riot which Gurley races always afforded.  As  soon as the serious business of the racing was over, this low mob  naturally sought excitement of their own making, and increasing in  disorder and intemperance as the day wore on, had become beyond control  just about the time when Mr Belsham, junior, took it into his muddled  head to make a start in the direction of home.  The shout which kept him  where he was, was occasioned by that spectacle dear to the eyes of all  blackguards, a fight.  Round the two blood and dust-stained combatants,  the mob surged and yelled.  Every moment it grew denser and wilder; and  every moment it swayed nearer and nearer to the spot where the  Randlebury boys stood in their waggonette; and before they could move or  get clear, they found themselves in the very centre of the mob.  Shouts,  shrieks, and wild laughter rose on every side of them; some of the crowd  scrambled up onto their wheels to get a glimpse of the pugilists; some  abused and swore at them for getting in the way; some tried to invade  their waggonette, and struck at them when they resisted.    In the midst of all, Belsham's horse took fright.  There was a wild  plunge, a shriek from the crowd in front, and next moment the five boys  were thrown down among the crowd, while the horse, with the shattered  and overturned vehicle behind him, forced for himself a ghastly lane  through the mob.    Of Gus and his three friends, Charlie, whom the shock roused to sudden  consciousness, could see nothing.  He tried to rise, but the crowd  pressed too wildly to give him the chance.  For some moments he lay  among a host of crowding, struggling feet, expecting every moment to be  stunned, if not killed.  But by a wonderful providence he escaped the  peril.  The crowd gave a sudden swing in a new direction, and he was  left unhurt, though stupefied and almost unable to stir.    Presently he was conscious of a man standing in front of him.    \"Oh, help me!\" gasped my poor master.    The man seized him roughly by the arm and raised him to his feet.    \"That's worth a tip,\" he growled; \"come, hand over.\"    Charlie put his hand in his pocket and drew out a shilling.    The man scowled.    \"Do you suppose I'll take a dirty shilling?  Come, young swell, empty  out them pockets.  Look sharp, I've no time to waste on the like of  you.\"    Tremblingly Charlie obeyed, and"]]]
