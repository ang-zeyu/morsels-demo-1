After having summarily announced this thesis in       his _Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens_, p. 12, et seq.,       he has set it forth at length in a special treatise, _Der       Babylonische Ursprung der agyptischen Kultur_, 1892, wherein       he endeavours to prove that the Heliopolitan myths, and       hence the whole Egyptian religion, are derived from the       cults of Eridu, and would make the name of the Egyptian city       Onu, or Anu, identical with that of _Nun-H, Nun_, which is       borne by the Chaldean.    Some think that the people took the shortest road across the Isthmus  of Suez, others give them longer peregrinations and a more complicated  itinerary. They would have them cross the Straits of Bab el-Mandeb,  and then the Abyssinian mountains, and, spreading northward and keeping  along the Nile, finally settle in the Egypt of to-day. A more minute  examination compels us to recognize that the hypothesis of an Asiatic  origin, however attractive it may seem, is somewhat difficult  to maintain. The bulk of the Egyptian population presents the  characteristics of those white races which have been found established  from all antiquity on the Mediterranean slope of the Libyan continent;  this population is of African origin, and came to Egypt from the West  or South-West. In the valley, perhaps, it may have met with a black race  which it drove back or destroyed; and there, perhaps, too, it afterwards  received an accretion of Asiatic elements, introduced by way of the  isthmus and the marshes of the Delta. But whatever may be the origin  of the ancestors of the Egyptians, they were scarcely settled upon the  banks of the Nile before the country conquered, and assimilated them to  itself, as it has never ceased to do in the case of strangers who have  occupied it. At the time when their history begins for us, all the  inhabitants had long formed but one people, with but one language.    This language seems to be connected with the Semitic tongues by many  of its roots. It forms its personal pronouns, whether isolated or  suffixed, in a similar way. One of the tenses of the conjugation, and  that the simplest and most archaic, is formed with identical affixes.  Without insisting upon resemblances which are open to doubt, it may be  almost affirmed that most of the grammatical processes used in Semitic  languages are to be found in a rudimentary condition in Egyptian. One  would say that the language of the people of Egypt and the languages of  the Semitic races, having once belonged to the same group, had separated  very early, at a time when the vocabulary and the grammatical system  of the group had not as yet taken definite shape. Subject to different  influences, the two families would treat in diverse fashion the elements  common to both. The Semitic dialects continued to develop for centuries,  while the Egyptian language, although earlier cultivated, stopped short  in its growth. \"If it is obvious that there was an original connexion  between the language of Egypt and that of Asia, this connexion is  nevertheless sufficiently remote to leave to the Egyptian race a  distinct physiognomy.\" We recognize it in sculptured and painted  portraits, as well as in thousands of mummied bodies out of subterranean  tombs. The highest type of Egyptian was tall and slender, with a proud  and imperious air in the carriage of his head and in his whole bearing.  He had wide and full shoulders, well-marked and vigorous pectoral  muscles, muscular arms, a long, fine hand, slightly developed hips, and  sinewy legs. The detail of the knee-joint and the muscles of the calf  are strongly marked beneath the skin; the long, thin, and low-arched  feet are flattened out at the extremities owing to the custom of going  barefoot. The head is rather short, the face oval, the forehead somewhat  retreating. The eyes are wide and fully opened, the cheekbones not too  marked, the nose fairly prominent, and either straight or aquiline. The  mouth is long, the lips full, and lightly ridged along their outline;  the teeth small, even, well-set, and remarkably sound; the ears are set  high on the head. At birth the skin is white, but darkens in proportion  to its exposure to the sun. Men are generally painted red in the  pictures, though, as a matter of fact, there must already have been  all the shades which we see among the present population^ from a most  delicate, rose-tinted complexion to that of a smoke-coloured bronze.  Women, who were less exposed to the sun, are generally painted yellow,  the tint paler in proportion as they rise in the social scale. The hair  was inclined to be wavy, and even to curl into little ringlets, but  without ever turning into the wool of the negro.    [Illustration: 059.jpg THE NOBLE TYPE OF EGYPTIAN. 1]         1 Statue of Ranofir in the Gizeh Museum (Vth dynasty), after       a photograph by Emil Brugsch-Bey.    [Illustration: 060.jpg HEAD OF A TILEBAN MUMMY.]    The beard was scanty, thick only upon the chin. Such was the highest  type; the commoner was squat, dumpy, and heavy. Chest and shoulders seem  to be enlarged at the expense of the pelvis and the hips, to such an  extent as to make the want of proportion between the upper and lower  parts of the body startling and ungraceful. The skull is long, somewhat  retreating, and slightly flattened on the top; the features are coarse,  and as though carved in flesh by great strokes of the blocking-out  chisel. Small frseuated eyes, a short nose, flanked by widely distended  nostrils, round cheeks, a square chin, thick, but not curling lips--this  unattractive and ludicrous physiognomy, sometimes animated by an  expression of cunning which recalls the shrewd face of an old French  peasant, is often lighted up by gleams of gentleness and of melancholy  good-nature. The external characteristics of these two principal types  in the ancient monuments, in all varieties of modifications, may still  be seen among the living. The profile copied from a Theban mummy taken  at hazard from a necropolis of the XVIIIth dynasty, and compared with  the likeness of a modern Luxor peasant, would almost pass for a family  portrait. Wandering Bisharin have inherited the type of face of a great  noble, the contemporary of Kheops; and any peasant woman of the Delta  may bear upon her shoulders che head of a twelfth-dynasty king. A  citizen of Cairo, gazing with wonder at the statues of Khafra or of Seti  I. in the Gizeh Museum, is himself, feature for feature, the very image  of those ancient Pharaohs, though removed from them by fifty centuries.    [Illustration: 062.jpg A FELLAH WOMAN WITH THE FEATURES OF AN ANCIENT  KING. 1]         1  The face of the woman here given was taken separately,       and was subsequently attached to the figure of an Egyptian       woman whom Naville had photographed sitting beside a       colossal head. The nose of the statue has been restored.    Until quite recently nothing, or all but nothing, had been discovered  which could be attributed to the primitive races of Egypt: even the  flint weapons and implements which had been found in various places  could not be ascribed to them with any degree of certainty, for the  Egyptians continued to use stone long after metal was known to them.  They made stone arrowheads, hammers, and knives, not only in the time of  the Pharaohs, but under the Romans, and during the whole period of  the Middle Ages, and the manufacture of them has not yet entirely died  out.[**]         **  An entire collection of flint tools--axes, adzes,       knives, and sickles--mostly with wooden handles, were found       by Prof. Petrie in the ruins of Kahun, at the entrance to       the Fayum: these go back to the time of the twelfth dynasty,       more than three thousand years before our era. Mariette had       previously pointed out to the learned world the fact that a       Coptic _Reis_, Salib of Abydos, in charge of the       excavations, shaved his head with a flint knife, according       to the custom of his youth (1820-35). I knew the man, who       died at over eighty years of age in 1887; he was still       faithful to his flint implement, while his sons and the       whole population of El Kharbeh were using nothing but steel       razors. As his scalp was scraped nearly raw by the       operation, he used to cover his head with fresh leaves to       cool the inflamed skin.    These objects, and the workshops where they were made, might therefore  be less ancient than the greater part of the inscribed monuments. But if  so far we had found no examples of any work belonging to the first ages,  we met in historic times with certain customs which were out of harmony  with the general civilization of the period. A comparison of these  customs with analogous practices of barbarous nations threw light upon  the former, completed their meaning, and showed us at the same time the  successive stages through which the Egyptian people had to pass before  reaching their highest civilization. We knew, for example, that even  as late as the Caesars, girls belonging to noble families at Thebes were  consecrated to the service of Amon, and were thus licensed to a life  of immorality, which, however, did not prevent them from making rich  marriages when age obliged them to retire from office. Theban women were  not the only people in the world to whom such licence was granted or  imposed upon them by law; wherever in a civilized country we see a  similar practice, we may recognize in it an ancient custom which in the  course of centuries has degenerated into a religious observance. The  institution of the women of Amon is a legacy from a time when the  practice of polyandry obtained, and marriage did not yet exist.

There are  also three separate and independent tail stocks fitting into the two  openings between the ways. The running head has one cone pulley  connected by suitable gearing to three face plates. The three centers  at the running head are stationary. The slide rest saddle spans the  three ways, having a V slide which contains three separate slide  rests, all connected by a nut to the feed screw, so that all three are  operated by the one screw. In addition to this, the two back slide  rests have the nuts so attached that they can be moved by means of a  separate screw, the object being to facilitate setting the cuts, since  it would be a tedious matter to set all three tools to an equal cut,  or to their desired respective cuts, without means of operating two of  them independently. To set the cut during screw-cutting operations,  the ingenious device shown in our engraving is provided. A represents  the cross-feed or slide rest screw, which operates the three slide  rests. It is fast to the notched wheel, B, and is operated by it in  the usual way. C is a short screw which provides journal bearing for  the screw, A, by a plain hole. It is screwed on the outside, and the  plate in which it fits acts as its nut. It is fast to the handle, D,  and is in fact operated by it. The handle or lever is provided with a  catch, E, pivoted in the enclosed box, F, which also contains a means  of detaining the catch in the notches of the wheel, or of holding it  free from the same when it is placed clear. If, then, the lever, D, be  moved back and forth the feed screw, A, and hence the three slide  rests, will be operated; while, if the catch be placed in one of the  notches on the wheel, B, both the screws, A and C, will act to operate  the rests. When, therefore, the operator is cutting screws, he sets  the catch, E, into one of the notches so soon as the tools are  properly adjusted to the work; and then lifting the catch, E, he turns  the wheel, B, so that the catch falls into the next notch, and this  puts the cut on. When the tool has taken that cut, and while the  latter saddle is traveling back, the catch is placed in the next  notch, and so on, the cut for the forward travel always being put on  as above while the saddle is traveling back. Thus is insured an  exactly equable amount of cut on the whole three rests. When the  lever, D, is not in use, the catch is removed from the wheel, B, and  is allowed to rest against the pins, G or A, provided for that  purpose. For piston rods, or for work such as cutting jack screws,  this lathe is very useful. It is obviously, however, a special tool.           *       *       *       *       *          NATURAL ORNAMENTS IN WINTER.      Now that the hedges are no longer green, and the trees stand black and  bare on the landscape, is the time to seek for endless variety and  beauty waiting to be admired in its turn. What miniature fairy glens  and grottoes are distributed over the hedge banks of our country  lanes! Mosses, delicate and beautiful, may be found in the interstices  of any old wall, or at the foot of almost any tree or shrub. In the  winter time mosses and lichens are found in fruit, and are beautiful  objects. A pocket microscope lens is essential for their proper  observation; and though the delicate carmine cups of the species known  as the cup moss, and the familiar gray and yellow mosaic appearance we  see on twigs and branches on our way, are easily recognized, the study  of this form of winter vegetation is an inexhaustible one, and is an  occupation for a lifetime, if earnestly pursued. We do not however,  suggest that every one who endeavors to recognize the different  species of moss, lichens, or fungi should necessarily do so through  the medium of the microscope; but it will greatly add to the pleasure  of making a collection out of doors if there be a good microscope at  home, so that when the contents of the basket be turned out, after the  winter's walk, there should be interest even in the fragments left,  after a little pile of varied bits has been constructed, rivalling the  choicest summer bouquet in beauty of form and color. We have seen such  a collection formed into a beautiful object by raising a little mound  of rough bits of bark in a plate or saucer, and placing on it  varieties of fungus of every shade of red, brown, yellow, and gray.  They seem to spring forth from a bed of sphagnum or bog moss of  brightest emerald green; while a clump of the screw wall moss in  fruit, with its curious little box-like capsules, supports a gray or  yellow lichen, which has been gently removed from some old wall or  tree. A bit of stick or a twig, incrusted with a bright orange-colored  lichen, supports a trailing branch of delicate green ivy, the most  beautiful and adaptable of all winter foliage. Over this little  arrangement is placed a bell glass, to preserve it from dust and the  effect of a dry atmosphere; and we know how pleasing to the eye is its  varied beauty of form and color, lasting thus, a constant source of  pleasure, for many a day without renewal.--_Chambers' Journal_.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED HARNESS COCKEYE.      We illustrate herewith a very simple little device for attaching  traces to the single tree. It forms a secure fastening which may be  instantly attached, and which, by its construction, is prevented from  wearing out rapidly.    [Illustration: Figs. 1 and 2]    Fig. 1 shows the cockeye attached to the single tree, and Fig. 2  exhibits parts in section, displaying the construction very clearly.  The yoke is of the usual pattern. Swiveled to it is a long loop, which  is chambered out to receive a spiral spring which acts upon a plunger.  The latter is provided with a follower having a semicircular notch,  which corresponds in form to the inside of the end of the loop. The  follower also has guiding lips which extend over the sides of the  loop. Through the yielding of the spring, the space between the  follower and loop adjusts itself to studs or hooks of any size.  Patented December 12, 1876, through the Scientific American Patent  Agency.

For a time, it  occupied here some public attention, but only in a sensational way;  and the sober discussion of the subject, which followed after its  novelty had worn off, led to the general opinion that, while every one  might be quite willing to see his dead neighbors cremated, no one  would acquiesce in the disposal of his friends and relatives in so  abnormal a manner. Hence, with the single exception of the late  revolting exhibition in Pennsylvania, which we alluded to at the time,  the dead in this country have continued to be deposited in their  hallowed resting places, and have not been packed away, in an  incinerated state, in labeled urns. In Europe, however, cremation  still finds many warm adherents; and during last summer a congress of  the \"Friends of Cremation\" (a society which, we are informed by  _Engineering_, whence we take the annexed engravings, has branches in  various parts of the world), was held in Dresden. Before this meeting,  a large number of designs for cremation and mortuary buildings were  brought in competition, and finally the prize was awarded to Mr. G.  Lilienthal, a Berlin architect, for the imposing structure illustrated  herewith.    This will be the grand temple of cremation when it is erected--a  proceeding to take place in the dim future: when or where not stated.  On each side of a central chapel there is a circular memorial hall;  and extending so as to inclose the garden of the establishment, on the  sides of the halls are wings containing a large number of niches for  the reception of funeral urns.    The cremation ceremony is proposed to be as follows: The body, having  been brought into the hall, is subjected to the usual medical  examination; or when an inquest is necessary, it is removed to offices  in another part of the building, where the required investigation can  be held. When all is ready, the body, placed on the platform, B, Fig.  2, is raised by a lift into the hall, A, where visitors are gathered,  and here the result of the medical examination is declared, and  whatever preliminary religious ceremonies that are desired are  performed. The body is then transported to the chapel, E, in front of  the pulpit, F, where the burial service is performed. The bier is  afterward lowered mechanically, and brought to the furnaces, which are  arranged in a semicircle and partitioned for the reception of several  biers. The ashes are subsequently placed in an urn, on which the  name, etc., of the deceased are recorded, and which is set up in a  suitable niche.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--DESIGN FOR A CREMATION TEMPLE]    The building, which we illustrate both in elevation, Fig. 1, and in  plan, Fig. 2, is designed to contain 100,000 urns, and is adapted for  a town of 200,000 inhabitants. The architect has certainly exhibited  much taste in his design for the building, and has provided every  convenience in the internal arrangement for carrying on a large  business in the cremation line.
