The day is passing.  You have no time to lose. The white steed of the plains is coming to the  starting-post. Jump on my back, and remember, 'Faint heart never won  fair lady.'\"    In half a second Fergus was bestride the Pooka, whose coat of shaggy  hair became at once as glossy as silk, and just at the very moment  when the king was about to declare there was no steed to compete with  the white steed of the plains, the Pooka, with Fergus upon his back,  galloped up in front of the royal inclosure. When the people saw the  champion a thunderous shout rose up that startled the birds in the  skies, and sent them flying to the groves.    And in the ladies' inclosure was a rustle of many-colored scarves waving  in the air. At the striking of the shields the contending steeds rushed  from the post with the swiftness of a swallow's flight. But before the  white steed of the plains had gone halfway round, Fergus and the wild  horse of the mountains had passed the winning post, greeted by such  cheers as had never before been heard on the plains of Tara.    Fergus heard the cheers, but scarcely heeded them, for his heart went  out through his eyes that were fastened on the princess, and a wild hope  stirred him that his glance was not ungrateful to the loveliest lady of  the land.    And the princess was sad and sorry for her vow, for she believed that it  was beyond the power of Fergus to bring her a robe of all the colors of  the rainbow, so subtly woven as to fit in the palm of her soft, white  hand.    That night also Fergus went to the forest, not too sad, because there  was a vague hope in his heart that had never been there before. He lay  down under the branches, with his feet towards the rustling waters, and  the smiles of the princess gilded his slumbers, as the rays of the  rising sun gild the glades of the forest; and when the morning came he  was scarcely surprised when before him appeared the little old woman  with the shuttle he had welcomed on the winter's night.    \"You think you have won her already,\" said the little woman. \"And so you  have, too; her heart is all your own, and I'm half inclined to think  that my trouble will be thrown away, for if you had never a wedding robe  to give her, she'd rather have you this minute than all the kings of  Erin, or than all the other princes and kings and chieftains in the  whole world. But you and your father and mother were kind to me on a  wild winter's night, and I'd never see your mother's son without a  wedding robe fit for the greatest princess that ever set nations to  battle for her beauty. So go and pluck me a handful of wild forest  flowers, and I'll weave out of them a wedding robe with all the colors  of the rainbow, and one that will be as sweet and as fragrant as the  ripe, red lips of the princess herself.\"    Fergus, with joyous heart, culled the flowers, and brought them to the  little old woman.    In the twinkling of an eye she wove with her little shuttle a wedding  robe, with all the colors of the rainbow, as light as the fairy dew, as  soft as the hand of the princess, as fragrant as her little red mouth,  and so small that it would pass through the eye of a needle.    \"Go now, Fergus,\" said she, \"and may luck go with you; but, in the days  of your greatness and of the glory which will come to you when you are  wedded to the princess, be as kind, and have as open a heart and as open  a door for the poor as you had when you were only a poor huntsman's son.\"    Fergus took the robe and went towards Tara. It was the last day of the  fair, and all the contests were over, and the bards were about to chant  the farewell strains to the memory of the great queen. But before the  chief bard could ascend the mound, Fergus, attended by a troop of Fenian  warriors on their steeds, galloped into the inclosure, and rode up in  front of the queen's pavilion. Holding up the glancing and many-colored  robe, he said:    \"O Queen and King of Erin! I claim the princess for my bride. You,  O king, have decided that I have won the prize in the contest of the  bards; that I have won the prize in the race against the white steed of  the plains; it is for the princess to say if the robe which I give her  will fit in the hollow of her small white hand.\"    \"Yes,\" said the king. \"You are victor in the contests; let the princess  declare if you have fulfilled the last condition.\"    The princess took the robe from Fergus, closed her fingers over it, so  that no vestige of it was seen.    \"Yes, O king!\" said she, \"he has fulfilled the last condition; but  before ever he had fulfilled a single one of them, my heart went out to  the comely champion of the Feni. I was willing then, I am ready now, to  become the bride of the huntsman's son.\"          THE FAIRY TREE OF DOOROS[10]      Once upon a time the fairies of the west, going home from a  hurling-match with the fairies of the lakes, rested in Dooros Wood for  three days and three nights. They spent the days feasting and the nights  dancing in the light of the moon, and they danced so hard that they wore  the shoes off their feet, and for a whole week after the leprechauns,  the fairies' shoemakers, were working night and day making new ones, and  the rip, rap, tap, tap of their little hammers were heard in all the  hedgerows.    The food on which the fairies feasted was little red berries, which were  so like those that grow on the rowan tree that if you only looked at  them you might mistake one for the other; but the fairy berries grow  only in fairyland, and are sweeter than any fruit that grows here in  this world, and if an old man, bent and gray, ate one of them, he became  young and active and strong again; and if an old woman, withered and  wrinkled, ate one of them, she became young and bright and fair; and if  a little maiden who was not handsome ate of them, she became lovelier  than the flower of beauty.    The fairies guarded the berries as carefully as a miser guards his gold,  and whenever they were about to leave fairyland they had to promise in  the presence of the king and queen that they would not give a single  berry to mortal man, nor allow one to fall upon the earth; for if a  single berry fell upon the earth a slender tree of many branches,  bearing clusters of berries, would at once spring up, and mortal men  might eat of them.    But it chanced that this time they were in Dooros Wood they kept up the  feasting and dancing so long, and were so full of joy because of their  victory over the lake fairies, that one little, weeny fairy, not much  bigger than my finger, lost his head, and dropped a berry in the wood.    When the feast was ended the fairies went back to fairyland, and were at  home for more than a week before they knew of the little fellow's fault,  and this is how they came to know of it.    A great wedding was about to come off, and the queen of the fairies sent  six of her pages to Dooros Wood to catch fifty butterflies with golden  spots on their purple wings, and fifty white without speck or spot, and  fifty golden, yellow as the cowslip, to make a dress for herself, and a  hundred white, without speck or spot, to make dresses for the bride and  bridesmaids.    When the pages came near the wood they heard the most wonderful music,  and the sky above them became quite dark, as if a cloud had shut out  the sun. They looked up, and saw that the cloud was formed of bees, who  in a great swarm were flying towards the wood and humming as they flew.  Seeing this they were sore afraid until they saw the bees settling on a  single tree, and on looking closely at the tree they saw it was covered  with fairy berries.    The bees took no notice of the fairies, and so they were no longer  afraid, and they hunted the butterflies until they had captured the full  number of various colors. Then they returned to fairyland, and they told  the queen about the bees and the berries, and the queen told the king.    The king was very angry, and he sent his heralds to the four corners of  fairyland to summon all his subjects to his presence that he might find  out without delay who was the culprit.    They all came except the little weeny fellow who dropped the berry, and  of course everyone said that it was fear that kept him away, and that he  must be guilty.    The heralds were at once sent in search of him, and after a while they  found him hiding in a cluster of ferns, and brought him before the king.    The poor little fellow was so frightened that at first he could scarcely  speak a word, but after a time he told how he never missed the berry  until he had returned to fairyland, and that he was afraid to say  anything to anyone about it.    The king, who would hear of no excuse, sentenced the little culprit to  be banished into the land of giants beyond the mountains, to stay there  for ever and a day unless he could find a giant willing to go to Dooros  Wood and guard the fairy tree. When the king had pronounced sentence  everyone was very sorry, because the little fellow was a favorite with  them all. No fairy harper upon his harp, or piper upon his pipe, or  fiddler upon his fiddle, could play half so sweetly as he could play  upon an ivy leaf; and when they remembered all the pleasant moonlit  nights on which they had danced to his music, and thought that they  should never hear or dance to it any more, their little hearts were  filled with sorrow. The queen was as sad as any of her subjects, but  the king's word should be obeyed.    When the time came for the little fellow to set out into exile the queen  sent her head page to him with a handful of berries. These the queen  said he was to offer to the giants, and say at the same time that the  giant who was willing to guard the tree could feast on"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22169"],[0,"The Story of the Barbary Corsairs (#12)"],[1,"west to the eastern basin of the Mediterranean, and to leave it in  the Corsairs' hands was to the last degree hazardous. Accordingly he  espoused the cause of Hasan, and at the end of May, 1535, he set sail  from Barcelona with six hundred ships commanded by Doria (who had his  own grudge to settle), and carrying the flower of the Imperial troops,  Spaniards, Italians, and Germans. In June he laid siege to the  Goletta--or _halk-el-w[=e]d_, \"throat of the torrent,\" as the Arabs  called it--those twin towers a mile asunder which guarded the channel  of Tunis. The great carack _St. Ann_, sent, with four galleys, by \"the  Religion\" (so the Knights of Malta styled their Order), was moored  close in, and her heavy cannon soon made a breach, through which the  Chevalier Cossier led the Knights of St. John, who always claimed the  post of danger, into the fortress, and planted the banner of \"the  Religion\" on the battlements[30] (14 July). Three desperate sallies  had the besieged made under the leadership of Sin[=a]n the Jew; three  Italian generals of rank had fallen in the melley; before they were  driven in confusion back upon the city of Tunis, leaving the Goletta  with all its stores of weapons and ammunition, and its forty guns,  some of them famous for their practice at the siege of Rhodes, and  more than a hundred vessels, in the hands of the enemy. Barbarossa  came out to meet the emperor at the head of nearly ten thousand  troops; but his Berbers refused to fight, the thousands of Christian  slaves in the Kasaba (or citadel), aided by treachery, broke their  chains and shut the gates behind him; and, after defending his rampart  as long as he could, the Corsair chief, with Sin[=a]n and Ayd[=i]n  \"Drub-Devil,\" made his way to Bona, where he had fortunately left  fifteen of his ships. The lines of Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n's triple wall may  still be traced across the neck of land which separates the lake of  Tunis from the Mediterranean. Fifteen years ago this rampart was cut  through, when nearly two hundred skeletons, some Spanish money, cannon  balls, and broken weapons were found outside it.[31]    For three days Charles gave up the city of Tunis to the brutality of  his soldiers. They were days of horrible license and bloodshed. Men,  women, and children were massacred, and worse than massacred, in  thousands. The infuriated troops fought one with the other for the  possession of the spoil, and the luckless Christians of the Kasaba were  cut down by their deliverers in the struggle for Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n's  treasures. The streets became shambles, the houses dens of murder and  shame: the very Catholic chroniclers admit the abominable outrages  committed by the licentious and furious soldiery of the great Emperor.  It is hard to remember that almost at the very time when German and  Spanish and Italian men-at-arms were outraging and slaughtering  helpless, innocent people in Tunis, who had taken little or no hand in  Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n's wars and had accepted his authority with reluctance,  the Grand Vez[=i]r Ibrah[=i]m was entering Baghd[=a]d and Tebr[=i]z as  a conqueror at the head of wild Asiatic troops, and not a house nor a  human being was molested. _Fas est et ab hoste doceri._    So far as Tunis was concerned the expedition of Charles V. was  fruitless. Before he sailed in August he made a treaty with Hasan,  which stipulated for tribute to Spain, the possession of the Goletta  by the crown of Castile, the freeing of Christian slaves, the  cessation of piracy, and the payment of homage by an annual tribute  of six Moorish barbs and twelve falcons; and he and the Moor duly  swore it on Cross and sword. But the treaty was so much parchment  wasted. No Moslem prince who had procured his restoration by such  means as Hasan had used, who had spilt Moslem blood with Christian  weapons and ruined Moslem homes by the sacrilegious atrocities of  \"infidel\" soldiers, and had bound himself the vassal of \"idolatrous\"  Spain, could hope to keep his throne long. He was an object of horror  and repulsion to the people upon whom he had brought this awful  calamity, and so fierce was their scorn of the traitor to Islam that  the story is told of a Moorish girl in the clutch of the soldiers,  who, when the restored King of Tunis sought to save her, spat in his  face; anything was better than the dishonour of his protection. Hasan  pretended to reign for five years, but the country was in arms, holy  Kayraw[=a]n would have nothing to say to a governor who owed his  throne to infidel ravishers; Imperial troops in vain sought to keep  him there; Doria himself succeeded only for a brief while in reducing  the coast towns to the wretched prince's authority; and in 1540 Hasan  was imprisoned and blinded by his son Ham[=i]d, and none can pity him.  The coast was in the possession of the Corsairs, and, as we shall see,  even the Spaniards were forced ere long to abandon the Goletta.    Nevertheless, the expedition to Tunis was a feat of which Europe was  proud. Charles V. seldom suffered from depreciation of his exploits,  and, as Morgan quaintly says, \"I have never met with that Spaniard in  my whole life, who, I am persuaded, would not have bestowed on me at  least forty _Boto a Christo's_, had I pretended to assert Charles V.  not to have held this whole universal globe in a string for  four-and-twenty hours; and _then it broke_: though none had ever the  good nature or manners to inform or correct my ignorance in genuine  history, by letting me into the secret when that critical and slippery  period of time was.\"[32] Naturally admirers so thoroughgoing made the  most of the conquest of Tunis, the reduction of the formidable  Goletta, the release of thousands of Christian captives, and, above  all, the discomfiture of that scourge of Christendom, Barbarossa  himself. Poets sang of it, a painter-in-ordinary depicted the siege, a  potter at Urbino burnt the scene into his vase; all Europe was agog  with enthusiasm at the feat. Charles posed as a crusader and a  knight-errant, and commemorated his gallant deeds and those of his  gentlemen by creating a new order of chivalry, the Cross of Tunis,  with the motto \"Barbaria,\" of which however we hear no more.  Altogether \"it was a famous victory.\"    The joy of triumph was sadly marred by the doings of Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n.  That incorrigible pirate, aware that no one would suspect that he  could be roving while Charles was besieging his new kingdom, took  occasion to slip over to Minorca with his twenty-seven remaining  galleots; and there, flying Spanish and other false colours, deceived  the islanders into the belief that his vessels were part of the  Armada; upon which he rowed boldly into Port Mahon, seized a rich  Portuguese galleon, sacked the town, and, laden with six thousand  captives and much booty and ammunition, led his prize back in triumph  to Algiers. In the meanwhile Doria was assiduously hunting for him  with thirty galleys, under the emperor's express orders to catch him  dead or alive. The great Genoese had to wait yet three years for his  long-sought duel.    Having accomplished its object, the Armada, as usual, broke up without  making a decisive end of the Corsairs. Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n, waiting at  Algiers in expectation of attack, heard the news gladly, and, when the  coast was clear, sailed back to Constantinople for reinforcements. He  never saw Algiers again.      FOOTNOTES:    [29] Von Hammer, _Gesch. d. Osm. Reiches_, ii. 129.

When Barbarossa returned to Constantinople Tunis was forgotten and  Minorca alone called to mind: instead of the title of Beglerbeg of  Algiers, the Sultan saluted him as Capudan Pasha or High Admiral of  the Ottoman fleets. There was work to be done in the Adriatic, and  none was fitter to do it than the great Corsair. Kheyr-ed-d[=i]n had  acquired an added influence at Stambol since the execution of the  Grand Vez[=i]r Ibrah[=i]m,[33] and he used it in exactly the opposite  direction. Ibrah[=i]m, a Dalmatian by birth, had always striven to  maintain friendly relations with Venice, his native state, and for  more than thirty years there had been peace between the Republic and  the Porte. Barbarossa, on the contrary, longed to pit his galleys  against the most famous of the maritime nations of the Middle Ages,  and to make the Crescent as supreme in the waters of the Adriatic as  it was in the Aegean. Francis I. was careful to support this policy  out of his jealousy of the Empire. The Venetians, anxious to keep on  good terms with the Sultan, and to hold a neutral position between  Francis and Charles V., found themselves gradually committed to a war,  and by their own fault. Their commanders in the Adriatic and at Candia  were unable to resist the temptation of chasing Ottoman merchantmen.  Canale, the Proveditore of Candia, caught a noted Corsair, the \"Young  Moor of Alexander,\" as his victims called him, sunk or captured his  galleys, killed his Janissaries, and severely wounded the young Moor  himself;--and all this in Turkish waters, on Turkish subjects, and in  time of peace. Of course when the too gallant Proveditore came to his  senses and perceived his folly, he patched the young Moor's wounds and  sent him tenderly back to Algiers: but the Sultan's ire was already  roused, and when Venetian "]]]
