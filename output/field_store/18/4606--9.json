The gable window contains six figures of the Patriarchs,       with a figure of our Lord in the centre; some of which were       executed by Mr. Howes and others by Mr. Preedy: the gift of       some of the Peers and Prelates educated at the University of       Cambridge.         The middle window of the western aisle, by M. Lusson; the       subjects taken from the Book of Jeremiah: given by the Rev.       G. Rous, Laverton, as a memorial of Dr. Hugh Thomas,       nineteenth Dean of Ely.         The north window is also by a French artist, and given by       the late Canon E.B. Sparke.    The piece of tessellated pavement in the floor was found some years  ago between the Choir and the Lady Chapel, under the present level of  the earth, and was placed here for preservation; when the floor of  this arm of the Transept is re-laid, this may perhaps be again  inserted, or removed to some other place.      +The Octagon.+    We now come to this special glory of the Cathedral, \"in which,\" says  Mr. Millers, \"elegance, magnificence, and strength are so happily  blended, that it is impossible to determine in which respect it is  most admirable.\" We follow up the description nearly in his own words.  Here stood originally a square Norman tower, which in the year 1322,  from the unequal pressure of the four parts of the church, gave way  and fell eastward, crushing in its fall several adjoining arches. \"It  could not have happened at a more favourable conjuncture; as the  convent was rich, spirited, and liberal; and though another great work  had been begun the preceding year, (the erection of a new Lady  Chapel,) the repair of this great dilapidation was immediately  undertaken, and completed in a few years, by Alan de Walsingham, at  that time sacrist,[34] an officer under whose particular charge were  all the monastic buildings. It has continued above five hundred years,  and may it yet continue a noble proof of his consummate skill as an  architect!\" The conception was original, being perhaps the first  building of the kind ever erected. By throwing the weight upon eight  strong piers and arches instead of four, he has probably guarded  against the recurrence of a similar accident; at the same time he has  given a larger space, a more agreeable form, and greater scope for  embellishment, which is, however, most judiciously confined within  such limits as not to interfere with sober and impressive grandeur. No  one can behold it without admiring the skill which has suspended,  rather than supported, a very heavy timber roof over so wide an area  without a pillar.    [Footnote 34: He was made Sub-Prior, then Prior, and elected Bishop,  A.D. 1344, but the election was not confirmed.]    \"It is not equilateral; there are four longer and four shorter sides,  alternate and respectively equal. Four lofty arches, in the four  longer sides, open into the four principal parts of the church:  alternately with these, in the four shorter sides, are as many more,  much lower, opening obliquely into the aisles above and below the  Transept. The arches are all supported by elegant clustered and  conjoined columns, and their capitals are wreaths of flowers and  foliage.\"    In the shorter sides there is room for some ornamentation, but the  ornaments are chaste and not profuse. The four low arches in them are  under canopies resting on good carved heads, which remain perfect.  Those on the north-east are said to be intended for Edward III. and  his queen Phillippa, in whose time the building was erected; on the  south-eastern arch are represented the heads of a bishop and a priest,  perhaps meant for Bishop Hotham and Prior Crauden, superiors at the  period of erection. On the north-west arch are the heads of another  priest, apparently younger, and of some secular person with long hair;  the former is supposed to represent Alan de Walsingham, the skilful  architect of this noble work; and the latter the chief mason. On the  remaining arch are two figures, the meaning of which we can scarcely  comprehend.    A little above each of these lower arches are three brackets, or  corbels, with canopies; the original figures (if any) placed on these  brackets have long since disappeared, but the spaces have lately been  filled with sitting figures of the Apostles,[35] executed in stone by  Mr. Redfern, each holding a symbolical instrument. If we start from  the Choir and proceed to the right hand we shall find them placed in  the following order:--          {  St. Matthew--box.  S.E.  {  St. John--chalice and dragon.        {  St. James, minor--club.          {  St. Philip--small cross.  S.W.  {  St. Paul--sword.        {  St. Bartholomew--knife.          {  St. Thomas--mason's square.  N.W.  {  St. Peter--keys.        {  St. Andrew--cross.          {  St. Jude--spear.  N.E.  {  St. James, major--pilgrim's staff.        {  St. Simon--saw.    [Footnote 35: These were contributed by the Bishop of Carlisle (5),  Dr. Kennedy, Sir G.G. Scott, Captain Horton, Canon Underwood, and  others.]    There are also sixteen small stone heads, four connected with each  group of three Apostles, which are not very clearly seen, perhaps,  from the floor of the Cathedral, but which, when examined, shew by the  conventual prophetic cap given to them, that they are intended to  represent the sixteen Prophets of the Old Testament. Above these  canopies, in each of the four sides, is a gallery or passage with an  embattled parapet, and above that a large window of four lights with  geometrical tracery; it is extremely sharp pointed, and towards the  top each window is faced internally with a trellis or lattice-work of  stone, which adds to its elegance without intercepting the light.  These windows rise to the same height as the higher arches; they have  been filled with stained glass by Mr. Wailes, and the subjects are  chiefly representations of persons who were instrumental in the  foundation, erection, or restoration of the Cathedral, of the reigning  sovereigns at the respective periods, and of others who figured in the  traditionary history of the foundress.         The window in the south-east angle is designed to       commemorate the principal persons who figured in the       traditionary history of the foundress. The figures in the       upper tier represent Anna, father of St. Etheldreda; St.       Etheldreda as queen; Tonbert, her first, and Egfrid, her       second husband. In the lower tier, St. Etheldreda as abbess;       Wilfred Bishop of York; St. Erminilda, the third abbess; and       St. Sexburga, the second abbess. The tracery contains other       figures and emblems, with the arms of the donor, the late       Canon E.B. Sparke.         The window in the north-east angle, in continuation of the       same design, contains in the upper tier figures representing       St. Withburga, St. Edmond, St. Werberga, fourth abbess of       Ely, and Archbishop Dunstan. In the lower tier, Bishop       Ethelwold; Brithnoth, Duke of Northumberland; Abbot       Brithnoth, and King Edgar. The tracery contains the arms of       the University of Cambridge, with other figures and devices:       contributed by subscriptions from the Bachelors and       Undergraduates of the University of Cambridge.         The window in the north-west angle also contains eight       representative figures, viz., in the upper tier, (reading       from right to left) are William I., Henry I., Henry III.,       and Edward II.; and under these, Abbot Simeon, who commenced       the present Cathedral; Harvey, the first Bishop of Ely;       Bishop Northwold, who erected the Presbytery; and Alan de       Walsingham, the skilful architect of the Octagon. The       tracery contains medallions in which are pictured the       shrine of St. Etheldreda; Abbot Simeon laying the foundation       stone of the Cathedral; Alan de Walsingham and monks weeping       over the ruins of the central tower; the arms of the       University of Cambridge, of the See of Ely, of Bishop       Sparke, with other devices. Half the cost of this window was       defrayed by subscriptions from some graduates of the       University of Cambridge, and the other half by a portion of       the accumulation of the money given by Bishop Sparke[36] for       the east window.         [Footnote 36: Bishop Sparke gave L1500 stock in the Reduced       Three per cents. about 1833, but the east window was not       completed until 1857; the amount had in the mean time       accumulated considerably, and proved sufficient to defray       the cost of the east window, of six windows in the       clerestory of the Choir, of the four windows of the       triforium of the Presbytery, and half the cost of the       north-west window of the Octagon.]         The window in the south-west angle also contains eight       figures in the four principal lights, arranged in the       following order--the Queen in her coronation robes; the       Prince Consort in his robes as Chancellor of the University       of Cambridge; and under these are represented Dr. Turton,       the then bishop, and Dr. Peacock, the then dean of Ely;       these figures being commemorative of the present extensive       restorations: the other four represent King Edward III. and       his queen Philippa, in whose reign the Octagon was built;       and under these, Bishop Hotham and Prior Crauden, the great       officers of the Cathedral at that period. The tracery       contains the arms of the University of Cambridge in the       centre, and on either side the arms respectively of those       whose figures are represented in the window. The cost of a       portion of this was graciously defrayed by Her Majesty;       Bishop Turton and Dean Peacock gave the cost of their own       figures respectively, and the remainder was paid by the       capitular body.

It was at the same time expressly enacted that  all the Christian inhabitants should be in the enjoyment of every right  and privilege as free as the natural-born subjects of England. If Roger  Williams was the first to proclaim absolute religious liberty, Lord  Baltimore was hardly behind him in putting this into practice. As has  been neatly said, \"The Ark and the Dove were names of happy omen: the  one saved from the general wreck the germs of political liberty, and the  other bore the olive-branch of religious peace.\"    [1646]    During the civil war in England the affairs of Maryland were in a very  disturbed condition. Clayborne, Maryland's evil genius, seized the  opportunity to foment an insurrection, possessed himself once more of  Kent Island, and compelled the governor to flee to Virginia. Returning  in 1646, Calvert was fortunate enough to recover the reins of  government, but the following year witnessed the close of his  administration and his short though useful and eventful life. Few men  intrusted with almost absolute authority have exercised it with so much  firmness and at the same time with so much ability, discretion, and  uprightness.    [1650]    His successor, Greene, a Catholic, was not likely to find favor with the  Puritan Parliament of England, and Baltimore, in 1648, to conciliate the  ruling powers and to refute the charge that Maryland was only a retreat  for Romanists, removed the governor and appointed instead one who was a  Protestant and a firm supporter of Parliament. The council was also  changed so as to place the Catholics in the minority. The oath of the  new governor restrained him from molesting any person, especially if of  the Roman Catholic persuasion, on account of religious profession. The  way was thus opened for the Act of Toleration passed in 1649. This law,  after specifying certain speeches against the Trinity, the Virgin, or  the saints as punishable offences, declared that equal privileges should  be enjoyed by Christians of all creeds. Whatever the motives of  Baltimore, his policy was certainly wise and commendable.    A new and troublesome element was now introduced into the colony. Some  Puritans who had not been tolerated among the stanch Church-of-England  inhabitants of Virginia were invited by Governor Stone to Maryland.  Their home here, which they named Providence, is now known as Annapolis.  The new-comers objected to the oath of fidelity, refused to send  burgesses to the assembly, and were ready to overthrow the government  whose protection they were enjoying. Opportunity soon offered.  Parliament had already in 1652 brought Virginia to submission. Maryland  was now accused of disloyalty, and when we notice among the  commissioners appointed by the Council of State, the name of Clayborne,  it is not difficult to understand who was the author of this charge. The  governor was removed, but being popular and not averse to compromise,  was quickly restored. Then came the accession of Cromwell to power as  Protector of England. Parliament was dissolved.  The authority of its  commissioners of course ceased. Baltimore seized this opportunity to  regain his position as proprietary. He bade Stone to require the oath of  fidelity to the proprietary from those who occupied lands, and to issue  all writs in his name. He maintained that the province now stood in the  same relations to the Protectorate which it had borne to the royalist  government of Charles I.    [Illustration: Oliver Cromwell.]    So thought Cromwell, but not so Clayborne or the Maryland Puritans. They  deposed Stone, and put in power Fuller, who was in sympathy with their  designs. There resulted a reversal of the acts of former assemblies, and  legislation hostile to the Catholics. The new assembly, from which  Catholics were carefully excluded by disfranchisement, at once repealed  the Act of Toleration. Protection was withdrawn from those who professed  the popish religion, and they were forbidden the exercise of that faith  in the province. Severe penalties were threatened against \"prelacy\" and  \"licentiousness\" thus restricting the benefits of their \"Act concerning  Religion\" to the Puritan element now in power. The authority of the  proprietary himself was disputed, and colonists were invited to take  lands without his knowledge or consent.    [1656]    Baltimore adopted vigorous measures. By his orders Stone made a forcible  attempt to regain control of the province, but was defeated at  Providence and taken prisoner. His life was spared, but four of his men  were condemned and executed. Baltimore again invoked the powerful  intervention of Cromwell, and again were the enemies of Maryland sternly  rebuked for their interference in the affairs of that province, and told  in plain language to leave matters as they had found them. In 1656,  after an inquiry by the Commissioners of Trade, the claims of Baltimore  were admitted to be just, and he promptly sent his brother Philip to be  a member of the council and secretary of the province. The legislation  of the usurping Puritans was set aside, religious toleration once more  had full sway, and a general pardon was proclaimed to those who had  taken part in the late disturbances.    In the meantime, Fendall, who had been appointed governor by Baltimore,  plotted to make himself independent of his master, and, with the  connivance of the assembly, proceeded to usurp the authority which was  lawfully vested in the proprietary. But the attempt was a miserable  failure.  Philip Calvert was immediately made governor by the now  all-powerful proprietary, who had the favor and support of Charles II.,  just coming to the throne. Peace and prosperity came back to the colony  so sorely and frequently vexed by civil dissensions. The laws were just  and liberal, encouraging the advent of settlers of whatever creed, while  the rule of the Calverts was wise and benign, such as to merit the  respect and admiration of posterity. In 1643 Virginia and Maryland  together had less than twenty thousand inhabitants. In 1660 Maryland  alone, according to Fuller, had eight thousand. Chalmers thinks there  were no fewer than twelve thousand at this date.        CHAPTER VII.    NEW NETHERLAND    [1609]    While the French explorer, Champlain, was sailing along the shores of  the lake which bears his name, another equally adventurous spirit, Henry  Hudson, was on his way to the western world. Hoping to open a passage to  India by a voyage to the north, Hudson, an English navigator, offered in  1609 to sail under the authority of the Dutch East India Company. Driven  back by ice and fog from a northeast course, he turned northwest.  Searching up and down near the parallel of 40 degrees, he entered the  mouth of the great river which perpetuates his name. He found the  country inviting to the eye, and occupied by natives friendly in  disposition. The subsequent career of this bold mariner has a mournful  interest. He never returned to Holland, but, touching at Dartmouth, was  restrained by the English authorities, and forbidden longer to employ  his skill and experience for the benefit of the Dutch. Again entering  the English service and sent once more to discover the northwest  passage, he sailed into the waters of the bay which still bears his  name, where cold and hunger transformed the silent discontent of his  crew into open mutiny, and they left the fearless navigator to perish  amid the icebergs of the frozen north.    [Illustration: Seal of New Amsterdam.]    [Illustration: Peter Stuyvesant.]    [1614-1618]    Hudson had sent to Holland a report of the Great River and the country  bordering it, rich in fur-bearing animals, and it had excited eager  interest. Private individuals sent expeditions thither and carried on a  profitable trade with the natives. A few Dutch were here when, in 1613,  Captain Argall sailed from Virginia against the French at Port Royal,  Acadia, now Annapolis in Nova Scotia, who were encroaching upon the  English possessions on the coast of Maine. He compelled them to  surrender. On his return, he visited the Dutch traders of Manhattan  Island, and forced them also, as it had been discovered by Cabot in  1497, to acknowledge the sovereignty of England over this entire region.    [Illustration: Seal of New Netherland.]    It was in 1614 that the Dutch States-General, in the charter given to a  company of merchants, named the Hudson Valley New Netherland. To  facilitate trade this company made a treaty with the Five Nations and  subordinate tribes, memorable as the first compact formed between the  whites and the savages. In it the Indians were regarded as possessing  equal rights and privileges with their white brethren. The treaty was  renewed in 1645, and continued in force till the English occupation,  1664. In 1618, the charter of the New Netherland Company having expired,  the Dutch West India Company was offered a limited incorporation, but it  was not until 1621 that it received its charter, and it was two years  later that it was completely organized and approved by the  States-General. By this company were sent out Mey, as Director, to the  Delaware or South River, and Tienpont to the Hudson or North River. Four  miles below Philadelphia Fort Nassau was erected, and where Albany now  stands was begun the trading-post called Fort Orange.    [1626]    In 1626 Tienpont's successor, Peter Minuit, a German, born at Wesel, was  appointed Director-General of New Netherland. He bought of the Indians,  for the sum of twenty-four dollars, the entire island of Manhattan, and  a fort called New Amsterdam was built. The State of New York dates its  beginning from this transaction.
