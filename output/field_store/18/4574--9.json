[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20461"],[0,"German Culture Past and Present (#12)"],[1,"now in our  times so great commotion in faith come upon us. There is one in Saxony  who is called Luther, of whom many pious and honest folk tell how that  he doth write so consolingly the good evangelical (_evangelische_)  truth. But again I hear that the Pope and the cardinals at Rome have  put him under the ban as a heretic; and certain of our own preachers,  too, scold him from their pulpits as a knave, a misleader, and a  heretic. I am utterly confounded, and know not where to turn; albeit  my reason and heart do speak to me even as Luther writeth. But yet  again it bethinks me that when the Pope, the cardinal, the bishop, the  doctor, the monk, and the priest, for the greater part are against  him, and so that all save the common men and a few gentlemen, doctors,  councillors, and knights, are his adversaries, what shall I do?\" \"For  answer, dear friend, get thee back and search the Scriptures, and thou  shalt find that so it hath gone with all the holy prophets even as it  now fareth with Doctor Martin Luther, who is in truth a godly  Christian and manly heart and only true Pope and Apostle, when he the  true office of the Apostles publicly fulfilleth.... If the godly man  Luther were pleasing to the world, that were indeed a true sign that  his doctrine were not from God; for the word of God is a fiery sword,  a hammer that breaketh in pieces the rocks, and not a fox's tail or a  reed that may be bent according to our pleasure.\" Seventeen noxious  qualities of the wolf are adduced--his ravenousness, his cunning, his  falseness, his cowardice, his thirst for robbery, amongst others. The  Popes, the cardinals, and the bishops are compared to the wolves in  all their attributes: \"The greater his pomp and splendour, the more  shouldst thou beware of such an one; for he is a wolf that cometh in  the shape of a good shepherd's dog. Beware! it is against the custom  of Christ and His Apostles.\" It is again but the song of the wolves  when they claim to mix themselves with worldly affairs and maintain  the temporal supremacy. The greediness of the wolf is discernible in  the means adopted to get money for the building of St. Peter's. The  interlocutor is warned against giving to mendicant priests and monks.    We have given this as a specimen of the almost purely theological  pamphlet; although, as will have been evident, even this is directly  connected with the material abuses from which the people were  suffering. Another pamphlet of about the same date deals with usury,  the burden of which had been greatly increased by the growth of the  new commercial combinations already referred to in the Introduction,  which combinations Dr. Eck had been defending at Bologna on  theological grounds, in order to curry favour with the Augsburg  merchant-prince, Fuggerschwatz.[9] It is called \"Concerning Dues.  Hither comes a poor peasant to a rich citizen. A priest comes also  thereby, and then a monk. Full pleasant to read.\" A peasant visits a  burgher when he is counting money, and asks him where he gets it all  from. \"My dear peasant,\" says the townsman, \"thou askest me who gave  me this money. I will tell thee. There cometh hither a peasant, and  beggeth me to lend him ten or twenty gulden. Thereupon I ask him an he  possesseth not a goodly meadow or corn-field. 'Yea! good sir!' saith  he, 'I have indeed a good meadow and a good corn-field. The twain are  worth a hundred gulden.' Then say I to him: 'Good, my friend, wilt  thou pledge me thy holding? and an thou givest me one gulden of thy  money every year I will lend thee twenty gulden now.' Then is the  peasant right glad, and saith he: 'Willingly will I pledge it thee.'  'I will warn thee,' say I, 'that an thou furnishest not the one gulden  of money each year, I will take thy holding for my own having.'  Therewith is the peasant well content, and writeth him down  accordingly. I lend him the money; he payeth me one year, or may be  twain, the due; thereafter can he no longer furnish it, and thereupon  I take the holding, and drive away the peasant therefrom. Thus I get  the holding and the money. The same things do I with handicraftsmen.  Hath he a good house? He pledgeth that house until I bring it behind  me. Therewith gain I much in goods and money, and thus do I pass my  days.\" \"I thought,\" rejoined the peasant, \"that 'twere only the Jew  who did usury, but I hear that ye also ply that trade.\" The burgher  answers that interest is not usury, to which the peasant replies that  interest (_Guelt_) is only a \"subtle name.\" The burgher then quotes  Scripture, as commanding men to help one another. The peasant readily  answers that in doing this they have no right to get advantage from  the assistance they proffer. \"Thou art a good fellow!\" says the  townsman. \"If I take no money for the money that I lend, how shall I  then increase my hoard?\" The peasant then reproaches him that he sees  well that his object in life is to wax fat on the substance of others;  \"But I tell thee, indeed,\" he says, \"that it is a great and heavy  sin.\" Whereupon his opponent waxes wroth, and will have nothing more  to do with him, threatening to kick him out in the name of a thousand  devils; but the peasant returns to the charge, and expresses his  opinion that rich men do not willingly hear the truth. A priest now  enters, and to him the townsman explains the dispute. \"Dear peasant,\"  says the priest, \"wherefore camest thou hither, that thou shouldst  make of a due[10] usury? May not a man buy with his money what he  will?\" But the peasant stands by his previous assertion, demanding  how anything can be considered as bought which is only a pledge. \"We  priests,\" replies the ecclesiastic, \"must perforce lend moneys for  dues, since thereby we get our living\"; to which, after sundry  ejaculations of surprise, the peasant retorts: \"Who gave to you the  power? I well hear ye have another God than we poor people. We have  our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath forbidden such money-lending for  gain.\" Hence it comes, he goes on, that land is no longer free; to  attempt to whitewash usury under the name of due or interest, he says,  is just the same as if one were to call a child christened Friedrich  or Hansel, Fritz or Hans, and then maintain it was no longer the same  child. They require no more Jews, he says, since the Christians have  taken their business in hand. The townsman is once more about to turn  the peasant out of his house when a monk enters. He then lays the  matter before the new-comer, who promises to talk the peasant over  with soft words; for, says he, there is nothing accomplished with  vainglory. He thereupon takes him aside and explains it to him by the  illustration of a merchant whose gain on the wares he sells is not  called usury, and argues that therefore other forms of gain in  business should not be described by this odious name. But the peasant  will have none of this comparison; for the merchant, he says, needs  to incur much risk in order to gain and traffic with his wares; while  money-lending on security is, on the other hand, without risk or  labour, and is a treacherous mode of cheating. Finding that they can  make nothing of the obstinate countryman, the others leave him; but  he, as a parting shot, exclaims: \"Ah, well-a-day! I would to have  talked with thee at first, but it is now ended. Farewell, gracious  sir, and my other kind sirs. I, poor little peasant, I go my way.  Farewell, farewell, due remains usury for ever more. Yea, yea! due,  indeed!\"    The above specimens of the popular writing of the time must suffice.  But for the reader who wishes to further study this literature we give  the titles, which sufficiently indicate their contents, of a selection  of other similar pamphlets and broadsheets: \"A New Epistle from the  Evil Clergy sent to their righteous Lord, with an answer from their  Lord. Most merry to read\" (1521). \"A Great Prize which the Prince of  Hell, hight Lucifer, now offereth to the Clergy, to the Pope, Bishops,  Cardinals, and their like\" (1521). \"A Written Call, made by the Prince  of Hell to his dear devoted, of all and every condition in his  kingdom\" (1521). \"Dialogue or Converse of the Apostolicum, Angelica,  and other spices of the Druggist, anent Dr. Martin Luther and his  disciples\" (1521). \"A Very Pleasant Dialogue and Remonstrance from the  Sheriff of Gaissdorf and his pupil against the pastor of the same and  his assistant\" (1521). The popularity of \"Karsthans,\" an anonymous  tract, amongst the people is illustrated by the publication and wide  distribution of a new \"Karsthans\" a few months later, in which it is  sought to show that the knighthood should make common cause with the  peasants, the _dramatis personae_ being Karsthans and Franz von  Sickingen. Referring to the same subject we find a \"Dialogue which  Franciscus von Sickingen held fore heaven's gate with St. Peter and  the Knights of St. George before he was let in.\" This was published in  1523, almost immediately after the death of Sickingen. \"A Talk between  a Nobleman, a Monk, and a Courtier\" (1523). \"A Talk between a Fox and  a Wolf\" (1523). \"A Pleasant Dialogue between Dr. Martin Luther and the  cunning Messenger from Hell\" (1523). \"A Conversation of the Pope with  his Cardinals of how it goeth with him, and how he may destroy the  Word of God. Let every man very well note\" (1523). \"A Christian and  Merry Talk, that it is more pleasing to God and more wholesome for men  to come out of the monasteries and to marry, than to tarry therein  and to burn; which talk is not with human folly and the false  teachings thereof, but is founded alone in the holy, divine, biblical,  and evangelical Scripture\" (1524). \"A Pleasant Dialogue of a Peasant  with a Monk that he should cast his Cowl from him. Merry and fair to  read\" (1525).    The above is only a selection taken haphazard from the mass of  fugitive literature which the early years of the Reformation brought "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20464"],[0,"A Journey Through France in War Time (#12)"],[1,"rtaud, and I must apologize, as my knowledge of English is far  from being adequate to my task. Anyhow, it is possible my words may  be by a few of our guests more easily translated than if delivered  in French.    Gentlemen, the oldest Chamber of Commerce in France, and maybe in  the world, is exceedingly proud of entertaining tonight the highly  qualified representatives of the American Commerce and Industry. We  are most thankful to your party to have agreed to spend some of  your valuable time in our city. We are sorry to say that we have  not this good fortune as often as we would like, and that your  fellow-citizens generally pay very little care to our old harbour  and town. They are rather exclusively attracted by our great  capital, Paris, and when coming to enjoy the splendid winters of  the French Riviera, they reach it direct by rail or by sea, and  seem to be quite ignorant of Marseilles, where they could find at  least what is our city's glory: LIGHT, LIFE and LABOUR.    I think that Marseilles deserves more attention, and that the old  ties between America and Marseilles should be better known. I would  recall that our history, especially the history of our Chamber of  Commerce, records the old sympathy of Marseilles for America. It is  as old as your nation herself. At the end of the eighteenth  century, when the stars of young America just appeared on the  Atlantic horizon, French warships fought for your fathers'  independence. Some ships of Admiral d'Estaing's French squadron  bore names such as \"LE MARSEILLAIS\", \"LA PROVENCE\". In the year  1782 the French fleet was increased by a new warship of 118 guns,  built and armed at the expense of the Chamber of Commerce of  Marseilles. Her cost was 1,200,000 francs, a very small sum of  money in our days, but rather a large one in those remote times.  She was offered to King Louis XVI for the very purpose of helping  in the American war, and she was named by the King \"Le Commerce de  Marseille.\"    Gentlemen, it is for the successors of the \"echevins\" of the year  1782 a great joy to meet in Marseilles the sons of the glorious  soldiers of the Independence War, sustained so many years ago with  the assistance of the warship bearing their own name.    Gentlemen, Marseilles may be somewhat ignored, but France was not  forgotten by America. I need not mention the numerous proofs our  country has received of your country's sympathy. But I only fulfill  a duty in emphasizing the very great help we have found in America  in the course of this terrible war, the greatest human cataclysm  which ever stormed the human world. All of us are aware that France  found in America another kind of help than material, steel and  grain. France found amongst you any sort of goods, but also--and  over all--kindness and pity. American ambulances, splendidly  organized, afforded invaluable relief to our wounded on the front.  May I mention not that American airmen rendered to our army the  most useful services, and that American lives were lost for France.  America helps us by sea, on land and in the air. Your country knows  that France is not fighting for power or profit, but that she is  pouring the best of her children's blood for Freedom and Humanity.    Gentlemen, we used to say in France that good accounts, that is good  settlements of business, make good friends. I believe that the words may  be reversed and that good friendship may lead to good business. I trust  that after this war, trade between America and Marseilles will be  largely extended. We have shown you that, notwithstanding the present  worries and difficulties, we are pushing on our harbor improvements and  preparing large accommodation for shipping and industry. We strongly  believe that, in the near future, Marseilles must become the most  important harbor and center of commerce for the whole Mediterranean Sea.  We think that the American trade will find in our city the best center  of distribution for your large exports of commodities such as petroleum,  harvesting machinery, tobacco, and that they should be forwarded through  Marseilles to all the Mediterranean shores. I have no doubt your visit  in our city will allow you to observe that you can find here produce of  our land or of our industry, most convenient for American requirements,  and that in the mutual interest of your and our cities the trade between  Marseilles and American ports will be proportionate to the friendship of  the Nations.    Mr. President, Gentlemen, I propose your good health and the good  health of your friends, and the prosperity of our sister Republic,  The United States of America.    * * *    [Illustration: Shore of Mediterranean near Marseilles. In the Distance  Chateau D'If, Made Famous by Dumas.]    There was greeting by M. Artaud, president of the Chamber of Commerce,  and a response by Mr. Nichols. We were given an ovation by the most  representative people of Marseilles. We met at this dinner, A. Gaulin,  American Consul General, and he was most cordial.    The next day was Sunday. In the afternoon we visited the Marseilles Art  Museum. We saw a bust, recently found, which dates back to the Second  century; it resembles very closely the work of Rodin. In this museum we  saw an old bell, labeled 1840, and an old straw hat, labeled 1820. We  drove all over the city, visited the old docks and noted the  cosmopolitan conglomeration of people in streets.    We were taken to the Chateau D'If, which is a quarter of a mile out at  sea, made world-famous by Dumas in the noted novel \"The Count of Monte  Cristo\". We all resolved, right then and there, that when we got home we  would re-read \"The Count of Monte Cristo\". In our drive we saw Longchamp  palace, which resembles very much the court of honor in the National  McKinley Birthplace Memorial at Niles, Ohio. The entrance to the port of  Marseilles resembles the Golden Gate at San Francisco. We gathered  considerable information in our talks with the people we met at  Marseilles, being told among other things, that all the officials of the  French government are to hold over until the war is over, that is to  say, elections are suspended for the time being. The efficiency and  preparedness of the Germans was enlarged upon, it being stated, as is  very well known, that Germany was the only country prepared at the time  the war broke out.    We visited at Marseilles the birthplace of Rouget de l'Isle, the author  of the Marseilles hymn. This hymn was first sung by a lady at an evening  party in Straussburgh, Germany, and it was then called the \"Hymn of the  Soldier from Marseilles\", but afterwards became known as \"The  Marsellaise Hymn\". It is the national anthem of France; the words are  inspiring and no one, whether American or French, can listen to the  music of this hymn without being stirred to the depths.    We heard much of the vast stores of zinc and iron ores in Tunisia and  Algeria, and were given much information about French colonies. France,  including its colonies, has nearly one hundred million people. The  Trans-Africa Railroad takes in a population of more than two hundred  million people along the Mediterranean, including France, Spain and  Italy. One of the largest dams in the world, \"La Durance Dame,\" 429 feet  across, is in France, not far from Marseilles.    Before the war Germany marketed a large amount of its coal in France,  three hundred thousand tons annually.    Bauxite or aluminum ore is mined in France, and 60 per cent. of the  output of the world is French product. Algeria contains millions of  acres of virgin forests, ready to be explored. The cork oak is one of  the important trees. Large exports of iron ore are made to England. At  the end of the war the French expect to market ore and coal from the  fields of Lorraine.    In our travels through Marseilles, we did not observe anywhere play  grounds or amusements of any kind for the workmen.    Marseilles has a number of convalescent hospitals. We saw in the streets  on Sunday, soldiers wandering about, English, French, Russian, Tunisian,  Algerian, Hindu-Chinese, Moroccan, Australian, Canadian, Corsican;  natives of Madagascar and Negroes from South Africa--soldiers from  eleven different nations.    There is a plan projected to connect Marseilles with a system of French  canals, so as to afford direct water communication between the  Mediterranean, the North Sea and thus to the English Channel. Marseilles  antedates the Christian era by five hundred years. In 1782 a man-of-war  mounting one hundred and eighteen guns, named \"La Commerce de  Marseilles\" was built at the expense of the Marseilles Chamber of  Commerce and presented to Louis XVI for the fleet sent by the French  Government to fight for American independence. Marseilles, later on,  became prominent in the French Revolution and gave its name to the  French national hymn.    The largest tunnel in the world is now well under course of  construction in France, its object being to give the city of Marseilles  connection with Paris and the interior in general by rail and water.  This tunnel will provide an ample waterway for barges. The entire  project involves the building of a new harbor and the cutting of a ship  canal, actually tunneled through solid rock for five long miles, joining  the old harbor and the Mediterranean to the River Rhone. The Rhone's  upper stretches are placid and already are used extensively for barge  navigation, but near Marseilles the stream is far too turbulent for  commerce. A range of hills had prevented the construction of a canal in  days gone by. Now, with France energized by the war, and with the  necessity for the canal emphasized thereby, the tunnel is being pushed  and the canal will soon be opened. It will connect Marseilles with the  network of canals which extends throughout the country. There are longer  tunnels in the world, but none so large, for this is seventy-two feet  wide and"]]]
