It seemed that the rocks might, with no great labour, have been hewn  almost into a regular flight of steps; and as there are no other landing  places, I considered this rugged ascent as the consequence of a form of  life inured to hardships, and therefore not studious of nice  accommodations.  But I know not whether, for many ages, it was not  considered as a part of military policy, to keep the country not easily  accessible.  The rocks are natural fortifications, and an enemy climbing  with difficulty, was easily destroyed by those who stood high above him.    Our reception exceeded our expectations.  We found nothing but civility,  elegance, and plenty.  After the usual refreshments, and the usual  conversation, the evening came upon us.  The carpet was then rolled off  the floor; the musician was called, and the whole company was invited to  dance, nor did ever fairies trip with greater alacrity.  The general air  of festivity, which predominated in this place, so far remote from all  those regions which the mind has been used to contemplate as the mansions  of pleasure, struck the imagination with a delightful surprise, analogous  to that which is felt at an unexpected emersion from darkness into light.    When it was time to sup, the dance ceased, and six and thirty persons sat  down to two tables in the same room.  After supper the ladies sung Erse  songs, to which I listened as an English audience to an Italian opera,  delighted with the sound of words which I did not understand.    I inquired the subjects of the songs, and was told of one, that it was a  love song, and of another, that it was a farewell composed by one of the  Islanders that was going, in this epidemical fury of emigration, to seek  his fortune in America.  What sentiments would arise, on such an  occasion, in the heart of one who had not been taught to lament by  precedent, I should gladly have known; but the lady, by whom I sat,  thought herself not equal to the work of translating.    Mr. Macleod is the proprietor of the islands of Raasay, Rona, and Fladda,  and possesses an extensive district in Sky.  The estate has not, during  four hundred years, gained or lost a single acre.  He acknowledges  Macleod of Dunvegan as his chief, though his ancestors have formerly  disputed the pre-eminence.    One of the old Highland alliances has continued for two hundred years,  and is still subsisting between Macleod of Raasay and Macdonald of Sky,  in consequence of which, the survivor always inherits the arms of the  deceased; a natural memorial of military friendship.  At the death of the  late Sir James Macdonald, his sword was delivered to the present laird of  Raasay.    The family of Raasay consists of the laird, the lady, three sons and ten  daughters.  For the sons there is a tutor in the house, and the lady is  said to be very skilful and diligent in the education of her girls.  More  gentleness of manners, or a more pleasing appearance of domestick  society, is not found in the most polished countries.    Raasay is the only inhabited island in Mr. Macleod's possession.  Rona  and Fladda afford only pasture for cattle, of which one hundred and sixty  winter in Rona, under the superintendence of a solitary herdsman.    The length of Raasay is, by computation, fifteen miles, and the breadth  two.  These countries have never been measured, and the computation by  miles is negligent and arbitrary.  We observed in travelling, that the  nominal and real distance of places had very little relation to each  other.  Raasay probably contains near a hundred square miles.  It affords  not much ground, notwithstanding its extent, either for tillage, or  pasture; for it is rough, rocky, and barren.  The cattle often perish by  falling from the precipices.  It is like the other islands, I think,  generally naked of shade, but it is naked by neglect; for the laird has  an orchard, and very large forest trees grow about his house.  Like other  hilly countries it has many rivulets.  One of the brooks turns a corn-  mill, and at least one produces trouts.    In the streams or fresh lakes of the Islands, I have never heard of any  other fish than trouts and eels.  The trouts, which I have seen, are not  large; the colour of their flesh is tinged as in England.  Of their eels  I can give no account, having never tasted them; for I believe they are  not considered as wholesome food.    It is not very easy to fix the principles upon which mankind have agreed  to eat some animals, and reject others; and as the principle is not  evident, it is not uniform.  That which is selected as delicate in one  country, is by its neighbours abhorred as loathsome.  The Neapolitans  lately refused to eat potatoes in a famine.  An Englishman is not easily  persuaded to dine on snails with an Italian, on frogs with a Frenchman,  or on horseflesh with a Tartar.  The vulgar inhabitants of Sky, I know  not whether of the other islands, have not only eels, but pork and bacon  in abhorrence, and accordingly I never saw a hog in the Hebrides, except  one at Dunvegan.    Raasay has wild fowl in abundance, but neither deer, hares, nor rabbits.  Why it has them not, might be asked, but that of such questions there is  no end.  Why does any nation want what it might have?  Why are not spices  transplanted to America?  Why does tea continue to be brought from China?  Life improves but by slow degrees, and much in every place is yet to do.  Attempts have been made to raise roebucks in Raasay, but without effect.  The young ones it is extremely difficult to rear, and the old can very  seldom be taken alive.    Hares and rabbits might be more easily obtained.  That they have few or  none of either in Sky, they impute to the ravage of the foxes, and have  therefore set, for some years past, a price upon their heads, which, as  the number was diminished, has been gradually raised, from three  shillings and sixpence to a guinea, a sum so great in this part of the  world, that, in a short time, Sky may be as free from foxes, as England  from wolves.  The fund for these rewards is a tax of sixpence in the  pound, imposed by the farmers on themselves, and said to be paid with  great willingness.    The beasts of prey in the Islands are foxes, otters, and weasels.  The  foxes are bigger than those of England; but the otters exceed ours in a  far greater proportion.  I saw one at Armidel, of a size much beyond that  which I supposed them ever to attain; and Mr. Maclean, the heir of Col, a  man of middle stature, informed me that he once shot an otter, of which  the tail reached the ground, when he held up the head to a level with his  own.  I expected the otter to have a foot particularly formed for the art  of swimming; but upon examination, I did not find it differing much from  that of a spaniel.  As he preys in the sea, he does little visible  mischief, and is killed only for his fur.  White otters are sometimes  seen.    In Raasay they might have hares and rabbits, for they have no foxes.  Some  depredations, such as were never made before, have caused a suspicion  that a fox has been lately landed in the Island by spite or wantonness.  This imaginary stranger has never yet been seen, and therefore, perhaps,  the mischief was done by some other animal.  It is not likely that a  creature so ungentle, whose head could have been sold in Sky for a  guinea, should be kept alive only to gratify the malice of sending him to  prey upon a neighbour: and the passage from Sky is wider than a fox would  venture to swim, unless he were chased by dogs into the sea, and perhaps  than his strength would enable him to cross.  How beasts of prey came  into any islands is not easy to guess.  In cold countries they take  advantage of hard winters, and travel over the ice: but this is a very  scanty solution; for they are found where they have no discoverable means  of coming.    The corn of this island is but little.  I saw the harvest of a small  field.  The women reaped the Corn, and the men bound up the sheaves.  The  strokes of the sickle were timed by the modulation of the harvest song,  in which all their voices were united.  They accompany in the Highlands  every action, which can be done in equal time, with an appropriated  strain, which has, they say, not much meaning; but its effects are  regularity and cheerfulness.  The ancient proceleusmatick song, by which  the rowers of gallies were animated, may be supposed to have been of this  kind.  There is now an oar-song used by the Hebridians.    The ground of Raasay seems fitter for cattle than for corn, and of black  cattle I suppose the number is very great.  The Laird himself keeps a  herd of four hundred, one hundred of which are annually sold.  Of an  extensive domain, which he holds in his own hands, he considers the sale  of cattle as repaying him the rent, and supports the plenty of a very  liberal table with the remaining product.    Raasay is supposed to have been very long inhabited.  On one side of it  they show caves, into which the rude nations of the first ages retreated  from the weather.  These dreary vaults might have had other uses.  There  is still a cavity near the house called the oar-cave, in which the  seamen, after one of those piratical expeditions, which in rougher times  were very frequent, used, as tradition tells, to hide their oars.  This  hollow was near the sea, that nothing so necessary might be far to be  fetched; and it was secret, that enemies, if they landed, could find  nothing.  Yet it is not very evident of what use it was to hide their  oars from those, who, if they were masters of the coast, could take away  their boats.    A proof much stronger of the distance at which the first possessors of  this island lived from the present time, is afforded by the stone heads  of arrows which are very frequently picked up.

That  indefatigable spirit, Master Simon, in the faithful discharge of his  duties as lord of misrule, had conceived the idea of a Christmas  mummery, or masquing; and having called in to his assistance the Oxonian  and the young officer, who were equally ripe for anything that should  occasion romping and merriment, they had carried it into instant effect.  The old housekeeper had been consulted; the antique clothes-presses and  wardrobes rummaged and made to yield up the relics of finery that had  not seen the light for several generations; the younger part of the  company had been privately convened from the parlour and hall, and the  whole had been bedizened out, into a burlesque imitation of an antique  masque.[O]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Master Simon led the van, as \"Ancient Christmas,\" quaintly apparelled in  a ruff, a short cloak, which had very much the aspect of one of the old  housekeeper's petticoats, and a hat that might have served for a village  steeple, and must indubitably have figured in the days of the  Covenanters. From under this his nose curved boldly forth, flushed with  a frost-bitten bloom, that seemed the very trophy of a December blast.  He was accompanied by the blue-eyed romp, dished up as \"Dame Mince-Pie,\"  in the venerable magnificence of faded brocade, long stomacher, peaked  hat, and high-heeled shoes. The young officer appeared as Robin Hood, in  a sporting dress of Kendal green, and a foraging cap, with a gold  tassel. The costume, to be sure, did not bear testimony to deep  research, and there was an evident eye to the picturesque, natural to a  young gallant in the presence of his mistress. The fair Julia hung on  his arm in a pretty rustic dress, as \"Maid Marian.\" The rest of the  train had been metamorphosed in various ways; the girls trussed up in  the finery of the ancient belles of the Bracebridge line, and the  striplings be-whiskered with burnt cork, and gravely clad in broad  skirts, hanging sleeves, and full-bottomed wigs, to represent the  characters of Roast Beef, Plum Pudding, and other worthies celebrated  in ancient maskings. The whole was under the control of the Oxonian, in  the appropriate character of Misrule; and I observed that he exercised  rather a mischievous sway with his wand over the smaller personages of  the pageant. [Illustration]    [Illustration: \"The rest of the train had been metamorphosed in various  ways.\"--PAGE 153.]    [Illustration]    The irruption of this motley crew, with beat of drum, according to  ancient custom, was the consummation of uproar and merriment. Master  Simon covered himself with glory by the stateliness with which, as  Ancient Christmas, he walked a minuet with the peerless, though  giggling, Dame Mince-Pie. It was followed by a dance of all the  characters, which, from its medley of costumes, seemed as though the old  family portraits had skipped down from their frames to join in the  sport. Different centuries were figuring at cross hands and right and  left; the dark ages were cutting pirouettes and rigadoons; and the days  of Queen Bess jigging merrily down the middle, through a line of  succeeding generations.    [Illustration]    The worthy Squire contemplated these fantastic sports, and this  resurrection of his old wardrobe, with the simple relish of childish  delight. He stood chuckling and rubbing his hands, and scarcely hearing  a word the parson said, notwithstanding that the latter was discoursing  most authentically on the ancient and stately dance at the Paon, or  Peacock, from which he conceived the minuet to be derived.[P] For my  part, I was in a continual excitement, from the varied scenes of whim  and innocent gaiety passing before me. It was inspiring to see wild-eyed  frolic and warmhearted hospitality breaking out from among the chills  and glooms of winter, and old age throwing off his apathy, and catching  once more the freshness of youthful enjoyment. I felt also an interest  in the scene, from the consideration that these fleeting customs were  posting fast into oblivion, and that this was, perhaps, the only family  in England in which the whole of them were still punctiliously observed.  There was a quaintness, too, mingled with all this revelry, that gave it  a peculiar zest; it was suited to the time and place; and as the old  Manor House almost reeled with mirth and wassail, it seemed echoing back  the joviality of long-departed years.    [Illustration]    But enough of Christmas and its gambols; it is time for me to pause in  this garrulity. Methinks I hear the questions asked by my graver  readers, \"To what purpose is all this?--how is the world to be made  wiser by this talk?\" Alas! is there not wisdom enough extant for the  instruction of the world? And if not, are there not thousands of abler  pens labouring for its improvement?--It is so much pleasanter to please  than to instruct--to play the companion rather than the preceptor.    What, after all, is the mite of wisdom that I could throw into the mass  of knowledge? or how am I sure that my sagest deductions may be safe  guides for the opinions of others? But in writing to amuse, if I fail,  the only evil is my own disappointment. If, however, I can by any lucky  chance, in these days of evil, rub out one wrinkle from the brow of  care, or beguile the heavy heart of one moment of sorrow; if I can now  and then penetrate through the gathering film of misanthropy, prompt a  benevolent view of human nature, and make my reader more in good humour  with his fellow-beings and himself, surely, surely, I shall not then  have written entirely in vain.

The mistletoe is still hung up in farm-houses and kitchens at Christmas;  and the young men have the privilege of kissing the girls under it,  plucking each time a berry from the bush. When the berries are all  plucked, the privilege ceases.      NOTE B, p. 58.    The _Yule-clog_ is a great log of wood, sometimes the root of a tree,  brought into the house with great ceremony, on Christmas eve, laid in  the fireplace, and lighted with the brand of last year's clog. While it  lasted there was great drinking, singing, and telling of tales.  Sometimes it was accompanied by Christmas candles, but in the cottages  the only light was from the ruddy blaze of the great wood fire. The  _Yule-clog_ was to burn all night; if it went out, it was considered a  sign of ill luck.    Herrick mentions it in one of his songs:--                \"Come, bring with a noise               My merrie, merrie boyes,            The Christmas log to the firing:               While my good dame, she               Bids ye all be free,            And drink to your hearts' desiring.\"    The _Yule-clog_ is still burnt in many farm-houses and kitchens in  England, particularly in the north, and there are several superstitions  connected with it among the peasantry. If a squinting person come to the  house while it is burning, or a person barefooted, it is considered an  ill omen. The brand remaining from the _Yule-clog_ is carefully put away  to light the next year's Christmas fire.      NOTE C, p. 102.    From the \"Flying Eagle,\" a small Gazette, published December 24,  1652:--\"The House spent much time this day about the business of the  Navy, for settling the affairs at sea; and before they rose, were  presented with a terrible remonstrance against Christmas day, grounded  upon divine Scriptures, 2 Cor. v. 16; 1 Cor. xv. 14, 17; and in honour  of the Lord's Day, grounded upon these Scriptures, John xx. 1; Rev. i.  10; Psalm cxviii. 24; Lev. xxiii. 7, 11; Mark xvi. 8; Psalm lxxxiv. 10,  in which Christmas is called Anti-Christ's masse, and those Mass-mongers  and Papists who observe it, etc. In consequence of which Parliament  spent some time in consultation about the abolition of Christmas day,  passed orders to that effect, and resolved to sit on the following day,  which was commonly called Christmas day.\"      NOTE D p. 108.    \"An English gentleman at the opening of the great day, _i.e._ on  Christmas day in the morning, had all his tenants and neighbours enter  his hall by daybreak. The strong beer was broached, and the black jacks  went plentifully about with toast, sugar, nutmeg, and good Cheshire  cheese. The hackin (the great sausage) must be boiled by daybreak, or  else two young men must take the maiden (_i.e._ the cook) by the arms  and run her round the marketplace till she is shamed of her  laziness.\"--_Round about our Sea-Coal Fire._      NOTE E, p. 129.    The old ceremony of serving up the boar's head on Christmas day is still  observed in the hall of Queen's College, Oxford. I was favoured by the  parson with a copy of the carol as now sung, and as it may be acceptable  to such of my readers as are curious in these grave and learned matters,  I give it entire.              \"The boar's head in hand bear I,             Bedeck'd with bays and rosemary;             And I pray you, my masters, be merry,               Quot estis in convivio.
