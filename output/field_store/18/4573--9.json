This fantasy can hardly be taken seriously as a  scientific theory; it seems, however, to have been what guided Goethe  in his \"discovery\" of the vertebral nature of the skull. Just as the  fore limb can be homologised with the hind limb, so, reasoning by  analogy, the skull should be capable of being homologised with the  vertebrae. To what ludicrous extremes this doctrine of the repetition  of parts within the organism was pushed we shall see when we consider  the theories of the German transcendentalists of the early nineteenth  century.    Though Goethe's morphological views were lacking in definiteness he  hit upon one or two ideas which proved useful. Thus he enunciated the  \"law of balance\" long before Etienne Geoffroy St Hilaire, the law  \"that to no part can anything be added, without something being taken  away from another part, and _vice versa_.\"[81] He saw, too, what a help  to the interpretation of adult structure the study of the embryo would  be, for many bones which are fused in the adult are separate in the  embryo.[82] This also was a point to which the later transcendentalists  gave considerable attention.    So far we have spoken of Goethe as if he were merely the prophet of  formal morphology; we have pointed out how he brought to clear  expression the morphological principle implicit in the idea of unity  of type, and how he seized upon some important guiding ideas, such as  the principle of connections. But Goethe was not a formalist, and he  was very far from the static conception of life which is at the base  of pure morphology. His interest was not in _Gestalt_ or fixed form,  _Bildung_ or form change. He saw that _Gestalt_ was but a momentary  phase of _Bildung_, and could be considered apart and in itself only  by an abstraction fatal to all understanding of the living thing.  Mephistopheles scoffs at the scholars who would explain a living  creature by anatomising it:     \"Dann hat er die Theile in seiner Hand,    Fehlt leider! nur das geistige Band.\"[83]    Goethe kept clear of this mistake; he knew that the artist comes  nearer to the truth than the analyst.    In the fragment entitled _Bildung und Umbildung organischer Naturen_  (1807), introductory to a reprint of his paper on the \"Metamorphosis  of Plants,\" we get an exposition of his general views on living  things. He points out there how we try to understand things by  separating them into their parts. We can, it is true, resolve the  organism into its structural elements, but we cannot recompose it or  endow it with life by joining up the parts. Hence we require some  other means of understanding it. \"In all ages even among scientific  men there can be discerned a yearning to apprehend the living form as  such, to grasp the connection of their external visible parts, to  interpret them as indications of the inner activity, and so, in a  certain measure, to master the whole conceptually.\" This science which  should discover the inner meaning of organic _Bildung_ is called  Morphology.[84] In Morphology we should not speak of _Gestalt_ or fixed  form, or if we do we should understand by it only a momentary phase of  _Bildung_. Form is of interest not in itself but only as the  manifestation of the inner activity of the living being. Over  development, he says elsewhere, there presides a formative force, a  _bildende Kraft_ or _Bildungstrieb_, which works out the idea of the  organism. Living things, in his view of them, strive to manifest an  idea. They are Nature's works of art--and so, incidentally, they  require an artist to interpret them.    This profound conception of the nature of life is applied not only to  the growing changing individual but also to the whole changing world  of organisms. They are all manifestations of a living shaping power  which moulds them. This shaping power, immanent in all life, is  conceived to work according to a general plan, and so we get an  explanation of the fact that living things seem simply varieties of  one common type.    \"If we once recognise,\" says Goethe, \"that the creative spirit brings  into being and shapes the evolution of the more perfect organic  creatures according to a general scheme, is it altogether impossible  to represent this original plan if not to the senses at least to the  mind...?\"[85]    Such an interpretation of the unity of plan reaches perhaps beyond the  bounds of science.

[84] Goethe was the inventor of the word.        [85] Cotta ed., ix., p. 490.          CHAPTER V    ETIENNE GEOFFROY SAINT-HILAIRE      E. Geoffrey made an experiment, unsuccessful but instructive. He tried  to found a science of pure morphology; he failed: his failure showed,  once and for all, that a pure morphology of organic forms is  impracticable.    Already, in 1796, in one of his earliest memoirs,[86] Geoffroy was  guided by the idea that Nature has formed all living things upon one  plan. Organs which seem anomalous are merely modifications of the  normal; the trunk of an elephant is formed by the excessively  prolonged nostrils, the horn of a rhinoceros is simply a mass of  adhering hairs. In general, however varied their form, all organs are  simply variations of a common scheme; Nature employs no new organs.  Organs which are rudimentary, such as the clavicles in the ostrich and  the nictitating membrane in man, bear witness to the unity of plan. In  this Geoffroy goes no further than his predecessors. They too had  recognised homologies of organs; they too had interpreted rudimentary  organs as vestiges of an original plan.    In a series of papers published in 1807, Geoffroy took a further step,  and sought to establish homologies which were not obvious--homologies,  too, not so much of organs as of parts.    These memoirs (published in the _Annales du Museum d'Histoire  naturelle_, vols. ix. and x., 1807) dealt with the homology between  the bones of the pectoral fin and girdle in fish and the bones of the  arm and shoulder-girdle in higher Vertebrates, with the homologies of  the bones of the sternum, and with the determination of the pieces of  the skull, particularly in the crocodile. All Geoffroy's morphological  doctrine is found in them, but for the full expression of his views we  must take his chief work, the _Philosophie anatomique_, particularly  the first volume (1818). This volume contains, beside the important  \"Discours preliminaire\" and \"Introduction\" which we shall presently  consider in detail, five memoirs, which deal with the various bones  connected with the respiratory organs in fishes (the bones of the  operculum, of the hyoid, of the branchial arches, of the pectoral  girdle), and seek to discover their homologies with corresponding  bones in air-breathing Vertebrates.    \"Can the organisation of vertebrated animals be referred to one  uniform type?\" This is the question with which the _Philosophie  anatomique_ opens, the question to which the whole book is an answer.  But is it not generally acknowledged by naturalists that Vertebrates  are built upon one uniform plan, that, for instance, the fore limb may  be modified for running, climbing, swimming, or flying, yet the  arrangement of the bones remain the same? How else could there be a  \"natural method\" of classification?[87]    But the homologies so drawn repose upon a vague and confused feeling for  likenesses; they are not based upon an explicit principle. What general  principle can be applied? \"Now it is evident that the sole general  principle one can apply is given by the position, the relations, and the  dependencies of the parts, that is to say, by what I name and include  under the term of _connections_.\" For instance, the part known as the  hand in man and generally as the fore foot in other Vertebrates, is the  fourth part in order in the anterior member, and its homologue can  always be recognised by this fact of its connections (p. xxvi.). The  principle of connections serves as a guide in tracing an organ through  all its functional transformations, for \"an organ can be deteriorated,  atrophied, annihilated, but not transposed\" (p. xxx.).    It is this principle which enables one to follow out in detail the  further fundamental conception that in every Vertebrate there are found  the same \"organic materials,\" or units of construction. This conception,  which Geoffroy calls the _Theorie des analogues_ (p. xxxii.), is clearly  one part of the old idea of the unity of type; it teaches the _unity of  composition_ of organic beings, while the _Principe des connexions_ adds  the _unity of plan_.    Both conceptions are logically implicit in the vague notion of unity of  type; Geoffroy disengaged them, and pushed each to its logical extreme.    Most of the ordinary homologies of structure in air-breathing  Vertebrates have already been seized, he continues, for they are more or  less obvious, and many intermediate states exist (p. xxxiv.). But  ordinary methods of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20439"],[0,"Susan B. Anthony (#12)"],[1," Susan's great  hero, William Lloyd Garrison, sat at Lucretia's right at the long  table in the dining room, Susan on her left, and at the end of each  meal, when the little cedar tub filled with hot soapy water was  brought in and set before Lucretia so that she could wash the silver,  glass, and fine china at the table, Susan dried them on a snowy-white  towel while the interesting conversation continued. There was talk of  woman's rights, of temperance, and of spiritualism, which was  attracting many new converts. There were thrilling stories of the  opening of the West and the building of transcontinental railways; but  most often and most earnestly the discussion turned to the progress of  the antislavery movement, to the infamous Kansas-Nebraska bill, to the  New England Emigrant Aid Company,[53] which was sending free-state  settlers to Kansas, to the weakness of the government in playing again  and again into the hands of the proslavery faction. Most of them saw  the country headed toward a vast slave empire which would embrace  Cuba, Mexico, and finally Brazil; and William Lloyd Garrison fervently  reiterated his doctrine, \"No Union with Slaveholders.\"    Before leaving home Susan had heard first-hand reports of the bitter  bloody antislavery contest in Kansas from her brother Daniel, who had  just returned from a trip to that frontier territory with settlers  sent out by the New England Emigrant Aid Company. Now talking with  William Lloyd Garrison, she found herself torn between these two great  causes for human freedom, abolition and woman's rights, and it was  hard for her to decide which cause needed her more.           *       *       *       *       *    She had not, however, forgotten her unfinished business in New York  State. The refusal of the legislature to amend the property laws had  doubled her determination to continue circulating petitions until  married women's civil rights were finally recognized. It took courage  to go alone to towns where she was unknown to arrange for meetings on  the unpopular subject of woman's rights. Not knowing how she would be  received, she found it almost as difficult to return to such towns as  Canajoharie where she had been highly respected as a teacher six years  before. In Canajoharie, however, she was greeted affectionately by her  uncle Joshua Read. He and his friends let her use the Methodist church  for her lecture, and when the trustees of the academy urged her to  return there to teach, Uncle Joshua interrupted with a vehement \"No!\"  protesting that others could teach but it was Susan's work \"to go  around and set people thinking about the laws.\"[54]    Returning to the scene of her girlhood in Battenville and Easton,  visiting her sisters Guelma and Hannah, and meeting many of her old  friends, Susan realized as never before how completely she had  outgrown her old environment. In her enthusiasm for her new work, she  exposed \"many of her heresies,\" and when her friends labeled William  Lloyd Garrison an agnostic and rabble rouser, she protested that he  was the most Christlike man she had ever known. \"Thus it is belief,  not Christian benevolence,\" she confided to her diary in 1854, \"that  is made the modern test of Christianity.\"[55]    After eight strenuous months away from home, she was welcomed warmly  by a family who believed in her work. She found abolition uppermost in  everyone's mind. Her brother Merritt, fired by Daniel's tales of the  West and the antislavery struggle in Kansas, was impatient to join the  settlers there and could talk of nothing else. While he poured out the  latest news about Kansas, he and a cousin Mary Luther helped Susan  fold handbills for future woman's rights meetings. Susan listened  eagerly and approvingly as he told of the 750 free-state settlers who  during the past summer had gone out to Kansas, traveling up the  Missouri on steamboats and over lonely trails in wagons marked  \"Kansas.\" Most of them were not abolitionists but men who wanted  Kansas a free-labor state which they could develop with their own hard  work. She heard of the ruthless treatment these \"Yankee\" settlers  faced from the proslavery Missourians who wanted Kansas in the slavery  bloc. There was bloodshed and there would be more. John Brown's sons  had written from Kansas, \"Send us guns. We need them more than  bread.\"[56] Merritt was ready and eager to join John Brown.    The Anthony farm was virtually a hotbed of insurrection with Merritt  planning resistance in Kansas and Susan reform in New York. Susan  mapped out an ambitious itinerary, hoping to canvass with her  petitions every county in the state. With her father as security, she  borrowed money to print her handbills and notices, and then wrote  Wendell Phillips asking if any money for a woman's rights campaign had  been raised by the last national convention. He replied with his own  personal check for fifty dollars. His generosity and confidence  touched her deeply, for already he had become a hero to her second  only to William Lloyd Garrison. This tall handsome intellectual, a  graduate of Harvard and an unsurpassed orator, had forfeited friends,  social position, and a promising career as a lawyer to plead for the  slave. He was also one of the very few men who sympathized with and  aided the woman's rights cause.    Horace Greeley too proved at this time to be a good friend, writing,  \"I have your letter and your programme, friend Susan. I will publish  the latter in all our editions, but return your dollars.\"[57]    Her earnestness and ability made a great appeal to these men. They  marveled at her industry. Thirty-four years old now, not handsome but  wholesome, simply and neatly dressed, her brown hair smoothly parted  and brought down over her ears, she had nothing of the scatterbrained  impulsive reformer about her, and no coquetry. She was practical and  intelligent, and men liked to discuss their work with her. William  Henry Channing, admiring her executive ability and her plucky reaction  to defeat, dubbed her the Napoleon of the woman's rights movement.  Parker Pillsbury, the fiery abolitionist from New Hampshire,  broad-shouldered, dark-bearded, with blazing eyes and almost fanatical  zeal, had become her devoted friend. He liked nothing better than to  tease her about her idleness and pretend to be in search of more work  for her to do.           *       *       *       *       *    So impatient was Susan to begin her New York State campaign that she  left home on Christmas Day to hold her first meeting on December 26,  1854, at Mayville in Chatauqua County. The weather was cold and damp,  but the four pounds of candles which she had bought to light the court  house flickered cheerily while the small curious audience, gathered  from several nearby towns, listened to the first woman most of them  had ever heard speak in public. She would be, they reckoned, worth  hearing at least once.    Traveling from town to town, she held meetings every other night.  Usually the postmasters or sheriffs posted her notices in the town  square and gave them to the newspapers and to the ministers to  announce in their churches. Even in a hostile community she almost  always found a gallant fair-minded man to come to her aid, such as the  hotel proprietor who offered his dining room for her meetings when  the court house, schoolhouse, and churches were closed to her, or the  group of men who, when the ministers refused to announce her meetings,  struck off handbills which they distributed at the church doors at the  close of the services. The newspapers too were generally friendly.    As men were the voters with power to change the laws, she aimed to  attract them to her evening meetings, and usually they came, seeking  diversion, and listened respectfully. Some of them scoffed, others  condemned her for undermining the home, but many found her reasoning  logical and by their questions put life into the meetings. A few even  encouraged their wives to enlist in the cause.    The women, on the other hand, were timid or indifferent, although she  pointed out to them the way to win the legal right to their earnings  and their children. It was difficult to find among them a rebellious  spirit brave enough to head a woman's rights society.    \"Susan B. Anthony is in town,\" wrote young Caroline Cowles, a  Canandaigua school girl, in her diary at this time. \"She made a  special request that all seminary girls should come to hear her as  well as all the women and girls in town. She had a large audience and  she talked very plainly about our rights and how we ought to stand up  for them and said the world would never go right until the women had  just as much right to vote and rule as the men.... When I told  Grandmother about it, she said she guessed Susan B. Anthony had  forgotten that St. Paul said women should keep silence. I told her,  no, she didn't, for she spoke particularly about St. Paul and said if  he had lived in these times ... he would have been as anxious to have  women at the head of the government as she was. I could not make  Grandmother agree with her at all.\"[58]    Many of the towns Susan visited were not on a railroad. Often after a  long cold sleigh ride she slept in a hotel room without a fire; in the  morning she might have to break the ice in the pitcher to take the  cold sponge bath which nothing could induce her to omit since she had  begun to follow the water cure, a new therapeutic method then in  vogue.    For a time Ernestine Rose came to her aid and it was a relief to turn  over the meetings to such an accomplished speaker. But for the most  part Susan braved it alone. Steadily adding names to her petitions  and leaving behind the leaflets which Elizabeth Stanton had written,  she aroused a glimmer of interest in a new valuation of women.
