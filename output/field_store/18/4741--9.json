My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle  tingled as I thought of it.    \"The man was seen,\" continued Lestrade. \"A milk boy, passing on his way  to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews  at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay  there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which  was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the  ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to  be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular  notice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him  to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish  face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in  the room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained  water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the  sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.\"    I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which  tallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of  exultation or satisfaction upon his face.    \"Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the  murderer?\" he asked.    \"Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber's purse in his pocket, but it seems  that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd  pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these  extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were  no papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket, except a single  telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing  the words, 'J. H. is in Europe.' There was no name appended to this  message.\"    \"And there was nothing else?\" Holmes asked.    \"Nothing of any importance. The man's novel, with which he had read  himself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair  beside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the  window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.\"    Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.    \"The last link,\" he cried, exultantly. \"My case is complete.\"    The two detectives stared at him in amazement.    \"I have now in my hands,\" my companion said, confidently, \"all the  threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details  to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the  time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the  discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own  eyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand  upon those pills?\"    \"I have them,\" said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \"I took them  and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of  safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these  pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to  them.\"    \"Give them here,\" said Holmes. \"Now, Doctor,\" turning to me, \"are those  ordinary pills?\"    They certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,  round, and almost transparent against the light. \"From their lightness  and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,\" I  remarked.    \"Precisely so,\" answered Holmes. \"Now would you mind going down and  fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long,  and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.\"    I went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It's laboured  breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.  Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded  the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the  rug.    \"I will now cut one of these pills in two,\" said Holmes, and drawing his  penknife he suited the action to the word. \"One half we return into the  box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass,  in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the  Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\"    \"This may be very interesting,\" said Lestrade, in the injured tone of  one who suspects that he is being laughed at, \"I cannot see, however,  what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\"    \"Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has  everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the  mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps  it up readily enough.\"    As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and  placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock  Holmes' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in  silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling  effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched  upon tho [16] cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently  neither the better nor the worse for its draught.    Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without  result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared  upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the  table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great  was his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two  detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which  he had met.    \"It can't be a coincidence,\" he cried, at last springing from his chair  and pacing wildly up and down the room; \"it is impossible that it should  be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of  Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they  are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot  have been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the  worse. Ah, I have it! I have it!\" With a perfect shriek of delight he  rushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk,  and presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature's tongue  seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive  shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been  struck by lightning.    Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his  forehead. \"I should have more faith,\" he said; \"I ought to know by  this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of  deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other  interpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly  poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that  before ever I saw the box at all.\"    This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could  hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,  however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me  that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began  to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.    \"All this seems strange to you,\" continued Holmes, \"because you failed  at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single  real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize  upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to  confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence  of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more  obscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.  It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most  commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no  new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder  would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of  the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of  those _outre_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered  it remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more  difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.\"    Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable  impatience, could contain himself no longer. \"Look here, Mr. Sherlock  Holmes,\" he said, \"we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart  man, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something  more than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking  the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young  Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade  went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too.  You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more  than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to  ask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the  man who did it?\"    \"I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\" remarked Lestrade.  \"We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more  than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence  which you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.\"    \"Any delay in arresting the assassin,\" I observed, \"might give him time  to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.\"    Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He  continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest  and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.    \"There will be no more murders,\" he said at last, stopping abruptly and  facing us. \"You can put that consideration out of the question. You have  asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of  his name is a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24407"],[0,"The Italian Cook Book (#12)"],[1,"little salt and  pepper on account of the sausages that already contain them. Remove them  and in the gravy that remains put a crumb of bread, in order to obtain  with a little broth two tablespoonfuls of thick pap. Skin the sausages,  chop the chicken giblets and the giblets and grind everything together  with the chestnuts, the egg and the pap; this is the stuffing with which  the fowl is to be filled, to be baked afterward. It is more tasty cold  than hot, and it can also be cut better.      140    CHICKEN WITH SAUCE PIQUANTE    (Pollo al diavolo)    This ought to be cooked with Cayenne pepper and served with a highly  seasoned sauce, but not everybody likes that and a simpler way to cook  the chicken \"al diavolo\" is the following:    Take a young chicken, remove the neck and the legs, open it all in front  and flatten it open as much as possible. Wash and wipe dry with a towel,  then put it on the grill and when it begins to brown turn it. Grease it  with melted butter or with oil, using a brush, and season with salt and  pepper. The later may be Cayenne pepper for those who like it. Keep  turning and greasing until it is all cooked.    To prepare the sauce piquante that many like with chicken broiled in  this way, put four tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan and when it  begins to brown add two tablespoonfuls of flour and stir until it is  well browned, but do not let it burn. Draw to a cooler place on the  range and slowly add two cupfuls of brown stock, stirring constantly,  add salt and a dash of Cayenne and let simmer for ten minutes. In  another saucepan boil four tablespoonfuls of vinegar one tablespoonful  of chopped onion, one teaspoonful of sugar rapidly for five minutes;  then add it to the sauce and at the same time add one tablespoonful of  chopped capers two tablespoonfuls of chopped pickle and one teaspoonful  of tarragon vinegar. Stir well and let cook for two minutes to heat the  pickles. If the sauce becomes too thick dilute it with a little water.    This sauce is excellent for baked fish and all roasts and boiled meats,  besides being a fitting condiment for the chicken \"al diavolo\".      141    CHICKEN WITH HAM    (Pollo in porchetta)    Fill a chicken with thin strips of ham, about half an inch wide. Add  three cloves (or sections) of garlic, two little bunches of fennel and a  few grains of pepper. Season outside with salt and pepper and cook in a  saucepan with butter, or preferably bake in the oven. Sausages cut  lengthwise and previously skinned can be substituted for the ham.      142    CHICKEN SAUTE    (Pollo saltato)    Take a young chicken, remove the neck and trim the wings. Cut away the  legs. Cut the chicken into six pieces. Remove some of the bones. Beat  an egg with a teaspoonful of water and place in it the pieces of chicken  after dipping them in flour and seasoning generously with salt and  pepper. Leave the pieces in the egg until it is time for cooking. Then  take the pieces one by one, sprinkle with bread crumbs and place a  saucepan with a good piece of butter on the fire. When the butter begins  to brown put in the pieces of chicken from the side of the skin, then  turn them when browned to the other side. Let them on a good fire for  about ten minutes. Serve with lemon. The chicken prepared in this way is  good also when cold.      143    AFRICAN HEN    (Gallina di Faraone)    This fowl, that resembles the partridge, should not be too fresh, like  all game.    The best way to cook the African hen is roasted at the spit. Put in the  inside a ball of butter dipped in salt and wrap it in a piece of paper  greased with butter and sprinkled with salt. This paper must be removed  when the fowl is nearly cooked, and then the cooking is completed  greasing with more butter and adding more salt.      144    TAME DUCK ROASTED    (Anatra domestica arrosto)    Salt it inside and bandage all the breast with slices of bacon, large  and thin. Grease with oil and salt moderately when the cooking is almost  complete. If you have a wild duck grease with butter, as the meat is  drier.      145    TURKEY    (Tacchino)    The turkey has been imported to Europe from America, but it is  nevertheless a well known dish in Italian families, although not  enjoying the popularity that it has on this side of the ocean. When  roasted it is generally larded moderately with little pieces of garlic  and bay-leaf or rosemary and seasoned with a hash of corned beef or  bacon, a little butter, salt and pepper, tomato sauce or tomato paste  diluted in water. The breast, flattened until it is about half an inch  thick and seasoned generously some hours before cooking with oil, salt  and pepper, is excellent broiled on the grill.      146    LOIN OF PORK ROASTED    (Lombo di maiale arrosto)    The loin of pork, cut in little pieces forms an excellent roast at the  spit. The pieces of pork are to be divided by little pieces of toast and  greased with oil.    If the pork is to be baked, choose that piece of the loin that has its  ribs and that may weigh six or eight pounds. Lard it with garlic,  rosemary or bay leaf and a few cloves, but moderately, and season with  salt and pepper.    This roast is very popular in Italy, where they call it =arista=.      147    LEG OF LAMB    (Agnello all'Orientale)    This is a way to cook lamb in use in the Orient and adopted by the  Italians, especially in Southern Italy. The leg of lamb is to be larded  with the larding pin with slices of bacon seasoned with salt and pepper,  greased with butter or milk, or milk alone and salted when half cooked.    The Arabs, who are very fond of this dish, do not lard it, as pork is  forbidden by their religion, but cook it with an abundance of milk.      148    BROILED PIGEON    (Piccione in gratella)    Take a young, but fat pigeon, divide it in two parts lengthwise and  flatten it well with the hands. Then put it to brown in oil for four or  five minutes, just to harden the meat. Season when still hot with salt  and pepper, then arrange it as follows.    Melt in the fire, without boiling it, a piece of butter and mix the  liquid butter with one beaten egg. Dip the pigeon in the butter and egg  and keep it until it absorbs them. Then sprinkle with bread crumbs  ground fine. Cook on a grill on a low fire and serve with a sauce or a  side dish.      149    STEAK IN THE SAUCEPAN    (Bistecca nel tegame)    If you have a steak that does not appear to be too tender, put it in a  saucepan with a little piece of butter and some good olive oil, with a  taste of garlic and bay-leaf or rosemary. Add, if necessary, a little  broth or water or tomato sauce and serve with potatoes cooked in the  gravy that can be made more abundant with more broth, butter and tomato  sauce.      150    VEAL KIDNEY WITH ANCHOVY    (Rognone alle acciughe)    Take a veal kidney, remove the fat, cut it open and cover with boiling  water. When the water has cooled, remove the kidney, wipe with a cloth,  and pass through it clean sticks to make it stay open. Season with  melted butter, salt and pepper and leave it so prepared for an hour or  two.    Then take another piece of butter and two or three anchovies. Clean the  latter, chop and mix with the butter with the blade of a knife, making a  ball. Cook the kidney on the grill, but not too much, in order to keep  it tender, put it on a plate and grease when hot with the ball of butter  and anchovies.      151    VEAL KIDNEY SLICED    (Rognone di vitello affettato)    Cut in thin slices one or two veal kidneys, removing the granulous part  that is to be found in the middle, and put the slices in a saucepan with  a piece of butter, a bunch of parsley chopped very fine together with a  clove of garlic. Add a cup of hot broth; salt moderately and let it cook  without boiling, until the sauce is reduced to about one third.    One tablespoonful of vinegar adds a pleasant taste to this dish.      152    BROILED MUTTON KIDNEY    (Rognone di montone alla graticola)    After washing the kidneys, remove the filmy skin that covers them and  cut them in the middle without, however, detaching completely the two  parts. Season with salt and pepper, grease with oil and put them on a  strong fire on the grill. After ten or twelve minutes they will be  broiled. Serve hot with parsley and slices of lemon.      153    MUTTON KIDNEY FRIED    (Granelli di montone fritti)    Wash, remove the skin that covers the kidneys and cut in very thin  slices. Wipe with a cloth, dip first in ground bread crumbs, then in a  beaten egg mixed with melted butter, then again in the bread crumbs.  This must be done rapidly, at the time of frying, otherwise the bread  crumbs absorb the moisture of the kidney and make them too hard.    Melt a piece of butter in a saucepan on a strong fire and when it begins  to brown, dip the slices of kidney. Turn often, sprinkle with a little  parsley chopped fine, salt and serve with lemon.      154    BEEF TONGUE BOILED    (Lingua di bue lessa)    The tongue is boiled like the beef. When half cooked remove the skin,  which is not nice to see and has no nutritious elements, although it is  served with a puree of peas, or spinach or potatoes or beans, etc.  But it can be served simply with sprigs of parsley.      155    BEEF TONGUE WITH OLIVES    (Lingua di bue alle olive)    Scald the tongue and peel off the skin. Then put it back to boil until  fully cooked.    Melt a piece of butter and brown half a medium sized onion cut in  slices. When the onion is browned remove it from the butter and dilute  in the latter a teaspoonful of flour. When the flour begins to brown,  thin it with one or two cups of soup stock hot and passed through a  sieve. Mix and boil for ten minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper.    When the sauce is prepared place the tongue in the saucepan containing  it and let it cook again on a low fire for about an hour, turning it  over frequently and keeping it moistened with the gravy.
