Of course when confusion actually exists in a person's mind, a drill on  distinctions is valuable.  But in very many cases no confusion exists,  and in such cases it is worse than unfortunate to introduce it to the  mind.  In any case it is by far the better way to drill upon each word  separately, using it in sentences in as many different ways as possible;  and the more familiar of two words pronounced alike or nearly alike  should be taken up first.  When that is fixed, passing attention may be  given to the less familiar; but it is a great error to give as much  attention to the word that will be little used as to the word which will  be used often.  In the case of a few words such as _principle_ and  _principal, counsel_ and _council,_ confusion is inevitable,  and the method of distinction and contrast must be used;  but even in cases like this, the method of studying each word  exhaustively by itself will undoubtedly yield good results.      Division of Words into Syllables.    In writing it is often necessary to break words at the ends of lines.  This can properly be done only between syllables, and this is the usage  in the United States for the most part, though in Great Britain words  are usually divided so as to show their etymological derivation.    The following rules will show the general usage in this country:    1.  All common English prefixes and suffixes are kept undivided, even  if the pronunciation would seem to require division.  Thus, _tion,_ and  similar endings, _ble, cions,_ etc., are never divided.  The termination  _ed_ may be carried over to the next line even when it is not  pronounced, as in _scorn-ed,_ but this is objectionable and should be  avoided when possible.  When a Latin or other foreign prefix appears in  English as an essential part of the root of the word, and the  pronunciation requires a different division from that which would  separate the original parts, the word is divided as pronounced, as  _pref'ace_ (because we pronounce the _e_ short), _prog'-ress,_ etc.  (The English divide thus: _pre-face, pro-gress_.)    2.  Otherwise, words are divided as pronounced, and the exact division  may be found in the dictionary.  When a vowel is followed by a single  consonant and is short, the consonant stands with the syllable which  precedes it, especially if accented.  Examples: _gram-mat'-ic-al,  math-e-mat'-ics_.  (The people of Great Britain write these words  _gram-ma-ti-cal, ma-the-ma-ti -c{s} a l,_ etc.)    3.  Combinations of consonants forming digraphs are never divided.  Examples: ng, th, ph.    4.  Double consonants are divided.  Examples: _Run-ning, drop-ped_  (if absolutely necessary to divide this word), _sum-mer_.    5.  Two or more consonants, unless they are so united as to form  digraphs or fixed groups, are usually divided according to  pronunciation.  Examples: _pen-sive, sin-gle_ (here the _n_ has the _ng_  nasal sound, and the _g_ is connected with the _l_), _doc-tor,  con-ster-nation, ex-am.-ple, sub-st an-tive_.    6.  A vowel sounded long should as a rule close the syllable, except at  the end of a word.  Examples: _na'-tion_ (we must also write  _na'-tion-al,_ because _tion_ cannot be divided), _di-men'-sion,  deter'min-ate, con-no-ta'-tion_.    Miscellaneous examples: _ex-haust'-ive, pre-par'a-tive,  sen-si-bil'-i-ty, joc'-u-lar-y, pol-y-phon'-ic, op-po'-nent_.      CHAPTER IV.    PRONUNCIATION.    This chapter is designed to serve two practical objects:  First, to aid in the correction and improvement of the pronunciation of  everyday English; second, to give hints that will guide a reader to a  ready and substantially correct pronunciation of strange words and names  that may occasionally be met with.    Accent.    Let us first consider accent.  We have already tried to indicate what  it is.  We will now attempt to find out what principles govern it.    Accent is very closely associated with rhythm.  It has already been stated that a reading of poetry will cultivate an  ear for accent.  If every syllable or articulation of language received  exactly the same stress, or occupied exactly the same time in  pronunciation, speech would have an intolerable monotony, and it would  be impossible to give it what is called \"expression.\" Expression is so  important a part of language that the arts of the orator, the actor, and  the preacher depend directly upon it.  It doubles the value of words.    The foundation of expression is rhythm, or regular succession of stress  and easy gliding over syllables.  In Latin it was a matter of  \"quantity,\" or long and short vowels.  In English it is a mixture of  \"quantity\" (or length and shortness of vowels) and special stress given  by the speaker to bring out the meaning as well as to please the ear.  Hence English has a range and power that Latin could never have had.    In poetry, accent, quantity, and rhythm are exaggerated according to an  artificial plan; but the same principles govern all speech in a greater  or less degree, and even the pronunciation of every word of two  syllables or more.  The fundamental element is \"time\" as we know it in  music.  In music every bar has just so much time allotted to it,  but that time may be variously divided up between different notes.  Thus, suppose the bar is based on the time required for one full note.  We may have in place of one full note two half notes or four quarter  notes, or a half note lengthened by half and followed by two eight  notes, or two quarter notes followed by a half note, and so on.  The total time remains the same, but it may be variously divided,  though not without reference to the way in which other bars in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19721"],[0,"The Literary World Seventh Reader (#12)"],[1,"breast, which was neither painted  nor pricked into strange figures, hung a triple row of pearls; his  mantle was woven of bluebird feathers, as soft and sleek as satin. The  face of this barbarian was as dark, cold, and impassive as death. Behind  that changeless mask, as in a safe retreat, the subtle devil that was  the man might plot destruction and plan the laying of dreadful mines.    I stepped forward and met him on the spot where the fire had been. For a  minute neither spoke. It was true that I had striven against him many a  time, and I knew that he knew it. It was also true that without his aid  Nantaquas could not have rescued us from that dire peril. And it was  again the truth that an Indian neither forgives nor forgets. He was my  saviour, and I knew that mercy had been shown for some dark reason which  I could not divine. Yet I owed him thanks and gave them as shortly and  simply as I could.    He heard me out with neither liking nor disliking nor any other emotion  written upon his face; but when I had finished, as though he had  suddenly bethought himself, he smiled and held out his hand, white-man  fashion.    \"Singing birds have lied to Captain Percy,\" he said. \"Opechancanough  thinks that Captain Percy will never listen to them again. The chief of  the Powhatans is a lover of the white men, of the English, and of other  white men. He would call the Englishmen his brothers and be taught of  them how to rule and to whom to pray\"--    \"Let Opechancanough go with me to Jamestown,\" I replied. \"He hath the  wisdom of the woods; let him come and gain that of the town.\"    The emperor smiled again. \"I will come to Jamestown soon, but not to-day  or to-morrow or the next day. And Captain Percy must smoke the peace  pipe in my lodge above the Pamunkey and watch my young men and maidens  dance, and eat with me five days. Then he may go back to Jamestown with  presents for the great white father there and with a message from me  that I am coming soon to learn of the white man.\"    For five days I tarried in the great chief's lodge in his own village  above the marshes of the Pamunkey. I will allow that the dark emperor to  whom we were so much beholden gave us courteous keeping. The best of the  hunt was ours, the noblest fish, the most delicate roots. We were alive  and sound of limb, well treated and with the promise of release; we  might have waited, seeing that wait we must, in some measure of content.  We did not so. There was a horror in the air. From the marshes that were  growing green, from the sluggish river, from the rotting leaves and cold  black earth and naked forest, it rose like an [v]exhalation. We knew not  what it was, but we breathed it in, and it went to the marrow of our  bones.    The savage emperor we rarely saw, though we were bestowed so near to him  that his sentinels served for ours. Like some god, he kept within his  lodge, the hanging mats between him and the world without. At other  times, issuing from that retirement, he would stride away into the  forest. Picked men went with him, and they were gone for hours; but when  they returned they bore no trophies, brute or human. What they did we  could not guess. If escape had been possible, we would not have awaited  the doubtful fulfillment of the promise made us. But the vigilance of  the Indians never slept; they watched us like hawks, night and day.    In the early morning of the fifth day, when we came from our wigwam, it  was to find Nantaquas sitting by the fire, magnificent in the paint and  trappings of the ambassador, motionless as a piece of bronze and  apparently quite unmindful of the admiring glances of the women who  knelt about the fire preparing our breakfast. When he saw us he rose and  came to meet us, and I embraced him, I was so glad to see him.    \"The Rappahannocks feasted me long,\" he said. \"I was afraid that Captain  Percy would be gone to Jamestown before I was back on the Pamunkey.\"    \"Shall I ever see Jamestown again, Nantaquas?\" I demanded. \"I have my  doubts.\"    He looked me full in the eyes, and there was no doubting the candor of  his own. \"You go with the next sunrise,\" he answered. \"Opechancanough  has given me his word.\"    \"I am glad to hear it,\" I said. \"Why have we been kept at all? Why did  he not free us five days agone?\"    He shook his head. \"I do not know. Opechancanough has many thoughts  which he shares with no man. But now he will send you with presents for  the governor, and with messages of his love for the white men. There  will be a great feast to-day, and to-night the young men and maidens  will dance before you. Then in the morning you will go.\"    When we had sat by the fire for an hour, the old men and the warriors  came to visit us, and the smoking began. The women laid mats in a great  half circle, and each savage took his seat with perfect breeding: that  is, in absolute silence and with a face like a stone. The peace paint  was upon them all--red, or red and white--and they sat and looked at the  ground until I had made the speech of welcome. Soon the air was dense  with fragrant smoke; in the thick blue haze the sweep of painted figures  had the seeming of some fantastic dream. An old man arose and made a  long and touching speech, with much reference to calumets and buried  hatchets. Then they waited for my contribution of honeyed words. The  Pamunkeys, living at a distance from the settlements, had but little  English, and the learning of the Paspaheghs was not much greater. I  repeated to them the better part of a canto of Master Spenser's _Faery  Queen_, after which I told them the moving story of the Moor of Venice.  It answered the purpose to admiration.    The day wore on, with relay after relay of food, which we must taste at  least, with endless smoking of pipes and speeches which must be listened  to and answered. When evening came and our entertainers drew off to  prepare for the dance, they left us as wearied as by a long day's march.    Suddenly, as we sat staring at the fire, we were beset by a band of  maidens, coming out of the woods, painted, with antlers upon their heads  and pine branches in their hands. They danced about us, now advancing  until the green needles met above our heads, now retreating until there  was a space of turf between us. They moved with grace, keeping time to a  plaintive song, now raised by the whole choir, now fallen to a single  voice.    The Indian girls danced more and more swiftly, and their song changed,  becoming gay and shrill and sweet. Higher and higher rang the notes,  faster and faster moved the dark feet; then quite suddenly song and  motion ceased together. From the darkness now came a burst of savage  cries only less appalling than the war whoop itself. In a moment the men  of the village had rushed from the shadow of the trees into the broad,  firelit space before us. They circled around us, then around the fire;  now each man danced and stamped and muttered to himself. For the most  part they were painted red, but some were white from head to  heel--statues come to life--while others had first oiled their bodies,  then plastered them over with small, bright-colored feathers.    Diccon and I watched that uncouth spectacle, that Virginian [v]masque,  as we had watched many another one, with disgust and weariness. It would  last, we knew, for the better part of the night. For a time we must stay  and testify our pleasure, but after a while we might retire, and leave  the women and children the sole spectators. They never wearied of gazing  at the rhythmic movement.    I observed that among the ranks of the women one girl watched not the  dancers but us. Now and then she glanced impatiently at the wheeling  figures, but her eyes always returned to us. At length I became aware  that she must have some message to deliver or warning to give. Once when  I made a slight motion as if to go to her, she shook her head and laid  her finger on her lips.    Presently I rose and, making my way to the werowance of the village,  where he sat with his eyes fixed on the spectacle, told him that I was  wearied and would go to my hut, to rest for the few hours that yet  remained of the night. He listened dreamily, but made no offer to escort  me. After a moment he acquiesced in my departure, and Diccon and I  quietly left the press of savages and began to cross the firelit turf  between them and our lodge. When we had reached its entrance, we paused  and looked back to the throng we had left. Every back seemed turned to  us, every eye intent upon the leaping figures. Swiftly and silently we  walked across the bit of even ground to the friendly trees and found  ourselves in a thin strip of shadow. Beneath the trees, waiting for us,  was the Indian maid. She would not speak or tarry, but flitted before us  as dusk and noiseless as a moth, and we followed her into the darkness  beyond the firelight. Here a wigwam rose in our path; the girl, holding  aside the mats that covered the entrance, motioned to us to enter. A  fire was burning within the lodge and it showed us Nantaquas standing  with folded arms.    \"Nantaquas!\" I exclaimed, and would have touched him but that with a  slight motion of his hand he kept me back.    \"Well!\" I asked at last. \"What is the matter, my friend?\"    For a full minute he made no answer, and when he did speak his voice  matched his strained and troubled features.    \"My _friend_,\" he said, \"I am going to show myself a friend indeed to  the English, to the strangers who were not content with their own  hunting-grounds beyond the great salt water. When I have done this, I do  not know that Captain Percy will call me 'friend'.\"    \"You were wont to speak plainly, Nantaquas,\" I answered him. \"I am not  fond of riddles.\"    Again he waited, as though he found speech difficult. I stared at him in  amazement, he was so changed in so short a time.    He spoke at last: \"When the dance is over and the fires "]]]
