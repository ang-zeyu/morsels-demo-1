And it further appearing by satisfactory proof to the Judge here,       that all the said persons of color are entitled to their freedom       and are free and cannot be held in slavery or involuntary       servitude, it is therefore adjudged that they are entitled to       their freedom, and are free forever. And it further appearing to       the satisfaction of the Judge here that the said Robert Smith       intends and is about to remove from the state of California,       where slavery does not exist, to the state of Texas, where       slavery of Negroes and persons of color does exist and is       established by the municipal laws, and intends to remove said       before mentioned persons of color to his own use, without the       free will and consent of all or any of the said persons of color,       whereby their liberty will be greatly jeopardized, and there is       good reason to apprehend and believe that they may be sold into       slavery or involuntary servitude, and the said Robert Smith is       persuading and enticing and seducing, said persons of color to go       out of the State of California and to be taken and removed       therefrom with the false promise held out to them that they will       be as free in the State of Texas as in the State of California.       And it further appearing that none of said persons of color can       read and write, and are almost entirely ignorant of the laws of       the State of California, as well as those of the State of Texas,       and of their rights, and that the said Robert Smith from his past       relations to them as members of his family, possesses and       exercises over them an undue influence in respect to the matter       of their said removal insomuch that they have been in duress and       not in possession and exercise of their free will so as to give a       binding consent to any engagement or arrangement with him. And it       further appearing that the said Hannah, is aged thirty-four       years, and her daughter, Ann, seventeen years, and all her other       children, to-wit: Lawrence, (aged from twelve to thirteen years)       Nathaniel (aged from ten to eleven years), Jane, (aged eight       years) Charles (aged six years) Marion (aged four years) Martha,       (aged two years) and said infant boy of Hannah aged two weeks, as       well as Mary (aged two years), daughter of said Ann, are under       the age of fourteen years and so under the laws of the State of       California are not competent to choose a Guardian for themselves;       and it further appearing that the said Biddy is aged thirty-eight       years, and the said Ellen is aged seventeen years, and the other       children of said Biddy, to-wit: Ann (aged from twelve to       thirteen) and Harriet (aged eight years) are under the age of       fourteen years, and so by the laws of the State of California are       not competent to choose a Guardian for themselves. It further       appearing that the said infant boy two weeks of age of Hannah is       of tender age and must be kept with his said mother Hannah, the       same is accordingly ordered, and said infant boy is entrusted to       his said mother hereby, and is ordered to appear with him before       the Judge here at the Court House in the City of Los Angeles on       next Monday January 1, 1856 at 10 o'clock A.M. of said day if       her health shall so permit and if not, as soon thereafter as may       be practicable of which the Sheriff of Los Angeles is hereby       notified to notify her the said Hannah and whereof the said       Robert Smith, being now in the Court has notice, it appearing       that she resides in his house and is under his control. And the       said Mary, child of Ann appearing to be of tender age, is       entrusted to the said Ann to be brought before the Judge here at       the time and place aforesaid to be dealt with according to law of       which the said Ann and the said Robert Smith have notice here,       and the said Martha being of tender years is entrusted to the       said Ann, her sister, to be brought before the Judge here at the       time and place aforesaid to be dealt with according to law of       which the said Ann and the said Robert Smith here have notice and       the said Hannah and Ann are appointed Special Guardians       respectively of the children so hereby entrusted to them, and       notified that it is their duty to obey all lawful orders of the       Judge here or of some competent Court touching the premises. And       the further hearing of this case as to the said Hannah and infant       boy and her child, Lawrence and her children Charles and Mary and       Martha is adjourned until said last mentioned time at the Court       House of the City of Los Angeles, and it is further ordered that       the said Nathaniel (aged from ten to twelve years) Jane (aged       eight years) Marion (aged four years) all children of said       Hannah, and said child Ann (aged from twelve to thirteen years)       and Harriet (aged eight years) are committed to the custody of       the Sheriff of Los Angeles County, David W. Alexander, Esq., as       especial Guardian until the further order of the Judge here or of       other Judge or Court of competent Jurisdiction to appoint General       Guardians of aforesaid Children last mentioned, and the said       Sheriff will leave in full liberty and discharge the said Biddy       and her child Ellen (aged Seventeen years) and the said Ann only       being required to obey the said order herinbefore made to appear       before the Judge here in manner and form as aforesaid. And it       further appearing that the said Charles is absent in San       Bernardino County, within said Judicial District. It is ordered       that Robert Clift, Esq.

And it is       further ordered and adjudged that all the costs accrued in the       case up to the present date and in executing the present order of       the Judge here as to the production of the said Hannah and her       said infant two weeks old and said Lawrence, Martha and Mary       before the Judge here as aforesaid shall be paid by the Said       Robert Smith.

THOMAS JEFFERSON'S THOUGHTS ON THE NEGRO      I    Jefferson, like a number of liberal-minded men of his time, execrated  the slave trade and as the following extracts will show held it as a  grievance against the British.         During the regal government we had, at one time, obtained a law       which imposed such a duty on the importation of slaves as       amounted nearly in a prohibition, when one inconsiderate       assembly, placed under a peculiarity of circumstance, repealed       the law. This repeal met a joyful sanction from the then reigning       sovereign, and no devices, no expedients which could ever be       attempted by subsequent assemblies (and they seldom met without       attempting them) could succeed in getting the royal assent to a       renewal of the duty. In the very first session held under the       republican government, the assembly passed a law for the       perpetual prohibition of the importation of slaves. This will, in       some measure, stop the increase of this great political and moral       evil, while the minds of our citizens may be ripening for a       complete emancipation of human nature.[48]         The abolition of domestic slavery is the great object of desire       in those Colonies, where it was, unhappily, introduced in "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20907"],[0,"The Best of the World's Classics,  Restricted to prose. Volume I (of X) - Greece (#12)"],[1,"that the expedition was  coming. At last Hermocrates,[31] the son of Hermon, believing that he  had certain information, came forward, and warned the Syracusans....    Great was the contention which his words aroused among the Syracusan  people, some asserting that the Athenians would never come, and that  he was not speaking truth, others asking, \"And if they should come,  what harm could they do to us nearly so great as we could do to them?\"  while others were quite contemptuous, and made a jest of the whole  matter. A few only believed Hermocrates and realized the danger. At  last Athenagoras, the popular leader, who had at that time the  greatest influence with the multitude, came forward and spoke....    The Athenians and their allies were by this time collected at Corcyra.  There the generals began by holding a final review of the ships, and  disposed them in the order in which they were to anchor at their  stations. The fleet was divided into three squadrons, and one of them  assigned by lot to each of the three generals, in order to avoid any  difficulties which might occur, if they sailed together, in finding  water, anchorage, and provisions where they touched; they thought also  that the presence of a general in each division would promote good  order and discipline throughout the fleet. They then sent before them  to Italy and Sicily three ships, which had orders to find out what  cities in those regions would receive them, and to meet them again on  their way, that they might know before they put in.    At length the great armament proceeded to cross from Corcyra to  Sicily. It consisted of a hundred and thirty-four triremes in all,  besides two Rhodian vessels of fifty oars. Of these a hundred were  Athenian, sixty being swift vessels, and the remaining forty  transports; the rest of the fleet was furnished by the Chians and  other allies. The hoplites numbered in all five thousand one hundred,  of whom fifteen hundred were Athenians taken from the roll, and seven  hundred who served as marines were of the fourth and lowest class of  Athenian citizens. The remainder of the hoplites were furnished by the  allies, mostly by the subject states; but five hundred came from  Argos, besides two hundred and fifty Mantinean and other mercenaries.  The archers were in all four hundred and eighty, of whom eighty were  Cretans. There were seven hundred Rhodian slingers, a hundred and  twenty light-armed Megarians who were exiles, and one horse transport  which conveyed thirty horsemen and horses.    Such were the forces with which the first expedition crossed the sea.  For the transport of provisions thirty merchant-ships, which also  conveyed bakers, masons, carpenters, and tools such as are required in  sieges, were included in the armament. It was likewise attended by a  hundred small vessels; these as well as the merchant-vessels, were  prest into the service. Other merchant-vessels and lesser craft in  great numbers followed of their own accord for purposes of trade. The  whole fleet now struck across the Ionian Sea from Corcyra. They  arrived at the promontory of Iapygia and at Tarentum,[32] each ship  taking its own course, and passed along the coast of Italy. The  Italian cities did not admit them within their walls, or open a market  to them, but allowed them water and anchorage; Tarentum and Locri[33]  refused even these. At length they reached Rhegium,[34] the extreme  point of Italy, where the fleet reunited. As they were not received  within the walls, they encamped outside the city, at the temple of  Artemis; there they were provided by the inhabitants with a market,  and drawing up their ships on shore they took a rest. They held a  conference with the Rhegians, and prest them, being Chalcidians  themselves, to aid their Chalcidian kinsmen the Leontines. But the  Rhegians replied that they would be neutral, and would only act in  accordance with the decision of all the Italian Greeks. The Athenian  commanders now began to consider how they could best commence  operations in Sicily. Meanwhile they were expecting the ships which  had gone on and were to meet them from Egesta;[35] for they wished to  know whether the Egestaeans really had the money of which the  messengers had brought information to Athens.

The Syracusans and the allies naturally thought that the struggle  would be brought to a glorious end if, after having defeated the  Athenian fleet, they took captive the whole of their great armament,  and did not allow them to escape either by sea or land. So they at  once began to close the mouth of the Great Harbor, which was about a  mile wide, by means of triremes, merchant-vessels, and small boats,  placed broadside, which they moored there. They made every preparation  also for a naval engagement, should the Athenians be willing to hazard  another; and all their thoughts were on a grand scale.    The Athenians, seeing the closing of the harbor and inferring the  intentions of the enemy, proceeded to hold a council. The generals and  officers met and considered the difficulties of their position. The  most pressing was the want of food. For they had already sent to  Catana,[37] when they intended to depart, and stopt the supplies; and  they could get no more unless they recovered the command of the sea.  They resolved therefore to quit their lines on the higher ground and  to cut off by a cross-wall a space close to their ships, no greater  than was absolutely required for their baggage and for their sick;  after leaving a guard there, they meant to put on board every other  man, and to launch all their ships, whether fit for service or not;  they would then fight a decisive battle, and, if they conquered, go to  Catana; but if not, they would burn their ships, and retreat by land  in good order, taking the nearest way to some friendly country,  barbarian or Hellenic.    This design they proceeded to execute, and, withdrawing quietly from  the upper walls, manned their whole fleet, compelling every man of any  age at all suitable for service to embark. The entire number of the  ships which they manned was about a hundred and ten. They put on board  numerous archers and javelin-men, Acarnanians,[38] and other  foreigners, and made such preparations for action as the nature of the  plan imposed upon them by their necessities allowed. When all was  nearly ready, Nicias,[39] perceiving that the soldiers were deprest by  their severe defeat at sea, which was no new experience to them,  while at the same time the want of provisions made them impatient to  risk a battle with the least possible delay, called his men together  and before they engaged exhorted them....    Nicias gave orders to man the ships. Gylippus[40] and the Syracusans  could see clearly enough from the preparations which the Athenians  were making that they were going to fight. But they had also previous  notice, and had been told of the iron grapnels; and they took  precautions against this as against all the other devices of the  Athenians. They covered the prows of their vessels with hides,  extending a good way along the upper part of their sides, so that the  grapnels might slip and find no hold. When all was ready, Gylippus and  the other generals exhorted their men....    When Gylippus and the other Syracusan generals had, like Nicias,  encouraged their troops, perceiving the Athenians to be manning their  ships, they presently did the same. Nicias, overwhelmed by the  situation, and seeing how great and how near the peril was (for the  ships were on the very point of rowing out), feeling too, as men do on  the eve of a great struggle, that all which he had done was nothing,  and that he had not said half enough, again addrest the trierarchs,  and calling each of them by his father's name, and his own name, and  the name of his tribe, he entreated those who had made any reputation  for themselves not to be false to it, and those whose ancestors were  eminent not to tarnish their hereditary fame. He reminded them that  they were the inhabitants of the freest country in the world, and how  in Athens there was no interference with the daily life of any man. He  spoke to them of their wives and children and their fathers' gods, as  men will at such a"]]]
