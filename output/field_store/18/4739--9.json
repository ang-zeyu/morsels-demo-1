Finding itself, however, detained by the rope, it  endeavoured to disengage itself in the following ingenious way. Near the  edge of the floe was a crack in the ice of considerable length, but only  eighteen inches or two feet wide, and three or four feet deep. To this  spot the bear turned; and when, on crossing the chasm, the bight of the  rope fell into it, he placed himself across the opening; then suspending  himself by his hind feet, with a leg on each side, he dropped his head and  most part of his body into the chasm; and with a foot applied to each side  of the neck, attempted for some minutes to push the rope over his head.  Finding this scheme ineffectual, he removed to the main ice, and running  with great impetuosity from the ship, gave a remarkable pull on the rope;  then going backward a few steps, he repeated the jerk. At length, after  repeated attempts to escape this way, every failure of which he announced  by a significant growl, he yielded himself to his hard necessity, and lay  down on the ice in angry and sullen silence.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XCIII.    Noble Perseverance.      Elephants were, of old, employed in India in the launching of ships. It is  related of one, that, being directed to force a very large vessel into the  water, the work proved superior to its strength; his master, with  sarcastic tone, bid the keeper take away the lazy beast, and bring  another: the poor animal instantly repeated his efforts, fractured his  skull, and died on the spot.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XCIV.    The Catcher Caught.      During a sudden inundation of the Rhine, a hare, unable to escape through  the water to an eminence, climbed up a tree. One of the boatmen rowing  about to assist the unfortunate inhabitants, observing puss, rowed up to  the tree, and mounted it, eager for the game, without properly fastening  his boat. The terrified hare, on the approach of its pursuer, sprang from  the branch into the boat, which thus set in motion floated away, leaving  its owner in the tree in dread of being washed away by the current. After  several hours' anxiety, he was perceived, and taken off by some of his  companions.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XCV.    Deceiving the Fowler.      A young pointer, out with his master hunting, ran on a brood of very small  partridges. The old bird cried, fluttered, and ran trembling along just  before the dog's nose, till she had drawn him to a considerable distance;  when she took wing and flew farther off, but not out of the field. On this  the dog returned nearly to the place where the young ones lay concealed in  the grass; which the old bird no sooner perceived, than she flew back  again, settled first before the dog's nose, and a second time acted the  same part, rolling and tumbling about till she drew off his attention from  the brood, and thus succeeded in preserving them.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XCVI.    Old Habits.      An eminent Scotch lawyer, having cause to visit London, decided to perform  the journey on horseback in preference to posting, for this was before the  days of railways. He therefore purchased a horse before starting, and on  his arrival at the metropolis, following the usual custom, disposed of his  nag, deciding to purchase another for the return journey. When he had  completed his business, and had decided to set out for home, he went to  Smithfield to purchase a horse. About dusk, a handsome horse was offered  to him at so cheap a rate, that he was led to suspect the animal to be  unsound; but as he could discover no blemish he became the purchaser. Next  morning he set out on his journey; his horse had excellent paces, and the  first few miles, while the road was well frequented, our traveller spent  in congratulating himself on his good fortune. On Finchley Common the  traveller met a clergyman driving a one-horse chaise. There was nobody  within sight, and the horse by his manoeuvre plainly intimated what had  been the profession of his former master. Instead of passing the chaise,  he laid his counter close up to it, and stopped it, having no doubt that  his rider would embrace so fair an opportunity of exercising his vocation.  The clergyman, under the same mistake, produced his purse unasked, and  assured the inoffensive and surprised horseman that it was unnecessary to  draw his pistol. The traveller rallied his horse, with apologies to the  gentleman, whom he had unwillingly affrighted, and pursued his journey.  The horse next made the same suspicious approach to a coach, from the  windows of which a blunderbuss was levelled, with denunciations of death  and destruction to the rider, who was innocent of all offence in deed or  word. In short, after his life had been once or twice endangered by the  suspicions to which his horse's conduct gave rise, and his liberty as  often threatened by peace officers, who were disposed to apprehend him as  a notorious highwayman, he found himself obliged to part with the animal  for a mere trifle, and to purchase at a dearer rate a horse of less  external figure and action, but of better moral habits.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XCVII.    A Philosophic Cat.      A young cat, which sometimes was permitted the indulgence of taking her  place in the domestic circle, upon the carpet before the fire in the  parlour, one day came in when one of the party was spinning upon a line  wheel. Having never seen such a thing before, she became extremely alarmed  by its appearance and motion. She couched down in an attitude of fear and  of investigation; and yet at such a distance as would admit of a speedy  retreat if it should prove to be alive, and an enemy. She crept slowly all  along the wheel, with her eyes steadily fixed on it, and with a very  singular expression of countenance, till at length, not being able to  satisfy herself, she retreated towards the door, impatiently waiting to  make her escape; which she did the moment it was in her power, with great  precipitation.    The next morning, when she came into the room, the wheel then standing  still, she advanced courageously towards it, and after an apparently  careful examination, walking all round, ventured upon the further  experiment of endeavouring to ascertain with her paw whether there was  really anything to be apprehended from it. Still not finding any motion,  our philosopher of the Newtonian school, satisfied that she had nothing to  fear, seated herself quietly by the fire; and the next time she saw it in  motion, she sprang gaily forward, and enjoyed her triumph, by playing with  the object of her former terror.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XCVIII.    An Ass Cast Away.      An ass, belonging to a captain in the Royal Navy, then at Malta, was  shipped on board a frigate, bound from Gibraltar for that island. The  vessel struck on some sands off the Point de Gat, and the ass was thrown  overboard, in the hope that it might possibly be able to swim to the land;  of which, however, there seemed but little chance, for the sea was running  so high, that a boat which left the ship was lost. A few days after, when  the gates of Gibraltar were opened in the morning, the guard were  surprised by Valiant, as the ass was called, presenting himself for  admittance. On entering, he proceeded immediately to the stable of a  merchant, which he had formerly occupied. The poor animal had not only  swam safely to the shore, but without guide, compass, or travelling map,  had found his way from Point de Gat to Gibraltar, a distance of more than  two hundred miles, through a mountainous and intricate country,  intersected by streams, which he had never traversed before, and in so  short a period, that he could not have made one false turn.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE XCIX.    Honours Paid to Living and Departed Worth.      The people of Athens, when they had finished the temple called  _Hecatompedon_, set at liberty the beasts of burden that had been chiefly  employed in that work, suffering them to pasture at large, free from any  further service. It is said that one of these afterwards came of its own  accord to work, and putting itself at the head of the labouring cattle,  marched before them to the citadel. The people were pleased with this  spontaneous action, and made a decree that the animal should be kept at  the public charge as long as it lived. Many have shown particular marks of  regard in burying animals which they had cherished and been fond of. The  graves of Cimon's mares, with which he thrice conquered at the Olympic  games, are still to be seen near his own tomb. Xanthippus, whose dog swam  by the side of his galley to Salamis, when the Athenians were forced to  abandon their city, afterwards buried it with great pomp upon a  promontory, which to this day is called the _Dog's Grave_. In Pliny, we  have an amusing account of a superb funeral ceremony, which took place  during the reign of Claudius; in which the illustrious departed was no  other than a crow, so celebrated for its talents and address, that it was  looked upon as a sort of public property. Its death was felt as a national  loss; the man who killed it was condemned to expiate the crime with his  own life; and nothing less than a public funeral could, as it was thought,  do justice to its memory. The remains of the bird were laid on a bier,  which was borne by two slaves; musicians went before it, playing mournful  airs; and an infinite number of persons, of all ages and conditions,  brought up the rear of the melancholy procession.    [Illustration]          ANECDOTE C.    A Child Saved.      A shepherd, in one of his excursions to look after his flock, took with  him one of his children, an infant of three years old. After traversing  his pastures for some time, attended by his dog, he found it necessary to  ascend a summit at some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24384"],[0,"365 Luncheon Dishes: A Luncheon Dish for Every Day in the Year (#12)"],[1,"on the fire and cook the celery in  it; add pepper and salt, a little nutmeg, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, a  little thickening of butter and flour.
