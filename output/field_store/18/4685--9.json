NOTE.--1. For the fem. nom. sing. and the neut. nom. acc. pl. {diu},    the form {die} was sometimes used; and conversely {diu} for {die} in    the fem. acc. singular. {diu} and {die} were sometimes weakened to    {de}, and to {d'} before words beginning with a vowel. {da[z]} was    sometimes weakened to {de[z]}, and still further to {[z]} which was then    attached to a preceding word, as {l[a]t[z] kind} = {l[a]t da[z] kint};    {an[z]} {in[z]} = {an}, {in da[z]}. {d[e]st}, {deis}, {d[e]s} = {da[z] ist}.      2. The various cases were often fused into one word with    prepositions, as {anme}, {ame}, {am} = {an d[e:]me}; {z[e:]me}, {z[e:]m}    = {ze d[e:]me}; {[u]fme} = {[u]f d[e:]me}; {z[e:]r} = {ze d[e:]r} (fem.);    {[u:]bern} = {[u:]ber d[e:]n}; {[u]f[e:]n} = {[u]f d[e:]n}; {z[e:]n}    = {ze d[e:]n}.

RELATIVE.    Sec. 69.    A relative pronoun proper did not exist in the oldest periods of the  Germanic languages, and accordingly the separate languages expressed it  in various ways. In MHG. the following pronouns and adverbial particles  were used to express it:--    1. {d[e:]r}, {da[z]} (also used as a conjunction), {diu}, also in combination  with the particles {dar der d[a]}. 2. {s[o]}, {als[o]} ({alse}, {als}), _as_;  {sam} ({alsam}), _as_. 3. {d[a](r)}, _where_, {dar}, _thither, whither_,  {darinne}, _therein_, {dannen}, _wherefrom_, {darumbe}, _therefore_,  {d[o]}, _when, as._ 4. Indefinite relatives, as {sw[e:]r} (from {s[o] w[e:]r}),  _whoever_, {swelch}, _each who_, {sw[e:]der}, _who of two_; {sw[a]}, {swar},  _wherever_, {swannen}, {swanne} ({swenne}), _whenever_, {swie},  _however, howsoever._ 5. The conjunction {unde}, _and_.      6. INTERROGATIVE.    Sec. 70.    The MHG. simple interrogative pronoun has no independent form for the  feminine, and is declined in the singular only.              _Masc. Fem._    _Neut._      Nom.    w[e:]r, _who_        wa[z]    Acc.    w[e:]n               wa[z]    Gen.    w[e:]s               w[e:]s    Dat.    w[e:]m(e)            w[e:]m(e)    Instr.                    wiu    In the same manner are declined the compounds:    {sw[e:]r} (from {s[o] w[e:]r}), _whoever_, {etew[e:]r}, {etesw[e:]r}, _anyone_,  {nei[z]w[e:]r} (= {ne wei[z] w[e:]r}, _I do not know who_), _anyone_.    {w[e:]der}, _who of two_, is declined like a strong adjective; {wel[i]ch}  ({welch}), _which_, is also declined like a strong adjective, but the  nom. singular remains uninflected.      7. INDEFINITE.    Sec. 71.    {ander}, _other_; {dechein}, {dehein}, {dekein}, _no, none_; {dew[e:]der},  _neither_; {ein}, _one, some one_: when {ein} is used with the meaning  _alone_ it follows the weak declension; {etel[i]ch}, {etl[i]ch}, {etesl[i]ch},  {etsl[i]ch}, _anyone, many a_, pl. = _some_; {etew[e:]r}, {etesw[e:]r},  _anyone_; {etewa[z]}, _anything_; {iegel[i]ch}, {iesl[i]ch}, {iegesl[i]ch},  _each_; {ieman}, {iemen}, _someone, somebody_; {iew[e:]der}, {ietw[e:]der},  _each_; {iewel[i]ch}, {iewelich}, _each_; {iewiht}, {iht}, _anything_;  {kein}, _no_; {man}, _one_; {manec}, _many a_, declined {maneger},  {manege[z]}, {manegiu}, &c.; {nehein}, _no, none_; {niht}, _nothing_;  {solch}, _such_, declined like {manec}; {sum}, _any one at all_, pl.  _some_; {sumel[i]ch}, {suml[i]ch}, _many a_; {swelch}, _each who_; {sw[e:]r},  _whoever_; {w[e:]der}, _which of two_; {wel[i]ch} ({welch}), _which_,  declined like {manec}.          CHAPTER VI      VERBS    Sec. 72.    The MHG. verb has the following independent forms:--one voice (active),  two numbers, three persons, two tenses (present and preterite), two  complete moods (indicative and subjunctive, the latter originally the  optative), besides an imperative which is only used in the present  tense; two verbal nouns (the present infinitive, and the gerund,  generally called the inflected infinitive), a present participle with  active meaning, and one verbal adjective (the past participle).    The MHG. verbs are divided into two great classes:--Strong and Weak. The  strong verbs form their preterite (originally the perfect) and past  participle by means of ablaut (Sec. 12). The weak verbs form their preterite  by the addition of the syllable {-te}, and their past participle by  means of a {t}-suffix. The strong verbs were originally further  sub-divided into reduplicated and non-reduplicated verbs. The  reduplication had, however, entirely disappeared in the oldest period of  the language. The non-reduplicated verbs are divided into six classes  according to the six ablaut-series (Sec. 12). The originally reduplicated  verbs are put together here and called Class VII. Besides these two  great classes of strong and weak verbs, there are a few others which  will be treated under the general heading _Minor Groups_.      A. STRONG VERBS.    Sec. 73.    We are able to conjugate a MHG. strong verb when we know the four stems,  as seen in (1) the infinitive or first pers. sing. of the present  indicative, (2) the first or third pers. sing. of the preterite  indicative, (3) the first pers. plural of the preterite indicative, (4)  the past participle. The pret. subjunctive and the second pers. pret.  indicative have the same stem-vowel as the pret. plural indicative.      Sec. 74.    The conjugation of {n[e:]men}, OHG. {n[e:]man}, _to take_, will serve as a  model for all strong verbs.                                  _Present._                 INDIC.

OHG.             genomen    ginoman      NOTE.--The {e} in the endings is regularly lost according to the    rule given in Sec. 9,1, as sing. {stil}, {stilst}, {stilt}, inf.    {st[e:]ln}, _to steal_; sing. {var}, {verst}, {vert}, inf. {varn}, _to    go_. It was also frequently lost in the third pers. sing. pres.    indicative of other verbs, as {vint} = {vindet}, {siht} = {sihet},    see Sec. 9,4 note. The {n} in the first pers. plural was sometimes    dropped when the pronoun came after the verb, as {n[e:]me wir} = {n[e:]men    wir}.      The imperative singular sometimes has {-e} after the analogy of weak    verbs (Sec. 90).      The OHG. forms given above show in what forms umlaut regularly took    place, viz. in the second and third pers. singular of the pres.    indicative, when possible, in the second pers. singular of the pret.    indicative, and in the pret. subjunctive. The second pers. singular    of the pret. indicative always has the same stem-vowel as the pret.    subjunctive. On the absence of umlaut in the pret. subjunctive of    certain types of verbs, see Sec. 10, note. Forms without and with umlaut    are found in the second and third pers. singular of the present in    verbs belonging to Class VII, as {sl[a]fes(t)}, {sl[a]fet} beside    {sl[ae]fes(t)}, {sl[ae]fet}.      Concerning the changes between {i, [e:]}; {u, o}; {iu}, {ie}; {ei, [e]};    {ou, [o]} in the various classes of strong verbs, see Secs. 14-17.      THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE STRONG"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22656"],[0,"Red Cap Tales, Stolen from the Treasure Chest of the Wizard of the North (#12)"],[1,"beside him, he moaned out, \"Oh, why did  you leave us, Squire?\" Then in broken accents he told how a certain  pedlar called Ruffin had shown them letters from Edward, advising them  to rise in mutiny.    \"Ruffin!\" said Edward, \"I know nothing of any such man. You have been  vilely imposed upon, Houghton.\"    \"Indeed,\" said the dying man, \"I often thought so since. And we did not  believe till he showed us your very seal. So Tims was shot, and I was  reduced to the ranks.\"    Not long after uttering these words, poor Houghton breathed his last,  praying his young master to be kind to his old father and mother at  Waverley-Honour, and not to fight with these wild petticoat men against  old England.    The words cut Edward to the heart, but there was no time for sentiment  or regret. The army of the Prince was fast approaching the foe. The  English regiments came marching out to meet them along the open shore,  while the Highlanders took their station on the higher ground to the  south. But a morass separated the combatants, and though several  skirmishes took place on the flanks, the main fighting had to be put off  till another day. That night both sides slept on their arms, Fergus and  Waverley joining their plaids to make a couch, on which they lay, with  Callum Beg watching at their heads.    Before three, they were summoned to the presence of the Prince. They  found him giving his final directions to the chiefs. A guide had been  found who would guide the army across the morass. They would then turn  the enemy's flank, and after that the Highland yell and the Highland  claymore must do the rest.    The mist of the morning was still rolling thick through the hollow  between the armies when Clan Ivor got the word to charge. Prestonpans  was no midnight surprise. The English army, regularly ranked, stood  ready, waiting. But their cavalry, suddenly giving way, proved  themselves quite unable to withstand the furious onslaught of the  Highlanders. Edward charged with the others, and was soon in the  thickest of the fray. It happened that while fighting on the battle  line, he was able to save the life of a distinguished English officer,  who, with the hilt of his broken sword yet in his hand, stood by the  artillery from which the gunners had run away, disdaining flight and  waiting for death. The victory of the Highlanders was complete. Edward  even saw his old commander, Colonel Gardiner, struck down, yet was  powerless to save him. But long after, the reproach in the eyes of the  dying soldier haunted him. Yet it expressed more sorrow than  anger--sorrow to see him in such a place and in such a dress.    But this was soon forgotten when the prisoner he had taken, and whom the  policy of the Prince committed to his care and custody, declared himself  as none other than Colonel Talbot, his uncle's dearest and most intimate  friend. He informed Waverley that on his return from abroad he had found  both Sir Everard and his brother in custody on account of Edward's  reported treason. He had, therefore, immediately started for Scotland to  endeavour to bring back the truant. He had seen Colonel Gardiner, and  had found him, after having made a less hasty inquiry into the mutiny  of Edward's troop, much softened toward the young man. All would have  come right, concluded Colonel Talbot, had it not been for our hero's  joining openly with the rebels in their mad venture.    Edward was smitten to the heart when he heard of his uncle's sufferings,  believing that they were on his account. But he was somewhat comforted  when Colonel Talbot told him that through his influence Sir Everard had  been allowed out under heavy bail, and that Mr. Richard Waverley was  with him at Waverley-Honour.    Yet more torn with remorse was Edward when, having once more arrived in  Edinburgh, he found at last the leather valise which contained the  packet of letters Alice Bean Lean had placed among his linen. From these  he learned that Colonel Gardiner had thrice written to him, once indeed  sending the letter by one of the men of Edward's own troop, who had been  instructed by the pedlar to go back and tell the Colonel that his  officer had received them in person. Instead of being delivered to  Waverley, the letters had been given to a certain Mr. William Ruffin, or  Riven, or Ruthven, whom Waverley saw at once could be none other than  Donald Bean Lean himself. Then all at once remembering the business of  the robber cave, he understood the loss of his seal, and poor Houghton's  dying reproach that he should not have left the lads of his troop so  long by themselves.    Edward now saw clearly how in a moment of weakness he had made a great  and fatal mistake by joining with the Jacobites. But his sense of honour  was such that in spite of all Colonel Talbot could say, he would not go  back on his word. His own hastiness, the clever wiles of Fergus  Mac-Ivor, Flora's beauty, and most of all the rascality of Donald Bean  Lean had indeed brought his neck, as old Major Melville had prophesied,  within the compass of the hangman's rope.    The best Edward could now do was to send a young soldier of his troop,  who had been taken at Prestonpans, to his uncle and his father with  letters explaining all the circumstances. By Colonel Talbot's advice and  help this messenger was sent aboard one of the English vessels cruising  in the Firth, well furnished with passes which would carry him in safety  all the way to Waverley-Honour.    Still the days went by, and nothing was done. Still the Prince halted in  Edinburgh waiting for reinforcements which never came. He was always  hopeful that more clans would declare for him or that other forces would  be raised in the Lowlands or in England. And meanwhile, chiefly because  in the city there was nothing for them to do, plans and plots were being  formed. Quarrellings and jealousies became the order of the day among  the troops of the White Cockade. One morning Fergus Mac-Ivor came in to  Edward's lodgings, furious with anger because the Prince had refused him  two requests,--one, to make good his right to be an Earl, and the other,  to give his consent to his marriage with Rose Bradwardine. Fergus must  wait for the first, the Prince had told him, because that would offend a  chief of his own name and of greater power, who was still hesitating  whether or not to declare for King James. As for Rose Bradwardine,  neither must he think of her. Her affections were already engaged. The  Prince knew this privately, and, indeed, had promised already to favour  the match upon which her heart was set.    As for Edward himself, he began about this time to think less and less  of the cruelty of Flora Mac-Ivor. He could not have the moon, that was  clear--and he was not a child to go on crying for it. It was evident,  also, that Rose Bradwardine liked him, and her marked favour, and her  desire to be with him, had their effect upon a heart still sore from  Flora's repeated and haughty rejections.    One of the last things Edward was able to do in Edinburgh, was to obtain  from the Prince the release of Colonel Talbot, whom he saw safely on his  way to London from the port of Leith. After that it was with actual  relief that Edward found the period of waiting in Edinburgh at last at  an end, and the Prince's army to the number of six thousand men marching  southward into England. All was now to be hazarded on the success of a  bold push for London.    The Highlanders easily escaped a superior army encamped on the borders.  They attacked and took Carlisle on their way, and at first it seemed as  if they had a clear path to the capital before them. Fergus, who marched  with his clan in the van of the Prince's army, never questioned their  success for a moment. But Edward's clearer eye and greater knowledge of  the odds made no such mistake.    He saw that few joined them, and those men of no great weight, while all  the time the forces of King George were daily increasing. Difficulties  of every kind arose about them the farther they marched from their  native land. Added to which there were quarrels and dissensions among  the Prince's followers, those between his Irish officers and such  Highland chiefs as Fergus being especially bitter.    Even to Edward, Fergus became fierce and sullen, quite unlike his former  gay and confident self. It was about Flora that the quarrel, long  smouldering, finally broke into flame. As they passed this and that  country-seat, Fergus would always ask if the house were as large as  Waverley-Honour, and whether the estate or the deer park were of equal  size. Edward had usually to reply that they were not nearly so great.  Whereupon Fergus would remark that in that case Flora would be a happy  woman.    \"But,\" said Waverley, who tired of the implied obligation, \"you forget  Miss Flora has refused me, not once, but many times. I am therefore  reluctantly compelled to resign all claims upon her hand.\"    At this, Fergus thought fit to take offence, saying that having once  made application for Flora's hand, Waverley had no right to withdraw  from his offer without the consent of her guardian. Edward replied that  so far as he was concerned, the matter was at an end. He would never  press himself upon any lady who had repeatedly refused him.    Whereupon, Fergus turned away furiously, and the quarrel was made.  Edward betook himself to the camp of his old friend, the Baron, and, as  he remembered the instruction he had received in the dragoons, he became  easily a leader and a great favourite among the Lowland cavalry which  followed the old soldier Bradwardine.    But he had left seeds of bitter anger behind him in the camp of the  proud clan he had quitted.    Some of the Lowland officers warned him of his danger, and Evan Dhu, the  Chief's foster-brother--who, ever since the visit to the cave had taken  a liking to Edward--waited for him secretly in a shady place and bade  "]]]
