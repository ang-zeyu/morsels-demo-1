Before the house lay a peaceful garden surrounded by a wall, and with  its paths laid with marble slabs. Here lilacs blossomed, and here I  could dream the whole day away amidst the perfume of roses. Gold-fishes  swam in a basin of crystal-clear water, and a tiny jet shot up into the  air glittering like a spider's web in the sunshine. I slept in this  enchanting garden at night, and when I awoke in the morning I could  hardly believe that all was real; it was so like an adventure from the  _Thousand and one Nights_. My rich host and my secretaries did not  suspect that I had only sixpence in my pocket.    When the last day came I could no longer conceal my destitute condition.  \"I have something unpleasant to confide to you,\" I said to one of the  secretaries. \"Indeed,\" he answered, looking very astonished. \"Yes, my  money has come to an end. My journey has been longer than I expected,  and now I am quite cleared out.\" \"What does that matter? You can get as  much money as you like from Agha Hassan.\"    It had struck midnight when I went to take farewell of my kind host. He  worked all night during the fasting month. \"I am sorry that you cannot  stay longer,\" he said. \"Yes, I too am sorry that I must leave you, and  that I can never repay your great kindness to me.\" \"You know that the  road through the hills is unsafe owing to robbers and footpads. I have  therefore arranged that you shall accompany the post, which is escorted  by three soldiers.\"    Having thanked him once more, I took my leave. A secretary handed me a  leather purse full of silver. The post rider and the soldiers were  ready; we mounted, rode slowly through the dark, narrow streets of the  town, at a smart trot when the houses were scattered, and then at full  gallop when the desert stretched around us on all sides. We rode 105  miles in sixteen hours, with three relays of horses and barely an hour's  rest. We stayed a day at Hamadan, and then rode on to the capital, with  nine relays of fresh horses. During the last fifty-five hours I never  went to sleep, but often dozed in the saddle. At length the domes of  Teheran, its poplars and plane-trees, stood out against the morning sky,  and, half-dead with weariness, and ragged and torn, I rode through the  south-western gate of the city.    FOOTNOTES:    [7] At the time of this journey, the railway ended at Vladikavkas. Since  then, however, it has been extended to Baku along the northern side of  the Caucasus and the coast of the Caspian (see map, p. 30).          IV    THE PERSIAN DESERT (1906)      ACROSS THE KEVIR    We must now resume the journey to India. You will remember (see p. 33)  that after arriving at Teheran from Trebizond I made up a caravan  consisting of six Persians, one Tatar, and fourteen camels. On January 1  everything is ready. The camels are all laden; thick rugs cover their  backs to prevent them being rubbed sore by the loads, and the humps  stick up through two round holes in the cloths in order that they may  not be crushed and injured.    The largest camels go first. Each has its head adorned with a red  embroidered headstall, studded with shining plates of metal and red and  yellow pompons, and a plume waves above its forehead. Round the chest is  a row of brass sleigh-bells, and one large bell hangs round the neck.  Two of these bells are like small church bells; they are so big that the  camels would knock their knees against them if they were hung in the  usual way, so they are fastened instead to the outer sides of a couple  of boxes on the top of the loads. The camels are proud of being decked  so finely; they are conscious of their own importance, and stalk with  majestic, measured strides through the southern gate of Teheran.    My riding camel is the largest in the caravan (Plate V.). He has thick  brown wool, unusually long and plentiful on his neck and chest. His  loads form a small platform between the humps and along his flanks, with  a hollow in the middle, where I sit as in an armchair, with a leg on  each side of the front hump. From there I can spy out the land, and with  the help of a compass put down on my map everything I see--hills, sandy  zones, and large ravines. Camels put out the two left legs at the same  time, and then the two right legs. Their gait is therefore rolling, and  the rider sits as in a small boat pitching and tossing in a broken sea.  Some people become sea-sick from sitting all day bobbing between the  humps, but one soon becomes accustomed to the motion. When the animal is  standing up it is, of course, impossible to mount on his back without a  ladder, so he has to lie down to let me get on him. But sometimes it  happens that he is in too great a hurry to rise before I am settled in  my place, and then I am flung back on to my head, for he lifts himself  as quickly as a steel spring, first with the hind legs and then with the  fore. But when I am up I am quite at home. Sometimes, on the march, the  camel turns his long neck and lays his shaggy head on my knee. I pat his  nose and stroke him over the eyes. It is impossible to be other than  good friends with an animal which carries you ten hours a day for  several months. In the morning he comes up to my tent, pushes his nose  under the door-flap, and thrusts his shaggy head into the tent, which is  not large, and is almost filled up when he comes on a visit. After he  has been given a piece of bread he backs out again and goes away to  graze.    [Illustration: PLATE V. THE AUTHOR'S RIDING CAMEL, WITH GULAM HUSSEIN.]    The ring of bells is continually in my ears. The large bells beat in  time with the steps of the camels. Their strides are long and slow, and  a caravan seldom travels more than twenty miles in a day.    Our road runs south-eastwards. We have soon left behind us the districts  at the foot of the Elburz Mountains, where irrigation canals from rivers  are able to produce beautiful gardens and fruitful fields. The farther  we proceed the smaller and more scattered are the villages. Only along  their canals is the soil clothed with verdure, and we have scarcely left  a village before we are out on the greyish-yellow desert, where withered  steppe shrubs stand at wide intervals apart. Less and less frequently do  we meet trains of asses bound for Teheran with great bundles of shrubs  and bushes from the steppe to be used as fuel. The animals are small and  miserable, and are nearly hidden by their loads. Their nostrils are  cruelly pierced, so that they may be made to go quicker and keep up  longer. They look sleepy and dejected, these small, obstinate donkeys  which never move out of the way. Their long ears flap backwards and  forwards, and their under-lips hang down like bags.    At the very last village on the edge of the desert we stay two days to  prepare ourselves for the dangers ahead of us. The headman of the  village owns ten camels, which he will gladly hire us for a few days;  they are to carry trusses of straw and water in leathern bags. Our own  camels are already fully laden, and the hired camels are only to give us  a start. When they turn back we shall have to shift for ourselves.    After we have left this village not a sign of life is visible. Before us  to the south-east small isolated hills stand up like islands in the sea,  and beyond them the horizon of the desert lies as level as that of the  ocean. Through this great sandy waste the caravans travel from oasis to  oasis, but in the north there is a tract, called the Kevir, within which  not the smallest oasis can be found. Not a clump of grass, not even a  blade, is to be seen, for the desert is saturated with salt, and when it  rains in winter the briny clay becomes as slippery as ice. And this is  precisely the place we are making for.    We travelled a whole month before we came to the point where we intended  to make the attempt to cross the Kevir. Hitherto everything had  continued in a steady course, and one day had been like another. It was  winter and we had fully 25 degrees of frost in the night: one day it  snowed so thickly that the foremost camels in the train were seen only  as faint shadows. For several days mist lay so dense over the desert  that we had to trust chiefly to the compass. Sometimes we travelled for  four or five days without finding a drop of water, but we had all we  needed in our leathern bags.    At the edge of the sandy desert, where high dunes are piled up by the  wind, tamarisks and saxauls were often growing. Both are steppe bushes  which grow to a height of several feet; their stems are hard and  provided us with excellent fuel. My servants gathered large faggots, and  the camp fires flamed up brightly and grandly, throwing a yellow light  over the silent waste.    From a village called Jandak I set out with only two men and four  camels, but we had to wait for four days on the edge of the salt desert  because of rain. When rain falls in the Kevir the whole desert soon  becomes a sea of slippery mud, and camels cannot walk without slipping  and falling. Whole caravans have perished in this cruel desert by being  overtaken by rain, and in many other cases the men only have managed to  escape with the loss of their camels and their merchandise. It was  therefore fortunate for us that we were overtaken by rain before we were  out on the slippery clay. We waited till the desert had dried up again,  and then we joined forces with a caravan which came from the south.    It was pitch dark when we began to move. A fire was set going, and the  camels were laden by its light. Then we started, the fire disappeared,  and night and the desert lay before us. Only the ring of bells disturbed  the silence. We could not see where we were going, but had to trust our  riding camels. The Persians marched all the morning and most of the day  without a halt; the strength of both men and camels is strained to the  uttermost in order to get through the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2071"],[0,"Stories (#12)"],[1,"ndless, but of the will to do mighty things;  and of how he would say to them always, if they sought to bless his  name, \"Nay, do not thank me--thank Rubens. Without him, what should I  have been?\" And these dreams--beautiful, impossible, innocent, free of  all selfishness, full of heroical worship--were so closely about him as  he went that he was happy--happy even on this sad anniversary of Alois's  saint's day, when he and Patrasche went home by themselves to the little  dark hut and the meal of black bread, while in the mill-house all the  children of the village sang and laughed, and ate the big round cakes  of Dijon and the almond gingerbread of Brabant, and danced in the great  barn to the light of the stars and the music of flute and fiddle.    \"Never mind, Patrasche,\" he said, with his arms round the dog's neck, as  they both sat in the door of the hut, where the sounds of the mirth at  the mill came down to them on the night air; \"never mind. It shall all  be changed by-and-by.\"    He believed in the future; Patrasche, of more experience and of more  philosophy, thought that the loss of the mill supper in the present was  ill compensated by dreams of milk and honey in some vague hereafter. And  Patrasche growled whenever he passed by Baas Cogez.    \"This is Alois's name-day, is it not?\" said the old man Daas that night,  from the corner where he was stretched upon his bed of sacking.    The boy gave a gesture of assent; he wished that the old man's memory  had erred a little, instead of keeping such sure account.    \"And why not there?\" his grandfather pursued. \"Thou hast never missed a  year before, Nello.\"    \"Thou art too sick to leave,\" murmured the lad, bending his handsome  head over the bed.    \"Tut! tut! Mother Nulette would have come and sat with me, as she does  scores of times. What is the cause, Nello?\" the old man persisted. \"Thou  surely hast not had ill words with the little one?\"    \"Nay, grandfather, never,\" said the boy quickly, with a hot colour in  his bent face. \"Simply and truly, Baas Cogez did not have me asked this  year. He has taken some whim against me.\"    \"But thou hast done nothing wrong?\"    \"That I know--nothing. I took the portrait of Alois on a piece of pine;  that is all.\"    \"Ah!\" The old man was silent; the truth suggested itself to him with  the boy's innocent answer. He was tied to a bed of dried leaves in the  corner of a wattle hut, but he had not wholly forgotten what the ways of  the world were like.    He drew Nello's fair head fondly to his breast with a tenderer gesture.  \"Thou art very poor, my child,\" he said, with a quiver the more in his  aged, trembling voice; \"so poor! It is very hard for thee.\"    \"Nay, I am rich,\" murmured Nello; and in his innocence he thought so;  rich with the imperishable powers that are mightier than the might of  kings. And he went and stood by the door of the hut in the quiet autumn  night, and watched the stars troop by and the tall poplars bend and  shiver in the wind. All the casements of the mill-house were lighted,  and every now and then the notes of the flute came to him. The tears  fell down his cheeks, for he was but a child; yet he smiled, for he said  to himself, \"In the future!\" He stayed there until all was quite still  and dark; then he and Patrasche went within and slept together, long and  deeply, side by side.    Now he had a secret which only Patrasche knew. There was a little  outhouse to the hut which no one entered but himself--a dreary place,  but with abundant clear light from the north. Here he had fashioned  himself rudely an easel in rough lumber, and here, on a great gray sea  of stretched paper, he had given shape to one of the innumerable fancies  which possessed his brain. No one had ever taught him anything; colours  he had no means to buy; he had gone without bread many a time to procure  even the few rude vehicles that he had here; and it was only in black or  white that he could fashion the things he saw. This great figure which  he had drawn here in chalk was only an old man sitting on a fallen  tree--only that. He had seen old Michel, the woodman, sitting so at  evening many a time. He had never had a soul to tell him of outline  or perspective, of anatomy or of shadow; and yet he had given all  the weary, worn-out age, all the sad, quiet patience, all the rugged,  care-worn pathos of his original, and given them so that the old, lonely  figure was a poem, sitting there meditative and alone, on the dead tree,  with the darkness of the descending night behind him.    It was rude, of course, in a way, and had many faults, no doubt; and yet  it was real, true in nature, true in art, and very mournful, and in a  manner beautiful.    Patrasche had lain quiet countless hours watching its gradual creation  after the labor of each day was done, and he knew that Nello had a  hope--vain and wild perhaps, but strongly cherished--of sending this  great drawing to compete for a prize of two hundred francs a year  which it was announced in Antwerp would be open to every lad of talent,  scholar or peasant, under eighteen, who would attempt to win it with  some unaided work of chalk or pencil. Three of the foremost artists in  the town of Rubens were to be the judges and elect the victor according  to his merits.    All the spring and summer and autumn Nello had been at work upon this  treasure, which if triumphant, would build him his first step toward  independence and the mysteries of the art which he blindly, ignorantly,  and yet passionately adored.    He said nothing to any one; his grandfather would not have understood,  and little Alois was lost to him. Only to Patrasche he told all, and  whispered, \"Rubens would give it me, I think, if he knew.\"    Patrasche thought so too, for he knew that Rubens had loved dogs or he  had never painted them with such exquisite fidelity; and men who loved  dogs were, as Patrasche knew, always pitiful.    The drawings were to go in on the first day of December, and the  decision be given on the twenty-fourth, so that he who should win might  rejoice with all his people at the Christmas season.    In the twilight of a bitter wintry day, and with a beating heart, now  quick with hope, now faint with fear, Nello placed the great picture  on his little green milk-cart, and took it, with the help of Patrasche,  into the town, and there left it, as enjoined, at the doors of a public  building.    \"Perhaps it is worth nothing at all. How can I tell?\" he thought, with  the heart-sickness of a great timidity. Now that he had left it there,  it seemed to him so hazardous, so vain, so foolish, to dream that he, a  little lad with bare feet who barely knew his letters, could do anything  at which great painters, real artists, could ever deign to look. Yet he  took heart as he went by the cathedral; the lordly form of Rubens seemed  to rise from the fog and the darkness, and to loom in its magnificence  before him, while the lips, with their kindly smile, seemed to him to  murmur, \"Nay, have courage! It was not by a weak heart and by faint  fears that I wrote my name for all time upon Antwerp.\"    Nello ran home through the cold night, comforted. He had done his  best; the rest must be as God willed, he thought, in that innocent,  unquestioning faith which had been taught him in the little gray chapel  among the willows and the poplar-trees.    The winter was very sharp already. That night, after they reached the  hut, snow fell, and fell for very many days after that; so that the  paths and the divisions in the fields were all obliterated, and all  the smaller streams were frozen over, and the cold was intense upon the  plains. Then, indeed, it became hard work to go round for the milk while  the world was all dark, and carry it through the darkness to the silent  town. Hard work, especially for Patrasche, for the passage of the years  that were only bringing Nello a stronger youth were bringing him old  age, and his joints were stiff and his bones ached often. But he would  never give up his share of the labour. Nello would fain have spared him  and drawn the cart himself, but Patrasche would not allow it. All he  would ever permit or accept was the help of a thrust from behind to the  truck as it lumbered along through the ice-ruts. Patrasche had lived in  harness, and he was proud of it. He suffered a great deal sometimes from  frost and the terrible roads and the rheumatic pains of his limbs; but  he only drew his breath hard and bent his stout neck, and trod onward  with steady patience.    \"Rest thee at home, Patrasche; it is time thou didst rest, and I can  quite well push in the cart by myself,\" urged Nello many a morning; but  Patrasche, who understood him aright, would no more have consented  to stay at home than a veteran soldier to shirk when the charge was  sounding; and every day he would rise and place himself in his shafts,  and plod along over the snow through the fields that his four round feet  had left their print upon so many, many years.    \"One must never rest till one dies,\" thought Patrasche; and sometimes it  seemed to him that that time of rest for him was not very far off. His  sight was less clear than it had been, and it gave him pain to rise  after the night's sleep, though he would never lie a moment in his straw  when once the bell of the chapel tolling five let him know that the  daybreak of labor had begun.    \"My poor Patrasche, we shall soon lie quiet together, you and I,\" said  old Jehan Daas, stretching out to stroke the head of Patrasche with the  old withered hand which had always shared with him its one poor crust of  bread; and the hearts of the old man and the old dog ached together with  one thought: When they were gone who would care for their darling?    One afternoon, as they came back from Antwerp over the snow, which had  become hard and smooth as marble over all the Flemish plains, they found  dropped in the road a pretty"]]]
