It  was ordered, that no attempt should be made to capture or restrain such  aborigines as might approach the settlement; but that, after supplying  them with food, they should be suffered to depart.    He found it necessary to explain the conditions on which rewards were  offered for capture, which had been abused, by the violent detention of  inoffensive natives: those who, in attempting to arrest them, were  guilty of wanton mischief, were threatened with the penalties of the  law. These orders were followed by outrages, which threw doubt on the  propriety of distinctions: the ally of to-day, was the robber of  yesterday, and the assassin of the morrow. The natives of the south-west  districts of the colony, and of the islands, were still exempted from  proscription; but an explanatory notice, authorised the settlers, by  whatever necessary means, to anticipate, or repel, the barbarous  attacks, now renewed with terrible frequency and atrocity.    These public instructions indicate the alternate feelings which  prevailed: they were natural to men who, reflecting on the origin of the  warfare, felt that measures, now indispensable, were not wholly  guiltless.                       *     *     *     *     *         OFFICIAL LIST OF ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY THE NATIVES.         1830.--January 1.

They took away blankets, shirts,       sheets, knives, 600 or 700 lbs. of flour (which they tied up), half       a basket of tobacco, 100 lbs. of sugar, a bag of tea, and a       considerable quantity of slop clothing: so great ingenuity was       displayed in the attack, that for some time it was supposed that       Europeans had conducted it.

Narayana there reveals himself to Narada, and sets  forth to him the doctrine of Vasudeva. According to this, Narayana has  four forms, called _murtis_ or _vyuhas_. The first of these is  Vasudeva, who is the highest soul and creator and inwardly controls  all individual souls. From him arose Samkarshana, who corresponds to  the individual soul; from Samkarshana issued Pradyumna, to whom  corresponds the organ of mind, and from Pradyumna came forth  Aniruddha, representing the element of self-consciousness. Observe in  passing that these are all names of heroes of legend: Samkarshana is  Vasudeva's brother Bala-rama, Pradyumna was the son and Aniruddha the  grandson of Vasudeva. Narayana then goes on to speak of the creation  of all things from himself and their dissolution into himself, and of  his incarnations in the form of the Boar who lifted up on his tusk the  earth when submerged under the ocean, Narasimha the Man-lion who  destroyed the tyrant Hiranya-kasipu, the Dwarf who overthrew Bali,  Rama Bhargava who destroyed the Kshatriyas, Rama Dasarathi, of whom we  shall have something to say later. Krishna Vasudeva the slayer of  Kamsa of Mathura, the Tortoise, the Fish, and Kalki. Then follow some  further details, among them a statement that this doctrine was  revealed to Arjuna at the beginning of the Great War--a clear  reference to the Bhagavad-gita--that at the beginning of every age it  was promulgated by Narayana, that it requires activity in pious works,  that at the commencement of the present age it passed from him to  Brahma, from him to Vivasvan the Sun-god, from him to the patriarch  Manu, etc., that it does not allow the sacrifice of animals, and that  for salvation the co-operative grace of Narayana is necessary. Most of  this doctrine is already in the Bhagavad-gita; what is not found in  the latter is the account of the mysterious White Island, the theory  of _vyuhas_ or emanations, which represents Vasudeva as issuing from  Narayana and so forth, and the details of Narayana's incarnations. It  is therefore a distinct textbook of the Satvata or Pancharatra church,  not much later than the Bhagavad-gita. According to it, the Supreme  Being is Narayana, the Almighty God who reveals himself as highest  teacher and saintly sage, whose legendary performance of a five-days'  sacrifice (above, p. 76) has gained for his doctrine the title of  Pancharatra. Next in order of divinity is Krishna Vasudeva, whose  tribal name of Satvata has furnished the other name of this church;  then follow in due order Samkarshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, all of  his family; and with Vasudeva is closely associated the epic hero  Arjuna, a prototype for this mortal pair being discovered in the  legendary Nara and Narayana.    [Footnote 23: It is obvious that this island lies in a latitude  somewhere between that of Lilliput and Brobdingnag, and that the  professors who have endeavoured to locate it on the map of Asia have  wasted their time.]    Comparing then the Bhagavad-gita with the Narayaniya, we see that in  all essentials they agree, but in two points they differ. Both preach  a doctrine of activity in pious works, _pravritti_, in conscious  opposition to the inactivity of the Aupanishadas and Samkhyas; but  the Narayaniya does not dwell much on this topic, and limits activity  to strictly religious duties, while the Bhagavad-gita develops the  idea so as to include everything, thus sketching out a bold system for  the sanctification of all sides of life, which enables it to open the  door of salvation directly to all classes of mankind. Secondly, the  Bhagavad-gita says nothing about the theory of emanations or _vyuhas_  in connection with Vasudeva; probably its author knew the legends of  Samkarshana, Pradyumna, and Aniruddha, but he apparently did not know  or at least did not accept the view that these persons were related as  successive emanations from Vasudeva. We must therefore look round for  sidelights which may clear up the obscurities in the history of this  church.    Our first sidelight glimmers in the famous grammar of Panini, who  probably lived in the fifth century B.C., or perhaps early in the  fourth century. Panini informs us (IV. iii. 98) that from the names of  Vasudeva and Arjuna the derivative nouns _Vasudevaka_ and _Arjunaka_  are formed to denote persons who worship respectively Vasudeva and  Arjuna. Plainly then in the fifth century Krishna Vasudeva and Arjuna  were worshipped by some, probably in the same connection as is shown  in the Mahabharata. Perhaps Vasudeva had not yet been raised to the  rank of the Almighty; it is more likely that he was still a deified  hero and teacher, and Arjuna his noblest disciple. But both of them  were receiving divine honours; they had been men, and were now gods,  with bands of adorers.    Our next evidence is an inscription found not long ago on the base of  a stone column at Besnagar near Bhilsa, in the south of Gwalior  State,[24] and must have been engraved soon after 200 B.C. It reads as  follows: \"This Garuda-column of Vasudeva the god of gods was erected  here by Heliodorus, a worshipper of the Lord [_bhagavata_], the son of  Diya [Greek _Dion_] and an inhabitant of Taxila, who came as  ambassador of the Greeks from the Great King Amtalikita [Greek  _Antialcidas_] to King Kasiputra Bhagabhadra the Saviour, who was  flourishing in the fourteenth year of his reign\"; and below this are  two lines in some kind of verse, which announce that \"three immortal  steps ... when practised lead to heaven--self-control, charity, and  diligence.\" Here, then, in the centre of a thriving kingdom probably  forming part of the Sunga empire, Vasudeva is worshipped not as a  minor hero or teacher, but as the god of gods, _deva-deva_; and he is  worshipped by the Greek Heliodorus, visiting the place as an  ambassador from Antialcidas, a Hellenic king of the lineage of  Eucratides, who was reigning in the North-West of India. Doubtless the  act of Heliodorus was a diplomatic courtesy, in order to please King  Kasiputra Bhagabhadra. But observe the nature of his act. He caused to  be erected a Garuda-column, that is, a pillar engraved with the figure  of Garuda, the sacred bird of Vishnu; and he added a verse about  \"three immortal steps\" (_trini amutapadani_), as leading to heaven,  which sounds suspiciously like an attempt to moralise the old mythical  feature of the three Steps of Vishnu. Plainly Vasudeva had now risen  in this part of the country from being the teacher of a church of  Vishnu-Narayana to the rank of its chief god, with which he had become  fully identified.    [Footnote 24: See Rapson, _Ancient India_, p. 156 ff., _Cambridge  Hist. India_, i, pp. 521, 558, 625, H. Ray Chaudhuri, _Materials for  the Study of the Early History of the Vaishnava Sect_, p. 59, and  Ramaprasad Chanda, _Archaeology and Vaishnava Tradition_ in _Memoirs of  the Archaeological Survey of India_, No. 5, p. 151 ff., etc.]    Another inscription, a few years later in date, has been found in  Besnagar. It is a mere fragment, but it supplements the other; for it  states that a certain _bhagavata_, or \"worshipper of the Lord,\" named  Gotama-puta (Gautama-putra in Sanskrit) erected a Garuda-column for  the Lord's temple in the twelfth year from the coronation of King  Bhagavata. This king is perhaps the same as the person of that name  who appears in some genealogical lists as the last but one of the  Sunga Kings.[25]    [Footnote 25: See R. Chanda, _ut supra_, p. 152 f.]    Next in date is an inscription on a stone slab found at Ghasundi,  about four miles north-east of Nagari, in Udaipur State. It was  engraved about 150 B.C., and records that a certain _bhagavata_, or  \"worshipper of the Lord,\" named Gajayana, son of Parasari, caused to  be erected in the Narayana-vata, or park of Narayana, a stone chapel  for the worship of the Lords Samkarshana and Vasudeva.[26] Here their  worship is associated with that of Narayana.    [Footnote 26: It is noteworthy that Samkarshana is here mentioned  first, as is also the case in the Nanaghat inscription of about 100  B.C., which mentions them as descendants of the Moon in a list of  various deities. This order may possibly be due to the fact that in  ancient legend Samkarshana, or Bala-bhadra, is the elder brother of  Krishna Vasudeva, and it does not entitle us to draw the inference  that he ever received equal honour with Vasudeva. Special devotees of  Samkarshana are mentioned in the Kautiliya, the famous treatise on  polity ascribed to Chanakya, the minister of Chandra-gupta Maurya, who  came to the throne about 320 B.C. (Engl. transl. 1st edn., p. 485). I  suspect that in its present form the Kautiliya is considerably later  than 320 B.C.; but in any case the existence of special votaries of  Samkarshana is no proof that he ever ranked as equal to Vasudeva, just  as the presence of special worshippers of Arjuna is no proof that  Arjuna was ever considered a peer of Vasudeva. On the Ghasundi  inscription see R. Chanda, _ut supra_, p. 163 ff., etc.; for the  Nanaghat inscription, _ibidem_ and _Memoirs of the Arch. Survey of  India_, No. 1, with H. Raychaudhuri's _Materials, etc._, p. 68 ff.]    Passing over an inscription at Mathura which records the building of a  part of a sanctuary to the Lord Vasudeva about 15 B.C. by the great  Satrap Sodasa,[27] we note that the grammarian Patanjali, who wrote his  commentary the Mahabhashya upon Panini's grammar about 150 B.C., has  something to say about Krishna Vasudeva, whom he recognises as a divine  being (on IV. iii. 98). He quotes some verses referring to him. The  first (on II. ii. 23) is to the"]]]
