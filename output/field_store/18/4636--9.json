[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#12)"],[1,"  dictionary might be made of the words that occur only in the prose. Most  of these words would be found to derive from the Saxon stock, which  yields him almost all his store of invective and vituperation. The  resources of his Latinised vocabulary enable him to rise by successive  gyrations to a point of vantage above his prey, and then the downward  rush that strikes the quarry is a Saxon monosyllable. In this cardinal  point of art for those who have to do with the English speech he became  the teacher of Burke, who, with a lesser wealth of Saxon at his command,  employed it with a more telling parsimony.    Milton avoids no word of humble origin, so it serve his purpose. His  contempt finds voice in such expressions as to \"huddle\" prayers, and to  \"keck\" at wholesome food. Gehazi \"rooks\" from Naaman; the bishops \"prog  and pander for fees,\" and are \"the common stales to countenance every  politic fetch that was then on foot.\" The Presbyterians were earnest  enough \"while pluralities greased them thick and deep\"; the gentlemen who  accompanied King Charles in his assault on the privileges of the House of  Commons were \"the spawn and shipwreck of taverns and dicing-houses.\" The  people take their religion from their minister \"by scraps and mammocks,  as he dispenses it in his Sunday's dole\"; and \"the superstitious man by  his good will is an atheist, but being scared from thence by the pangs  and gripes of a boiling conscience, all in a pudder shuffles up to  himself such a God and such a worship as is most agreeable to remedy his  fear.\"    There were few incidents in Milton's career, from his personal relations  with his college tutor to his choice of blank verse for his epic, that he  was not called upon at some time or other in his life to explain and  defend. When his free use of homely figures and turns of speech was  objected to him, his answer was ready: \"Doth not Christ Himself teach the  highest things by the similitude of old bottles and patched clothes? Doth  He not illustrate best things by things most evil? His own coming to be  as a thief in the night, and the righteous man's wisdom to that of an  unjust steward?\" But the defence is misleading, for the rules that  governed Milton's usage are not what it would suggest. When he came to  treat of the best and highest things his use of native English became  more sparing and dainty, while the rank, strong words that smack of the  home soil were all foregone.    His prose works, therefore, help us to appreciate better the tribulations  of the process whereby he became a classic poet. Eclecticism and the  severe castigation of style are dangerous disciplines for any but a rich  temperament; from others they produce only what is exquisite and thin and  vapid. The \"stylist\" of the modern world is generally an interesting  invalid; his complexion would lose all its transparency if it were  exposed to the weather; his weak voice would never make itself heard in  the hubbub of the bazaar. Sunbeams cannot be extracted from cucumbers,  nor can the great manner in literature emanate from a chill self-culture.  But Milton inherited the fulness and vigour of the Elizabethans, and so  could afford to write an epic poem in a selection of the language really  used by men. The grandeur of _Paradise Lost_ or _Samson Agonistes_ could  never, by any conceivable device of chemistry or magic, be compounded  from delicate sensibilities and a superfine ear for music. For the  material of those palaces whole provinces were pillaged, and the waste  might furnish forth a city.          CHAPTER III  PARADISE LOST: THE SCHEME      A prerogative place among the great epics of the world has sometimes been  claimed for _Paradise Lost_, on the ground that the theme it handles is  vaster and of a more universal human interest than any handled by  Milton's predecessors. It concerns itself with the fortunes, not of a  city or an empire, but of the whole human race, and with that particular  event in the history of the race which has moulded all its destinies.  Around this event, the plucking of an apple, are ranged, according to the  strictest rules of the ancient epic, the histories of Heaven and Earth  and Hell. The scene of the action is Universal Space. The time  represented is Eternity. The characters are God and all his Creatures.  And all these are exhibited in the clearest and most inevitable relation  with the main event, so that there is not an incident, hardly a line of  the poem, but leads backwards or forwards to those central lines in the  Ninth Book:--        So saying, her rash hand in evil hour    Forth-reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat.    Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat,    Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe    That all was lost.    From this point radiates a plot so immense in scope, that the history of  the world from the first preaching of the Gospel to the Millennium  occupies only some fifty lines of Milton's epilogue. And if the plot be  vast, the stage is large enough to set it forth. The size of Milton's  theatre gives to his imagination those colossal scenical opportunities  which are turned to such magnificent account. De Quincey enumerates some  of them--\"Heaven opening to eject her rebellious children; the  unvoyageable depths of ancient Chaos, with its 'anarch old' and its  eternal war of wrecks; these traversed by that great leading Angel that  drew after him the third part of the heavenly host; earliest Paradise  dawning upon the warrior-angel out of this far-distant 'sea without  shore' of chaos; the dreadful phantoms of Sin and Death, prompted by  secret sympathy and snuffing the distant scent of 'mortal change on  earth,' chasing the steps of their great progenitor and sultan; finally  the heart-freezing visions, shown and narrated to Adam, of human misery  through vast successions of shadowy generations: all these scenical  opportunities offered in the _Paradise Lost_ become in the hands of the  mighty artist elements of undying grandeur not matched on earth.\"    All these grandeurs and beauties are as real and living to-day as they  were on the day when Milton conceived them. But the other advantage  claimed for his epic, that it deals with matters of the dearest concern  to all of us, has been sharply questioned. It was Mr. Pattison's  complaint of _Paradise Lost_ that in it \"Milton has taken a scheme of  life for life itself,\" and that it requires a violent effort from the  modern reader to accommodate his conceptions to the anthropomorphic  theology of the poem. The world is now thickly peopled with men and women  who, having bestowed their patronage on other ancestors, care little  about Adam and Eve, and who therefore feel that Milton's poem is wanting  in the note of actuality. Satan himself is not what he used to be; he is  doubly fallen, in the esteem of his victims as well as of his Maker, and  indeed      Comes to the place where he before had sat    Among the prime in splendour, now deposed,    Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned,    A spectacle of ruin.    \"He who aspires,\" says Mr. Pattison, \"to be the poet of a nation is bound  to adopt a hero who is already dear to that people.\" But how if the hero  subsequently fall out of vogue, and his name lose its power with a fickle  populace? Can even a poet save him?    The drifting away of the popular belief from the tenets of Milton's  theology doubtless does something to explain the lukewarm interest taken  by most educated English readers in _Paradise Lost_. But it is a mistake  to make much of this explanation. Certainly Milton held his own  theological beliefs, as expounded in the poem, in perfect good faith and  with great tenacity. But the generation after his own, which first gave  him his great fame, was not seduced into admiration by any whole-hearted  fellowship in belief. Dryden laments the presence in the poem of so many  \"machining persons,\"--as he calls the supernatural characters of  _Paradise Lost_. At almost the same date Dr. Thomas Burnet was causing a  mild sensation in the theological world by expounding the earlier  chapters of the Book of Genesis in an allegorical sense, and denying to  them the significance of a literal history. Voltaire, while he praises  Milton, remarks that the topic of _Paradise Lost_ has afforded nothing  among the French but some lively lampoons, and that those who have the  highest respect for the mysteries of the Christian religion cannot  forbear now and then making free with the devil, the serpent, the frailty  of our first parents, and the rib that was stolen from Adam. \"I have  often admired,\" he goes on, \"how barren the subject appears, and how  fruitful it grows under his hands.\"    It seems likely that Milton himself, before he was fairly caught in the  mesh of his own imagination, was well aware that his subject demanded  something of the nature of a _tour de force_. He had to give physical,  geometric embodiment to a far-reaching scheme of abstract speculation and  thought,--parts of it very reluctant to such a treatment. The necessities  of the epic form constrained him. When Satan, on the top of Mount  Niphates, exclaims--      Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell;    when Michael promises to Adam, after his expulsion from the garden--      A Paradise within thee; happier far;    Milton must have known as well as any of his critics that this conception  of Hell and of Paradise, if insisted on, would have shattered the fabric  of his poem. His figures of Sin and Death were of his own invention, and  we must not suppose him so obtuse as never to have realised the part that  his shaping imagination bore in the presentment of other and greater  figures in the poem. In some respects he tried rather to impose a scheme  of thought and imagination upon his age than to express the ideas that he  found current.

He's a nice lad, not  brilliant, but very painstaking over his work. It's quite a pleasure  to teach him.\"          CHAPTER VIII    Gwen Receives a Letter      After her talk with Father on the evening of the prize-giving Gwen  went back to school determined, if she could not feel cordial just at  present towards her classmates, she would at least bury the hatchet  and take no notice of the unkindness they had exhibited. It seemed  much the most dignified course, for Gwen was far too proud to look  injured, or to show even to Netta that she had felt hurt. Perhaps the  girls were a little ashamed of themselves. Iris Watson and one or two  others spoke to her with quite an approach to friendliness, and  Elspeth Frazer asked her opinion about the costumes for the play. Gwen  was not taking a part, so she was rather a free lance in that respect,  and her advice was likely to be disinterested. Each Form got up its  own particular act with a secrecy worthy of the Freemasons. It was a  point of honour not to betray the least tiny hint of what was going to  happen, in order that the performance should be a complete surprise to  the rest of the school.    Now the Fifth had decided to give the trial scene from the _Merchant  of Venice_--rather an ambitious and decidedly a hackneyed piece to  select. The Dramatic Society was influenced in its choice, however,  by several considerations; the Form was studying _The Merchant_, and  had learnt the principal speeches for recitations, which would save a  great deal of trouble to the performers in the matter of studying  parts. Then Hilda Browne's father was a barrister and would lend his  wig for the occasion, and Louise Mawson could bring a gown that would  do excellently for Shylock's gaberdine, also two sets of tights and  doublets and feathered caps, all of which were invaluable assets in  the way of stage properties.    \"We must manage the rest of the costumes as best we can,\" said  Elspeth. \"Charlotte Perry knows of a dressmaker who makes fancy  dresses very cheaply. She does them for other schools. The chief  question is the scheme of colour: Hilda wants us to copy exactly from  some celebrated picture, and Louise says it doesn't matter as long as  everything looks very bright and gay. Here's a book of costumes. Tell  me what you think.\"    As Gwen turned over the pages of the little volume, with its  illustrations of Bassanio, Jessica, &c., a horrible suspicion suddenly  shot into her mind. Where had she seen that book before? And just  lately too! Why, at home, of course! She had come into the  sitting-room suddenly and found Winnie and Beatrice discussing it over  the fire. Winnie had suppressed it instantly, but not before she had  caught a glimpse both of the illustrations and the title. She  remembered them perfectly. Now Winnie, as well as being Junior  Mistress for the Fifth, was a member of a class for higher mathematics  composed of a few Senior girls and taught by a professor who came  weekly from the University at Radchester. On the strength of this  class she considered herself still one of the Sixth for special  purposes, and licensed to take part in school performances. Was the  Sixth going to act in the _Merchant of Venice_? It looked uncommonly  like it. Why else should Winnie be studying that particular book of  costumes?    Gwen was in a dilemma. She did not know what to do. Not only did the  Rodenhurst code of honour regard Form secrets as being inviolable as  those of the confessional, but further she had been continually warned  by Father and Beatrice that, now Winnie was a mistress, she and Lesbia  must be particularly careful never to repeat anything they heard at  home which might be likely to compromise their sister at school. It  was clearly impossible to betray the least hint of her suspicion, but  on the other hand it would be an exceedingly stupid _denouement_ if  both Forms were to act the same play. She decided to try finesse.    \"Have you absolutely decided on _The Merchant_?\" she said. \"Don't you  think it's rather stale to choose our Form subject? It's been done  before too.\"    \"Not for three years,\" objected Elspeth. \"That's quite time enough for  most of the girls to have forgotten it. Besides, I know the speeches.\"    \"You could learn some fresh ones.\"    \"Oh, I dare say! It sounds easy enough when you haven't to do it  yourself. One's homework is quite enough just now without learning  pages of blank verse. Then there are the costumes.\"    \"Wouldn't they come in for _The Rivals_? You might do some scenes from  that. We've never had it at school before, and it's simply ripping.  Or part of _She Stoops to Conquer_ would be gorgeously funny.\"    \"You couldn't put Sir Anthony Absolute into Shylock's gaberdine, or  Tony Lumpkin into a Venetian doublet and tights! And what about the  wig? Hilda's had hard work to persuade her father to lend it, and  she'd be fearfully offended if it wasn't used.\"    These arguments were so conclusive that Gwen sighed. Nevertheless she  made a last appeal.    \"Well, I think you're very silly to act _The Merchant_,\" she said.  \"You might choose something far more original and interesting. It's an  opportunity wasted--and, if you'll only believe me, I'm quite sure  you'll be sorry for it.\"    \"It's you that's silly, Gwen Gascoyne!\" retorted the indignant  Elspeth. \"We've chosen _The Merchant_, so why need you go trying to  upset everything. I was asking you about the costumes, not the play.\"    \"Like Gwen's cheek!\" murmured Louise Mawson. \"We don't want ex-Juniors  interfering with our Dramatic!\"    Gwen turned sharply away. It seemed most unfortunate that she always  got across the rest of the Form. In this instance her motive was the  purest, but as she could not explain, the girls naturally thought it  was only her love of putting herself forward which caused her to  suggest such a drastic measure as a change of programme.    \"They never will understand me!\" she thought bitterly. \"Father said  they would be proud of me yet, but oh, dear! the more I try to do, the  more I seem disliked. They'll be fearfully sold when it comes to the  performance. I wonder if I ought to give them just a hint! It's really  too idiotic to have two _Merchants_. No, I won't! They'd probably only  slang me for letting out Form secrets. I'm glad I'm not acting, at any  rate. School's not exactly a terrestrial paradise at present. I wonder  what other troubles are coming to me? I believe I'm one of those  people who are born under an unlucky star!\"    Gwen's words might almost have been prophetic, for the very next day  something happened--something so unprecedented and overwhelming that  she could never have anticipated it, even if she had been expecting  general ill luck.    At the interval she received a summons to Miss Roscoe's study. She  went at once, wondering why she had been sent for.    \"Hope the Head's not going to put me into the Sixth!\" she laughed to  herself. \"That would be rather too good a joke. I'm willing to be a  prefect or even proctor if I'm asked!\"    Gwen's reception at her last visit to the study had been so  favourable, that this time she tapped lightly at the door, and entered  confidently. One glance at Miss Roscoe's face, however, showed her  that she was in dire disgrace. The Principal's rather handsome, heavy  features seemed to cast themselves in a Roman mould when she was  annoyed; her brows would knit, and her mouth assume a set, dogged  expression of authority. All these storm signals being visible, Gwen  quaked in her shoes. Miss Roscoe had an unopened envelope in her  hand, and to this at once drew her pupil's attention.    \"Gwen Gascoyne, a letter arrived this morning addressed to you at  Rodenhurst. Now, it is one of our principal rules that no girls are  allowed to have letters sent to them at the school. Tell your  correspondent on no account to write to you here again. If I find  anything further addressed to you, I shall enclose it in an envelope,  and post it to your father. I will not have Rodenhurst made a vehicle  for clandestine correspondence. You may go, but understand clearly  this is never to happen again.\"    Gwen took the letter, and left the room in silence. She was too much  astonished to defend herself. She could not imagine who had written to  her and put the school address. As soon as she was in the corridor she  tore open the envelope. It contained a bill from \"Messrs. John Parker  & Sons, Glass and China Merchants\" for           \"Replacing 10 articles in broken            Tea Service ...            L1  2  6\"    And at the bottom was written in a business hand:--         \"Messrs. Parker beg respectfully to request Miss Gascoyne's       settlement of above. Should she prefer it, they will send       the account to her father. They beg to assure her of their       best attention at all times.\"    Gwen gasped.    \"Why, I paid it!\" she said almost aloud. \"At least, I sent the money  by Emma. Is it possible she can have pocketed it? Oh, the deceiving  wretch! Where's Netta? I must tell her at once!\"    She rushed into the gymnasium, and calling Netta aside, showed her the  fatal document. The two talked it over, aghast.    \"Whew! This is a bad job!\" exclaimed Netta. \"Certainly it looks as if  Emma had decamped with the one pound two and six. She's left the  school, you know.\"    \"I didn't know,\" sighed Gwen.    \"Yes, she went ten days ago. Haven't you noticed there's a new  housemaid waiting at dinner? You must be as blind as a bat!\"    \"I'm afraid I am done for,\" said Gwen dramatically.    \"Oh, I shouldn't give up too soon if I were you! I suppose, by the by,  you wouldn't care to tell your father?\"    \"I'd rather die!\"    \"Then you'll have to go somehow to Parker's, and ask if they've made a  mistake. If, as I strongly suspect, Emma really didn't pay it, then  you might get them to take part on account now, and leave the rest  till after Christmas. What"]]]
