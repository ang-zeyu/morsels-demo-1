Robert wrote me he  saw him on his way through Charlottesville with his squadron, and that  he was well. While at Fernandina I went over to Cumberland Island and  walked up to 'Dungeness,' the former residence of General Green. It was  my first visit to the house, and I had the gratification at length of  visiting my father's grave. He died there, you may recollect, on his  way from the West Indies, and was interred in one corner of the family  cemetery. The spot is marked by a plain marble slab, with his name, age,  and her daughter, Mrs. Shaw, and her husband. The place is at present  owned by Mr. Nightingale, nephew of Mrs. Shaw, who married a daughter  of Mr. James King. The family have moved into the interior of Georgia,  leaving only a few servants and a white gardener on the place. The  garden was beautiful, inclosed by the finest hedge I have ever seen. It  was of the wild olive, which, in Mrs. Shaw's lifetime, during my tour of  duty in Savannah in early life, was so productive, had been destroyed  by an insect that has proved fatal to the orange on the coast of Georgia  and Florida. There was a fine grove of olives, from which, I learn, Mr.  Nightingale procures oil. The garden was filled with roses and beautiful  vines, the names of which I do not know. Among them was the tomato-vine  in full bearing, with the ripe fruit on it. There has yet been no frost  in that region of country this winter. I went in the dining-room and  parlour, in which the furniture still remained.... The house has never  been finished, but is a fine, large one and beautifully located. A  magnificent grove of live-oaks envelops the road from the landing to the  house.... Love to everybody and God bless you all.    \"Truly and faithfully yours,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    From the same place there is another letter to my mother:    \"Coosawhatchie, South Carolina, January 28, 1862.    \"I have just returned from Charleston, and received your letter of the  14th, dear Mary.... I was called to Charleston by the appearance off the  bar of a fleet of vessels the true character and intent of which could  not be discerned during the continuance of the storm which obscured the  view. Saturday, however, all doubt was dispelled, and from the beach on  Sullivan's Island the preparations for sinking them were plainly seen.  Twenty-one were visible the first day of my arrival, but at the end  of the storm, Saturday, only seventeen were seen. Five of these were  vessels of war: what became of the other four is not known. The twelve  old merchantmen were being stripped of their spars, masts, etc., and by  sunset seven were prepared apparently for sinking across the mouth of  the Maffitt Channel, they were placed in a line about two hundred yards  apart, about four miles from Fort Moultrie. They will do but little harm  to the channel, I think, but may deter vessels from running out at  night for fear of getting on them. There now seem to be indications of a  movement against Savannah. The enemy's gunboats are pushing up the creek  to cut off communication between the city and Fort Pulaski on Cockspur  Island. Unless I have better news, I must go there to-day. There are so  many points of attack, and so little means to meet them on the water,  that there is but little rest.... Perry and Meredith are well and send  regards to everybody....    \"Very truly and sincerely yours,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    It was most important that the defenses of Charleston and Savannah  should be made as strong as possible. The difficulties in the way were  many and great, but General Lee's perseverance overcame most of them.  The result was that neither of those cities fell till the close of the  war, and a region of country was preserved to the Confederacy  necessary for the feeding of its armies. Of course all of this was not  accomplished by my father alone in the four months he was there; but the  plans of defense he laid down were successfully followed.    While in Savannah, he writes to my mother:    \"Savannah, February 8, 1862.    \"I wrote to you, dear Mary, the day I left Coosawhatchie for this place.  I have been here ever since, endeavouring to push forward the work for  the defense of the city, which has lagged terribly and which ought to  have been finished. But it is difficult to arouse ourselves from ease  and comfort to labour and self-denial.    \"Guns are scarce, as well as ammunition, and I shall have to break up  batteries on the coast to provide, I fear, for this city. Our enemies  are endeavouring to work their way through the creeks that traverse  the impassable marshes stretching along the interior of the coast and  communicating with the sounds and sea, through which the Savannah flows,  and thus avoid the entrance of the river commanded by Fort Pulaski.  Their boats require only seven feet of water to float them, and the tide  rises seven feet, so that at high water they can work their way and rest  on the mud at low. They are also provided with dredges and appliances  for removing obstructions through the creeks in question, which cannot  be guarded by batteries. I hope, however, we shall be able to stop them,  and I daily pray to the Giver of all victories to enable us to do so....  I trust you are all well and doing well, and wish I could do anything to  promote either. I have more here than I can do, and more, I fear, than I  can well accomplish. It is so very hard to get anything done, and while  all wish well and mean well, it is so different to get them to act  energetically and promptly.... The news from Kentucky and Tennessee is  not favourable, but we must make up our minds to meet with reverses and  overcome them. I hope God will at last crown our efforts with success.  But the contest must be long and severe, and the whole country has to go  through much suffering. It is necessary we should be humbled and taught  to be less boastful, less selfish, and more devoted to right and justice  to all the world.... Always yours,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    To my mother:    \"Savannah, February 23, 1862.    \"I have been wishing, dear Mary, to write to you for more than a week,  but every day and every hour seem so taken up that I have found it  impossible.... The news from Tennessee and North Carolina is not all  cheering, and disasters seem to be thickening around us. It calls for  renewed energies and redoubled strength on our part, and, I hope, will  produce it. I fear our soldiers have not realised the necessity for the  endurance and labour they are called upon to undergo, and that it is  better to sacrifice themselves than our cause. God, I hope, will shield  us and give us success. Here the enemy is progressing slowly in his  designs, and does not seem prepared, or to have determined when or  where to make his attack. His gunboats are pushing up all the creeks and  marshes of the Savannah, and have attained a position so near the river  as to shell the steamers navigating it. None have as yet been struck. I  am engaged in constructing a line of defense at Fort Jackson which, if  time permits and guns can be obtained, I hope will keep them out. They  can bring such overwhelming force in all their movements that it has the  effect to demoralise our new troops. The accounts given in the papers of  the quantity of cotton shipped to New York are, of course, exaggerated.  It is cotton in the seed and dirt, and has to be ginned and cleaned  after its arrival. It is said that the negroes are employed in picking  and collecting it, and are paid a certain amount. But all these things  are gathered from rumour, and can only be believed as they appear  probable, which this seems to be.... I went yesterday to church, being  the day appointed for fasting and prayer. I wish I could have passed it  more devoutly. The bishop (Elliott) gave a most beautiful prayer for the  President, which I hope may be heard and answered.... Here the yellow  jasmine, red-bud, orange-tree, etc., perfume the whole woods, and the  japonicas and azaleas cover the garden. Perry and Meredith are well. May  God bless and keep you always is the constant prayer of your husband,    \"R. E. Lee.\"    To his daughter Annie:    \"Savannah, March 2, 1862.    \"My Precious Annie: It has been a long time since I have written to  you, but you have been constantly in my thoughts. I think of you all,  separately and collectively, in the busy hours of the day and the silent  hours of the night, and the recollection of each and every one whiles  away the long night, in which my anxious thoughts drive away sleep. But  I always feel that you and Agnes at those times are sound asleep, and  that is immaterial to either where the blockaders are or what their  progress is in the river. I hope you are all well, and as happy as  you can be in these perilous times to our country. They look dark at  present, and it is plain we have not suffered enough, laboured enough,  repented enough, to deserve success. But they will brighten after  awhile, and I trust that a merciful God will arouse us to a sense of our  danger, bless our honest efforts, and drive back our enemies to their  homes. Our people have not been earnest enough, have thought too much  of themselves and their ease, and instead of turning out to a man,  have been content to nurse themselves and their dimes, and leave the  protection of themselves and families to others. To satisfy their  consciences, they have been clamorous in criticising what others have  done, and endeavoured to prove that they ought to do nothing. This is  not the way to accomplish our independence. I have been doing all I can  with our small means and slow workmen to defend the cities and coast  here. Against ordinary numbers we are pretty strong, but against the  hosts our enemies seem able to bring everywhere there is no calculating.  But if our men will stand to their work, we shall give them trouble and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23245"],[0,"Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan (#12)"],[1," these words, and doubly grieved        At what his hands had done,      The monarch wept, as weeps bereaved        A man his only son.        \"Nay, weep not so,\" resumed the child,        \"But rather let me say      My own sad story, sin-defiled.        And why I die to day!        \"Picking a living in our sheaves,        And happy in their loves,      Near, 'mid a peepul's quivering leaves,        There lived a pair of doves.        \"Never were they two separate,        And lo, in idle mood,      I took a sling and ball, elate        In wicked sport and rude,--        \"And killed one bird,--it was the male,        Oh cruel deed and base!      The female gave a plaintive wail        And looked me in the face!        \"The wail and sad reproachful look        In plain words seemed to say,      A widowed life I cannot brook,        The forfeit thou must pay.        \"What was my darling's crime that thou        Him wantonly shouldst kill?      The curse of blood is on thee now,        Blood calls for red blood still.        \"And so I die--a bloody death--        But not for this I mourn,      To feel the world pass with my breath        I gladly could have borne,        \"But for my parents, who are blind,        And have no other stay,--      This, this, weighs sore upon my mind        And fills me with dismay.        \"Upon the eleventh day of the moon        They keep a rigorous fast,      All yesterday they fasted; soon        For water and repast        \"They shall upon me feebly call!        Ah, must they call in vain?      Bear thou the pitcher, friend--'tis all        I ask--down that steep lane.\"        He pointed,--ceased,--then sudden died!        The king took up the corpse,      And with the pitcher slowly hied,        Attended by Remorse,        Down the steep lane--unto the hut        Girt round with _Bela_ trees;      Gleamed far a light-the door not shut        Was open to the breeze.      PART III.        \"Oh why does not our child return?        Too long he surely stays.\"--      Thus to the _Muni_, blind and stern,        His partner gently says.        \"For fruits and water when he goes        He never stays so long,      Oh can it be, beset by foes,        He suffers cruel wrong?        \"Some distance he has gone, I fear,        A more circuitous round,--      Yet why should he? The fruits are near,        The river near our bound.        \"I die of thirst,--it matters not        If Sindhu be but safe,      What if he leave us, and this spot,        Poor birds in cages chafe.        \"Peevish and fretful oft we are,--        Ah, no--that cannot be:      Of our blind eyes he is the star,        Without him, what were we?        \"Too much he loves us to forsake,        But something ominous,      Here in my heart, a dreadful ache,        Says, he is gone from us.        \"Why do my bowels for him yearn,        What ill has crossed his path?      Blind, helpless, whither shall we turn,        Or how avert the wrath?        \"Lord of my soul--what means my pain?        This horrid terror,--like      Some cloud that hides a hurricane;        Hang not, O lightning,--strike!\"        Thus while she spake, the king drew near        With haggard look and wild,      Weighed down with grief, and pale with fear,        Bearing the lifeless child.        Rustled the dry leaves neath his foot,        And made an eerie sound,      A neighbouring owl began to hoot,        All else was still around.        At the first rustle of the leaves        The _Muni_ answered clear,      \"Lo, here he is--oh wherefore grieves        Thy soul, my partner dear?\"        The words distinct, the monarch heard,        He could no further go,      His nature to its depths was stirred,        He stopped in speechless woe.        No steps advanced,--the sudden pause        Attention quickly drew,      Rolled sightless orbs to learn the cause,        But, hark!--the steps renew.        \"Where art thou, darling--why so long        Hast thou delayed to-night?      We die of thirst,--we are not strong,        This fasting kills outright.        \"Speak to us, dear one,--only speak,        And calm our idle fears,      Where hast thou been, and what to seek?        Have pity on these tears.\"        With head bent low the monarch heard,        Then came a cruel throb      That tore his heart,--still not a word,        Only a stifled sob!        \"It is not Sindhu--who art thou?        And where is Sindhu gone?      There's blood upon thy hands--avow!\"        \"There is.\"--\"Speak on, speak on.\"        The dead child in their arms he placed,        And briefly told his tale,      The parents their dead child embraced,        And kissed his forehead pale.        \"Our hearts are broken. Come, dear wife,        On earth no more we dwell;      Now welcome Death, and farewell Life,        And thou, O king, farewell!        \"We do not curse thee, God forbid        But to my inner eye      The future is no longer hid,        Thou too shalt like us die.        \"Die--for a son's untimely loss!        Die--with a broken heart!      Now help us to our bed of moss,        And let us both depart.\"        Upon the moss he laid them down,        And watched beside the bed;      Death gently came and placed a crown        Upon each reverend head.        Where the Sarayu's waves dash free        Against a rocky bank,      The monarch had the corpses three        Conveyed by men of rank;        There honoured he with royal pomp        Their funeral obsequies,--      Incense and sandal, drum and tromp,        And solemn sacrifice.        What is the sequel of the tale?        How died the king?--Oh man,      A prophet's words can never fail--        Go, read the Ramayan.          VIII.    PREHLAD.          A terror both of gods and men      Was Heerun Kasyapu, the king;      No bear more sullen in its den,      No tiger quicker at the spring.      In strength of limb he had not met,      Since first his black flag he unfurled,      Nor in audacious courage, yet,      His equal in the wide, wide world.        The holy Veds he tore in shreds;      Libations, sacrifices, rites,      He made all penal; and the heads      Of Bramins slain, he flung to kites,      \"I hold the sceptre in my hand,      I sit upon the ivory throne,      Bow down to me--'tis my command,      And worship me, and me alone.        \"No god has ever me withstood,      Why raise ye altars?--cease your pains!      I shall protect you, give you food,      If ye obey,--or else the chains.\"      Fled at such edicts, self-exiled,      The Bramins and the pundits wise,      To live thenceforth in forests wild,      Or caves in hills that touch the skies.        In secret there, they altars raised,      And made oblations due by fire,      Their gods, their wonted gods, they praised,      Lest these should earth destroy in ire;      They read the Veds, they prayed and mused,      Full well they knew that Time would bring      For favours scorned, and gifts misused,      Undreamt of changes on his wing.        Time changes deserts bare to meads,      And fertile meads to deserts bare,      Cities to pools, and pools with reeds      To towns and cities large and fair.      Time changes purple into rags,      And rags to purple. Chime by chime,      Whether it flies, or runs, or drags--      The wise wait patiently on Time.        Time brought the tyrant children four,      Rahd, Onoorahd, Prehlad, Sunghrad,      Who made his castle gray and hoar,      Once full of gloom, with sunshine glad.      No boys were e'er more beautiful,      No brothers e'er loved more each other,      No sons were e'er more dutiful,      Nor ever kissed a fonder mother.        Nor less beloved were they of him      Who gave them birth, Kasyapu proud,      But made by nature stern and grim,      His love was covered by a cloud      From which it rarely e'er emerged,      To gladden these sweet human flowers.      They grew apace, and now Time urged      The education of their powers.        Who should their teacher be? A man      Among the flatterers in the court      Was found, well-suited to the plan      The tyrant had devised. Report      Gave him a wisdom owned by few,      And certainly to trim his sail,      And veer his bark, none better knew,      Before a changing adverse gale.        And Sonda Marco,--such his name,--      Took home the four fair boys to teach      All knowledge that their years became,      Science, and war, and modes of speech,      But he was told, if death he feared,      Never to tell them of the soul,      Of vows, and prayers, and rites revered,      And of the gods who all control.        The sciences the boys were taught      They mastered with a quickness strange,      But Prehlad was the one for thought,      He soared above the lesson's range.      One day the tutor unseen heard      The boy discuss forbidden themes,      As if his inmost heart were stirred,      And he of truth from heaven had gleams.        \"O Prince, what mean'st thou?\" In his fright      The teacher thus in private said--      \"Talk on such subjects is not right,      Wouldst thou bring ruin on my head?      There are no gods except the king,      The ruler of the world is he!      Look up to him, and do not bring      Destruction by a speech too free.        \"Be wary for thy own sake, child,      If he should hear thee talking so,      Thou shalt for ever be exiled,      And I shall die, full well I know.      Worthy of worship, honour, praise,      Is thy great father. Things unseen,      What _are_ they?--Themes of poets' lays!      They _are_ not and have never been.\"        Smiling, the boy, with folded hands,      As sign of a submission meek,      Answered his tutor. \"Thy commands      Are ever precious. Do not seek      To lay upon me what I feel      Would be unrighteous. Let me hear      Those inner voices that reveal      Long vistas in another sphere.        \"The gods that rule the earth and sea,      Shall "]]]
