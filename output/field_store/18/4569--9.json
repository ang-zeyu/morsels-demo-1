I  don't know,' says my father, excited-like, 'don't disturb the boy. I  hope he didn't hear nothing.'    \"So, me knowing they were just outside, it made me bolder, and I  slipped out of bed across to my little window--giving on the  Close--but the dog he bored right down to the bottom of the bed--and I  looked out. First go off I couldn't see anything. Then right down in  the shadow under a buttress I made out what I shall always say was two  spots of red--a dull red it was--nothing like a lamp or a fire, but  just so as you could pick 'em out of the black shadow. I hadn't but  just sighted 'em when it seemed we wasn't the only people that had  been disturbed, because I see a window in a house on the left-hand  side become lighted up, and the light moving. I just turned my head to  make sure of it, and then looked back into the shadow for those two  red things, and they were gone, and for all I peered about and stared,  there was not a sign more of them. Then come my last fright that  night--something come against my bare leg--but that was all right:  that was my little dog had come out of bed, and prancing about, making  a great to-do, only holding his tongue, and me seeing he was quite in  spirits again, I took him back to bed and we slept the night out!    \"Next morning I made out to tell my mother I'd had the dog in my room,  and I was surprised, after all she'd said about it before, how quiet  she took it. 'Did you?' she says. 'Well, by good rights you ought to  go without your breakfast for doing such a thing behind my back: but I  don't know as there's any great harm done, only another time you ask  my permission, do you hear?' A bit after that I said something to my  father about having heard the cats again. '_Cats_,' he says, and he  looked over at my poor mother, and she coughed and he says, 'Oh! ah!  yes, cats. I believe I heard 'em myself.'    \"That was a funny morning altogether: nothing seemed to go right. The  organist he stopped in bed, and the minor Canon he forgot it was the  19th day and waited for the _Venite_; and after a bit the deputy he  set off playing the chant for evensong, which was a minor; and then  the Decani boys were laughing so much they couldn't sing, and when it  came to the anthem the solo boy he got took with the giggles, and made  out his nose was bleeding, and shoved the book at me what hadn't  practised the verse and wasn't much of a singer if I had known it.  Well, things was rougher, you see, fifty years ago, and I got a nip  from the counter-tenor behind me that I remembered.    \"So we got through somehow, and neither the men nor the boys weren't  by way of waiting to see whether the Canon in residence--Mr. Henslow  it was--would come to the vestries and fine 'em, but I don't believe  he did: for one thing I fancy he'd read the wrong lesson for the first  time in his life, and knew it. Anyhow Evans and me didn't find no  difficulty in slipping up the stairs as I told you, and when we got up  we laid ourselves down flat on our stomachs where we could just  stretch our heads out over the old tomb, and we hadn't but just done  so when we heard the verger that was then, first shutting the iron  porch-gates and locking the south-west door, and then the transept  door, so we knew there was something up, and they meant to keep the  public out for a bit.    \"Next thing was, the Dean and the Canon come in by their door on the  north, and then I see my father, and old Palmer, and a couple of their  best men, and Palmer stood a talking for a bit with the Dean in the  middle of the choir. He had a coil of rope and the men had crows. All  of 'em looked a bit nervous. So there they stood talking, and at last  I heard the Dean say, 'Well, I've no time to waste, Palmer. If you  think this'll satisfy Southminster people, I'll permit it to be done;  but I must say this, that never in the whole course of my life have I  heard such arrant nonsense from a practical man as I have from you.  Don't you agree with me, Henslow?' As far as I could hear Mr. Henslow  said something like 'Oh! well we're told, aren't we, Mr. Dean, not to  judge others?' and the Dean he gave a kind of sniff, and walked  straight up to the tomb, and took his stand behind it with his back to  the screen, and the others they come edging up rather gingerly.  Henslow, he stopped on the south side and scratched on his chin, he  did. Then the Dean spoke up: 'Palmer,' he says, 'which can you do  easiest, get the slab off the top, or shift one of the side slabs?'    \"Old Palmer and his men they pottered about a bit looking round the  edge of the top slab and sounding the sides on the south and east and  west and everywhere but the north. Henslow said something about it  being better to have a try at the south side, because there was more  light and more room to move about in. Then my father, who'd been  watching of them, went round to the north side, and knelt down and  felt of the slab by the chink, and he got up and dusted his knees and  says to the Dean: 'Beg pardon, Mr. Dean, but I think if Mr. Palmer'll  try this here slab he'll find it'll come out easy enough. Seems to me  one of the men could prize it out with his crow by means of this  chink.' 'Ah! thank you, Worby,' says the Dean; 'that's a good  suggestion. Palmer, let one of your men do that, will you?'    \"So the man come round, and put his bar in and bore on it, and just  that minute when they were all bending over, and we boys got our heads  well out over the edge of the triforium, there come a most fearful  crash down at the west end of the choir, as if a whole stack of big  timber had fallen down a flight of stairs. Well, you can't expect me  to tell you everything that happened all in a minute. Of course there  was a terrible commotion. I heard the slab fall out, and the crowbar  on the floor, and I heard the Dean say 'Good God!'    \"When I looked down again I saw the Dean tumbled over on the floor,  the men was making off down the choir, Henslow was just going to help  the Dean up, Palmer was going to stop the men, as he said afterwards,  and my father was sitting on the altar step with his face in his  hands. The Dean he was very cross. 'I wish to goodness you'd look  where you're coming to, Henslow,' he says. 'Why you should all take  to your heels when a stick of wood tumbles down I cannot imagine,' and  all Henslow could do, explaining he was right away on the other side  of the tomb, would not satisfy him.    \"Then Palmer came back and reported there was nothing to account for  this noise and nothing seemingly fallen down, and when the Dean  finished feeling of himself they gathered round--except my father, he  sat where he was--and some one lighted up a bit of candle and they  looked into the tomb. 'Nothing there,' says the Dean, 'what did I tell  you? Stay! here's something. What's this: a bit of music paper, and a  piece of torn stuff--part of a dress it looks like. Both quite  modern--no interest whatever. Another time perhaps you'll take the  advice of an educated man'--or something like that, and off he went,  limping a bit, and out through the north door, only as he went he  called back angry to Palmer for leaving the door standing open. Palmer  called out 'Very sorry, sir,' but he shrugged his shoulders, and  Henslow says, 'I fancy Mr. Dean's mistaken. I closed the door behind  me, but he's a little upset.' Then Palmer says, 'Why, where's Worby?'  and they saw him sitting on the step and went up to him. He was  recovering himself, it seemed, and wiping his forehead, and Palmer  helped him up on to his legs, as I was glad to see.    \"They were too far off for me to hear what they said, but my father  pointed to the north door in the aisle, and Palmer and Henslow both of  them looked very surprised and scared. After a bit, my father and  Henslow went out of the church, and the others made what haste they  could to put the slab back and plaster it in. And about as the clock  struck twelve the Cathedral was opened again and us boys made the best  of our way home.    \"I was in a great taking to know what it was had given my poor father  such a turn, and when I got in and found him sitting in his chair  taking a glass of spirits, and my mother standing looking anxious at  him, I couldn't keep from bursting out and making confession where I'd  been. But he didn't seem to take on, not in the way of losing his  temper. 'You was there, was you? Well did you see it?' 'I see  everything, father,' I said, 'except when the noise came.' 'Did you  see what it was knocked the Dean over?' he says, 'that what come out  of the monument? You didn't? Well, that's a mercy.' 'Why, what was it,  father?' I said. 'Come, you must have seen it,' he says. '_Didn't_  you see? A thing like a man, all over hair, and two great eyes to it?'    \"Well, that was all I could get out of him that time, and later on he  seemed as if he was ashamed of being so frightened, and he used to put  me off when I asked him about it. But years after, when I was got to  be a grown man, we had more talk now and again on the matter, and he  always said the same thing. 'Black it was,' he'd say, 'and a mass of  hair, and two legs, and the light caught on its eyes.'    \"Well, that's the tale of that tomb, Mr. Lake; it's one we don't tell  to our visitors, and I should be obliged to you not to make any use of  it till I'm out of the way. I doubt Mr. Evans'll feel the same as I  do, if you ask him.\"    This proved to be the case. But over twenty years have passed by, and  the grass is growing over both Worby and Evans; so Mr. Lake felt no  difficulty about communicating his notes--taken in 1890--to me. He  accompanied them with a sketch of the tomb and a copy of the short  inscription on the metal cross which was affixed at the expense of Dr.  Lyall to the centre of the northern side. It was from the Vulgate of  Isaiah xxxiv., and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20390"],[0,"Elements of Structural and Systematic Botany (#12)"],[1,"(Fig. 32, _F_, _H_).  These small sporangia have no columella.    Other moulds are sometimes met with, parasitic upon the larger species  of _Mucor_.    Related to the black moulds are the insect moulds (_Entomopthoreae_),  which attack and destroy insects. The commonest of these attacks the  house flies in autumn, when the flies, thus infested, may often be  found sticking to window panes, and surrounded by a whitish halo of  the spores that have been thrown off by the fungus.      ORDER II.--WHITE RUSTS AND MILDEWS (_Peronosporeae_)    These are exclusively parasitic fungi, and grow within the tissues of  various flowering plants, sometimes entirely destroying them.    As a type of this group we will select a very common one (_Cystopus  bliti_), that is always to be found in late summer and autumn growing  on pig weed (_Amarantus_). It forms whitish, blister-like blotches  about the size of a pin head on the leaves and stems, being commonest  on the under side of the leaves (Fig. 33, _A_). In the earlier stages  the leaf does not appear much affected, but later becomes brown and  withered about the blotches caused by the fungus.      If a thin vertical section of the leaf is made through one of these    blotches, and mounted as described for _Mucor_, the latter is found    to be composed of a mass of spores that have been produced below the    epidermis of the leaf, and have pushed it up by their growth. If the    section is a very thin one, we may be able to make out the structure    of the fungus, and then find it to be composed of irregular,    tubular, much-branched filaments, which, however, are not divided by    cross-walls. These filaments run through the intercellular spaces of    the leaf, and send into the cells little globular suckers, by means    of which the fungus feeds.      The spores already mentioned are formed at the ends of crowded    filaments, that push up, and finally rupture the epidermis (Fig. 33,    _B_). They are formed by the ends of the filaments swelling up and    becoming constricted, so as to form an oval spore, which is then cut    off by a wall. The portion of the filament immediately below acts in    the same way, and the process is repeated until a chain of half a    dozen or more may be produced, the lowest one being always the last    formed. When ripe, the spores are separated by a thin neck, and    become very easily broken off.      In order to follow their germination it is only necessary to place a    few leaves with fresh patches of the fungus under a bell jar or    tumbler, inverted over a dish full of water, so as to keep the air    within saturated with moisture, but taking care to keep the leaves    out of the water. After about twenty-four hours, if some of the    spores are scraped off and mounted in water, they will germinate in    the course of an hour or so. The contents divide into about eight    parts, which escape from the top of the spore, which at this time    projects as a little papilla. On escaping, each mass of protoplasm    swims away as a zooespore, with two extremely delicate cilia. After a    short time it comes to rest, and, after developing a thin cell wall,    germinates by sending out one or two filaments (Fig. 33, _C_, _E_).    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--_A_, leaf of pig-weed (_Amarantus_), with  spots of white rust (_c_), one-half natural size. _B_, non-sexual  spores (conidia). _C_, the same germinating. _D_, zooespores. _E_,  germinating zooespores. _sp._ the spore. _F_, young. _G_, mature sexual  organs.

All x 300.]      Under normal conditions the spores probably germinate when the    leaves are wet, and the filaments enter the plant through the    breathing pores on the lower surface of the leaves, and spread    rapidly through the intercellular spaces.      Later on, spores of a very different kind are produced. Unlike those    already studied, they are formed some distance below the epidermis,    and in order to study them satisfactorily, the fungus must be freed    from the host plant. In order to do this, small pieces of the leaf    should be boiled for about a minute in strong caustic potash, and    then treated with acetic or hydrochloric acid. By this means the    tissues of the leaf become so soft as to be readily removed, while    the fungus is but little affected. The preparation should now be    washed and mounted in dilute glycerine.      The spores (ooespores) are much larger than those first formed, and    possess an outer coat of a dark brown color (Fig. 33, _H_). Each    spore is contained in a large cell, which arises as a swelling of    one of the filaments, and becomes shut off by a wall. At first    (Fig. 33, _F_) its contents are granular, and fill it completely,    but later contract to form a globular mass of protoplasm (G.    _o_), the germ cell or egg cell. The whole is an ooegonium, and    differs in no essential respect from that of _Vaucheria_.      Frequently a smaller cell (antheridium), arising from a neighboring    filament, and in close contact with the ooegonium, may be detected    (Fig. 33, _F_, _G_, _an._), and in exceptionally favorable cases a    tube is to be seen connecting it with the germ cell, and by means of    which fertilization is effected.      After being fertilized, the germ cell secretes a wall, at first thin    and colorless, but later becoming thick and dark-colored on the    outside, and showing a division into several layers, the outermost    of which is dark brown, and covered with irregular reticulate    markings. These spores do not germinate at once, but remain over    winter unchanged.    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Fragment of a filament of the white rust of  the shepherd's-purse, showing the suckers (_h_), x 300.]    It is by no means impossible that sometimes the germ cell may develop  into a spore without being fertilized, as is the case in many of the  water moulds.    Closely related to the species above described is another one  (_C. candidus_), which attacks shepherd's-purse, radish, and others of  the mustard family, upon which it forms chalky white blotches, and  distorts the diseased parts of the plant very greatly.      For some reasons this is the best species for study, longitudinal    sections through the stem showing very beautifully the structure of    the fungus, and the penetration of the cells of the host[4] by the    suckers (Fig. 34).    [4] \"Host,\" the plant or animal upon which a parasite lives.    [Illustration: FIG. 35.--Non-sexual spores of the vine mildew  (_Peronospora viticola_), x 150.]    Very similar to the white rusts in most respects, but differing in the  arrangement of the non-sexual spores, are the mildews (_Peronospora_,  _Phytophthora_). These plants form mouldy-looking patches on the  leaves and stems of many plants, and are often very destructive. Among  them are the vine mildew (_Peronospora viticola_) (Fig. 35), the  potato fungus (_Phytophthora infestans_), and many others.      ORDER III.--_Saprolegniaceae_ (WATER MOULDS).    These plants resemble quite closely the white rusts, and are probably  related to them. They grow on decaying organic matter in water, or  sometimes on living water animals, fish, crustaceans, etc. They may  usually be had for study by throwing into water taken from a stagnant  pond or aquarium, a dead fly or some other insect. After a few days it  will probably be found covered with a dense growth of fine, white  filaments, standing out from it in all directions (Fig. 36, _A_).  Somewhat later, if carefully examined with a lens, little round, white  bodies may be seen scattered among the filaments.    [Illustration: FIG. 36.--_A_, an insect that has decayed in water, and  become attacked by a water mould (_Saprolegnia_), natural size. _B_, a  ripe zooesporangium, x 100. _C_, the same discharging the spores. _D_,  active. _E_, germinating zooespores, x 300. _F_, a second sporangium  forming below the empty one. _G_ i-iv, development of the ooegonium,  x 100. _H_, ripe ooegonium filled with resting spores, x 100.]      On carefully removing a bit of the younger growth and examining it    microscopically, it is found to consist of long filaments much like    those of _Vaucheria_, but entirely destitute of chlorophyll. In    places these filaments are filled with densely granular protoplasm,    which when highly magnified exhibits streaming movements. The    protoplasm contains a large amount of oil in the form of small,    shining drops.      In the early stages of its growth the plant multiplies by zooespores,    produced in great numbers in sporangia at the ends of the branches.    The protoplasm collects here much as we saw in _V. sessilis_, the    end of the filament becoming club-shaped and ending in a short    protuberance (Fig. 36, _B_). This end becomes separated by a wall,    and the contents divide into numerous small cells that sometimes are    naked, and sometimes have a delicate membrane about them. The first    sign of division is the appearance in the protoplasm of delicate    lines dividing it into numerous polygonal areas which soon become    more distinct, and are seen to be distinct cells whose outlines    remain more or less angular on account of the mutual pressure. When    ripe, the end of the sporangium opens, and the contained cells are    discharged (Fig. 36, _C_). In case they have no membrane, they swim    away at once, each being provided with two cilia, and resembling    almost exactly the zooespores of the white rust (Fig. 36, _D_, _E_).    When the cells are surrounded by a membrane they remain for some    time at rest, but finally the contents escape as a zooespore, like    those already described.
