Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!         _Falstaff._ My lord.... For my _voice_, I have _lost it       with_ hollaing, and _singing of anthems_.    _H. 4. B._ II, i, 88.         _Hostess._ Thou didst swear to me ... upon Wednesday in       Wheeson week, when the prince broke thy head for liking his       father to a _singing-man of Windsor_.    _Hen. 4. A._ II, iv, 137. Falstaff laments the degeneracy of the  times.         _Fal._ There live not three good men unhanged in England,       and one of them is fat, and grows old; God help the while! a       bad world, I say. _I would I were a weaver; I could sing       psalms or anything._    This last sentence connects curiously with Sir John Oldcastle, the  leader of the Lollards, who were noted for their psalm singing, which  indeed gave them the name. These Flemish Protestants, who had fled  from the persecutions in their own country, were mostly _woollen_  manufacturers, and were distinguished for their love of Psalmody,  throughout the western counties, where they settled. Hence the  allusion to 'weavers' and 'Psalms.' But according to the Epilogue of  _Hen. 4. B._, 'Oldcastle died a martyr, and _this is not the man_.'    Falstaff knew well what a Ballad was too--as the following shews:--    _Hen. 4. A._ II, ii, 43.         _Fal._ (to Hal.). Go hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent       garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I have not       _ballads made on you all_, and _sung to filthy tunes_, let a       cup of sack be my poison.    Two other worthy knights claim our attention in the next quotation,  which contains many interesting allusions. _Inter alia_; Sir Toby  gives Feste sixpence to sing a song; Sir Andrew follows it up with a  'testril.' The Clown then sings them 'O mistress mine.' [For the  original music see Prof. Bridge's 'Shakespeare Songs,' Novello, a  collection which every reader of Shakespeare ought to have. Price 2s.  6d.] Then, at Sir Toby's suggestion, they all three sing a catch, or,  in his own words, 'draw _three_ souls out of _one_ weaver,' an  allusion to the _three_ vocal parts which are evolved from the _one_  melody of the catch, as well as a sly reference to 'weavers' singing  catches. (See Introduction.) They sing 'Thou knave,' for which see the  Appendix. It is not a good catch, but sounds humorous if done smartly,  and perhaps its very roughness suits the circumstances. Next, after  Maria's entrance, Toby either quotes the titles, or sings odd lines of  four old songs [Appendix]; and when Malvolio comes in, furious with  the noise they are making in the middle of the night, he applies  precisely those epithets to their proceedings that our histories lead  us to expect--_e.g._, 'gabbling like _tinkers_,' '_alehouse_,'  squeaking out your '_cozier's_ catches' ['cozier' is 'cobbler']. Sir  Toby's puns on 'keep time' in ll. 94 and 115 ought not to be missed.  To 'keep time' is almost the only virtue a catch singer _must_ have.    _Tw._ II, iii, 18.         _Sir To._ Welcome, ass. Now _let's have a catch_.         _Sir And._ By my troth, the fool has an _excellent breast_.       I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg, and so       _sweet a breath to sing_, as the fool has.         L. 30.         _Sir And._ Now, _a song_.         _Sir To._ Come on; there is _sixpence_ for you; let's have       _a song_.         _Sir And._ There's a _testril_ of me too; if one knight give       a----         _Clown._ Would you have a _love-song_, or a _song of good       life_?         _Sir To._ A love-song, a love-song.         _Sir And._ Ay, ay; I care not for good life.         [_Clown_ sings 'O mistress mine.']         _Sir And._ A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.         _Sir To._ A contagious breath.         _Sir And._ Very sweet and contagious, i'faith.         _Sir To._ To _hear by the nose_, it is _dulcet in       contagion_. But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall       we rouse the night-owl in a _catch_, that will _draw three       souls out of one weaver_? Shall we do that?         _Sir And._ An you love me, let's do't: I am _dog at a       catch_.         _Clo._ By'r lady, sir, and _some dogs_ will _catch well_.         _Sir And._ Most certain. Let our _catch_ be, \"Thou Knave.\"         _Clo._ \"Hold thy peace, thou knave,\" knight? I shall be       constrained to _call thee knave_, knight.         _Sir And._ 'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to       call me knave. _Begin_, fool: it begins, \"_Hold thy peace_.\"         _Clo._ I shall never begin, if I hold my peace.         _Sir And._ Good, i'faith. Come, begin.         [_They sing a catch._]         _Enter_ MARIA.         _Mar._ What a caterwauling do you keep here!           *       *       *       *       *         _Sir To._ My lady's a Cataian; we are politicians;       Malvolio's a Peg-a-Ramsey, and \"_Three merry men be we_.\"...       _Tilly-valley_, lady! [_Sings._] \"There dwelt a man in       Babylon, lady, lady!\"           *       *       *       *       *         _Sir To._ [_Sings._] \"O! the twelfth day of December.\"----         _Mar._ For the love o'God, peace!         _Enter_ MALVOLIO.         _Mal._ My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have you no       wit, manners, nor honesty, but to _gabble like tinkers_ at       this time of night? Do ye make an _alehouse_ of my lady's       house, that ye squeak out your _cozier's catches_ without       any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of       place, persons, or _time_ in you?         _Sir To._ _We did keep time, sir, in our catches._ Sneck up!    L. 103-114, another song, \"Farewell, dear heart\" [Appendix].    It is perhaps necessary to explain the nature of a Catch, or Round,  more clearly. The two names were interchangeable in the 16th and 17th  centuries. It was not till quite modern times that 'Catch' implied a  necessary quibble in the words, deliberately arranged by the writer.  First, a Catch or Round of the best type of Elizabethan times  consisted of _one melody_, generally perfectly continuous. Secondly,  the said melody was always divisible into a certain number of _equal  sections_, varying from three to six, or even eight; and as many  sections as there were, so many voices were necessary. Thirdly, each  of these equal sections was deliberately arranged so as to make  _Harmony_ with every other.    Here are the words of a Round of the 17th century, which is divisible  into three equal sections, and therefore is sung by three voices.         1. 'Cuckoo! Hark! how he sings to us.       2. Good news the cuckoo brings to us;       3. Spring is here, says the cuckoo.'    Now, the way for three persons, A, B, and C, to sing this Catch or  Round, is as follows:--    A begins [see above, line 69, '_Begin_, fool'] line 1, and immediately  proceeds to line 2; at this very instant, B in his turn begins line 1,  and acts similarly. When A has reached the first syllable in line 3,  and B is at 'Good' in line 2, it is time for C also to begin at line  1. As soon as A has finished line 3, he begins again; and so on with  the others--'round' and 'round' till they are tired of 'catching' each  other up.    Thus when they are all three fairly set going, their _one_ melody  produces _three part_ harmony, and the catchers have drawn 'three  souls out of one weaver.'    The principle in all other Catches or Rounds is exactly the same,  however great the number of parts.    In the following we have another case of catch-singing. The original  music of 'Flout 'em' has not come down to us.    _Tempest_ III, ii, 122.         _Stephano._ Come on, Trinculo, _let us sing_.         [They sing a _catch_, 'Flout 'em and scout 'em.']         _Caliban._ That's not the tune. [Very likely, as they       were tipsy.]         [ARIEL _plays the tune on a tabor and pipe_.]         _Ste._ What is this same?         _Trin._ This is the _tune of our catch_, played by the       picture of Nobody.                *       *       *       *       *         L. 136.         _Cal._ Be not afeard; the isle is _full of noises_,            _Sounds_, and _sweet airs_, that give delight, and hurt not.            Sometimes a thousand _twangling instruments_            Will hum about mine ears; and sometime _voices_, &c.         _Ste._ This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I       _shall have my music for nothing_.         L. 152.         I would, I could _see_ this taborer: [Ariel] he _lays it       on_.    Also _Id._ III, ii, 119.    Stephano, like most of the scamps in Shakespeare, is a good musician.  He leads the catch, appreciates Ariel's tabor playing (l. 152), and is  overjoyed to think that he will have all his music 'for nothing' (l.  145) in the magical isle.    Finally, in the _Taming of the Shrew_, we have the title of another  old catch, of which the music has survived--viz., 'Jack, boy.'    _Shrew_ IV, i, 42.         _Curtis._ Therefore, good Grumio, the _news_.         _Grumio._ Why, \"_Jack, boy! ho, boy!_\" and as much _news_ as       thou wilt.    The words of this catch, which takes four voices, are--         'Jack, boy, ho! boy, news;       The cat is in the well,       Let us ring now for her knell,       Ding, dong, ding, dong, bell.'    The music [see Appendix], like that of so many other catches, is  anonymous, and is of some date long before Shakespeare.    _As You_ V, iii, 7.         _Touchstone._ By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a       _song_.         _2 Page._ We are for you; sit i' the middle.         _1 Page._ Shall we _clap into 't roundly, without hawking,       or spitting_, or _saying we are hoarse_, which are the _only       prologues to a bad voice_?         _2 Page._ I' faith, i' faith; and _both in a tune_, like two       gipsies on a horse.    [Song follows, 'It was a lover.' Could be sung as a _two_-part  madrigal quite easily."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19699"],[0,"Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, \"Bréquigny, Louis Georges Oudard Feudrix (#12)"],[1,"disadvantage that only coarse grists can be employed.  This entails loss of extract in several ways. To begin with, the sparging  process is at best a somewhat inefficient method for washing out the last  portions of the wort, and again, when the malt is at all hard or \"steely,\"  starch conversion is by no means complete. These disadvantages are overcome  by the filter press process, which was first introduced into Great Britain  by the Belgian engineer P. Meura. The malt, in this method of brewing, is  ground quite fine, and although an ordinary mash-tun may be used for  mashing, the separation of the clear wort from the solid matter takes place  in the filter press, which retains the very finest particles with ease. It  is also a simple matter to wash out the wort from the filter cake in the  presses, and experience has shown that markedly increased yields are thus  obtained. In the writer's opinion, there is little doubt that in the future  this, or a similar process, will find a very wide application.    _Boiling_.--From the mash-tun the wort passes to the _copper_. If it is not  possible to arrange the plant so that the coppers are situated beneath the  mash-tuns (as is the case in breweries arranged on the _gravitation  system_), an intermediate collecting vessel (the underback) is interposed,  and from this the wort is pumped into the copper. The latter is a large  copper vessel heated by direct fire or steam. Modern coppers are generally  closed in with a dome-shaped head, but many old-fashioned open coppers are  still to be met with, in fact pale-ale brewers prefer open coppers. In the  closed type the wort is frequently boiled under slight pressure. When the  wort has been raised to the boil, the hops or a part thereof are added, and  the boiling is continued generally from an hour to three hours, according  to the type of beer. The objects of boiling, briefly put, are: (1)  sterilization of the wort; (2) extraction from the hops of substances that  give flavour and aroma to the beer; (3) the coagulation and precipitation  of a part of the nitrogenous matter (the coagulable albuminoids), which, if  left in, would cause cloudiness and fret, &c., in the finished beer; (4)  the concentration of the wort. At least three distinct substances are  extracted from the hops in boiling. First, the _hop tannin_, which,  combining with a part of the proteids derived from the malt, precipitates  them; second, the _hop resin_, which acts as a preservative and bitter;  third, the _hop oil_, to which much of the fine aroma of beer is due. The  latter is volatile, and it is customary, therefore, not to add the whole of  the hops to the wort when it commences to boil, but to reserve about a  third until near the end of the copper stage. The quantity of hops employed  varies according to the type of beer, from about 3 lb to 15 lb per quarter  (336 lb) of malt. For mild ales and porters about 3 to 4 lb, for light pale  ales and light stouts 6 to 10 lb, and for strong ales and stouts 9 to 15 lb  of hops are employed.    _Cooling_.--When the wort has boiled the necessary time, it is turned into  the _hop back_ to settle. A hop back is a wooden or metal vessel, fitted  with a false bottom of perforated plates; the latter retain the spent hops,  the wort being drawn off into the coolers. After resting for a brief period  in the hop back, the bright wort is run into the _coolers_. The cooler is a  very shallow vessel of great area, and the result of the exposure of the  hot wort to a comparatively large volume of air is that a part of the hop  constituents and other substances contained in the wort are rendered  insoluble and are precipitated. It was formerly considered absolutely  essential that this hot aeration should take place, but in many breweries  nowadays coolers are not used, the wort being run direct from the hop back  to the refrigerator. There is much to be said for this procedure, as the  exposure of hot wort in the cooler is attended with much danger of  bacterial and wild yeast infection, but it is still a moot point whether  the cooler or its equivalent can be entirely dispensed with for all classes  of beers. A rational alteration would appear to be to place the cooler in  an air-tight chamber supplied with purified and sterilized air. This  principle has already been applied to the refrigerator, and apparently with  success. In America the cooler is frequently replaced by a cooling tank, an  enclosed vessel of some depth, capable of artificial aeration. It is not  practicable, in any case, to cool the wort sufficiently on the cooler to  bring it to the proper temperature for the fermentation stage, and for this  purpose, therefore, the _refrigerator_ is employed. There are several kinds  of refrigerators, the main distinction being that some are vertical, others  horizontal; but the principle in each case is much the same, and consists  in allowing a thin film or stream of wort to trickle over a series of pipes  through which cold water circulates. Fig. 5, Plate I., shows refrigerators,  employed in Messrs Allsopp's lager beer brewery, at work.    _Fermenting_.--By the process of fermentation the wort is converted into  beer. By the action of living yeast cells (see FERMENTATION) the sugar  contained in the wort is split up into alcohol and carbonic acid, and a  number of subsidiary reactions occur. There are two main systems of  fermentation, the _top fermentation_ system, which is that employed in the  United Kingdom, and the _bottom fermentation_ system, which is that used  for the production of beers of the continental (\"lager\") type. The wort,  generally at a temperature of about 60 deg. F. (this applies to all the systems  excepting B [see below], in which the temperature is higher), is \"pitched\"  with liquid yeast (or \"barm,\" as it is often called) at the rate of,  according to the type and strength of the beer to be made, 1 to 4 lb to the  barrel. After a few hours a slight froth or scum makes its appearance on  the surface of the liquid. At the end of a further short period this  develops into a light curly mass (_cauliflower_ or _curly head_), which  gradually becomes lighter and more solid in appearance, and is then known  as _rocky head_. This in its turn shrinks to a compact mass--the _yeasty  head_--which emits great bubbles of gas with a hissing sound. At this point  the _cleansing_ of the beer--_i.e._ the separation of the yeast from the  liquid--has fairly commenced, and it is let down (except in the skimming  and Yorkshire systems [see below]) into the pontos or unions, as the case  may be. During fermentation the temperature rises considerably, and in  order to prevent an excessive temperature being obtained (70-75 deg. F. should  be the maximum) the fermenting vessels are fitted with \"attemperators,\"  _i.e._ a system of pipes through which cold water may be run.    _Cleansing_.--In England the methods of applying the top fermentation  system may be classified as follows: (A) _The Cleansing System_: (a)  Skimming System, (b) Dropping System (pontos or ordinary dropping system),  (c) Burton Union System. (B) _The Yorkshire Stone Square System_.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Fermenting Round.  A, Skimmer; B, Parachute; C, Attemperator.]    (A) In (a) the _Skimming System_ the fermentation from start to finish  takes place in wooden vessels (termed \"squares\" or \"rounds\"), fitted with  an attemperator and a parachute or other similar skimming device for  removing or \"skimming\" the yeast at the end of the fermentation (fig. 4).  The principle of (b) the _Dropping System_ is that the beer undergoes only  the main fermentation in the \"round\" or \"square,\" and is then dropped down  into a second vessel or vessels, in which fermentation and cleansing are  completed. The _ponto_ system of dropping, which is now somewhat  old-fashioned, consists in discharging the beer into a series of vat-like  vessels, fitted with a peculiarly-shaped overflow lip. The yeast works its  way out of the vessel over the lip, and then flows into a gutter and is  collected. The pontos are kept filled with beer by means of a vessel placed  at a higher level. In the _ordinary_ dropping system the partly fermented  beer is let down from the \"squares\" and \"rounds\" into large vessels, termed  dropping or skimming \"backs.\" These are fitted with attemperators, and  parachutes for the removal of yeast, in much the same way as in the  skimming system. As a rule the parachute covers the whole width of the  back. (c) The _Burton Union System_ is really an improved ponto system. A  series of casks, supplied with beer at the cleansing stage from a feed  vessel, are mounted so that they may rotate axially. Each cask is fitted  with an attemperator, a pipe and cock at the base for the removal of the  finished beer and \"bottoms,\" and lastly with a swan neck fitting through a  bung-hole and commanding a common gutter. This system yields excellent  results for certain classes of beers, and many Burton brewers think it is  essential for obtaining [v.04 p.0511] the Burton character. Fig. 6 (Plate  II.) shows the process in operation in Messrs Allsopp's brewery.    (B) _The Stone Square System_, which is only used to a certain extent  (exclusively in the north of England), practically consists in pumping the  fermenting wort from one to the other of two superimposed square vessels,  connected with one another by means of a man-hole and a valve. These  squares are built of stone and kept very cool. At the end of the  fermentation the yeast (after closing the man-hole) is removed from the top  square.    _Racking, &c._--After the fermentation and cleansing operations are  completed, the beer is racked off (sometimes after passing a few hours in a  settling tank) into storage vessels or trade casks. The finest \"stock\" and  \"pale\" ales are stored from six weeks to three months prior to going out,  but \"running\" beers (mild ales, &c.) are"]]]
