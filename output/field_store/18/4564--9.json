[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20248"],[0,"The Necessity of Atheism (#12)"],[1,"sceptics may still see, upon the rock where stands  the Mosque of Omar in Jerusalem, the identical print of the Prophet's  foot where he leaped upon the Heavenly Charger.    His thoughts, whether conceived in a white heat of frenzy, or with  deliberate coolness and sly calculations for the main chance, were  probably not written down in any definite manner during his lifetime. It  is not even certain whether he could read or write. He delighted in the  appellation, \"The Illiterate Prophet,\" possibly on account of his  humility and possibly because he knew that inspired ignorance had been  the indisputable prerogative of all successful prophets in the past.  Indeed, the very fact that he was unlearned was rightly supposed to  increase the miraculous nature of his revelations. As he tossed the  divine emanations from his lips, they were sometimes recorded by  hireling scribes upon palm leaves, leather, stones, the shoulder blades  or ribs of camels and goats. But often they were not immediately written  down at all; the Prophet would go around spouting forth his utterances  to his followers, who, trained from infancy to memorize verses and songs  of every sort with infallible precision, would piously commit them to  memory. Such is the Koran, and through its instrumentality, Allah the  Wise, The Only Wise, revealed his immutable decrees: to the good, the  rewards of a Paradise that utterly beggared the Christian Heaven; to the  bad, the punishments of a Hell that contained an infinity of such  refined tortures of heat, and even of cold as neither the most  imaginatively gifted Jew or Christian had yet conceived.    Reinach aptly states, \"It is humiliating to the human intellect to think  that this mediocre literature has been the subject of innumerable  commentaries and that millions of men are still wasting time in  absorbing it.\" Over one hundred and sixty million are adherents of the  Koran.    In an objective analysis, excluding the emotional factors of religious  bias, Mohammed would as unquestionably be considered a victim of mental  disturbances as an individual living in our own day and manifesting the  same symptoms.    Mohammed was the subject of illusions, hallucinations, and delusions. He  had suicidal tendencies, and he had alternating periods of exhilaration  and depression. To simply assert that he was an epileptic does not  explain these symptoms. For epileptics cannot throw a fit at will.  However, we know that ten per cent of epileptics develop mental  diseases, no particular psychosis but a loss of mental and moral sense.    There are two types of individuals who can produce seizures such as  Mohammed was wont to evoke at will. One type is the hysterical, and the  other is that degraded individual who for the sake of collecting alms  will place a piece of soap in his mouth, enter a crowded street, fall  to the ground, and proceed to foam at the mouth and twist and contort  himself as an epileptic does. That is the charlatan, the faker, and that  brings us to the second aspect of his (Mohammed's) character.    \"Outside of Arabia, Paganism was in general disrepute. The dissolute and  declining Romans were cracking lewd jokes in the very faces of their  gods, the myriad followers of Confucius, Buddha and Zoroaster were  either too remote or too helpless to matter in one way or another.  Talmudic Judaism and Oriental Christianity despised idolatry and  worshipped the same Jehovah, even though they disputed with each other,  and indeed, among themselves, concerning the various attributes, amorous  pursuits, and lineal descendants of the Godhead. Now, to one who chose  to regard himself as a prophet, Monotheism had distinct advantages over  Polytheism.\" (_Mohammed--R. F. Dibble._)    In the first place, it was rather confusing to attempt to obey the  behests of conflicting deities; in the second place, the different  prophets of Jehovah in Judaism and Christendom had, so far as Mohammed  knew, been uniformly successful, for he was familiar with the glorious  history of Abraham, Moses, and David, and he always held to the perverse  conception that Jesus was not crucified. However deep in the dumps  prophets may have been on occasion, they have invariably believed one  thing: victory for their particular cause would inevitably come. Neither  an unbroken series of worldly failures nor the chastisement of his god  have ever shaken the faith of a first-class prophet in himself or, as he  would doubtless prefer to say, in his Divinity. Arabia, broken,  unorganized, inglorious, idolistic Arabia, obviously lacked one Supreme  Being whose prerogative was greater than all other Supreme Beings, and  that Being, in turn, needed a messenger to exploit His supremacy. The  messengers who had served Jehovah had certainly prospered well; but  Jehovah Himself appeared to be on the decline. His Unity was steadily  disintegrating into a paradoxical Trinity. Why, therefore, not give  Allah, the leading icon in Arabia, an opportunity? Such considerations  quite probably never entered the head of Mohammed with any definiteness;  yet his behavior for the rest of his days seems to indicate that these,  or similar conceptions, were subconsciously egging him on.    Of certain facts, moreover, he was definitely aware. He may have had  little or no formal education, but his memory was retentive and  capacious, and his caravan journeys, together with the scores of  conversations he had held at the yearly fairs, as well as at Mecca, with  many cultivated strangers, had packed his mind with a mass of highly  valuable matter. In these ways he had learned both the strength and the  weakness of the Jews and Christians; their fanatical enthusiasm and  despairs; their spasmodic attempts to proselytize as well as the  widespread defection from their faiths. \"Since his conception of  religion was largely personal, for he looked upon Moses, Jesus, and the  rest of the prophets as merely capable men who had founded and  promulgated religions; and since Arabia had no pre-eminent ruler, why  should he not seize the reins of power and carry on the great tradition  of prophethood? What a magnificent opportunity beckoned, and how  fortunate that he had been the first to recognize the call! By keeping  only what was best of the Arabic faith, the Kaaba and the Black Stone,  and by a judicious selection of the most feasible ideas which lay  imbedded in Jewish and Christian precepts, he might establish a code  that would supersede all others, and then might dictate to all Arabs  alike. What prophets had done, he would also do and do better.\"  (_Mohammed--R. F. Dibble._)    Such are the thoughts of a charlatan and _a_ demagogue. If Mohammed  actually had such ideas, we can never know; but a study of his further  actions and conquests surely shows that he must have had something of  the same trend of thought in mind.    His \"fits\" before the oncoming of a new Sura have been mentioned.  Eventually, he so perfected his technique that he could throw a  cataleptic fit and produce a message without any previous preparation.  He would drum up a crowd with his ludicrous snortings and puffings until  the resounding cry, \"Inspiration hath descended on the Prophet!\" assured  him that he had a sufficiently large audience to warrant the  out-spurting of a new Sura. While in a room that was obviously empty, he  declared that all seats were occupied by angels; he cultivated suave and  benign expression; he flattered and astounded his followers by telling  them facts which he had presumably acquired through private information;  he took the most painstaking care of his person, painting his eyes and  perfuming his entire body daily, and wearing his hair long. Ayesha, one  of the Prophet's wives, remarked that the Prophet loved three things:  women, scent and food, and that he had his heart's content of the first  two, but not of the last. In fact, Mohammed, himself, argued that these  two innocuous diversions intensified the ecstasy of his prayers. In the  Koran's description of heaven so much emphasis was put on food that a  jolly Jew objected on the grounds that such continual feasting must of  necessity be followed by a purgation. The Prophet, however, swore that  it would not even be necessary to blow the nose in Paradise, since all  bodily impurities would be carried off by a perspiration \"as odoriferous  as musk.\"    When his wife Khadija was dying he comforted her with the assurance that  she, together with three other well-known women, the Virgin Mary,  Potiphar's wife, and \"Kulthum,\" Moses' sister, would occupy his chamber  in Paradise.    On Mohammed's escape to Medina, a long series of holy wars began which,  like all holy wars, were characterized by extreme brutality. The Koran  of the period contains such pacific doctrines as these: \"The sword is  the key of Heaven and Hell; a drop of blood shed in the cause of God, a  night spent in arms is of more avail than two months of fasting or  prayer; whosoever falls in battle, his sins are forgiven. At the day of  Judgment his wounds shall be resplendent as vermilion, and odoriferous  as musk; and the loss of limbs shall be supplied by the wings of angels  and cherubim ... God loveth not the Transgressors; kill them wheresoever  ye find them.\"    Mohammed, no less than many other religiously-minded emperors and tsars,  appears to have conducted himself in battle according to the wise  principle that a head without a halo is infinitely more desirable than a  halo without a head. Yet he was profoundly convinced that the ultimate  victory of Islam depended upon the sword. The Koran of this period  breathes defiance against the enemies of Islam on almost every page. Its  profuse maledictions, once confined to the evildoers of Mecca, now  include all unbelievers everywhere. When Mohammed once had captured a  fortress inhabited by a tribe of Jews, his judgment was, \"The men shall  be put to death, the women and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2028"],[0,"The Yellow Claw (#12)"],[1,"r--perfectly comfortable!\"    \"You should not be in--THIS room, at all. In fact, you should go right  away.\"...    \"I cannot... my wife may--return--at any moment.\" His voice shook.  \"I--am expecting her return--hourly.\"...    His gaze sought the table-clock; and he drew his lips very tightly  together when the pitiless hands forced upon his mind the fact that the  day was marching to its end.    Helen turned her head aside, inhaling deeply, and striving for  composure.    \"Garnham shall come down and tidy up for you,\" she said, quietly; \"and  you must dine with us.\"    The outer door was noisily closed by the departing servants.    \"You are much too good,\" whispered Leroux, again; and the weary eyes  glistened with a sudden moisture. \"Thank you! Thank you! But--er--I  could not dream of disturbing\"...    \"Mr. Leroux,\" said Helen, with all her old firmness--\"Garnham is coming  down IMMEDIATELY to put the place in order! And, whilst he is doing so,  you are going to prepare yourself for a decent, Christian dinner!\"    Henry Leroux rested one hand upon the table, looking down at the  carpet. He had known for a long time, in a vague fashion, that he lacked  something; that his success--a wholly inartistic one--had yielded him  little gratification; that the comfort of his home was a purely monetary  product and not in any sense atmospheric. He had schooled himself to  believe that he liked loneliness--loneliness physical and mental, and  that in marrying a pretty, but pleasure-loving girl, he had insured an  ideal menage. Furthermore, he honestly believed that he worshiped  his wife; and with his present grief at her unaccountable silence was  mingled no atom of reproach.    But latterly he had begun to wonder--in his peculiarly indefinite way  he had begun to doubt his own philosophy. Was the void in his soul a  product of thwarted ambition?--for, whilst he slaved, scrupulously, upon  \"Martin Zeda,\" he loathed every deed and every word of that Old Man of  the Sea. Or could it be that his own being--his nature of Adam--lacked  something which wealth, social position, and Mira, his wife, could not  yield to him?    Now, a new tone in the voice of Helen Cumberly--a tone different from  that compound of good-fellowship and raillery, which he knew--a tone  which had entered into it when she had exclaimed upon the state of the  room--set his poor, anxious heart thrumming like a lute. He felt a hot  flush creeping upon him; his forehead grew damp. He feared to raise his  eyes.    \"Is that a bargain?\" asked Helen, sweetly.    Henry Leroux found a lump in his throat; but he lifted his untidy head  and took the hand which the girl had extended to him. She smiled a bit  unnaturally; then every tinge of color faded from her cheeks, and Henry  Leroux, unconsciously holding the white hand in a vice-like grip, looked  hungrily into the eyes grown suddenly tragic whilst into his own came  the light of a great and sorrowful understanding.    \"God bless you,\" he said. \"I will do anything you wish.\"    Helen released her hand, turned, and ran from the study. Not until she  was on the landing did she dare to speak. Then:--    \"Garnham shall come down immediately. Don't be late for dinner!\" she  called--and there was a hint of laughter and of tears in her voice, of  the restraint of culture struggling with rebellious womanhood.          XI    PRESENTING M. GASTON MAX      Not venturing to turn on the light, not daring to look upon her own face  in the mirror, Helen Cumberly sat before her dressing-table, trembling  wildly. She wanted to laugh, and wanted to cry; but the daughter of  Seton Cumberly knew what those symptoms meant and knew how to deal with  them. At the end of an interval of some four or five minutes, she rang.    The maid opened the door.    \"Don't light up, Merton,\" she said, composedly. \"I want you to tell  Garnham to go down to Mr. Leroux's and put the place in order. Mr.  Leroux is dining with us.\"    The girl withdrew; and Helen, as the door closed, pressed the electric  switch. She stared at her reflection in the mirror as if it were the  face of an enemy, then, turning her head aside, sat deep in reflection,  biting her lip and toying with the edge of the white doily.    \"You little traitor!\" she whispered, through clenched teeth. \"You little  traitor--and hypocrite\"--sobs began to rise in her throat--\"and fool!\"    Five more minutes passed in a silent conflict. A knock announced the  return of the maid; and the girl reentered, placing upon the table a  visiting-card:--      DENISE RYLAND    ATELIER 4, RUE DU COQ D'OR,    MONTMARTRE,    PARIS.      Helen Cumberly started to her feet with a stifled exclamation and turned  to the maid; her face, to which the color slowly had been returning,  suddenly blanched anew.    \"Denise Ryland!\" she muttered, still holding the card in her hand,  \"why--that's Mrs. Leroux's friend, with whom she had been staying in  Paris! Whatever can it mean?\"    \"Shall I show her in here, please?\" asked the maid.    \"Yes, in here,\" replied Helen, absently; and, scarcely aware that she  had given instructions to that effect, she presently found herself  confronted by the lady of the boat-train!    \"Miss Cumberly?\" said the new arrival in a pleasant American voice.    \"Yes--I am Helen Cumberly. Oh! I am so glad to know you at last! I have  often pictured you; for Mira--Mrs. Leroux--is always talking about you,  and about the glorious times you have together! I have sometimes longed  to join you in beautiful Paris. How good of you to come back with her!\"    Miss Ryland unrolled the Scotch muffler from her throat, swinging her  head from side to side in a sort of spuriously truculent manner, quite  peculiarly her own. Her keen hazel eyes were fixed upon the face of the  girl before her. Instinctively and immediately she liked Helen Cumberly;  and Helen felt that this strong-looking, vaguely masculine woman, was an  old, intimate friend, although she had never before set eyes upon her.    \"H'm!\" said Miss Ryland. \"I have come from Paris\"--she punctuated many  of her sentences with wags of the head as if carefully weighing her  words--\"especially\" (pause) \"to see you\" (pause and wag of head) \"I am  glad... to find that... you are the thoroughly sensible... kind of  girl that I... had imagined, from the accounts which... I have had of  you.\"...    She seated herself in an armchair.    \"Had of me from Mira?\" asked Helen.    \"Yes... from Mrs. Leroux.\"    \"How delightful it must be for you to have her with you so often!  Marriage, as a rule, puts an end to that particular sort of good-time,  doesn't it?\"    \"It does... very properly... too. No MAN... no MAN in his ... right  senses... would permit... his wife... to gad about in Paris with  another... girl\" (she presumably referred to herself) \"whom HE had only  met... casually... and did not like\"...    \"What! do you mean that Mr. Leroux doesn't like you? I can't believe  that!\"    \"Then the sooner... you believe it... the better.\"    \"It can only be that he does not know you, properly?\"    \"He has no wish... to know me... properly; and I have no desire... to  cultivate... the... friendship of such... a silly being.\"    Helen Cumberly was conscious that a flush was rising from her face to  her brow, and tingling in the very roots of her hair. She was indignant  with herself and turned, aside, bending over her table in order to  conceal this ill-timed embarrassment from her visitor.    \"Poor Mr. Leroux!\" she said, speaking very rapidly; \"I think it awfully  good of him, and sporty, to allow his wife so much liberty.\"    \"Sporty!\" said Miss Ryland, head wagging and nostrils distended in  scorn. \"Idi-otic... I should call it.\"    \"Why?\"    Helen Cumberly, perfectly composed again, raised her clear eyes to her  visitor.    \"You seem so... thoroughly sensible, except in regard to... Harry  Leroux;--and ALL women, with a few... exceptions, are FOOLS where the  true... character of a MAN is concerned--that I will take you right into  my confidence.\"    Her speech lost its quality of syncopation; the whole expression of her  face changed; and in the hazel eyes a deep concern might be read.    \"My dear,\" she stood up, crossed to Helen's side, and rested her  artistic looking hands upon the girl's shoulder. \"Harry Leroux stands  upon the brink of a great tragedy--a life's tragedy!\"    Helen was trembling slightly again.    \"Oh, I know!\" she whispered--\"I know--\"    \"You know?\"    There was surprise in Miss Ryland's voice.    \"Yes, I have seen them--watched them--and I know that the police  think\"...    \"Police! What are you talking about--the police?\"    Helen looked up with a troubled face.    \"The murder!\" she began...    Miss Ryland dropped into a chair which, fortunately, stood close behind  her, with a face suddenly set in an expression of horror. She began to  understand, now, a certain restraint, a certain ominous shadow, which  she had perceived, or thought she had perceived, in the atmosphere of  this home, and in the manner of its occupants.    \"My dear girl,\" she began, and the old nervous, jerky manner showed  itself again, momentarily,--\"remember that... I left Paris by ... the  first train, this morning, and have simply been... traveling right up to  the present moment.\"...    \"Then you have not heard? You don't know that a--murder--has been  committed?\"    \"MURDER! Not--not\"...    \"Not any one connected with Mr. Leroux; no, thank God! but it was done  in his flat.\"...    Miss Ryland brushed a whisk of straight hair back from her brow with a  rough and ungraceful movement.    \"My dear,\" she began, taking a French telegraphic form from her pocket,  \"you see this message? It's one which reached me at an unearthly hour  this morning from Harry Leroux. It was addressed to his wife at my  studio; therefore, as her friend, I opened it. Mira Leroux has actually  visited me there twice since her marriage--\"    \"Twice!\" Helen rose slowly to her feet,"]]]
