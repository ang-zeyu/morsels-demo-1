Some of them had turbans,  pink or lemon yellow, or white skull caps, and there were also  Egyptian officials and soldiers in white uniform and red turbash, in  white launches that raced about through the green water, cutting a great  dash of white with their bows; there was colour enough, and movement and  sun galore.    [Illustration]    I suppose these \"ragged rocks and flinty spires\" are the rocks that  inspired the Pipe-Major with the cheery farewell to \"The Barren Rocks of  Aden\"--here they are the rocks you see from Aden--everyone knows the  tune.    7th October.--The lady artist and I compared sketches. We both worship  Whistler, and various writers we agree about, but I fear we are only in  sympathy so far. I gathered from her to-night that I ought to study  native character in India, for our countrymen in India had no  picturesqueness, no art about them, and to associate with them one had  better be at home. I felt saddened and went on deck and saw the people  she called \"Anglo-Indians\" (more than two-thirds Scots, Irish, Cornish,  and Welsh, with a negligible fraction of possible Angles) all lying  like dead men in rows, with no side or show about them as they lay; some  in contorted positions, with here and there a powerful limb or well  rounded northern head showing in the half dark. Rulers of the Indian  Empire, by Odin! or Jove! damp and hot, and in the dark, in a strong  draught, without a pick of gold lace, prostrate, sweating uncomfortably,  sleeping; and travelling as their innumerable predecessors have ever  travelled, from the North to rule the South.    [Illustration]    They may be inartistic, but they look mighty touching, pathetic, and  wonderful, not only the individual whose legs you step over but that  almighty race combine--whatever you call it[4]--which he represents....  Ladies were stealing to their lairs in the zereba on deck, and in the  music room; they look quite Eastern, all muffled up in tea gowns and  gauzy draperies. The music room has only recently been reserved for them  at night; a mere man who had camped there with wife and child did not  know of the change; and Mrs Deputy-Commissioner told us they were all  lying out there in the dark when the man entered in pyjamas and had  stepped over a dozen prostrate forms when Mrs D.-C. said incisively, \"We  are all ladies here,\" and he murmured \"Good Lord,\" and his retreat was  rapid--what a scare he had!    [4] British or English.       .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    [Illustration]    Only one more day's dull reckoning and we will be ashore. I expect  everyone is getting rather sick of the crowded life. A fancy dress ball  pulled through last night. Most ingenious dresses were made up, and  prizes were given to the best. All those in fancy dress formed up and  walked past the judges in single file. There were pretty much the usual  stock costumes, and nothing original amongst the ladies. The very  black-eyed belle with red cheeks wore a mantilla of course, and gripped  a fan and had a camellia in her hair, and was called Andalusian,  but her walk and expression were \"made in England\"--a Spanish  girl's expression and walk can't be got up in a day or two.  The-most-beautiful-lady-in-the-ship was--upon my word, I don't know what  her dress was called, something of the \"Incroyable\" period; whatever it  was called, she carried it well and could walk, the rest merely toddled.  She is Australian, still, I'd have given her First Prize. The lady who  did get it, was really very pretty, and dressed as a white Watteau or  Dresden shepherdess. Amongst the men \"The British Tourist\" was  perfection--answered all requirements, and suggested the tourist of old  and the tourist of to-day; he had check trousers, chop whiskers, a sun  hat, umbrella, blue spectacles, and the dash of red Baedeker for colour.  Then an Assistant-Commissioner, an Irishman, was splendidly got up. I'd  noticed he had been out of sight a good deal lately--he had been sewing  his own clothes, and they were really well made! \"An Eastern Potentate\"  he called himself, or a Khedive, and ran to riot in a jumble of orders  and jewellery and gold chains. Trousers and jacket were pale cinnamon  with scarlet facings and a red turbash, and how well the clothes fitted!  clever Mr B.; he knows so much about many subjects, and can sew! He and  my Judge acquaintance were arguing last night. The Judge is a  Cornishman. When you get a highly educated Cornishman and an Irishman  together, however long they have been in England, and they begin to  talk, it's worth while sitting out. B. explained in soft and winning  words to the Judge that his life was a giddy round of society, long  leave, and high pay, whilst he in the far North led a lonely life of  continuous hard work and no pay to speak of; and the Judge, with equal  if not greater fluency, described B.'s up-country life as perpetual  leave on full pay, a long delightful picnic, and so on and so forth. My  sympathy went with the Judge; I think his life is the least pleasant,  but one had to allow for his greater rapidity of speech and practice in  courts before juries, besides his art studies in Paris. Later R. joined;  he is an advocate in Calcutta and hails from the Hebrides. Then came a  Welsh Major, a gunner. That made a party of an Irishman, two Scots (one  of them anglicised), a Welsh, and a Cornishman, and they discussed  everything under the sun except the Celtic Renaissance: for they spend  their days on the confines of the Empire, and the brain takes time to  make the tail wag.          CHAPTER VIII      [Illustration: B]    Bombay.--I've travelled these three weeks with people who have lived in  India, and I have been brought up on Indian books and Indian home  letters, and in one way and another have picked up an idea of what the  people and the features of nature are like, but I have received only a  very faint idea of its real light and colour. I thought Egypt had given  me a fair idea of what India might be, but nothing in Egypt can touch  what I've seen in these two half days.    Our first view of Bombay from where we lay at anchor a mile off shore  was very disappointing. All there is to see is a low shore and a  monotonous line of trees and houses; the air was warm and damp and hazy,  and the smoke from two or three tall chimneys hung in thin wreaths over  land and water. In our immediate neighbourhood steamers were coaling,  and their dust did not add any beauty to the picture, and the actual  landing is not very interesting; you get off the ship to the wharf in a  big launch, a slow process but quietly and well-managed, and on shore  have a little trouble about your luggage, even though it may be in the  hands of an agent. I'd two or three cab voyages, \"gharry,\" I should have  said, before I got the best part of ours to the Taj Hotel. There a  friend had booked us our rooms before we sailed, and on the morning of  our arrival had very thoughtfully secured them with lock and key, so  that no unscrupulous Occidental could play on Oriental weakness and bag  them before our arrival.    The journeys in the gharry were not entirely successful, and I didn't  get all our baggage till next day, but they presented me with one  astounding series of beautiful pictures, so that my head fairly reeled  with the continuous effort to grasp the way of things and their forms  and colours, things in the street, themselves perhaps of no great  interest but for the intense colourful light.--There is a water carrier;  the sun shines blue on the back of his brown bare legs and back, and  blazes like electric sparks on the pairs of brass water pots he carries  slung across his shoulders. He is jogging along fast, his \"shoulder knot  a-creaking,\" and the water that splashes on to the hot dust intensifies  the feeling of heat and light. Then you catch the flash of silver rings  in the dust on a woman's toes as she strides along, and have the  unfamiliar pleasure of seeing the human form, God's image in brown, and  note the rounded limbs and bust, and the movement of hip and swinging  arm through white draperies, which the sun makes a golden transparency.  What thousands of figures, and all in different costumes or bare skin.    [Illustration]    Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales arrived the day  before we did, so the air vibrates with the salutes from guns, and is  full of heat and curdling smoke, and colour. \"The Prince\" is distinctly  in the air, and we feel glad in consequence that we have arrived in  time to have seen the town at its brightest: from morning to night there  is one scene after another of continually shifting figures and colours,  perfectly fascinating to us new comers.    ... Guns again from the war ships, aimed right at our windows!  Everything jingles, the air is quivering with the sound and light. The  ships in the bay are ablaze with flags, and the sides of the Apollo  Bundar (the landing place of the Prince) are a mass of decorations and  flags. Below our windows in the shadow of our hotel on the embankment,  the crowd of natives in their best behaviour and best clothes move to  and fro making holiday, watching the ships and any ceremony that may  come off in their neighbourhood, for like our own natives they love a  tamasha. They wear flimsy clothes of varied colours, lemon-yellow and  pale rose, white and pale green, and the Southern light softens all  these by making each reflect a little on to the other.    ... There they go again! banging away--good thing there's no glass in  our hotel windows! You can hardly see the shipping now, the smoke hangs  low on the turquoise blue of the bay, and you "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2276"],[0,"The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (#12)"],[1,"in part. But you are callous, and have never known any feelings  but those of subordination to your old unnatural master. Alas, I have  no cause of offence! I have wronged you; and justice must take its  course. Will you forgive me before we part?\"    Mrs. Logan hesitated, for her mind ran on something else. On which the  other subjoined: \"No, you will not forgive me, I see. But you will pray  to God to forgive me? I know you will do that.\"    Mrs. Logan heard not this jeer, but, looking at the prisoner with an  absent and stupid stare, she said: \"Did you know my late master?\"    \"Ay, that I did, and never for any good,\" said she. \"I knew the old and  the young spark both, and was by when the latter was slain.\"    This careless sentence affected Mrs. Logan in a most peculiar manner. A  shower of tears burst from her eyes ere it was done, and, when it was,  she appeared like one bereaved of her mind. She first turned one way  and then another, as if looking for something she had dropped. She  seemed to think she had lost her eyes, instead of her tears, and at  length, as by instinct, she tottered close up to the prisoner's face,  and, looking wistfully and joyfully in it, said, with breathless  earnestness: \"Pray, mistress, what is your name?\"    \"My name is Arabella Calvert,\" said the other. \"Miss, mistress, or  widow, as you choose, for I have been all the three, and that not once  nor twice only. Ay, and something beyond all these. But, as for you,  you have never been anything!\"    \"Ay, ay! and so you are Bell Calvert? Well, I thought so--I thought  so,\" said Mrs. Logan; and, helping herself to a seat, she came and sat  down dose by the prisoner's knee. \"So you are indeed Bell Calvert, so  called once. Well, of all the world you are the woman whom I have  longed and travailed the most to see. But you were invisible; a being  to be heard of, not seen.\"    \"There have been days, madam,\" returned she, \"when I was to be seen,  and when there were few to be seen like me. But since that time there  have indeed been days on which I was not to be seen. My crimes have  been great, but my sufferings have been greater. So great that neither  you nor the world can ever either know or conceive them. I hope they  will be taken into account by the Most High. Mine have been crimes of  utter desperation. But whom am I speaking to? You had better leave me  to myself, mistress.\"    \"Leave you to yourself? That I will be loth to do till you tell me  where you were that night my young master was murdered.\"    \"Where the devil would, I was! Will that suffice you? Ah, it was a vile  action! A night to be remembered that was! Won't you be going? I want  to trust my daughter with a commission.\"    \"No, Mrs. Calvert, you and I part not till you have divulged that  mystery to me.\"    \"You must accompany me to the other world, then, for you shall not have  it in this.\"    \"If you refuse to answer me, I can have you before a tribunal, where  you shall be sifted to the soul.\"    \"Such miserable inanity! What care I for your threatenings of a  tribunal? I who must soon stand before my last earthly one? What could  the word of such a culprit avail? Or, if it could, where is the judge  that could enforce it?\"    \"Did you not say that there was some mode of accommodating matters on  that score?\"    \"Yes, I prayed you to grant me my life, which is in your power. The  saving of it would not have cost you a plack, yet you refused to do it.  The taking of it will cost you a great deal, and yet to that purpose  you adhere. I can have no parley with such a spirit. I would not have  my life in a present from its motions, nor would I exchange courtesies  with its possessor.\"    \"Indeed, Mrs. Calvert, since ever we met, I have been so busy thinking  about who you might be that I know not what you have been proposing. I  believe I meant to do what I could to save you But, once for all, tell  me everything that you know concerning that amiable young gentleman's  death, and here is my band there shall be nothing wanting that I can  effect for you.\"    \"No I despise all barter with such mean and selfish curiosity; and, as  I believe that passion is stronger with you, than fear with me, we part  on equal terms. Do your worst; and my secret shall go to the gallows  and the grave with me.\"    Mrs. Logan was now greatly confounded, and after proffering in vain to  concede everything she could ask in exchange, for the particulars  relating to the murder, she became the suppliant in her turn. But the  unaccountable culprit, exulting in her advantage, laughed her to scorn;  and finally, in a paroxysm of pride and impatience, called in the  jailor and had her expelled, ordering him in her hearing not to grant  her admittance a second time, on any pretence.    Mrs. Logan was now hard put to it, and again driven almost to despair.  She might have succeeded in the attainment of that she thirsted for  most in life so easily had she known the character with which she had  to deal. Had she known to have soothed her high and afflicted spirit:  but that opportunity was past, and the hour of examination at hand. She  once thought of going and claiming her articles, as she at first  intended; but then, when she thought again of the Wringhims swaying it  at Dalcastle, where she had been wont to hear them held in such  contempt, if not abhorrence, and perhaps of holding it by the most  diabolical means, she was withheld from marring the only chance that  remained of having a glimpse into that mysterious affair.    Finally, she resolved not to answer to her name in the court, rather  than to appear and assert a falsehood, which she might be called on to  certify by oath. She did so; and heard the Sheriff give orders to the  officers to make inquiry for Miss Logan from Edinburgh, at the various  places of entertainment in town, and to expedite her arrival in court,  as things of great value were in dependence. She also heard the man who  had turned king's evidence against the prisoner examined for the second  time, and sifted most cunningly. His answers gave anything but  satisfaction to the Sheriff, though Mrs. Logan believed them to be  mainly truth. But there were a few questions and answers that struck  her above all others.    \"How long is it since Mrs. Calvert and you became acquainted?\"    \"About a year and a half.\"    \"State the precise time, if you please; the day, or night, according to  your remembrance.\"    \"It was on the morning of the 28th of February, 1705.\"    \"What time of the morning?\"    \"Perhaps about one.\"    \"So early as that? At what place did you meet then?\"    \"It was at the foot of one of the north wynds of Edinburgh.\" \"Was it by  appointment that you met?\"    \"No, it was not.\"    \"For what purpose was it then?\"    \"For no purpose.\"    \"How is it that you chance to remember the day and hour so minutely, if  you met that woman, whom you have accused, merely by chance, and for no  manner of purpose, as you must have met others that night, perhaps to  the amount of hundreds, in the same way?\"    \"I have good cause to remember it, my lord.\"    \"What was that cause?--No answer?--You don't choose to say what that  cause was?\"    \"I am not at liberty to tell.\"    The Sheriff then descended to other particulars, all of which tended to  prove that the fellow was an accomplished villain, and that the  principal share of the atrocities had been committed by him. Indeed the  Sheriff hinted that he suspected the only share Mrs. Calvert had in  them was in being too much in his company, and too true to him. The  case was remitted to the Court of Justiciary;  but Mrs. Logan had heard  enough to convince her that the culprits first met at the very spot,  and the very hour, on which George Colwan was slain; and she had no  doubt that they were incendiaries set on by his mother, to forward her  own and her darling son's way to opulence. Mrs. Logan was wrong, as  will appear in the sequel; but her antipathy to Mrs. Colwan made her  watch the event with all care. She never quitted Peebles as long as  Bell Calvert remained there, and, when she was removed to Edinburgh,  the other followed. When the trial came on, Mrs. Logan and her maid  were again summoned as witnesses before the jury, and compelled by the  prosecutor for the Crown to appear.    The maid was first called; and, when she came into the witness box, the  anxious and hopeless looks of the prisoner were manifest to all. But  the girl, whose name, she said, was Bessy Gillies, answered in so  flippant and fearless a way that the auditors were much amused. After a  number of routine questions, the depute-advocate asked her if she was  at home on the morning of the fifth of September last, when her  mistress's house was robbed.    \"Was I at hame, say ye? Na, faith-ye, lad! An' I had been at hame,  there had been mair to dee. I wad hae raised sic a yelloch!\"    \"Where were you that morning?\"    \"Where was I, say you? I was in the house where my mistress was,  sitting dozing an' half sleeping in the kitchen. I thought aye she  would be setting out every minute, for twa hours.\"    \"And, when you went home, what did you find?\"    \"What found we? Be my sooth, we found a broken lock, an' toom kists.\"    \"Relate some of the particulars, if you please.\"    \"Sir, the thieves didna stand upon particulars: they were halesale  dealers in a' our best wares.\"    \"I mean, what passed between your mistress and you on the occasion?\"    \"What passed, say ye? O, there wasna muckle: I was in a great passion,  but she was dung doitrified a wee. When she gaed to put the key i' the  door, up it flew to the fer wa'. 'Bless ye, jaud, what's the meaning o'  this?' quo she. 'Ye hae left the door open, ye tawpie!' quo she. 'The  ne'er o' that I did,' quo I, 'or may my shakel bane never turn another  key.' When we got the candle lightit, a' the house was in a hoad-road.  'Bessy, my woman,' quo she, 'we are baith ruined and undone"]]]
