Four or five Mother Carey's chickens  stormed round in circles, shrieking as they swept past the bows. A  rain-squall or two strayed aimlessly over the hopeless waste, ran down  wind and back again, and melted away.    \"'Seems to me I saw somethin' flicker jest naow over yonder,\" said  Uncle Salters, pointing to the northeast.    \"Can't be any of the fleet,\" said Disko, peering under his eyebrows, a  hand on the fo'c'sle gangway as the solid bows hatcheted into the  troughs. \"Sea's oilin' over dretful fast. Danny, don't you want to skip  up a piece an' see how aour trawl-buoy lays?\"    Danny, in his big boots, trotted rather than climbed up the main  rigging (this consumed Harvey with envy), hitched himself around the  reeling crosstrees, and let his eye rove till it caught the tiny black  buoy-flag on the shoulder of a mile-away swell.    \"She's all right,\" he hailed. \"Sail O! Dead to the no'th'ard, comin'  down like smoke! Schooner she be, too.\"    They waited yet another half-hour, the sky clearing in patches, with a  flicker of sickly sun from time to time that made patches of  olive-green water. Then a stump-foremast lifted, ducked, and  disappeared, to be followed on the next wave by a high stern with  old-fashioned wooden snail's-horn davits. The sails were red-tanned.    \"Frenchmen!\" shouted Dan. \"No, 'tain't, neither. Da-ad!\"    \"That's no French,\" said Disko. \"Salters, your blame luck holds  tighter'n a screw in a keg-head.\"    \"I've eyes. It's Uncle Abishai.\"    \"You can't nowise tell fer sure.\"    \"The head-king of all Jonahs,\" groaned Tom Platt. \"Oh, Salters,  Salters, why wasn't you abed an' asleep?    \"How could I tell?\" said poor Salters, as the schooner swung up.    She might have been the very Flying Dutchman, so foul, draggled, and  unkempt was every rope and stick aboard. Her old-style quarter-deck was  some four or five feet high, and her rigging flew knotted and tangled  like weed at a wharf-end. She was running before the wind--yawing  frightfully--her staysail let down to act as a sort of extra  foresail,--\"scandalised,\" they call it,--and her fore-boom guyed out  over the side. Her bowsprit cocked up like an old-fashioned frigate's;  her jib-boom had been fished and spliced and nailed and clamped beyond  further repair; and as she hove herself forward, and sat down on her  broad tail, she looked for all the world like a blowzy, frousy, bad old  woman sneering at a decent girl.    \"That's Abishai,\" said Salters. \"Full o' gin an' Judique men, an' the  judgments o' Providence layin' fer him an' never takin' good holt. He's  run in to bait, Miquelon way.\"    \"He'll run her under,\" said Long Jack. \"That's no rig fer this weather.\"    \"Not he, 'r he'd 'a' done it long ago,\" Disko replied. \"Looks's if he  cal'lated to run us under. Ain't she daown by the head more'n natural,  Tom Platt?\"    \"Ef it's his style o' loadin' her she ain't safe,\" said the sailor,  slowly. \"Ef she's spewed her oakum he'd better git to his pumps mighty  quick.\"    The creature thrashed up, wore round with a clatter and rattle, and lay  head to wind within ear-shot.    A greybeard wagged over the bulwark, and a thick voice yelled something  Harvey could not understand. But Disko's face darkened. \"He'd resk  every stick he hez to carry bad news. Says we're in fer a shift o'  wind. He's in fer worse. Abishai! Abishai!\" He waved his arm up and  down with the gesture of a man at the pumps, and pointed forward. The  crew mocked him and laughed.    \"Jounce ye, an' strip ye, an' trip ye!\" yelled Uncle Abishai. \"A livin'  gale--a livin' gale. Yah! Cast up fer your last trip, all you  Gloucester haddocks. You won't see Gloucester no more, no more!\"    \"Crazy full--as usual,\" said Tom Platt. \"Wish he hadn't spied us,  though.\"    She drifted out of hearing while the greyhead yelled something about a  dance at the Bay of Bulls and a dead man in the fo'c'sle. Harvey  shuddered. He had seen the sloven tilled decks and the savage-eyed crew.    \"An' that's a fine little floatin' hell fer her draught,\" said Long  Jack. \"I wondher what mischief he's been at ashore.\"    \"He's a trawler,\" Dan explained to Harvey, \"an' he runs in fer bait all  along the coast. Oh, no, not home, he don't go. He deals along the  south an' east shore up yonder.\" He nodded in the direction of the  pitiless Newfoundland beaches. \"Dad won't never take me ashore there.  They're a mighty tough crowd--an' Abishai's the toughest. You saw his  boat? Well, she's nigh seventy year old, they say; the last o' the old  Marblehead heel-tappers. They don't make them quarter-decks any more.  Abishai don't use Marblehead, though. He ain't wanted there. He jes'  drif's araound, in debt, trawlin' an' cussin' like you've heard. Bin a  Jonah fer years an' years, he hez. 'Gits liquor frum the Feecamp boats  fer makin' spells an' selling winds an' such truck. Crazy, I guess.\"    \"Twon't be any use underrunnin' the trawl to-night,\" said Tom Platt,  with quiet despair. \"He come alongside special to cuss us. I'd give my  wage an' share to see him at the gangway o' the old Ohio 'fore we quit  floggin'. Jest abaout six dozen, an' Sam Mocatta layin' 'em on  crisscross!\"    The dishevelled \"heel-tapper\" danced drunkenly down wind, and all eyes  followed her. Suddenly the cook cried in his phonograph voice: \"It wass  his own death made him speak so! He iss fey--fey, I tell you! Look!\"  She sailed into a patch of watery sunshine three or four miles distant.  The patch dulled and faded out, and even as the light passed so did the  schooner. She dropped into a hollow and--was not.    \"Run under, by the great hook-block!\" shouted Disko, jumping aft.  \"Drunk or sober, we've got to help 'em. Heave short and break her out!  Smart!\"    Harvey was thrown on the deck by the shock that followed the setting of  the jib and foresail, for they hove short on the cable, and to save  time, jerked the anchor bodily from the bottom, heaving in as they  moved away. This is a bit of brute force seldom resorted to except in  matters of life and death, and the little \"We're Here\" complained like  a human. They ran down to where Abishai's craft had vanished; found two  or three trawl-tubs, a gin-bottle, and a stove-in dory, but nothing  more. \"Let 'em go,\" said Disko, though no one had hinted at picking  them up. \"I wouldn't hev a match that belonged to Abishai aboard.  'Guess she run clear under. 'Must ha' been spewin' her oakum fer a  week, an' they never thought to pump her. That's one more boat gone  along o' leavin' port all hands drunk.\"    \"Glory be!\" said Long Jack. \"We'd ha' been obliged to help 'em if they  was top o' water.\"    \"'Thinkin' o' that myself,\" said Tom Platt.    \"Fey! Fey!\" said the cook, rolling his eyes. \"He hass taken his own  luck with him.\"    \"Ver' good thing, I think, to tell the fleet when we see. Eh, wha-at'?\"  said Manuel. \"If you runna that way before the wind, and she work open  her seams--\" He threw out his hands with an indescribable gesture,  while Penn sat down on the house and sobbed at the sheer horror and  pity of it all. Harvey could not realise that he had seen death on the  open waters, but he felt very sick.    Then Dan went up the crosstrees, and Disko steered them back to within  sight of their own trawl-buoys just before the fog blanketed the sea  once again.    \"We go mighty quick hereabouts when we do go,\" was all he said to  Harvey. \"You think on that for a spell, young feller. That was liquor.\"    After dinner it was calm enough to fish from the decks,--Penn and Uncle  Salters were very zealous this time,--and the catch was large and large  fish.    \"Abishai has shorely took his luck with him,\" said Salters. \"The wind  hain't backed ner riz ner nothin'. How abaout the trawl? I despise  superstition, anyway.\"    Tom Platt insisted that they had much better haul the thing and make a  new berth. But the cook said: \"The luck iss in two pieces. You will  find it so when you look. I know.\" This so tickled Long Jack that he  overbore Tom Platt, and the two went out together.    Underrunning a trawl means pulling it in on one side of the dory,  picking off the fish, rebaiting the hooks, and passing them back to the  sea again something like pinning and unpinning linen on a wash-line. It  is a lengthy business and rather dangerous, for the long, sagging line  may twitch a boat under in a flash. But when they heard, \"And naow to  thee, O Capting,\" booming out of the fog, the crew of the \"We're Here\"  took heart. The dory swirled alongside well loaded, Tom Platt yelling  for Manuel to act as relief-boat.    \"The luck's cut square in two pieces,\" said Long Jack, forking in the  fish, while Harvey stood open-mouthed at the skill with which the  plunging dory was saved from destruction. \"One half was jest punkins.  Tom Platt wanted to haul her an' ha' done wid ut; but I said, 'I'll  back the doctor that has the second sight,' an' the other half come up  sagging full o' big uns. Hurry, Man'nle, an' bring's a tub o' bait.  There's luck afloat tonight.\"    The fish bit at the newly baited hooks from which their brethren had  just been taken, and Tom Platt and Long Jack moved methodically up and  down the length of the trawl, the boat's nose surging under the wet  line of hooks, stripping the sea-cucumbers that they called pumpkins,  slatting off the fresh-caught cod against the gunwale, rebaiting, and  loading Manuel's dory till dusk.    \"I'll take no risks,\" said Disko, then--\"not with him floatin' around  so near. Abishai won't sink fer a week. Heave in the dories, an' we'll  dressdaown after supper.\"    That was a mighty dressing-down, attended by three or four blowing  grampuses. It lasted till nine o'clock, and Disko was thrice heard to  chuckle as Harvey pitched the split fish into the hold.    \"Say, you're haulin' ahead dretful fast,\" said Dan, when they ground  the knives after the men had turned in. \"There's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],[0,"Bulgaria (#12)"],[1," a wild day on the Chatalja hills. Driving rain and mist      swept over from the Black Sea, and at times obscured all the      valley across which the battle raged. With but slight support      from the artillery the Bulgarian infantry was sent again and      again up to the Turkish entrenchments. Once a fort was taken but      had to be abandoned again. The result of the day's fighting is      indecisive. The Bulgarian forces have driven in the Turkish      right flank a little, but have effected nothing against the      central positions which bar the road to Constantinople. It is      clear that the artillery is not well enough supplied with      ammunition. There is a sprinkle of shells when there should be a      flood. Gallant as is the infantry it cannot win much ground      faced by conditions such as the Light Brigade met at Balaclava.        ERMENIKIOI, _November 19._        Operations have been suspended. Yesterday's cold and bitter      weather has fanned to an epidemic the choleraic dysentery which      had been creeping through the trenches. The casualties in the      fighting had been heavy. \"But for every wounded man who comes to      the Hospitals,\" Colonel Jostoff, the chief of the staff, tells      me, \"there are ten who say 'I am ill.'\" The Bulgarians recognise      bitterly that in their otherwise fine organisation there has      been one flaw, the medical service. Among this nation of peasant      proprietors--sturdy, abstemious, moral, living in the main on      whole-meal bread and water--illness was so rare that the medical      service was but little regarded. Up to Chatalja confidence in      the rude health of the peasants was justified. They passed      through cold, hunger, fatigue and kept healthy. But ignorant of      sanitary discipline, camped among the filthy Turkish villages,      the choleraic dysentery passed from the Turkish trenches to      theirs. There are 30,000 cases of illness and the healthy for      the first time feel fear as they see the torments of the sick.      The Bulgarians recognise that there must be a pause in the      fighting whilst the hospital and sanitary service is      reorganised.    There was this check, mainly because, in an otherwise perfect system of  training, sanitation had been overlooked. From a military point of view,  of course, it was almost impossible in any case that the Bulgarian army  should have forced the Chatalja lines without a railway line to bring up  ammunition from their base. It was, however, an army which had been  accustomed to do the impossible. But for the cholera I believe it might  have got through to the walls of Constantinople.    During the latter part of 1913 there was a chorus of unstinted praise in  Europe of Bulgarian strategy. Candidly I cannot agree entirely with some  of the views then expressed, which, to me, seem to have been inspired  not so much by a study of the Bulgarian strategy, as by admiration of  the wonderful heroism and courage of the soldiers. At the outset  Bulgarian generalship was exceedingly good; the reconnaissance phase of  the campaign was carried through perfectly. In that the soldier was  assisted by the perfect discipline of the nation, which allowed a  cheerful obedience to the most exacting demands and absolute secrecy.  But it seemed to me that at the stage when the battle of Lule Burgas had  been fought and won, there was a very serious mistake. (I am not writing  now in the light of the ultimate result, for I expressed this view to  Mr. Prior, of the London _Times_, in voyaging with him from Mustapha  Pasha to Stara Zagora in November 1913.) There was a very serious  mistake in the policy of \"masking\" Adrianople. I have reasons for  thinking that that was not the original plan of the soldiers. Their  strategy was, in the first instance, to deceive the Turks as to where  the blow was to come from. And in that they succeeded admirably. No one  knew where the main attack on the frontier would be made. It was made  unexpectedly at Kirk Kilisse, when all expectation was that it would be  made through Mustapha Pasha and towards Adrianople. But after that  period of secrecy, when the main attack developed, and the Turks knew  where the Bulgarian forces were, it seemed to me it was a great mistake  for the Bulgarian army to push on as they did, leaving Adrianople in  their rear.    [Illustration: AN ADRIANOPLE STREET  Over the roofs, the spiral minaret of Bourmali Jami, white marble  and red granite]    It was not merely that Adrianople was a fortress, but it was a fortress  which straddled their one line of communication. The railway from  Sofia to Constantinople passed through Adrianople. Except for that  railway there was no other railroad, and there was no other carriage  road, one might say, for the Turk did not build roads. Once you were  across the Turkish frontier you met with tracks, not roads.    The effect of leaving Adrianople in the hands of the enemy was that  supplies for the army in the field coming from Bulgaria could travel by  one of two routes. They could come through Yamboli to Kirk Kilisse, or  they could come through Novi Zagora to Mustapha Pasha by railway, and  then to Kirk Kilisse around Adrianople. From Kirk Kilisse to the  rail-head at Seleniki, close to Chatalja, they could come not by railway  but by a tramway, a very limited railway. If Adrianople had fallen, the  railway would have been open. The Bulgarian railway service had, I  think, something over one hundred powerful locomotives at the outset of  the war, and whilst it was a single line in places, it was an effective  line right down to as near Constantinople as they could get. But,  Adrianople being in the hands of the enemy, supplies coming from Yamboli  had to travel to Kirk Kilisse by track, mostly by bullock wagon, and  that journey took five, six, or seven days. The British Army Medical  Detachment travelling over that road took six days.    If one took the other road one got to Mustapha Pasha comfortably by  railway. And then it was necessary to use bullock or horse transport  from Mustapha Pasha to Kirk Kilisse. That journey I took twice; once  with an ox-wagon, and afterwards with a set of fast horses, and the  least period for the journey was five days. From Kirk Kilisse there was  a line of light railway joining the main line. But on that line the  Bulgarians had only six engines, and, I think, thirty-two carriages; so  that, for practical purposes, the railway was of very little use indeed  past Mustapha Pasha. Whilst Adrianople was in the hands of the enemy,  the Bulgarians had practically no line of communication.    My reason for believing that it was not the original plan of the  generals to leave Adrianople \"masked\" is, that in the first instance I  have a fairly high opinion of the generals, and I do not think they  could have designed that; but I think rather it was forced upon them by  the politicians saying, \"We must hurry through, we must attempt  something, no matter how desperate it is, something decisive.\" But,  apart from the high opinion I have of the Bulgarian generals, the fact  remains that after Adrianople had been attacked in a very half-hearted  way, and after the main Bulgarian army had pushed on to the lines of  Chatalja, the Bulgarians called in the aid of a Servian division to help  them against Adrianople. I am sure they would not have done that if it  had not been their wish to subdue Adrianople.    The position of the Bulgarian army on the lines of Chatalja with  Adrianople in the hands of the enemy was this, that it took practically  their whole transport facilities to keep the army supplied with food,  and there was no possibility of keeping the army properly supplied with  ammunition. So if the Bulgarian generals had really designed to carry  the lines of Chatalja without first attacking Adrianople, they  miscalculated seriously. But I do not think they did. It was probably a  plan forced upon them by political authority, feeling that the war must  be pushed to a conclusion somehow. Why the Bulgarians did not take  Adrianople quickly in the first place is, I think, to be explained  simply by the fact that they could not. But if their train of sappers  had been of the same kind of stuff as their field artillery, they could  have taken Adrianople in the first week of the war.    The Bulgarians had no effective siege-train. A press photographer at  Mustapha Pasha was very much annoyed because photographs he had taken of  guns passing through the towns were not allowed to be sent through to  his paper. He sent a humorous message to his editor, that he could not  send photographs of guns, \"it being a military secret that the  Bulgarians had any guns.\" But the reason the Bulgarians did not want  photographs taken was that these guns were practically useless for the  purpose for which they were intended.    The main excellence of the Bulgarian army was its infantry, which was  very steady under punishment, admirably disciplined, perfect in courage,  and which had, I think, that supreme merit in infantry, that it always  wanted to get to work with the bayonet. The Bulgarian soldiers had a  joke among themselves. The order for \"Bayonets forward!\" was, as near as  I could get it, \"_Nepret nanochi_.\" Arguing by similarity of sound, the  Bulgarian soldier affected to believe it meant \"Spit five men on your  bayonet.\" It was the common camp saying that it was the duty of the  infantryman to impale five Turks on his bayonet, to show that he had  conducted himself well. The Bulgarian infantrymen had devised a little  \"jim\" in regard to bayonet work, which I had not heard of being used in  war before. When they were in the trenches, and the order was expected  to fix bayonets, they had a habit of fixing them, or rather pretending  to, with a tremendous rattle, on which signal the Turks would often  leave their trenches and run, expecting the bayonet charge; but the"]]]
