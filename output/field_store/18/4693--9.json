When the last paraffine sheet is laid on, the other  board is placed on top, and the whole bound together, either by wrapping  cords around the same or by clamping them together with bolts.    [Illustration: _Fig. 72._ CONDENSER]    You may now make a hole through the projecting ends of the strips, and  you will have two sets of tinfoil sheets, alternately connected together  at opposite ends of the condenser.    Care should be exercised to leave the paraffine sheets perfect or  without holes. You can make these sheets yourself by soaking them in  melted paraffine wax.    CONNECTING UP A CONDENSER.--When completed, one end of the condenser is  connected up with one terminal of the secondary coil, and the other end  of the condenser with the other secondary terminal.    [Illustration: _Fig. 73._ HIGH-TENSION CIRCUIT]    In Fig. 73 a high-tension circuit is shown. Two coils, side by side, are  always used to show an induction coil, and a condenser is generally  shown, as illustrated, by means of a pair of forks, one resting within  the other.    THE INTERRUPTER.--One other piece of mechanism is necessary, and that is  an _Interrupter_, for the purpose of getting the effect of the  pulsations given out by the secondary coil.    A simple current interrupter is made as follows: Prepare a wooden base  (A), one inch thick, six inches wide, and twelve inches long. Upon this  mount a toothed wheel (B), six inches in diameter, of thin sheet metal,  or a brass gear wheel will answer the purpose. The standard (C), which  supports the wheel, may be of metal bent up to form two posts, between  which the crankshaft (D) is journaled. The base of the posts has an  extension plate (E), with a binding post for a wire. At the front end of  the base is an L-shaped strip (F), with a binding post for a wire  connection, and the upwardly projecting part of the strip contacts with  the toothed wheel. When the wheel B is rotated the spring finger (F)  snaps from one tooth to the next, so that, momentarily, the current is  broken, and the frequency is dependent upon the speed imparted to the  wheel.    [Illustration: _Fig. 74._ CURRENT INTERRUPTER]    USES OF HIGH-TENSION COILS.--This high-tension coil is made use of, and  is the essential apparatus in wireless telegraphy, as we shall see in  the chapter treating upon that subject.          CHAPTER XI    WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY      TELEGRAPHING WITHOUT WIRES.--Wireless telegraphy is an outgrowth of the  ordinary telegraph system. When Maxwell, and, later on, Hertz,  discovered that electricity, magnetism, and light were transmitted  through the ether, and that they differed only in their wave lengths,  they laid the foundations for wireless telegraphy. Ether is a substance  which is millions and millions of times lighter than air, and it  pervades all space. It is so unstable that it is constantly in motion,  and this phase led some one to suggest that if a proper electrical  apparatus could be made, the ether would thereby be disturbed  sufficiently so that its impulses would extend out a distance  proportioned to the intensity of the electrical agitation thereby  created.    SURGING CHARACTER OF HIGH-TENSION CURRENTS.--When a current of  electricity is sent through a wire, hundreds of miles in length, the  current surges back and forth on the wire many thousands of times a  second. Light comes to us from the sun, over 90,000,000 of miles,  through the ether. It is as reasonable to suppose, or infer, that the  ether can, therefore, convey an electrical impulse as readily as does a  wire.    It is on this principle that impulses are sent for thousands of miles,  and no doubt they extend even farther, if the proper mechanism could be  devised to detect movement of the waves so propagated.    THE COHERER.--The instrument for detecting these impulses, or  disturbances, in the ether is generally called a _coherer_, although  detector is the term which is most satisfactory. The name coherer comes  from the first practical instrument made for this purpose.    [Illustration: _Fig. 75._ WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY COHERER]    HOW MADE.--The coherer is simply a tube, say, of glass, within which is  placed iron filings. When the oscillations surge through the secondary  coil the pressure or potentiality of the current finally causes it to  leap across the small space separating the filings and, as it were, it  welds together their edges so that a current freely passes. The  bringing together of the particles, under these conditions, is called  cohering.    Fig. 75 shows the simplest form of coherer. The posts (A) are firmly  affixed to the base (B), each post having an adjusting screw (C) in its  upper end, and these screw downwardly against and serve to bind a pair  of horizontal rods (D), the inner ends of which closely approach each  other. These may be adjusted so as to be as near together or as far  apart as desired. E is a glass tube in which the ends of the rods (D)  rest, and between the separated ends of the rods (D) the iron filings  (F) are placed.    THE DECOHERERS.--For the purpose of causing the metal filings to fall  apart, or decohere, the tube is tapped lightly, and this is done by a  little object like the clapper of an electric bell.    In practice, the coils and the parts directly connected with it are put  together on one base.    THE SENDING APPARATUS.--Fig. 76 shows a section of a coil with its  connection in the sending station. The spark gap rods (A) may be swung  so as to bring them closer together or farther apart, but they must not  at any time contact with each other.    The induction coil has one terminal of the primary coil connected up by  a wire (B) with one post of a telegraph key, and the other post of the  key has a wire connection (C), with one side of a storage battery. The  other side of the battery has a wire (D) running to the other terminal  of the primary.    [Illustration: _Fig. 76._ WIRELESS SENDING APPARATUS]    The secondary coil has one of its terminals connected with a binding  post (E). This binding post has an adjustable rod with a knob (F) on its  end, and the other binding post (G), which is connected up with the  other terminal of the secondary coil, carries a similar adjusting rod  with a knob (H).    From the post (E) is a wire (I), which extends upwardly, and is called  the aerial wire, or wire for the antennae, and this wire also connects  with one side of the condenser by a conductor (J). The ground wire (K)  connects with the other binding post (G), and a branch wire (L) also  connects the ground wire (K) with one end of the condenser.    [Illustration: _Fig. 77._ WIRELESS RECEIVING APPARATUS]    THE RECEIVING APPARATUS.--The receiving station, on the other hand, has  neither condenser, induction coil, nor key. When the apparatus is in  operation, the coherer switch is closed, and the instant a current  passes through the coherer and operates the telegraph sounder, the  galvanometer indicates the current.    Of course, when the coherer switch is closed, the battery operates the  decoherer.    HOW THE CIRCUITS ARE FORMED.--By referring again to Fig. 76, it will be  seen that when the key is depressed, a circuit is formed from the  battery through wire B to the primary coil, and back again to the  battery through wire D. The secondary coil is thereby energized, and,  when the full potential is reached, the current leaps across the gap  formed between the two knobs (F, H), thereby setting up a disturbance in  the ether which is transmitted through space in all directions.    It is this impulse, or disturbance, which is received by the coherer at  the receiving station, and which is indicated by the telegraph sounder.          CHAPTER XII    THE TELEPHONE      VIBRATIONS.--Every manifestation in nature is by way of vibration. The  beating of the heart, the action of the legs in walking, the winking of  the eyelid; the impulses from the sun, which we call light; sound, taste  and color appeal to our senses by vibratory means, and, as we have  hereinbefore stated, the manifestations of electricity and magnetism are  merely vibrations of different wave lengths.    THE ACOUSTIC TELEPHONE.--That sound is merely a product of vibrations  may be proven in many ways. One of the earliest forms of telephones was  simply a \"sound\" telephone, called the _Acoustic Telephone_. The  principle of this may be illustrated as follows:    Take two cups (A, B), as in Fig. 78, punch a small hole through the  bottom of each, and run a string or wire (C) from the hole of one cup to  that of the other, and secure it at both ends so it may be drawn taut.  Now, by talking into the cup (A) the bottom of it will vibrate to and  fro, as shown by the dotted lines and thereby cause the bottom of the  other cup (B) to vibrate in like manner, and in so vibrating it will  receive not only the same amplitude, but also the same character of  vibrations as the cup (A) gave forth.    [Illustration: _Fig. 78._ ACOUSTIC TELEPHONE]    [Illustration: _Fig. 79._ ILLUSTRATING VIBRATIONS]    SOUND WAVES.--Sound waves are long and short; the long waves giving  sounds which are low in the musical scale, and the short waves high  musical tones. You may easily determine this by the following  experiment:    Stretch a wire, as at B (Fig. 79), fairly tight, and then vibrate it.  The amplitude of the vibration will be as indicated by dotted line A.  Now, stretch it very tight, as at C, so that the amplitude of vibration  will be as shown at E. By putting your ear close to the string you will  find that while A has a low pitch, C is very much higher.

In buying dairy stock the farmer generally finds it for his interest to  select young heifers, as they give the promise of longer usefulness. But  it is often the case that older cows are selected with the design of  using them for the dairy for a limited period, and then feeding them for  the butcher. In either case, it is advisable, as a rule, to choose  animals in low or medium condition. The farmer cannot commonly afford to  buy fat; it is more properly his business to make it, and to have it to  sell. Good and well-marked cows in poor condition will rapidly gain in  flesh and products when removed to better pastures and higher keeping,  and they cost less in the original purchase.    It is, perhaps, superfluous to add that regard should be had to the  quality of the pasturage and keeping which a cow has previously had, as  compared with that to which she is to be subjected. The size of the  animal should also be considered with reference to the fertility of the  pastures into which she is to be put. Small or medium-sized animals  accommodate themselves to ordinary pastures far better than large ones.  Where a very large cow will do well, two small ones will usually do  better; while the large animal might fail entirely where two small ones  would do well. It is better to have the whole herd, so far as may be,  uniform in size; for, if they vary greatly, some may get more than they  need, and others will not have enough. This, however, cannot always be  brought about.          [Illustration]    Crossing and Breeding      The raising of cattle has now become a source of profit in many  sections,--to a greater extent, at least, than formerly--and it becomes  a matter of great practical importance to our farmers to take the proper  steps to improve them. Indeed, the questions--what are the best breeds,  and what are the best crosses, and how shall I improve my stock--are now  asked almost daily; and their practical solution would add many thousand  dollars to the aggregate wealth of the farmers of the country, if they  would all study their own interests.    The time is gradually passing away when the intelligent practical farmer  will be willing to put his cows to any bull, simply because his services  may be had for twenty-five cents; for, even if the progeny is to go to  the butcher, the calf sired by a pure-bred bull--particularly of a race  distinguished for fineness of bone, symmetry of form, and early  maturity--will bring a much higher price at the same age than a calf  sired by a scrub. Blood has a money value, which will, sooner or later,  be generally appreciated.    The first and most important object of the farmer is to get the greatest  return in money for his labor and his produce; and it is for his  interest to obtain an animal--a calf, for example--that will yield the  largest profit on the outlay. If a calf, for which the original outlay  was five dollars, will bring at the same age and on the same keep more  real net profit than another, the original outlay for which was not  twenty-five cents, it is certainly for the farmer's interest to make the  heavier original outlay and thus secure the superior animal. Setting all  fancy aside, it is merely a question of dollars and cents; but one thing  is certain--and that is, that no farmer can afford to keep poor stock.  It eats as much, and requires nearly the same amount of care and  attention, as stock of the best quality; while it is equally certain  that stock of ever so good a quality, whether grade, native, or  thorough-bred, will be sure to deteriorate and sink to the level of poor  stock by neglect and want of proper attention.    How, then, is our stock to be improved? Not, certainly, by that  indiscriminate crossing, with a total disregard of all well-established  principles, which has thus far marked our efforts with foreign stock,  and which is one prominent reason why so little improvement has been  made in our dairies; nor by leaving all the results to chance, when, by  a careful and judicious selection, they may be within our own control.    We want cattle for distinct purposes, as for milk, beef, or labor. In a  large majority of cases--especially in the dairy districts, at least,  comprising the Eastern and Middle States--the farmer cares more for the  milking qualities of his cows, especially for the quantity they give,  than for their fitness for grazing, or aptness to fatten. These latter  points become more important in the Western and some of the Southern  States, where much greater attention is paid to breeding and to feeding,  and where comparatively slight attention is given to the productions of  the dairy. A stock of cattle which would suit one farmer might be wholly  unsuited to another, and in such particular case the breeder should have  some special object in view, and select his animals with reference to  it.    There are, however, some well-defined general principles that apply to  breeding everywhere, and which, in many cases, are not thoroughly  understood. To these attention will now be directed.    The first and most important of the laws to be considered in this  connection is that of _similarity_. It is by virtue of this law that the  peculiar characters, properties, and qualities of the parents--whether  external or internal, good or bad, healthy or diseased--are transmitted  to their offspring. This is one of the plainest and most certain of the  laws of nature. The lesson which it teaches may be stated in five  words:--Breed only from the best.    Judicious selection is indispensable to success in breeding, and this  should have regard to every particular--general appearance, length of  limb, shape of carcass, development of chest; in cattle, to the size,  shape, and position of the udder, thickness of skin, touch, length and  texture of hair, docility, and all those points which go to make up the  desirable animal.    Not only should care be exercised to avoid _structural defects_, but  especially to secure freedom from _hereditary diseases_; as both defects  and diseases appear to be more easily transmissible than desirable  qualities. There is, oftentimes, no obvious peculiarity of structure or  appearance which suggests the possession of diseases or defects which  are transmissible; and for this reason, special care and continued  acquaintance are requisite in order to be assured of their absence in  breeding animals; but such a tendency, although invisible or  inappreciable to careless observers, must still, judging from its  effects, have as real and certain an existence as any peculiarity of  form or color.    In neat cattle, hereditary diseases do not usually show themselves at  birth; and sometimes the tendency remains latent for many years, perhaps  through one or two generations, and afterward breaks out with all its  former severity. The diseases which are found hereditary in cattle are  scrofula, consumption, dysentery, diarrhoea, rheumatism, and malignant  tumors. As these animals are less exposed to the exciting causes of  disease, and less liable to be overtasked or subjected to violent  changes of temperature, or otherwise put in jeopardy, their diseases are  not so numerous as those of the horse, and what they have are less  violent, and generally of a chronic character.    With regard to hereditary diseases, it is eminently true that \"an ounce  of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" As a general and almost  invariable rule, animals possessing either defects or a tendency to  disease, should not be employed for breeding. If, however, for special  reasons it seems desirable to breed from one which has some slight  defect of symmetry, or a faint tendency to disease--although for the  latter it is doubtful whether the possession of any good qualities can  fully compensate--it should be mated with one which excels in every  respect in which it is itself deficient, and on no account with one  which is near of kin to it.    There is another law, by which that of similarity is greatly  modified--the law of _Variation_ or divergence.    All animals possess a certain flexibility or pliancy of organization,  which renders them capable of change to a greater or less extent. When  in a state of nature, variations are comparatively slow and infrequent;  but when in a state of domestication they occur much oftener and to a  much greater extent. The greater variability in the latter case is  doubtless owing, in some measure, to our domestic productions' being  reared under conditions of life not so uniform as, and different from,  those to which the parent species was exposed in a state of nature.    Among what are usually reckoned the more active causes of variation may  be named _climate_, _food_, and _habit_. Animals in a cold climate are  provided with a thicker covering of hair than in warmer ones. Indeed, it  is said that in some of the tropical provinces of South America, there  are cattle which have an extremely rare and fine fur, in place of the  ordinary pile of hair. The supply of food, whether abundant or scanty,  is one of the most efficient causes of variation known to be within the  control of man. A due consideration of the natural effects of climate  and food is a point worthy the careful attention of the  stock-husbandman. If the breeds employed be well adapted to the  situation, and the capacity of the soil be such as to feed them fully,  profit may be safely anticipated. Animals are to be regarded as machines  for converting herbage into money.    The bestowal of food sufficient, both in amount and quality, to enable  animals to develop all the excellencies inherent in them, and yield all  the profit of which they are capable, is something quite distinct from  undue forcing of pampering. The latter process"]]]
