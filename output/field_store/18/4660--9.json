It was merely a train of cars drawn by  horses along a track that spanned a series of stone ties. Nor was it  very extensive in length. In fact, it was only three miles long and  probably would not have been built at all if the question had not arisen  as to how the heavy blocks of granite necessary for the construction of  Bunker Hill monument were to be carried from the quarries to the  Neponset River, the point from which they were to be shipped to  Charlestown. Bryant, the builder of the road, had heard of Stephenson's  successful use of tracks at the Newcastle coal mines and saw no reason  why a road of similar pattern could not be laid from the quarries to the  ship landing. If such a plan could be worked out, he argued, it would be  a great saving of time and labor. Accordingly the railroad was built at  a cost of more than ten thousand dollars a mile and it unquestionably  performed the service required of it even if it did necessitate the  expenditure of a good deal of money. Since the grade sloped toward the  river the heavily loaded cars moved down the tracks very easily and as  they were empty on their return the ascent was made with equal ease. All  the year round this quaint railroad was in constant use, a snowplow  being attached to the front car in winter to clear the deep snow from  the tracks.\"    \"I suppose that was the first railroad snowplow, too,\" observed Stephen.    \"I suppose it was,\" his father agreed. \"For some time afterward this  old road with its granite ties was the model from which American  engineers took their inspiration, it being many years before railroad  builders realized that wooden ties were more flexible and made a better,  even though less durable roadbed.\"    \"Were any more railroads like the Quincy road built in America?\"  questioned Steve.    \"Yes, a railroad very much like it was built in the Pennsylvania mining  country to transport coal from the mines at Summit down to the Lehigh  Valley for shipment. An amusing story is told of this railroad, too. It  extended down the mountainside in a series of sharp inclines between  which lay long stretches of level ground. Now you know when you coast  downhill your speed will give you sufficient impetus to carry you quite  a way on a flat road before you come to a stop. So it was with this  railroad. But the force the cars gained on the hillside could not carry  them entirely across these long levels, and therefore platform cars were  built on which a number of mules could be transported and later  harnessed to the cars to pull them across the flat stretches. At the end  of each level the mules would be taken aboard again and carried down to  the next one, where they were once more harnessed to the cars. Now the  tale goes that to the chagrin of the railroad people the mules soon grew  to enjoy riding so much that they had no mind to get out and walk when  the level places were reached and it became almost impossible to make  them. All of which proves the theory I advanced before--that too much  luxury is not good for any of us and will even spoil a perfectly good  mule.\"    Steve chuckled in response.    \"I'm afraid with railroads like these America did not make much  progress,\" he said.    \"No very rapid strides,\" owned his father. \"Nevertheless men were  constantly hammering away at the railroad idea. In out-of-the-way  corners of the country were many persons who had faith that somehow,  they knew not how, the railroad would in time become a practical agency  of locomotion. When the Rainhill contest of engines took place in  England before the opening of the Liverpool-Manchester road, and  Stephenson carried off the prize, Horatio Allen, one of the engineers of  the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, was sent over to examine the  locomotives competing and if possible buy one for a new railroad they  hoped to put into operation. Unluckily none of the engines were for sale  but he was able to purchase at Stourbridge a steam locomotive and this  he shipped to New York. It reached there in 1829--a ridiculous little  engine weighing only seven tons. Before its arrival a track of hemlock  rails fastened to hemlock ties had been laid and as the Lackawanna River  lay directly in the path of the proposed road a wooden trestle about a  hundred feet high had been built across the river. This trestle was of  very frail construction and calculated to sustain only a four-ton  engine and therefore when the seven-ton locomotive from Stourbridge  arrived and was found to weigh nearly double that specification there  was great consternation.\"    \"Did they tear the trestle down and build another?\" asked Steve with  much interest.    Mr. Tolman did not heed the question.    \"Now in addition to the disconcerting size of the engine,\" he continued,  \"the wooden rails which had been laid during the previous season had  warped with the snows and were in anything but desirable condition. So  altogether the prospect of trying out the enterprise, on which a good  deal of money had already been spent, was not alone disheartening but  perilous.\"    \"The inspectors or somebody else would have put an end to such a crazy  scheme jolly quick if it had been in our day, wouldn't they?\" grinned  the boy.    \"Yes, nobody could get very far with anything so unsafe now,\" his father  responded. \"But all this happened before the era of inspectors,  construction laws, or the _Safety First_ slogan. Hence no one interfered  with Horatio Allen. If he chose to break his neck and the necks of many  others as well he was free to do so. Therefore, nothing daunted, he got  up steam in his baby engine, which was the more absurd for having  painted at its front a fierce red lion, and off he started--along his  hemlock railroad. The frail bridge swayed and bent as the locomotive  rumbled over it but by sheer miracle it did not give way and Allen  reached the other side without being plunged to the bottom of the  river.\"    Steve drew a long breath of relief.    \"Did they go on using the railroad after that?\" he asked.    His father shook his head.    \"No,\" he replied. \"Although every one agreed that the demonstration was  a success the wooden rails were not durable enough to last long and the  company was not rich enough to replace them with metal ones. Therefore,  in spite of Allen's pleas and his wonderful exhibition of courage, the  road fell into disuse, the engine was taken apart, and the enterprise  abandoned.\"    \"What a pity!\"    \"Yes, it was, for had New York persevered in this undertaking the  railroad might have made its advent in the United States much sooner  than it did. As it was, once again, like a meteor, the experiment  flashed into sight and disappeared with success well within reach.\"    \"And who was the next promoter?\"    \"Peter Cooper was the next experimenter of note,\" Mr. Tolman answered,  \"and his adventure with railroading was entertaining, too. He lived in  Baltimore and being of a commercial trend of mind he decided that if a  railroad could be built through the Potomac Valley and across the  Alleghany Mountains it might win back for his state the trade that was  rapidly being snatched away by the Erie and Pennsylvania Canal. With  this idea in mind Cooper built thirteen miles of track and after  experimenting with a sort of tram-car and finding it a failure he had a  car made that should be propelled by sails.\"    \"Sails!\" gasped Steve.    His father smiled at his astonishment.    \"Yes, sails!\" he repeated. \"Into this strangely equipped vehicle he  invited some of the editors of the Baltimore papers, and little sensing  what was before them the party set forth on its excursion.\"    \"Did the car go?\"    \"Oh, it went all right!\" chuckled Mr. Tolman. \"The trouble was not with  its _going_. The difficulty was that as it flew along the rails a cow  suddenly loomed in its pathway and as she did not move out of the way of  the approaching car she and the railroad pioneers came into collision.  With a crash the car toppled over and the editors, together with the  enraged Peter Cooper, were thrown out into the mud. Of course the affair  caused the public no end of laughter but to Cooper and his guests it  proved convincingly that sails were not a desirable substitute for steam  power.\"    \"I suppose Cooper then went to work to build some other kind of a  railroad,\" mused Steve.    \"That is exactly what he did,\" was the rejoinder. \"He did not, however,  do this deliberately but rather fell into a dilemma that left him no  other choice. You see a group of men coaxed him to buy some land  through which it was expected the new Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was to  pass. These prospectors figured that as the road was already started and  a portion of the wooden track laid the railroad was a sure thing, and by  selling their land to the railroad authorities they would be enabled to  turn quite a fortune for themselves. In all good faith Cooper had joined  the company and then, after discovering that the railroad men had  apparently abandoned their plan to build, in dastardly fashion, one  after another of the promoters wriggled out of the enterprise and left  poor Peter Cooper with a large part of his money tied up in a worthless,  partially constructed railroad.\"    \"What a rotten trick!\" cried Steve.    \"Yes; and yet perhaps Cooper deserved a little chastisement,\" smiled Mr.  Tolman. \"Instead of making money out of other people as he had  intended--\"    \"He got stung himself!\" burst out the boy.    \"Practically so, yes,\" was the reply. \"Well, at any rate, there he was  and if he was ever to get back any of his fortune he must demonstrate  that he had profound faith in the partly constructed railroad.  Accordingly he bought a small engine weighing about a ton--\"    \"One ton!\"    \"So small that it was christened the 'Tom Thumb.'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22248"],[0,"The Indian Fairy Book: From the Original Legends (#12)"],[1,"of her child's cradle, and she knew that the dog had been faithful, and  had striven his best to save her child from being carried off, as he had  been, by an old woman, from a distant country, called Mukakee Mindemoea,  or the Toad-Woman.    The mother hurried off at full speed in pursuit, and as she flew along,  she came, from time to time, to lodges inhabited by old women, who told  her at what time the child-thief had passed; they also gave her shoes  that she might follow on. There was a number of these old women who  seemed as if they were prophetesses, and knew what was to come long  beforehand. Each of them would say to her that when she had arrived at  the next lodge, she must set the toes of the moccasins they had given  her pointing homeward, and that they would return of themselves. The  young woman was very careful to send back in this manner all the shoes  she borrowed.    She thus followed in the pursuit, from valley to valley, and stream to  stream, for many months and years; when she came at length to the lodge  of the last of the friendly old grandmothers, as they were called, who  gave her the last instructions how to proceed. She told her that she  was near the place where her son was to be found; and she directed her  to build a lodge of cedar-boughs, hard by the old Toad-Woman's lodge,  and to make a little bark dish, and to fill it with the juice of the  wild grape.    \"Then,\" she said, \"your first child (meaning the dog) will come and find  you out.\"    These directions the young woman followed just as they had been given to  her, and in a short time she heard her son, now grown up, going out to  hunt, with his dog, calling out to him, \"Peewaubik--Spirit-Iron--Twee!  Twee!\"    The dog soon came into the lodge, and she set before him the dish of  grape-juice.    \"See, my child,\" she said, addressing him, \"the pretty drink your mother  gives you.\"    Spirit-Iron took a long draught, and immediately left the lodge with his  eyes wide open; for it was the drink which teaches one to see the truth  of things as they are. He rose up when he got into the open air, stood  upon his hind legs, and looked about. \"I see how it is,\" he said; and  marching off, erect like a man, he sought out his young master.    Approaching him in great confidence, he bent down and whispered in his  ear (having first looked cautiously around to see that no one was  listening), \"This old woman here in the lodge is no mother of yours. I  have found your real mother, and she is worth looking at. When we come  back from our day's sport, I'll prove it to you.\"    They went out into the woods, and at the close of the afternoon they  brought back a great spoil of meat of all kinds. The young man, as soon  as he had laid aside his weapons, said to the old Toad-Woman, \"Send some  of the best of this meat to the stranger who has arrived lately.\"    The Toad-Woman answered, \"No! Why should I send to her, the poor widow!\"    The young man would not be refused; and at last the old Toad-Woman  consented to take something and throw it down at the door. She called  out, \"My son gives you this.\" But, being bewitched by Mukakee Mindemoea,  it was so bitter and distasteful, that the young woman immediately cast  it out of the lodge after her.    In the evening the young man paid the stranger a visit at her lodge of  cedar-boughs. She then told him that she was his real mother, and that  he had been stolen away from her by the old Toad-Woman, who was a  child-thief and a witch. As the young man appeared to doubt, she added,  \"Feign yourself sick when you go home to her lodge; and when the  Toad-Woman asks what ails you, say that you wish to see your cradle; for  your cradle was of wampum, and your faithful brother the dog, in  striving to save you, tore off these pieces which I show you.\"    They were real wampum, white and blue, shining and beautiful; and the  young man, placing them in his bosom, set off; but as he did not seem  quite steady in his belief of the strange woman's story, the dog  Spirit-Iron, taking his arm, kept close by his side, and gave him many  words of encouragement as they went along. They entered the lodge  together; and the old Toad-Woman saw, from something in the dog's eye,  that trouble was coming.    \"Mother,\" said the young man, placing his hand to his head, and leaning  heavily upon Spirit-Iron, as if a sudden faintness had come upon him,  \"why am I so different in looks from the rest of your children?\"    \"Oh,\" she answered, \"it was a very bright, clear blue sky when you were  born; that is the reason.\"    He seemed to be so very ill that the Toad-Woman at length asked what she  could do for him. He said nothing could do him good but the sight of his  cradle. She ran immediately and brought a cedar cradle; but he said:    \"That is not my cradle.\"    She went and got another of her own children's cradles, of which there  were four; but he turned his head, and said:    \"That is not mine; I am as sick as ever.\"    When she had shown the four, and they had been all rejected, she at last  produced the real cradle. The young man saw that it was of the same  stuff as the wampum which he had in his bosom. He could even see the  marks of the teeth of Spirit-Iron left upon the edges, where he had  taken hold, striving to hold it back. He had no doubt, now, which was  his mother.    To get free of the old Toad-Woman, it was necessary that the young man  should kill a fat bear; and, being directed by Spirit-Iron, who was very  wise in such a matter, he secured the fattest in all that country; and  having stripped a tall pine of all its bark and branches, he perched the  carcass in the top, with its head to the east and its tail due west.  Returning to the lodge, he informed the old Toad-Woman that the fat bear  was ready for her, but that she would have to go very far, even to the  end of the earth, to get it. She answered:    \"It is not so far but that I can get it;\" for of all things in the  world, a fat bear was the delight of the old Toad-Woman.    She at once set forth; and she was no sooner out of sight than the young  man and his dog, Spirit-Iron, blowing a strong breath in the face of the  Toad-Woman's four children (who were all bad spirits, or bear-fiends),  they put out their life. They then set them up by the side of the door,  having first thrust a piece of the white fat in each of their mouths.    The Toad-Woman spent a long time in finding the bear which she had been  sent after, and she made at least five and twenty attempts before she  was able to climb to the carcass. She slipped down three times where she  went up once. When she returned with the great bear on her back, as she  drew near her lodge she was astonished to see the four children standing  up by the door-posts with the fat in their mouths. She was angry with  them, and called out:    \"Why do you thus insult the pomatum of your brother?\"    She was still more angry when they made no answer to her complaint; but  when she found that they were stark dead, and placed in this way to mock  her, her fury was very great indeed. She ran after the tracks of the  young man and his mother as fast as she could; so fast, indeed, that she  was on the very point of overtaking them, when the dog, Spirit-Iron,  coming close up to his master, whispered to him--\"Snakeberry!\"    \"Let the snakeberry spring up to detain her!\" cried out the young man;  and immediately the berries spread like scarlet all over the path, for a  long distance; and the old Toad-Woman, who was almost as fond of these  berries as she was of fat bears, could not avoid stooping down to pick  and eat.    The old Toad-Woman was very anxious to get forward, but the  snakeberry-vines kept spreading out on every side; and they still grow  and grow, and spread and spread; and to this day the wicked old  Toad-Woman is busy picking the berries, and she will never be able to  get beyond to the other side, to disturb the happiness of the young  hunter and his mother, who still live, with their faithful dog, in the  shadow of the beautiful wood-side where they were born.          IX.    THE ORIGIN OF THE ROBIN.      An old man had an only son, named Iadilla, who had come to that age  which is thought to be most proper to make the long and final fast which  is to secure through life a guardian genius or spirit. The father was  ambitious that his son should surpass all others in whatever was deemed  wisest and greatest among his people. To accomplish his wish, he thought  it necessary that the young Iadilla should fast a much longer time than  any of those renowned for their power or wisdom, whose fame he coveted.    He therefore directed his son to prepare with great ceremony for the  important event. After he had been several times in the sweating-lodge  and bath, which were to prepare and purify him for communion with his  good spirit, he ordered him to lie down upon a clean mat in a little  lodge expressly provided for him. He enjoined upon him at the same time  to endure his fast like a man, and promised that at the expiration of  twelve days he should receive food and the blessing of his father.    The lad carefully observed the command, and lay with his face covered,  calmly awaiting the approach of the spirit which was to decide his good  or evil fortune for all the days of his life.    Every morning his father came to the door of the little lodge and  encouraged him to persevere, dwelling at length on the vast honor and  renown that must ever attend him, should he accomplish the full term of  trial allotted to him.    To these glowing words of promise and glory the boy never replied, but  he lay without the least sign of discontent or murmuring until the ninth  day, when he addressed his father as follows:    \"My father, my dreams forbode evil. May I break my fast now, and at a  more favorable time make a new fast?\"    The father answered:    \"My son, you know not what you ask. If"]]]
