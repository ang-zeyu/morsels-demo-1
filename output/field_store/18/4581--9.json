Keep Moze and Don back; give him  room.\"    Slowly Sounder paced up the ravine, as carefully as if he were  traveling on thin ice. He passed the dusty, open trail to a scaly  ground with little bits of grass, and he kept on.    We were electrified to hear him give vent to a deep bugle-blast note of  eagerness.    \"By George, he's got it, boys!\" exclaimed Jones, as he lifted the  stubborn, struggling hound off the trail. \"I know that bay. It means a  lion passed here this morning. And we'll get him up as sure as you're  alive. Come, Sounder. Now for the horses.\"    As we ran pell-mell into the little glade, where Jim sat mending some  saddle trapping, Frank rode up the trail with the horses.    \"Well, I heard Sounder,\" he said with his genial smile. \"Somethin's  comin' off, eh? You'll have to ooze round some to keep up with that  hound.\"    I saddled Satan with fingers that trembled in excitement, and pushed my  little Remington automatic into the rifle holster.    \"Boys, listen,\" said our leader. \"We're off now in the beginning of a  hunt new to you. Remember no shooting, no blood-letting, except in  self-defense. Keep as close to me as you can. Listen for the dogs, and  when you fall behind or separate, yell out the signal cry. Don't forget  this. We're bound to lose each other. Look out for the spikes and  branches on the trees. If the dogs split, whoever follows the one that  trees the lion must wait there till the rest come up. Off now! Come,  Sounder; Moze, you rascal, hyah! Come, Don, come, Puppy, and take your  medicine.\"    Except Moze, the hounds were all trembling and running eagerly to and  fro. When Sounder was loosed, he led them in a bee-line to the trail,  with us cantering after. Sounder worked exactly as before, only he  followed the lion tracks a little farther up the ravine before he  bayed. He kept going faster and faster, occasionally letting out one  deep, short yelp. The other hounds did not give tongue, but eager,  excited, baffled, kept at his heels. The ravine was long, and the wash  at the bottom, up which the lion had proceeded, turned and twisted  round boulders large as houses, and led through dense growths of some  short, rough shrub. Now and then the lion tracks showed plainly in the  sand. For five miles or more Sounder led us up the ravine, which began  to contract and grow steep. The dry stream bed got to be full of  thickets of branchless saplings, about the poplar--tall, straight, size  of a man's arm, and growing so close we had to press them aside to let  our horses through.    Presently Sounder slowed up and appeared at fault. We found him  puzzling over an open, grassy patch, and after nosing it for a little  while, he began skirting the edge.    \"Cute dog!\" declared Jones. \"That Sounder will make a lion chaser. Our  game has gone up here somewhere.\"    Sure enough, Sounder directly gave tongue from the side of the ravine.  It was climb for us now. Broken shale, rocks of all dimensions, pinyons  down and pinyons up made ascending no easy problem. We had to dismount  and lead the horses, thus losing ground. Jones forged ahead and reached  the top of the ravine first. When Wallace and I got up, breathing  heavily, Jones and the hounds were out of sight. But Sounder kept  voicing his clear call, giving us our direction. Off we flew, over  ground that was still rough, but enjoyable going compared to the ravine  slopes. The ridge was sparsely covered with cedar and pinyon, through  which, far ahead, we pretty soon spied Jones. Wallace signaled, and our  leader answered twice. We caught up with him on the brink of another  ravine deeper and craggier than the first, full of dead, gnarled pinyon  and splintered rocks.    \"This gulch is the largest of the three that head in at Oak Spring,\"  said Jones. \"Boys, don't forget your direction. Always keep a feeling  where camp is, always sense it every time you turn. The dogs have gone  down. That lion is in here somewhere. Maybe he lives down in the high  cliffs near the spring and came up here last night for a kill he's  buried somewhere. Lions never travel far. Hark! Hark! There's Sounder  and the rest of them! They've got the scent; they've all got it! Down,  boys, down, and ride!\"    With that he crashed into the cedar in a way that showed me how  impervious he was to slashing branches, sharp as thorns, and steep  descent and peril.    Wallace's big sorrel plunged after him and the rolling stones cracked.  Suffering as I was by this time, with cramp in my legs, and torturing  pain, I had to choose between holding my horse in or falling off; so I  chose the former and accordingly got behind.    Dead cedar and pinyon trees lay everywhere, with their contorted limbs  reaching out like the arms of a devil-fish. Stones blocked every  opening. Making the bottom of the ravine after what seemed an  interminable time, I found the tracks of Jones and Wallace. A long  \"Waa-hoo!\" drew me on; then the mellow bay of a hound floated up the  ravine. Satan made up time in the sandy stream bed, but kept me busily  dodging overhanging branches. I became aware, after a succession of  efforts to keep from being strung on pinyons, that the sand before me  was clean and trackless. Hauling Satan up sharply, I waited  irresolutely and listened. Then from high up the ravine side wafted  down a medley of yelps and barks.    \"Waa-hoo, waa-hoo!\" ringing down the slope, pealed against the cliff  behind me, and sent the wild echoes flying. Satan, of his own accord,  headed up the incline. Surprised at this, I gave him free rein. How he  did climb! Not long did it take me to discover that he picked out  easier going than I had. Once I saw Jones crossing a ledge far above  me, and I yelled our signal cry. The answer returned clear and sharp;  then its echo cracked under the hollow cliff, and crossing and  recrossing the ravine, it died at last far away, like the muffled peal  of a bell-buoy. Again I heard the blended yelping of the hounds, and  closer at hand. I saw a long, low cliff above, and decided that the  hounds were running at the base of it. Another chorus of yelps,  quicker, wilder than the others, drew a yell from me. Instinctively I  knew the dogs had jumped game of some kind. Satan knew it as well as I,  for he quickened his pace and sent the stones clattering behind him.    I gained the base of the yellow cliff, but found no tracks in the dust  of ages that had crumbled in its shadow, nor did I hear the dogs.  Considering how close they had seemed, this was strange. I halted and  listened. Silence reigned supreme. The ragged cracks in the cliff walls  could have harbored many a watching lion, and I cast an apprehensive  glance into their dark confines. Then I turned my horse to get round  the cliff and over the ridge. When I again stopped, all I could hear  was the thumping of my heart and the labored panting of Satan. I came  to a break in the cliff, a steep place of weathered rock, and I put  Satan to it. He went up with a will. From the narrow saddle of the  ridge-crest I tried to take my bearings. Below me slanted the green of  pinyon, with the bleached treetops standing like spears, and uprising  yellow stones. Fancying I heard a gunshot, I leaned a straining ear  against the soft breeze. The proof came presently in the unmistakable  report of Jones's blunderbuss. It was repeated almost instantly, giving  reality to the direction, which was down the slope of what I concluded  must be the third ravine. Wondering what was the meaning of the shots,  and chagrined because I was out of the race, but calmer in mind, I let  Satan stand.    Hardly a moment elapsed before a sharp bark tingled in my ears. It  belonged to old Moze. Soon I distinguished a rattling of stones and the  sharp, metallic clicks of hoofs striking rocks. Then into a space below  me loped a beautiful deer, so large that at first I took it for an elk.  Another sharp bark, nearer this time, told the tale of Moze's  dereliction. In a few moments he came in sight, running with his tongue  out and his head high.    \"Hyah, you old gladiator! hyah! hyah!\" I yelled and yelled again. Moze  passed over the saddle on the trail of the deer, and his short bark  floated back to remind me how far he was from a lion dog.    Then I divined the meaning of the shotgun reports. The hounds had  crossed a fresher trail than that of the lion, and our leader had  discovered it. Despite a keen appreciation of Jones's task, I gave way  to amusement, and repeated Wallace's paradoxical formula: \"Pet the  lions and shoot the hounds.\"    So I headed down the ravine, looking for a blunt, bold crag, which I  had descried from camp. I found it before long, and profiting by past  failures to judge of distance, gave my first impression a great  stretch, and then decided that I was more than two miles from Oak.    Long after two miles had been covered, and I had begun to associate  Jim's biscuits with a certain soft seat near a ruddy fire, I was  apparently still the same distance from my landmark crag. Suddenly a  slight noise brought me to a halt. I listened intently. Only an  indistinct rattling of small rocks disturbed the impressive stillness.  It might have been the weathering that goes on constantly, and it might  have been an animal. I inclined to the former idea till I saw Satan's  ears go up. Jones had told me to watch the ears of my horse, and short  as had been my acquaintance with Satan, I had learned that he always  discovered things more quickly than I. So I waited patiently.    From time to time a rattling roll of pebbles, almost musical, caught my  ear. It came from the base of the wall of yellow cliff that barred the  summit of all those ridges. Satan threw up his head and nosed the  breeze. The delicate, almost stealthy sounds, the action of my horse,  the waiting drove my heart to extra work.

After a year of painstaking  practice, he invented a contrivance by which the weaker fingers were  allowed to gain strength by usage, while the third finger was held back.  This mechanism was altogether too successful, for, after using it some  time, he found his third finger so badly crippled that he was forced to  give up hope of ever winning fame on the concert stage. What seemed a  catastrophe to him has proven a blessing to the world, for, if he had  spent his life in executing the works of others, he would never have had  the leisure to create his own immortal compositions.    Meanwhile Clara was steadily improving her already remarkable powers.  Besides keeping up her playing, she now began regular study in  composition. In later life the two were to labour together in many  pieces, but even at this time Schumann's interest in her work was great,  and in one of his early compositions (Impromptu, Op. 5) we find him  using a theme of hers as the basis of his own piece.    The eleven-year-old girl was now started upon a series of tours by her  father, who wished to give her some idea of the world, and to let the  world gain some knowledge of her attainments. From Dresden he writes  home joyfully to his wife: \"It is impossible to describe the sensation  that your two little monkeys from the Leipsic menagerie have made here.\"  But the fatherly care and wisdom were not lacking, for he continues: \"I  am anxious lest the honours and distinctions should have a bad influence  upon Clara. If I notice anything of the sort, then I shall travel  further at once, for I am too proud of her modesty, and would not  exchange it for any decoration in the world.\" In the next year the  triumphs were continued at Weimar, Cassel, and Frankfurt. After winning  the approval of Spohr and other competent judges who were above all  envy, she proceeded to Paris, where her father had the proud privilege  of exhibiting her talents to Chopin. In Weimar, Goethe took a deep  interest in the wonderful child, and sent his picture to the \"Richly  endowed (_Kunstreichen_) Clara Wieck,\" as a token of the pleasure her  playing had given him.    As the result of her Parisian meeting with Chopin, she became one of  the best interpreters of that master's works, and gave them to the world  in much the same manner that she did those of Schumann soon afterward.  Usually her work in educating the public was successful. But critics are  not all safe guides, and even to-day we find many unmusical men in  responsible newspaper positions, so it is not surprising to find an  occasional misunderstanding occur. In Vienna, for instance, we find the  influential but self-important Rellstab writing that it is \"a shame that  she is in the hands of a father who allows such nonsense as Chopin's to  be played.\" These strictures did not extend to the performance, however,  and the writer does not fail to acknowledge her marked talent. Fetis  bears witness to the \"lively sensation\" she created on the banks of the  Seine, while along the Danube she won victory on victory. The  aristocracy were eager to admit her to their circle, and the Austrian  Empress named her court virtuoso, an honour never before bestowed on a  foreigner.    Some time before this, she had won the attention and interest of the  young Schumann, if nothing more. He had been at work on a symphony in G  minor (which, by the way, proved a failure and was never published), and  the performance of the first movement in his native Zwickau took place  at a concert given there by Clara, then only thirteen. Even then her  performance was astonishing, and, as Schumann put it, \"Zwickau was fired  with enthusiasm for the first time in its life.\" Schumann was no less  excited than the rest of the town. His letters of that time are full of  expressions that seem to betray a deeper feeling, though he himself did  not become conscious of it until later. \"Call her perfection,\" he writes  to a friend, \"and I will agree to it.\" In a Leipsic tribute, he  inquires: \"Is it the gifted child of genius (_Wunderkind_), at whose  stretch of a tenth people shake their heads, but admire? Is it the  hardest of difficulties, which she throws off to the public as if they  were wreaths of flowers? Is it perhaps mere pride, with which the city  looks upon its daughter; or is it because she gives us the most  interesting things of the most recent times with the least delay? I do  not know; but I do feel, simply, that she has the spirit that compels  admiration.\"    The great poets, too, gave her their tributes of praise. \"They  recognized in this inspiring vision,\" says Liszt, \"a true daughter of  their fatherland. They strewed their pearls of song before her, and  glorified this Benjamin of their race, who, gazing about with inspired  glances and wondrous smiles, seemed like a silent Naiad, who felt  herself a stranger in the land of prose.\"    Meanwhile the love that had been growing in silence between her and  Schumann began to take tangible form. His unspoken passion found  expression in the written rhapsodies addressed to \"Chiarina\" in his new  music journal, the _Neue Zeitschrift fuer Musik_. In a more purely  musical manner, his feelings took shape in such works as his  \"Daidsbuendler\" Dances, the \"Chiarina\" of the Carnival, the F-Sharp Minor  Sonata, the Kreisleriana, the Humoreske, the Novelettes, and the  Nocturnes,--truly an offering of rare beauty, and well worthy to express  the feelings of the inspired lover. They bore witness of his adoration  to all who knew him, and all who were able to listen with understanding  ears. And Clara, too, in spite of high honours and higher friendships,  had already given her heart to the silent man endowed with the deep  spirit of romance and poetry. She was his, in spite of the opposition of  her father, who guarded his treasure with a jealous eye, and would hear  of no marriage unless in the distant future.    It was in 1836 that the two lovers came to an understanding. In the next  summer Schumann made formal mention of his suit to her father. Wieck's  refusal may have been due to his entertaining higher hopes for his now  famous daughter, but at any rate the father found an adequate reason in  the vague and unsubstantial prospects of the young composer. This was a  sad blow, but Schumann tacitly acknowledged its justice, for he soon  began making efforts to better his condition, instead of working only  for the glory of art. Although he tried to resign himself to give Clara  up, he could not do so, and with her consent he left for Vienna in hopes  of giving his music journal a broader field. The effort was not a  success; Schumann found Vienna no less trivial in its tastes than many  other places, and wrote home that people could \"gabble and gossip quite  as much as in Zwickau.\" His sojourn there had one important result in  his discovery of Schubert's beautiful C major Symphony, which he sent to  Mendelssohn for performance at the Leipsic Gewandhaus.    Disappointed in material prospects, he tried to obtain a more honourable  position by getting a Doctor's degree from the University of Jena. \"You  know, perhaps, that Clara is my betrothed,\" he writes to an influential  friend. \"Her high rank as an artist has often led me to consider my own  humble position, and, although I know how modest she is, and that she  loves me simply as a man and a musician, still I think it would please  her to have me seek a higher position in the civic sense of the word.  Let me ask you: Is it very hard to get a Doctor's degree at Jena?\"  Apparently it was not hard when a man of Schumann's fame applied, for in  another letter he writes: \"Everything combined to fill the measure of my  joy. The eulogy is so glorious that I certainly owe you a large share of  thanks for it. It gave me and my friends most sincere pleasure. The  first thing I did was, of course, to send a copy into the north to a  girl who is still a child, and who will dance with glee at the idea that  she is engaged to a Doctor.\"    But Wieck's refusal to sanction the marriage could not be altered. In  fact, his opposition became even stronger and more determined. Finding  any direct appeal of no avail, Schumann was forced to have recourse to  law, and Wieck was compelled to give reason for his refusal before a  legal tribunal. Although Schumann was not rich, yet he possessed some  income from his paper, and his other work brought him enough reward to  enable him to make a home for Clara. Besides these receipts, he had a  small property that gave him an annual return of 500 thalers, and as he  himself wrote: \"We are young, and have hands, strength, and  reputation.... Tell me now if there can be real cause for fear.\"  Nevertheless the case dragged on, and a nature as sensitive as his must  have been deeply mortified by the legal wrangling and the publicity of  the affair. At last a favourable decision was reached, and after a year  of doubt and suspense the marriage took place on September 12, 1840.    Henceforth their life was one perfect union. There could be no happier  marriage in the world than this one, where a man of creative genius was  mated with a woman gifted with the ability and the wish to interpret his  works earnestly and faithfully. They regarded art from different points,  but with the same ideas and ideals. Both were wholly devoted to all that  was true and noble, and both felt the same antipathy to whatever was  trivial or superficial. Together they moved along the pathway of life;  together they won their laurels. \"To admire one or the other was to  admire both,\" says Liszt, \"for, though they sang in different tongues,  their life music made but one noble harmony. The annals of art will  never divide the memory of these two, and their names can never be  spoken separately.\"    And now Schumann's happiness began to take tangible form and show itself  to the world.
