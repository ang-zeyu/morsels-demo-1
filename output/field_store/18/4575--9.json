Pure _fragilis_ and pure  _alba_ are perfectly distinct plants, _fragilis_ occasional, locally  rather common, and _alba_ rather rare within the limits of the United  States. Each species has varieties; the two species hybridize with each  other and with native species, and the hybrids themselves have varietal  forms. This group affords a tempting field for the manufacture of  species and varieties, about most of which so little is known that any  attempt to assign a definite range would be necessarily imperfect and  misleading. The range as given below in either species simply points out  the limits within which any one of the various forms of that species  appears to be spontaneous.      =Salix fragilis, L.=    CRACK WILLOW. BRITTLE WILLOW.    =Habitat and Range.=--In low land and along river banks. Indigenous in  southwestern Asia, and in Europe where it is extensively cultivated;  introduced into America probably from England for use in basket-making,  and planted at a very early date in many of the colonial towns; now  extensively cultivated, and often spontaneous in wet places and along  river banks, throughout New England and as far south as Delaware.    =Habit.=--Tree often of great size; attaining a maximum height of 60-90  feet; head open, wide-spreading; branches except the lowest rising at a  broad angle; branchlets reddish or yellowish green, smooth and polished,  very brittle at the base. In 1890 there was standing upon the Groome  estate, Humphreys Street, Dorchester, Mass., a willow of this species  about 60 feet high, 28 feet 2 inches in girth five feet from the ground,  with a spread of 110 feet (_Typical Elms and other Trees of  Massachusetts_, p. 85).    =Bark.=--Bark of the trunk gray, smooth in young trees, in old trees  very rough, irregularly ridged, sometimes cleaving off in large plates.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds about 1/3 inch long, reddish-brown,  narrow-conical. Leaves simple, alternate, 2-6 inches long, smooth, dark  green and shining above, pale or glaucous beneath and somewhat pubescent  when young; outline lanceolate, glandular-serrate; apex long-acuminate;  tapering to an acute or obtuse base; leafstalk short, glandular at the  top; stipules half-cordate when present, soon falling.    =Inflorescence.=--April to May. Catkins appearing with the leaves,  spreading, stalked,--sterile 1-2 inches long; stamens 2-4, usually 2;  filaments distinct, pubescent below; ovary abortive: fertile catkins  slender; stigma nearly sessile; capsule long-conical, smooth,  short-stalked.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; grows best near  streams, but adapts itself readily to all rich, damp soils. A handsome  ornamental tree when planted where its roots can find water, and its  branches space for free development. Readily propagated from slips.      SALIX ALBA, L.    WHITE WILLOW.    =Habitat and Range.=--Low, moist grounds; along streams. Probably  indigenous throughout Europe, northern Africa, and Asia as far south as  northwestern India. Extensively introduced in America, and often  spontaneous over large areas.         New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Ontario.    New England,--sparingly throughout.         South to Delaware; extensively introduced in the western states.    =Habit.=--A large tree, 50-80 feet in height; trunk usually rather short  and 2-7 feet in diameter; head large, not as broad-spreading as that of  _S. fragilis_; branches numerous, mostly ascending.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk in old trees gray and coarsely ridged, in young  trees smooth; twigs smooth, olive.    =Leaves.=--Leaves simple, alternate, 2-4 inches long, _silky-hairy on  both sides when young, when old still retaining more or less pubescence,  especially on the paler under surface_; outline narrowly lanceolate or  elliptic-lanceolate, glandular-serrate, tapering to a long pointed apex  and to an acute base; leafstalk short, usually without glands; stipules  ovate-lanceolate, soon falling.    =Note.=--Var. _vitellina_, Koch., by far the most common form of this  willow; mature leaves glabrous above; twigs _yellow_. Var. _caerulea_,  Koch.; mature leaves bluish-green, glabrous above, glaucous beneath;  twigs _olive_.    =Inflorescence.=--April to May. Catkins appearing with the leaves,  slender, erect, stalked; scales linear; stamens 2; filaments distinct,  hairy below the middle; stigma nearly sessile, deeply cleft; capsule  glabrous, sessile or nearly so.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; grows best in  moist localities; extensively cultivated to bind the soil along the  banks of streams. Easily propagated from slips.          JUGLANDACEAE. WALNUT FAMILY.      =Juglans cinerea, L.=    BUTTERNUT. OILNUT. LEMON WALNUT.    =Habitat and Range.=--Roadsides, rich woods, river valleys, fertile,  moist hillsides, high up on mountain slopes.         New Brunswick, throughout Quebec and eastern Ontario.    Maine,--common, often abundant; New Hampshire,--throughout the  Connecticut valley, and along the Merrimac and its tributaries, to the  base of the White mountains; Vermont,--frequent; Massachusetts,--common  in the eastern and central portions, frequent westward; Rhode Island and  Connecticut,--common.         South to Delaware, along the mountains to Georgia and Alabama; west       to Minnesota, Kansas, and Arkansas.    =Habit.=--Usually a medium-sized tree, 20-45 feet in height, with a  disproportionately large trunk, 1-4 feet in diameter; often attaining  under favorable conditions much greater dimensions. It ramifies at a few  feet from the ground and throws out long, rather stout, and nearly  horizontal branches, the lower slightly drooping, forming for the height  of the tree a very wide-spreading head, with a stout and stiffish spray.  At its best the butternut is a picturesque and even beautiful tree.    =Bark.=--Bark of trunk dark gray, rough, narrow-ridged and wide-furrowed  in old trees, in young trees smooth, dark gray; branchlets brown gray,  with gray dots and prominent leaf-scars; season's shoots greenish-gray,  faint-dotted, with a clammy pubescence. The bruised bark of the nut  stains the skin yellow.    =Winter Buds and Leaves.=--Buds flattish or oblong-conical, few-scaled,  2-4 buds often superposed, the uppermost largest and far above the  axil. Leaves pinnately compound, alternate, 1-1-1/2 feet long,  viscid-pubescent throughout, at least when young; rachis enlarged at  base; stipules none; leaflets 9-17, 2-4 inches long, about half as wide,  upper surface rough, yellowish when unfolding in spring, becoming a dark  green, lighter beneath, yellow in autumn; outline oblong-lanceolate,  serrate; veins prominent beneath; apex acute to acuminate; base obtuse  to rounded, somewhat inequilateral, sessile, except the terminal  leaflet; stipels none.    =Inflorescence.=--May. Appearing while the leaves are unfolding, sterile  and fertile flowers on the same tree,--the sterile from terminal or  lateral buds of the preceding season, in single, unbranched, stout,  green, cylindrical, drooping catkins 3-6 inches long; calyx irregular,  mostly 6-lobed, borne on an oblong scale; corolla none; stamens 8-12,  with brown anthers: fertile flowers sessile, solitary, or several on a  common peduncle from the season's shoots; calyx hairy, 4-lobed, with 4  small petals at the sinuses; styles 2, short; stigmas 2, large,  feathery, diverging, rose red.    =Fruit.=--Ripening in October, one or several from the same footstalk,  about 3 inches long, oblong, pointed, green, downy, and sticky at first,  dark brown when dry: shells sculptured, rough: kernel edible, sweet but  oily.    =Horticultural Value.=--Hardy throughout New England; grows in any  well-drained soil, but prefers a deep, rich loam; seldom reaches its  best under cultivation. Trees of the same age are apt to vary in vigor  and size, dead branches are likely to appear early, and sound trees 8 or  10 inches in diameter are seldom seen; the foliage is thin, appears late  and drops early; planted in private grounds chiefly for its fruit; only  occasionally offered in nurseries, collected plants seldom successful.  Best grown from seed planted where the tree is to stand, as is evident  from many trees growing spontaneously.    [Illustration: PLATE XXII.--Juglans cinerea.]      1. Winter buds.    2.

Other things are promptly brought, the  coffee being served immediately after, by another set of helpers.  Since all cannot be seated, small tables placed here and there in the  suite of rooms will give the standing ones a chance to set a coffee cup  down now and then.  Candy in tiny reception sticks may be passed with  the cake; or bonbon dishes may be set in unexpected places about the  rooms, where any one who discovers them may nibble at will.    The family waitress, with extra help if needed, should be in attendance  near the dining-room exit, to receive the used dishes and remove them  at once from the scene.  This is a nice point; for a congestion of  dishes in the dining-room spoils the effect of an otherwise  well-managed service.  The maid will also keep the stack of plates,  etc., replenished; and she will carry back and forth from the pantry  the salad bowl and platters for replenishing.    Cutlery is limited to a fork for the salad, a spoon for the coffee, and  a fork or spoon for the ice cream.  The ices may be in fancy individual  shapes, if one chooses to take that much trouble; but the brick,  brought in ready sliced for serving, is always suitable, and easier to  manage.    Much of this is so generally understood that further details seem  superfluous.  The least experienced hostess need not be overanxious  about small points, if the general order is observed; for luncheon  guests are a genial crowd, and nobody notices little mishaps.  I am  assuming that your guests are all very nice people, in sympathy with  you, and aiding you to the extent of their ability to make things  pleasant.  Those who have this sincere disposition need no instruction  in behavior.  Each one's conduct will be guided by her own instinctive  sense of propriety.  One who is habitually polite is not likely to make  any blunders at a luncheon, since there are no rigid conventionalities  to be infringed.    If the luncheon hour is much past noon, the guests should be careful  not to remain too long after, as they might thus be detaining the  hostess from later afternoon engagements.          SUPPERS    A supper is a late evening meal, and may be an entertainment by itself,  or be served in connection with some social event.  A supper is  understood to consist prevailingly of hot dishes, which distinguishes  the supper from the collation--which might be served on similar  occasions--and which is mainly of cold dishes.  The distinction is not  absolute, however.    A formal supper, or banquet, is served _a la Russe_, and resembles the  dinner in its general conduct; but instead of the heavy roast and  vegetables, the game is the conspicuous course, and various  preparations of oysters, lobster, terrapin, etc., crowd the _menu_  card, with salads of all kinds.  Nine o'clock is a fashionable hour for  the sit-down supper.  The supper served at a dance or a reception is  timed to suit the leading features of the evening.  The _menu_ for  these \"crush\" suppers covers the ground of the hot supper and the cold  collation combined, and there are few things within the range of dainty  cookery that are not permissible.    The most \"social\" and enjoyable suppers--with the doctor's  permission--are those that are served an home after the hostess and her  guests have returned from the theatre or opera, lecture or concert.  Tiny biscuit, sandwiches, fried oysters, chicken salad, and golden  coffee, with ice-cream and some superior cake, served like a luncheon,  make a supper easily arranged, and one which winds up a pleasant  evening in a very satisfactory way.          BREAKFASTS    A formal breakfast has little distinctive character.  It differs very  slightly from an early luncheon, except that the viands are more  distinctly breakfast dishes; as, toast, hot muffins, omelettes and other  preparations of eggs, delicate farinaceous foods, _cafe au lait_, etc.  If it is the veritable breaking of the fast the guests must be very late  risers indeed, as 11 o'clock, or even 12, noon, is a fashionable hour for  this so-called breakfast, which is a phase of social entertaining  reserved for the \"leisure class,\" or only at odd intervals possible to  people of active pursuits.  The morning hours are precious to the hurried  man of business, and the care-environed housekeeper; and \"promptness and  dispatch\" is the motto of the breakfast table in most houses.    The _real_ breakfast of everyday life is the meal where we least expect  to meet guests--unless it be some one who is staying at the house.  It is  a rare thing for a friend to \"drop in\" to breakfast, and to invite him to  do so is perhaps the rarest expression of hospitality, and will probably  remain so, while we remain a nation of brain and hand workers.    During the summer vacation, when we pause for a breathing spell, no more  charming hospitality can be offered than a dainty breakfast, especially  in the country.  It may be the preliminary to an all-day house party, or  a picnic excursion; or the breakfast may be the goal of an early morning  drive by carriage or motor, and the hour may be early or late, just as  you please; for is not vacation a period of emancipation from the tyranny  of the clock?  But let not the hour be too early, for tired people are  heavy sleepers; yet not too late either, lest the heat of the sun may  have become too suggestive of the approaching noon-tide; late enough for  weary eyelids to unclose willingly, early enough for the fresh dewy odor  still to cling to the vines on the porch.    The conventional breakfast in town is given very seldom as compared with  dinners and luncheons.  It is peculiarly a holiday hospitality, reserved  until the men are at leisure; for breakfast without the man of the house  would be Hamlet with the prince left out.    There is another significant distinction: the guests are chosen from the  inner circle.  When, on Christmas morning, Mr. and Mrs. A.  entertain Mr.  and Mrs. B. and Mr. and Mrs. C. at breakfast, we infer at once their  intimate friendship and congenial companionship.  One may lunch  impersonally with comparative strangers; one may dine formally touching  elbows with one's dearest foe but one does not of choice breakfast with  any one but a friend, or a friend of a friend--graciously accepted on  trust.  Breakfast is the most intimate breaking of bread; not even the  festive elaboration can make the friendly breakfast seem like anything  but \"playing at\" formality.  The service is essentially the same as it  usually is in that household, except that the children are not at the  table.  The more homelike it is, the better; for home atmosphere is  revealed as at no other meal, and on no other occasion can a visitor be  made to feel so entirely \"one of the family.\"    The guests remain but a short time after a breakfast, chatting in a  leisurely way, but leaving rather promptly.      The problem of the family breakfast is complicated by the modern stress  of business life.  In suburban towns the typical \"commuter\" must flee  away with little ceremony; for the 7:08 will not wait, and the 7:10 is a  way train.  In most families breakfast is on the European plan, so to  speak.  For this very reason, perhaps, the occasional holiday breakfast  is the more attractive.  With no train to \"catch,\" no boat to \"make,\" no  office hours to \"keep,\" no demon of driving work to lash one to the  treadmill, how delightful to be able to breakfast with the serenity of  the genial \"Autocrat\" himself; and how very odd it seems to find oneself  sociably disposed at this unwonted hour!  May it not convey the gentle  admonition that we might be more social every day, if we only thought so?    Psychologically, the breakfast is peculiar.  It is the first commingling  of the day; and whether it be the late holiday feast, or the usual family  gathering, it sets the pace for the twenty-four hours.  A cheerful start  in the morning may give an optimistic momentum for all-day hill-climbing;  or, one may slip dejectedly down hill if leaden-weighted with a \"morning  grouch\" (one's own, or somebody else's).  Even fellow \"boarders\" might  reflect on this, with profit.  Preoccupied with our own affairs, we  forget to be mutually considerate.  We habitually wake to rush and worry,  taking social recreation chiefly at the close of day, when too weary to  appreciate it.  Might it not sometimes be well to get ourselves into a  good humor the first thing in the morning, and then work afterward?  Few  people are of such a happy, self-contained disposition that they do not  need the sustaining influence of other cheerful spirits.  Most of us  would have more of sunshine in our hearts if the first business of the  morning had been to put ourselves in harmony with our fellow-creatures  socially.  And if we cannot do this every day, nor even often, according  to our ideal, we at least doubly appreciate the rare occasions when it  has been possible, and we feel impulsively grateful to the hostess whose  thoughtful kindness has made our holiday so bright at its dawning.  Other  ways of entertaining may be more imposing; none are more delightful.  Bid  whom you will to dine with you, but ask me to _breakfast_.          EVENING PARTIES    This general term includes a variety of social entertainments, and  suggests all degrees of formality, from the stately reception to the  \"surprise party.\"  With a range so varied, classification is not  readily made.  Some features are always present: a host and hostess  always receive; a guest always first pays his respects to his  entertainers, and then mingles agreeably with the throng.  He makes  himself useful in any way that tact and courtesy suggest.  Supper is  served, usually the buffet collation.  It is more formal, and less  confusing, if the guests go to the dining-room--convenient numbers at a  time--instead of being"]]]
