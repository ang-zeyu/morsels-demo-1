He sets more store by that  dog than he'd set by most humans. He's pleased as Punch, every time the  collie hauls down a cup at one of these neighborhood shows. Well, that  dog ain't going to be fit to go to another show, for a year. He ain't  going to be fit to look at, for that long. He's going to be a laughing  stock. His owners won't brag any more about him, neither. They'll be  glad enough to keep him out of sight.\"    The boy, listening with ever-widening eyes, chanced to shift his gaze  to the big bowl of new-mixed dye. And a light broke on him.    \"You--you're aimin' to soak him with that stuff?\" he whispered, in awe  at such combined courage and genius.    \"Uh-uh,\" assented Higham. \"I don't know what color the crimson stuff  will turn the dark part of his coat. But whatever color it is, it'll be  as funny as a box of three-tailed snakes. I've put a glass of ammonia  into the dye, to make it 'set' quicker. It--\"    \"Gee, but you're a wonder!\" sighed the worshiping boy. \"D'ye s'pose  I'll ever git to be as smart as you are?\"    \"It all depends on how you make use of your brains,\" returned Higham,  complacently. \"But I was some smarter than you to begin with. I--\"    \"But--\"    Higham went on, more briskly:    \"I've got this bag to put over his head when I open the stall door.  That'll put him out of the biting business, till it's peeled away from  his jaws, after he's got a real good rubbing. But he'll likely wriggle,  a lot. And I'll need you to sit on his head. Likewise to carry this  bowl and the sponge, while I'm opening the door and getting the bag  over his head. Are you game?\"    \"I sure am!\" breathed the enraptured boy.    \"Come 'long, then. The stuff's ready; and we don't want to waste any  time. Go ahead and see if there's anyone in that end of the stable.\"  Two minutes later, the pair groped their way through the dense gloom,  to Stall Five. They walked with exaggerated care; though the roar of  the storm would have deadened the sound of a cavalry charge. Handing  over the bowl and sponge to his assistant, Higham produced from under  his coat a thick burlap bag with a drawstring at its neck. Then, he  opened the door of the box stall, a few inches and stared in.    By straining his eyes, he could just see the vague outline of the big  collie. The dog arose from a bundle of straw, stretched himself fore  and aft, and walked gravely forward to welcome the visitors who were so  kindly easing his loneliness. He was barely visible, in the dimness.    But there was light enough for Higham's purpose. With practiced hand,  he shoved the bag over the beautiful silken head, as the collie stepped  majestically toward him. Then, deftly, he threw the indignant and  struggling dog to the floor, and bade the boy come in; and shut the  gate behind him.    With the passing of another hour, the rain ceased; and a glory of  afternoon sunlight bathed the freshened world. At about the same time,  the belated collie judge arrived at the clubhouse. Word was sent forth  that all dogs were to be returned to their benches and that the judging  of the collies and of certain other breeds would begin at once.    There was a general hustle and confusion, as exhibitors led forth their  dogs from shelter; benching them and plying brush and chalk and towel  in frantic haste.    Higham summoned Rice and another of the kennel men and bade them bring  forth the Lochaber dogs. Instead of helping them with his task, Higham  himself ran to the top of the clubhouse steps, from which he could  survey not only the benches but also the stables and the lawn between.  There, quivering with hard-held excitement, he stood; with the air of  one who has chosen a grandstand seat for some thrilling event. He wore  a pair of thick gloves. As he had discarded the linen duster which he  had worn during the dyeing process, there was no betraying splash of  color on his severely correct garb.    People were trooping out from the shelter of the clubhouse. With half  an eye, Higham observed these; chuckling at thought of the  everincreasing number of spectators to his rare comedy. Of a sudden,  the chuckle changed to a gasp.    Out through the doorway, and onto the veranda, strolled Colonel  Osbourne, owner of the Lochaber Collie Kennels. With him walked the  Mistress and the Master.    At the Mistress's side paced Lad.    \"It was so careless of us to leave the suitcase at home!\" the Mistress  was saying. \"I don't know how we could have groomed him, Colonel, if  you hadn't come to our rescue by turning that kit bag's heaven-sent  contents over to us. Besides, it gave us the excuse to bring Laddie up  into the house; instead of leaving him all alone in that black stall.  He hates thunderstorms, and--\"    A yell, from somewhere, interrupted her. The yell was caught up. It  merged into a multiple roar of inextinguishable laughter. The Mistress  saw a hundred faces all turned in one direction, The faces were  convulsed with mirth. A hundred derisively wondering fingers were  pointing. She ran to the veranda rail and looked down.    Across the patch of greensward, from the stables, a man and a dog were  advancing. The man was shaking his fist at the world at large and  fairly dancing with rage.    But it was the dog, and not he, that caused the Homeric gusts of  merriment and the gobbling chorus of amazed questions. The dog was a  collie; noble of aspect, massive of coat.    But that same coat vied with the setting sun in garish brilliancy of  hue. Never since the birth of time, had such a beast been seen by  mortals. From the tip of his aristocratic nose to the plume of his  sweeping tail, the collie was one blazingly vivid mass of crimson! He  fairly irradiated flaring red lights. His coat was wet and it hung  stickily to his lean sides, as if he had just come from a swim. And it  was tinted like a chromo of a prairie fire.    Following more slowly to the veranda's edge, Colonel Osbourne had begun  a reply to the Mistress's half-finished speech of gratitude for his  hospitality.    \"I was only too glad to be of service,\" said he. \"That's a grand dog  you have. It was a real pleasure to help in his grooming. Besides, I  profited by it. You see, my Lochaber King was quartered in a muddy  corner under the veranda. So I took the liberty of telling my man,  Rice, to put him in that comfortable big stall of Lad's. I am the chief  gainer by the--\"    His courtly speech became a gurgle of horror. For, his eyes fell on the  ragingly advancing Rice. And, by deduction, he recognized the crimson  monstrosity at Rice's heels as his beloved Lochaber King.    Before the apoplectic Colonel could speak, Lad created a diversion on  his own account. He had been sniffing the air, reminiscently, for a few  seconds. Now, his eyes verified what his nostrils had told him. A  pallidly glaring and shaking man, leaning against the veranda rail for  support, had an oddly familiar scent and appearance to Laddie.    The collie stepped forward to investigate. The nerve-smashed Higham saw  him coming; and thrust out one gloved hand in frightened rebuff.    The flicking gesture was unpleasantly like a blow. As the menacing hand  slapped toward his jaws, Lad caught at it, in wary self-defense.    He recalled this man, now. He remembered he had been bidden to \"watch\"  him. He did not spring at his assailant. But a warning snap answered  the frenzied thrust of the hand. His teeth closed lightly on the  glove-fingers, just as Higham, in fear, jerked back his arm.    The loose glove came away in the dog's mouth.    Colonel Osbourne, wheeling about to demand some explanation of his  kennel-manager, beheld a bare hand as vividly crimson as Lochaber  King's ruined coat.    \"Laddie,\" observed the Mistress, that evening, as she placed on the top  trophy-shelf an embossed silver cup, antique, and nine inches high, and  stood back pride fully, to note the effect. \"Laddie, I know--I just  KNOW,--you'd have won it, even if poor Lochaber King had competed.  But,--oh, I wish I could make head or tail of any of the things that  have happened, today! How do you suppose it all started, anyhow, dear?\"  she asked, turning to her husband for help in the riddle.    \"I'd be willing to bet a year's pay it 'all started' about six feet  from shore in this lake,\" responded the Master, \"and about a fortnight  ago.\"    But he spoke it in the depths of his own guiltily exultant heart.  Outwardly, he merely grinned; and said with vacuous conviction:    \"Laddie, you're a grand dog. And,--if you didn't win that cup from  Lochaber King in one way, you certainly won it in another!\"        CHAPTER IV. Hero-Stuff    Life was monstrous pleasant, for Lad, at the Place. And never, except  in early puppyhood, was he lonely. Never until the Master was so  foolish as to decide in his own shallow human mind that the big collie  would be happier with another collie for comrade and mate.    After that, loneliness more than once crept into Laddie's serene life;  and into the dark sorrowful eyes behind which lurked a soul. For, until  one has known and relied on the companionship of one's kind, there can  be no loneliness.    The Master made another blunder--this one on his own account and on the  Mistress's,--when he bought a second collie, to share Lad's realm of  forest and lawn and lake. For, it is always a mistake to own two dogs  at a time. A single dog is one's chum and guard and worshiper. If he be  rightly treated and talked to and taught, he becomes all-but human.  Because he is forced to rely solely on humans, for everything. And his  mind and heart respond to this. There is no divided allegiance.    One dog in a home is worth ten times as much to his owners, in every  way, as are two or more dogs. Especially if the one dog be such a  collie as Sunnybank Lad. This the Master was due to discover.    On a sloppy and drippy and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23922"],[0,"Dead Man's Land (#12)"],[1,"had seemed so clear in the transparent darkness had  disappeared so easily, and he was staring almost wildly in the direction  where he had seen it last when there was a faint, rustling sound a  little to his left, convincing him that the nocturnal marauder had  passed a pensile bough of a tree that must be sweeping the ground, and  must be close upon the ponies, one of which uttered a low, tremulous,  whinnying sound, and gazing sharply in the direction Mark saw as he drew  trigger the big animal assuming a rampant position in springing upon the  pony.    The silence of the night was broken by a roar, and Mark felt that a  cloud was interposed between himself and the camp visitant which hurled  him violently to the ground.        CHAPTER NINE.    \"SEEN ANY MORE LIONS?\"    Feeling half stunned, Mark rolled over and over, holding on to his piece  the while, and struggled to his feet from amongst the bushes in which he  had involuntarily sought refuge.  His movements took him through a low,  clinging cloud of the smoke of gunpowder, and he heard the rustling of  trampled bushes as what he assumed to be his assailant dashed away.  And  now he grasped the fact that his shot had thoroughly roused the whole  camp.  The ponies were plunging and dragging at their raw hide lariats,  and the oxen were upon their feet, alarmed in the darkness and about to  break away; but Buck Denham, the English driver, and the Hottentot were  yelling at them, and the black forelopers were adding their shrill cry  as they aided in trying to pacify the beasts.    In the midst of the noise and confusion Mark heard his name loudly  uttered, followed by the words, \"Where are you, my lad?  Speak up!\"    \"Here--here,\" he panted.    \"Oh, that's right.\"    \"Not hurt, are you?\" cried the doctor, as he grasped him by one arm, and  he awoke to the fact that his breathless father had seized him by the  other.    \"Speak, my boy,\" he cried.  \"Why don't you speak?  Where are you hurt?\"    \"I don't quite know, father?  Not much; but it sprang right at me and  knocked me back amongst the bushes as it tore away.\"    \"What tore away?\" cried the doctor.  \"What did you fire at?\"    \"I am not quite sure,\" replied the boy excitedly, \"but I think it was a  lion.  I saw it creeping up towards the ponies, and as it reared up to  spring upon them I fired.\"    \"Yes,\" said his father sharply, \"and then?\"    \"I think I must have wounded it, for I heard it dashing away amongst the  bushes.\"    \"Well done, boy,\" cried his father, patting him on the shoulder.  \"But  you are sure you are not hurt much?\"    \"Oh, yes, I am not hurt much, father,\" said the boy quietly.  \"The beast  struck me on the shoulder and knocked me right backwards.\"    \"Then he will be clawed, doctor.  Let's get him into the waggon, and  have a light.\"    \"Yes, by all means.  Who's there?\" cried the doctor, in the darkness and  confusion.    \"Ay, ay, sir!  Me, sir.  Off for a lantern,\" cried the little sailor.    \"Here we are sir,\" cried Bob Bacon.  \"Me, sir, and Peter Dance.\"    \"That's right, my lads.  Take hold of Mr Mark and carry him into the  waggon.\"    \"Oh, Mark,\" cried another voice, \"don't say you are hurt!\"    \"Well, but I am, old chap,\" said Mark coolly.  \"No, I say, don't do  that.  Don't be frightened, father, I can walk.\"    \"Are you sure, boy?\" said the doctor, who had handed the rifle with  which he had come out armed to the keeper; and as he spoke he passed his  hands over Mark's shoulders, fully expecting to feel the moisture of  blood oozing through his clothes.    \"Oh!\" shouted the boy, and Sir James winced, uttering a low hissing  sound the while.    \"It's got him there,\" said the doctor, between his teeth.    \"Yes, it pricks,\" said the boy.  \"It was only when you touched it.\"    At that moment a light appeared from the direction of the first waggon,  and the big bullock driver joined the party, ready to open his lantern  and cast its rays upon the excited little throng, one of the first faces  seen being that of the black guide, who, spear in hand, seemed to become  one of the most animated, as he stood with his eyes flashing and his  white teeth bared.    \"Ahoy!  Light's here, sir!\" shouted the sailor.    \"Bring it here,\" cried the doctor, and the rays of a second lantern came  dancing through the darkness to help light up the scene.    \"Now, my boy,\" said the doctor, \"do you feel faint?\"    \"No,\" said Mark sturdily.    \"I only want to see how much you are hurt.\"    \"It's getting better now,\" said the boy cheerfully.  \"It only aches.\"    \"But I must see where--\" began the doctor, only to be checked by a shout  from Mark.    \"I say, don't!  You are hurting me again.  It's a big thorn, and you  pressed it farther in.\"    \"Is it the beast's claw?\" whispered Sir James.    \"It can't be,\" replied the doctor.  \"It's right on the back of his  shoulder where I placed my hand--yes, here it is.\"    \"Oh!\" ejaculated Mark again, for the doctor thrust his hand inside the  door of one of the lanterns, to display a great thorn about two inches  long.    \"Ah, there's lots more here, sir,\" cried Bob Bacon.  \"Mr Mark must have  been knocked right into these bushes.\"    \"Why, Mark,\" continued the doctor, \"hold up your hands.  They are all  covered with blood.  Scratches.  I don't find anything else the matter  with you.\"    \"No,\" said Mark; \"I don't think there is.  I say, don't make such a fuss  about it.  It makes one look so stupid.  I say, father, I'm very sorry I  fired.\"    \"Sorry!\" said his father warmly.  \"Thank heaven, my boy, you are hurt no  worse.  The brute, whatever it was, must have been tremendously strong,  and struck you down in its leap.\"    \"Well, it did come at me with a good bang, father, just the same moment  that I fired.  Here, who's got my gun?\"    \"Gun,\" said a voice, and the Illaka reached over to thrust it into the  boy's hand.    \"Oh, thank you,\" said Mark.  \"Mustn't lose that.  Here, you catch hold,  Dean.  Then you think I did right in firing, father?\"    \"Why, of course, my boy.\"    \"Here, that will do, doctor.  I think I am all right.\"    \"Well, really, my boy, I am beginning to think so too.  But I will keep  watch the rest of the night with one of the men.  You had better go and  lie down now.\"    \"Oh, no,\" said Mark.  \"It's my watch, and I am going to finish it.\"    \"And I will come and finish it with you, my boy,\" said his father.    \"But he has finished it,\" said the doctor, who had hastily pulled out  his watch.  \"Two o'clock!\"    \"Then it's my turn,\" said Dean quickly.    \"But I can't let you undertake that task now,\" said Sir James.    \"Let me come, sir, along with Mr Dean, sir,\" cried the sailor.    \"No,\" said Sir James.  \"Thank you all the same, my man, I have my rifle  ready loaded.  What has become of yours, Mark?\"    \"I have got it, uncle,\" cried Dean.  \"Give me your pouch and the  cartridges, Mark.  I want to load.\"    \"But where's your piece, Dean?\" said Sir James.    \"Mine, uncle--mine?  I came out in such a hurry that I forgot all about  it.\"    \"Bah!  Well, here's Mark's pouch.  Take it and load.\"    \"Yes, uncle,\" replied the boy hastily.  \"Why, Mark, I only heard one  shot.  Did you fire both barrels?\"    \"Eh?  I don't know.  Perhaps I did.\"    \"Well,\" said the doctor, a few minutes later, as he stood with Sir James  and Dean, \"I don't think that there is any occasion to be uneasy about  Mark.  He can't be injured, or he wouldn't be so calm.  The animals seem  to be settling down again, and that's a sure sign that there is nothing  near to alarm them.  What I wonder at is that we heard no sign from the  bullocks--\"    \"Or from the ponies,\" said Sir James.    \"--Before Mark fired.\"    \"Then I suppose,\" said Sir James, \"that we may all go and lie down till  you rouse us up again, doctor.\"    \"Which I certainly shall if there is any cause.\"    The alarm had not proved serious enough to interfere with the sleep of  the camp, with one exception, and Mark formed that exception, for during  the second watch either Dean or Mark's father went to the waggon as  quietly as possible to look after the injured lad, and oddly enough had  the same report to give, that Mark was sleeping easily and well, while  as soon as each visit had been paid the boy turned over, exclaiming,  \"Bother!  Anyone would think the lion had half eaten me.  I wish they  would not make such a fuss.\"    The last time, when Dean was coming off duty, it was to find his  cousin's eyes wide open.    \"Oh, you are awake now,\" he cried.  \"How are you?\"    \"Oh, all right.  Seen any more lions?\"    \"No; it's been quite still all the rest of the night.\"    \"Father all right?\"    \"Yes; he will be here directly.  I say, Mark, let's look where you were  hurt before he comes.\"    But this was not achieved, Sir James darkening the opening of the waggon  tilt just as the neck of his son's shirt was thrown open, to display a  big blackening bruise upon the boy's right shoulder, and further  examination revealed a small hole where a thorn had penetrated, and some  scratches upon the boy's hands.    \"Are those claw marks?\" said Dean excitedly.    \"Pooh!  Nonsense!\" said a voice which made all look up, to see the  doctor climbing into the waggon.    He too examined the injuries, and exclaimed, \"You are sure you saw some  animal about to attack the ponies?\"    \"Yes, certain,\" said Mark.    \"And you fired at it?\"    \"Well, yes,\" said Mark; \"you heard me, and came.\"    \"Exactly,\" said the doctor drily; \"but are you sure that the beast,  whatever it was, sprang at you?\"    \"I saw it rear up as I fired,\" replied Mark, \"and I felt a tremendous  blow on the shoulder.  Yes: here's the bruise.\"    \"Yes, my boy,\" said the doctor quietly, \"but that is just such a bruise  as would have been made if you had pulled both triggers of a heavy rifle  at once.\"    \"Well,\" said Mark quietly, \"I have been lying awake almost ever since,  and that's just what I've been fancying.  Do you think it was that,  doctor?\"    \"I"]]]
