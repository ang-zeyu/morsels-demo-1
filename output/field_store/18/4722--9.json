The Welland Canal was  completed in 1830.      [Illustration: Two horses pulling a rail car.]  Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, 1830.      Salt-water transportation had meantime been much facilitated by the use  of steam. It had been thought a great achievement when, in 1817, the  Black Ball line of packet ships between New York and Liverpool was  regularly established, consisting of four vessels of from four hundred  to five hundred tons apiece. But two years later a steamship crossed the  Atlantic to Liverpool from Savannah. It took her twenty-five  days--longer than the time in which the distance often used to be  accomplished under sail. In 1822 there was a regular steamboat between  Norfolk and New York, though no steamboat was owned in Boston till 1828.  The Atlantic was first crossed exclusively by steam-power in 1838, and  the first successful propeller used in 1839. The last-named year also  witnessed the beginning of a permanent express line between Boston and  New York, by the Stonington route. The next year, the Adams Express  Company was founded, doing its first business between these two cities  over the Springfield route, in competition with that by the Stonington.      [Illustration: Old Boston & Worcester Railway Ticket (about 1837).]      But all these improvements were soon to be overshadowed by the work of  the railway and locomotive. The first road of rails in America was in  the Lehigh coal district of Pennsylvania. Its date is uncertain, but not  later than 1825. In 1826, October 7th, the second began operation, at  Quincy, Mass., transporting granite from the quarries to tide-water,  about three miles. This experiment attracted great attention, showing  how much heavier loads could be transported over rails than upon common  roads, and with how much greater ease and less expense ordinary weights  could be carried. The same had been demonstrated in England before.  Locomotives were not yet used in either country, but only horse-power.  The conviction spread rapidly that not only highway transportation but  even that by canals would soon be, for all large burdens, either quite  superseded or of secondary importance. In 1827 the Maryland Legislature  chartered a railroad from Baltimore to Wheeling. The projectors, though  regarding it a bold act, promised an average rate between the two cities  of at least four miles per hour. Subscriptions were offered for more  than twice the amount of the stock. The Massachusetts Legislature the  same year appointed commissioners to look out a railway route between  Boston and Hudson River. Also in this year a railway was completed at  Mauch Chunk, Pa., for transporting coal to the landing on the Lehigh.  The descent was by gravity, mules being used to haul back the cars.    In most country parts, the new railway projects encountered great  hostility. Engineers were not infrequently clubbed from the fields as  they sought to survey. Learned articles appeared in the papers arguing  against the need of railways and exhibiting the perils attending them.  When steam came to be used, these scruples were re-enforced by the  alleged danger that the new system of travel would do away with the  market for oats and for horses, and that stage-drivers would seek wages  in vain.    The first trip by a locomotive was in 1828, over the Carbondale and  Honesdale route in Pennsylvania. The engine was of English make, and run  by Mr. Horatio Allen, who had had it built. This was a year before the  first steam railroad was opened in England. July 4, 1828, construction  upon the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was begun. It, like the other early  roads, was built of stone cross-ties, with wooden rails topped with  heavy straps of iron. Such ties were soon replaced by wooden ones, as  less likely to be split by frost, but the wooden rail with its iron  strap might be seen on branch lines, for instance, between Monocacy  Bridge and Frederick City, Md., so late as the Civil War.      [Illustration: Horizontal and verical view of a articulated locaomotive.]  The \"South Carolina,\" 1831, and plan of its running gear.      The first railroad for passengers in this country went into operation  between Charleston and Hamburg, S. C., in 1830. The locomotive had been  gotten up in New York, the first of American make. It had four wheels  and an upright boiler. This year the railroad between Albany and  Schenectady was begun, and fourteen miles of the Baltimore & Ohio opened  for use. In 1831 Philadelphia was joined to Pittsburgh by a line of  communication consisting of a railway to Columbia, a canal thence to  Hollidaysburg, another railway thence over the Alleghanies to Johnstown,  and then on by canal. The railway over the mountains consisted of  inclined planes mounted by the use of stationary engines. It is  interesting to notice the view which universally prevailed at first,  that the locomotive could not climb grades, and that where this was  necessary stationary engines would have to be used. Not till 1836 was it  demonstrated that locomotives could climb. Up to the same date, also,  locomotives had burned wood, but this was now found inferior to coal,  and began to be given up except where it was much the cheaper fuel.      [Illustration: Locomotive, tender and two cars.]  Boston & Worcester Railroad, 1835.      From 1832 the railway system grew marvellously. The year 1833 saw  completed the South Carolina Railroad between Charleston and the  Savannah River, one hundred and thirty-six miles. This was the first  railway line in this country to carry the mails, and the longest  continuous one then in the world. Two years later Boston was connected  by railway with Providence, with Lowell, and with Worcester, Baltimore  with Washington, and the New York & Erie commenced. In 1839 Worcester  was joined to Springfield in the same manner, and in 1841 a passenger  could travel by rail from Boston to Rochester, changing cars, however,  at least ten times.        PERIOD III.    THE YEARS OF SLAVERY CONTROVERSY 1840-1860    CHAPTER I.    SLAVERY AFTER THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE    [1820]    Slavery would most likely never have imperilled the life of this nation  had it not been for the colossal industrial revolution sketched above.  Cotton had been grown here since, 1621, and some exportation of it is  said to have occurred in 1747. Till nearly 1800 very little had gone  from the United States to England, for by the old process a slave could  clean but five or six pounds a day. In 1784, an American ship which  brought eight bags to Liverpool was seized, on the ground that so much  could not have been the produce of the United States. Jay's treaty, as  first drawn, consented that no cotton should be exported from America.  It changed the very history of the country when, in 1793, Eli Whitney  invented the saw-gin, by which a slave could clean 1,000 pounds of  cotton per day. Slavery at once ceased to be a passive, innocuous  institution, promising soon to die out, and became a means of gain, to  be upheld and extended in all possible ways. The cotton export, but  189,316 pounds in 1791, and a third less in 1792, rose to 487,600 pounds  in 1793, to 1,610,760 pounds in 1794, to 6,276,300 pounds in 1795, and  to 38,118,041 pounds in 1804. Within five years after Whitney's  invention, cotton displaced indigo as the great southern staple, and the  slave States had become the cotton-field of the world. In 1869 the  export was nearly 1,400,000,000 pounds, worth about $161,500,000.  [Footnote: Johnson, in Lalor's Cyclopaedia, Art. \"Slavery.\"]    So profitable was slavery to vast numbers of individuals because of this  its new status, that men would not notice how, after all, it militated  against the nation's supreme interests. It polluted social relations in  obvious ways, setting at naught among slaves family ties and the behests  of virtue, influences that reacted terribly upon the whites. The entire  government of slaves had a brutalizing tendency, more pronounced as time  passed. \"Plantation manners\" were cultivated, which, displaying  themselves in Congress and elsewhere, in all discussions and measures  relating to the execrable institution, made the North believe that the  South was drifting toward barbarism. This was an exaggeration, yet  everyone knew that schools in the South were rare and poor, and thought  and speech little free as compared with the same in the North. Political  power, like the slaves, was in the hands of a few great barons, totally  merciless toward even southerners who differed from them. It is of course  not meant that virtue, kindliness, intelligence, and fair-mindedness  were ever wanting in that section, but they flourished in spite of the  slave-system.    Economically slavery was an equal evil, taking as was the superficial  evidence to the contrary. No cruelty could make the slave work like a  free man, while his power to consume was enormous. Infants, aged, and  weak had to be supported by the owner. Even the best slaves were  improvident. Everywhere slave labor tended to banish free. Upon slave  soil scarcely an immigrant could be led to set foot. Poor whites grew  steadily poorer, their lot often more wretched than that of slaves.  Invention, care, forethought were as good as unknown among them. Slave  labor proved incompetent even for agriculture, impoverishing the richest  soil in comparatively few years, whence the perpetual impulse of the  slave-owners to acquire new territory. The dishonesty of blacks and the  danger of slave insurrections made property insecure, at the same time  that the system diminished in every community the number of its natural  defenders. The result was that the South, the superior of the North in  natural resources, was, by 1800, rapidly becoming the inferior in every  single element of prosperity.

Of the birds which find place in the list only those are described  which have not been mentioned in the essay on the common birds of  the Western Himalayas.    Short accounts of all the birds that follow which are not described  in this chapter are to be found in the previous one.      THE CORVIDAE OR CROW FAMILY    1. _Corvus macrorhynchus_. The jungle-crow or Indian corby.    2. _Dendrocitta himalayensis_. The Himalayan tree-pie. Abundant.    3. _Graculus eremita_. The red-billed chough. In summer this species  is not usually found much below elevations of 11,000 feet above the  sea-level.    4. _Pyrrhocorax alpinus_. The yellow-billed chough. In summer this  species is not usually seen at elevations below 11,000 feet.    5. _Garrulus bispecularis_. The Himalayan jay. Not so abundant as  in the Western Himalayas.    6. _Parus monticola_. The green-backed tit. A common bird. Very  abundant round about Darjeeling.    7. _Machlolophus spilonotus_. The black-spotted yellow tit. This is  very like _M. xanthogenys_ (the yellow-cheeked tit), which it  replaces in the Eastern Himalayas. It is distinguished by having the  forehead bright yellow instead of black as in the yellow-cheeked  species. It is not very common.    8. _AEgithaliscus erythrocephalus_. The red-headed tit. Very common  at Darjeeling.    9. _Parus atriceps_. The Indian grey tit.      THE CRATEROPODIDAE OR BABBLER FAMILY    Since most species of babblers are notoriously birds of limited  distribution, it is not surprising that the kinds common in the  Eastern Himalayas should not be the same as those that are abundant  west of Nepal.    10. _Garrulax leucolophus_. The Himalayan white-crested  laughing-thrush. This is the Eastern counterpart of the  white-throated laughing-thrush (_Garrulax albigularis_). This  species has a large white crest. It goes about in flocks of about  a score. The members of the flock scream and chatter and make  discordant sounds which some might deem to resemble laughter.    11. _Ianthocincla ocellata_. The white-spotted laughing-thrush.  This is the Eastern counterpart of _Ianthocincla rufigularis_. It  has no white in the throat, and the upper plumage is spotted with  white. It is found only at high elevations in summer.    12. _Trochalopterum chrysopterum_. The eastern yellow-winged  laughing-thrush. This is perhaps the most common bird about  Darjeeling. Parties hop about the roads picking up unconsidered  trifles.    The forehead is grey, as is much of the remaining plumage. The back  of the head is bright chestnut. The throat is chestnut-brown. The  wings are chestnut and bright yellow.    13. _Trochalopterum squamatum_. The blue-winged laughing-thrush.  This is another common bird. Like all its clan it goes about in flocks.  Its wings are chestnut and blue.    14. _Grammatophila striata_. The striated laughing-thrush. A common  bird, but as it keeps to dense foliage it is heard more often than  seen. Of its curious cries Jerdon likens one to the clucking of a  hen which has just laid an egg. The tail is chestnut. The rest of  the plumage is umber brown, but every feather has a white streak along  the middle. These white streaks give the bird the striated appearance  from which it obtains its name.    15. _Pomatorhinus erythrogenys_. The rusty-cheeked  scimitar-babbler.    16. _Pomatorhinus schisticeps_. The slaty-headed scimitar-babbler.  This is easily distinguished from the foregoing species by its  conspicuous white eyebrow.    17. _Alcippe nepalensis_. The Nepal babbler or quaker-thrush. This  is a bird smaller than a sparrow. As its popular name indicates, it  is clothed in homely brown; but it has a conspicuous ring of white  feathers round the eye and a black line on each side of the head,  beginning from the eye. It is very common about Darjeeling. It feeds  in trees and bushes, often descending to the ground. It utters a low  twittering call.    18. _Stachyrhis nigriceps_. The black-throated babbler or  wren-babbler. This is another small bird. Its general hue is olive  brown. The throat is black, as is the head, but the latter has white  streaks.    It is common about Darjeeling and goes about in flocks that keep to  trees.    19. _Stachyrhidopsis ruficeps_. The red-headed babbler or  wren-babbler. Another small bird with habits similar to the last.    An olive-brown bird with a chestnut-red cap. The lower parts are  reddish yellow.    20. _Myiophoneus temmincki_. The Himalayan whistling-thrush. Common  at Darjeeling.    21. _Lioptila capistrata_. The black-headed sibia, one of the most  abundant birds about Darjeeling.    22. _Actinodura egertoni_. The rufous bar-wing. A bird about the size  of a bulbul. It associates in small flocks which never leave the trees.  Common about Darjeeling. A reddish brown bird, with a crest. There  is a black bar in the wing.    23. _Zosterops palpebrosa_. The Indian white-eye.    24. _Siva cyanuroptera_. The blue-winged siva or hill-tit. A pretty  little bird, about the size of a sparrow. The head is blue, deeper  on the sides than on the crown, streaked with brown. The visible  portions of the closed wing and tail are cobalt-blue.    This species goes about in flocks and has all the habits of a tit.  It utters a cheerful chirrup.    25. _Liothrix lutea_. The red-billed liothrix or hill-tit, or the  Pekin-robin. This interesting bird forms the subject of a separate  essay.    26. _Ixulus flavicollis_. The yellow-naped ixulus. A small tit-like  bird with a crest. Like tits these birds associate in small flocks,  which move about amid the foliage uttering a continual twittering.    Brown above, pale yellow below. Chin and throat white. Back of neck  rusty yellow. This colour is continued in a demi-collar round the  sides of the neck. Common about Darjeeling.    27. _Yuhina gularis_. The striped-throated yuhina. Another tiny bird  with all the habits of the tits. A flock of dull-brown birds, about  the size of sparrows, having the chin and throat streaked with black,  are likely to be striped-throated yuhinas.    28. _Minla igneitincta_. The red-tailed minla or hill-tit. This  tit-like babbler is often seen in company with the true tits, which  it resembles in habits and size. The head is black with a white eyebrow.  The wings and tail are black and crimson. The rest of the upper plumage  is yellowish olive. The throat is white, and the remainder of the  lower plumage is bright yellow.      NOTE ON THE TITS AND SMALL BABBLERS    Tits are small birds, smaller than sparrows, which usually go about  in flocks. They spend most of their lives in trees. In seeking for  insects, on which they feed largely, they often hang upside down from  a branch. All tits have these habits; but all birds of these habits  are not tits. Thus the following of the babblers described above have  all the habits of tits: the white-eye, the black-throated babbler,  the red-headed babbler, the blue-winged siva, the yellow-naped  ixulus, the striped-throated yuhina, and the red-tailed minla.    The above are all birds of distinctive colouring and may be easily  distinguished.    Other small birds which are neither tits nor babblers go about in  flocks, as, for example, nuthatches, but these other birds differ  in shape and habits from babblers and tits, so that no one is likely  to confound them with the smaller Corvidae or Crateropodidae.      29. _Molpastes leucogenys_. The white-cheeked bulbul. Common below  elevations of 5000 feet.    30. _Hypsipetes psaroides_. The Himalayan black bulbul. Not very  common.    31. _Alcurus striatus_. The striated green bulbul. Upper plumage  olive-green with yellow streaks. Cheeks dark brown, streaked with  pale yellow. Chin and throat yellow, with dark spots on throat. Patch  under tail bright yellow.    Striated green bulbuls go about in flocks which keep to the tops of  trees. They utter a mellow warbling note. They are abundant about  Darjeeling.      THE SITTIDAE OR NUTHATCH FAMILY    32. _Sitta himalayensis_. Very abundant in the neighbourhood of  Darjeeling.      THE DICRURIDAE OR DRONGO FAMILY    33. _Dicrurus longicaudatus_. The Indian Ashy Drongo.      THE CERTHIIDAE OR WREN FAMILY    34. _Certhia discolor_. The Sikhim tree-creeper. This species  displaces the Himalayan tree-creeper in the Eastern Himalayas. The  two species are similar in appearance.    35. _Pneopyga squamata_. The scaly-breasted wren. In shape and size  this is very like the wren of England, but its upper plumage is not  barred with black, as in the English species.    It is fairly common about Darjeeling, but is of retiring habits.      THE SYLVIIDAE OR WARBLER FAMILY    36. _Abrornis superciliaris_. The yellow-bellied  flycatcher-warbler.    A tiny bird about the size of a wren. The head is grey and the remainder  of the upper plumage brownish yellow. The eyebrow is white, as are  the chin, throat, and upper breast: the remainder of the lower plumage  is bright yellow.    37. _Suya atrigularis_. The black-throated hill-warbler. The upper  plumage is olive brown, darkest on the head. The chin, throat, breast,  and upper abdomen are black.      THE LANIIDAE OR SHRIKE FAMILY    38. _Lanius tephronotus_. The grey-backed shrike.    39. _Pericrocotus brevirostris_. The short-billed minivet. Very  common about Darjeeling.    40. _Campophaga melanoschista_. The dark-grey cuckoo-shrike.    Plumage is dark grey, wings black, tail black tipped with white.  Rather larger than a bulbul. Cuckoo-shrikes keep to trees, and rarely,  if ever, descend to the ground.      THE MUSCICAPIDAE OR FLYCATCHER FAMILY    Of the common flycatchers of the Western Himalayas, the following  occur in the Eastern Himalayas:    41. _Stoparola melanops_. The verditer flycatcher. Very common at  Darjeeling.    42. _Cyornis superciliaris_. The white-browed blue-flycatcher.    43. _Alseonax latirostris_. The brown flycatcher. Not"]]]
