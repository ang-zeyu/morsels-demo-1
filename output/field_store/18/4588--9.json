As a sun-god, and at the same time not the  god Samas, he resembled the Babylonian Merodach, and was possibly  identified with him, especially as, in at least one text, Beltu  (Beltis) is described as his consort, which would possibly identify  Assur's spouse with Zer-panitum. The original form of his name would  seem to have been Ausar, \"water-field,\" probably from the tract where  the city of Assur was built. His identification with Merodach, if that  was ever accepted, may have been due to the likeness of the word to  Asari, one of that deity's names. The pronunciation Assur, however,  seems to have led to a comparison with the Ansar of the first tablet  of the Creation-story, though it may seem strange that the Assyrians  should have thought that their patron-god was a deity symbolising the  \"host of heaven.\" Nevertheless, the Greek transcription of Ansar,  namely, /Assoros/, given by Damascius, certainly strengthens the  indications of the ideograph in this matter. Delitzsch regards the  word Assur, or Asur, as he reads it, as meaning \"holy,\" and quotes a  list of the gods of the city of Nineveh, where the word Assur occurs  three times, suggesting the exclamation \"holy, holy, holy,\" or \"the  holy, holy, holy one.\" In all probability, however, the repetition of  the name three times simply means that there were three temples  dedicated to Assur in the cities in question.[*] Jastrow agrees with  Delitzsch in regarding Asur as another form of Asir (found in early  Cappadocian names), but he translates it rather as \"overseer\" or  \"guardian\" of the land and the people--the terminationless form of  /asiru/, which has this meaning, and is applied to Merodach.    [*] Or there may have been three shrines to Assur in each temple      referred to.    As the use of the characters /An-sar/ for the god Assur only appears  at a late date (Jastrow says the eighth century B.C.), this would seem  to have been the work of the scribes, who wished to read into the name  the earlier signification of Ansar, \"the host of heaven,\" an  explanation fully in accord with Jastrow's reasonings with regard to  the nature of the deity. As he represented no personification or power  of nature, he says, but the general protecting spirit of the land, the  king, the army, and the people, the capital of the country could be  transferred from Assur to Calah, from there back to Assur, and finally  to Nineveh, without affecting the position of the protecting god of  the land in any way. He needed no temple--though such things were  erected to him--he had no need to fear that he should suffer in esteem  by the preference for some other god. As the embodiment of the spirit  of the Assyrian people the personal side of his being remained to a  certain extent in the background. If he was the \"host of heaven,\" all  the deities might be regarded as having their being in him.    Such was the chief deity of the Assyrians--a national god, grafted on  to, but always distinct from, the rest of the pantheon, which, as has  been shown, was of Babylonian origin, and always maintained the  characteristics and stamp of its origin.    The spouse of Assur does not appear in the historical texts, and her  mention elsewhere under the title of Beltu, \"the lady,\" does not allow  of any identification being made. In one inscription, however,  Assuritu is called the goddess, and Assur the god, of the star Sib-zi-anna,  identified by Jensen with Regulus, which was apparently the star  of Merodach in Babylonia. This, however, brings us no nearer, for  Assuritu would simply mean \"the Assurite (goddess).\"                              The minor divinities.    Among the hundreds of names which the lists furnish, a few are worthy  of mention, either because of more than ordinary interest, or in  consequence of their furnishing the name of some deity, chief in its  locality, but identified elsewhere with one of the greater gods.    Aa.--This may be regarded either as the god Ea (though the name is  written differently), or as the sun-god assuming the name of his  consort; or (what is, perhaps, more probable) as a way of writing A'u  or Ya'u (the Hebrew Jah), without the ending of the nominative. This  last is also found under the form /Aa'u/, /ya'u/, /yau/, and /ya/.    Abil-addu.--This deity seems to have attained a certain popularity in  later times, especially among immigrants from the West. As \"the son of  Hadad,\" he was the equivalent of the Syrian Ben-Hadad. A tablet in New  York shows that his name was weakened in form to /Ablada/.    Aku, the moon-god among the heavenly bodies. It is this name which is  regarded as occurring in the name of the Babylonian king Eri-Aku,  \"servant of the moon-god,\" the biblical Arioch (Gen. xiv.).    Amma-an-ki, Ea or Aa as lord of heaven and earth.    Amna.--A name only found in a syllabary, and assigned to the sun-god,  from which it would seem that it is a form of the Egyptian Ammon.    Anunitum, the goddess of one of the two Sippars, called Sippar of  Anunitum, who was worshipped in the temple E-ulmas within the city of  Agade (Akkad). Sayce identifies, on this account, these two places as  being the same. In a list of stars, Anunitum is coupled with  Sinunutum, which are explained as (the stars of) the Tigris and  Euphrates. These were probably names of Venus as the morning and  evening (or evening and morning) star.    Apsu.--The deep dissociated from the evil connection with Tiawath, and  regarded as \"the house of deep wisdom,\" i.e. the home of the god Ea or  Aa.    Aruru.--One of the deities of Sippar and Aruru (in the time of the  dynasty of Hammurabi called Ya'ruru), of which she was the chief  goddess. Aruru was one of the names of the \"lady of the gods,\" and  aided Merodach to make the seed of mankind.    Bel.--As this name means \"lord,\" it could be applied, like the  Phoenician Baal, to the chief god of any city, as Bel of Niffur, Bel of  Hursag-kalama, Bel of Aratta, Bel of Babylon, etc. This often  indicates also the star which represented the chief god of a place.    Beltu.--In the same way Beltu, meaning \"lady,\" meant also the chief  goddess of any place, as \"Aruru, lady of the gods of Sippar of Aruru,\"  \"Nin-mah, lady of the gods of E-mah,\" a celebrated temple within  Babylon, recently excavated by the Germans, \"Nin-hur-saga, lady of the  gods of Kes,\" etc.    Bunene.--A god associated with Samas and Istar at Sippar and  elsewhere. He \"gave\" and \"renewed\" to his worshippers.    Dagan.--This deity, whose worship extends back to an exceedingly early  date, is generally identified with the Phoenician Dagon. Hammurabi  seems to speak of the Euphrates as being \"the boundary of Dagan,\" whom  he calls his creator. In later inscriptions the form Daguna, which  approaches nearer to the West Semitic form, is found in a few personal  names. The Phoenician statues of this deity showed him with the lower  part of his body in the form of a fish (see 1 Sam. v. 4). Whether the  deities clothed in a fish's skin in the Nimroud gallery be Dagon or  not is uncertain--they may be intended for Ea or Aa, the Oannes of  Berosus, who was represented in this way. Probably the two deities  were regarded as identical.    Damu.--a goddess regarded as equivalent to Gula by the Babylonians and  Assyrians. She was goddess of healing, and made one's dreams happy.    Dumu-zi-abzu, \"Tammuz of the Abyss.\"--This was one of the six sons of  Ea or Aa, according to the lists. His worship is exceedingly ancient,  and goes back to the time of E-anna-tum of Lagas (about 4000 B.C.).  What connection, if any, he may have with Tammuz, the spouse of Istar,  is unknown. Jastrow apparently regards him as a distinct deity, and  translates his name \"the child of the life of the water-deep.\"    Elali.--A deity identified with the Hebrew Helal, the new moon. Only  found in names of the time of the Hammurabi dynasty, in one of which  he appears as \"a creator.\"    En-nugi is described as \"lord of streams and canals,\" and \"lord of the  earth, lord of no-return.\" This last description, which gives the  meaning of his name, suggests that he was one of the gods of the realm  of Eres-ki-gal, though he may have borne that name simply as god of  streams, which always flow down, never the reverse.    Gibil.--One of the names of the god of fire, sometimes transcribed  Girru by Assyriologists, the meaning apparently being \"the fire-bearer\"  or \"light-bearer.\" Girru is another name of this deity, and  translates an ideographic group, rendered by Delitzsch \"great\" or  \"highest decider,\" suggesting the custom of trial by ordeal. He was  identified with Nirig, in Semitic Enu-restu.    Gusqi-banda or Kuski-banda, one of the names of Ea, probably as god of  gold-workers.    Isum, \"the glorious sacrificer,\" seemingly a name of the fire-god as a  means whereby burnt offerings were made. Nur-Isum, \"light of Isum,\" is  found as a man's name.    Kaawanu, the planet Saturn.    Lagamal.--A god identified with the Elamite Lagamar, whose name is  regarded as existing in Chedorlaomer (cf. Gen. xiv. 2). He was the  chief god of Mair, \"the ship-city.\"    Lugal-Amarada or Lugal-Marad.--This name means \"king of Marad,\" a city  as yet unidentified. The king of this place seems to have been  Nerigal, of whom, therefore, Lugal-Marad is another name.    Lugal-banda.--This name means \"the powerful king,\" or something  similar, and the god bearing it is supposed to be the same as Nerigal.  His consort, however, was named Nin-sun (or Nin-gul).    Lugal-Du-azaga, \"the king of the glorious seat.\"--The founder of  Eridu, \"the good city within the Abyss,\" probably the paradise (or a  paradise) of the world to come.

I bragged before men I'd reason to believe would take my  words deep.  For instance, not long ago I missed some stock, an',  happenin' into Greaves's place one Saturday night, I shore talked loud.  His barroom was full of men an' some of them were in my black book.  Greaves took my talk a little testy.  He said. 'Wal, Gass, mebbe you're  right aboot some of these cattle thieves livin' among us, but ain't  they jest as liable to be some of your friends or relatives as Ted  Meeker's or mine or any one around heah?'  That was where Greaves an'  me fell out.  I yelled at him: 'No, by God, they're not! My record heah  an' that of my people is open.  The least I can say for you, Greaves,  an' your crowd, is that your records fade away on dim trails.'  Then he  said, nasty-like, 'Wal, if you could work out all the dim trails in the  Tonto you'd shore be surprised.'  An' then I roared.  Shore that was  the chance I was lookin' for.  I swore the trails he hinted of would be  tracked to the holes of the rustlers who made them.  I told him I had  sent for you an' when you got heah these slippery, mysterious thieves,  whoever they were, would shore have hell to pay.  Greaves said he hoped  so, but he was afraid I was partial to my Indian son.  Then we had hot  words.  Blaisdell got between us. When I was leavin' I took a partin'  fling at him.  'Greaves, you ought to know the Isbels, considerin'  you're from Texas.  Maybe you've got reasons for throwin' taunts at my  claims for my son Jean.  Yes, he's got Indian in him an' that 'll be  the worse for the men who will have to meet him.  I'm tellin' you,  Greaves, Jean Isbel is the black sheep of the family.  If you ride down  his record you'll find he's shore in line to be another Poggin, or  Reddy Kingfisher, or Hardin', or any of the Texas gunmen you ought to  remember.... Greaves, there are men rubbin' elbows with you right heah  that my Indian son is goin' to track down!'\"    Jean bent his head in stunned cognizance of the notoriety with which  his father had chosen to affront any and all Tonto Basin men who were  under the ban of his suspicion.  What a terrible reputation and trust  to have saddled upon him!  Thrills and strange, heated sensations  seemed to rush together inside Jean, forming a hot ball of fire that  threatened to explode.  A retreating self made feeble protests. He saw  his own pale face going away from this older, grimmer man.    \"Son, if I could have looked forward to anythin' but blood spillin' I'd  never have given you such a name to uphold,\" continued the rancher.  \"What I'm goin' to tell you now is my secret.  My other sons an' Ann  have never heard it.  Jim Blaisdell suspects there's somethin' strange,  but he doesn't know.  I'll shore never tell anyone else but you. An'  you must promise to keep my secret now an' after I am gone.\"    \"I promise,\" said Jean.    \"Wal, an' now to get it out,\" began his father, breathing hard. His  face twitched and his hands clenched.  \"The sheepman heah I have to  reckon with is Lee Jorth, a lifelong enemy of mine.  We were born in  the same town, played together as children, an' fought with each other  as boys.  We never got along together.  An' we both fell in love with  the same girl.  It was nip an' tuck for a while. Ellen Sutton belonged  to one of the old families of the South. She was a beauty, an' much  courted, an' I reckon it was hard for her to choose.  But I won her an'  we became engaged.  Then the war broke out.  I enlisted with my brother  Jean.  He advised me to marry Ellen before I left.  But I would not.  That was the blunder of my life. Soon after our partin' her letters  ceased to come.  But I didn't distrust her.  That was a terrible time  an' all was confusion. Then I got crippled an' put in a hospital.  An'  in aboot a year I was sent back home.\"    At this juncture Jean refrained from further gaze at his father's face.    \"Lee Jorth had gotten out of goin' to war,\" went on the rancher, in  lower, thicker voice.  \"He'd married my sweetheart, Ellen.... I knew  the story long before I got well.  He had run after her like a hound  after a hare.... An' Ellen married him.  Wal, when I was able to get  aboot I went to see Jorth an' Ellen.  I confronted them. I had to know  why she had gone back on me.  Lee Jorth hadn't changed any with all his  good fortune.  He'd made Ellen believe in my dishonor. But, I reckon,  lies or no lies, Ellen Sutton was faithless.  In my absence he had won  her away from me.  An' I saw that she loved him as she never had me.  I  reckon that killed all my generosity.  If she'd been imposed upon an'  weaned away by his lies an' had regretted me a little I'd have  forgiven, perhaps.  But she worshiped him.  She was his slave.  An' I,  wal, I learned what hate was.    \"The war ruined the Suttons, same as so many Southerners.  Lee Jorth  went in for raisin' cattle.  He'd gotten the Sutton range an' after a  few years he began to accumulate stock.  In those days every cattleman  was a little bit of a thief.  Every cattleman drove in an' branded  calves he couldn't swear was his.  Wal, the Isbels were the strongest  cattle raisers in that country.  An' I laid a trap for Lee Jorth,  caught him in the act of brandin' calves of mine I'd marked, an' I  proved him a thief.  I made him a rustler.  I ruined him.  We met once.  But Jorth was one Texan not strong on the draw, at least against an  Isbel.  He left the country.  He had friends an' relatives an' they  started him at stock raisin' again.  But he began to gamble an' he got  in with a shady crowd.  He went from bad to worse an' then he came back  home.  When I saw the change in proud, beautiful Ellen Sutton, an' how  she still worshiped Jorth, it shore drove me near mad between pity an'  hate.... Wal, I reckon in a Texan hate outlives any other feelin'.  There came a strange turn of the wheel an' my fortunes changed. Like  most young bloods of the day, I drank an' gambled.  An' one night I run  across Jorth an' a card-sharp friend.  He fleeced me.  We quarreled.  Guns were thrown.  I killed my man.... Aboot that period the Texas  Rangers had come into existence.... An', son, when I said I never was  run out of Texas I wasn't holdin' to strict truth.  I rode out on a  hoss.    \"I went to Oregon.  There I married soon, an' there Bill an' Guy were  born.  Their mother did not live long.  An' next I married your mother,  Jean.  She had some Indian blood, which, for all I could see, made her  only the finer.  She was a wonderful woman an' gave me the only  happiness I ever knew.  You remember her, of course, an' those home  days in Oregon.  I reckon I made another great blunder when I moved to  Arizona.  But the cattle country had always called me.  I had heard of  this wild Tonto Basin an' how Texans were settlin' there.  An' Jim  Blaisdell sent me word to come--that this shore was a garden spot of  the West.  Wal, it is.  An' your mother was gone--    \"Three years ago Lee Jorth drifted into the Tonto.  An', strange to me,  along aboot a year or so after his comin' the Hash Knife Gang rode up  from Texas.  Jorth went in for raisin' sheep.  Along with some other  sheepmen he lives up in the Rim canyons.  Somewhere back in the wild  brakes is the hidin' place of the Hash Knife Gang.  Nobody but me, I  reckon, associates Colonel Jorth, as he's called, with Daggs an' his  gang.  Maybe Blaisdell an' a few others have a hunch.  But that's no  matter.  As a sheepman Jorth has a legitimate grievance with the  cattlemen.  But what could be settled by a square consideration for the  good of all an' the future Jorth will never settle.  He'll never settle  because he is now no longer an honest man.  He's in with Daggs. I  cain't prove this, son, but I know it.  I saw it in Jorth's face when I  met him that day with Greaves.  I saw more.  I shore saw what he is up  to.  He'd never meet me at an even break.  He's dead set on usin' this  sheep an' cattle feud to ruin my family an' me, even as I ruined him.  But he means more, Jean.  This will be a war between Texans, an' a  bloody war.  There are bad men in this Tonto--some of the worst that  didn't get shot in Texas.  Jorth will have some of these fellows....  Now, are we goin' to wait to be sheeped off our range an' to be  murdered from ambush?\"    \"No, we are not,\" replied Jean, quietly.    \"Wal, come down to the house,\" said the rancher, and led the way  without speaking until he halted by the door.  There he placed his  finger on a small hole in the wood at about the height of a man's head.  Jean saw it was a bullet hole and that a few gray hairs stuck to its  edges.  The rancher stepped closer to the door-post, so that his head  was within an inch of the wood.  Then he looked at Jean with eyes in  which there glinted dancing specks of fire, like wild sparks.    \"Son, this sneakin' shot at me was made three mawnin's ago.  I  recollect movin' my haid just when I heard the crack of a rifle.  Shore  was surprised.  But I got inside quick.\"    Jean scarcely heard the latter part of this speech.  He seemed doubled  up inwardly, in hot and cold convulsions of changing emotion.  A  terrible hold upon his consciousness was about to break and let go. The  first shot had been fired and he was an Isbel.  Indeed, his father had  made him ten times an Isbel.  Blood was thick.  His father did not  speak to dull ears.  This strife of rising tumult in him seemed the  effect of years of calm, of peace in the woods, of dreamy waiting for  he knew not what.  It was the passionate primitive life in him that had  awakened to the call of blood ties.    \"That's aboot all, son,\" concluded the rancher.  \"You understand now  why I feel they're goin' to kill me.  I feel it heah.\"  With solemn  gesture he placed his broad hand over his heart.  \"An', Jean, strange  whispers come to me at night.  It seems like your mother "]]]
