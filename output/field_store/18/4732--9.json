Both  Maurice de Gu['e]rin and Tennyson, who have superficial characteristics in  common, send us back to Theocritus, the most human, the most lyrical,  the most unaffectedly pagan of all the poets who wrote before Pan said  his despairing good-bye to all the Grecian Isles. But what a mixture is  this!--Maurice and Eug['e]nie de Gu['e]rin, Keats, Madame de S['e]vign['e],  Theocritus, and Tennyson, the Elizabethan Campion--and yet they are all  related.    In fact, ladies and gentlemen, I have never read any good book that was  not related intimately to at least a score of other books. It is true  that in a measure a book gives to us what we take to it; and we can only  take much out of it when we approach the group of ministering authors  who alone make life both cheerful and endurable.    The received methods of \"teaching\" the classics in what people call \"the  dead languages\" nearly always weaken the faculties of the soul, while  they may develop certain hidden abilities of the mind. This favourite  process of pedagogues very often defeats itself. Mr. Edward Roth  honestly believed that the Roman Empire had risen, declined, and fallen  in order that the Latin language might live! The logical result of this  teaching on the eager young mind, at once logical, ductile, and  obstinate, was to induce it to discover something about the Roman  Empire, in order that it might cease to yawn over the declensions, and  to be bored by prosody; to discover why the glorious Empire had lived  and died in order to produce an elaborate mound of charred bones! Mr.  Roth himself, though a classicist of the classicists, managed to make  the Romans interesting in conversation; he always impressed one that the  Roman baths, or the chariot races, or the banquets, which he admitted  were full of colour and life, were by comparison faded and pale in the  glow and aroma of the sentences invented by the Latins to describe them!    The impossibility of getting anything out of the study of Greek by hard  work, sent me, after I had read Maurice de Gu['e]rin's \"Centaure,\" to read  joyously an edition of the \"Idyls of Theocritus\" in French. While  browsing I found on the shelves of the Mercantile Library the novels of  Tourgu['e]neff in the same language. This delayed me a little. I found  Theocritus and Bion and Moschus in the Bohn Edition, which I think has  now become the beneficent \"Everyman's Library.\" I revelled! The Mimes of  Herondas had not yet been discovered, but some of the dialogues in these  poems contained all the best of their essences. My friends among the  hard workers at the \"Classics\" scorned me. The elderly gentleman from  Oxford who gave us lessons three or four times a week and held that,  when we were able to translate at sight a certain page of Greek which he  had composed himself from various great authors, that we were perfect,  treated me as a pariah; but that made no difference. I continued, in  merciful leisure, to saturate myself in the golden glow of the Sicilian  poets. I tried hard to express my devotion to Theocritus by paraphrases,  very slightly from the original Greek, mostly from the French, and  partly from the Bohn Edition. I quote a result which Mr. Edmund Clarence  Stedman said was too paraphrastic. It is from the \"Cyclops\":        Softer than lambs and whiter than the curds,      O Galatea, swan-nymph of the sea!      Vain is my longing, worthless are my words;      Why do you come in night's sweet dreams to me,      And when I wake, swift leave me, as in fear      The lambkin hastens when a wolf is near?        Why did my mother on a dark-bright day      Bring you, for hyacinths, a-near my cave?      I was the guide, and through the tangled way      I thoughtless led you; I am now your slave.      Peace left my soul when you knocked at my heart--      Come, Galatea, never to depart!        Though I am dark and ugly to the sight--      A Cyclops I, and stronger there are few--      Of you I dream through all the quick-paced night,      And in the morn ten fawns I feed for you,      And four young bears: O rise from grots below,      Soft love and peace with me forever know!        Last night I dreamed that I, a monster gilled,      Swam in the sea and saw you singing there:      I gave you lilies and your grotto filled      With the sweet odours of all flowers rare;      I gave you apples, as I kissed your hand,      And reddest poppies from my richest land.        Oh, brave the restless billows of your world:      They toss and tremble; see my cypress-grove,      And bending laurels, and the tendrils curled      Of honeyed grapes, and a fresh treasure-trove      In vine-crowned AEtna, of pure-running rills!      O Galatea, kill the scorn that kills!        Softer than lambs and whiter than the curds,      O Galatea, listen to my prayer:      Come, come to land, and hear the song of birds;      Rise, rise, from ocean-depths, as lily-fair      As you are in my dreams! Come, then, O Sleep,      For you alone can bring her from the deep.        And Galatea, in her cool, green waves,      Plaits her long hair with purple flower-bells,      And laughs and sings, while black-browed Cyclops raves      And to the wind his love-lorn story tells:      For well she knows that Cyclops will ere long      Forget, as poets do, his pain in song.    No sensitive mind can dwell on Theocritus, even when interpreted in  English prose, without feeling something of the joy of the old Syracusan  in life. His human nature is of the kind that makes the nymphs and  swains of Alexander Pope dull and artificial. There are flies in this  delicious ointment, one must admit, touches of corruption which a  degenerate paganism condoned and palliated, but we must remember, as an  extenuation of the Greek attitude, that the oracle of Delphi protested  against them. The cyprus plains of Theocritus yet echo with the call of  the cicada, and the anemones still bloom. The pipes of Pan are not all  silent. The world would lose some of its beauty if Theocritus and the  Sicilian poets did not entice us to hear their echoes.    But to how many links of a long chain does Maurice de Gu['e]rin lead us!  Here is another link--Jos['e] de Her['e]dia, and his jewelled and chiselled  sonnets--the \"Antique Medal\" with its peerless sestette, which combines  the essential meanings of Keats's \"Ode to a Grecian Urn.\"          _Le temps passe. Tout meurt. Le marbre m[^e]me s'use.      Argrigente n'est plus qu'une ombre, et Syracuse      Dort sous le bleu linceul de son ciel indulgent;_          _Et seul le dur m['e]tal que l'amour fit docile      Garde encore en sa fleur, aux m['e]dailles d'argent,      L'immortelle beaut['e] des vierges de Sicile.\"_    A translation of which reads:        Time goes; all dies; marble itself decays;      A shadow Agrigentum; Syracuse      Sleeps, still in death, beneath her kind sky's shades;      But the hard metal guards through all the days,      Silver grown docile unto love's own use,      The immortal beauty of Sicilian maids.    I always felt that Dante would have been less devoted to Virgil had he  known Theocritus. The artificial Roman seems faded when one compares his  rural elegies with the lovely pictures of the first of all the Syracusan  poets. Horatius Flaccus had more of the quality of Theocritus than of  Virgil; and though Virgil might have been a good guide for Dante in his  sublime wanderings, he was a guide of the intellect rather than of the  heart. It requires some courage, perhaps, to confess that one reads  Theocritus in English rather than in Greek. The French rendering is too  paraphrastic; but, although my classical friends, or rather my friends  _enrag['e]_ of the \"Classics,\" honestly despise me for making this  confession, I shamelessly enjoy Theocritus in the Bohn Edition, without  even using it as a \"crib\" to the forgotten Greek text rather than begin  a course of Grecian philology and to lose the perfume of the crushed  thyme or the sight of the competing shepherds on the shrub-dotted  prairie.      _Dante_    A constant reader is one who always returns to his first loves. He may  find them changed because he has changed; but the soul of that reader is  dead who never goes back to \"Ivanhoe\" to renew the thrill of the famous  tournament or to discover whether Leather Stocking is the superman he  once seemed to be. I find myself, in old age, divided between two  conflicting opinions. \"There is no leisure in this country,\" I am told.  \"A great change has taken place. The motor car has destroyed the art of  reading, and, as for the good old books--nobody reads them any more.\" On  the other hand, I hear, \"People do read, but they read only frivolous  books which follow one another like the hot-cakes made at noon in the  windows of Mr. Child's restaurants.\"    Personally, I cannot accept either opinion. In the first place, the  winter is the time for reading--I recall Robert Underwood Johnson's  \"Winter Hour\" when I think of this--and the motor car, especially in  country places, does not function violently in the winter time. Many  journeys from Boston, through New England, to the Middle West have  taught me that folk are reading and discussing books more than ever.  Whatever may be said of the mass of American people, who are probably  learning slowly what national culture means, there are at the top of  this mass thousands of Americans who love good books, who possess good  books, and who return each year to the loves of their youth.    The celebration of the sixth centenary of the death of Dante Alighieri  proves this. It is true enough that Dante and Goethe and Milton are more  talked about in English-speaking"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#12)"],[1,"that was like a gale in itself.    Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until  being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a  ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the  bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their  several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or  had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of  some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And  every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder  word for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had  shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he  cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember  him.    It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of  the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the  lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as  profound as death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus  engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to  Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a  bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his  side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!    'Ha, ha!' laughed Scrooge's nephew. 'Ha, ha, ha!'    If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blessed  in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can say is, I should like to  know him too. Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.    It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there  is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so  irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge's  nephew laughed in this way--holding his sides, rolling his head, and  twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions--Scrooge's  niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled  friends, being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.    'Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!'    'He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!' cried Scrooge's  nephew. 'He believed it, too!'    'More shame for him, Fred!' said Scrooge's niece indignantly. Bless  those women! they never do anything by halves. They are always in  earnest.    She was very pretty; exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,  surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made  to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about  her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the  sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature's head.  Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but  satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory!    'He's a comical old fellow,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'that's the truth;  and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their  own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.'    'I'm sure he is very rich, Fred,' hinted Scrooge's niece. 'At least, you  always tell _me_ so.'    'What of that, my dear?' said Scrooge's nephew. 'His wealth is of no use  to him. He don't do any good with it. He don't make himself comfortable  with it. He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is  ever going to benefit Us with it.'    'I have no patience with him,' observed Scrooge's niece. Scrooge's  niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.    'Oh, I have!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'I am sorry for him; I couldn't be  angry with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself always.  Here he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine  with us. What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner.'    'Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,' interrupted Scrooge's  niece. Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have  been competent judges, because they had just had dinner; and with the  dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.    'Well! I am very glad to hear it,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'because I  haven't any great faith in these young housekeepers. What do _you_ say,  Topper?'    Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters,  for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right  to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge's niece's  sister--the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the  roses--blushed.    'Do go on, Fred,' said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands. 'He never  finishes what he begins to say! He is such a ridiculous fellow!'    Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to  keep the infection off, though the plump sister tried hard to do it with  aromatic vinegar, his example was unanimously followed.    'I was only going to say,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'that the consequence  of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I  think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm.  I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own  thoughts, either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers. I mean  to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for  I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help  thinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good  temper, year after year, and saying, \"Uncle Scrooge, how are you?\" If it  only put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, _that's_  something; and I think I shook him yesterday.'    It was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.  But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed  at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their  merriment, and passed the bottle, joyously.    After tea they had some music. For they were a musical family, and knew  what they were about when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you:  especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and  never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over  it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and played, among other  tunes, a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle  it in two minutes) which had been familiar to the child who fetched  Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost  of Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the things  that Ghost had shown him came upon his mind; he softened more and more;  and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he  might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with  his own hands, without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob  Marley.    [Illustration: _The way he went after that plump sister in the lace  tucker!_]    But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After a while they  played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never  better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.  Stop! There was first a game at blind man's-buff. Of course there was.  And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes  in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and  Scrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The  way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on  the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling  over the chairs, bumping up against the piano, smothering himself  amongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew  where the plump sister was. He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had  fallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose, he would have  made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an  affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in  the direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn't  fair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he caught her; when, in  spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him,  he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct  was the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her; his  pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to  assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her  finger, and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No  doubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in  office, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.    Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind man's-buff party, but was made  comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where  the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the  forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the  alphabet. Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very  great, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her sisters  hollow; though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.  There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all  played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly forgetting, in the interest he  had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he  sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed  right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to  cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge, blunt as he took it in  his head to be.    The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon  him with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay  until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done.    'Here is a new game,' said Scrooge. 'One half-hour,"]]]
