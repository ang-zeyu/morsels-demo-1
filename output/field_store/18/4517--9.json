Diverse accounts were current  in [men's] mouths, and many exaggerations were heard [to the effect] that  there was no hope of deliverance.    Now all those persons who were with Him with one accord entreated and  insisted that they should [be permitted to] accompany Him, and, how much  soever the government admonished and forbade them, it was fruitless.  Finally one Haji Ja'far by name was moved to lamentation, and with his own  hand cut his throat. When the government beheld it thus, it gave  permission to all of them to accompany Him, conveyed them from Adrianople  to the seashore, and thence transported them to Akka. Mirza Yahya they  sent in like manner to Famagusta.    During the latter days [passed] in Adrianople Baha'u'llah composed a  detailed epistle setting forth all matters clearly and minutely. He  unfolded and expounded the main principles of the sect, and made clear and  plain its ethics, manners, course, and mode of conduct: He treated certain  political questions in detail, and adduced sundry proofs of His  truthfulness: He declared the good intent, loyalty, and sincerity of the  sect, and wrote some fragments of prayers, some in Persian, but the  greater part in Arabic. He then placed it in a packet and adorned its  address with the royal name of His Majesty the King of Persia, and wrote  [on it] that some person pure of heart and pure of life, dedicated to God,  and prepared for martyr-sacrifice, must, with perfect resignation and  willingness, convey this epistle into the presence of the King. A youth  named Mirza Badi, a native of _Kh_urasan, took the epistle, and hastened  toward the presence of His Majesty the King. The Royal Train had its abode  and station outside Tihran, so he took his stand alone on a rock in a  place far off but opposite to the Royal Pavilion, and awaited day and  night the passing of the Royal escort or the attainment of admission into  the Imperial Presence. Three days did he pass in a state of fasting and  vigilance: an emaciated body and enfeebled spirit remained. On the fourth  day the Royal Personage was examining all quarters and directions with a  telescope when suddenly his glance fell on this man who was seated in the  utmost respectful attitude on a rock. It was inferred from the indications  [perceived] that he must certainly have thanks [to offer], or some  complaint or demand for redress and justice [to prefer]. [The King]  commanded one of those in attendance at the court to inquire into the  circumstances of this youth. On interrogation [it was found that] he  carried a letter which he desired to convey with his own hand into the  Royal Presence. On receiving permission to approach, he cried out before  the pavilion with a dignity, composure, and respectfulness surpassing  description, and in a loud voice, \"O King, I have come unto thee from  Sheba with a weighty message!\"(27) [The King] commanded to take the letter  and arrest the bearer. His Majesty the King wished to act with  deliberation and desired to discover the truth, but those who were present  before him loosed their tongues in violent reprehension, saying, \"This  person has shown great presumption and amazing audacity, for he hath  without fear or dread brought the letter of him against whom all peoples  are angered, of him who is banished to Bulgaria and Sclavonia, into the  presence of the King. If so be that he do not instantly suffer a grievous  punishment there will be an increase of this great presumption.\" So the  ministers of the court signified [that he should suffer] punishment and  ordered the torture. As the first torment they applied the chain and rack,  saying, \"Make known thy other friends that thou mayest be delivered from  excruciating punishment, and make thy comrades captive that thou mayest  escape from the torment of the chain and the keenness of the sword.\" But,  torture, brand, and torment him as they might, they saw naught but  steadfastness and silence, and found naught but dumb endurance [on his  part]. So, when the torture gave no result, they [first] photographed him  (the executioners on his left and on his right, and he sitting bound in  fetters and chains beneath the sword with perfect meekness and composure),  and then slew and destroyed him. This photograph I sent for, and found  worthy of contemplation, for he was seated with wonderful humility and  strange submissiveness, in utmost resignation.    Now when His Majesty the King had perused certain passages and become  cognizant of the contents of the epistle, he was much affected at what had  taken place and manifested regret, because his courtiers had acted hastily  and put into execution a severe punishment. It is even related that he  said thrice, \"Doth anyone punish [one who is but] the channel of          [Pages 61-80]      correspondence?\" Then the Royal Command was issued that their Reverences  the learned doctors and honorable and accomplished divines should write a  reply to that epistle. But when the most expert doctors of the capital  became aware of the contents of the letter they ordained: \"That this  person, without regarding [the fact] that he is at variance with the  Perspicuous Religion, is a meddler with custom and creed, and a troubler  of kings and emperors. Therefore to eradicate, subdue, repress, and repel  [this sect] is one of the requirements of the Well-established Path, and  indeed the chief of obligations.\"    This answer was not approved before the [Royal] Presence, for the contents  of this epistle had no obvious discordance with the Law or with reason,  and did not meddle with political or administrative matters, nor interfere  with or attack the Throne of Sovereignty. They ought, therefore, to have  discussed the real points at issue, and to have written clearly and  explicitly such an answer as would have caused the disappearance of doubts  and the solution of difficulties, and would have become a fulcrum for  discussion to all.    Now of this epistle sundry passages shall be set forth in writing to  conduce to a better understanding [of the matter] by all people. At the  beginning of the epistle was a striking passage in the Arabic language  [treating] of questions of faith and assurance; the sacrifice of life in  the way of the Beloved; the state of resignation and contentment; the  multiplicity of misfortunes, calamities, hardships, and afflictions; and  falling under suspicion of seditiousness through the machinations of foes;  the establishment of His innocence in the presence of His Majesty the  King; the repudiation of seditious persons and disavowal of the rebellious  party; the conditions of sincere belief in the verses of the Qur'an; the  needfulness of godly virtues, distinction from all other creatures in this  transitory abode, obedience to the commandments, and avoidance of things  prohibited; the evidence of divine support in the affair of the Bab; the  inability of whosoever is upon the earth to withstand a heavenly thing;  His own awakening at the divine afflux, and His falling thereby into  unbounded calamities; His acquisition of the divine gift, His  participation in spiritual God-given grace, and His illumination with  immediate knowledge without study; the excusableness of His [efforts for  the] admonition of mankind, their direction toward the attainment of human  perfections, and their enkindlement with the fire of divine love;  encouragements to the directing of energy towards the attainment of a  state greater than the degree of earthly sovereignty; eloquent prayers  [written] in the utmost self-abasement, devotion, and humility; and the  like of this. Afterwards He discussed [other] matters in the Persian  language. And the form of it is this:    \"O God, this is a letter which I wish to send to the King; and Thou  knowest that I have not desired aught of him save the display of his  justice to Thy people, and the showing forth of his favors to the dwellers  in Thy Kingdom. And verily, by My soul, I have not desired aught save what  Thou hast desired, neither, by Thy Might, do I desire aught save what Thou  desirest. Perish that being which desireth of Thee aught save Thyself!  And, by Thy Glory, Thy good pleasure is the limit of My hope, and Thy Will  the extremity of My desire! Be merciful then, O God, to this poor [soul]  Who hath caught hold of the skirt of Thy richness, and to this humble  [suppliant] Who calleth on Thee, for Thou art indeed the Mighty, the  Great. Help, O God, His Majesty the King to execute Thy laws amongst Thy  servants and to show forth Thy justice amidst Thy creatures, that he may  rule over this sect as he ruleth over those who are beside them. Verily  Thou art the Potent, the Mighty, the Wise.    \"Agreeably to the permission and consent of the King of the age, this  Servant turned from the place of the Royal Throne(28) toward  'Iraq-i-'Arab, and in that land abode twelve years. During the period of  [His] sojourn [there] no description of His condition was laid before the  Royal Presence, neither did any representation go to foreign states.  Relying upon God did He abide in that land, until a certain functionary  came to 'Iraq, who, on his arrival, fell to designing the affliction of a  company of poor unfortunates. Every day, beguiled by certain of the  doctors of Persia, he persecuted these servants; although nothing  prejudicial to Church or State, or at variance with the principles and  customs of their countrymen had been observed in them. So this Servant  [was moved] by this reflection: 'May it not be that by reason of the deeds  of the transgressors some action at variance with the world-ordering  counsel of the King should be engendered!' Therefore was an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19312"],[0,"Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas (#12)"],[1,"become as wise physicians and care for and heal  this sick person, in accord with the divine teachings, in order that--God  willing--it may perchance gain health, find eternal healing and that its  lost powers may be restored; and that the person of the world may find  such health, freshness and purity that it will appear in the utmost beauty  and charm.    The first remedy is to guide the people, so that they may turn unto God,  hearken unto the divine commandments and go forth with a hearing ear and  seeing eye. After this swift and certain remedy hath been applied, then  according to the divine teachings, they ought to be trained in the  conduct, morals and deeds of the Supreme Concourse, encouraged and inspire  with the gifts of the Kingdom of ABHA. The hearts should be purified and  cleansed from every trace of hatred and rancor and enabled to engage in  truthfulness, conciliation, uprightness and love toward the world of  humanity; so that the East and the West may embrace each other like unto  two lovers, enmity and animosity may vanish from the human world and the  universal peace be established!    O ye friends of God! Be kind to all peoples and nations, have love for all  of them, exert yourselves to purify the hearts as much as you can, and  bestow abundant effort in rejoicing the souls. Be ye a sprinkling of rain  to every meadow and a water of life to every tree. Be ye as fragrant musk  to every nostril and a soul-refreshing breeze to every invalid. Be ye  salutary water to every thirsty one, a wise guide to every one led astray,  an affectionate father or mother to every orphan, and, in the utmost joy  and fragrance, a son or daughter to every one bent with age. Be ye a rich  treasure to every indigent one; consider love and union as a delectable  paradise, and count annoyance and hostility as the torment of hell-fire.  Exert with your soul; seek no rest in body; supplicate and beseech with  your heart and search for divine assistance and favor, in order that ye  may make this world the Paradise of ABHA and this terrestrial globe the  arena of the Supreme Kingdom. If ye make an effort, it is certain that  these lights will shine, this cloud of mercy shall rain, this  soul-nourishing breeze shall waft, and the scent of this most fragrant  musk be diffused.    O ye friends of God! Be ye not concerned with the events transpiring at  this Blessed Spot, and give no thought thereto. Whatever may happen is  good, for calamities are bestowal itself, hardship is the reality of  mercy, discomposure is but composure of mind, and sacrifice of life is a  manifest gift. Whatever may happen is a bounty from God, the Most High. Be  ye engaged in your own affairs; be employed in guiding the people; train  the souls in the qualities and nature of Abdul-Baha, and convey the  glad-tidings of the Kingdom of ABHA to the people. Do not seek rest during  night and day and sit not tranquil for a minute. Bring these glad-tidings  to the hearing of mankind with the utmost exertion, and accept every  calamity and affliction in your love for God and reliance on Abdul-Baha.  Endure the censure of enemies and bear the reproaches of the people of  oppression with patience. Follow the example of Abdul-Baha and at every  moment wish to offer yourselves in the path of the Beauty of ABHA. Shine  ye like unto the sun and roar and move like unto the sea; impart life to  mountain and desert like unto clouds, and similar to the vernal breeze,  bestow freshness, grace and elegance on the trees of human temples.          \"O ye children of the Kingdom!...\"      O ye(33) children of the Kingdom!    It is New Year; that is to say, the rounding of the cycle of the year. A  year is the expression of a cycle (of the sun); but now is the beginning  of a cycle of Realty, a New Cycle, a New Age, a New Century, a New Time  and a New Year. Therefore it is very blessed.    I wish this blessing to appear and become manifest in the faces and  characteristics of the believers, so that they, too, may become a new  people, and having found new life and been baptized with fire and spirit,  may make the world a new world, to the end that the old earth may  disappear and the new earth appear; old ideas depart and new thoughts  come; old garments be cast aside and new garments put on; ancient politics  whose foundation is war be discarded and modern politics founded on peace  raise the standard of victory; the new star shine and gleam and the new  sun illumine and radiate; new flowers bloom; the new spring become known;  the new breeze blow; the new bounty descend; the new tree give forth new  fruit; the new voice become raised and this new sound reach the ears, that  the new will follow the new, and all the old furnishings and adornments be  cast aside and new decorations put in their places.    I desire for you all that you will have this great assistance and partake  of this great bounty, and that in spirit and heart you will strive and  endeavor until the world of war become the world of peace; the world of  darkness the world of light; satanic conduct be turned into heavenly  behavior; the ruined places become built up; the sword be turne dinto the  olive branch; the flash of hatred become the flame of the love of God and  the noise of the gun the voice of the Kingdom; the soldiers of death the  soldiers of life; all the nations of the world one nation; all races as  one race; and all national anthems harmonized into one melody.    Then this material realm will be Paradise, the earth Heaven, and the world  of Satan become the world of Angels.          \"O ye Cohorts of God!...\"      O ye(34) Cohorts of God!    A letter which was signed by you in general was received. Its content was  of the utmost beauty, sweetness, eloquence and perfection. While reading  it the utmost happiness was produced. It spoke of fasting during the month  of the Fast. Happy is your condition for you have executed the divine  command; and have arisen to fast in these blessed days. For this physical  fasting is a symbol of the spiritual fasting, that is, abstaining from all  carnal desires, becoming characterized with the attributes of the  spiritual ones, attracted to the heavenly fragrances and enkindled with  the fire of the love of God.    Likewise your letter was an evidence of the union and affinity of the  hearts. I hope that through the bounty and favors of the Most Glorious  Lord, in this new age, the regions of the West become the East of the Sun  of Truth, the believers of God become the dawning-places of lights, the  manifestors of the signs, be protected and guarded from the doubts of the  heedless ones, remain firm and steadfast in the Covenant and Testament,  and strive day and night in order to awaken those who are asleep, to make  mindful those who are heedless, to make confident of the mysteries of the  Kingdom those who are deprived, to confer a share from the never-ending  outpouring upon those who are helpless, to become the heralds of the  Kingdom and to call the inhabitants of this terrestrial world to the  Celestial Realm.    O ye Cohorts of God! Today in the present world each community is  wandering in a wilderness, moving in accord with some passion and desire,  and running to and fro in pursuance of his own imagination. Among the  communities of the world, this community of the \"Most Great Name\" is free  from every thought, keeping aloof from every project and scheme, arising  with the purest designs and intentions, and striving and endeavoring with  the utmost hope to live in accordance with the divine teachings in order  that the surface of the earth become the delectable paradise, the nether  world become the mirror of the Kingdom, the universe become another  universe, and the human race attain to higher morals, conduct and manners.    O ye Cohorts of God! Through the protection and help of the Blessed  Perfection--may my life be a sacrifice to His beloved ones! --you must  conduct and deport yourselves in such a manner that you may stand out  among other souls distinguished by a brilliancy like unto the sun. If any  one of you enters a city he must become the center of attraction because  of the sincerity, faithfulness, love, honesty, fidelity, truthfulness and  loving-kindness of his disposition and nature toward all the inhabitants  of the world, that the people of the city may all cry out: \"This person is  unquestionably a Bahai; for his manners, his behaviour, his conduct, his  morals, his nature and his disposition are of the attributes of the  Bahais.\" Until you do attain to this station, you have not fulfilled the  Covenant and the Testament of God. For according to the irrefutable texts,  He has taken from us a firm covenant that we may live and act in accord  with the divine exhortations, commands and lordly teachings.    O ye Cohorts of God! Now is the time when the signs and the perfections of  the \"Most Great Name\" become manifest and clear in this golden cycle in  order that it may become demonstrated and established beyond doubt that  this period is the period of the Blessed Perfection, and this cycle is  distinguished from all other cycles and epochs.    O ye Cohorts of God! If you observe that a soul has turned his face  completely toward the Cause of God, his intention is centralized upon the  penetration of the Word of God, he is serving the Cause day and night with  the utmost fidelity, no scent of selfishness is inhaled from his manners  and deeds, and no trace of egotism or prejudice is seen in his  personality--nay rather is he a wanderer in the wilderness of the love of  God, and one intoxicated with the wine of the knowledge of God, occupied  wholly with the diffusion of the fragrances of God, and attracted to the  signs of the Kingdom of God; know ye of a certainty that he is confirmed  with the powers of the Kingdom, assisted by the heaven of Might; and he  will shine, gleam and sparkle like unto the morning star with "]]]
