It is a bad habit and it makes discontent.\"                                          XIII                  HOW DRUMMER THE WOODPECKER CAME BY HIS RED CAP                                          XIII                  HOW DRUMMER THE WOODPECKER CAME BY HIS RED CAP      Drummer the Woodpecker was beating his long roll on a hollow tree in the  Green Forest. Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat! Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat! Drummer  thought it the most beautiful sound in the world. After each long roll  he would stop and listen for a reply. You see, sometimes one of his  family in another part of the Green Forest, or over in the Old Orchard,  would hear him drumming and would hasten to find a hollow tree himself  and drum too. Then they would drum back and forth to each other for the  longest time, until all the other little people would scold because of  the racket and would wish they could stop their ears. But it was music,  real music to Drummer and all the members of his family, and Drummer  never was happier than when beating his long roll as he was doing now.    Rat-a-tat-tat-tat! Rat-a-tat-tat-tat! Suddenly Drummer heard a  scratching sound inside the hollow tree. Once more he beat the long roll  and the scratching sound grew louder. Then he heard a voice just a  little way above him.    \"Do Ah hear some one knocking?\" asked the voice.    Drummer looked up. There was Unc' Billy Possum's sharp little face  sticking out of his doorway, and Unc' Billy looked very sleepy and very  cross and at the same time as if he were trying very hard to be polite  and pleasant.    \"Hello, Unc' Billy! Is this your house? I didn't know it when I began to  drum. I wasn't knocking; I was drumming. I just love to drum,\" replied  Drummer.    \"Ah reckons yo' do by the noise yo' have been making, but Ah don't like  being inside the drum. Ah'm feelin' powerful bad in the haid just now,  Brer Drummer, and Ah cert'nly will take it kindly if yo' will find  another drum,\" said Unc' Billy, holding his head in both hands as if he  had a terrible headache.    Drummer looked disappointed and a little bit hurt, but he is one of the  best-natured little people in the Green Forest and always willing to be  obliging.    \"I'm sorry if I have disturbed you, Unc' Billy,\" he replied promptly.  \"Of course I won't drum here any longer, if you don't like it. I'll look  for another hollow tree, though I don't believe I can find another as  good. It is one of the best sounding trees I have ever drummed on. It's  simply beautiful!\" There was a great deal of regret in his voice, as if  it were the hardest work to give up that tree.    \"Ah'll tell yo' where there's another just as good,\" replied Unc' Billy.  \"Yo' see the top of that ol' chestnut-tree way down there in the holler?  Well, yo' try that. Ah'm sure yo' will like it.\"    Drummer thanked Unc' Billy politely and bobbed his red-capped head as he  spread his wings and started in the direction of the big chestnut-tree.  Unc' Billy grinned as he watched him. Then he slowly and solemnly winked  one eye at Peter Rabbit, who had just come along.    \"What's the joke?\" asked Peter.    \"Ah done just sent Brer Drummer down to the big chestnut-tree to drum,\"  Unc' Billy replied, winking again.    \"Why, that's Bobby Coon's house!\" cried Peter, and then he saw the joke  and began to grin too.    In a few minutes they heard Drummer's long roll. Then again and again.  The third time it broke off right in the middle, and right away a  terrible fuss started down at the big chestnut-tree. They could hear  Drummer's voice, and it sounded very angry.    \"Ah reckon Brer Coon was waked up and lost his temper,\" chuckled Unc'  Billy. \"It's a bad habit to lose one's temper. Yes, Sah, it cert'nly is  a bad habit. Ah reckons Ah better be turning in fo' another nap, Brer  Rabbit.\" With that Unc' Billy disappeared, still chuckling.    Hardly was he out of sight when Peter saw Drummer heading that way, and  Drummer looked very much put out about something. He just nodded to  Peter and flew straight to Unc' Billy's tree. Then he began to drum. How  he did drum! His red-capped head flew back and forth as Peter never had  seen it fly before. Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat! Rat-a-tat-tat-tat!  Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat! Drummer hardly paused for breath. There was too  much noise for Peter, and he kicked up his heels and started for the  Smiling Pool, and all the way there he laughed.    \"I hope Unc' Billy is enjoying a good nap,\" he chuckled. \"Drummer  certainly has turned the joke back on Unc' Billy this time, and I guess  it serves him right.\"    He was still laughing when he reached the Smiling Pool. Grandfather Frog  watched him until he began to smile too. You know laughter is catching.  \"Ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho!\" laughed Peter and held his sides.    \"What is the joke?\" demanded Grandfather Frog in his deepest voice.    When Peter could get his breath, he told Grandfather Frog all about the  joke on Unc' Billy Possum. \"Listen!\" said Peter at the end of the story.  They both listened. Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat! The long roll of Drummer the  Woodpecker could be heard clear down to the Smiling Pool, and Peter and  Grandfather Frog knew by the sound that it still came from Unc' Billy's  house.    \"Chug-a-rum! That reminds me,\" said Grandfather Frog. \"Did you ever hear  how Drummer came by his red cap?\"    \"No,\" replied Peter. \"How did he?\" There was great eagerness in Peter's  voice.    \"Well,\" said Grandfather Frog, settling himself in a way that Peter knew  meant a story, \"of course Drummer over there came by his red cap because  it was handed down in the family, but of course there's a reason.\"    \"Of course,\" said Peter, quite as if he knew all about it.    Grandfather Frog rolled his great, goggly eyes and looked at Peter  suspiciously, but Peter looked so innocent and eager that he went on  with his story.    \"Of course, it all happened way back in the days when the world was  young.\"    \"Of course!\" said Peter.    This time Grandfather Frog took no notice. \"Drummer's grandfather a  thousand times removed was just a plain little black and white bird  without the least bit of bright color on him. He didn't have any  sweeter voice than Drummer has to-day. Altogether he seemed to his  neighbors a no-account little fellow, and they didn't have much to do  with him. So Mr. Woodpecker lived pretty much alone. In fact, he lived  alone so much that when he found a hollow tree he used to pound on it  just to make a noise and keep from being lonesome, and that is how he  learned to drum. You see, he hadn't any voice for singing, and so he got  in the habit of drumming to keep his spirits up.    \"Now all the time, right down in his heart, Mr. Woodpecker envied the  birds who had handsome coats. He used to wish and wish that he had  something bright, if it were no more than a pretty necktie. But he never  said anything about it, and no one suspected it but Old Mother Nature,  and Mr. Woodpecker didn't know that she knew it. Whenever he got to  wishing too much, he would try to forget it by hunting for worms that  bored into the trees of the Green Forest and which other birds could not  get because they did not have the stout bill and the long tongue Mr.  Woodpecker possessed.    \"Now it happened that while Old Mother Nature was busy elsewhere, a  great number of worms settled in the Green Forest and began to bore into  the trees, so that after a while many trees grew sickly and then died.  None of the other little people seemed to notice it, or if they did,  they said it was none of their business and that Old Mother Nature ought  to look out for such things. They shrugged their shoulders and went on  playing and having a good time. But Mr. Woodpecker was worried. He loved  the Green Forest dearly, and he began to fear that if something wasn't  done, there wouldn't be any Green Forest. He said as much to some of his  neighbors, but they only laughed at him. The more he thought about it,  the more Mr. Woodpecker worried.    \"'Something must be done,' said he to himself. 'Yes, Sir, something must  be done. If Old Mother Nature doesn't come to attend to things pretty  soon, it will be too late.' Then he made up his mind that he would do  what he could. From early morning until night he hunted worms and dug  them out of the trees. He would start at the bottom of a tree and work  up, going all over it until he was sure that there wasn't another worm  left. Then he would fly to the next tree. He pounded with his bill until  his neck ached. He didn't even take time to drum. His neighbors laughed  at him at first, but he kept right on working, working, working every  hour of the day.    \"At last Old Mother Nature appeared very unexpectedly. She went all  through the Green Forest, and her sharp eyes saw all that Mr. Woodpecker  had done. She didn't say a word to him, but she called all the little  people of the Green Forest before her, and when they were all gathered  around, she sent for Mr. Woodpecker. She made him sit up on a dead limb  of a tall chestnut-tree where all could see him. Then she told just what  he had done, and how he had saved the Green Forest, and how great a debt  the other little people owed to him.    \"'And now that you may never forget it,' she concluded, 'I herewith make  Mr. Woodpecker the policeman of the trees, and this is his reward to be  worn by him and his children forever and ever.' With that she called  Mr. Woodpecker down before her and put on his head a beautiful red cap,  for she knew how in his heart he had longed to wear something bright.  Mr. Woodpecker thanked Old Mother Nature as best he could and then  slipped away where he could be alone with his happiness. All the rest of  the day the other little people heard him drumming off by himself in the  Green Forest and smiled, for they knew that that was the way he was  expressing his joy, having no voice to sing.

Johnson was a free-selector, and his brain went rather queer,     For the constant sight of serpents filled him with a deadly fear;     So he tramped his free-selection, morning, afternoon, and night,     Seeking for some great specific that would cure the serpent's bite.     Till King Billy, of the Mooki, chieftain of the flour-bag head,     Told him, 'Spos'n snake bite pfeller, pfeller mostly drop down dead;     Spos'n snake bite old goanna, then you watch a while you see,     Old goanna cure himself with eating little pfeller tree.'     'That's the cure,' said William Johnson, 'point me out this plant sublime,'     But King Billy, feeling lazy, said he'd go another time.     Thus it came to pass that Johnson, having got the tale by rote,     Followed every stray goanna, seeking for the antidote.           .   .   .   .   .       Loafing once beside the river, while he thought his heart would break,     There he saw a big goanna fighting with a tiger-snake,     In and out they rolled and wriggled, bit each other, heart and soul,     Till the valiant old goanna swallowed his opponent whole.     Breathless, Johnson sat and watched him, saw him struggle up the bank,     Saw him nibbling at the branches of some bushes, green and rank;     Saw him, happy and contented, lick his lips, as off he crept,     While the bulging in his stomach showed where his opponent slept.     Then a cheer of exultation burst aloud from Johnson's throat;     'Luck at last,' said he, 'I've struck it! 'tis the famous antidote.'       'Here it is, the Grand Elixir, greatest blessing ever known,     Twenty thousand men in India die each year of snakes alone.     Think of all the foreign nations, negro, chow, and blackamoor,     Saved from sudden expiration, by my wondrous snakebite cure.     It will bring me fame and fortune!  In the happy days to be,     Men of every clime and nation will be round to gaze on me --     Scientific men in thousands, men of mark and men of note,     Rushing down the Mooki River, after Johnson's antidote.     It will cure Delirium Tremens, when the patient's eyeballs stare     At imaginary spiders, snakes which really are not there.     When he thinks he sees them wriggle, when he thinks he sees them bloat,     It will cure him just to think of Johnson's Snakebite Antidote.'       Then he rushed to the museum, found a scientific man --     'Trot me out a deadly serpent, just the deadliest you can;     I intend to let him bite me, all the risk I will endure,     Just to prove the sterling value of my wondrous snakebite cure.     Even though an adder bit me, back to life again I'd float;     Snakes are out of date, I tell you, since I've found the antidote.'       Said the scientific person, 'If you really want to die,     Go ahead -- but, if you're doubtful, let your sheep-dog have a try.     Get a pair of dogs and try it, let the snake give both a nip;     Give your dog the snakebite mixture, let the other fellow rip;     If he dies and yours survives him, then it proves the thing is good.     Will you fetch your dog and try it?'  Johnson rather thought he would.     So he went and fetched his canine, hauled him forward by the throat.     'Stump, old man,' says he, 'we'll show them we've the genwine antidote.'       Both the dogs were duly loaded with the poison-gland's contents;     Johnson gave his dog the mixture, then sat down to wait events.     'Mark,' he said, 'in twenty minutes Stump'll be a-rushing round,     While the other wretched creature lies a corpse upon the ground.'     But, alas for William Johnson! ere they'd watched a half-hour's spell     Stumpy was as dead as mutton, t'other dog was live and well.     And the scientific person hurried off with utmost speed,     Tested Johnson's drug and found it was a deadly poison-weed;     Half a tumbler killed an emu, half a spoonful killed a goat,     All the snakes on earth were harmless to that awful antidote.           .   .   .   .   .       Down along the Mooki River, on the overlanders' camp,     Where the serpents are in millions, all of the most deadly stamp,     Wanders, daily, William Johnson, down among those poisonous hordes,     Shooting every stray goanna, calls them 'black and yaller frauds'.     And King Billy, of the Mooki, cadging for the cast-off coat,     Somehow seems to dodge the subject of the snake-bite antidote.          Ambition and Art                Ambition         I am the maid of the lustrous eyes      Of great fruition,     Whom the sons of men that are over-wise      Have called Ambition.       And the world's success is the only goal      I have within me;     The meanest man with the smallest soul      May woo and win me.       For the lust of power and the pride of place      To all I proffer.     Wilt thou take thy part in the crowded race      For what I offer?       The choice is thine, and the world is wide --      Thy path is lonely.     I may not lead and I may not guide --      I urge thee only.       I am just a whip and a spur that smites      To fierce endeavour.     In the restless days and the sleepless nights      I urge thee ever.       Thou shalt wake from sleep with a startled cry,      In fright upleaping     At a rival's step as it passes by      Whilst thou art sleeping.       Honour and truth shall be overthrown      In fierce desire;     Thou shalt use thy friend as a stepping-stone      To mount thee higher.       When the curtain falls on the sordid strife      That seemed so splendid,     Thou shalt look with pain on the wasted life      That thou hast ended.       Thou hast sold thy life for a guerdon small      In fitful flashes;     There has been reward -- but the end of all      Is dust and ashes.       For the night has come and it brings to naught      Thy projects cherished,     And thine epitaph shall in brass be wrought --      'He lived and perished.'              Art         I wait for thee at the outer gate,      My love, mine only;     Wherefore tarriest thou so late      While I am lonely.       Thou shalt seek my side with a footstep swift,      In thee implanted     Is the love of Art and the greatest gift      That God has granted.       And the world's concerns with its rights and wrongs      Shall seem but small things --     Poet or painter, a singer of songs,      Thine art is all things.       For the wine of life is a woman's love      To keep beside thee;     But the love of Art is a thing above --      A star to guide thee.       As the years go by with thy love of Art      All undiminished,     Thou shalt end thy days with a quiet heart --      Thy work is finished.       So the painter fashions a picture strong      That fadeth never,     And the singer singeth a wond'rous song      That lives for ever.          The Daylight is Dying           The daylight is dying      Away in the west,     The wild birds are flying      In silence to rest;     In leafage and frondage      Where shadows are deep,     They pass to its bondage --      The kingdom of sleep.     And watched in their sleeping      By stars in the height,     They rest in your keeping,      Oh, wonderful night.       When night doth her glories      Of starshine unfold,     'Tis then that the stories      Of bush-land are told.     Unnumbered I hold them      In memories bright,     But who could unfold them,      Or read them aright?     Beyond all denials      The stars in their glories     The breeze in the myalls      Are part of these stories.     The waving of grasses,      The song of the river     That sings as it passes      For ever and ever,     The hobble-chains' rattle,      The calling of birds,     The lowing of cattle      Must blend with the words.     Without these, indeed, you      Would find it ere long,     As though I should read you      The words of a song     That lamely would linger      When lacking the rune,     The voice of the singer,      The lilt of the tune.       But, as one half-hearing      An old-time refrain,     With memory clearing,      Recalls it again,     These tales, roughly wrought of      The bush and its ways,     May call back a thought of      The wandering days,     And, blending with each      In the mem'ries that throng,     There haply shall reach      You some echo of song.          In Defence of the Bush           So you're back from up the country, Mister Townsman, where you went,     And you're cursing all the business in a bitter discontent;     Well, we grieve to disappoint you, and it makes us sad to hear     That it wasn't cool and shady -- and there wasn't plenty beer,     And the loony bullock snorted when you first came into view;     Well, you know it's not so often that he sees a swell like you;     And the roads were hot and dusty, and the plains were burnt and brown,     And no doubt you're better suited drinking lemon-squash in town.     Yet, perchance, if you should journey down the very track you went     In a month or two at furthest you would wonder what it meant,     Where the sunbaked earth was gasping like a creature in its pain     You would find the grasses waving like a field of summer grain,     And the miles of thirsty gutters blocked with sand and choked with mud,     You would find them mighty rivers with a turbid, sweeping flood;     For the rain and drought and sunshine make no changes in the street,     In the sullen line of buildings and the ceaseless tramp of feet;     But the bush hath moods and changes, as the seasons rise and fall,     And the men"]]]
