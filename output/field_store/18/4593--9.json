[Illustration: _Fig. 133._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 134._]    THE DIRECTION OF LIGHT.--Now, in drawing, we must observe another thing.  Not only does the light always come from above, but it comes also from  the left side. I show in Fig. 132 two squares, one within the other. All  the lines are of the same thickness. Can you determine by means of such  a drawing what the inner square represents? Is it a block, or raised  surface, or is it a depression?    RAISED SURFACES.--Fig. 133 shows it in the form of a block, simply by  thickening the lower and the right-hand lines.    DEPRESSED SURFACES.--If, by chance, you should make the upper and the  left-hand lines heavy, as in Fig. 134, it would, undoubtedly, appear  depressed, and would need no further explanation.    FULL SHADING,--But, in order to furnish an additional example of the  effect of shading, suppose we shade the surface of the large square, as  shown in Fig. 135, and you will at once see that not only is the effect  emphasized, but it all the more clearly expresses what you want to show.  In like manner, in Fig. 136, we shade only the space within the inner  square, and it is only too obvious how shadows give us surface  conformation.    [Illustration: _Fig. 135._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 136._]    ILLUSTRATING CUBE SHADING.--In Fig. 137 I show merely nine lines joined  together, all lines being of equal thickness.    As thus drawn it may represent, for instance, a cube, or it may show  simply a square base (A) with two sides (B, B) of equal dimensions.    SHADING EFFECTS.--Now, to examine it properly so as to observe what the  draughtsman wishes to express, look at Fig. 138, in which the three  diverging lines (A, B, C) are increased in thickness, and the cube  appears plainly. On the other hand, in Fig. 139, the thickening of the  lines (D, E, F) shows an entirely different structure.    [Illustration: _Fig. 137._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 138._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 139._]    It must be remembered, therefore, that to show raised surfaces the  general direction is to shade heavily the lower horizontal and the right  vertical lines. (See Fig. 133.)    HEAVY LINES.--But there is an exception to this rule. See two examples  (Fig. 140). Here two parallel lines appear close together to form the  edge nearest the eye. In such cases the second, or upper, line is  heaviest. On vertical lines, as in Fig. 141, the second line from the  right is heaviest. These examples show plain geometrical lines, and  those from Figs. 138 to 141, inclusive, are in perspective.    [Illustration: _Fig. 140._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 141._]    PERSPECTIVE.--A perspective is a most deceptive figure, and a cube, for  instance, may be drawn so that the various lines will differ in length,  and also be equidistant from each other. Or all the lines may be of the  same length and have the distances between them vary. Supposing we have  two cubes, one located above the other, separated, say, two feet or more  from each other. It is obvious that the lines of the two cubes will not  be the same to a camera, because, if they were photographed, they would  appear exactly as they are, so far as their positions are concerned, and  not as they appear. But the cubes do appear to the eye as having six  equal sides. The camera shows that they do not have six equal sides so  far as measurement is concerned. You will see, therefore, that the  position of the eye, relative to the cube, is what determines the angle,  or $the relative$ angles of all the lines.    [Illustration: _Fig. 142._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 143._]    A TRUE PERSPECTIVE OF A CUBE.--Fig. 142 shows a true perspective--that  is, it is true from the measurement standpoint. It is what is called an  _isometrical_ view, or a figure in which all the lines not only are of  equal length, but the parallel lines are all spaced apart the same  distances from each other.    ISOMETRIC CUBE.--I enclose this cube within a circle, as in Fig. 143. To  form this cube the circle (A) is drawn and bisected with a vertical line  (B). This forms the starting point for stepping off the six points (C)  in the circle, using the dividers without resetting, after you have made  the circle. Then connect each of the points (C) by straight lines (D).  These lines are called chords. From the center draw two lines (E) at an  angle and one line (F) vertically. These are the radial lines. You will  see from the foregoing that the chords (D) form the outline of the  cube--or the lines farthest from the eye, and the radial lines (E, F)  are the nearest to the eye. In this position we are looking at the block  at a true diagonal--that is, from a corner at one side to the extreme  corner on the opposite side.    [Illustration: _Fig. 144._]    Let us contrast this, and particularly Fig. 142, with the cube which is  placed higher up, viewed from the same standpoint.    FLATTENED PERSPECTIVE.--Fig. 144 shows the new perspective, in which the  three vertical lines (A, A, A) are of equal length, and the six  angularly disposed lines (B, C) are of equal length, but shorter than  the lines A. The only change which has been made is to shorten the  distance across the corner from D to D, but the vertical lines (A) are  the same in length as the corresponding lines in Fig. 143.  Notwithstanding this change the cubes in both figures appear to be of  the same size, as, in fact, they really are.    [Illustration: _Fig. 145._]    In forming a perspective, therefore, it would be a good idea for the boy  to have a cube of wood always at hand, which, if laid down on a  horizontal support, alongside, or within range of the object to be  drawn, will serve as a guide to the perspective.    TECHNICAL DESIGNATIONS.--As all geometrical lines have designations, I  have incorporated such figures as will be most serviceable to the boy,  each figure being accompanied by its proper definition.    [Illustration: _Fig. 146._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 147._]    Before passing to that subject I can better show some of the simple  forms by means of suitable diagrams.    Referring to Fig. 145, let us direct our attention to the body (G),  formed by the line (D) across the circle. This body is called a segment.  A chord (D) and a curve comprise a segment.    SECTOR AND SEGMENT.--Now examine the shape of the body formed by two of  the radial lines (E, E) and that part of the circle which extends from  one radial line to the other. The body thus formed is a sector, and it  is made by two radiating lines and a curved line. Learn to distinguish  readily, in your mind, the difference between the two figures.    TERMS OF ANGLES.--The relation of the lines to each other, the manner in  which they are joined together, and their comparative angles, all have  special terms and meanings. Thus, referring to the isometric cube, in  Fig. 145, the angle formed at the center by the lines (B, E) is  different from the angle formed at the margin by the lines (E, F). The  angle formed by B, E is called an exterior angle; and that formed by E,  F is an interior angle. If you will draw a line (G) from the center to  the circle line, so it intersects it at C, the lines B, D, G form an  equilateral or isosceles triangle; if you draw a chord (A) from C to C,  the lines H, E, F will form an obtuse triangle, and B, F, H a  right-angled triangle.    CIRCLES AND CURVES.--Circles, and, in fact, all forms of curved work,  are the most difficult for beginners. The simplest figure is the circle,  which, if it represents a raised surface, is provided with a heavy line  on the lower right-hand side, as in Fig. 146; but the proper artistic  expression is shown in Fig. 147, in which the lower right-hand side is  shaded in rings running only a part of the way around, gradually  diminishing in length, and spaced farther and farther apart as you  approach the center, thus giving the appearance of a sphere.    [Illustration: _Fig. 148._]    IRREGULAR CURVES.--But the irregular curves require the most care to  form properly. Let us try first the elliptical curve (Fig. 148). The  proper thing is, first, to draw a line (A), which is called the \"major  axis.\" On this axis we mark for our guidance two points (B, B). With the  dividers find a point (C) exactly midway, and draw a cross line (D).  This is called the \"minor axis.\" If we choose to do so we may indicate  two points (E, E) on the minor axis, which, in this case, for  convenience, are so spaced that the distance along the major axis,  between B, B, is twice the length across the minor axis (D), along E, E.  Now find one-quarter of the distance from B to C, as at F, and with a  compass pencil make a half circle (G). If, now, you will set the compass  point on the center mark (C), and the pencil point of the compass on B,  and measure along the minor axis (D) on both sides of the major axis,  you will make two points, as at H. These points are your centers for  scribing the long sides of the ellipse. Before proceeding to strike the  curved lines (J), draw a diagonal line (K) from H to each marking point  (F). Do this on both sides of the major axis, and produce these lines so  they cross the curved lines (G). When you ink in your ellipse do not  allow the circle pen to cross the lines (K), and you will have a  mechanical ellipse.    ELLIPSES AND OVALS.--It is not necessary to measure the centering points  (F) at certain specified distances from the intersection of the  horizontal and vertical lines. We may take any point along the major  axis, as shown, for instance, in Fig. 149. Let B be this point, taken at  random. Then describe the half circle (C). We may, also, arbitrarily,  take any point, as, for instance, D on the minor axis E, and by drawing  the diagonal lines (F) we find marks on the circle (C), which are the  meeting lines for the large curve (H), with the small curve (C).
