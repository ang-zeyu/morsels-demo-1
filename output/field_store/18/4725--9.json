[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23860"],[0,"The Young Man's Guide (#12)"],[1," daylight. Indeed, I was intimately  acquainted with one man who laid out the business of the day, attended  family worship, and breakfasted before sunrise; and this too, at all  seasons of the year.    Morning gowns and slippers are very useful things, it is said. But the  reasons given for their utility are equally in favor of _always_  wearing them. 'They are loose and comfortable.' Very well: Should not  our dress always be loose? 'They save _other clothes_.' Then why not  wear them all day long? The truth, after all, is, that they are  _fashionable_, and as we usually give the _true_ reason for a thing  _last_, this is probably the principal reason why they are so much in  use. I am pretty well convinced, however, that they are of little real  use to him who is determined to eat his bread 'in the sweat of his  face,' according to the Divine appointment.    Looking-glasses are useful in their place, but like many other  conveniences of life, by no means indispensable; and so much abused,  that a man of sense would almost be tempted, for the sake of example,  to lay them aside. Of all wasted time, none is more _foolishly_ wasted  than that which is employed in _unnecessary_ looking at one's own  pretty face.    This may seem a matter of small consequence; but nothing can be of  small importance to which we are obliged to attend _every day_. If we  dressed or shaved but once a year, or once a month, the case would be  altered; but this is a piece of work that must be done once every day;  and, as it may cost only about _five minutes_ of time, and may be, and  frequently is, made to cost _thirty_, or even _fifty minutes_; and, as  only fifteen minutes make about a fiftieth part of the hours of our  average daylight; this being the case, it is a matter of real  importance.    SIR JOHN SINCLAIR asked a friend whether he meant to have a son of his  (then a little boy) taught Latin? 'No,' said he, 'but I mean to do  something a great deal better for him.' 'What is that?' said Sir John.  'Why,' said the other, 'I mean to teach him _to shave with cold water,  and without a glass_.'    My readers may smile, but I can assure them that Sir John is not alone.  There are many others who have adopted this practice, and found it  highly beneficial. One individual, who had tried it for years, has the  following spirited remarks on the subject.    'Only think of the inconvenience attending the common practice! There  must be _hot water_; to have this there must be _a fire_, and, in some  cases, a fire for that purpose alone; to have these, there must be a  _servant_, or you must light a fire yourself. For the want of these,  the job is put off until a later hour: this causes a stripping and  another dressing bout: or, you go in a slovenly state all that day, and  the next day the thing must be done, or cleanliness must be abandoned  altogether. If you are on a journey, you must wait the pleasure of the  servants at the inn before you can dress and set out in the morning;  the pleasant time for travelling is gone before you can move from the  spot: instead of being at the end of your day's journey in good time,  you are benighted, and have to endure all the great inconveniences  attendant on tardy movements. And all this from the apparently  insignificant affair of shaving. How many a piece of important business  has failed from a short delay! And how many thousand of such delays  daily proceed from this unworthy cause!'    These remarks are especially important to those persons in  boarding-houses and elsewhere, for whom hot water, if they use it, must  be expressly prepared.    Let me urge you never to say I cannot go, or do such a thing, till I am  shaved or dressed. Take care always to BE _shaved and dressed_, and  then you will always be ready to act. But to this end the habit must be  formed in early life, and pertinaciously adhered to.    There are those who can truly say that to the habit of adhering to the  principles which have been laid down, they owe much of their success in  life; that however sober, discreet, and abstinent they might have been,  they never could have accomplished much without it. We should suppose  by reasoning beforehand, that the _army_ could not be very favorable to  steady habits of this or any other kind; yet the following is the  testimony of one who had made the trial.    'To the habit of early rising and husbanding my time well, more than to  any other thing, I owed my very extraordinary promotion in the army. I  was _always ready_. If I had to mount guard at _ten_, I was ready at  _nine_: never did any man, or any thing, wait one moment for me. Being,  at an age _under twenty years_, raised from corporal to sergeant major  _at once_, over the heads of thirty sergeants, I should naturally have  been an object of envy and hatred; but this habit of early rising  really subdued these passions.    'Before my promotion, a clerk was wanted to make out the morning report  of the regiment. I rendered the clerk unnecessary; and, long before any  other man was dressed for the parade, my work for the morning was all  done, and I myself was on the parade ground, walking, in fine weather,  for an hour perhaps.    'My custom was this: to get up, in summer, at daylight, and in winter  at four o'clock; shave, dress, even to the putting of my sword-belt  over my shoulder, and having my sword lying on the table before me,  ready to hang by my side. Then I ate a bit of cheese, or pork, and  bread. Then I prepared my report, which was filled up as fast as the  companies brought me in the materials. After this, I had an hour or two  to read, before the time came for any duty out of doors, unless when  the regiment, or part of it, went out to exercise in the morning. When  this was the case, and the matter was left to me, I always had it on  the ground in such time as that the bayonets glistened in the _rising  sun_; a sight which gave me delight, of which I often think, but which  I should in vain endeavor to describe.    'If the _officers_ were to go out, eight or ten o'clock was the hour.  Sweating men in the heat of the day, or breaking in upon the time for  cooking their dinner, puts all things out of order, and all men out of  humor. When I was commander, the men had a long day of leisure before  them: they could ramble into the town or into the woods; go to get  raspberries, to catch birds, to catch fish, or to pursue any other  recreation, and such of them as chose, and were qualified, to work at  their trades. So that here, arising solely from the early habits of one  very young man, were pleasant and happy days given to hundreds.'    For my own part, I confess that only a few years since, I should have  laughed heartily at some of these views, especially the cold water  system of shaving. But a friend whom I esteemed, and who shaved with  cold water, said so much in its favor that I ventured to make the  trial; and I can truly say that I would not return to my former slavery  to hot water, if I had a servant who had nothing else to do but furnish  it. I cannot indeed say with a recent writer (I think in the Journal of  Health) that cold water is a great deal _better_ than warm; but I can  and do say that it makes little if any difference with me which I use;  though on going out into the cold air immediately afterward, the skin  is more likely to chap after the use of warm water than cold. Besides I  think the use of warm water more likely to produce eruptions on the  skin.--Sometimes, though not generally, I shave, like Sir John  Sinclair, without a glass; but I would never be enslaved to one,  convenient as it is.      SECTION XV. _Bathing and Cleanliness._    Cleanliness of the body has, some how or other, such a connection with  mental and moral purity, (whether as cause or effect--or both--I will  not undertake now to determine) that I am unwilling to omit the present  opportunity of urging its importance. There are those who are so  attentive to this subject as to wash their whole bodies in water,  either cold or warm, every day of the year; and never to wear the same  clothes, during the day, that they have slept in the previous night.  Now this habit may by some be called whimsical; but I think it deserves  a _better name_. I consider this extreme, if it ought to be called an  extreme, as vastly more safe than the common extreme of _neglect_.    Is it not shameful--_would_ it not be, were human duty properly  understood--to pass months, and even years, without washing the whole  body once? There are thousands and tens of thousands of both sexes, who  are exceedingly nice, even to fastidiousness, about externals;--who,  like those mentioned in the gospel, keep clean the 'outside of the cup  and the platter,'--but alas! how is it within? Not a few of  us,--living, as we do, in a land where soap and water are abundant and  cheap--would blush, if the whole story were told.    This chapter, if extended so far as to embrace the whole subject of  cleanliness of person, dress, and apartments, and cold and warm  bathing, would alone fill a volume; a volume too, which, if well  prepared, would be of great value, especially to all young men. But my  present limits do not permit of any thing farther. In regard to _cold  bathing_, however, allow me to refer you to two articles in the third  volume of the Annals of Education, pages 315 and 344, which contain the  best directions I can give on this subject.      SECTION XVI. _On Little Things._    There are many things which, viewed without any reference to prevailing  habits, manners, and customs, appear utterly unworthy of attention; and  yet, after all, much of our happiness will be found to depend upon  them. We are to remember that we live--not alone, on the earth--but  among a _multitude_, each of whom claims, and is entitled to his own  estimate of things. Now it often happens that what _we_ deem a _little_  thing, another, who views the subject"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23875"],[0,"The Relief of Mafeking (#12)"],[1,"and sat all day in the bowels of  the earth. Men walking in the streets jumped if a mule kicked an iron  plate; they screamed when the signal was given; they broke and ran and  burrowed into shelter. Yet so fast do some men anchor themselves to  routine that many kept their offices open and did business--all the  while, however, with one eye on the paper and the other glancing through  the door or window; ever with one ear turned to the speaker and the  other noting the rustle of paper stirred by the breeze and the hum of  wind under the door.    That only twenty people were killed is no fact at all in connection with  the panic; what really matters is that seventy times a day something  happened which might have killed a dozen people.    I have only to add, in case I am accused of exaggerating the state of  terror, that the people who went through this ordeal have not  necessarily the clearest conception of it. I came out of the safe outer  world and saw their faces and eyes, and, if I had not heard a word, I  should have known.    One other thing. A despatch sent by me to _The Manchester Guardian_  contained this sentence complimentary to the De Beers Company: \"The  condition of the town would have been deplorable but for the relief  administration of the De Beers Company.\"    That sentence was not made, but suggested by my good friend the censor;  and it will serve to indicate how great was the bowing down before the  house of De Beers. I wish to disavow any compliment I may have appeared  to pay that company in my telegram, for I think they did their bare  duty. What they did was to provide a ration of soup for the inhabitants  as long as some bullock meat which they possessed lasted; to organise  relief works by making roads and fences in a town which belongs chiefly  to themselves; and to allow people to shelter in their mines. Perhaps  they could do no more. Considering everything, and remembering some  facts in connection with this and other political troubles, I ask, Could  they well have done less?          VIII    PAARDEBERG      From Modder River to Paardeberg the road rolls over a bare yet beautiful  plain, brown and dry before the rain, but after a heavy rain bursting  into endless stretches of purple and scarlet flowers of the karoo. I  went by Jacobsdaal. Early on Wednesday morning, February 28th, I rode  out from the little town with General Wavell, who put me a couple of  miles on the road. You are to understand that this was something of an  adventure. I had nothing but a Cape cart and a couple of horses to draw  it--a thing that holds, with one's kit, about three hundred pounds of  forage. I was going to a camp where I could get no forage and hardly any  food; there was not a despatch-rider to be had at Modder; my telegrams  must be ridden back from the front, now thirty and soon to be ninety  miles away. Sickness had tethered me to Modder River camp throughout the  exciting week that had ended with Cronje's surrender; and now on  February 28th I was following the army, feeling like one who should  enter a theatre as the curtain was falling on the first act.    The thirty-mile ride through the lonely country would have been  delightful but for the dismal trail left by the war--carcases of horses  and oxen lining the road, a carcase every few hundred yards surrounded  by a gorged flock of aasvoegels, the foulest of the vulture tribe. With a  nervous horse the passage of these pestilential spots was made difficult  as well as revolting, and it was with a feeling of relief that one saw  the tents and waggons of the Paardeberg camp by the river trees.    Along the road, I should have said, the trail was one of devastation. In  the midst of the dry veldt one sometimes came upon a farmhouse with its  grove of trees, and spring, and pleasant fields; but always the farm was  derelict, windows broken, rooms gutted, stock destroyed, with often some  poor abandoned creature tethered to a tree, and waiting, in the midst of  the dead silence of the empty country, to be fed and watered.    At Paardeberg I found the headquarters camp situated on the river bank,  a place pretty to look at but horrible to be near. The only water to  drink was that from a well by the river--water of a dark and strange  colour; and even while one drank it one sat and watched the carcases of  horses floating down the brown stream from the deserted Boer laager a  mile above. For Cronje and his men had surrendered, not only because of  losses or lack of ammunition, but chiefly, it was said, because the same  conditions that made our camp almost unbearable made his laager in the  river-bed impossible for human accommodation. So he surrendered, after a  resistance that will live in history as one of the bravest pieces of  human endurance.    On my way down I had met a great company of men moving over the plain  surrounded by mounted infantry. These were our prisoners--a noble bag of  more than four thousand. But now that they had gone there was no reason  why the camp should be maintained at Paardeberg, and at noon we  proceeded to thread our way eastward--a long procession of men and  horses and waggons--to the farm of Osfontein, where the force was being  concentrated for the final advance. The delay was fortunate for the  correspondents, for those of us who had only a scanty stock of  provisions and forage could send our carts back once more to Modder for  a supply. In the meantime nothing was likely to happen until a  fortnight's stock of provisions and forage for the army had been  collected.    Before leaving Paardeberg, and in the intervals of arranging the mere  details of living--which on this line of advance were harassing and  formidable--I rode over to the deserted Boer laager, or as near to it as  was safe. The scene was strange and significant. Imagine the river, deep  down between steep terraced banks, flowing through the level plain. On  the left side our position, well entrenched, with a few kopjes about two  thousand yards from the bank. On the right was the enemy's position,  which extended further down the banks of the river and up to the very  edge of our side. On the far bank I saw a line of hundreds of transport  waggons and carts, all empty, many of them smashed and broken by our  shell fire. But it was the river-bed itself that was most interesting.  The water was very low, and there was any amount of cover on the steep  banks, and this was increased by a number of small pits or trenches--not  long trenches like ours, but simple little holes or graves dug in the  banks, with room enough for a couple of men. Graves they proved to be in  many cases, for where the Boers were shot in them the trenches were  simply filled in and the bodies thus rudely buried. But how independent  they were! No bulky commissariat department, no army of cooks and  butchers--every man with his own kettle and biltong or canned beef, his  own rug or sleeping bag, his own water-bottle; so that when he came into  such a position as this he could remain in it for days together. One saw  many pathetic things in these trenches--garments and personal belongings  evidently made by hands that did not work for hire.    In two trenches I found Dutch Bibles; in one a diary of the last few  weeks; in almost all some sign that human beings and not machines had  been at work there; and on all sides spent shells and shrapnel cases and  cartridges, to remind one of the nature of their work. When one  followed, as I had followed so far, in the shadow of the war and not in  the midst of it, in the track of the Red Cross and the wayside cemetery  instead of within sound and sight of the thing itself, one saw a very  dark and unrelieved side of it--the shadow without the substance, the  effect without the cause.          PART III    LORD ROBERTS'S ADVANCE TO BLOEMFONTEIN          IX    THE BOER PANIC AT OSFONTEIN      The carefully prepared attack of Lord Roberts on the Boer position at  Osfontein was delivered on Wednesday, March 7th, with the result that  the enemy fled without attempting to defend his extremely strong  position. To understand the gravity of the attack you must have been  there during the last few days of preparation, when hills and ridges,  subsequently abandoned in a moment, were being strengthened and armed  with trenches and guns. On Sunday and Monday, the 4th and 5th of March,  I rode round the whole position, and, like everyone else, was led to  expect a very severe struggle. The position was roughly this. The great  plain through which the river winds is broken five miles east of  Osfontein by a long range of kopjes extending about fourteen miles north  and south. All these kopjes were until the day of our attack occupied by  a force of 7,000 Boers, but to the west of them were a few lower hills  and ridges which we held. We did not know exactly how far to the east  the Boer kopjes extended; that is to say, we did not know how broad  might be the line of their defences; all we knew was that there were  other kopjes to the eastward, and that the enemy probably held them. Our  force, 30,000 strong, was disposed over a square of perhaps eight miles;  yet if you had ridden all day in circles round the farm of Osfontein,  which was Lord Roberts's headquarters, you might have wondered whether  there were even 5,000 men, so scattered were our camps. The whole air of  the place was that of almost pastoral quietness, and the only sound to  be heard was the lowing of oxen.    Out in the advanced pickets the silence was deeper, but it was not  pastoral. I rode out on the Monday to a little kopje, our most advanced  post--a place within rifle range of the opposite Boer position, about  2,000 yards away. Over the plain, here green and sweet with the smell of  tiny flowers newly burst out by the heavy rains, I rode out from under  the shelter of a big kopje held by Kitchener's Horse. Between it and the  little hill held by the picket"]]]
