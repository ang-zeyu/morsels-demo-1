If ever the tympanum was           simply painted or filled with a group in terracotta, it is easy           to see why the fashion died and why consequently we can bring           forward no direct proof to-day. It was simply that only figures           in the round can satisfy the requirements of a pedimental           composition. The strong shadows thrown by the cornice, the           distance from the spectator, and the height, must combine to           confuse the lines of a scene painted on a plane surface, or           even of a low relief. So soon as this was discovered and so           soon as the art of sculpture found itself able to supply the           want, a new period in pedimental decoration began.             Literary evidence to support this theory of the origin of           pediment sculpture is not lacking. Pliny says in his Natural  Page 34  History (xxxv. 156.): _Laudat_ (Varro) _et Pasitelen           qui plasticen matrem caelaturæ et statuariæ sculpturaeque dixit           et cum esset in omnibus his summus nihil unquam fecit antequam           finxit_. Also (xxxiv. 35.): _Similitudines exprimendi quae           prima fuerit origo, in ea quam plasticen Graeci vocant dici           convenientius erit, etenim prior quam statuaria fuit_. In both           these cases the meaning of \"plasticen\" is clearly working, that           is, moulding, in clay. Pliny, again (xxxv. 152.), tells us of           the Corinthian Butades: _Butadis inventum est rubricam addere           aut ex rubra creta fingere, primusque personas tegularum           extremis imbricibus inposuit, quae inter initia prostypa           vocavit, postea idem ectypa fecit. hinc et fastigia templorum           orta_. The phrase _hinc et fastigia templorum orla_, has been           bracketed by some editors because they could not believe the           fact which it stated. _Fastigia_ may from the whole connection           and the Latin mean \"pediments.\" This is quite in accord with           the famous passage in Pindar,[54] attributing to the           Corinthians the invention of pedimental composition. Here then           we have stated approximately the conclusion which seems at           least probable on other grounds, namely, that the tympanum of           the pediment was originally filled with a group in terracotta,           beyond doubt painted and in low relief.             [Footnote 54: _Olymp._, XIII, 21.]             But if we assume that the pedimental group could have           originated in this way, we must be prepared to explain the           course of its development up to the pediments of Aegina and the           Parthenon, in which we find an entirely different principle,           namely, the filling of these tympana with figures in the round.           It is maintained by some scholars, notably by Koepp,[55] that           no connection can be established between high relief and low           relief, much less between statues entirely in the round and low           relief. High relief follows all the principles of sculpture,           while low relief may almost be considered as a branch of the           painter's art. But this view seems opposed to the evidence of           the facts. For there still exists a continuous series of           pedimental groups, first in low relief then in high relief, and           finally standing altogether free from the background, and           becoming sculpture in the round. Examples in low relief are the           Hydra pediment from the Acropolis and the pediment of the  Page 35  Megarian Treasury at Olympia, which, on artistic grounds, can           be set down as the two earliest now in existence. Then follow,           in order of time and development, the Triton and Typhon           pediments, in high relief, from the Acropolis; and after these           the idea of relief is lost, and the pediment becomes merely a           space destined to be adorned with statuary. Can we reasonably           believe that the Hydra and Triton pediments, standing side by           side on the Acropolis, so close to each other in time and in           technic, owe their origin to entirely different motives, merely           for the reason that the figures of one stand further out from           the background than those of the other? Is it not easier to           suppose that the higher reliefs, as they follow the older low           reliefs in time, are developed from them, than to assume that           just at the dividing-line a new principle came into operation?             [Footnote 55: _Jahrbuch deutschen archäol. Instituts_, II,           118.]             It is a commonplace to say that sculpture in relief is only one           branch of painting. Conze[56] publishes a sepulchral monument           which seems to him to mark the first stage of growth. The           surface of the figure and that of the surrounding ground remain           the same; they are separated only by a shallow incised line.           Conze says of it; \"The tracing of the outline is no more than,           and is in fact exactly the same as, the tracing employed by the           Greek vase-painter when he outlined his figure with a brush           full of black paint before he filled in with black the ground           about it.\" The next step naturally is to cut away the surface           outside and beyond the figures; the representation is still a           picture except in the clearer marking of the bounding-line. The           entire further growth and development of the Greek relief is in           the direction of rounding these lines and of detaching the           relief more and more from the back surface. This primitive           picturesque method of treatment is found as well in high relief           as in low. How then can the process of development be different           for the two? I quote from Friedrichs-Wolters[57] on the metopes           of the temple of Apollon at Selinous, which are distinctly in           high relief: \"The relief of these works stands very near to the           origin of relief-style. The surface of the figures is kept flat           throughout, although the effort to represent them in their full  Page 36  roundness is not to be mistaken. Only later were relief-figures           rounded on the front and sides after the manner of free           figures. Originally, whether in high or in low relief, they           were flat forms, modelled for the plane surface whose ornament           they were to be.\" As the sculptured works were brought out           further and further from the background, this background tended           to disappear. It was no longer a distinctly marked surface on           which the figures were projected, but now higher and now lower,           serving only to hold the figures together. When this point was           reached, the entire separation of the figures from one another           and from the background, became easy. That is, the change in           conception is an easy step by which the relief was lost and           free-standing figures substituted. This process of change was           especially rapid in pedimental groups, for the reason stated           above. The pediment field from its architectonic conditions was           never suited to decoration in relief. But we find from the           works before us that such a system was at least attempted, that           painting and an increased projection of relief were employed as           aids. We are bound to seek a logical explanation of the facts           and of their bearing on the later history of art, and it is           safer to assume a process of regular development than a series           of anomalous changes. Koepp (_cf. supra_), for example, assumes           that these two pediments in low relief are simply exceptions to           the general rule, accounting for them by the fact that it was           difficult to work out high reliefs from the poros stone of           which they were made. He seems to forget that the higher           reliefs from the Acropolis are of the same poros. This material           in fact appears to have been chosen by the artist because it           was almost as easy to incise and carve as the wood and clay to           which he had been accustomed. The monuments of later Greek art           give no hint of a distinction to be drawn between high and low           relief. We find on the same stele figures barely attached to           the ground, and others in mere outline. If then there are           reasons for finding the origin of pedimental decoration in a           plane or low-relief composition of terracotta, made more           effective both by a framing of like material and technic, and           by the acroteria at either extremity and above, then the           process of development which leads at length to the pediments           at Aegina and the Parthenon becomes at once easy and natural.           We note first the change from terracotta to a low painted  Page 37  relief in stone, then this relief becomes, from the necessities           of the case, higher and higher until finally it gives place to           free figures.             [Footnote 56: _Das Relief bei den Griechen. Sitzungs-Berichte           der Berliner Akademie_, 1882, 567.]             [Footnote 57: _Gipsabgüsse antiker Bilderwerke_, Nos. 149-151.]             If ceramic art really did exert such an influence on           temple-sculpture, we should be able to trace analogies in other           lines. The most interesting is found in the design and           execution of sepulchral monuments. Milchhoefer[58] is of the           opinion that the tomb was not originally marked by an upright           slab with sculptured figures."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2016"],[0,"The 1998 CIA World Factbook (#12)"],[1,"20, vehicle carrier 1  note: a flag of convenience registry: Germany owns 11 ships, Slovenia  3, Cyprus 2, and US 1 (1997 est.)
