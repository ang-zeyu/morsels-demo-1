The chance of making-up doesn't come every day.\"    \"We must have a chance of getting even with them first, and then we'll  talk about stopping.\"    \"Nonsense! You know that tit-for-tat's a game without an end!\"    \"My dear Brady, if you knew the toil and time it has cost me to gather  this bunch of crawly, you wouldn't ask me so lightly to waste it.\"    \"If that's all,\" said Jack, \"you can stick the whole lot down my neck. I  give you free leave. Go on!\"    There is no stronger influence than earnestness, and Jack was intensely  in earnest. It had its effect on his listeners, who were almost won over  already, while he thought his efforts were thrown away. While he spoke,  Simmons had secretly released three earwigs with which he had meant  mischief, and Hughes was opening his mouth to utter a word or two for  Jack, when Cadbury glided up to the group with outspread arms, and a  square box balanced on his head.    \"Pax tea-cup! pax O biscuit!\" began the flippant boy. \"Dear brethren, I  entreat you to join with me in smoking the calumet of peace in the shape  of this humble weed.\"    As he bowed, the box fell from his head into his hands, and, removing  the lid, he offered it round. It appeared to contain a double layer of  cigars; but the Brincliffe scholars knew these cigars well, and where  they came from. They were composed of almond paste, and coated with a  brown sugary paper, which was always consumed with the rest.    Jack almost held his breath. Would the boys refuse or accept them?    Hughes dipped his hand in at once with a smile and a nod. \"Thanks very  much, Cadbury!\" Simmons followed suit with a wicked little chuckle.  Bacon hesitated, and then helped himself awkwardly. Frere took one with  an \"Oo!\" of appreciation. Now it was Mason's turn. If Jack had been a  recruiting sergeant, and the sugar cigar the Queen's shilling, he could  scarcely have felt more anxious.    Mason put forward his thumb and finger, then hesitated and looked at  Jack with a twinkle in his eye.    \"Now, shall I, Brady?\"    [Illustration]    Jack nodded. He really dared not speak, for fear Mason should take it  into his head to go exactly contrary to him.    Hurrah! The cigar was taken!    From that moment Cadbury and Jack turned themselves into a couple of the  maddest, silliest clowns imaginable. But there was method in their  madness. Though they did not even own it to each other, they were making  themselves ridiculous and foolish to prevent the rest from feeling so.  Boys loathe sentiment, and many a quarrel drifts on and on, simply  because each party dreads \"being made to feel a fool\".    At Brincliffe on this particular day the two sides felt distinctly shy  of each other, and it was a real boon to have a pair of \"giddy lunatics\"  to scream at.    But when Cadbury had boxed Frere's ears for giving the dates of the  royal Georges correctly, and when Simmons had sharpened his pencil with  Vickers's knife without asking leave, the relations between boarders and  day-pupils grew easier.           *       *       *       *       *    There were few idle wheel-barrows in Elmridge on Saturday afternoon.    If you had passed along the dusty Brickland Road between four and five  o'clock, you would have encountered a droll procession. One passer-by  stopped to enquire if there was going to be a Battle of Flowers.    Six barrows, laden with flowering plants, each pulled by two boys, and  pushed by one, were slowly but steadily travelling towards the town, and  at the rear of all was a bath-chair in charge of Hallett and Armitage,  wherein sat a thin, delicate-looking man, whose bright eyes and flushed  cheeks spoke eloquently of gratitude and pleasure. That bath-chair was  Hallett's own idea, and he was very proud of it.           *       *       *       *       *    It was a warm and weary company of boy-labourers who gathered at eight  o'clock that evening round a very tempting supper-table, spread in the  Brincliffe dining-room, to which, by special invitation, the day-pupils  sat down with the boarders. But every face was bright, and the meal was  the merriest ever known.    By Mr. West's direction, the boys were left to enjoy it \"un-mastered\".    The clatter of knives and spoons had almost ceased when Vickers rose  slowly to his feet, a glass of ginger-beer in his hand. He was impelled  to do so by the nudges of his neighbours, Green and Mason. His rising  was received with loud applause, which he acknowledged with a grave bow.    \"I have been very much pressed--elbow-pressed,\" he began, \"to get up and  say something. I scarcely see why I should be pitched on, unless it is  because I have more brass than the rest of you. (Hear, hear.) Anyhow,  here I am, and I'll ask three questions and then sit down. First\"--and  up came one finger--\"Isn't this the jolliest supper we've ever had?  (Cries of \"Yes!\") Very well, I'll tell you why. Reason Number One:  West's in a jolly good temper, _vide_ the groaning table and the absence  of masters. Reason Number Two: We're all in a jolly good temper, and  have done a jolly good day's work. Now, secondly--(Shouts of \"Thirdly,  you mean, old man!\") I mean what I say--Secondly! We had two divisions  under the first head. You may have got confused, but I haven't.  Secondly, then, we're all pretty thoroughly fagged: is anyone sorry he's  fagged? (No!) Well, the job wasn't my idea, or West's idea. But it was  somebody's, and I think we all know whose. The same somebody who has  annoyed us all horribly in the past by refusing to so much as do one  ill-natured thing. The same somebody who has steadily prevented us from  quarrelling comfortably and consistently, as we wanted to, and has  finally dragged us into this unhappy state of good-fellowship. Now for  my thirdly: Will you drink with me to that somebody's health?\"    The question was received with shouting and banging, while the words,  \"Bravo, Vickers! Here's to good old Brady!\" \"I drink to Jack of Both  Sides!\" \"Here's to you, Jack!\" \"Speech, Brady--speech!\" and similar  cries filled the air.    Poor Jack felt extremely ill at ease, and not at all grateful to  Vickers. He studied his plate with the closest attention, his face  growing redder and redder each moment. Then Cadbury thumped him on the  back, and Hallett and Bacon fairly forced him to his feet. But a speech  was quite beyond Jack at that minute.    \"I say, sha'n't we beg the release of the March Hare?\" was all he said,  and the first person he looked at was Armitage.    Armitage, too, was the first to cry back, \"Yes!\"    The petition, which was written and signed before they separated, was  received favourably, and the following Monday saw the return of the  March Hare to his place in the school, scared, penitent, and profoundly  grateful to all his school-fellows, including Armitage. And he insisted  on pressing Jack's hand to his lips, which made our hero feel  excessively uncomfortable. But for the remainder of the term, the use of  a knife, even at dinner, was denied the little Italian.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Brady, have you missed anything?\" asked Cadbury a few days later.    \"No, I don't think so,\" replied Jack, feeling doubtfully in his pockets.    \"Because you have certainly lost something,\" continued Cadbury.    \"Well, give it me quick, then,\" said Jack, laughing. \"Whatever is it?\"    \"I can't give it you. It's gone for ever,\" was the rejoinder. \"You'll  never have it again.\"    \"Well, what was it, then? Nothing valuable, I hope?\"    \"When two things are made into one thing, you can't speak of them any  longer as 'both'; can you?\"    \"Fetch us a grammar, Toppin,\" said Jack. \"We're getting out of our  depths. Have I lost two things, please, Cadbury, or only one?\"    \"Don't frivol, Jack! listen to me. We are all one-sided now, so you have  lost your title. You can never again be called Jack of Both Sides.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20386"],[0,"Embroidery and Tapestry Weaving (#12)"],[1," thread outline gives a nice finish to laid work. If there is  nothing in the way of an outline, and the pattern and ground are both  covered with laid threads, the edges of the pattern are likely to look  weak. Fig. 94 shows a leaf filled in with rather loosely laid threads  and outlined and veined with gold passing, the veining answering the  double purpose of fixing down the laid threads and veining the leaf at  the same time.    In this work, the colouring is frequently in flat tones, but if  necessary it is quite easy to introduce gradation. Further variety can  be obtained by a contrast in colour in the tying-down threads.      APPLIED WORK    The ancient Latin term _opus consutum_, and the modern French one  _applique_, which is perhaps the name most commonly in use, both refer  to the same kind of work; what is now called cut work is quite  different from this, and is described elsewhere. Under the heading of  applied work comes anything that, cut out of one material, is applied to  another; it may have been previously embroidered, or it may be just the  plain stuff. Both kinds can, as has been proved, be carried out with  excellent effect, but much unsuitable and badly designed work has been  done by this method, with the result that the very name has fallen into  disrepute.    The simplest kind of applied work is that in which the design, traced  upon one material, then cut out along the outline of the pattern, is  applied to another material, the junction of the two materials being  hidden by a cord or suitable stitch. The applied work is most often  flat, but it can be in slight or in strong relief. The texture of the  materials employed may be an important factor in the result, for a  contrast in material as well as in colour is often wanted; sometimes the  former alone is sufficient. The choice of material depends very much  upon the use to which the finished work will be put, but this simple  form of applied work often relies for part of its effect upon an  intrinsic interest in the material, so it is usually carried out with  such materials as velvet, satin, or silk, either plain or figured.    The design for this kind of work should be of a bold conventional type,  such as large foliage with the character of the heraldic mantling; any  naturalistic flowers, figures, or animals easily become grotesque. A  simple outline to the forms is necessary, both because of the technical  difficulties and for the effect of the finished work. This kind of work  is hardly suitable for expressing fine detail; oftentimes it is seen  from a distance, and many indentations on an outline sometimes tend to  weaken it. Heraldry can be well expressed by this method. Fig. 95 is an  example from a piece of XIIIth century work, a fragment of the surcoat  of William de Fortibus, third Earl of Albemarle, who lived in the reign  of Henry III.; the example can be seen in the British Museum. This  method of work is also particularly suitable for such purposes as the  decoration of wall surfaces, for hangings of various kinds, or banners;  it can, however, be used for many other purposes, provided the design  and the materials are well chosen.    [Illustration: Fig. 95.]    Owing to the difficulty of working upon some ground stuffs, the method  has arisen of carrying out the embroidery upon an easily worked ground,  such as linen; cutting it out, when finished, along the outline and  applying it to the proper ground, the junction of the two materials  being hidden by a cord or some equivalent. It is usually further  completed by light sprays or some other kind of finishing touches being  placed around the applied part, these worked directly on to the proper  ground. This prevents the embroidery from looking too bald and detached  from its surroundings, of which there is always a danger when it is  carried out separately and then attached; if at all possible it is  always more satisfactory to work directly on to the right ground.    As a matter of fact it is almost always possible to do this; the workers  of the XIIIth century, the period at which the art of embroidery was at  its height, carried out the most exquisitely fine stitching and design  on such grounds as velvet that had almost as long a pile as some  varieties of plush. The famous cope of English work known as the Bowden  cope, of which a detail is given in Plate I., is an excellent  illustration of this point. Upon careful examination of the work it is  apparent that between the stitching and the velvet there is a layer of  material, composed either of fine linen or silk. This would be of great  help in the carrying out of the stitching. It is exceedingly probable  that this layer of fine material was at the commencement of the work  laid completely over the velvet background of the cope; for one thing,  the design, with its finely drawn detail, could easily be perfectly  traced upon a surface of this kind and only imperfectly upon velvet;  another advantage of this method would be, that the background would be  kept quite free from dust and from getting soiled by the hands during  the lengthy process of the work. The stitching would be carried through  all the surfaces, and when finished, the fine surface layer would be cut  away close round the edges of the design, which would be quite easily  done. This method of working upon a difficult ground is well worth  trying in place of the applied method.    To return to the discussion of applied embroidery--let us suppose the  embroidered piece to be just completed on its linen ground, still  stretched in the frame in which it was worked. In another frame, stretch  the background material and trace upon it the exact outline of the piece  to be applied. Cut out the embroidered piece carefully round the edge,  allowing about one-sixteenth of an inch margin outside the worked part,  leaving, if necessary, little connecting ties of material here and  there for temporary support. With fine steel pins or needles fix the  cut-out work exactly over the tracing already made on the ground  material, then make it secure round the edge with rather close stitches  of silk placed at right-angles to the outline; with fine materials the  raw edge of the applied part can be neatly tucked under and fixed in  place by this overcast stitch. A cord is next sewn on to hide the fixing  and give a finish to the edge. The colour of this cord is important,  since its colour may increase the expanse of either the applied part or  the ground. Sometimes a double cord is put round, and in this case the  inner one is attached to the embroidery before it is cut out of the  frame, and the second attached afterwards. The inner one is often of a  colour predominating in the embroidery, and the outer one of the colour  of the ground. Gold cord is very usual; if a coloured silk one is used  it must be a perfect match. The ordinary twisted cord looks best  attached invisibly; to do this, slightly untwist it whilst stitching,  and insert the needle in the opening thus formed. Some kinds of flat  braids look well with the fixing stitches taken deliberately over them  and forming part of the ornamentation (see fig. 91). Bunches of silk are  sometimes couched round with a buttonhole or other stitch, but whatever  the outline may consist of, it should be a firm bold line.    The work must be perfectly flat when completed. Puckering may occur  through want of care in the preliminary straining or in the fixing on of  the applied parts. Some materials are more easy to manage than others.  The difficult ones can if necessary have a preliminary backing applied,  which is useful also if the material is inclined to fray. The backing  may consist of a thin coating of embroidery paste, or of tissue paper or  fine holland pasted over the part to be applied. The more all this kind  of thing can be avoided, the better the work, for pasting of any kind is  apt to give a stiff mechanical look; also, if the work is intended to  hang in folds any stiffness would be most impracticable.    Even more than simpler work applied embroidery needs the finish of some  light work upon the ground. Gold threads and spangles, arranged in  fashion similar to the sprays in fig. 112, are very often used.  Sometimes, instead of this, some small pattern in outline is run all  over the ground in order to enrich it.      INLAID WORK    Inlaid work is in effect similar to the applied, and it is used for the  same purposes. The difference with this is that both background and  pattern are cut out and fitted into each other, instead of only one of  them being cut out and laid on an entire ground. The method of work is  economical, for there need be very little waste of material. What is  left from cutting out the pattern and background for one piece can be  used as ground and pattern for another and possibly companion piece.  There is in Perugia a church which possesses a complete set of draperies  of this description, that were made at a good period for this work,  early XVIth century, and evidently were designed for the position they  occupy. On festivals, the piers, pulpit, and parts of the wall are hung  with these rose and gold-coloured hangings of inlaid work. The design is  a conventional scroll-work pattern, and the various hangings have  alternately the rose ground with gold pattern, and gold ground with rose  pattern, the whole forming a rich and harmonious interchange of colour.    [Illustration: Fig. 96.]    Fig. 96 is an example of inlaid work. It is a XVth century tabard said  to have belonged to Charles the Bold, and now in the Musee Historique at  Berne. The pattern, it will be noticed, is planned on the counterchange  principle, which is particularly well suited for this method of work.    A very ancient piece of the same kind of inlaid work is the funeral tent  of Queen Isi-em-Keb, dated about 980 B.C., which is in the Boulak  Museum, Cairo. It is composed of thousands of"]]]
