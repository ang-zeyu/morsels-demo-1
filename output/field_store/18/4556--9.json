In both cases the  answer is the same--they did it to prevent your giving the alarm,  until they had got far away from the scene. They didn't like to  murder you, because of the consequences to themselves; but they  would not risk your recovering consciousness and getting up an  early pursuit. It cuts both ways, you see.\"    \"So it does,\" Reuben assented. \"It's just a question of belief; and  I own, myself, that that old dog business is very much against me;  and that I can't blame anyone who considers me guilty.\"    Reuben's was the last case taken at the assizes, and occasioned a  good deal of interest in that part of Sussex, partly owing to the  position of Squire Ellison, partly to the nature of the defence set  up, as to which opinion was a good deal divided. The evidence for  the prosecution was, to a great extent, similar to that given at  the inquiry before the magistrates. Unfortunately for Reuben, the  judge was notoriously a severe one; and his bias, from the first,  appeared to be against the prisoner. Mr. Ellison was closely  questioned by the prosecutor as to the poisoning of his dog, as  this was considered to show a particular animus on the part of  Reuben. He again repeated his conviction of Reuben's innocence in  that affair.    \"But what reason have you, Mr. Ellison,\" the counsel for the  prosecution asked blandly, \"for changing your opinion on the  subject?\"    This was just the question which the squire could not answer  satisfactorily; and was a particularly irritating one, because it  had often been triumphantly asked by his wife.    \"I can really give no particular reason,\" he said, \"except that, on  reflection, the boy's previous character and antecedents convinced  me that he could not have done such an act.\"    \"In fact,\" the counsel said suavely, \"you were influenced by your  own goodness of heart, Mr. Ellison, in thus laying aside a  conviction which the facts had, at the time, forced upon you.\"    \"I don't look upon it in that light,\" the squire replied shortly.  \"I consider that in the first instance I acted hastily and  unadvisedly, and on consideration I saw that I had done so.\"    \"I am afraid, Mr. Ellison,\" the counsel said, \"that you will not  persuade the jury to agree with you.\"    \"I have only one or two questions to ask you,\" the counsel for the  defence said, when he rose to cross-examine, \"for indeed your  evidence is, as I think the jury will agree, altogether in favour  of the prisoner. In the first place, was the lad, when in your  employment, ever upstairs in your house?\"    \"Not that I know of,\" the squire replied. \"Certainly in the course  of his duties he would never be there. Indeed, it would be very  seldom that he would even enter the kitchen, except to bring in  vegetables. Certainly he would never pass through to go upstairs.  He could not possibly have done so without exciting attention and  remarks.\"    \"He would therefore, Mr. Ellison, have no means of possessing any  knowledge as to the internal arrangements of your house, beyond  that possessed by the other people in the village?\"    \"None whatever,\" Mr. Ellison replied.    \"Now, as to that unfortunate affair of the poisoning of your dog.  Your opinion, as to the innocence of the prisoner in that matter,  is not a recent one--not the outcome of his after good conduct and  character?\"    \"Not at all,\" Mr. Ellison said. \"I changed my opinion on the matter  very shortly, indeed, after the affair.\"    \"Within a few days, I think I may say?\" the counsel asked.    \"Within a very few days; I may almost say within a few hours,\" the  squire replied. \"The boy's story, told not to me but to another,  that he believed the dog was poisoned by another lad in the village  who owed him a grudge, and who has since turned out an exceedingly  bad character, struck me as being very much more probable than that  he should do it, himself.\"    Mrs. Ellison was next called. Her evidence as to the robbery was a  mere repetition of that given by the squire. The counsel then  turned to the question of the poisoning.    \"I would rather say nothing about it,\" Mrs. Ellison said. \"It is a  matter which has been productive of much pain to me, and I would  rather say nothing about it.\"    \"But you must, madam,\" the judge said sharply. \"You are here to  answer any question which may enable the jury to form an opinion on  this case.\"    \"I am sorry to press you, Mrs. Ellison,\" the counsel continued,  \"but I really must do so. You took a different opinion to that held  by your husband?\"    \"I regret to say that I did. Mr. Ellison told me the reasons he had  for suspecting the boy. I thought those reasons sufficient, and  have seen no cause for changing my opinion.\"    After the evidence for the prosecution had been given, the counsel  for the defence pointed out that there was, in fact, no evidence  whatever connecting Reuben with the robbery, beyond the discovery  of his tools on the premises; and that, as to this trumpery story  of the poisoning a dog, four years before, apparently only for the  purpose of showing some sort of animus, he regarded it as  altogether contemptible. When a man meant to commit a burglary in a  house, he did so in order to obtain possession of the goods, and  not from any spite against the owner. Had this young fellow felt  any malice, for this ridiculous charge on which he had been  dismissed, he would not have allied himself with burglars to rob  the house; but would probably have vented his spite in the usual  fashion, by setting fire to a stack or outhouse; but so far as he  could see, there was no foundation for the charge brought against  him, and they had already heard Mr. Ellison declare that he  regretted he had suspected him, and that he believed him to be  innocent.    But even had it been proved, up to the hilt, that the prisoner had  poisoned the dog, he should still hold it as wholly unconnected  with the present matter. If he had poisoned the dog, what then? It  was not a heinous sin, nor would it affect his moral character. No  boy likes having a piece taken out of his calf by a savage dog, and  there would have been nothing so very dreadful had he revenged  himself. It was probable that, even among the jury, there was one  or more who, if he had not absolutely set poison for his  neighbour's cats, for destroying his young chickens or scratching  up his flower beds, had threatened to do so, and would not have  regarded it as a very serious crime had he done so.    Therefore he contended that the jury should put this trumpery  affair altogether out of their minds; on the double ground that, in  the first place, the prisoner at the bar did not poison the dog;  and that, had he done so, it would have had nothing whatever to do  with the present affair.    \"Why, gentlemen,\" he said, \"it is an insult to your understanding  to ask you to credit that this young fellow--whose character, which  I shall presently prove to you, by unimpeachable evidence, is of  the highest kind--has, for four years, cherished such malice  against his employer, for dismissing him mistakenly, that he has  become the consort of thieves and burglars, has stained his hands  in crime, and rendered himself liable to transportation, for the  purpose merely of spiting that gentleman. Such a contention would  be absolutely absurd. I must beg you to dismiss it altogether from  your mind, and approach it from a different standpoint, altogether.  Divested of this extraneous business, the matter is a most simple  one.    \"The prisoner left his mother's cottage, at seven o'clock in the  evening, to go over for an hour or two to his friend Mr.  Shrewsbury, the schoolmaster of Tipping. He took with him a few  tools, as he had promised to put some shelves in his friend's  house. On the way he heard some talking down a lane, which he knew  led to only a field. Thinking it strange, he went to see who it was  and, some distance down, he found a horse and cart standing and,  listening to the conversation of two men who were sitting under the  hedge, he heard enough to inform him that a burglary was intended  upon the house of Mr. Ellison. He was about to make off to give the  alarm, when he was suddenly attacked by some men who had come up  behind, and was felled to the ground. While lying insensible, he  was bound hand and foot and left in a ditch; where he remained till  the burglars returned from completing the work on hand. They then  threw him into the cart, and put him down some twenty miles away.  Being greatly exhausted by loss of blood, it was late in the  afternoon before he arrived at Lewes, when he was at once arrested.    \"This, gentlemen, is the prisoner's story, as related to the chief  constable when he was taken to the lockup. Nothing can be simpler  or more probable; and in some points, at least, I shall be able to  confirm it by independent testimony. Mr. Shrewsbury will tell you  that the prisoner had arranged to come over to see him, and bring  his tools. He will also tell you that, two days after the  prisoner's arrest, he went with Jones, the village constable, and  found the marks where the horse and trap had stood; while, just  inside the field, the grass was trampled with feet; and in the  bottom of the dry ditch was a great dark patch, which he was able  to ascertain to be blood. Doctor Hewitt will tell you that he was  called in to strap up the prisoner's head, after his arrest; and  that the cut was a very severe one, and must have been inflicted by  a heavy weapon, with great force.    \"I am convinced, gentlemen, that after hearing this evidence you  will agree with me, not only that the prisoner"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#12)"],[1,"is a death  impending in the family. The last time he was heard was shortly before  the death of the last Countess (the Earl's former wife); and that is  why Lord Airlie became so pale when you mentioned it. The drummer boy  is a very unpleasant subject in this family, I assure you.'    \"Miss D. was naturally much concerned, and indeed not a little  frightened at this explanation, and her alarm being augmented by  hearing the sounds on the following day, she took her departure from  Cortachy Castle, and returned to Lord C.'s, where she related this  strange circumstance to the family, through whom the information  reached me.    \"This affair was very generally known in the north, and we awaited the  event with interest. The melancholy death of the Countess about five  or six months afterwards, at Brighton, sadly verified the  prognostications. I have heard that a paper was found in her desk  after her death, declaring her conviction that the drum was for her.\"    Mrs. Crowe goes on to explain the origin of the phenomenon. According  to legend, she says, there was once at Cortachy a drummer, who,  incurring the jealousy of the then Lord Airlie, was thrust into his  own drum and flung from a window of the tower (in which, by the way,  Miss D. slept). Before being put to death thus, the drummer is stated  to have said he would for ever after haunt the Airlie family--a threat  he has obviously been permitted to fulfil.    During one of my visits to Scotland, I stayed some days in Forfarshire  not far from Cortachy. Among the visitors at my hotel was a very old  gentleman of the name of Porter, who informed me that, when a boy, he  used to visit some relatives who, at that time, lived within easy  walking distance of Cortachy. One of these relatives was a lad of  about fourteen, named Alec, with whom he had always been the closest  of friends. The recollection of their many adventures evidently  afforded Mr. Porter infinite amusement, and one of these adventures,  in particular, he told me, was as fresh in his mind as if it had  happened yesterday.    \"Looking back upon it now,\" he said, with a far-away look in his eyes,  \"it certainly was a strange coincidence, and if you are interested in  the hauntings of Cortachy, Mr. O'Donnell, you may, perhaps, like to  hear the account of my ghostly experiences in that neighbourhood.\"    Of course I replied that nothing would give me greater pleasure, and  Mr. Porter forthwith began his story.    \"One misty night in October, my friend Alec and I, both being keen on  rabbiting, determined to visit a spinney adjoining the Cortachy  estate, in pursuit of our quarry. Alec had chosen this particular  night, thinking, under cover of the mist, to escape the vigilance of  the keepers, who had more than once threatened to take him before the  laird for trespassing.    \"To gain access to the spinney we had to climb a granite wall and drop  on the other side--the drop, in addition to being steep, being  rendered all the more precarious by reason of the man-traps the  keepers were in the habit of setting. When I got astride the wall and  peered into the well-like darkness at our feet, and heard the grim  rustling of the wind through the giant pines ahead of me, I would have  given all I possessed to have found myself snug and warm in bed; but  Alec was of a different 'kidney'--he had come prepared for excitement,  and he meant to have it. For some seconds, we both waited on the wall  in breathless silence, and then Alec, with a reckless disregard of  what might be in store for him, gently let himself drop, and I,  fearing more, if anything, than the present danger, to be for ever  after branded as a coward if I held back, timidly followed suit. By a  great stroke of luck we alighted in safety on a soft carpeting of  moss. Not a word was spoken, but, falling on hands and knees, and  guiding ourselves by means of a dark lantern Alec had bought  second-hand from the village blacksmith, we crept on all-fours along a  tiny bramble-covered path, that after innumerable windings eventually  brought us into a broad glade shut in on all sides by lofty trees.  Alec prospected the spot first of all to see no keepers were about,  and we then crawled into it, and, approaching the nearest burrows, set  to work at once with our ferrets. Three rabbits were captured in this  fashion, and we were eagerly anticipating the taking of more, when a  sensation of icy coldness suddenly stole over us, and, on looking  round, we perceived, to our utmost consternation, a very tall keeper  standing only a few yards away from us. For once in a way, Alec was  nonplussed, and a deathly silence ensued. It was too dark for us to  see the figure of the keeper very distinctly, and we could only  distinguish a gleaming white face set on a very slight and  perpendicular frame, and a round, glittering something that puzzled us  both exceedingly. Then, a feeling that, perhaps, it was not a keeper  gradually stole over me, and in a paroxysm of ungovernable terror I  caught hold of Alec, who was trembling from head to foot as if he had  the ague. The figure remained absolutely still for about a minute,  during which time neither Alec nor I could move a muscle, and then,  turning round with an abrupt movement, came towards us.    \"Half-dead with fright, but only too thankful to find that we had now  regained the use of our limbs, we left our spoil and ran for our lives  in the direction of the wall.    \"We dared not look back, but we knew the figure followed us, for we  heard its footsteps close at our heels; and never to my dying day  shall I forget the sound--rat-tat, tat, rat-tat, tat--for all the  world like the beat of a muffled drum.    \"How we ever managed to reach the wall I could never tell, but as we  scrambled over it, regardless of man-traps and bruises, and plunged  into the heather on the other side, we heard the weird footsteps  receding in the direction of the castle, and, ere we had reached home,  the rat-tat, tat, rat-tat, tat, had completely died away.    \"We told no one a word of what had happened, and a few days after,  simultaneously with the death of one of the Airlies, we learned, for  the first time, the story of the Phantom Drummer.    \"I have little doubt,\" Mr. Porter added, in conclusion, \"that the  figure we took to be a keeper was the prophetic Drummer, for I can  assure you there was no possibility of hoaxers, especially in such  ill-omened guise, anywhere near the Cortachy estate.\"    Poor old Mr. Porter! He did not long survive our _rencontre_. When I  next visited the hotel, some months later, I was genuinely grieved to  hear of his decease. His story had greatly fascinated me, for I love  the solitude of the pines, and have myself from time to time witnessed  many remarkable occult phenomena under the shadow of their lofty  summits. One night, during this second visit of mine to the hotel, the  mood to ramble came upon me, and, unable to resist the seductive  thought of a midnight stroll across the bracken-covered hills, I  borrowed a latchkey, and, armed with a flask of whisky and a thick  stick, plunged into the moonlit night. The keen, heather-scented air  acted like a tonic--I felt younger and stronger than I had felt for  years, and I congratulated myself that my friends would hardly know me  if they saw me now, as I swung along with the resuscitated stride of  twenty years ago. The landscape for miles around stood out with  startling clearness in the moonshine, and I stopped every now and then  to drink in the beauties of the glittering mountain-ranges and silent,  glimmering tarns. Not a soul was about, and I found myself, as I loved  to be, the only human element in the midst of nature. Every now and  then a dark patch fluttered across the shining road, and with a weird  and plaintive cry, a night bird dashed abruptly from hedge to hedge,  and seemingly melted into nothingness. I quitted the main road on the  brow of a low hill, and embarked upon a wild expanse of moor, lavishly  covered with bracken and white heather, intermingled with which were  the silvery surfaces of many a pool of water. For some seconds I stood  still, lost in contemplating the scenery,--its utter abandonment and  grand sense of isolation; and inhaling at the same time long and deep  draughts of the delicious moorland air, unmistakably impregnated now  with breaths of ozone. My eyes wandering to the horizon, I detected,  on the very margin of the moorland, a dense clump of trees, which I  instantly associated with the spinney in my old friend Mr. Porter's  story, and, determining that the renowned spinney should be my goal, I  at once aimed for it, vigorously striking out along the path which I  thought would be most likely to lead to it. Half an hour's brisk  walking brought me to my destination, and I found myself standing  opposite a granite wall which my imagination had no difficulty in  identifying with the wall so well described by Mr. Porter. Removing  the briars and gorse prickles which left little of my stockings whole,  I went up to the wall, and, measuring it with my body, found it was a  good foot taller than I. This would mean rather more climbing than I  had bargained for. But the pines--the grim silence of their slender  frames and gently swaying summits--fascinated me. They spoke of  possibilities few could see or appreciate as I could; possibilities of  a sylvan phantasmagoria enhanced by the soft and mystic radiance of  the moon. An owl hooted, and the rustling of brushwood told me of the  near proximity of some fur-coated burrower in the ground. High above  this animal life, remoter even than the tops of my beloved trees or  the mountain-ranges, etched on the dark firmament, shone multitudinous  stars, even the rings round Saturn being plainly discernible. From the  Milky Way my eyes at length wandered to the pines, and a puff of air  laden with the odour of their resin and decaying"]]]
