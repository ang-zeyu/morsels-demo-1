He was thus  employed when the parliament met on the 19th of January, 1764. This was  the day fixed for his appearance, but the speaker produced a letter from  him, enclosing a certificate signed by a French physician and a French  surgeon, testifying that he could not quit Paris without danger to his  life. This certificate wanted the signature of a notary public to give  it authenticity, and the house, therefore, resolved to proceed against  Wilkes as though he were present. Witnesses and papers were examined,  and it was resolved, that No. 45 of the \"North Briton,\" which had been  voted a seditious libel, contained expressions of unexampled insolence  and contumely toward his majesty, the grossest aspersions upon both  houses of parliament, and the most audacious defiance of the whole  legislative authority. It was also denounced as having a manifest  tendency to alienate the affections of the people from their king,  to withdraw them from obedience to the laws, and to excite them to  insurrection. On the next day it was further resolved, that Wilkes  should be expelled the house, and a new writ was issued for the borough  of Aylesbury; a measure which ultimately had the effect of rendering him  a popular champion in the struggle between the house of commons and the  electors of Middlesex, which defined the power of the representative  body in relation to its constituency. Even now it greatly increased  the popularity of Wilkes among the great body of the people. On every  opportune occasion they loudly expressed their sentiments in his favour.  The king and his ministers were compelled to hear whenever they  appeared in public the grating and unwelcome exclamation of, \"Wilkes and  liberty!\"    Although ministers had triumphed over Wilkes personally, by obtaining  his expulsion from the house, yet they were doomed to suffer a check  from a motion naturally arising out of his prosecution. On the 13th  of February, it was moved by the opposition, that Wilkes' complaint of  breach of privilege should be heard. On this subject they obtained a  large majority; his complaint being thrown out, after a stormy debate  which lasted three days and one whole night. This, however, was followed  by a resolution moved by Sir William Meredith, in which they were not  so successful, namely, \"That a general warrant for apprehending and  securing the authors, printers, and publishers of a seditious libel,  together with their papers, is not warranted by law.\" An adjournment was  proposed, but Pitt and others made speeches upon the subject, and when  the house divided, ministers had only the small majority of fourteen  upon the question of adjournment. This was virtually a defeat, and the  illegality of general warrants was so effectually established by the  numbers who voted on the side of the opposition, and by the sentiments  of the orators, that henceforth the use of them was wholly discontinued.  If, therefore, this prosecution of Wilkes was impolitic, it had at least  the effect of settling a great constitutional principle; nor was it long  before the measures taken against him effected other alterations in the  constitution equally important.    Wilkes having entered an appearance in Westminster Hall, was at length  tried and convicted on two indictments, for publishing the 45th Number  of the North Briton, and the \"Essay on Woman.\" He was afterwards  outlawed for not appearing in court to receive his sentence, whence  the suit he had instituted against Lord Halifax fell to the ground.  The cause of Wilkes, however, being identified with that of the  constitution, his popularity remained undiminished, and the spirit  excited by the proceedings against him was still as rife with bitterness  as ever.          PROPOSITION TO TAX THE AMERICAN COLONIES.    It was at this troubled season that George Grenville brought forward a  motion for extracting a direct revenue from the colonies. The idea was  not altogether new, for such a scheme had been hinted at during Sir  Robert Walpole's administration. At this time it seems to have been  revived, by the general complaint heard among the people of England, of  the burden of taxation which they were called upon to bear. His majesty  proposed such a step, as a just, as well as advantageous measure for  relieving the country from the financial difficulties which had been  occasioned by a war undertaken for the protection and security of the  colonies themselves. Accordingly, a series of resolutions, respecting  new duties to be laid on goods imported by the Americans, was brought  into the House by Grenville on the 10th of March. These resolutions  passed with little notice; General Conway, it is said, being the only  member who protested against them; and they received the royal assent on  the 5th of April. The minister, also, proposed raising a direct revenue  from the colonies in the shape of a stamp-tax, but this was objected  to by the opposition, and it was postponed to another session. Certain  restrictions, however, were at the same time laid upon the profitable  contraband trade carried on by the Americans with the Spanish colonies;  a trade alike advantageous to England and the North American colonists,  but of which the Spanish government was constantly and bitterly  complaining to the court of Great Britain.          OPPOSITION OF THE AMERICANS.    It seems probable that ministers undertook this scheme of taxation, in  order to gain popularity. It had that effect in some slight degree. The  country gentlemen, in particular, were well pleased with the prospect of  the non-increase on the diminution of the land-tax, and other sections  of the community hoped eventually to have their burdens lightened by  such a measure. In proroguing parliament the king expressed his hearty  approbation of it, auguring the augmentation of the public revenues, a  unity of the interests of his most distant possessions, and an increase  of commerce, as its natural results. Like the Greek fisherman in  Theocritus, all dreamed of gold; but in the course of a few months this  pleasant dream was swept away by a strong wind across the Atlantic.    The inhabitants of New England received these \"wise regulations\" of the  British parliament \"like knives put to their throats.\" Perceiving that  the claim made by their mother-country to tax the colonies for her own  benefit, and at her own discretion, might possibly introduce a system of  oppression, they boldly denied the authority of parliament to levy any  direct tax on the colonies, and declared that it was a violation of  their rights as colonists, possessing by charter the privilege of taxing  themselves for their own support; and as British subjects, who ought not  to be taxed without their legitimate representatives. The disaffection  of the northern provinces extended to those of the south, and, as a  strong measure of resistance, all engaged to abstain from the use of  those luxuries which had hitherto been imported from Great Britain. They  also made colonial taxation a subject of their petitions to king, lords,  and commons, and thus firmly established the principle of resistance to  such a measure. Their resistance was confirmed by an unwise measure of  Grenville, who determined to intrust the execution of his prohibitory  orders to military and naval officers, who were disposed to act with  rigour. Government, also, had increased the salaries of judges, which  gave rise to an opinion that it was desirous of diminishing their  independence; and the governors had recently acted very arbitrarily, and  when complaints were made no attention was paid to them, or if a reply  was given, it was accompanied with rebuke. The colonists, moreover, were  encouraged in their spirit of resistance by the emigration of numbers  who had lately left England, and who being disaffected persons, diffused  republican sentiments in all the provinces. The seeds of discontent  were, in fact, sown far and wide before this new system of taxation  was projected, and it had the effect of causing them to germinate and  flourish.          WAR WITH THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS.    It unfortunately happened, that the news of colonial taxation arrived in  America when the colonists were in no very pleasant humour. On quitting  Canada, the French government still retained some slight connexion with  the native Indians, and partly by their agents, and in part through  encroachments made by the British on their hunting-grounds, they  were incited to war. The tribes flew to arms, designing to make a  simultaneous attack on all the English back-settlements in harvest-time,  and though their secret was made known, and their intentions prevented  in some places, yet the frontiers of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and  Virginia were mercilessly ravaged by them, and the inhabitants in those  parts utterly destroyed. The Indians also captured several forts in  Canada, and massacred the garrisons; and their flying parties frequently  intercepted and butchered the troops that were marching from place to  place, and plundered and murdered the traders in the upper part of the  country. Success made them more bold, and it seems probable, from the  display of courage and of military talent which they manifested, that  French officers were among them. They even resolved to advance on the  principal force stationed at Fort Pitt, and they marched forward in full  confidence of victory. In their route they defeated a detachment under  Captain Dalzel, and killed that unfortunate officer, and the soldiers  escaped with difficulty into Fort Detroit. Fort Pitt was now surrounded  by them, but they soon abandoned it, in order to attack Colonel Bouquet,  who was advancing with a strong corps under his command for its relief.  Fearful struggles took place between Colonel Bouquet and the Indians,  in which a great number was killed on both sides, but they were finally  routed, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19226"],[0,"The Dog's Book of Verse (#12)"],[1,"in shadows dark:      But oftener hailed with joyous cry      Some friendly face returning home,      Or, wild with glee, the fields to roam--    Now still and cold thou here dost lie!

CANINE IMMORTALITY        And they have drowned thee then at last! poor Phillis!    The burden of old age was heavy on thee,    And yet thou shouldst have lived! What though thine eye    Was dim, and watched no more with eager joy    The wonted call that on thy dull sense sunk    With fruitless repetition, the warm sun    Might still have cheered thy slumber; thou didst love    To lick the hand that fed thee, and though past    Youth's active season, even life itself    Was comfort. Poor old friend! How earnestly    Would I have pleaded for thee! thou hadst been    Still the companion of my childish sports:    And as I roamed o'er Avon's woody cliffs,    From many a day-dream has thy short quick bark    Recalled my wandering soul. I have beguiled    Often the melancholy hours at school,    Soured by some little tyrant, with the thought    Of distant home, and I remembered then    Thy faithful fondness: for not mean the joy,    Returning at the pleasant holidays,    I felt from thy dumb welcome. Pensively    Sometimes have I remarked the slow decay,    Feeling myself changed, too, and musing much,    On many a sad vicissitude of life!    Ah, poor companion! when thou followedst last    Thy master's parting footsteps to the gate    Which closed forever on him, thou didst lose    Thy truest friend, and none was left to plead    For the old age of brute fidelity!    But fare thee well! Mine is no narrow creed;    And He who gave thee being did not frame    The mystery of life to be the sport    Of merciless man!
