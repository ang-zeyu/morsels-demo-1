You see it says you will give us more information. Of  course, both Fred and I are curious to know all the particulars.\"    \"I'll be glad to tell you all I can, boys,\" answered Colonel Colby.  \"And first of all let me say that I have also volunteered, and I, too,  have been commissioned.\"    \"Isn't that fine!\" exclaimed Fred. \"Are you going with our fathers?\"    \"Yes. And I may as well tell you a little secret. Quite a crowd of us,  all former pupils of Putnam Hall, have volunteered, and we hope to go  into the war together.\"    \"May I ask what sort of commission my father obtained?\" questioned  Jack.    \"He has been made a captain and your Uncle Sam has been made a  lieutenant.\"    \"A lieutenant!\" said Fred. \"Well, that's something anyhow!\"    \"And what about you, if I may ask?\" continued Jack.    \"I, too, have been made a captain.\"    \"Who of the others of the Old Guard are going?\" asked Fred.    \"Oh, there are quite a number, including Harry Blossom, Bart Conners,  Dave Kearney, and Hans Mueller.\"    \"For gracious sake! you don't mean that Hans Mueller is going?\"  queried Jack. He had often heard of this German-American who had been  a school chum of his father. Mueller had never learned to use the  English language correctly, and had been intensely German in many of  his ways.    \"Yes, Hans Mueller has volunteered,\" answered Colonel Colby. \"But he  is going into the heavy artillery, so I'm afraid your fathers and I  won't see very much of him. In spite of his German blood, Hans Mueller  is very patriotic, and that counts for a good deal.\"    \"I should say it did!\" said Fred.    \"And what about Mr. Powell and Mr. Garrison?\" questioned Jack.    \"We have been corresponding with those two gentlemen, but up to to-day  have not heard what they have decided to do. We are hoping that they  will go with us if they can leave their business. And that puts me in  mind. You will probably want to know about your Uncle Tom, and I  presume the twins would like to know, too.\"    \"Yes, indeed!\"    \"Well, when the question of going to the front came up, your Uncle Tom  was just as eager to go as anybody, even though he was never an  officer during his days at Putnam Hall Military Academy. But it was  realized that some one must remain behind to take charge of The Rover  Company. More than this, your Uncle Tom is at the head of one of the  most important committees connected with the sale of Liberty Bonds,  and he is also at the head of one of the Red Cross committees, and  doing splendid work in both positions. The matter was talked over a  number of times, and finally, much, however, against his will, he  consented to withdraw in favor of your fathers. It is understood that  he is not only to look after the business, but that he will likewise  look after all of you young folks, including your sisters.\"    \"And how soon do all of you expect to leave, if I may ask?\" questioned  Jack.    \"That will depend somewhat on circumstances. As soon as I receive any  word, I'll let you know. In the meanwhile, however, you may get some  word from home.\"    The two cadets continued to talk the matter over with Colonel Colby  for several minutes longer, and then, realizing that he was a very  busy man, they withdrew and hurried back to their own rooms.    \"Now tell us all about it,\" said Andy. All of the outsiders except  Spouter and Gif had gone to their own quarters.    \"Tell it straight,\" said Randy.    Sitting down, Jack and Fred did so, the others listening closely to  every word that was said. As they proceeded the twins showed their  satisfaction over the news.    \"I knew dad would want to go just as much as anybody,\" declared Randy.    \"So did I,\" added his twin. \"As it is, I guess he'll have as much to  do as anybody.\"    \"He'll certainly have his hands full, running The Rover Company and  being on those two committees, as well as looking after all of us  young folks.\"    \"Just as if we couldn't look after ourselves!\" exclaimed Fred.    \"Oh, well, you know what I mean!\"    \"This gets me!\" said Spouter. \"I'd like to know what my father is  going to do. If he is going into the army, I'd like to know it.\"    \"And I'd like to know what my father is going to do, too,\" said Gif.  \"I don't believe he cares much for military matters, but just the  same, he is intensely patriotic, and I know he would like to get a  chance at those Boches.\"    \"I suppose we'll get more news in a day or two,\" said Jack. \"This  telegram was sent more to break the ice than anything else. It puts it  up to us to let Mary and Martha know,\" and he looked at Fred as he  spoke.    \"We'll go over to-morrow and see them,\" was Fred's reply. \"I don't  think I care to telephone news like this. No, we'll take them off by  themselves and let them know.\"    A little later Spouter and Gif retired. The four Rover boys sat up for  fully an hour longer, discussing the subject from every possible point  of view. To Jack and Fred the entrance of their fathers into the army  of the United States meant a great deal. The great war was on in all  its fury, and they knew that sooner or later their fathers would be  sent to France to face the enemy.    \"It's all well enough to talk about going to the front and covering  oneself with glory,\" was the way Fred expressed himself. \"But some of  those who go to the front never come back.\"    \"That is true, Fred,\" answered Jack soberly. \"But a good citizen has  got to be ready to do his duty, no matter what the cost.\"    \"Oh, I know that! Just the same, this going to the front is a serious  business. Even if a person isn't killed, he may come back minus an arm  or a leg, or something like that.\"    \"Well, don't you go to talking like that to Mary and Martha.\"    \"I don't intend to. Just the same, what I said is true.\"    \"I know it.\"          CHAPTER X    ON THE WAY HOME      \"Oh, Jack, you don't mean it! Father and Uncle Sam have really  volunteered for the war!\"    It was Martha Rover who spoke. She and her brother were seated in a  small summerhouse attached to Clearwater Hall. Not far away sat Mary  and Fred.    \"It's the truth, Martha,\" answered Jack; \"and here is the telegram  that was sent. We at once went to Colonel Colby and got some  particulars.\"    \"But he may be shot down and killed!\" and Martha's face grew white as  she spoke.    \"That's a chance every soldier takes when he goes to the front,  Martha. But let us hope that dad will escape--and let us hope that  Uncle Sam will escape, too.\"    Jack and Fred had come over early in the morning and had asked  permission of Miss Garwood to see the girls on an important errand.  They had left the school building under the curious eyes of Ruth and a  number of their other chums.    \"Well, in one way, I'm glad of this,\" declared Mary, her pride showing  in her face. \"It's exactly what I thought dad would do the minute we  got into the war. I knew he wouldn't want to be thought a slacker.\"    \"But, Mary! suppose they got killed--or even wounded?\" murmured  Martha.    \"Martha Rover! do you want your father to hang back when he thinks  it's his duty to go to the front?\" demanded Mary, her eyes snapping  questioningly.    \"No, no!\" answered her cousin quickly. \"I know it's the right thing to  do. Just the same, it worries me a great deal; and I know it will  worry mamma, too.\"    \"You mustn't say anything about being a slacker,\" admonished Jack. \"If  it should get to the ears of Uncle Tom, it might make him feel very  bad.\"    \"Oh, I don't put Uncle Tom down as a slacker,\" returned Mary quickly.  \"I think he is making a great sacrifice, by staying behind to keep the  business together, and to serve on that Loan Committee and the Red  Cross Committee.\"    The young folks talked it over for some time, and decided to wait  until they got further word from home. Then the two girls went back  into the school to tell Miss Garwood and their chums the news, while  the boys hurried to Colby Hall, arriving there during the morning  recess.    \"Say, but we've had some fun since you went away!\" cried Andy gaily,  when they appeared. \"Pud Hicks, the janitor's assistant, got the  surprise of his life.\"    \"How is that?\" questioned Fred.    \"Why, Pud was using a vacuum cleaner in the upper hall when he saw  something in a dark corner that he couldn't quite make out. The thing  got stuck in the cleaner, and he put down his hand to see what it was.  The next minute he let out a yell like a wild Indian and came flying  down the corridor, scared stiff.\"    \"What was it--the snapping turtle?\" asked Jack.    \"You've struck it. The turtle must have crawled into the corner, and  when he felt Pud's hand on him he took a good solid hold on Pud's  little finger.    \"I had just gone upstairs to get a book when I saw Pud tearing around.  Half a dozen fellows were there, and the way Pud cut up was like a  circus. Shout Plunger came tearing upstairs to find out what it was  all about, and Pud gave the snapping turtle a sling, and it hit Shout  right in the face and then fell down inside his coat. Shout put his  hand inside to find out what it was, he being too deaf to hear the  talk about a snapping turtle, and then the turtle got busy and got  Shout by the hand. Then there was more fun!\"    \"What did they do with the turtle at last?\" questioned Jack.    \"Oh, Shout wouldn't take any chances,\" answered Andy. \"He put the  turtle down on the floor and smashed it with his heel; and then, of  course, the fun was all over.\"    \"Did they find out how the turtle came to be there?\" questioned Fred.    \"No, they didn't. Codfish came along, and he started to say something,  but I put up my fist and motioned to him, and then he shut up like a  clam.\"    \"He'll give you away sooner or later, Andy,\" remarked Jack.    \"If he does, he'll pay for it,\" retorted the fun-loving Rover.    Several days went by, and during that time the boys learned not a  little concerning the catastrophe at the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23319"],[0,"Mechanical Drawing Self-Taught (#12)"],[1,". The lines are then inked in, the pencil  lines rubbed out, and the drawing will appear as in Figure 130.    [Illustration: Fig. 131.]    [Illustration: Fig. 132.]    Suppose, however, that the piece has a step in it, as in Figure 132, and  the pencilling will be as in Figure 133. From the centre, the arcs 1, 2,  3 and 4 for the outer, and arcs 5, 6, 7 and 8 for the inner square are  marked; lines 9 and 10, and their prolongations, 11 and 12, for the  edge view, are then pencilled; lines 13 and 14, and their prolongations,  15 and 16, are then pencilled, and dots to show the locations for lines  21 and 22 maybe marked and the pencilling is complete. Lines 17, 18, 19,  20, 21, 22, and 23 may then be inked in, in the order named, and then  lines 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, when the inking in will be  complete.    [Illustration: Fig. 133.]    In inking in horizontal lines begin at the top and mark in each line as  the square comes to it; and in inking the vertical ones begin always at  the left hand line and mark the lines as they are come to, moving the  square or the triangle to the right, and great care should be taken not  to let the lines cross where they meet, as at the corners, since this  would greatly impair the appearance of the drawing.    These figures have been drawn without the aid of a centre line, because  from their shapes it was easy to dispense with it, but in most cases a  centre line is necessary; thus in Figure 134 we have a body having a  number of steps. The diameters of these steps are marked by arcs, as in  the previous examples, and their lengths may be marked by applying the  measuring rule direct to the drawing paper and making the necessary  pencil mark.    But it would be tedious to mark the successive steps true one with the  other by measuring each step, because one step would require to be  pencilled in before the next could be marked. To avoid this the centre  line 1, Figure 134, is first marked, and the arcs for the steps are then  marked as shown. Centre lines are also necessary to show the alignment  of one part to another; thus in Figure 135 is a cube with a hole passing  through it. The dotted lines in the side view show that the hole passes  clear through the piece and is a parallel one, while the centre line,  being central to the outline throughout the piece, shows that the hole  is equidistant, all through, from the walls of the piece.    [Illustration: Fig. 134.]    [Illustration: Fig. 135.]    The pencil lines for this piece would be marked as in Figure 136, line 1  representing the centre line from which all the arcs are marked. It will  be noted that the length of the piece is marked by arcs which occur,  because being a cube the set of the compasses for arcs 2, 3, 4 and 5  will answer without altering to mark arcs 6 and 7.    [Illustration: Fig. 136.]    If the hole in the piece were a taper or conical one, it would be  denoted by the dotted lines, as in Figure 137, and that the taper is  central to the body is shown by these dotted lines being equidistant  from the centre line.    [Illustration: Fig. 137.]    Suppose one of the sides to be tapered, as is the side A, in Figure 138,  and that the hole is not central, and both facts will be shown by the  centre lines 1 and 2 in the figure. The measurement of face A would be  marked from A to line B at each end, but the distance the hole was out  of the centre would be marked by the distance between the centre line 2  and the edge C of the piece.    [Illustration: Fig. 138.]    If the hole did not pass entirely through the piece, the dotted lines  would show it, as in Figure 139.    [Illustration: Fig. 139.]    [Illustration: Fig. 140.]    The designations of the views of a piece of work depend upon the  position in which the piece stands, when in place upon the machine of  which it forms a part. Thus in Figure 140 is a lever, and if its shaft  stood horizontal when the piece is in place in the machine, the view  given is an end one, but suppose that the shaft stood vertical, and the  same view becomes a plan or top view.    [Illustration: Fig. 141.]    [Illustration: Fig. 142.]    In Figure 142 is a view of a lever which is a side view if the lever  stands horizontal, and lever B hangs down, or a plan view if the shaft  stands horizontal, but lever B stands also horizontal. We may take the  same drawing and turn it around on the paper as in Figure 143, and it  becomes a side view if the shaft stands vertical, and a plan view if the  shaft stands horizontal and arm D vertical above it.    In a side or an end view, the piece that projects highest in the drawing  is highest when upon the machine; also in a side elevation the piece  that is at the highest point in the drawing extends farthest upward when  the piece is on the machine. But in a plan or top view the height of  vertical pieces is not shown, as appears in the case of arm D in Figure  143.    [Illustration: Fig. 143.]    In either of the levers, Figures 142 or 143, all the dimensions could be  marked if an additional view were given, but this will not be the case  if an eye have a slot in it, as at E, in Figure 144, or a jaw have a  tongue in it, as at F: hence, end views of the eye and the jaw must be  given, which may be most conveniently done by showing them projected  from the ends of those parts as in the figure.    This naturally brings us to a consideration as to the best method of  projecting one view from another. As a general rule, the side elevation  or side view is the most important, because it shows more of the parts  and details of the work; hence it should be drawn first, because it  affords more assistance in drawing the other views.    [Illustration: Fig. 144.]    There are two systems of placing the different views of a piece. In the  first the views are presented as the piece would present itself if it  were laid upon the paper for the side view, and then turned or rolled  upon the paper for the other views, as shown in Figure 145, in which the  piece consists of five sections or members, marked respectively A, B, C,  D, and E. Now if the piece were turned or rolled so that the end face of  B were uppermost, and the member E was beneath, it will, by the  operation of turning it, have assumed the position in the lower view  marked position 2; while if it were turned over upon the paper in the  opposite direction it would assume the position marked 3. This gives to  the mind a clear idea of the various views and positions; but it  possesses some disadvantages: thus, if position 1 is a side elevation or  view of the piece, as it stands when in place of the machine, then E is  naturally the bottom member; but it is shown in the top view of the  drawing, hence what is actually the bottom view of the piece (position  3) becomes the top view in the drawing. A second disadvantage is that if  we desire to put in dotted lines, to show how one view is derived from  the other, and denote corresponding parts, then these dotted lines must  be drawn across the face of the drawing, making it less distinct; thus  the dotted lines connecting stem E in position 1 to E in position 3,  pass across the faces of both A and B of position 1.    [Illustration: Fig. 145.]    [Illustration: Fig. 146.]    In a large drawing, or one composed of many members or parts, it would,  therefore, be out of the question to mark in the dotted lines. A  further disadvantage in a large drawing is that it is necessary to go  from one side of the drawing to the other to see the construction of the  same part.    [Illustration: Fig. 147.]    To obviate these difficulties, a modern method is to suppose the piece,  instead of rolling upon the paper, to be lifted from it, turned around  to present the required view, and then moved upwards on the paper for a  top view, sideways for a side view, and below for a bottom view. Thus  the three views of the piece in Figure 145 would be as in Figure 146,  where position 2 is obtained by supposing the piece to be lifted from  position 1, the bottom face turned uppermost, and the piece moved down  the paper to position 2, which is a bottom view of the piece, and the  bottom view in the drawing. Similarly, if the piece be lifted from  position 1, and the top face in that figure is turned uppermost, and the  piece is then slid upwards on the paper, view 3 is obtained, being a top  view of the piece as it lies in position 1, and the top view in the  drawing. Now suppose we require to find the shape of member B, then in  Figure 145 we require to look at the top of position 1, and then down  below to position 2.    [Illustration: Fig. 148.]    But in Figure 146 we have the side view and end view both together,  while the dotted lines do not require to cross the face of the side  view. Now suppose we take a similar piece, and suppose its end faces,  as F, G, to have holes in them, which require to be shown in both views,  and under the one system the drawing would, if the dotted lines were  drawn across, appear as in Figure 147, whereas under the other system  the drawing would appear as in Figure 148. And it follows that in cases  where it is necessary to draw dotted lines from one view to the other,  it is best to adopt the new system.          CHAPTER VII.    _EXAMPLES IN BOLTS, NUTS, AND POLYGONS._      [Illustration: Fig. 149.]    [Illustration: Fig. 150.]    [Illustration: Fig. 151.]    Let it be required to draw a machine screw, and it is not necessary, and  therefore not usual in small screws to draw the full outline of the  thread, but to represent it by thick and thin lines running diagonally  across the bolt, as in Figure 149, the thick ones representing the  bottom, and the thin ones the top of the thread. The pencil lines would  be drawn in the order shown in Figure 150. Line 1 is the centre line,  and line 2 a line to represent the lower side of the head; from the  intersection of these two lines as a centre (as at A) short arcs 3 "]]]
