It is better to strengthen it and to favor the  elimination of the substance that is irritating it. The increased blood  pressure throughout the body may be diminished by lessening the quantity  of blood. This is obtained in some cases with advantage when the disease  is but starting and the animal is plethoric by direct abstraction of  blood, as in bleeding from the jugular or other veins; or by  derivatives, such as mustard, turpentine, or blisters applied to the  skin; or by setons, which draw to the surface the fluid of the blood,  thereby lessening its volume without having the disadvantage of  impoverishing the elements of the blood found in bleeding. In many cases  antipyretics given by the mouth and cold applied to the skin are most  useful.    When the irritation which is the cause of fever is a specific one,  either in the form of bacteria (living organisms), as in glanders,  tuberculosis, influenza, septicemia, etc., or in the form of a foreign  element, as in rheumatism, gout, hemaglobinuria, and other so-called  diseases of nutrition, we employ remedies which have been found to have  a direct specific action on them. Among the specific remedies for  various diseases are counted quinin, carbolic acid, salicylic acid,  antipyrene, mercury, iodin, the empyreumatic oils, tars, resins,  aromatics, sulphur, and a host of other drugs, some of which are of  known effect and others of which are theoretical in action. Certain  remedies, like simple aromatic teas, vegetable acids, such as vinegar,  lemon juice, etc., alkalines in the form of salts, sweet spirits of  niter, etc., which are household remedies, are always useful, because  they act on the excreting organs and ameliorate the effects of fever.  Other remedies, which are to be used to influence the cause of fever,  must be selected with judgment and from a thorough knowledge of the  nature of the disease.          METHODS OF ADMINISTERING MEDICINES.    By CH. B. MICHENER, V. S.    [Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]      Medicine may enter the body through any of the following designated  channels: First, by the mouth; second, by the air passages; third, by  the skin; fourth, by the tissue beneath the skin (hypodermic methods);  fifth, by the rectum; sixth, by the genito-urinary passages; and,  seventh, by the blood (intravenous injections).    BY THE MOUTH.--Medicines can be given by the mouth in the form of  solids, as powders or pills; liquids, and pastes, or electuaries.    _Powders._--Solids administered as powders should be as finely  pulverized as possible, in order to obtain rapid solution and  absorption. Their action is in this way facilitated and intensified.  Powders must be free from any irritant or caustic action upon the mouth.  Those that are without any disagreeable taste or smell are readily eaten  with the feed or taken in the drinking water. When placed with the feed  they should first be dissolved or suspended in water and thus sprinkled  on the feed. If mixed dry the horse will often leave the medicine in the  bottom of his manger. Nonirritant powders may be given in capsules, as  balls are given.    _Pills, or \"balls\"_ when properly made, are cylindrical in shape, 2  inches in length and about three-fourths of an inch in diameter. They  should be fresh, but if necessary to keep them some time they should be  made up with glycerin, or some such agent, to prevent their becoming too  hard. Very old, hard balls are sometimes passed whole with the manure  without being acted upon at all. Paper is sometimes wrapped around balls  when given, if they are so sticky as to adhere to the fingers or the  balling gun. Paper used for this purpose should be thin but firm, as the  tougher tissue papers. Balls are preferred to drenches when the medicine  is extremely disagreeable or nauseating; when the dose is not too large;  when the horse is difficult to drench; or when the medicine is intended  to act slowly. Certain medicines can not or should not be made into  balls, as medicines requiring to be given in large doses, oils, caustic  substances, unless in small dose and diluted and thoroughly mixed with  the vehicle, deliquescent, or efflorescent salts. Substances suitable  for balls can be made up by the addition of honey, sirup, soap, etc.,  when required for immediate use. Gelatin capsules of different sizes are  now obtainable and are a convenient means of giving medicines in ball  form.    When balls are to be given we should observe the following directions:  In shape they should be cylindrical, of the size above mentioned, and  soft enough to be easily compressed by the fingers. If made round or  egg-shaped, if too long or too hard, they are liable to become fixed in  the gullet and cause choking. Balls may be given with the \"balling gun\"  (obtainable at any veterinary instrument maker's) or by the hand. If  given by the hand a mouth speculum or gag may be used to prevent the  animal from biting the hand or crushing the ball. Always loosen the  horse before attempting to give a ball; if tied he may break his halter  and injure himself or the one giving the ball. With a little practice it  is much easier to give a ball without the mouth gag, as the horse always  fights more or less against having his mouth forced open. The tongue  must be firmly grasped with the left hand and gently pulled forward; the  ball, slightly moistened, is then to be placed with the tips of the  fingers of the right hand as far back into the mouth as possible; as the  tongue is loosened it is drawn back into the mouth and carries the ball  backward with it. The mouth should be kept closed for a minute or two.  We should always have a pail of water at hand to offer the horse after  balling. This precaution will often prevent him from coughing out the  ball or its becoming lodged in the gullet.    _Pastes or electuaries_ are medicines mixed with licorice-root powder,  ground flaxseed, molasses, or sirup to the consistency of honey, or a  \"soft solid.\" They are intended, chiefly, to act locally upon the mouth  and throat. They are given by being spread upon the tongue, gums, or  teeth with a wooden paddle or strong, long-handled spoon.    _Liquids._--It is, very often, impossible to get balls properly made, or  to induce owners or attendants to attempt to give them, and for these  reasons medicines by the mouth are mostly given in the form of liquids.  Liquids may be given as drenches when the dose is large, or they may,  when but a small quantity is administered, be injected into the mouth  with a hard-rubber syringe or be poured upon the tongue from a small  vial.    When medicine is to be given as a drench we must be careful to use water  or oil enough to dissolve or dilute it thoroughly; more than this Wakes  the drench bulky and is unnecessary. Insoluble medicines, if not  irritant or corrosive, may be given simply suspended in water, the  bottle to be well shaken immediately before giving the drench. The  bottle used for drenching purposes should be clean, strong, and smooth  about its neck; it should be without shoulders, tapering, and of a size  to suit the amount to be given. A horn or tin bottle may be better,  because it is not so easily broken by the teeth. If the dose is a small  one the horse's head may be held up by the left hand, while the medicine  is poured into the mouth by the right. The left thumb is to be placed in  the angle of the lower jaw, and the fingers spread out in such manner  as to support the lower lip. Should the dose be large, the horse ugly,  or the attendant unable to support the head as directed above, the head  is then to be held up by running the tines of a long-handled wooden fork  under the noseband of the halter or the halter strap or a rope may be  fastened to the noseband and thrown over a limb, beam, or through a  pulley suspended from the ceiling. Another way of supporting the head is  to place a loop in the end of a rope, and introduce this loop into the  mouth just behind the upper front teeth or tusks of the upper jaw, the  free end to be run through a pulley, as before described, and held by an  assistant. It is never to be fastened, as the horse might in that case  do himself serious injury. The head is to be elevated just enough to  prevent the horse from throwing the liquid out of his mouth. The line of  the face should be horizontal, or only the least bit higher. If the head  is drawn too high the animal can not swallow with ease or even with  safety. (If this is doubted, just fill your mouth with water, throw-back  the head as far as possible, and then try to swallow.) The person giving  the drench should stand on some object in order to reach the horse's  mouth--on a level, or a little above it. The bottle or horn is then to  be introduced at the side of the mouth, in front of the molar teeth, in  an upward direction. This will cause the horse to open his mouth, when  the base of the bottle is to be elevated, and about 4 ounces of the  liquid allowed to escape on the tongue as far back as possible, care  being taken not to get the neck of the bottle between the back teeth.  The bottle is to be immediately removed, and if the horse does not  swallow this can be encouraged by rubbing the fingers or neck of the  bottle against the roof of the mouth, occasionally removing them. As  soon as this is swallowed repeat the operation until he has taken all  the drench. If coughing occurs, or if, by any mishap, the bottle should  be crushed in the mouth, lower the head immediately.    Do not rub, pinch, or pound the throat nor draw out the tongue when  giving a drench. These processes in no way aid the horse to swallow and  oftener do harm than good. In drenching, swallowing may be hastened by  pouring into the nose of the horse, while the head is high, a few  teaspoonfuls of clean water, but _drenches must never be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],[0,"The Works of Lord Byron.

I must find Sfero,                200      And bring him a new spear with his own helmet.[w]      He fights till now bare-headed, and by far      Too much exposed. The soldiers knew his face,      And the foe too; and in the moon's broad light,      His silk tiara and his flowing hair      Make him a mark too royal. Every arrow      Is pointed at the fair hair and fair features,      And the broad fillet which crowns both.        _Myr._                                 Ye Gods,      Who fulminate o'er my father's land, protect him!
