She has told us how one day she was  sitting in her palace, and thinking of her Creator, when the thought  came into her mind to rear two great obelisks before the Temple of Amen  at Karnak. So she gave the command, and Sen-mut, her clever architect,  went up the Nile to Aswan, and quarried two huge granite blocks, and  floated them down the river. Cleopatra's Needle, which stands on the  Thames Embankment, is 68-1/2 feet high, and it seems to us a huge stone  for men to handle. Our own engineers had trouble enough in bringing it  to this country, and setting it up. But these two great obelisks of  Queen Hatshepsut were 98-1/2 feet high, and weighed about 350 tons  apiece. Yet Sen-mut had them quarried, and set up, and carved all over  from base to summit in seven months from the time when the Queen gave  her command! One of them still stands at Karnak, the tallest obelisk in  the temple there; while the other great shaft has fallen, and lies  broken, close to its companion. They tell us their own plain story of  the wisdom and skill of those far-off days; and perhaps the great Queen  who thought of her Creator as she sat in her palace, and longed to  honour Him, found that the God whom she ignorantly worshipped was indeed  not far from His servant's heart.          CHAPTER XI    EGYPTIAN BOOKS      The Egyptians were, if not quite the earliest, at least among the  earliest of all the peoples of the world to find out how to put down  their thoughts in writing, or in other words, to make a book; and one of  their old books, full of wise advice from a father to his son, is,  perhaps, the oldest book in the world. Two words which we are constantly  using might help to remind us of how much we owe to their cleverness.  The one is \"Bible,\" and the other is \"paper.\" When we talk of the Bible,  which just means \"the Book,\" we are using one of the words which the  Greeks used to describe the plant out of which the Egyptians made the  material on which they wrote; and when we talk of paper, we are using  another name, the commoner name, of the same plant. For the Egyptians  were the first people to make paper, and they used it for many centuries  before other people had learned how much handier it was than the other  things which they used.    Yet, if you saw an Egyptian book, you would think it was a very curious  and clumsy thing indeed, and very different from the handy volumes which  we use nowadays. When an Egyptian wanted to make a book, he gathered the  stems of a kind of reed called the papyrus, which grew in some parts of  Egypt in marshy ground. This plant grew to a height of from 12 to 15  feet, and had a stalk about 6 inches thick. The outer rind was peeled  off this stalk, and then the inner part of it was separated, by means  of a flat needle, into thin layers. These layers were joined to one  another on a table, and a thin gum was spread over them, and then  another layer was laid crosswise on the top of the first. The double  sheet thus made was then put into a press, squeezed together, and dried.  The sheets varied, of course, in breadth according to the purpose for  which they were needed. The broadest that we know of measure about 17  inches across, but most are much narrower than that.    When the Egyptian had got his paper, he did not make it up into a volume  with the sheets bound together at the back, as we do. He joined them end  to end, adding on sheet after sheet as he wrote, and rolling up his book  as he went along; so when the book was done it formed a big roll,  sometimes many feet long. There is one great book in the British Museum  which measures 135 feet in length. You would think it very strange and  awkward to have to handle a book like that.    But if the book seemed curious to you, the writing in it would seem  still more curious; for the Egyptian writing was certainly the  quaintest, and perhaps the prettiest, that has ever been known. It is  called \"hieroglyphic,\" which means \"sacred carving,\" and it is nothing  but little pictures from beginning to end. The Egyptians began by  putting down a picture of the thing which was represented by the word  they wanted to use, and, though by-and-by they formed a sort of alphabet  to spell words with, and had, besides, signs that represented the  different syllables of a word, still, these signs were all little  pictures. For instance, one of their signs for _a_ was the figure of an  eagle; their sign for _m_ was a lion, and for _u_ a little chicken; so  that when you look at an Egyptian book written in the hieroglyphic  character, you see column after column of birds and beasts and creeping  things, of men and women and boats, and all sorts of other things,  marching across the page.    When the Egyptians wanted any of their writings to last for a very long  time, they did not trust them to the frail papyrus rolls, but used  another kind of book altogether. You have heard of \"sermons in stones\"?  Well, a great many of the Egyptian books that tell us of the great deeds  of the Pharaohs were written on stone, carved deep and clear in the hard  granite of a great obelisk, or in the limestone of a temple wall. When  one of the Kings came back from the wars, he generally published the  account of his battles and victories by carving them on the walls of one  of the great temples, or on a pillar set up in the court of a temple,  and there they remain to this day for scholars to read.    When the hieroglyphics were cut in stone, the lines were often filled in  with pastes of different colours, so that the whole writing was a blaze  of beautiful tints, and the walls looked as if they were covered with  finely-coloured hangings. Of course, the colours have mostly faded now;  but there are still some temples and tombs where they can be seen,  almost as fresh as when they were first laid on, and from these we can  gather some idea of how wonderfully beautiful were these stone books of  ancient Egypt. The scribes and carvers knew very well how beautiful  their work was, and were careful to make it look as beautiful as  possible; so much so, that if they found that the grouping of figures to  make up a particular word or sentence was going to be ugly or clumsy,  they would even prefer to spell the word wrong, rather than spoil the  appearance of their picture-writing. Some of you, I dare say, spell  words wrong now and again; but I fancy it isn't because you think they  look prettier that way.    But now let us turn back again to our papyrus roll. Suppose that we have  got it, clean and fresh, and that our friend the scribe is going to  write upon it. How does he go about it? To begin with, he draws from his  belt a long, narrow wooden case, and lays it down beside him. This is  his palette; rather a different kind of palette from the one which  artists use. It is a piece of wood, with one long hollow in it, and two  or three shallow round ones. The long hollow holds a few pens, which are  made out of thin reeds, bruised at the ends, so that their points are  almost like little brushes. The shallow round hollows are for holding  ink--black for most of the writing, red for special words, and perhaps  one or two other colours, if the scribe is going to do a very fine piece  of work. So he squats down, cross-legged, dips a reed-pen in the ink,  and begins. As he writes he makes his little figures of men and beasts  and birds face all in the one direction, and his readers will know that  they must always read from the point towards which the characters face.  Now and then, when he comes to some specially important part, he draws,  in gay colours, a little picture of the scene which the words describe.    Now, you can understand that this picture-writing was not very easy work  to do when you had nothing but a bruised reed to draw all sorts of  animals with. Gradually the pictures grew less and less like the  creatures they stood for to begin with, and at last the old hieroglyphic  broke down into a kind of running hand, where a stroke or two might  stand for an eagle, a lion, or a man. And very many of the Egyptian  books are written in this kind of broken-down hieroglyphic, which is  called \"hieratic,\" or priestly writing. But some of the finest and  costliest books were still written in the beautiful old style.    On their papyrus rolls the Egyptians wrote all sorts of things--books of  wise advice, stories like the fairy-tales which we have been hearing,  legends of the gods, histories, and poems; but the book that is oftenest  met with is one of their religious books. It is nearly always called the  \"Book of the Dead\" now, and some people call it the Egyptian Bible, but  neither of these names is the right one. Certainly, it is not in the  least like the Bible, and the Egyptians themselves never called it the  Book of the Dead. They called it \"The Chapters of Coming Forth by Day,\"  and the reason they gave it that name was because they believed that if  their dead friends knew all the wisdom that was written in it, they  would escape all the dangers of the other world, and would be able in  heaven to go in and out just as they had done upon earth, and to be  happy for ever.    The book is full of all kinds of magical charms against the serpents and  dragons and all the other kinds of evil things that sought to destroy  the dead person in the other world. The scribes used to write off copies  of it by the dozen, and keep them in stock, with blank places for the  names of the persons who were to use them. When anyone died, his  friends went away to a scribe, and bought a roll of the Book of the  Dead, and the scribe filled in the name of the dead person in the blank  places. Then the book was buried along with his mummy, so that when he  met the demons and serpents on the road to heaven, he would know"]]]
