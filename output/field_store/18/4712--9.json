Another young cavalier was  also sent away on a similar expedition, and both returned with  favourable reports as to the inexhaustible wealth of the district.  Thus, with more satisfaction than he had expected, Columbus was able to  send back the ships to Spain.  He recommended various persons to the  notice of the sovereigns, to whom he sent a petition for provisions,  wine, medicine, clothing, arms, horses, to be dispatched to the colony  with all speed.  He sent also the men, women, and children taken in the  Caribbean Islands, recommending that they should be carefully instructed  in the Spanish language and the Christian faith.  In his ignorant zeal  for promulgating that faith, he proposed to establish an exchange of the  cannibal pagans as slaves, against live stock to be furnished to the  colony, fancying that these slaves would be thus converted to the  Catholic faith.    The sovereigns, however, did not agree with his ideas, but ordered that  the Caribs should be converted like the rest of the islanders.    The city of Isabella having made considerable progress, the church being  open for service, Columbus prepared to lead an expedition to the  mountains of Cibao.    Jealousy of Columbus' superior merits and the rewards he had received  had been for some time rankling in the hearts of some of his officers.  As he was about to set off on his expedition, a mutiny was designed, but  discovered before it broke out, and the leader, Bernal Diaz, was  confined on board one of the ships, to be sent to Spain for trial.    Columbus now commenced the proposed expedition, leaving his brother Don  Diego in command of the city and the ships.  He was well received by the  natives wherever he went, and was fully satisfied that the region was  prolific in gold.  To secure it he built a fortress called Saint Thomas,  to the command of which he appointed Pedro Margarite, and garrisoned it  with fifty-six men.    Delighted with all he had seen, Columbus returned to Isabella on the  29th of March.  Great progress had been made, and many of the seeds had  already sprung up, bearing fruit.  Unfortunately, however, bread had  become scarce, and there was no means of grinding wheat.  Disease also  had attacked the settlers, and many persons of all ranks had died.  He  was, however, anxious to proceed on his voyage of discovery, and  supposing that he could trust his subordinates, he left ample  instructions for their conduct.  He directed Margarite, with a strong  force, to explore the province of Cibao, while Ojeda was to assume the  command of Saint Thomas.  One of the objects of the expedition was to  secure the persons of any chiefs who had exhibited hostile feelings  towards the Spaniards.  Several were thus captured and sent in chains to  Isabella.  At length Columbus, satisfied that the colony would go on  well, set sail, intending to visit the coast of Cuba at the point where  he had abandoned it, and thence to explore it on the south side.  He, it  must be remembered, supposed it to be the extreme end of Asia, and that  by following its shores he must at length arrive at Cathay, and those  other rich countries described by Mandeville and Marco Polo.    Having visited La Navidad, where Guacanagari kept out of the way, he  continued his course westward, until he reached the port of Saint  Nicholas, whence he beheld the extreme point of Cuba.  Having crossed  the channel, he sailed along the southern coast of that island for a  distance of twenty leagues, until he entered a harbour, which from its  size he called Puerto Grande.  Going on shore, he arrived at some  cottages, where, although the inhabitants had fled, great quantities of  fish, utias, and iguanas were found, some hung up, others roasting  before the fires.  The Spaniards, who had long been fasting, satisfied  their appetites on the food, and then set out to explore the country.  On their way they saw a party of Indians, collected on the top of a  rock, looking down upon them with astonishment.    Though most of the natives ran off, one remained, whose apprehensions  were quickly dispelled by the friendly way the young Lucayan interpreter  spoke to him.  Going after his companions, he soon brought them back.  They assured Columbus that he was welcome to the food which had been  consumed; but he, with his usual liberality, directed that ample  compensation should be made to them.    The next harbour in which he brought up he called Saint Jago de Cuba.  Here he was treated with the usual simple hospitality of the natives.  Wherever he went he inquired for gold, and the natives invariably  pointed to the south, intimating that the country abounded with gold in  that direction.    He therefore, without delay, steered in search of this reported island.  He had not sailed many leagues before the summits of lofty mountains  were seen rising above the horizon.  As he approached the island he was  struck with the beauty of its scenery, the majesty of its forests, the  fertility of its valleys, and the number of its villages.    In a short time seventy canoes filled with savages, gaily-painted, and  decorated with feathers, paddled off a league from the shore, uttering  loud yells, and brandishing lances of pointed wood.  They were quickly  soothed, however, by the interpreter, and a few gifts bestowed upon  them, so that they did not molest the ship.    Coasting westward, Columbus, finding a sheltered harbour, made  preparations for careening the ship, which leaked.  As he was entering,  the boats sounding ahead, two canoes came up, filled with Indians, who  hurled their darts; but wishing to avoid any act of hostility, he  ordered the boats to return and, standing on, came to an anchor.    Directly afterwards the whole beach was covered with savages, painted  chiefly with black, and all wearing coronets of feathers.  They showed  their hostile intentions by hurling their javelins towards the ship,  making the shores ring with their war-whoops.    As further forbearance might have been mistaken for cowardice, the  Admiral sent a boat on shore full of well-armed men, who let fly a  volley of arrows from their crossbows, wounding several Indians, and  throwing the rest into confusion.  They then sprang on shore and let  loose a dog, who pursued them with sanguinary fury.  This was the first  time bloodhounds had been used against the natives, afterwards to be  employed with such cruel effect by the Spaniards in their Indian wars.    Columbus then landed and took formal possession of the island, which he  called Santiago, but it has retained its original Indian name of  Jamaica.    Notwithstanding this unpleasant commencement, the natives soon entered  into a friendly intercourse with their visitors.  Columbus was struck  with the appearance of their canoes, which were carved and painted, many  of them being of large size, formed of the trunk of a single tree.  He  measured one, which was ninety-six feet long and eight broad, hollowed  out of a species of mahogany-tree.    He now coasted along the northern shore of Jamaica, the natives  everywhere coming off and trading without fear.  At the last place where  he touched in Jamaica a young Indian came off and begged the Spaniards  to take him to their country.  Notwithstanding the tears and  supplications of his friends, he persisted in his request, and Columbus  ordered that he should be received on board and treated with kindness.    As the wind at the western end of Jamaica was found to be contrary,  Columbus resolved to return to Cuba, and not to leave it until he had  explored its coast sufficiently to determine whether it was _terra  firma_ or an island.

Standing across to Cuba, Columbus reached Cabo de la Cruz, near which,  landing, he was cordially received by the cacique and his subjects, who  had long since heard of him.  The Admiral endeavoured to ascertain from  the cacique whether Cuba was an island or a continent.  The reply was  such as to induce him to believe that it was the latter.    Meeting with a storm, fortunately of short duration, he soon found  himself among a labyrinth of keys and small islands, so numerous that it  was impossible to count them.  To these he gave the name of The Queen's  Gardens.  At first he thought of leaving this archipelago to the right,  and standing out to sea; but he recollected that Sir John Mandeville and  Marco Polo had mentioned that the coast"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23495"],[0,"The Story of the Greeks (#12)"],[1," man had jostled the image of Theagenes a little more roughly  than usual, the heavy marble toppled and fell, crushing him to death  beneath its weight.    When the priests came into the temple the next day, and found the man's  dead body under the great statue, they were very much surprised. The  judges assembled, as was the custom when a crime of any kind had been  committed, to decide what had caused his death.    As it was usual in Greece to hold judgment over lifeless as well as over  living things, the statue of Theagenes was brought into court, and  accused and found guilty of murder.    The judges then said, that, as the statue had committed a crime, it  deserved to be punished, and so they condemned it to be cast into the  sea and drowned. This sentence had scarcely been executed, when a plague  broke out in Greece; and when the frightened people consulted an oracle  to find out how it could be checked, they learned that it would not  cease until the statue of Theagenes had been set up on its pedestal  again. The superstitious Greeks believed these words, fished the statue  up out of the sea, and placed it again in Olympia. As the plague stopped  shortly after this, they all felt sure that it was because they had  obeyed the oracle, and they ever after looked upon the statue with great  awe.          XXXII. THE GIRLS' GAMES.      Although the women and girls were not often allowed to appear in public,  or to witness certain of the Olympic games, there were special days held  sacred to them, when the girls also strove for prizes.    They too ran races; and it must have been a pretty sight to see all  those healthy, happy girls running around the stadium, as the foot-race  course was called.    One of these races was called the torch race, for each runner carried a  lighted torch in her hand. All were allowed to try to put out each  other's light; and the prize was given to the maiden who first reached  the goal with her torch aflame, or to the one who kept hers burning  longest.    The prize for the girls was the same as that given to the boys; but the  boys took part in more games, and were present in greater numbers,  than the girls, and their victories were praised much more than those of  their sisters.    [Illustration: A Torch Race.]    The crowd of people watching the games often grew so excited that they  carried the victor all around the grounds on their shoulders, while  Olympia fairly re-echoed with their cries of joy.    We are also told that one old man called Chi'lo was so happy when his  son laid at his feet the crowns he had just won, that he actually died  of joy, thus turning his son's happiness into bitter grief.    While all the foot races took place in the stadium, the horse and  chariot races were held in the hippodrome, and excited the greatest  interest. There were two-, four-, and eight-horse races; and, as the  horses were sometimes unruly, the chariots were liable to be overturned.  Thus at times a number of horses would fall in a heap, and lie  struggling and kicking in the dust, which added to the general  excitement.          XXXIII. THE BLOODY LAWS OF DRACO.      You have already learned that Athens was one of the greatest cities of  ancient Greece, and that after the heroic self-sacrifice of Codrus the  inhabitants would not allow any one to bear the name of king.    The sons of Codrus were named archons, or rulers for life,--an office  which was at first handed down from father to son, but which soon became  elective; that is to say, all the people voted for and elected their  own rulers. Then nine archons were chosen at once, but they kept their  office for only one year.    As these men received no pay for serving the state, only the richest  citizens could accept the office; and thus Athens, from a monarchy, or  country ruled by a king, became an oligarchy, or state ruled by the rich  and noble citizens.    As the rich thus held the reins of the government, they often used their  power to oppress the poor, and this gave rise to many quarrels. Little  by little the two parties, the rich and the poor, grew to hate each  other so much that it was decided that a new code or set of laws should  be made, and that they should be obeyed by all alike.    A severe archon called Dra'co was chosen to draw up these new laws (602  B.C.); and he made them so strict and cruel that the least sin was  punished as if it had been a crime, and a man was sentenced to be hanged  for stealing even a cabbage.    When the Athenians heard these new laws, they were frightened. Such  severity had never been known before; and one and all said that the laws  had been written in blood instead of ink. Some of the citizens, hoping  to make Draco change them, asked why he had named such a terrible  punishment for so small a crime as the theft of a cabbage. Draco sternly  replied that a person who stole even the smallest thing was dishonest,  and deserved death; and that, as he knew of no severer punishment, he  could not inflict one for the greater crimes.    The Athenians had all promised to obey Draco's laws, so they were  obliged to submit for a short time. Then, driven wild by their  strictness, rich and poor rose up, drove the unhappy lawmaker out of the  city, and forced him to go to the neighboring Island of AE-gi'na. Here  Draco spent all the rest of his life.    The people were now in a state of great uncertainty. The laws of Draco  were too severe, but they had no others to govern the city. While they  were hesitating, not knowing what to do, Cy'lon, an Athenian citizen,  tried to make himself king.    His first move was to gather together a few of his friends, and go  secretly to the Acropolis, or fortress of Athens, which he took by  surprise. Now that he was master of the fortress, he tried to force the  Athenians to recognize him as their king, but this they stoutly refused  to do.    Instead of yielding, the Athenians armed themselves, met the rebels in a  bloody battle, and killed Cylon himself in the midst of the fight.    As their leader was now dead, and they feared the anger of their  fellow-citizens, Cylon's friends fled in haste to the temple of the  goddess Athene. Once inside the sacred building, they felt quite safe;  for no person could be killed in a temple, or be taken out of it by  force.    Although they had neither food nor drink, the rebels refused to leave  the temple, until the archon Meg'a-cles, fearing that they would die  there, and thus defile the temple, promised to do them no harm if they  would only come out.    The rebels did not quite trust to this promise, so they came out of the  temple holding a small cord, one end of which was fastened to the statue  of the goddess. They were thus still under her protection, and any one  touching them would be guilty of a great crime.    When the men reached the street at the bottom of the hill where the  temple stood, the cord to which they were all clinging suddenly broke.  Megacles, the first to notice this, said that the goddess refused to  protect the rebels any longer, and gave orders to kill the unhappy men.          XXXIV. THE LAWS OF SOLON.      Shortly after the death of Cylon and the murder of his followers, a  great many troubles came upon the city of Athens. The people were  frightened, and soon the friends of Cylon began to whisper that the gods  were surely punishing the Athenians, and especially Megacles, for  breaking his promise.    This report spread throughout the city. The terrified people assembled,  and voted to exile Megacles and all his family, the Alc-mae-on'i-dae. Such  was the fury of the Athenians against the archon whose crime had brought  misfortunes upon them, that they even dug up the bones of his ancestors,  and had them carried beyond the boundary of Attica.    The city had been defiled by the crime which Megacles had committed, and  the people felt that they would never be prosperous again until Athens  had been purified; but the great question was to find a man holy enough  to perform the ceremony.    After much talking, they decided to send for Ep-i-men'i-des, and to ask  him to purify the city. This man, when a mere lad, once went into a cave  near his native town, and there laid himself down to sleep. Instead of  taking an ordinary nap, however, he slept fifty-eight years, without  awakening or undergoing any change. When he came out of the cave, where  he fancied he had spent only a few hours, he was surprised to find  everything new and strange to him.    His relatives had all died, no one knew him, and it was only after some  time had passed that he found out that he had slept fifty-eight years at  a stretch. This man was a poet of note, and, as he had enjoyed so long a  sleep, the people thought that he was a favorite of the gods.    When the Athenians asked him to purify the town, he came to do so; but  when the ceremonies were ended, he refused to accept any of the rich  gifts which the people offered him as reward. Instead, he humbly begged  them to give him a twig of the sacred olive tree which they said Athene  herself had planted on the Acropolis.    Their troubles having now ceased, the Athenians began to think of making  another and less severe code of laws. This time they chose as lawmaker a  wise man called So'lon, a descendant of the noble Codrus; and he soon  consented to tell them what to do.    Solon was a studious and thoughtful man, and had acquired much of his  wisdom by traveling, and by learning all he could from the people he  visited. He knew so much that he was called a sage, and he loved to  meet and talk with wise people.    Solon changed many of Draco's severe laws, arranged that the farmers and  poor people should no longer be treated badly by the rich, and even took  care of the slaves. He also gave the Athenians a court of law called  A-re-op'a-gus. Here there were jurymen to judge all criminals; and here,  for the first time, an accused person was"]]]
