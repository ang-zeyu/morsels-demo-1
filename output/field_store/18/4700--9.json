[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22886"],[0,"Cinderella in the South: Twenty-Five South African Tales (#12)"],[1,"Mr. Smythe began quite conclusively. Yet there was more  moderation and more argument in his rather indistinct beginning  than in the flowing harangue that followed, when his voice  cleared and his periods found their stride. The speech fell from  level to level. Ere the end it fell to the level of that sort of  invective against natives one hears so often where mean whites  forgather a not very dizzy level, believe me!    Finally, Mr. Smythe vowed to give no penny for the future to  Church purposes, and never to darken the doors of the new  Cathedral, should the concession of those leper windows be  confirmed. He would agree to forfeit a thousand pounds should he  break his word, he said. Thereupon they closed the subject. The  host tried to lead back to the cults of the Greek States, but the  guest was now too rapt and breathless to follow to much purpose.  Soon, by mutual consent, they ended the interview, not without  private friendliness, but with civic war at heart.    This was in Christmas week, and things went much as might have  been expected during the months that followed. The concession had  been granted by the Committee, and the concessionaire thought it  his duty to be grateful for that small mercy and to act upon it.  The malcontent repeated his vow, and it rang throughout the  village-city. A good many of the natives who worshipped at the  tin temple managed to hear of it, and laughed to one another;  they would watch for the darkening of the doors.    The Cathedral was to be dedicated to Saint Mark as a saint who  was martyred in Africa, but lacked a cathedral in the south.    His day was chosen for the hallowing. On the eve some pomp of  Procession, Recession, and Anthems had been prepared, and the  Bishop was to preach. He had been away much of these last months  to north, south, east and west. So custom had not staled his  variety of appeal to the outer circle of citizens or villagers.  They, as well as the devotees, thronged the nave. At the leper  windows there were knots of dark participants in the service.    The windows gave; a few the chance of sight, but they were only  five in number, and it would seem that many had to be content  with very scanty views. It is questionable whether a number of  the smaller folk nurse-boys, kitchen boys and telegraph  messengers got any sort of a glance ere the pageantry was over.    The night was very clear; the autumn wind was somewhat bitter.    The hymn after the Blessing had been reached 'Brief life is here  our portion' and the banners streamed down the central aisle in  glory. The leper windows grew very starry with observation.    One boy who had come late had no chance of a view now. He was the  Bishop's coachman, a lanky Bechuana, and he stood humming the  hymn's air with his back to a window a window near the western  door. Suddenly he started. Somebody was striding up to the porch.  Surely there was no mistaking Mr. Conyers Smythe's fine shoulders  in that figure nor the jaunty carriage of his massive head. Now  he drew near, and the light of the porch-lamp fell upon him.    The coachman caught the arm of his stable-boy, who was standing  next to him a rather Jewish-looking Mashona.    'Look! look!' he cried.    They both watched the churchgoer as he passed up the steps. Then  he was gone from their view.    In the afternoon of the next day, when the triumphal services of  Dedication were over, the Bishop was being driven to a farmhouse  not very far distant. It was not till his mule-cart had almost  reached home again that his driver ventured to question him. He  had seemed rather preoccupied that driver all the dusty journey.  Now he asked a question that was being wildly debated in native  circles that very afternoon. 'My lord, has Mr. Smythe paid all  the thousand pounds yet?'    The Bishop started and stared; then he laughed. 'What do you know  of Mr. Smythe's thousand pounds?' he asked. Then he answered,  'No, Jack; why should he?'    Why indeed? So Mombe, the ox-man to give him his native name was  trying to evade his obligations, was he? Almost bursting with  importance, Jack told his master what Jim and he had seen last  night. The Bishop listened carefully, and asked two or three  questions. Then he told Jack that he might want him and his  stable-boy later on that evening. He felt sure that the story was  no mere willful fiction. When they were home he wrote a letter to  Smythe asking him if he could come over and smoke after dinner.  Then he went off to his sunset Evensong.    Conyers Smythe came about an hour afterwards. The Bishop and he  had had but two bookish evenings together since that rather  bizarre one in Christmas week. They met cordially enough on this  April night.    Smythe was looking far from well. He had been worried about his  wife's health she was away in England. The last news of it had  been rather disquieting. Smythe was glad enough of sympathy; he  was in no truculent mood.    They smoked by the fire in the Bishop's study as the night was  cold. The Bishop had some new books to show and points to debate.    The two began with Greek pagan cults, but passed on to Christian  hagiology, and discussed the legend of St. Mark with a fair  measure of agreement. Then, when the coffee had come in, and they  had I become friends at ease and amity, the Bishop told Smythe  the boys' tale.    Smythe grew curiously white and seemed angry.    Then he laughed. 'Let's have 'em in and hear their yarn!' he  said.    So Jack and Jim were sent for, and, after some slight delay,  appeared. They were well washed and in their Sunday clothes. They  were disposed to be deferential enough, but withal very  confident, both of them. They cast somewhat awed glances at  Smythe in his armchair, but they told their tale clearly on the  whole, in fair Biblical English, Jack first, slowly, and Jim, at  a great pace, after his superior. Smythe appeared to be busily  consulting a reference while Jim was ending. There was a pause.  Then the guest looked up from his book and stated his alibi: 'I  was in my stable, sitting up with a sick horse,' he said. 'I came  away long after the church service was over when the poor beast  died with frothing at the nose. You can ask my stable-boy.'    Jack bowed his head respectfully. 'Your stableboy, Mutenu, has  told me so this evening,' he said. 'But, O master, why should we  lie? Is it not known that people have been seen in two places at  one time'?'    Smythe frowned. He was not anxious to discuss hypotheses with  natives. Then the Bishop told the boys that he had heard enough.  Let them think that although they had spoken truth, they had been  mistaken.    'How do you explain it?' said the Bishop rather eagerly when they  had gone out.    'O,' said Smythe with a rather bitter smile, 'supposing it not to  be a native lie--natives have been known to lie, my lord--it's  the sort of story one reads about in the Middle Ages, the sort of  legend likely to linger. He was seen going into a church on a  certain ill-starred night.'    The Bishop gave a start and interrupted him. 'Do you know what  yesterday evening was? Why, it was Saint Mark's Eve.'    Smythe smiled a queer livid smile. 'Yes, I thought of that all  along, since the boy mentioned the porch,' he said. 'I've just  been looking up the old belief in that new book of yours. I was  seen going in, therefore I must look to go out in these next  twelve months.    A year, a month, a week, a natural day  That Faustus may repent and save his soul!  O lente, lente currite, noctis equi!  The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike,  The devil will come, and Faustus will be damn'd.    The Bishop smiled at the quotation, but looked anxiously at his  guest. Was he really taking his subliminal self's choice of date  to heart? He proceeded to recount his own unfaith in thirteen's  black magic, also in the traditional properties of salt and  broken mirrors. He gave instances of disproof in his own unended  career.    But Smythe, though he laughed with him, seemed rather restrained  and silent: the last hour of that evening appeared to hang fire  somehow. Towards the end of it, Smythe talked of his wife. 'She  is at her old home,' he said, and mentioned a village very near  to Oxford.    'I know,' said his host, looking into the wood fire. He was  watching the Cherwell swirl through a narrow archway. He was  conscious of heavenly blue in the white limbo ceiling above him,  and the cushions of his chair had a grassy feel.    'She's gone home,' said Smythe, 'and she's not well, and I've not  been well.'    'You look as if you want rest and change,' said the Bishop  uneasily.    'I think of going a trip to the old country,' said Smythe. 'I was  born out here, and haven't ever seen it. I'd like to see it  once.'    'O, do go,' said his host. 'It is worth going far. Yes, all that  long way.'    Not many minutes after they said good-night.    But the Bishop did not go to bed at once after his guest had  gone. He reached for his Keats, and read, 'The Eve of Saint  Mark'; then he reflected.    'Strange are the uses of leper windows,' he thought. 'How I  should like to know what I may know this time next year, if only  I didn't know I'd better not know it now! Well, be it a sign or a  mock sign, God see him through with it!'    Conyers Smythe started home by the next mail boat save one. The  same boat carried a letter in the Bishop's handwriting to a  pastoral divine in Oxford.    'He's a sick sheep, anyhow,' said the writer, 'and I've a  presentiment that he mayn't last out a year.'    As it befell, Conyers Smythe died rather suddenly in England  before November was over. People remarked on the dreadfulness of  the event. But Mrs. Smythe bore the shock bravely, as if she had  been well prepared to bear it. It seemed that she had known the  truth about his heart-disease in May, almost as soon as he was  told it by the London doctor.

And  I have heard from very credible Eye-witnesses some things, and seen  some others my self, which argue so strongly, that a circulated Salt,  or a _Menstruum_ (such as it may be) may by being abstracted from  compound Bodies, whether Mineral, Animal, or Vegetable, leave them  more unlockt than a wary Naturalist would easily beleeve, that I dare  not confidently measure the Power of Nature and Art by that of the  _Menstruums_, and other Instruments that eminent Chymists themselves  are as yet wont to Empoly [Errata: employ] about the Analyzing of  Bodies; nor Deny that a _Menstruum_ may at least from this or that  particular Concrete obtain some apparently similar Substance,  differing from any obtainable from the same Body by any degree or  manner of Application of the Fire. And I am the more backward to deny  peremptorily, that there may be such Openers of compound Bodies,  because among the Experiments that make me speak thus warily, there  wanted not some in which it appear'd not, that one of the Substances  not separable by common Fires and _Menstruums_ could retain any thing  of the Salt by which the separation was made.    And here, _Eleutherius_, (sayes _Carneades_) I should conclude as much  of my Discourse as belongs to the first Consideration I propos'd, but  that I foresee, that what I have delivered will appear liable to two  such specious Objections, that I cannot safely proceed any further  till I have examin'd them.    And first, one sort of Opposers will be forward to tell me, That they  do not pretend by Fire alone to separate out of all compound Bodies  their _Hypostatical_ Principles; it being sufficient that the Fire  divides them into such, though afterwards they employ other Bodies to  collect the similar parts of the Compound; as 'tis known, that though  they make use of water to collect the Saline parts of Ashes from the  Terrestrial wherewith they are blended, yet it is the Fire only that  Incinerates Bodies, and reduces the fix'd part of them into the Salt  and Earth, whereof Ashes are made up. This Objection is not, I  confess, inconsiderable, and I might in great part allow of it,  without granting it to make against me, if I would content my self to  answer, that it is not against those that make it that I have been  disputing, but against those Vulgar Chymists, who themselves believe,  and would fain make others do so, That the Fire is not only an  universal, but an adaequate [Transcriber's Note: adequate] and  sufficient Instrument to analyze mixt Bodies with. For as to their  Practice of Extracting the fix'd Salt out of Ashes by the Affusion of  Water, 'tis obvious to alleadge, that the Water does only assemble  together the Salt the Fire had before divided from the Earth: as a  Sieve does not further break the Corn, but only bring together into  two distinct heaps the Flour and the Bran, whose Corpuscles before lay  promiscuously blended together in the Meal. This I say I might  alleadge, and thereby exempt my self from the need of taking any  farther notice of the propos'd Objection. But not to lose the Rise it  may afford me of Illustrating the matter under Consideration, I am  content briefly to consider it, as far forth as my present  Disquisition may be concern'd in it.    Not to repeat then what has been already answer'd, I say farther, that  though I am so civil an Adversary, that I will allow the Chymists,  after the Fire has done all its work, the use of fair Water to make  their Extractions with, in such cases wherein the Water does not  cooperate with the Fire to make the _Analysis_; yet since I Grant  this but upon Supposition that the Water does only wash off the Saline  Particles, which the Fire Alone has Before Extricated in the Analyz'd  Body, it will not be Reasonable, that this Concession should Extend to  other Liquors that may Add to what they Dissolve, nor so much as to  other Cases than those Newly Mentioned: Which Limitation I Desire You  would be Pleas'd to Bear in Mind till I shall Anon have Occasion to  make Use of it. And This being thus Premis'd, I shall Proceed to  Observe,    First, That Many of the Instances I Propos'd in the Preceding  Discourse are Such, that the Objection we are Considering will not at  all Reach Them. For Fire can no more with the Assistance of Water than  without it Separate any of the Three Principles, either from Gold,  Silver, Mercury, or some Others of the Concretes named Above.    Hence We may Inferre, That Fire is not an Universal Analyzer of all  Mixt Bodies, since of Metals and Minerals, wherein Chymists have most  Exercis'd Themselves, there Appear scarce Any which they are able to  Analyze by Fire, Nay, from which they can Unquestionably Separate so  much as any One of their Hypostatical Principles; Which may well  Appear no small Disparagement as well to their _Hypothesis_ as to  their Pretensions.    It will also remain True, notwithstanding the Objection, That there  may be Other Wayes than the wonted _Analysis_ by Fire, to Separate  from a Compound Body Substances as Homogeneneous [Transcriber's Note:  Homogeneous] as those that Chymists Scruple not to Reckon among their  _Tria Prima_ (as some of them, for Brevity Sake, call their Three  Principles.)    And it Appears, That by Convenient Additaments such Substances may be  Separated by the Help of the Fire, as could not be so by the Fire  alone: Witness the Sulphur of Antimony.    And Lastly, I must Represent, That since it appears too that the Fire  is but One of the Instruments that must be Employ'd in the Resolution  of Bodies, We may Reasonably Challenge the Liberty of doing Two  Things. For when ever any _Menstruum_ or other Additament is Employ'd,  together with the Fire to Obtain a Sulphur or a Salt from a Body, We  may well take the Freedom to Examine, whether or no That _Menstruum_  do barely Help to Separate the Principle Obtain'd by It, or whether  there Intervene not a Coalition of the Parts of the Body Wrought upon  with Those of the _Menstruum_, whereby the Produc'd Concrete may be  Judg'd to Result from the Union of Both. And it will be farther  Allowable for Us to Consider, how far any Substance, Separated by the  Help of such Additaments, Ought to pass for one of the _Tria Prima_;  since by One Way of Handling the same Mixt Body it may according to  the Nature of the Additaments, and the Method of Working upon it, be  made to Afford differing Substances from those Obtainable from it by  other Additaments, and another Method, nay and (as may appear by what  I Formerly told You about Tartar) Differing from any of the Substances  into which a Concrete is Divisible by the Fire without Additaments,  though perhaps those Additaments do not, as Ingredients, enter the  Composition of the Obtained Body, but only Diversify the Operation of  the Fire upon the Concrete; and though that Concrete by the Fire  alone may be Divided into a Number of Differing Substances, as Great  as any of the Chymists that I have met with teach us that of the  Elements to be. And having said thus much (sayes _Carneades_) to the  Objection likely to be Propos'd by some Chymists, I am now to Examine  that which I Foresee will be Confidently press'd by Divers  Peripateticks, who, to Prove Fire to be the true Analyzer of Bodies,  will Plead, That it is the very Definition of Heat given by  _Aristotle_, and Generally Received, _Congregare Homogenea, &  Heterogenea Segregare_, to Assemble Things of a Resembling, and  Disjoyn those of a Differing Nature. To this I answer, That this  Effect is far from being so Essential to Heat, as 'tis Generally  Imagin'd; for it rather Seems, that the True and Genuine Property of  Heat is, to set a Moving, and thereby to Dissociate the parts of  Bodies, and Subdivide them into Minute Particles, without regard to  their being Homogeneous or Heterogeneous, as is apparent in the  Boyling of Water, the Distillation of Quicksilver, or the Exposing of  Bodies to the action of the Fire, whose Parts either Are not (at  least in that Degree of Heat Appear not) Dissimilar, where all that  the Fire can do, is to Divide the Body into very Minute Parts which  are of the same Nature with one another, and with their _Totum_, as  their Reduction by Condensation Evinces. And even when the Fire seems  most so _Congregare Homogenea, & Segregare Heterogenea_, it Produces  that Effect but by Accident; For the Fire does but Dissolve the  Cement, or rather Shatter the Frame, or [tructure [Errata: structure]  that kept the Heterogeneous Parts of Bodies together, under one Common  Form; upon which Dissolution the Component Particles of the Mixt,  being Freed and set at Liberty, do Naturally, and oftentimes without  any Operation of the Fire, Associate themselves each with its Like, or  rather do take those places which their Several Degrees of Gravity and  Levity, Fixedness or Volatility (either Natural, or Adventitious from  the Impression of the Fire) Assigne them. Thus in the Distillation  (for Instance) of Man's Blood, the Fire do's First begin to Dissolve  the _Nexus_ or Cement of the Body; and then the Water, being the most  Volatile, and Easy to be Extracted, is either by the Igneous Atomes,  or the Agitation they are put into by the Fire, first carried up, till  Forsaken by what carried it up, its Weight sinks it down into the  Receiver: but all this while the other Principles of the Concrete  Remain Unsever'd, and Require a stronger Degree"]]]
