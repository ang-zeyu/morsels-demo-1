Perhaps  this letter lay in a warm place near the engine-rooms on the voyage.  Will you not send a timely warning? You could, for instance, say that  the measles have come out and are plainly visible, even without the  application of hot compresses. Those people are quite clever enough to  understand what you wish to convey to them.\"    This warning did not reach Harmony at the time. Perhaps the censor,  trained as he must have been in the art of reading dangerous meanings  into seemingly harmless sentences, decided in his own mind that it  would be advisable to keep the information about the measles to  himself, and consigned the letter to the waste-paper basket.    In time experience taught the conspirators at Harmony that the  greatest care would be necessary in the use of the White Envelope, and  to this they probably owe the fact that it was never found out by the  enemy.    The reproductions given here of specimens of the White Envelope,  showing the address on one side and the written messages on the other,  will give the reader an idea of how this correspondence was carried  on. We do not vouch for the accuracy of the information conveyed in  the following translation of the contents of this envelope. The  figures were quoted from memory, but the general impression conveyed  in this report, of the condition of the commandos at the time, is  reliable and correct. On the side flaps of the envelope certain love  messages were written. These have been covered over with blank paper  and are not for publication.

With Commandos all is still about the same as when I was here in      December. Much ammunition has been taken from the enemy      recently.        No want of food, horses fairly good, but clothing very scarce.        Three weeks ago I was with the Commandant-General. All well with      him. Government in good health, burghers full of courage. Good      tidings received from President Steyn.        _Everything_ plentiful in Free State.        General Botha is now in Ermelo district with 1,000 men; de la      Rey between Klerksdorp and Rustenburg, 1,500 men; Beyers near      Pietersberg, 1,000 men; Muller near Pilgrim's Rest, on Delagoa      line, with 600 or 700 men; Piet Viljoen between Heidelberg and      Middelburg, 1,200; Christian Botha, district Utrecht, 600; Smuts      has gone to the Colony with 1,500. These are the big Commandos      only. There are many small forces of 100 or a few hundred men      under petty officers. Engagements: January 15th General Botha      defeated enemy. Three wounded on our side. Enemy's loss, 46      killed, 92 wounded, 150 prisoners. 200 horses taken, 15,000      rounds of ammunition. Great victory by Commandant-General on the      3rd inst. No full report received yet.        Everywhere small engagements.        Many prisoners taken from our ranks lately, through the poor      condition of our horses. Things better now. De la Rey has had a      few small victories. On December 25th engagement under de Wet      near Frankfort. Our side victorious. A camp of 500 men taken,      150 killed and wounded, 200 captures, 2 Armstrongs taken with      400 shells; 1 Nordenbeldt with 2,500 maxim pompoms; rifle      ammunition 150,000; all the horses and cattle. The enemy is      plundered daily. Health of burghers excellent. Plenty of fruit.      Our losses, as usual, miraculously small.        Through perseverance and faith we hope to gain a certain      victory.          CHAPTER IX    JAN CELLIERS, POET AND PATRIOT      That there is more than one man of the name of Jan Celliers in South  Africa I know, but there is only one Jan Celliers who can be honoured  by the title \"Poet and Patriot,\" and that is the remarkable  personality of our friend in Pretoria, J.F.E. Celliers.    I have chosen him as the subject of this chapter, not so much because  of the important, I may almost say revolutionary part he has played in  the building up of South African literature since the war, as on  account of the unique patriotism displayed by him throughout the war  under circumstances of the severest test and trial.    How he, after active service in the field since the beginning of the  war, came to be locked up in Pretoria as an unseen prisoner of war, an  unwilling captive between the green walls of his suburban garden, when  the British took possession of the capital on that stupefying June  5th, 1900, we shall briefly relate in this chapter.    Mr. Celliers' experience was that of many good and faithful burghers.    The news of heavy Boer losses, the desperately forced march of the  British troops from Bloemfontein to Pretoria, the crushing blows in  quick succession, the departure of the Boer Administration from the  seat of government, the demoralisation of the scattered forces, and  the painful uncertainty of what the next step was to be--these things,  combined with the fact, in Mr. Celliers' case, of having no  riding-horse or bicycle on which to escape from the town, caused him  to be surprised by the wholly unexpected entry of the British forces  into the capital. Just a brief period of dazed inaction, a few hours  of stupefied uncertainty, and he found himself hopelessly cut off from  every chance of escape.    He planned escape from the beginning, for conscientious scruples  forbade his taking the oath of neutrality. Of the oath of allegiance  there was no question whatever.    There was nothing for it but to keep himself hidden until an  opportunity for escaping to his fellow-countrymen in the field  presented itself.    The first three weeks were spent in the garden, but it soon became  evident that listening ears and prying eyes were being paid to  discover his whereabouts, and closer confinement was found necessary.  Thereafter he sat between four walls, reading and writing during the  greater part of the day, keeping a watchful eye on the little front  gate through a narrow opening in the window-blind and disappearing,  through a trap-door, under the floor as soon as a soldier or official  entered the gate.    When darkness fell he left his cramped hiding-place, and gliding  unseen through the house and yard, this weary prisoner occupied  himself with exercises for the preservation of his health, running,  jumping, standing on his head, and plying the skipping-rope  vigorously, under the protecting shadows of the dark cypress trees.    The weeks went by, broken once by the intense excitement of a visit of  one of the burghers from the field.    Mrs. Celliers' brother, M. Duerr, had crept into town at dead of night  between the British sentinels on a dangerous mission for the Boers. A  short week he spent with his brother-in-law, sharing his confinement  and making plans for his escape. Then he was gone, and the old deadly  monotony settled over the house once more.    July went by, and August was nearly spent when at last an opportunity  presented itself, and Mr. Celliers, in woman's garb, bade wife and  children a passionate farewell, not to see them again for nearly two  years.    With a cloak over his shoulders and a high collar concealing his  closely cropped hair, his wife's skirt on, and a heavy veil covering a  straw hat, he stepped boldly into a small vehicle standing waiting  before his gate and drove through the streets of Pretoria. For the  time at least he too belonged to the \"Petticoat Commando.\" Mrs. Malan  was in the cart, and had been sent by Mrs. Joubert to escort him  through the town.    The disguise was taken before a thought could be given to the possible  consequences of such a step. Spurred by the heroic attitude and fine  courage displayed by his wife, Mr. Celliers lost not a moment in  availing himself of the long-looked-for opportunity.    The thrilling adventures and hairbreadth escapes he went through in  that memorable flight for duty and freedom will no doubt be found  accurately recorded in his book on the war, which I know to be \"in the  making\" at the present moment. Suffice it to say that he reached the  farm of a friend near Silkatsnek in safety, where, he had been  informed, he would find Boer commandos in the neighbourhood.    Disappointment awaited him, however. The commando had withdrawn to the  north, followed closely by thousands of British troops whose proximity  to the farm made it dangerous, not only for him, but for the people  who harboured him, to remain there longer than one night. A farm-hand,  a trusted native servant, was asked to undertake the task of escorting  Mr. Celliers to the Boer lines. After some hesitation he consented.  The risk was great, but the promise of L20 reward when the war was  over acted like a charm, and the two set forth before break of day on  their perilous adventure.    Here and there the tiny light of an outpost on the open field warned  them to make a wide _detour_. The crackling of the short burnt  stubbles of grass under their feet caused them to hold their breath  and listen with loudly beating hearts for the dreaded \"Halt! Who goes  there?\"    When the light of day began to break over earth and sky, the Kaffir,  in evident anxiety, warned the _Baas_ to hide in a large dense tree  while he, the Kaffir, went on ahead to reconnoitre. He departed--not  to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/202"],[0,"My Bondage and My Freedom (#12)"],[1," favorable impression. Aunt  Katy was a woman who never allowed herself to act greatly within the  margin of power granted to her, no matter how broad that authority might  be. Ambitious, ill-tempered and cruel, she found in her present position  an ample field for the exercise of her ill-omened qualities. She had a  strong hold on old master she was considered a first rate cook, and she  really was very industrious. She was, therefore, greatly favored by old  master, and as one mark of his favor, she was the only mother who was  permitted to retain her children around her. Even to these children she  was often fiendish in her brutality. She pursued her son Phil, one day,  in{58} my presence, with a huge butcher knife, and dealt a blow with its  edge which left a shocking gash on his arm, near the wrist. For this,  old master did sharply rebuke her, and threatened that if she ever  should do the like again, he would take the skin off her back. Cruel,  however, as Aunt Katy was to her own children, at times she was not  destitute of maternal feeling, as I often had occasion to know, in the  bitter pinches of hunger I had to endure. Differing from the practice  of Col. Lloyd, old master, instead of allowing so much for each slave,  committed the allowance for all to the care of Aunt Katy, to be divided  after cooking it, amongst us. The allowance, consisting of coarse  corn-meal, was not very abundant--indeed, it was very slender; and in  passing through Aunt Katy's hands, it was made more slender still, for  some of us. William, Phil and Jerry were her children, and it is not to  accuse her too severely, to allege that she was often guilty of starving  myself and the other children, while she was literally cramming her own.  Want of food was my chief trouble the first summer at my old master's.  Oysters and clams would do very well, with an occasional supply of  bread, but they soon failed in the absence of bread. I speak but the  simple truth, when I say, I have often been so pinched with hunger, that  I have fought with the dog--\"Old Nep\"--for the smallest crumbs that fell  from the kitchen table, and have been glad when I won a single crumb  in the combat. Many times have I followed, with eager step, the  waiting-girl when she went out to shake the table cloth, to get the  crumbs and small bones flung out for the cats. The water, in which meat  had been boiled, was as eagerly sought for by me. It was a great thing  to get the privilege of dipping a piece of bread in such water; and  the skin taken from rusty bacon, was a positive luxury. Nevertheless,  I sometimes got full meals and kind words from sympathizing old slaves,  who knew my sufferings, and received the comforting assurance that I  should be a man some day. \"Never mind, honey--better day comin',\" was  even then a solace, a cheering consolation to me in my{59} troubles. Nor  were all the kind words I received from slaves. I had a friend in the  parlor, as well, and one to whom I shall be glad to do justice, before I  have finished this part of my story.    I was not long at old master's, before I learned that his surname was  Anthony, and that he was generally called \"Captain Anthony\"--a title  which he probably acquired by sailing a craft in the Chesapeake Bay.  Col. Lloyd's slaves never called Capt. Anthony \"old master,\" but always  Capt. Anthony; and _me_ they called \"Captain Anthony Fred.\" There  is not, probably, in the whole south, a plantation where the English  language is more imperfectly spoken than on Col. Lloyd's. It is a  mixture of Guinea and everything else you please. At the time of which  I am now writing, there were slaves there who had been brought from the  coast of Africa. They never used the \"s\" in indication of the possessive  case. \"Cap'n Ant'ney Tom,\" \"Lloyd Bill,\" \"Aunt Rose Harry,\" means  \"Captain Anthony's Tom,\" \"Lloyd's Bill,\" &c. _\"Oo you dem long to?\"_  means, \"Whom do you belong to?\" _\"Oo dem got any peachy?\"_ means, \"Have  you got any peaches?\" I could scarcely understand them when I first went  among them, so broken was their speech; and I am persuaded that I could  not have been dropped anywhere on the globe, where I could reap less,  in the way of knowledge, from my immediate associates, than on this  plantation. Even \"MAS' DANIEL,\" by his association with his father's  slaves, had measurably adopted their dialect and their ideas, so far  as they had ideas to be adopted. The equality of nature is strongly  asserted in childhood, and childhood requires children for associates.  _Color_ makes no difference with a child. Are you a child with wants,  tastes and pursuits common to children, not put on, but natural? then,  were you black as ebony you would be welcome to the child of alabaster  whiteness. The law of compensation holds here, as well as elsewhere.  Mas' Daniel could not associate with ignorance without sharing its  shade; and he could not give his black playmates his company, without  giving them his intelligence, as well. Without knowing{60} this, or  caring about it, at the time, I, for some cause or other, spent much of  my time with Mas' Daniel, in preference to spending it with most of the  other boys.    Mas' Daniel was the youngest son of Col. Lloyd; his older brothers  were Edward and Murray--both grown up, and fine looking men. Edward was  especially esteemed by the children, and by me among the rest; not that  he ever said anything to us or for us, which could be called especially  kind; it was enough for us, that he never looked nor acted scornfully  toward us. There were also three sisters, all married; one to Edward  Winder; a second to Edward Nicholson; a third to Mr. Lownes.    The family of old master consisted of two sons, Andrew and Richard; his  daughter, Lucretia, and her newly married husband, Capt. Auld. This  was the house family. The kitchen family consisted of Aunt Katy, Aunt  Esther, and ten or a dozen children, most of them older than myself.  Capt. Anthony was not considered a rich slaveholder, but was pretty well  off in the world. He owned about thirty _\"head\"_ of slaves, and three  farms in Tuckahoe. The most valuable part of his property was his  slaves, of whom he could afford to sell one every year. This crop,  therefore, brought him seven or eight hundred dollars a year, besides  his yearly salary, and other revenue from his farms.    The idea of rank and station was rigidly maintained on Col. Lloyd's  plantation. Our family never visited the great house, and the Lloyds  never came to our home. Equal non-intercourse was observed between Capt.  Anthony's family and that of Mr. Sevier, the overseer.    Such, kind reader, was the community, and such the place, in which my  earliest and most lasting impressions of slavery, and of slave-life,  were received; of which impressions you will learn more in the coming  chapters of this book.          CHAPTER V. _Gradual Initiation to the Mysteries of Slavery_    GROWING ACQUAINTANCE WITH OLD MASTER--HIS CHARACTER--EVILS OF  UNRESTRAINED PASSION--APPARENT TENDERNESS--OLD MASTER A MAN OF  TROUBLE--CUSTOM OF MUTTERING TO HIMSELF--NECESSITY OF BEING AWARE OF  HIS WORDS--THE SUPPOSED OBTUSENESS OF SLAVE-CHILDREN--BRUTAL  OUTRAGE--DRUNKEN OVERSEER--SLAVEHOLDER'S IMPATIENCE--WISDOM OF APPEALING  TO SUPERIORS--THE SLAVEHOLDER S WRATH BAD AS THAT OF THE OVERSEER--A  BASE AND SELFISH ATTEMPT TO BREAK UP A COURTSHIP--A HARROWING SCENE.      Although my old master--Capt. Anthony--gave me at first, (as the reader  will have already seen) very little attention, and although that little  was of a remarkably mild and gentle description, a few months only were  sufficient to convince me that mildness and gentleness were not the  prevailing or governing traits of his character. These excellent  qualities were displayed only occasionally. He could, when it suited  him, appear to be literally insensible to the claims of humanity, when  appealed to by the helpless against an aggressor, and he could himself  commit outrages, deep, dark and nameless. Yet he was not by nature worse  than other men. Had he been brought up in a free state, surrounded by  the just restraints of free society--restraints which are necessary to  the freedom of all its members, alike and equally--Capt. Anthony might  have been as humane a man, and every way as respectable, as many who  now oppose the slave system; certainly as humane and respectable as are  members of society generally. The slaveholder, as well as the slave, is  the victim of the slave{62} system. A man's character greatly takes its  hue and shape from the form and color of things about him. Under the  whole heavens there is no relation more unfavorable to the development  of honorable character, than that sustained by the slaveholder to the  slave. Reason is imprisoned here, and passions run wild. Like the fires  of the prairie, once lighted, they are at the mercy of every wind, and  must burn, till they have consumed all that is combustible within their  remorseless grasp. Capt. Anthony could be kind, and, at times, he even  showed an affectionate disposition. Could the reader have seen him  gently leading me by the hand--as he sometimes did--patting me on the  head, speaking to me in soft, caressing tones and calling me his \"little  Indian boy,\" he would have deemed him a kind old man, and really,  almost fatherly. But the pleasant moods of a slaveholder are remarkably  brittle; they are easily snapped; they neither come often, nor remain  long. His temper is subjected to perpetual trials; but, since these  trials are never borne patiently, they add nothing to his natural stock  of patience.    Old master very early impressed me with the idea that he was an unhappy  man. Even to my child's eye, he wore a troubled, and at times, a haggard  aspect. His strange movements excited my curiosity, and awakened my  compassion. He seldom walked alone without muttering to himself; and he  occasionally stormed about,"]]]
