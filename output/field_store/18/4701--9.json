This magician asked for  Abe's hat to cook eggs in. Lincoln hesitated, but gave this explanation  for his delay: \"It was out of respect for the eggs--not care for my  hat!\"      ABE LINCOLN SAVES THREE LIVES    While they were at work on the flatboat the humorous young stranger from  Indiana became the hero of a thrilling adventure, described as follows  by John Roll, who was an eye witness to the whole scene:    \"It was the spring following 'the winter of the deep snow.' Walter  Carman, John Seamon, myself, and at times others of the Carman boys, had  helped Abe in building the boat, and when we had finished we went to  work to make a dug-out, or canoe, to be used as a small boat with the  flat. We found a suitable log about an eighth of a mile up the river,  and with our axes went to work under Lincoln's direction. The river was  very high, fairly 'booming.' After the dug-out was ready to launch we  took it to the edge of the water, and made ready to 'let her go,' when  Walter Carman and John Seamon jumped in as the boat struck the water,  each one anxious to be the first to get a ride. As they shot out from  the shore they found they were unable to make any headway against the  strong current. Carman had the paddle, and Seamon was in the stern of  the boat. Lincoln shouted to them to head up-stream and 'work back to  shore,' but they found themselves powerless against the stream. At last  they began to pull for the wreck of an old flatboat, the first ever  built on the Sangamon, which had sunk and gone to pieces, leaving one of  the stanchions sticking above the water. Just as they reached it Seamon  made a grab, and caught hold of the stanchion, when the canoe capsized,  leaving Seamon clinging to the old timber and throwing Carman into the  stream. It carried him down with the speed of a mill-race. Lincoln  raised his voice above the roar of the flood, and yelled to Carman to  swim for an elm tree which stood almost in the channel, which the action  of the water had changed.    \"Carman, being a good swimmer, succeeded in catching a branch, and  pulled himself up out of the water, which was very cold, and had almost  chilled him to death; and there he sat, shivering and chattering in the  tree.    \"Lincoln, seeing Carman safe, called out to Seamon to let go the  stanchion and swim for the tree. With some hesitation he obeyed, and  struck out, while Lincoln cheered and directed him from the bank. As  Seamon neared the tree he made one grab for a branch, and, missing it,  went under the water. Another desperate lunge was successful, and he  climbed up beside Carman.    \"Things were pretty exciting now, for there were two men in the tree,  and the boat gone. It was a cold, raw April day, and there was great  danger of the men becoming benumbed and falling back into the water.  Lincoln called out to them to keep their spirits up and he would save  them.    \"The village had been alarmed by this time, and many people had come  down to the bank. Lincoln procured a rope and tied it to a log. He  called all hands to come and help roll the log into the water, and,  after this had been done, he, with the assistance of several others,  towed it some distance up the stream. A daring young fellow by the name  of 'Jim' Dorell then took his seat on the end of the log, and it was  pushed out into the current, with the expectation that it would be  carried down stream against the tree where Seamon and Carman were.    \"The log was well directed, and went straight to the tree; but Jim, in  his impatience to help his friends, fell a victim to his good  intentions. Making a frantic grab at a branch, he raised himself off the  log, which was swept from under him by the raging waters and he soon  joined the other victims upon their forlorn perch.    \"The excitement on the shore increased, and almost the whole population  of the village gathered on the river bank. Lincoln had the log pulled up  the stream, and, securing another piece of rope, called to the men in  the tree to catch it if they could when he should reach the tree. He  then straddled the log himself, and gave the word to push out into the  stream. When he dashed into the tree he threw the rope over the stump of  a broken limb, and let it play until he broke the speed of the log, and  gradually drew it back to the tree, holding it there until the three now  nearly frozen men had climbed down and seated themselves astride. He  then gave orders to the people on shore to hold fast to the end of the  rope which was tied to the log, and leaving his rope in the tree he  turned the log adrift. The force of the current, acting against the taut  rope, swung the log around against the bank and all 'on board' were  saved.    \"The excited people who had watched the dangerous expedition with  alternate hope and fear, now broke into cheers for Abe Lincoln, and  praises for his brave act. This adventure made quite a hero of him along  the Sangamon, and the people never tired of telling of the exploit.\"      \"DOWN THE RIVER\"    The launching of that flatboat was made a feast-day in the neighborhood.  Denton Offutt, its proprietor, was invited to break away from the  \"Buckhorn\" tavern at Springfield to witness the ceremonies, which, of  course, took a political turn. There was much speech-making, but Andrew  Jackson and the Whig leaders were equally praised.    The boat had been loaded with pork in barrels, corn, and hogs, and it  slid into the Sangamon River, then overflowing with the spring \"fresh,\"  with a big splash.    The three sturdy navigators, accompanied by Offutt himself, floated away  in triumph from the waving crowd on the bank.    The first incident in the voyage occurred the 19th of April, at  Rutledge's mill dam at New Salem, where the boat stranded and \"hung\"  there a day and a night.      HOW ABE GOT THE FLATBOAT OVER THE DAM    New Salem was destined to fill an important place in the life of Abraham  Lincoln. One who became well acquainted with him described him as the  New Salemites first saw him, \"wading round on Rutledge's dam with his  trousers rolled up nine feet, more or less.\"    One of the crew gave this account of their mode of operations to get the  stranded raft over the dam:    \"We unloaded the boat--that is, we transferred the goods from our boat  to a borrowed one. We then rolled the barrels forward; Lincoln bored a  hole in the end (projecting) over the dam; the water which had leaked in  ran out then and we slid over.\"    Offutt's enthusiasm over Abe's simple method of surmounting this great  obstacle was boundless. A crowd had gathered on a hillside to watch  Lincoln's operations.      AN IMPROBABLE PROPHECY    For the novelty of the thing, John Hanks claimed to have taken young  Lincoln to a \"voodoo\" negress. She is said to have become excited in  reading the future of the tall, thin young man, saying to him, \"You will  be President, and all the negroes will be free.\" This story probably  originated long afterward, when the strange prophecy had already come  true--though fortune tellers often inform young men who come to them  that they will be Presidents some day. That such a woman could read the  Emancipation Proclamation in that young man's future is not at all  likely.    Another story is told of Abraham Lincoln's second visit to New Orleans  that is more probable, but even this is not certain to have happened  exactly as related. The young northerner doubtless saw negroes in  chains, and his spirit, like that of his father and mother, rebelled  against this inhumanity. There is little doubt that in such sights, as  one of his companions related, \"Slavery ran the iron into him then and  there.\"      \"I'LL HIT IT HARD!\"    But the story goes that the three young fellows--Hanks, Johnston and  Lincoln--went wandering about the city, and passed a slave market, where  a comely young mulatto girl was offered to the highest bidder. They saw  prospective purchasers examine the weeping girl's teeth, pinch her flesh  and pull her about as they would a cow or a horse. The whole scene was  so revolting that Lincoln recoiled from it with horror and hatred,  saying to his two companions, \"Boys, let's get away from this. If ever I  get a chance to hit that thing\"--meaning slavery--\"_I'll hit it hard_!\"    In June the four men took passage up the river on a steamboat for the  return trip. At St. Louis, Offutt got off to purchase stock for a store  he proposed to open in New Salem, where he planned to place young  Lincoln in charge.      WRESTLING WITH THE COUNTY CHAMPION    The other three started on foot to reach their several homes in  Illinois. Abe improved the opportunity to visit his father's family in  Coles County, where Thomas Lincoln had removed as soon as he was able  to leave their first Illinois home near Decatur.    Abe's reputation as a wrestler had preceded him and the Coles County  Champion, Daniel Needham, came and challenged the tall visitor to a  friendly contest. Young Lincoln laughingly accepted and threw Needham  twice. The crestfallen wrestler's pride was deeply hurt, and he found it  hard to give up beaten.    \"Lincoln,\" said he, \"you have thrown me twice, but you can't whip me.\"    Abe laughed again and replied:    \"Needham, are you satisfied that I can throw you? If you are not, and  must be convinced through a thrashing, I will do that, too--_for your  sake_!\"          CHAPTER X    CLERKING AND WORKING      HE COULD \"MAKE A FEW RABBIT TRACKS\"    It was in August, 1831, that Abraham Lincoln appeared in the village of  New Salem, Illinois. Neither Denton Offutt nor his merchandise had  arrived as promised. While paying the penalty of the punctual man--by  waiting for the tardy one--he seemed to the villagers to be loafing."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#12)"],[1,"and clear. It was a strangely beautiful thing,  this sight of three moons sailing aloft through the starry sky, as  though the beholder had been suddenly translated to some planet that  enjoys a plurality of satellites, but no living being could stand long  at gaze in that wind and that cold. A perfect paraselene is, I am  convinced, an extremely rare thing, much rarer than a perfect parhelion  (\"moon-cats\" my companion thought the phenomenon should be called,  saving the canine simile for the sun), for in seven years' travel I have  never seen another, and the references to it in literature are few.    The next day at noon, the sun not visible above the distant mountains,  there appeared in the sky a great shining cross of orange light, just  over the sun's position, that held and shone for nigh an hour and only  faded with the twilight. It is not surprising that these appearances  should deeply impress the untutored mind and should be deemed  significant and portentous; they must deeply impress any normal mind,  they are so grand and so strange. The man who has trained his intellect  until it is so stale, and starved his imagination until it is so  shrivelled that he can gaze unmoved at such spectacles, that they are  insignificant to him, has but reduced himself to the level of the dog  upon whom also they make no impression--though even a dog will howl at a  great aurora. Of course we know all about them; any schoolboy can pick  up a primer of physical geography and explain the laws of refraction,  and the ugly and most libellous diagram of circles and angles that shows  just how these lustrous splendours happen; but the mystery beyond is not  by one hair's breadth impaired nor their influence upon the spectator  diminished. In Alaska perhaps more than any other country it is the  heavens that declare the glory of God and the firmament that shows His  handiwork, and the awestruck Indian who comes with timid inquiry of the  import of such phenomena is rightfully and scientifically answered that  the Great Father is setting a sign in the sky that He still rules, that  His laws and commandments shall never lose their force, whether in the  heavens above or on the earth beneath.    [Sidenote: THE STRONG COLD]    The \"strong cold\" itself is an awe-inspiring thing even to those who  have been familiar with it all their lives; and a dweller in other  climes, endowed with any imagination, may without much difficulty enter  into the feelings of one who experiences it for the first time. It  descends upon the earth in the brief twilight and long darkness of the  dead of winter with an irresistible power and an inflexible menace.  Fifty below, sixty below, even seventy below, the thermometer reads.  Mercury is long since frozen solid and the alcohol grows sluggish. Land  and water are alike iron; utter stillness and silence usually reign.  Bare the hand, and in a few minutes the fingers will turn white and be  frozen to the bone. Stand still, and despite all clothing, all woollens,  all furs, the body will gradually become numb and death stalk upon the  scene. The strong cold brings fear with it. All devices to exclude it,  to conserve the vital heat seem feeble and futile to contend with its  terrible power. It seems to hold all living things in a crushing  relentless grasp, and to tighten and tighten the grip as the temperature  falls.    Yet the very power of it, and the dread that accompanies it, give a  certain fearful and romantic joy to the conquest of it. A man who has  endured it all day, who has endured it day after day, face to face with  it in the open, feels himself somewhat the more man for the experience,  feels himself entered the more fully into human possibilities and  powers, feels an exultation that manhood is stronger even than the  strong cold. But he is a fool if ever he grow to disdain the enemy. It  waits, inexorable, for just such disdain, and has slain many at last who  had long and often withstood it.    On those rare occasions when there is any wind, any movement of the air  at all, there enters another and a different feeling. Into the menace of  a power, irresistible, inflexible, but yet insentient, there seems to  enter a purposeful, vengeful evil. It pursues. The cold itself becomes  merely a condition; the wind a deadly weapon which uses that condition  to deprive its victim of all defence. The warmth which active exercise  stores up, the buckler of the traveller, is borne away. His reserves  are invaded, depleted, destroyed. And then the wind falls upon him with  its sword. Of all of which we were to have instance here on the Koyukuk.    [Sidenote: \"FOUND FROZEN\"]    In the second week of our stay at Bettles, while Divine service was in  progress in the store building, crowded with whites and natives, the  door opened and, with an inrush of cold air that condensed the moisture  at that end of the room into a cloud and shot along the floor like steam  from an engine exhaust, there entered an Indian covered with rime, his  whole head-gear one mass of white frost, his snow-shoes, just removed,  under his arm, and a beaded moose-skin wallet over his shoulder. Every  eye was at once turned to him as he beat the frost from his parkee hood  and thrust it back, unwrapped fold after fold of the ice-crusted scarf  from his face, and pulled off his mittens. Seeking out the agent, he  moved over to him and whispered something in his ear. It was plain that  the errand was of moment and the message disturbing, and as I had lost  the attention of the congregation and the continuity of my own  discourse, I drew things to a close as quickly as I decently could. That  Indian had come seventy-five miles on snow-shoes in one run, without  stopping at all save to eat two or three times, at a continuous  temperature of 50 deg. below zero or lower, to bring word that he had found  a white man frozen to death on the trail; and on the Koyukuk that feat  will always be counted to Albert the Pilot for righteousness. From the  location and description of the dead man, there was no difficulty in  identifying him. He was a wood-chopper under contract with the company  to cut one hundred cords of steamboat wood against next summer's  navigation at a spot about one hundred miles below Bettles. He had taken  down with him on the \"last water\" enough grub for about three months,  and was to return to Bettles for Christmas and for fresh supplies. After  a day or two's rest the Indian was sent back with instructions to bring  the body to a native village we should visit, to whipsaw lumber for a  coffin and dig a grave, and we engaged to give the body Christian  burial.    Uneasy at the softening muscles and sinews of this long inaction, I took  snow-shoes and a couple of Kobuks one day and made an ascent of the hill  behind Bettles known as Lookout Mountain, because from its top the smoke  of the eagerly expected first steamboat of the summer may be seen many  miles down the river; being moved to that particular excursion by  dispute among the weather-bound freighters as to the hill's height.    The change of temperature as we climbed the hill was striking. On the  first shoulder we were already out of the dense atmosphere of the valley  and above the smoke gloom of the houses, and as we rose the air grew  milder and milder, until at the top we emerged into the first sunshine  of many weeks and were in an altogether different climate--balmy and  grateful it was to us just come up from the strong cold. The aneroid  showed the altitude about seven hundred feet above Bettles, and I  regretted very much I had not brought the thermometer as well, for its  reading would have been most interesting.    The view from the top was brilliantly clear and far-reaching. The broad  plain across the river was checkered black and white with alternating  spruce thickets and lakes; beyond it and the mountains that bounded it  lay the valley of the south fork which we had crossed fifty or sixty  miles farther up on our journey hither. Right in front of us the middle  fork made its big bend from southwest to south, and to the left, that  is, to the north, the valley of the John River opened up its course  through the sharp white peaks of the Endicott Mountains. It was in this  direction that my eyes lingered longest. I knew that sixty or seventy  miles up this river we could cross the low Anaktuvak Pass into the  Anaktuvak River, which flows into the Colville, and that descending the  Colville we could reach the shores of the Northern Ocean. It was a  journey I had wished to make--and have wished ever since. There are many  bands of Esquimaux on that coast, never visited save by those who make  merchandise of them in one way or another. Please God, some day I should  get there; meanwhile our present hopes lay west, though, indeed, these  grew daily fainter.          CHAPTER III    BETTLES TO THE PACIFIC--THE ALATNA, KOBUK PORTAGE, KOBUK VILLAGE,  KOTZEBUE SOUND      ALL our preparations were long since made. Our Indian guide had been  sent back to Fort Yukon from Coldfoot, and here we engaged a young  Esquimau with his dog team and sled, to go across to Kotzebue Sound with  us. There was also a young Dane who wished to go from the Koyukuk  diggings to the diggings at Candle Creek on the Seward Peninsula, and  him we were willing to feed in return for his assistance on the trail.  The supplies had been carefully calculated for the journey, the  toboggans were already loaded, and we waited but a break in the cold  weather to start.    Our course from Bettles would lead us sixty-five miles farther down the  Koyukuk to the mouth of the Alatna. The visit to the native village and  the burial of the poor fellow frozen to death would take us ten miles  farther down than that, and we would return to the Alatna mouth. Then  the way would lie for fifty miles or so up that stream, and then over a  portage, across to the Kobuk River, which we"]]]
