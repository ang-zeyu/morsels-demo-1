[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21900"],[0,"The Principles of Breeding (#12)"],[1," of the organism of the  offspring\" are derived from the male, and certain other parts from the  female parent; and although no universal rule can be laid down upon  this point, yet the independent observations which have been made by  numerous practical breeders of domestic animals seem to establish that  such a _tendency_ has a real existence; the characters of the _animal_  portion of the fabric being especially (but not exclusively) derived  from the male parent, and those of the _organic_ apparatus being in  like manner derived from the female parent. The former will be chiefly  manifested in the external appearance, in the general configuration of  the head and limbs, in the organs of the senses (including the skin)  and in the locomotive apparatus; whilst the latter show themselves in  the size of the body (which is primarily determined by the development  of the viscera contained in the trunk) and in the mode in \"which the  vital functions are performed.\"    On the whole it may be said that the evidence both from observation  and the testimony of the best practical breeders goes to show that  each parent usually contributes certain portions of the organization  to the offspring, and that each has a modifying influence upon the  other. Facts also show that the same parent does not always contribute  the same portions, but that the order is reversed. Now, as no  operation of nature is by accident, but by virtue of _law_, there must  be fixed laws here, and there must also be, at times, certain  influences at work to modify the action of these laws. Where animals  are of distinct species, or of distinct breeds, transmission is  usually found to be in accordance with the rule above indicated, i.e.  the male gives mostly the outward form and locomotive system, and the  female chiefly the interior system, constitution, &c. Where the  parents are of the same breed, it appears that the portions  contributed by each are governed in large measure by the condition of  each in regard to age and vigor, or by virtue of individual potency or  superiority of physical endowment.    This _potency_ or power of transmission seems to be legitimately  connected with high breeding, or the concentration of fixed qualities  obtained by continued descent for many generations from such only as  possess in the highest degree the qualities desired. On the other hand  it must be admitted that there are exceptional cases not easily  accounted for upon any theory, and it seems not improbable that in  these the modifying influences may be such as to effect what may  approximate a reconstruction or new combination of the elements, in a  manner analogous to the chemical changes which we know take place in  the constituents of vegetables, as for instance, we find that sugar,  gum and starch, substances quite unlike in their appearance and uses,  are yet formed from the same elements and in nearly or precisely the  same proportions, by a chemistry which we have not yet fathomed.  Whether this supposition be correct or not, there is little doubt that  if we understood fully all the influences at work, and could estimate  fairly all the data to judge from, we might predict with confidence  what would be the characteristics of the progeny from any given union.    Practically, the knowledge obtained dictates in a most emphatic manner  that every stock-grower use his utmost endeavor to obtain the services  of the best sires; that is, _the best for the end and purposes in  view_--that he depend chiefly on the sire for outward form and  symmetry--that he select dams best calculated to develop the good  qualities of the male, depending chiefly upon these for freedom from  internal disease, for hardihood, constitution, and generally for all  qualities dependent upon the vital or nutritive system.    The neglect which is too common, and especially in breeding horses, to  the qualities of the dam, miserably old and inferior females being  often employed, cannot be too strongly censured. In rearing valuable  horses the dams are not of less consequence than the sires, although  their influence upon the progeny be not the same. This is well  understood and practiced upon by the Arab, who cultivates endurance  and bottom. If his mare be of the true Kochlani breed he will part  with her for no consideration whatever, while you can buy his stallion  at a comparatively moderate price. The prevalent practice in England  and America of cultivating speed in preference to other qualities, has  led us to attach greater importance to the male, and the too common  neglect of health, vigor, endurance and constitution in the mares has  in thousands of cases entailed the loss of qualities not less  valuable, and without which speed alone is of comparatively little  worth.    FOOTNOTES:    [17] In his work, \"De la Generation,\" Paris, 1828.    [18] Quoted, in part, from a paper by Alex. Harvey, M.D., read before  the Medical Society of Southampton, June 6th, 1854.          CHAPTER VI.    SEX.      With regard to the laws which regulate the sex of progeny very little  is known. Many and extensive observations have been made, but without  arriving at any definite conclusions. Nature seems to have provided  that the number of either sex produced, shall be nearly equal, but by  what means this result is attained, has not been discovered. Some  physiologists think the sex decided by the influence of the sire,  others think it due to the mother. Sir Everard Home believed the  _ovum_ or germ, previous to impregnation to be of no sex, but so  formed as to be equally fitted to become either male or female, and  that it is the process of impregnation which marks the sex and forms  the generative organs; that before the fourth month the sex cannot be  said to be confirmed, and that it will prove male or female as the  tendency to the paternal or maternal type may preponderate.    Mr. T.A. Knight[19] was of opinion that the sex of progeny depended  upon the influence of the female parent. He says, \"The female  parent's influence upon the sex of offspring in cows, and I have  reason to believe in the females of our other domestic animals, is so  strong, that it may, I think, be pronounced nearly positive,\" He also  says, \"I have repeatedly proved that by dividing a herd of thirty cows  into three equal parts, I could calculate with confidence upon a large  majority of females from one part, of males from another, and upon  nearly an equal number of males and females from the remainder. I have  frequently endeavored to change the habits by changing the male  without success.\" He relates a case as follows:--\"Two cows brought all  female offspring, one fourteen in fifteen years, and the other fifteen  in sixteen years, though I annually changed the bull. Both however  produced one male each, and that in the same year; and I confidently  expected, when the one produced a male that the other would, as she  did.\"    M. Giron, after long continued observation and experiment, stated with  much confidence, that the general law upon this point was, that the  sex of progeny would depend on the greater or less relative vigor of  the individuals coupled. In many experiments purposely made, he  obtained from ewes more males than females by coupling very strong  rams with ewes either too young, or too aged, or badly fed, and more  females than males by a reverse choice in the ewes and rams he put  together.    Mon. Martegoute, formerly Professor of Rural Economy, in a late  communication to the \"Journal D'Agriculture Pratique,\" says that as  the result of daily observations at a sheepfold of great importance,  that of the Dishley Mauchamp Merinos of M. Viallet at Blanc, he has,  if not deceived, obtained some new hints. He states that Giron's law  developed itself regularly at the sheepfold in all cases where  difference of vigor was observed in the ewes or rams which were  coupled; but he adds another fact, which he had observed every year  since 1853, when his observations began. This fact consists--    _First_, In that at the commencement of the rutting season when the  ram is in his full vigor he procreated more males than females.    _Second_, When, some days after, and the ewes coming in heat in great  numbers at once, the ram being weakened by a more frequent renewal of  the exertion, the procreation of females took the lead.    _Third_, The period of excessive exertion having passed, and the  number of ewes in heat being diminished, the ram also found less  weakened, the procreation of males in majority again commenced.\"    In order to show that the cause of such a result is isolated from all  other influences of a nature to be confounded with it, he gives the  details of his observations in a year when the number of births of  males and females were about equal. He also goes on to say, that, \"at  the end of each month all the animals at the sheepfold are weighed  separately, and thanks to these monthly weighings, we have drawn up  several tables from which are seen the diminution or increase in  weight of the different animals classed in various points of view,  whether according to age, sex or the object for which they were  intended.    Two of these tables have been appropriated to bearing ewes--one to  those which have borne and nursed males and the other to those which  have borne and brought up females. The abstract results of these two  tables have furnished two remarkable facts.    _First_, The ewes that have produced the female lambs are, on an  average, of a weight superior to those that produced the males; and  they evidently lose more in weight than these last during the suckling  period.    _Second_, The ewes that produce males weigh less, and do not lose in  nursing so much as the others.    If the indications given by these facts come to be confirmed by  experiments sufficiently repeated, two new laws will be placed by the  side of that which Giron de Bazareingues has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21916"],[0,"Villkor och möjligheter för kemisk storindustri i Sverige (#12)"],[1," |   fri       | 2954 | 3000 | 3740 | 1454 |  825 | 1431 |      |   fri       |283475|283630|343215|   38 |   -- |   -- |      |             |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |   fritt     |92250 |93488 |96503 |10898 |12042 |13694 |      |             |      |      |      |      |      |      |      +-------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+    I följande tabell angifves efter _Sveriges utförsel och införsel år  1906_ af Kgl.
