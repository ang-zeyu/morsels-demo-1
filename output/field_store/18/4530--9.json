The company in line or column of squads may be deployed in an oblique  direction by the same commands. The captain points out the desired  direction; the corporal of the base squad moves in the direction  indicated; the other corporals conform.    To form skirmish line to the flank or rear the line or the column of  squads is turned by squads to the flank or rear and then deployed as  described.    The intervals between men are increased or decreased as described in the  School of the Squad, adding to the preparatory command, guide right  (left or center), if necessary.        THE ASSEMBLY      The captain takes his post in front of, or designates, the element on  which the company is to assemble and commands: 1. Assemble, 2. MARCH.    If in skirmish line the men move promptly toward the designated point  and the company is re-formed in line. If assembled by platoons, these  are conducted to the designated point by platoon leaders, and the  company is reformed in line.    Platoons may be assembled by the command: 1. Platoons, assemble, 2.  MARCH.    Executed by each platoon as described for the company.    One or more platoons may be assembled by the command: 1. Such  platoon(s), assemble, 2. MARCH.    Executed by the designated platoon or platoons as described for the  company.    Wherever it is necessary in campaign to deploy troops there is often so  much noise and confusion that it is impossible for the officers and  noncommissioned officers to make themselves heard. Signals must be used  instead of verbal commands.        WHISTLE SIGNALS      There are only two kinds of whistle signals; a short last and a long  blast. A short blast means pay attention, or look out for a signal or  command.    A long blast means stop firing for a minute (suspend firing).        THE ADVANCE      The advance of a company into an engagement whether for attack or  defense) is conducted in close order, preferably column of squads, until  the probability of encountering hostile fire makes it advisable to  deploy. After deployment, and before opening fire, the advance of the  company may be continued in skirmish line or other suitable formations,  depending upon circumstances. The advance may often be facilitated, or  better advantage taken of cover, or losses reduced by the employment of  the platoon or squad columns or by the use of a succession of thin  lines. The selection of the method to be used is made by the captain or  major, the choice depending upon conditions arising during the progress  of the advance. If the deployment is found to be premature, it will  generally be best to assemble the company and proceed in close order.    Patrols are used to provide the necessary security against surprise.    Being in skirmish line: 1. Platoon columns, 2. MARCH.    [Illustration: SHOWING HOW PLATOON COLUMNS ARE FORMED]    The platoon leaders move forward through the center of their respective  platoons: men to the right of the platoon leader march to the left and  follow him in file; those to the left march in like manner to the right;  each platoon leader thus conducts the march of his platoon in double  column of files; platoon guides follow in the    [Illustration: SQUAD COLUMN]    rear of their respective platoons to insure prompt and orderly execution  of the advance.    [Illustration: SQUAD COLUMNS]    Being in skirmish line: 1. Squad columns, 2. MARCH. See preceding  page.    Each squad leader moves to the front; the members of each squad oblique  toward and follow their squad leader in single file at easy marching  distances.    Platoon columns are profitably used where the ground is so difficult  or cover is so limited as to make it desirable to take advantage of the  few favorable routes; no two platoons should march within the area of  burst of a single shrapnel (ordinarily about 20 yards wide). Squad  columns are of value principally in facilitating the advance over rough  or brush-grown ground; they afford no material advantage in securing  cover.    To deploy platoon or squad columns: 1. As skirmishers, 2. MARCH.    Skirmishers move to the right or left front and successively place  themselves in their original positions on the line.    [Illustration: PLATOON COLUMNS]    Being in platoon or squad columns: 1. Assemble, 2. MARCH.    The platoon or squad leaders signal assemble. The men of each platoon or  squad, as the case may be, advance and, moving to the right and left,  take their proper places in line, each unit assembling on the leading  element of the column and reforming in line. The platoon or squad  leaders conduct their units toward the element or point indicated by the  captain, and to their places in line; the company is reformed in line.    [Illustration: Assembled on the first or right squad.]    [Illustration]    Being in skirmish line, to advance by a succession of thin lines: 1.  (Such numbers), forward, 2. MARCH.    The captain points out in advance the selected position in front of the  line occupied. The designated number of each squad moves to the front;  the line thus formed preserves the original intervals as nearly as  practicable; when this line has advanced a suitable distance (generally  from 100 to 250 yards, depending upon the terrain and the character of  the hostile fire), a second is sent forward by similar commands, and so  on at irregular distances until the whole line has advanced. Upon  arriving at the indicated position, the first line is halted. Successive  lines, upon arriving, halt on line with the first and the men take their  proper places in the skirmish line.    The first line is led by the platoon leader of the right platoon, the  second by the guide of the right platoon, and so on in order from right  to left, by the officers and non-commissioned officers in the file  closers.    The advance is conducted in quick time unless conditions demand a faster  gait.    The company having arrived at the indicated position, a further advance  by the same means may be advisable.    The advance in a succession of thin lines is used to cross a wide  stretch swept, or likely to be swept, by artillery fire or heavy,  long-range rifle fire which cannot profitably be returned. Its purpose  is the building up a strong skirmish line preparatory to engaging in a  fire fight. This method of advancing results in serious (though  temporary) loss of control over the company. Its advantage lies in the  fact that it offers a less definite target, hence is less likely to draw  fire.    The above are suggestions. Other and better formations may be devised to  fit particular cases. The best formation is the one which advances the  line farthest with the least loss of men, time, and control.        FIELD EXERCISES      These exercises, as well as combat exercises, are for instruction in  duties incident to campaign. To receive the maximum benefit from them  you must know the assumed situation of each exercise.        THE FIRE ATTACK      The principles governing the advance of the firing line in attack are  considered in the chapters on Attack and Defense.    When it becomes impracticable for the company to advance as a whole by  ordinary means, it advances by rushes.    Being in skirmish line: 1. By platoon (two platoons, squad, four men,  etc.) from the right (left), 2. RUSH.    The platoon leader on the indicated flank carefully arranges the details  for a prompt and vigorous execution of the rush and puts it into effect  as soon as practicable. If necessary, he designates the leader for the  indicated fraction. When about to rush, he causes the men of the  fraction to cease firing and to hold themselves flat, but in readiness  to spring forward instantly. The leader of the rush (at the signal of  the platoon leader, if the latter be not the leader of the rush)  commands: Follow me, and running at top speed, leads the fraction to the  new line, where he halts it and causes it to open fire. The leader of  the rush selects the new line if it has not been previously designated.    The first fraction having established itself on the new line, the next  like fraction is sent forward by its platoon leader, without further  command of the captain, and so on, successively, until the entire  company is on the line established by the first rush.    If two or more platoons are ordered to rush, the senior platoon leader  takes charge of them, and the junior (or juniors) carries out the wishes  of the senior.    A part of the line having advanced, the captain may increase or decrease  the size of the fractions to complete the movement.    When the company forms a part of the firing line, the rush of the  company as a whole is conducted by the captain, as described for a  platoon in the preceding paragraph. The captain leads the rush; platoon  leaders lead their respective platoons, platoon guides follow the line  to insure prompt and orderly execution of the advance.    When the foregoing method of rushing, by running, becomes impracticable,  any method of advance that brings the attack closer to the enemy, such  as crawling, should be employed.    Quibbling over minor details shows a failure to grasp the big ideas.          CHAPTER VI    FIRE SUPERIORITY        Do not study this chapter until you begin your extended order drills.    If the authors of this text were requested to select for you the most  important of all information that you will receive during your  instruction at a training camp, they would advise you to take home that  contained in this chapter. If you have learned fully so much you will  have done well. If you have failed to comprehend as much as this, you  will have returned to your homes lacking in important knowledge.

The long-continued and carefully conducted experiment of Charles R.  Stockard at the Cornell Medical College is most widely quoted in this  connection. He works with guinea-pigs. The animals are intoxicated  daily, six days in the week, by inhaling the fumes of alcohol to the  point where they show evident signs of its influence; their condition  may thus be compared to that of the toper who never gets \"dead drunk\"  but is never entirely sober. Treatment of this sort for a period as long  as three years produces no apparent bad effect on the individuals; they  continue to grow and become fat and vigorous, taking plenty of food and  behaving in a normal manner in every particular. Some of them have been  killed from time to time, and all the tissues, including the  reproductive glands, have been found perfectly normal. \"The treated  animals are, therefore, little changed or injured so far as their  behavior and structure goes. Nevertheless, the effects of the treatment  are most decidedly indicated by the type of offspring to which they give  rise, whether they are mated together or with normal individuals.\"    Before the treatment is begun, every individual is mated at least once,  to demonstrate its possibility of giving rise to sound offspring. The  crucial test of the influence of alcohol on the germ-cells is, of  course, the mating of a previously alcoholized male with a normal,  untreated female, in a normal environment.    When the experiment was last reported,[16] it had covered five years and  four generations. The records of 682 offspring produced by 571 matings  were tabulated, 164 matings of alcoholized animals, in which either the  father, mother, or both were alcoholic, gave 64, or almost 40%, negative  results or early abortions, while only 25% of the control matings failed  to give full-term litters. Of the 100 full-term litters from alcoholic  parents 18% contained stillborn young and only 50% of all the matings  resulted in living litters, while 47% of the individuals in the litters  of living young died soon after birth. In contrast to this record 73% of  the 90 control matings gave living litters and 84% of the young in these  litters survived as normal, healthy animals.    \"The mating records of the descendants of the alcoholized guinea pigs,  although they themselves were not treated with alcohol, compare in some  respects even more unfavorably with the control records than do the  above data from the directly alcoholized animals.\" The records of the  matings in the second filial generation \"are still worse, higher  mortality and more pronounced deformities, while the few individuals  which have survived are generally weak and in many instances appear to  be quite sterile even though paired with vigorous, prolific, normal  mates.\"    We do not minimize the value of this experiment, when we say that too  much weight has been popularly placed on its results. Compare it with  the experiment with fowls at the University of Maine, which Raymond  Pearl reports.[17] He treated 19 fowls with alcohol, little effect on  the general health being shown, and none on egg production. From their  eggs 234 chicks were produced; the average percentage of fertility of  the eggs was diminished but the average percentage of hatchability of  fertile eggs was increased. The infant mortality of these chicks was  smaller than normal, the chicks were heavier when hatched and grew more  rapidly than normal afterwards. No deformities were found. \"Out of 12  different characters for which we have exact quantitative data, the  offspring of treated parents taken as a group are superior to the  offspring of untreated parents in 8 characters,\" in two characters they  are inferior and in the remaining two there is no discernible  difference. At this stage Dr. Pearl's experiment is admittedly too  small, but he is continuing it. As far as reported, it confirms the work  of Professor Nice, above mentioned, and shows that what is true for  guinea pigs may not be true for other animals, and that the amount of  dosage probably also makes a difference. Dr. Pearl explains his results  by the hypothesis that the alcohol eliminated the weaker germs in the  parents, and allowed only the stronger germs to be used for  reproduction.    Despite the unsatisfactory nature of much of the alleged evidence, we  must conclude that alcohol, when given in large enough doses, may  sometimes affect the germ-plasm of some lower animals in such a way as  to deteriorate the quality of their offspring. This effect is probably  an \"induction,\" which does not produce a permanent change in the bases  of heredity, but will wear away in a generation or two of good  surroundings. It must be remembered that although the second-generation  treated males of Dr. Stockard's experiment produced defective offspring  when mated with females from similarly treated stock, they produced  normal offspring when mated with normal females. The significance of  this fact has been too little emphasized in writings on \"racial  poisons.\" If a normal mate will counteract the influence of a \"poisoned\"  one, it is obvious that the probabilities of danger to any race from  this source are much decreased, while if only a small part of the race  is affected, and mates at random, the racial damage might be so small  that it could hardly be detected.    There are several possible explanations of the fact that injury is found  in some experiments but not in others. It may be, as Dr. Pearl thinks,  that only weak germs are killed by moderate treatment, and the strong  ones are uninjured. And it is probable (this applies more particularly  to man) that the body can take care of a certain amount of alcohol  without receiving any injury therefrom; it is only when the dosage  passes the \"danger point\" that the possibility of injury appears. As to  the location of this limit, which varies with the species, little is  known. Much more work is needed before the problem will be fully cleared  up.    Alcohol has been in use in parts of the world for many centuries; it was  common in the Orient before the beginning of historical knowledge. Now  if its use by man impairs the germ-plasm, then it seems obvious that the  child of one who uses alcohol to a degree sufficient to impair his  germ-plasm will tend to be born inferior to his parent. If that child  himself is alcoholic, his own offspring will suffer still more, since  they must carry the burden of two generations of impairment. Continuing  this line of reasoning over a number of generations, in a race where  alcohol is freely used by most of the population, one seems unable to  escape from the conclusion that the effects of this racial poison, if it  be such, must necessarily be cumulative. The damage done to the race  must increase in each generation. If the deterioration of the race could  be measured, it might even be found to grow in a series of figures  representing arithmetical progression.    It seems impossible, with such a state of affairs, that a race in which  alcohol was widely used for a long period of time, could avoid  extinction. At any rate, the races which have used alcohol longest ought  to show great degeneracy--unless there be some regenerative process at  work constantly counteracting this cumulative effect of the racial  poison in impairing the germ-plasm.    Such a proposition at once demands an appeal to history. What is found  in examination of the races that have used alcohol the longest? Have  they undergone a progressive physical degeneracy, as should be expected?    By no means. In this particular respect they seem to have become  stronger rather than weaker, as time went on; that is, they have been  less and less injured by alcohol in each century, as far as can be told.  Examination of the history of nations which are now comparatively sober,  although having access to unlimited quantities of alcohol, shows that at  an earlier period in their history, they were notoriously drunken; and  the sobriety of a race seems to be proportioned to the length of time in  which it has had experience of alcohol. The Mediterranean peoples, who  have had abundance of it from the earliest period recorded, are now  relatively temperate. One rarely sees a drunkard among them, although  many individuals in them would never think of drinking water or any  other non-alcoholic beverage. In the northern nations, where the  experience of alcohol has been less prolonged, there is still a good  deal of drunkenness, although not so much as formerly. But among nations  to whom strong alcohol has only recently been made available--the  American Indian, for instance, or the Eskimo--drunkenness is frequent  wherever the protecting arm of government does not interfere.    What bearing does this have on the theory of racial poisons?    Surely a consideration of the principle of natural selection will make  it clear that alcohol is acting as an instrument of racial purification  through the elimination of weak stocks. It is a drastic sort of  purification, which one can hardly view with complacency; but the  effect, nevertheless, seems clear cut.    To demonstrate the action of natural selection, we must first  demonstrate the existence of variations on which it can act. This is  not difficult in the character under consideration--namely, the greater  or less capacity of individuals to be attracted by alcohol, to an  injurious degree.    As G. Archdall Reid has pointed out,[18] men drink for at least three  different reasons: (1) to satisfy thirst."]]]
