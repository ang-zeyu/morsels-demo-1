The First Lord is clearly in favour of the Fleet going on  knocking the Forts to pieces whilst the Army are getting on with their  preparations; clearly also he thinks that, under rough handling from  Q.E. & Co., the Turkish resistance might at any moment collapse. Then we  should sail through as per Lord K.'s programme. Well; nothing would suit  me so well. If we are to have an opposed landing better kill two birds  with one stone and land bang upon the Bosphorus. The nearer to the heart  I can strike my first blow, the more telling it will be. Cable 140 puts  the case very well. Winston hits the nail on the head, so it seems to  me, when he points out that the Navy is not tied to the apron strings of  the Army but that it is the other way about: i.e., if the Fleet makes  another big push whilst we are getting ready, they can still fall back  on the combined show with us if they fail; whereas, if they succeed they  will save us all the loss of life and energy implied by an opposed  landing at the Dardanelles. Certainly Braithwaite and I had understood  that de Robeck would work to that end; that this is what he was driving  at when he said he would not be idle but would keep the Turks busy  whilst we were getting ready. Nothing will induce me to volunteer  opinions on Naval affairs. But de Robeck's reply to Winston might be  read as if I _had_ expressed an opinion, so I am bound to clear up that  point--definitely.      \"_From_ GENERAL SIR IAN HAMILTON.    \"_To_ VICE-ADMIRAL SIR JOHN DE ROBECK.    \"Copy of number 140 from Admiralty received AAA I had already  communicated outline of our plan to Lord Kitchener and am pushing on  preparations as fast as possible AAA War Office still seems to cherish  hope that you may break through without landing troops AAA Therefore, as  regards yourself I think wisest procedure will be to push on  systematically though not recklessly in attack on Forts AAA It is always  possible that opposition may crumple up AAA If you should succeed be  sure to leave light cruisers enough to see me through my military attack  in the event of that being after all necessary AAA If you do not succeed  then I think we quite understand one another AAA                                                         \"IAN HAMILTON.\"    _1st April, 1915. Alexandria._ The _Arcadian_ has arrived bringing my  A.G. and Q.M.G. with the second echelon of the Staff. God be praised for  this immense relief! The General Staff can now turn to their legitimate  business--the enemy, instead of struggling night and day with A.G. and  Q.M.G. affairs; allocating troops and transports; preparing for water  supply; tackling questions of procedure and discipline. We are all sorry  for the Q. Staff who, through no fault of their own, have been late for  the fair, _their_ special fair, the preparation, and find the show is  practically over. On paper at least, the Australians and New Zealanders  and the 29th Division are properly fixed up. We should begin embarking  these formations within the next three days. After that will come the  Naval Division from Port Said and the French Division from here.    _2nd April, 1915. Alexandria._ Hard at it all day in office. Am leaving  to-night by special train for Port Said to hurry things along.    A cable in from the Foreign Office telling me that the Russian part of  my force consists of a complete Army Corps under General  Istomine--evidently War and Foreign Offices still work in watertight  compartments!    Left Alexandria last night at 11 and came into Port Said at dawn. After  breakfast mounted an Arab charger which seems to have emerged out of the  desert to meet my wishes just as do special trains and banquets: as if I  wore on my finger the magic ring of the Arabian fairy tale: so I do I  suppose, in the command it has pleased K., Imperial Grand Vizier, to  bestow upon this humble but lively speck of dust. Mounting we cantered  through the heavy sand towards the parade ground near the docks. Here,  like a wall, stood Winston's far-famed Naval Division drawn up in its  battle array. General Paris received me backed by Olivant and Staff.  After my inspection the Division marched past, and marched past very  well indeed, much better than they did when I saw them some months ago  in Kent, although the sand was against them, muffling the stamp of feet  which binds a Company together and telling unevenly on different parts  of the line. Admiral Pierce and his Flag Captain, Burmeister, honoured  the occasion: they were on foot and so, not to elevate the stature of  the Army above that of the Senior Service, I took the salute dismounted.    Next had a look round camp. Found things so, so. Saw Arthur Asquith and  Rupert Brooke of the Howe Battalion, both sick, neither bad. Asked  Brooke to join my personal Staff, not as a fire insurance (seeing what  happened to Ronnie Brooke at Elandslaagte and to Ava at Waggon Hill) but  still as enabling me to keep an eye on the most distinguished of the  Georgians. Young Brooke replied, as a _preux chevalier_ would naturally  reply,--he realised the privileges he was foregoing, but he felt bound  to do the landing shoulder-to-shoulder with his comrades. He looked  extraordinarily handsome, quite a knightly presence, stretched out there  on the sand with the only world that counts at his feet.    Lunched on the _Franconia_ and conversed with Lieutenant-Colonel  Matthews and Major Mewes of the Plymouth Battalion; also with Major  Palmer. To see with your eyes; to hear with your ears; to touch with  your fingers enables you to bring the truth home to yourself. Five  minutes of that personal touch tells a man more than five weeks of  report reading. In five minutes I gained from these Officers five times  more knowledge about Sedd-el-Bahr and Kum Kale than all their own bald  despatches describing their own landings and cutting-out enterprises had  given me. Paris' account had not helped me much either, the reason being  that it was not first hand,--was only so many words that he had  heard,--was not what he had _felt_. Now, I do really, at last and for  the first time, realistically grasp the lie of the land and of the  Turks. The prospect is not too rosy, but Wolfe, I daresay, saw blue as  he gazed over the water at his problem, without map or General Staff  plan to help him. There lay Quebec; within cannon shot; but that enemy  was thrice his strength; entrenched in a fortress--there they lay  confident--a landing was \"impossible!\" But all things are possible--to  faith. He had faith in Pitt; faith in his own bright particular star;  faith in the British Fleet standing resolute at his back:--he launched  his attack; he got badly beaten at the landing; he pulled himself  together; he met a thousand and one mishaps and delays, and when, at the  long last, he fell, he had the plum in his pocket.    The Turks lie close within a few yards of the water's edge on the  Peninsula. Matthews smiled sarcastically at the War Office idea that no  Turks can exist South of Achi Baba! At Sedd-el-Bahr, the first houses  are empty, being open to the fire of the Fleet, but the best part of the  other houses are defiladed by the ground and a month ago they were held.  Glad I did not lose a minute after seeing the ground in asking Maxwell  and Methuen to make me some trench mortars. Methuen says he can't help,  but Maxwell's Ordnance people have already fixed up a sample or  two--rough things, but better than nothing. We have too little shrapnel  to be able to spare any for cutting entanglements. Trench mortars may  help where the Fleet can't bring their guns to bear. The thought of all  that barbed wire tucked away into the folds of the ground by the shore  follows me about like my shadow.    Left Port Said for Kantara and got there in half an hour. General Cox,  an old Indian friend of the days when I was A.D.C. to Sir Fred., met me  at the station. He commands the Indian troops in Egypt. We nipped into a  launch on the Canal, and crossed over to inspect the Companies of the  Nelson, Drake, Howe and Anson Battalions in their Fort, whilst Cox  hurried off to fix up a parade of his own.    The Indian Brigade were drawn up under Brigadier-General Mercer. After  inspection, the troops marched past headed by the band of the 14th  Sikhs. No one not a soldier can understand what it means to an old  soldier who began fighting in the Afghan War under Roberts of Kandahar  to be in touch once again with Sikhs and Gurkhas, those splendid  knights-errant of India.    After about eighteen years' silence, I thought my Hindustani would fail  me, but the words seemed to drop down from Heaven on to my tongue. Am  able now to understand the astonishment of St. Paul when he found  himself jabbering nineteen to the dozen in lingo, Greek to him till  then. But he at least was exempt from my worst terror which was that at  any moment I might burst into German!    After our little _durbar_, the men were dismissed to their lines and I  walked back to the Fort. There I suddenly ordered the alarm to be  sounded (I had not told anyone of my intention) so the swift yet smooth  fall-in to danger posts was a feather in Cox's helmet.    Back to main camp and there saw troops not manning the Fort. There were  the:--      Queen Victoria's Own      Sappers                Captain Hogg, R.E.,    69th Punjabis            Colonel Harding,    89th Punjabis            Colonel Campbell,    14th K.G.O. Sikhs        Colonel Palin,    1st Bn. 6th Gurkhas      Colonel Bruce,    29th Mountain Battery      and the Bikaner Camel      Corps                  Major Bruce.    Had a second good talk to the Native Officers, shaking hands all round.  Much struck with the turn-out of the 29th Mountain Battery which is to  come along with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps to the  Dardanelles.    From the platform of the Fort the lines of our"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19322"],[0,"The Antichrist (#12)"],[1,"of signs useful in speaking of it.    The _results_ of such a point of view project themselves into a new _way  of life_, the special evangelical way of life. It is not a \"belief\" that  marks off the Christian; he is distinguished by a different mode of  action; he acts _differently_. He offers no resistance, either by word  or in his heart, to those who stand against him. He draws no distinction  between strangers and countrymen, Jews and Gentiles (\"neighbour,\" of  course, means fellow-believer, Jew). He is angry with no one, and he  despises no one. He neither appeals to the courts of justice nor heeds  their mandates (\"Swear not at all\").[12] He never under any  circumstances divorces his wife, even when he has proofs of her  infidelity.--And under all of this is one principle; all of it arises  from one instinct.--    [12] Matthew v, 34.    The life of the Saviour was simply a carrying out of this way of  life--and so was his death.... He no longer needed any formula or ritual  in his relations with God--not even prayer. He had rejected the whole of  the Jewish doctrine of repentance and atonement; he _knew_ that it was  only by a _way_ of life that one could feel one's self \"divine,\"  \"blessed,\" \"evangelical,\" a \"child of God.\" _Not_ by \"repentance,\" _not_  by \"prayer and forgiveness\" is the way to God: _only the Gospel way_  leads to God--it is _itself_ \"God!\"--What the Gospels _abolished_ was  the Judaism in the concepts of \"sin,\" \"forgiveness of sin,\" \"faith,\"  \"salvation through faith\"--the whole _ecclesiastical_ dogma of the Jews  was denied by the \"glad tidings.\"    The deep instinct which prompts the Christian how to _live_ so that he  will feel that he is \"in heaven\" and is \"immortal,\" despite many reasons  for feeling that he is _not_ \"in heaven\": this is the only psychological  reality in \"salvation.\"--A new way of life, _not_ a new faith....      34.    If I understand anything at all about this great symbolist, it is this:  that he regarded only _subjective_ realities as realities, as  \"truths\"--that he saw everything else, everything natural, temporal,  spatial and historical, merely as signs, as materials for parables. The  concept of \"the Son of God\" does not connote a concrete person in  history, an isolated and definite individual, but an \"eternal\" fact, a  psychological symbol set free from the concept of time. The same thing  is true, and in the highest sense, of the _God_ of this typical  symbolist, of the \"kingdom of God,\" and of the \"sonship of God.\" Nothing  could be more un-Christian than the _crude ecclesiastical_ notions of  God as a _person_, of a \"kingdom of God\" that is to come, of a \"kingdom  of heaven\" beyond, and of a \"son of God\" as the _second person_ of the  Trinity. All this--if I may be forgiven the phrase--is like thrusting  one's fist into the eye (and what an eye!) of the Gospels: a disrespect  for symbols amounting to _world-historical cynicism_.... But it is  nevertheless obvious enough what is meant by the symbols \"Father\" and  \"Son\"--not, of course, to every one--: the word \"Son\" expresses  _entrance_ into the feeling that there is a general transformation of  all things (beatitude), and \"Father\" expresses _that feeling  itself_--the sensation of eternity and of perfection.--I am ashamed to  remind you of what the church has made of this symbolism: has it not set  an Amphitryon story[13] at the threshold of the Christian \"faith\"? And a  dogma of \"immaculate conception\" for good measure?... _And thereby it  has robbed conception of its immaculateness_--    [13] Amphitryon was the son of Alcaeus, King of Tiryns.  His wife was Alcmene. During his absence she was visited by Zeus, and  bore Heracles.    The \"kingdom of heaven\" is a state of the heart--not something to come  \"beyond the world\" or \"after death.\" The whole idea of natural death is  _absent_ from the Gospels: death is not a bridge, not a passing; it is  absent because it belongs to a quite different, a merely apparent world,  useful only as a symbol. The \"hour of death\" is _not_ a Christian  idea--\"hours,\" time, the physical life and its crises have no existence  for the bearer of \"glad tidings.\"... The \"kingdom of God\" is not  something that men wait for: it had no yesterday and no day after  tomorrow, it is not going to come at a \"millennium\"--it is an experience  of the heart, it is everywhere and it is nowhere....      35.    This \"bearer of glad tidings\" died as he lived and _taught_--_not_ to  \"save mankind,\" but to show mankind how to live. It was a _way of life_  that he bequeathed to man: his demeanour before the judges, before the  officers, before his accusers--his demeanour on the _cross_. He does not  resist; he does not defend his rights; he makes no effort to ward off  the most extreme penalty--more, _he invites it_.... And he prays,  suffers and loves _with_ those, _in_ those, who do him evil.... _Not_ to  defend one's self, _not_ to show anger, _not_ to lay blames.... On the  contrary, to submit even to the Evil One--to _love_ him....      36.    --We free spirits--we are the first to have the necessary prerequisite  to understanding what nineteen centuries have misunderstood--that  instinct and passion for integrity which makes war upon the \"holy lie\"  even more than upon all other lies.... Mankind was unspeakably far from  our benevolent and cautious neutrality, from that discipline of the  spirit which alone makes possible the solution of such strange and  subtle things: what men always sought, with shameless egoism, was their  _own_ advantage therein; they created the _church_ out of denial of the  Gospels....    Whoever sought for signs of an ironical divinity's hand in the great  drama of existence would find no small indication thereof in the  _stupendous question-mark_ that is called Christianity. That mankind  should be on its knees before the very antithesis of what was the  origin, the meaning and the _law_ of the Gospels--that in the concept of  the \"church\" the very things should be pronounced holy that the \"bearer  of glad tidings\" regards as _beneath_ him and _behind_ him--it would be  impossible to surpass this as a grand example of _world-historical  irony_--      37.    --Our age is proud of its historical sense: how, then, could it delude  itself into believing that the _crude fable of the wonder-worker and  Saviour_ constituted the beginnings of Christianity--and that everything  spiritual and symbolical in it only came later? Quite to the contrary,  the whole history of Christianity--from the death on the cross  onward--is the history of a progressively clumsier misunderstanding of  an _original_ symbolism. With every extension of Christianity among  larger and ruder masses, even less capable of grasping the principles  that gave birth to it, the need arose to make it more and more _vulgar_  and _barbarous_--it absorbed the teachings and rites of all the  _subterranean_ cults of the _imperium Romanum_, and the absurdities  engendered by all sorts of sickly reasoning. It was the fate of  Christianity that its faith had to become as sickly, as low and as  vulgar as the needs were sickly, low and vulgar to which it had to  administer. A _sickly barbarism_ finally lifts itself to power as the  church--the church, that incarnation of deadly hostility to all honesty,  to all loftiness of soul, to all discipline of the spirit, to all  spontaneous and kindly humanity.--_Christian_ values--_noble_ values: it  is only we, we _free_ spirits, who have re-established this greatest of  all antitheses in values!...      38.    --I cannot, at this place, avoid a sigh. There are days when I am  visited by a feeling blacker than the blackest melancholy--_contempt of  man_. Let me leave no doubt as to _what_ I despise, _whom_ I despise:  it is the man of today, the man with whom I am unhappily  contemporaneous. The man of today--I am suffocated by his foul  breath!... Toward the past, like all who understand, I am full of  tolerance, which is to say, _generous_ self-control: with gloomy caution  I pass through whole millenniums of this madhouse of a world, call it  \"Christianity,\" \"Christian faith\" or the \"Christian church,\" as you  will--I take care not to hold mankind responsible for its lunacies. But  my feeling changes and breaks out irresistibly the moment I enter modern  times, _our_ times. Our age _knows better_.... What was formerly merely  sickly now becomes indecent--it is indecent to be a Christian today.  _And here my disgust begins._--I look about me: not a word survives of  what was once called \"truth\"; we can no longer bear to hear a priest  pronounce the word. Even a man who makes the most modest pretensions to  integrity _must_ know that a theologian, a priest, a pope of today not  only errs when he speaks, but actually _lies_--and that he no longer  escapes blame for his lie through \"innocence\" or \"ignorance.\" The priest  knows, as every one knows, that there is no longer any \"God,\" or any  \"sinner,\" or any \"Saviour\"--that \"free will\" and the \"moral order of the  world\" are lies--: serious reflection, the profound self-conquest of the  spirit, _allow_ no man to pretend that he does _not_ know it.... _All_  the ideas of the church are now recognized for what they are--as the  worst counterfeits in existence, invented to debase nature and all  natural values; the priest himself is seen as he actually is--as the  most dangerous form of parasite, as the venomous spider of creation....  We know, our _conscience_ now knows--just _what_ the real value of all  those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and _what ends  they have served_, with their debasement of humanity to a state of  self-pollution, the very sight of which excites loathing,--the concepts  \"the other world,\" \"the last judgment,\" \"the immortality of the soul,\"  the \"soul\" itself: they are all merely so many instruments of torture,  systems of cruelty, whereby the priest becomes master and"]]]
