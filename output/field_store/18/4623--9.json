THE LONE BUFFALO HUNTER        It's of those Texas cowboys, a story I'll tell;    No name I will mention though in Texas they do dwell.    Go find them where you will, they are all so very brave,    And when in good society they seldom misbehave.      When the fall work is all over in the line-camp they'll be found,    For they have to ride those lonesome lines the long winter round;    They prove loyal to a comrade, no matter what's to do;    And when in love with a fair one they seldom prove untrue.      But springtime comes at last and finds them glad and gay;    They ride out to the round-up about the first of May;    About the first of August they start up the trail,    They have to stay with the cattle, no matter rain or hail.      But when they get to the shipping point, then they receive their tens,    Straightway to the bar-room and gently blow them in;    It's the height of their ambition, so I've been truly told,    To ride good horses and saddles and spend the silver and gold.      Those last two things I've mentioned, it is their heart's desire,    And when they leave the shipping point, their eyes are like balls        of fire.    It's of those fighting cattle, they seem to have no fear,    A-riding bucking broncos oft is their heart's desire.      They will ride into the branding pen, a rope within their hands,    They will catch them by each forefoot and bring them to the sands;    It's altogether in practice with a little bit of sleight,    A-roping Texas cattle, it is their heart's delight.      But now comes the rising generation to take the cowboy's place,    Likewise the corn-fed granger, with his bold and cheeky face;    It's on those plains of Texas a lone buffalo hunter does stand    To tell the fate of the cowboy that rode at his right hand.          THE CROOKED TRAIL TO HOLBROOK        Come all you jolly cowboys that follow the bronco steer,    I'll sing to you a verse or two your spirits for to cheer;    It's all about a trip, a trip that I did undergo    On that crooked trail to Holbrook, in Arizona oh.      It's on the seventeenth of February, our herd it started out,    It would have made your hearts shudder to hear them bawl and shout,    As wild as any buffalo that ever rode the Platte,    Those dogies we were driving, and every one was fat.      We crossed the Mescal Mountains on the way to Gilson Flats,    And when we got to Gilson Flats, Lord, how the wind did blow;    It blew so hard, it blew so fierce, we knew not where to go,    But our spirits never failed us as onward we did go,--    On that crooked trail to Holbrook, in Arizona oh.      That night we had a stampede; Christ, how the cattle run!    We made it to our horses; I tell you, we had no fun;    Over the prickly pear and catclaw brush we quickly made our way;    We thought of our long journey and the girls we'd left one day.      It's long by Sombserva we slowly punched along,    While each and every puncher would sing a hearty song    To cheer up his comrade as onward we did go,    On that crooked trail to Holbrook, in Arizona oh.      We crossed the Mongollen Mountains where the tall pines do grow,    Grass grows in abundance, and rippling streams do flow;    Our packs were always turning, of course our gait was slow,    On that crooked trail to Holbrook, in Arizona oh.      At last we got to Holbrook, a little gale did blow;    It blew up sand and pebble stones and it didn't blow them slow.    We had to drink the water from that muddy little stream    And swallowed a peck of dirt when we tried to eat a bean.      But the cattle now are shipped and homeward we are bound    With a lot of as tired horses as ever could be found;    Across the reservation no danger did we fear,    But thought of wives and sweethearts and the ones we love so dear.    Now we are back in Globe City, our friendship there to share;    Here's luck to every puncher that follows the bronco steer.          ONLY A COWBOY        Away out in old Texas, that great lone star state,    Where the mocking bird whistles both early and late;    It was in Western Texas on the old N A range    The boy fell a victim on the old staked plains.        He was only a cowboy gone on before,      He was only a cowboy, we will never see more;      He was doing his duty on the old N A range      But now he is sleeping on the old staked plains.      His crew they were numbered twenty-seven or eight,    The boys were like brothers, their friendship was great,    When \"O God, have mercy\" was heard from behind,--    The cattle were left to drift on the line.      He leaves a dear wife and little ones, too,    To earn them a living, as fathers oft do;    For while he was working for the loved ones so dear    He was took without warning or one word of cheer.      And while he is sleeping where the sun always shines,    The boys they go dashing along on the line;    The look on their faces it speaks to us all    Of one who departed to the home of the soul.      He was only a cowboy gone on before,    He was only a cowboy, we will never see more;    He was doing his duty on the old N A range    But now he is sleeping on the old staked plains.          FULLER AND WARREN        Ye sons of Columbia, your attention I do crave,    While a sorrowful story I do tell,    Which happened of late, in the Indiana state,    And a hero not many could excel;    Like Samson he courted, made choice of the fair,    And intended to make her his wife;    But she, like Delilah, his heart did ensnare,    Which cost him his honor and his life.      A gold ring he gave her in token of his love,    On the face was the image of the dove;    They mutually agreed to get married with speed    And were promised by the powers above.    But the fickle-minded maiden vowed again to wed    To young Warren who lived in that place;    It was a fatal blow that caused his overthrow    And added to her shame and disgrace.      When Fuller came to hear he was deprived of his dear    Whom he vowed by the powers to wed,    With his heart full of woe unto Warren he did go,    And smilingly unto him he said:    \"Young man, you have injured me to gratify your cause    By reporting that I left a prudent wife;    Acknowledge now that you have wronged me, for although        I break the laws,    Young Warren, I'll deprive you of your life.\"      Then Warren, he replied: \"Your request must be denied,    For your darling to my heart she is bound;    And further I can say that this is our wedding day,    In spite of all the heroes in town.\"    Then Fuller in the passion of his love and anger bound,--    Alas! it caused many to cry,--    At one fatal shot killed Warren on the spot,    And smilingly said, \"I'm ready now to die.\"      The time was drawing nigh when Fuller had to die;    He bid the audience adieu.    Like an angel he did stand, for he was a handsome man,    On his breast he had a ribbon of blue.    Ten thousand spectators did smite him on the breast,    And the guards dropped a tear from the eye,    Saying, \"Cursed be she who caused this misery,    Would to God in his stead she had to die.\"      The gentle god of Love looked with anger from above    And the rope flew asunder like the sand.    Two doctors for the pay they murdered him, they say,    They hung him by main strength of hand.    But the corpse it was buried and the doctors lost their prey,    Oh, that harlot was bribed, I do believe;    Bad women to a certainty are the downfall of men,    As Adam was beguiled by Eve.          Fuller and Warren (Mus. Not.)        Ye sons of Co-lum-bia, your at-ten-tion I do crave,    While a sor-ri-ful sto-ry I do tell,    Which hap-pened of late in the In-di-an-a state,    And a he-ro ... not ma-ny could ex-cel.    Like Sam-son he court-ed, made choice of the fair,    And in-tend-ed ... to make her his wife;    But she, like De-li-la,... his heart did en-snare,    Which cost him his hon-or and his life.          THE TRAIL TO MEXICO        I made up my mind to change my way    And quit my crowd that was so gay,    To leave my native home for a while    And to travel west for many a mile.      Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.      'Twas all in the merry month of May    When I started for Texas far away,    I left my darling girl behind,--    She said her heart was only mine.      Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.      Oh, it was when I embraced her in my arms    I thought she had ten thousand charms;    Her caresses were soft, her kisses were sweet,    Saying, \"We will get married next time we meet.\"      Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.      It was in the year of eighty-three    That A.J. Stinson hired me.    He says, \"Young fellow, I want you to go    And drive this herd to Mexico.\"      Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.      The first horse they gave me was an old black    With two big set-fasts on his back;    I padded him with gunny-sacks and my bedding all;    He went up, then down, and I got a fall.      Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.      The next they gave me was an old gray,    I'll remember him till my dying day.    And if I had to swear to the fact,    I believe he was worse off than the black.      Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.      Oh, it was early in the year    When I went on trail to drive the steer.    I stood my guard through sleet and snow    While on the trail to Mexico.      Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.      Oh, it was a long and lonesome go    As our herd rolled on to Mexico;    With laughter light and the cowboy's song    To Mexico we rolled along.      Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.      When I arrived in Mexico    I wanted to see my love but could not go;    So I wrote a letter, a letter to my dear,    But not a word from her could I hear.      Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.      When I arrived at the once loved home    I called for the darling of my own;    They said she had married a richer life,    Therefore, wild cowboy, seek another wife.      Whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo-a-whoo.      Oh, the girl she is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2131"],[0,"An Account of Egypt (#12)"],[1,"had remembrance of the Egyptians more than the  Egyptians of the Colchians; but the Egyptians said they believed that  the Colchians were a portion of the army of Sesostris. That this was  so I conjectured myself not only because they are dark-skinned and have  curly hair (this of itself amounts to nothing, for there are other races  which are so), but also still more because the Colchians, Egyptians,  and Ethiopians alone of all the races of men have practised circumcision  from the first. The Phenicians and the Syrians who dwell in Palestine  confess themselves that they have learnt it from the Egyptians, and  the Syrians about the river Thermodon and the river Parthenios, and the  Macronians, who are their neighbors, say that they have learnt it  lately from the Colchians. These are the only races of men who practise  circumcision, and these evidently practise it in the same manner as the  Egyptians. Of the Egyptians themselves however and the Ethiopians, I  am not able to say which learnt from the other, for undoubtedly it is a  most ancient custom; but that the other nations learnt it by intercourse  with the Egyptians, this among others is to me a strong proof, namely  that those of the Phenicians who have intercourse with Hellas cease  to follow the example of the Egyptians in this matter, and do not  circumcise their children. Now let me tell another thing about the  Colchians to show how they resemble the Egyptians:--they alone work flax  in the same fashion as the Egyptians, and the two nations are like one  another in their whole manner of living and also in their language: now  the linen of Colchis is called by the Hellenes Sardonic, whereas that  from Egypt is called Egyptian. The pillars which Sesostris king of Egypt  set up in the various countries are for the most part no longer to be  seen extant; but in Syria Palestine I myself saw them existing with the  inscription upon them which I have mentioned and the emblem. Moreover  in Ionia there are two figures of this man carved upon rocks, one on  the road by which one goes from the land of Ephesos to Phocaia, and the  other on the road from Sardis to Smyrna. In each place there is a figure  of a man cut in the rock, of four cubits and a span in height, holding  in his right hand a spear and in his left a bow and arrows, and the  other equipment which he has is similar to this, for it is both Egyptian  and Ethiopian: and from the one shoulder to the other across the breast  runs an inscription carved in sacred Egyptian characters, saying thus,  \"This land with my shoulders I won for myself.\" But who he is and from  whence, he does not declare in these places, though in other places he  had declared this. Some of those who have seen these carvings conjecture  that the figure is that of Memnon, but herein they are very far from the  truth.    As this Egyptian Sesostris was returning and bringing back many men of  the nations whose lands he had subdued, when he came (said the priests)  to Daphnai in the district of Pelusion on his journey home, his brother  to whom Sesostris had entrusted the charge of Egypt invited him and  with him his sons to a feast; and then he piled the house round with  brushwood and set it on fire: and Sesostris when he discovered this  forthwith took counsel with his wife, for he was bringing with him (they  said) his wife also; and she counselled him to lay out upon the pyre two  of his sons, which were six in number, and so to make a bridge over  the burning mass, and that they passing over their bodies should thus  escape. This, they said, Sesostris did, and two of his sons were burnt  to death in this manner, but the rest got away safe with their father.  Then Sesostris, having returned to Egypt and having taken vengeance on  his brother employed the multitude which he had brought in of those  whose lands he had subdued, as follows:--these were they who drew the  stones which in the reign of this king were brought to the temple of  Hephaistos, being of very good size; and also these were compelled to  dig all the channels which now are in Egypt; and thus (having no such  purpose) they caused Egypt, which before was all fit for riding and  driving, to be no longer fit for this from thenceforth: for from that  time forward Egypt, though it is plain land, has become all unfit for  riding and driving, and the cause has been these channels, which are  many and run in all directions. But the reason why the king cut up  the land was this, namely because those of the Egyptians who had their  cities not on the river but in the middle of the country, being in want  of water when the river went down from them, found their drink brackish  because they had it from wells. For this reason Egypt was cut up: and  they said that this king distributed the land to all the Egyptians,  giving an equal square portion to each man, and from this he made his  revenue, having appointed them to pay a certain rent every year: and  if the river should take away anything from any man's portion, he would  come to the king and declare that which had happened, and the king used  to send men to examine and to find out by measurement how much less the  piece of land had become, in order that for the future the man might pay  less, in proportion to the rent appointed: and I think that thus the art  of geometry was found out and afterwards came into Hellas also. For as  touching the sun-dial and the gnomon and the twelve divisions of the  day, they were learnt by the Hellenes from the Babylonians. He moreover  alone of all the Egyptian kings had rule over Ethiopia; and he left  as memorials of himself in front of the temple of Hephaistos two stone  statues of thirty cubits each, representing himself and his wife,  and others of twenty cubits each representing his four sons: and long  afterwards the priest of Hephaistos refused to permit Dareios the  Persian to set up a statue of himself in front of them, saying that  deeds had not been done by him equal to those which were done by  Sesostris the Egyptian; for Sesostris had subdued other nations besides,  not fewer than he, and also the Scythians; but Dareios had not been able  to conquer the Scythians: wherefore it was not just that he should set  up a statue in front of those which Sesostris had dedicated, if he did  not surpass him in his deeds. Which speech, they say, Dareios took in  good part.    Now after Sesostris had brought his life to an end, his son Pheros,  they told me, received in succession the kingdom, and he made no warlike  expedition, and moreover it chanced to him to become blind by reason of  the following accident:--when the river had come down in flood rising to  a height of eighteen cubits, higher than ever before that time, and had  gone over the fields, a wind fell upon it and the river became agitated  by waves: and this king (they say) moved by presumptuous folly took  a spear and cast it into the midst of the eddies of the stream; and  immediately upon this he had a disease of the eyes and was by it made  blind. For ten years then he was blind, and in the eleventh year there  came to him an oracle from the city of Buto saying that the time of his  punishment had expired, and that he should see again if he washed his  eyes with the water of a woman who had accompanied with her own husband  only and had not had knowledge of other men: and first he made trial of  his own wife, and then, as he continued blind, he went on to try all the  women in turn; and when he had at least regained his sight he gathered  together all the women of whom he had made trial, excepting her by  whose means he had regained his sight, to one city which now is named  Erythrabolos, and having gathered them to this he consumed them all by  fire, as well as the city itself; but as for her by whose means he  had regained his sight, he had her himself to wife. Then after he had  escaped the malady of his eyes he dedicated offerings at each one of the  temples which were of renown, and especially (to mention only that which  is most worthy of mention) he dedicated at the temple of the Sun works  which are worth seeing, namely two obelisks of stone, each of a single  block, measuring in length a hundred cubits each one and in breadth  eight cubits.    After him, they said, there succeeded to the throne a man of Memphis,  whose name in the tongue of the Hellenes was Proteus; for whom there is  now a sacred enclosure at Memphis, very fair and well ordered, lying on  that side of the temple of Hephaistos which faces the North Wind. Round  about this enclosure dwell Phenicians of Tyre, and this whole region is  called the Camp of the Tyrians. Within the enclosure of Proteus there  is a temple called the temple of the \"foreign Aphrodite,\" which temple  I conjecture to be one of Helen the daughter of Tyndareus, not only  because I have heard the tale how Helen dwelt with Proteus, but also  especially because it is called by the name of the \"foreign Aphrodite,\"  for the other temples of Aphrodite which there are have none of them the  addition of the word \"foreign\" to the name.    And the priests told me, when I inquired, that the things concerning  Helen happened thus:--Alexander having carried off Helen was sailing  away from Sparta to his own land, and when he had come to the Egean Sea  contrary winds drove him from his course to the Sea of Egypt; and after  that, since the blasts did not cease to blow, he came to Egypt itself,  and in Egypt to that which is now named the Canobic mouth of the Nile  and to Taricheiai. Now there was upon the shore, as still there is now,  a temple of Heracles, in which if any man's slave take refuge and have  the sacred marks set upon him, giving himself over to the god, it is  not lawful to lay hands upon him; but this custom has continued still  unchanged from the beginning down to my own time. Accordingly the  attendants of Alexander, having heard of the custom which"]]]
