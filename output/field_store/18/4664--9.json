Herein are discerned the  elements of decadence, which are wont to assume precisely this aspect of a  mastery over difficulties. For such ends genuine research and the true  grasp of form were gradually abandoned.    Calligraphy and the literary style were not overlooked, but they were  carried to a point of abstraction that is beyond the province of art. A  personage was represented by lines which formed characters in handwriting  and which, in drawing the figure, at the same time wrote a sentence.  Doubtless that is a proof of marvelous skill. I agree in assigning such  masterpieces to the realm of calligraphy but refuse to admit them to the  domain of painting.    This applies as well to the so-called _thumb nail painting_ held in high  repute under the last dynasty. In this the brush is abandoned and the line  is drawn by the finger dipped in ink or color. The painting is done on  modern paper of a special kind which partially absorbs the paint, in the  manner of blotting paper; this results in weak lines, and ink and color  schemes devoid of firmness, in short, in a lack of virility which places  such works, notwithstanding their virtuosity, in the category of artisan  achievements. These works are numerous in the modern period and constitute  what so many regard as Chinese painting. One cannot be too careful in  discarding them.    During every period decorative paintings, religious paintings and  ancestral paintings made after death, were executed in China by artisans,  ordinary workmen at the service of whosoever might engage them. Such work  should not be consulted in studying the styles of great periods or the  higher manifestations of an art. These paintings were the first to leave  China and find their way to Europe. There is no reason for analyzing them  here.    To sum up, Chinese painting of the last two centuries still numbers  masters of the first rank. This alone indicates that the sacred fire is by  no means extinct. Who shall say what future awaits it amidst the  profound changes of today? After a period of indecision which lasted for  twenty-five years, Japan has found herself anew and is seeking to revive  her artistic traditions. It is to be hoped that China will, at all costs,  avoid the same mistakes and that she will not be unmindful, as was her  neighbor, of the history of the old masters.      [Illustration: PLATE XXIII. HALT OF THE IMPERIAL HUNT    Ming Period. Sixteenth Century. Collection of R. Petrucci.]             *       *       *       *       *      CONCLUSION      This brief survey has shown how the distinctive features of China's  artistic activity were distributed. Though subjected to varying  influences, this evolution possesses a unity which is quite as complete as  is that of our Western art. In the beginning there were studies, of which  we know only through written records. But the relationship existing  between writing and painting from the dawn of historic time, permits us to  carry our studies of primitive periods very far back, even earlier than  the times of the sculptured works. We thus witness the gradual development  of that philosophical ideal which has dominated the entire history of  Chinese painting, forcing it to search for abstract form, and which  averted for so long the advent of triviality and decadence.    The goal sought by Chinese thought had already been reached in painting  when, in the third and fourth centuries, we are vouchsafed a glimpse of  it. It is a vision of a high order, in which the subtle intellectuality  corresponds to a society of refinement whose desires have already assumed  extreme proportions. Like Byzantium, heir to Hellenistic art, the China  of the Han dynasty and of Ku K'ai-chih was already progressing toward bold  conventions and soft harmonies, in which could be felt both the pride of  an intelligence which imposed its will upon Nature, and the weariness  following its sustained effort.      [Illustration: PLATE XXIV. PAINTING BY CHANG CHENG    Eighteenth Century. Collection of M. Worch.]    This refinement, arising from the exhaustion of a world which even thus  retained a certain primitive ruggedness, was succeeded by a stupendous  movement which followed in the wake of the preaching of Buddhism. With the  new gods we see the first appearance of definite and long-continued  foreign influences. Civilization was transformed and took on new life.  Then, as in the days of the great forerunners of the Florentine  Renaissance, there appeared a whole group of artists, prepared by the art,  at once crude and refined, of an earlier people. This group set resolutely  to work at the close study of forms, ascertaining the laws of their  structure and the conditions of the environment which produced them. The  period in which the work of Li Ss[)u]-hsuen, Li Chao-tao and Wang Wei was  produced may be likened to the fifteenth century in Florence with  Pisanello, Verocchio, Ghirlandajo and Masaccio. Similar conditions gave  birth to a movement that is directly comparable with the Italian movement  for, no matter how varied the outward appearances due to differences of  race and civilization, the fundamentals of art are the same everywhere and  pertain to the same mental attitudes.    The great leaders in periods preceding the T'ang dynasty paved the way to  the culmination which took place in the Sung period, and thus the fruit of  that prolonged activity is seen ripening between the tenth and the  thirteenth centuries. Through the gropings of the primitive period, the  heterodox philosophies and the mystic stirrings of Buddhism, Eastern  thought had arrived at an unquestionably noble comprehension of existence.  The impersonal mystery of the universe, its mighty principle, its manifold  manifestations and the secret which unveils itself in the innermost soul  of things are the conceptions which form the inspiration of Chinese  painting. These lofty thoughts are the source of that spirituality which  declares itself therein with such nobility. The religion to which they are  due will seem perhaps, to certain people, to be broader and less trammeled  than our own. There is no doubt that the entire Far East was under the  spell of its grandeur.    Up to this point art had sounded every depth and attained the highest  summits of human achievement. Thenceforward it concerned itself with  varying manifestations which were only the different modes of a formula  that was still flexible, until the time when--the great inspirations of  the past forgotten--there appear signs of a spirit on the quest for  realism, emerging from the ancient tradition. This is the distinctive note  in the evolution of Chinese painting under the last two dynasties. It  would seem as if, even in this guise, a universal need of the mind is  being satisfied, a need which we, too, have known after experiencing a  chilling academicism, and when modern culture had overthrown the ancient  idols. Chinese painters have thus completed a round analogous to that  traveled by our own artists.      [Illustration: PLATE XXV. TIGER IN A PINE FOREST    Eighteenth to Nineteenth Centuries. Collection of V. Goloubew.]    For the Far East as for Europe, the problem now presented is that of a  revival. Bent beneath the weight of the prestige of the past, too learned  in the last word of culture, modern art is seeking to find itself, groping  blindly, full of promising but unfinished works. The time has come when  there are signs throughout the world of a desire for a universal  civilization, by the reconciling of ancient divergencies. Europe and the  Far East bring into contrast the most vigorous traditions in history.  Henceforward there is interest for both civilizations in studying and in  coming to understand a foreign ideal. Though incomplete, these pages will  perhaps help to show that such a mutual comprehension is not impossible  and that, if egotistic prejudices are overcome, apparent dissimilarities  will be resolved into a profound identity. Thus will arise the elements of  a new culture. In coming to understand a mood which so fully reflects an  unknown world, the European mind will discover principles which will make  it rise superior to itself. May this broad comprehension of human thought  lead Europe to estimate with greater justice a civilization numbering its  years by thousands, and to refrain from thwarting the fulfillment of its  destiny.             *       *       *       *       *      BIBLIOGRAPHY        An Introduction to the Study of Chinese Pictorial Art.

Parkinson said she was in the  other room, but he would go and tell her. A shade crossed the brow of  both visitors; for the other room was the private room of the great  actor with whom Miss Aurora was performing, and she was of the kind that  does not inflame admiration without inflaming jealousy. In about half  a minute, however, the inner door opened, and she entered as she always  did, even in private life, so that the very silence seemed to be a roar  of applause, and one well-deserved. She was clad in a somewhat strange  garb of peacock green and peacock blue satins, that gleamed like blue  and green metals, such as delight children and aesthetes, and her heavy,  hot brown hair framed one of those magic faces which are dangerous to  all men, but especially to boys and to men growing grey. In company with  her male colleague, the great American actor, Isidore Bruno, she was  producing a particularly poetical and fantastic interpretation of  Midsummer Night's Dream: in which the artistic prominence was given  to Oberon and Titania, or in other words to Bruno and herself. Set in  dreamy and exquisite scenery, and moving in mystical dances, the  green costume, like burnished beetle-wings, expressed all the elusive  individuality of an elfin queen. But when personally confronted in what  was still broad daylight, a man looked only at the woman's face.    She greeted both men with the beaming and baffling smile which kept so  many males at the same just dangerous distance from her. She accepted  some flowers from Cutler, which were as tropical and expensive as his  victories; and another sort of present from Sir Wilson Seymour, offered  later on and more nonchalantly by that gentleman. For it was against  his breeding to show eagerness, and against his conventional  unconventionality to give anything so obvious as flowers. He had picked  up a trifle, he said, which was rather a curiosity, it was an ancient  Greek dagger of the Mycenaean Epoch, and might well have been worn in  the time of Theseus and Hippolyta. It was made of brass like all the  Heroic weapons, but, oddly enough, sharp enough to prick anyone still.  He had really been attracted to it by the leaf-like shape; it was as  perfect as a Greek vase. If it was of any interest to Miss Rome or could  come in anywhere in the play, he hoped she would--    The inner door burst open and a big figure appeared, who was more of  a contrast to the explanatory Seymour than even Captain Cutler. Nearly  six-foot-six, and of more than theatrical thews and muscles, Isidore  Bruno, in the gorgeous leopard skin and golden-brown garments of Oberon,  looked like a barbaric god. He leaned on a sort of hunting-spear, which  across a theatre looked a slight, silvery wand, but which in the small  and comparatively crowded room looked as plain as a pike-staff--and as  menacing. His vivid black eyes rolled volcanically, his bronzed  face, handsome as it was, showed at that moment a combination of  high cheekbones with set white teeth, which recalled certain American  conjectures about his origin in the Southern plantations.    \"Aurora,\" he began, in that deep voice like a drum of passion that had  moved so many audiences, \"will you--\"    He stopped indecisively because a sixth figure had suddenly presented  itself just inside the doorway--a figure so incongruous in the scene as  to be almost comic. It was a very short man in the black uniform of  the Roman secular clergy, and looking (especially in such a presence as  Bruno's and Aurora's) rather like the wooden Noah out of an ark. He  did not, however, seem conscious of any contrast, but said with dull  civility: \"I believe Miss Rome sent for me.\"    A shrewd observer might have remarked that the emotional temperature  rather rose at so unemotional an interruption. The detachment of a  professional celibate seemed to reveal to the others that they stood  round the woman as a ring of amorous rivals; just as a stranger coming  in with frost on his coat will reveal that a room is like a furnace. The  presence of the one man who did not care about her increased Miss Rome's  sense that everybody else was in love with her, and each in a somewhat  dangerous way: the actor with all the appetite of a savage and a spoilt  child; the soldier with all the simple selfishness of a man of will  rather than mind; Sir Wilson with that daily hardening concentration  with which old Hedonists take to a hobby; nay, even the abject  Parkinson, who had known her before her triumphs, and who followed her  about the room with eyes or feet, with the dumb fascination of a dog.    A shrewd person might also have noted a yet odder thing. The man like a  black wooden Noah (who was not wholly without shrewdness) noted it with  a considerable but contained amusement. It was evident that the great  Aurora, though by no means indifferent to the admiration of the other  sex, wanted at this moment to get rid of all the men who admired her and  be left alone with the man who did not--did not admire her in that  sense at least; for the little priest did admire and even enjoy the  firm feminine diplomacy with which she set about her task. There was,  perhaps, only one thing that Aurora Rome was clever about, and that was  one half of humanity--the other half. The little priest watched, like a  Napoleonic campaign, the swift precision of her policy for expelling all  while banishing none. Bruno, the big actor, was so babyish that it  was easy to send him off in brute sulks, banging the door. Cutler, the  British officer, was pachydermatous to ideas, but punctilious about  behaviour. He would ignore all hints, but he would die rather than  ignore a definite commission from a lady. As to old Seymour, he had to  be treated differently; he had to be left to the last. The only way to  move him was to appeal to him in confidence as an old friend, to let him  into the secret of the clearance. The priest did really admire Miss Rome  as she achieved all these three objects in one selected action.    She went across to Captain Cutler and said in her sweetest manner:  \"I shall value all these flowers, because they must be your favourite  flowers. But they won't be complete, you know, without my favourite  flower. Do go over to that shop round the corner and get me some  lilies-of-the-valley, and then it will be quite lovely.\"    The first object of her diplomacy, the exit of the enraged Bruno, was at  once achieved. He had already handed his spear in a lordly style, like  a sceptre, to the piteous Parkinson, and was about to assume one of  the cushioned seats like a throne. But at this open appeal to his rival  there glowed in his opal eyeballs all the sensitive insolence of the  slave; he knotted his enormous brown fists for an instant, and then,  dashing open the door, disappeared into his own apartments beyond. But  meanwhile Miss Rome's experiment in mobilizing the British Army had not  succeeded so simply as seemed probable. Cutler had indeed risen stiffly  and suddenly, and walked towards the door, hatless, as if at a word of  command. But perhaps there was something ostentatiously elegant about  the languid figure of Seymour leaning against one of the looking-glasses  that brought him up short at the entrance, turning his head this way and  that like a bewildered bulldog.    \"I must show this stupid man where to go,\" said Aurora in a whisper to  Seymour, and ran out to the threshold to speed the parting guest.    Seymour seemed to be listening, elegant and unconscious as was his  posture, and he seemed relieved when he heard the lady call out some  last instructions to the Captain, and then turn sharply and run laughing  down the passage towards the other end, the end on the terrace above the  Thames. Yet a second or two after Seymour's brow darkened again. A man  in his position has so many rivals, and he remembered that at the other  end of the passage was the corresponding entrance to Bruno's private  room. He did not lose his dignity; he said some civil words to Father  Brown about the revival of Byzantine architecture in the Westminster  Cathedral, and then, quite naturally, strolled out himself into the  upper end of the passage. Father Brown and Parkinson were left  alone, and they were neither of them men with a taste for superfluous  conversation. The dresser went round the room, pulling out  looking-glasses and pushing them in again, his dingy dark coat and  trousers looking all the more dismal since he was still holding the  festive fairy spear of King Oberon. Every time he pulled out the frame  of a new glass, a new black figure of Father Brown appeared; the absurd  glass chamber was full of Father Browns, upside down in the air like  angels, turning somersaults like acrobats, turning their backs to  everybody like very rude persons.    Father Brown seemed quite unconscious of this cloud of witnesses, but  followed Parkinson with an idly attentive eye till he took himself  and his absurd spear into the farther room of Bruno. Then he abandoned  himself to such abstract meditations as always amused him--calculating  the angles of the mirrors, the angles of each refraction, the angle at  which each must fit into the wall...when he heard a strong but strangled  cry.    He sprang to his feet and stood rigidly listening. At the same instant  Sir Wilson Seymour burst back into the room, white as ivory. \"Who's that  man in the passage?\" he cried. \"Where's that dagger of mine?\"    Before Father Brown could turn in his heavy boots Seymour was plunging  about the room looking for the weapon. And before he could possibly  find that weapon or any other, a brisk running of feet broke upon the  pavement outside, and the square face of Cutler was thrust into the  same doorway. He was still grotesquely grasping a bunch of  lilies-of-the-valley. \"What's this?\" he cried. \"What's that creature  down the passage? Is this some of your tricks?\"    \"My tricks!\""]]]
