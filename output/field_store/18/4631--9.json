[Illustration: Fig. 226.--Tool Operation when Paring Out the Hinge Recess  in the Door.]    SAWING FOR THE RECESS.--After marking out for the hinge, as shown at Fig.  224, take a fine-toothed saw (a dovetail saw is considered the best) and  saw down as shown at Fig. 225, care being taken not to cut beyond the  gauge lines. In this sketch three intermediate saw kerfs are shown, but  if the hinge is of great length, say 5 or 6 ins., the removal of the  waste wood will be greatly facilitated by the addition of more  intermediate saw kerfs. These cuts sever the cross fibres and allow the  timber to be easily pared away in short lengths.    In Fig. 226 we see the tool operation when paring out the hinge recess.  At the left of the drawing the recess is shown marked. Take a 3/4 in.  chisel and, using it as a knife (see A), deepen the gauge lines. Then  stab the chisel downwards, as at B, to deepen the end lines. Next, take  the chisel and pare away the back of the recess as at C. The work may  then be completed by paring neatly till the bottom of the recess is flat.    [Illustration: Fig. 227., Fig. 228. The Hingeing of a Box Lid.]    STOPPED HINGED JOINTS FOR BOX WORK.--Fig. 227 is a section through a  small box similar to a lady's work-box (the back of the box in the  illustration is enlarged in thickness to clearly show the position of the  hinge). In this case the knuckle of the hinge is let into the woodwork  until it is flush with the back of the box, and the gauge would have to  be set to the total width of the hinge. The back edges of the lid and the  back edge of the lower portion of the box are planed away at an angle of  45 degrees as indicated by the dotted lines.    Fig. 228 shows the same box with the lid open, and it will be observed  that the chamfered edges come together and form a stop which prevents the  lid falling backwards and breaking the box. This method of letting-in the  knuckle flush is a useful one for box work because the ordinary stock  brass butt hinge can be used. Attention may, however, be called to the  \"stopped butt-hinge,\" which is specially made to answer the above  purpose; in its action a similar mechanical principle as the one applied  to the box is used.    [Illustration: Fig. 229.--Strap Hinge.]    [Illustration: Fig. 230.--Reversible or Double-folding Screen Hinge.]    [Illustration: Fig. 231.--Pivot Hinge for Screens.]    [Illustration: Fig. 232.--Non-reversible Screen Hinge.]    TYPES OF HINGES.--Fig. 229 is an elongated variety of the butt hinge,  known in the trade as \"strap hinge,\" \"desk hinge,\" or \"bagatelle hinge.\"  As its name indicates, it is used on folding bagatelle tables, small  writing desks, and other types of work that have but a narrow margin on  which to fix the hinges. The long, narrow plates are sunk flush into the  wood, the knuckle or rounded portion projecting.    [Illustration: Fig. 233.--Back Flap Hinge.]    [Illustration: Fig. 234.--Card Table Hinge.]    [Illustration: Fig. 235.--Pivot Hinge.]    [Illustration: Fig. 236.--Rising Butt Hinge.]    Fig. 230 is an illustration of the reversible or double-folding screen  hinge. Half the thickness of this hinge is let into each wing of the  draught screen, allowing the screen to be folded either way. The hinge is  costly, but effective in use.    Fig. 231 is a type of pivot hinge which is used to fix at the top and  bottom of a screen.    Fig. 232 is the non-reversible screen hinge and, as its name implies,  will only fold in one direction.    Fig. 233 is a back flap hinge with a specially wide wing, used for the  fall-down leaf of small tables and similar articles.    Fig. 234 is a card table hinge. This is let into the edges of the table,  so that all is flush or level both above and below the surface.    CENTRE OR PIVOT HINGES.--Fig. 235 is a centre or pivot hinge, used on the  top and bottom of wardrobe doors, more particularly the interior door of  a three-winged wardrobe where the method of fixing is confined to the  cornice and plinth. The flange carrying the pins or pivot is let into the  top and bottom of the door, the remaining flange being let into the  cornice and plinth respectively.    RISING BUTT HINGES.--Fig. 236 is the rising butt hinge, used on dining  and drawing-room doors, so that when the door is opened the door rises  sufficiently to clear the thickness of the carpet. This hinge has also an  advantage over the ordinary butt hinge in that it is self-closing,  _i.e._, the weight of the door _plus_ the bevel on the hinge joint causes  the door to close. Band and hook hinges and other ordinary varieties are  too well known to require illustrating.    ACUTE ANGLE HINGEING.--Fig. 237 is a sectional plan of a corner cupboard  showing a good method of hingeing the door. The inset _a_ shows an  enlarged view of the corner carrying the hinge, also the adaptor piece  _c_, which is fitted to the inside edge of the cupboard so that the  hinged edges are at 90 degrees to the face. This is a far better and  stronger method than that shown at _b_, which is often attempted with  disastrous results. The incorrect method _b_ allows insufficient wood for  fixing purposes, and in nearly all cases the thin edge of the door breaks  away during the making and fitting, or soon after completion. The adaptor  piece may have a face mould worked upon it to give a pilaster-like  appearance if fancy so dictates.    [Illustration: Fig. 237.--Hingeing Door of Corner Cupboard.]    [Illustration: Fig. 238.--Inside Hingeing: Method of Letting Butt Hinge  into Door Frame and Carcase.]    INSIDE HINGEING.--When a door is being hung _inside_ the carcase (that  is, not hinged _over_ the ends) it is permissible, in the case of light  work, to let the whole thickness of the hinge into the door; and when  screwing the door to the carcase it is usual to fix the knuckle of the  hinge flush with the face of the carcase, thus allowing the door frame to  stand back, making a break of about 1/8 in. with the face. The marking  gauge should be set to the full width of the hinge; the mark, gauged on  the inside of the carcase end, thus forms a line to guide the worker  whilst fixing the door. To successfully fix a door it generally requires  two persons, one to hold the door in position, whilst the other bores the  holes and fixes the screws.    [Illustration: Fig. 239.--Showing Top and Bottom of Carcase Cut Back to  allow Door to Close.]    [Illustration: Fig. 240.--Outside Hingeing.]    [Illustration: Fig. 241.--Section.]    Fig. 238 shows the correct method of fitting butt hinges on high-class  work. One wing of the hinge is let into the door, and the other wing is  let into the carcase or door jamb, thus distributing a proportion of the  weight to the carcase end instead of allowing the whole of the weight to  be carried by the screws as would be the case in _a_, Fig. 237. The  method of sinking each portion of the hinge into the door and carcase  respectively is costly; hence it is not the general practice in cheap  work. In Fig. 239 the top and bottom of carcase (T and B) are shown set  back to allow the door to close.    OUTSIDE HINGEING.--Fig. 240 illustrates the portion of a door frame and  carcase end when the door is hung on the face of the carcase. The correct  method of letting in the hinge is shown in the enlarged section (Fig.  241), but, as previously mentioned, the hinge may have its entire  thickness let into the door frame where it is of a light character. The  door frame projects slightly over the carcase end, and occasionally a  bead mould is worked on the edge of the door so as to give a finish and  partly hide the joint. The bead would, of course, be the same size as the  diameter of the knuckle of the hinge; and the knuckle, therefore, will  form a continuation of the bead and give a workmanshiplike finish.    FALL FRONTS.--Fig. 242 is a sectional view of a fall front writing bureau  fitted with centre or pivot hinges and arranged so that the edges form a  stop when the desk front is turned to a horizontal position. The position  for the fitting of the brass plates carrying the pivot-pin is somewhat  awkward; but, by first sinking the plates into the carcase ends, and then  slotting the edges of the fall, it will be found that the fall front may  be put in from its horizontal position, and that sufficient room is left  to enable the screwdriver to be manipulated without inconvenience.    [Illustration: Fig. 242.--Fall Front of Writing Bureau.]    [Illustration: Fig. 243.--Revolving Fly Rail for Table. See Pivoted Fly  or Front Rail.]    [Illustration: Fig. 244.--Draught Screen Tape Hinge.]    FLY RAIL.--Fig. 243 is a sketch of a small table with the top removed. A  revolving fly rail is shown pivoted upon a piece of 1/4-in. wire. The  object of this fly rail is to form a support to the small hinged  drop-leaf of the table. This method is suitable for small occasional  tables and similar articles.    DRAUGHT SCREENS.--Fig. 244 illustrates the end elevation and plan of a  draught screen which is constructed of a light framework and covered with  baize or American cloth. The reversible double-folding hinge (Fig. 230)  would answer admirably for such a screen. Cases occur, however, where it  is desired to hinge a screen to be used for an invalid's bedside, and it  is then important that all draught should be excluded through the jointed  edges. The double reversible hinge will not fulfil these conditions, and  the following method is therefore adopted.    In the plan, Fig. 244, A and B, two laths of hardwood (beech, birch or  mahogany answer splendidly) are shown. They are made the same length and  the same width as the edges of the screen, the corners being slightly  rounded away.    A double-folding, draught-proof hinge is then made as follows: Procure  good fine webbing, about 1-1/4 in. wide, and the necessary large-headed  tacks. Lay the laths side by side as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21534"],[0,"Textiles and Clothing (#12)"],[1,"shed, it should be opened and pressed flat.    [Sidenote: Overcasting]    (7) Overcasting is a slanting stitch used to keep raw edges from  ravelling. This stitch, like oversewing, may be worked from right to  left or from left to right.    The hem stitch and blind or slip stitch will be considered under hems.      ORNAMENTAL STITCHES    Never use a knot in any embroidery, but start by running a few stitches  along the line which is to be covered.    [Sidenote: Outline Stitch]    (1) The outline stitch is the simplest of all embroidery stitches. Take  a long stitch on the surface, with the needle pointing towards the chest  in the line to be covered, and a short back stitch on the under side of  the material. The effect of the under or wrong side of the material is  exactly that of an ordinary back stitch. The beauty of this stitch  depends upon its regularity and in always keeping the thread on the  same side of the needle.      [Illustration: ORNAMENTAL STITCHES    _a_--Outline; _b_--Chain; _c_--Cat; _c'_--Catch; _d_--Single Feather;  _e_--Double Feather; _f_--Tripple Feather; _g_--Modified Feather;  _h_--Double Feather with Knots; _i_--French Knots and Outline;  _j_--Herring Bone; _k_--Fancy Feather; _l_--Cat Stitch with French  Knots.]      [Sidenote: Chain Stitch]    (2) The chain stitch when perfectly done should look like the stitch  made by a single-thread machine. This stitch is made by taking the  thread toward the worker, and before the needle is drawn out of the  cloth the thread is held by the thumb under the point of the needle, as  in a buttonhole, making a loop. The needle is inserted in the last loop  for the next stitch. The chain stitch is used in modern embroidery as an  outline and for darning, but in old embroidery, the outline and chain  stitches were used for filling as well. They are found in Persian,  Indian, and Italian Renaissance work. Like the feather stitch, the chain  stitch is worked towards the worker.    [Sidenote: Cat Stitch]    (3) The cat stitch or herringbone stitch is an alternate slanting back  stitch, the needle being placed first to the right and then to the left.  This stitch must be worked evenly to be effective. It is used to finish  flannel seams and hems, fasten down linings, opened seams, and canvas  facings and featherbone, in millinery--in fact, this stitch is one of  the most useful in sewing. The _catch_ stitch is a variation of the cat  stitch. Instead of pointing the needle towards the chest, the stitch is  taken parallel with the chest. It is used for about the same purposes as  the cat stitch. As with the outline stitch, the cat stitch is worked  _from_ the worker.    [Sidenote: Loop Stitch]    (4) Blanket or loop stitch, used to ornament the edge of blankets, etc.,  and for finishing the edge of stockinet or web material, is worked  from left to right, the edge of the material being held towards the  worker. Start with three or four running stitches along the edge so the  line of stitching will cover them. Insert the needle the desired width  from the edge, draw it towards you down over the thread, being careful  not to draw the thread too tightly over the edge of the flannel. Fasten  the thread by taking running stitches under the last blanket stitch on  the wrong side.      [Illustration: _HEM STITCHING_    _a_--Position of Needle; _a'_--Finished Hem Stitch; _b_--Ladder Stitch;  _c_--Example of Drawn Work Finished with Loop and Cat Stitches.]      [Sidenote: Feather Stitch]    (5) Single, double, and triple feather or coral stitches may be made  very ornamental and are used in all kinds of sewing and on all  materials. They are always made towards the worker, the stitches being  taken alternately to the right and left of the line of the design. The  thread should always be carried under the needle as in a buttonhole  stitch. The design may be varied by taking the stitches diagonally or  straight, by making them close or separated, etc.    [Sidenote: Hem Stitch]    (6) Hemstitching is used for ornament in making hems and tucks. The  first step in hemstitching is the drawing of threads. Rubbing the cloth  along the line of threads to be drawn will make the drawing easier if  the cloth is sized. After the threads are drawn, the hem is turned and  basted even with the lowest edge of the drawn space. Insert the needle  into the edge of the hem and material, taking up a cluster of threads  bring the thread under the needle to form a buttonhole stitch or make a  simple stitch in the edge of the fold. The number of threads drawn and  the number in a cluster must be determined by the coarseness or  fineness of the material, the greater number being drawn and taken in  fine material. There are several methods of hemstitching, but the  results are about the same.      [Illustration: EMBROIDERY STITCHES    Eyelet Embroidery, Embroidery Button Hole, Flat Satin Stitch.]      [Sidenote: French Knots]    (7) French knots are used in connection with other stitches for borders  enclosed in outline and chain stitches, in initials, centers of flowers,  and as a filling-in stitch. The simplest method is of taking a small  back stitch, bringing the thread from the _eye_ of the needle under the  point from right to left and drawing the needle perpendicularly from  the cloth. Place the needle back of the knot and bring the point out in  the place where the next knot is to be made. The size of the thread will  determine the size of the knot.    [Sidenote: Embroidery Buttonhole]    (8) The embroidery buttonhole stitch has many possibilities and many  variations. It is worked from left to right instead of from right to  left as in a buttonhole. The thread from the work is carried under the  point of the needle from left to right, just the reverse of the  buttonhole. This stitch is used on flannel and in embroidery of all  kinds; it may be padded or worked flat and the stitches may be taken a  distance apart or near together.    [Sidenote: Cross Stitch]    (9) The cross stitch is worked on linen, scrim, canvas, or any  open-meshed material. If done on a flat, smooth surface, it will be  necessary to work over canvas, afterwards drawing out the canvas  threads. The canvas should be well basted on the material, the warp  threads of the canvas lying _perfectly straight_ on a line with the warp  threads of the material on which the pattern is worked. The stitches  should always run the same way. If the first ground stitches are made  from left to right, from bottom towards the top, the cross stitches  should be made from right to left from the top towards the bottom. All  the ground stitches run one way and the cross stitches in the opposite  way.    This stitch is used for marking table linen, underwear, and embroidery  designs. When marking linen and unlined work, make the under side very  neat by running the thread under the stitches already made, instead of  taking a long stitch when beginning in another part of the letter or  design.    [Sidenote: Satin Stitch]    (10) The satin stitch is an over and over stitch and is used on  materials of all kinds for marking linen, etc.    The _padding_ is the first step and should be done in long even stitches  placed closely and over one another in the center. The size and  proportions of the figure or letters determine the size of the thread.  Fine thread gives the best results. The outline should be run twice;  this keeps the edge firm. An even darning or basting stitches, chain  stitches or outline stitch may be used if the space is not too small.  The padding may be worked in an embroidery hoop to keep it smooth and  even. Scallops may be padded in the same way or worked flat.      [Illustration: EMBROIDERY BUTTON HOLE AND BLANKET STITCHES    Scallops Outlined and Padded.]      In large figures the stitches are laid closely and exactly parallel the  entire length of the form. They may be straight across or at an angle,  but the one slant must be maintained throughout. In small curved  figures, the stitches may be placed more closely at the inner edge and  spread slightly at the outer edge. In flat work where the leaf or petal  is large, two or three stitches taken in the cloth, back of the face  stitch, holds them even and prevents misplacement in laundering. (All  embroidery should be ironed on the wrong side.)      [Illustration: ARROW HEAD, DOUBLE ARROW HEAD AND CROW'S FOOT.]      [Sidenote: Eyelet Embroidery]    Eyelet embroidery is a simple over and over stitch forming a smooth,  round edge. Like satin stitch, all outlines are run with an even darning  stitch, except the very small eyelet holes, made with a stiletto. Long  or oval openings must be cut through the center.    [Sidenote: Shadow Embroidery]    Shadow embroidery is worked on the wrong side of thin material, using  the cat stitch. The outline of the design only shows on the right side,  the body of the design being seen dimly through the material.    [Sidenote: Arrow Heads]    The arrow head and crow's foot are ornamental fastenings used in fine  tailoring as endings for seams, tucks, plaits, and at corners. They are  made as shown in the illustration.    Mercerized cotton, linen, or any of the embroidery silks can be used for  these stitches, in all sizes and colors, or they can be worked with  ordinary thread, cotton or linen, sewing silk, or twist. Cotton thread  wears better than linen.      HEMS    [Sidenote: Folding Hems]    A hem is a fold of goods twice folded to protect a raw edge. The first  turn or fold of the hem is the most important. It should be straight and  even, _folded to a thread_, for upon it depends the beauty of the hem.  The hem should always be turned towards the worker and creased firmly,  but never pleated along the fold. First crease the narrow fold, then  crease the second fold the desired width, marking by a measure and baste  not too near the edge. The first fold _along_ the _woof_ threads should  be at least one-fourth of an inch in"]]]
