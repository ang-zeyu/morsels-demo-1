When it happens that you have some cold boiled potatoes, this is the way  to fry them:--First cut the potatoes in thick slices, and fry them in a  frying-pan with butter or dripping, just enough to season them, and as  they fry, lift or scrape them from the bottom of the pan with an iron  spoon, to prevent them from sticking to the bottom and burning, which,  by imparting a bitter taste, would spoil them; when all are fried of a  very light brown colour, season with pepper and salt.      No. 140. HOW TO MASH POTATOES.    Either steam or boil the potatoes, as indicated in Nos. 135 and 136, and  immediately after they are done, while steaming hot, put the potatoes  into a clean saucepan, and break or mash them by stirring them  vigorously with a fork; when all are broken smooth and mealy, add a  little _hot_ milk, with a bit of butter, pepper, and salt; work the  whole well together for a few minutes, and eat the mashed potatoes while  hot.      No. 141. BAKED MASHED POTATOES.    Prepare the mashed potatoes as shown in the preceding Number, put them  in a dish, smooth them over with a knife, put some bits of butter on the  top, and set them before the fire, turning them occasionally to brown  them equally all round.      No. 142. MASHED POTATOES WITH LING.    Ling is a kind of dried salt fish; it is cheaper than the ordinary sort  of salted codfish. It should be washed and well soaked in plenty of  tepid water for six hours before it is boiled in cold water; when taken  out of the pot it should be divided into large flakes, mixed with mashed  potatoes, and baked in a dish, as directed in the preceding Number.      No. 143. HOW TO STEW POTATOES.    First boil the potatoes, and then put a little butter, a chopped onion,  half a pint of milk, or water, pepper and salt to season; boil this for  ten minutes, then add the potatoes, previously cooked; boil all together  for ten minutes, and dish them up.      No. 144. BUTTERED PARSNIPS.    Scrape or peel the parsnips, and boil them in hot water till they are  done quite tender, then drain off all the water, add a bit of butter,  some chopped parsley, pepper and salt; shake them together on the fire  until all is well mixed.      No. 145. BUTTERED SWEDISH TURNIPS.    Swedish turnips are mostly given as food to cattle; true, but there is  no good reason why they should not be considered as excellent food for  man, for they are sweeter, and yield more substance than the ordinary  turnips; let them be peeled, boiled in plenty of water, and when done,  mashed with a little milk, butter, pepper, and salt.      No. 146. HOW TO COOK SPINACH.    Pick it thoroughly, wash the spinach, boil it in plenty of hot water  with salt in it, and when it is done, drain it free from all moisture,  chop it up, put it in a saucepan with butter, pepper, and salt; stir all  together on the fire for five minutes.      No. 147. FRIED CABBAGE AND BACON.    First, boil the cabbage, and when done and drained free from water, chop  it up. Next fry some rashers of bacon, and when done, lay them on a  plate before the fire; put the chopped cabbage in the frying-pan, and  fry it with the fat from the bacon, then put this on a dish with the  rashers upon it.      No. 148. PEAS AND BACON.    Shave off any brown rancid part from the bacon, and put it on to boil in  plenty of cold water; when it is nearly done put in the peas with a good  bunch of mint, and let all boil together until the peas are done soft;  then dish up the peas round the bacon.      No. 149. BAKED OR ROASTED ONIONS.    Do not peel the onions, but put them in their natural state to roast on  the hobs, turning them round to the fire occasionally, in order that  they may be equally roasted all over and through; when they are well  done, remove the outer skin, split them open, add a bit of butter,  pepper and salt, and a few drops of vinegar.      No. 150. HOW TO COOK BROAD BEANS.    Boil the beans in hot water with a bunch of winter savory and some salt,  and when done and drained, put them into a saucepan with the chopped  savory, butter, a pinch of flour, pepper and salt, and toss all together  for a few minutes over the fire.      No. 151. HOW TO COOK FRENCH BEANS.    String the beans and boil them in hot water with salt; when done and  drained, put them into a saucepan, with butter, a pinch of flour,  chopped parsley, pepper and salt, and stir them gently on the fire for  two or three minutes.      No. 152. HOW TO COOK VEGETABLE MARROW.    This is a cheap and excellent vegetable; let them be peeled, split them,  and remove the seedy part; boil them in hot water with salt, and when  done, eat them with a bit of butter, pepper, and salt.      No. 153. WHITE HARICOT BEANS.    In France, haricot beans form a principal part in the staple articles of  food for the working-classes, and indeed for the entire population; it  is much to be desired that some effectual means should be adopted, for  the purpose of introducing and encouraging the use of this most  excellent vegetable among the people of England as a general article of  daily food, more especially in the winter. If this desideratum could be  accomplished, its beneficial result would go far to assist in rendering  us in a measure independent of the potato crop, which, of late years,  has proved so uncertain. I am aware that haricot beans, as well as  lentils, as at present imported and retailed as a mere luxury to such as  possess cooks who know how to dress them, might lead to the rejection of  my proposal that they should, or could, be adopted as food by the  people; but I see no reason why haricot beans should not be imported to  this country in such quantities as would enable the importers to retail  them at a somewhat similar low price as that in which they are sold at  in France. In that case, they would become cheap enough to come within  the reach of the poorest. And under the impression that this wish of  mine may be eventually realized, I will here give you instructions how  to cook haricot beans to the greatest advantage.      No. 154. HOW TO DRESS HARICOT BEANS.    Put a quart of white haricot beans in plenty of cold water in a pan in  order that they may soak through the night; the next day drain off the  water in which they have soaked, and put them into a pot with three  quarts of _cold_ water, a little grease or butter, some pepper and salt,  and set them on the fire to boil _very gently_ until they are thoroughly  done; this will take about two hours' gentle boiling; when done, the  haricot beans are to be drained free from excess of moisture, and put  into a saucepan with chopped parsley, butter, pepper and salt; stir the  whole carefully on the fire for five minutes, and serve them for dinner  with or without meat as may best suit your means.      No. 155. HARICOT BEANS, ANOTHER WAY.    When the haricot beans have been boiled as shown in the preceding  Number, chop fine a couple of onions, and fry them in a saucepan with a  bit of butter, then add the haricot beans, pepper and salt; stir all  together and serve them out to your family.      No. 156. A SALAD OF HARICOT BEANS.    Well-boiled haricot beans, cold, are made into an excellent salad, as  follows:--Put the haricot beans into a bowl, season with chopped  parsley, green onions, salad oil, vinegar, pepper and salt, and slices  of beet-root. Mix thoroughly.      No. 157. LENTILS.    Lentils are a species of vetches much in use in France as a staple  article of food in the winter; there are two sorts, those denominated  \"_a la reine_,\" a small brown flat-looking seed, while the other sort is  somewhat larger--of the size of small peas, and flat; both sorts are  equally nutritious, and are to be treated in exactly the same way as  herein indicated for cooking haricot beans.    These, as well as haricot beans, may be boiled with a piece of bacon.      No. 158. A RELISH FOR SUPPER.    Prepare some oysters, as shown in No. 54, and when poured upon the toast  in their dish, strew all over their surface equal quantities of bread  raspings and grated cheese; hold a red-hot shovel over the top until it  becomes slightly coloured, and eat this little delicacy while hot.      No. 159. HOW TO MAKE AN OMELET.    Break three or four eggs into a basin, add a little chopped shalot, and  parsley, pepper, and salt; put an ounce of butter in a frying-pan on the  fire, and as soon as the butter begins to fry, beat up the eggs, etc.,  with a fork for two minutes; immediately pour the whole into the  frying-pan, and put it on the fire, stirring the eggs with an iron spoon  as they become set and the omelet appears nearly done; fold all together  in the form of a bolster, and turn it out on to its dish.      No. 160. FRIED EGGS AND BACON.    First, fry the rashers of bacon, and then break the eggs into the  frying-pan without disturbing the yolks, and as soon as these are just  set, or half-done, slip them out on to the rashers of bacon which you  have already placed in a dish.      No. 161. BUTTERED EGGS.    Fry half an ounce of butter in a frying-pan, then break three or four  eggs into this; season with chopped parsley, pepper and salt, and again  set the pan on the fire for two minutes. At the end of this time the  eggs will be sufficiently set to enable you to slip them gently out of  the pan upon a plate; and to finish cooking the eggs, it will be  necessary to place them or hold them in front of the fire for a couple  of minutes longer.      No. 162. EGGS WITH BROWN BUTTER.    Cook the eggs as directed in the foregoing Number, and when you have  slipped them out on to a dish, put a piece of butter into the  frying-pan, and stir it on the fire until it becomes quite brown (_not  burnt_); then add two table-spoonfuls of vinegar, pepper, and salt; boil  for two minutes, and pour this over the eggs.      No. 163. EGGS STEWED WITH CHEESE.    Fry three eggs in a pan with one ounce of butter, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22117"],[0,"Across Coveted Lands; or, a Journey from Flushing (Holland) to Calcutta Overland (#12)"],[1,"a capital too near the  Caspian Sea. Isfahan was selected as the future capital, from which time  Kasvin, semi-abandoned, began its decline.    In 1870 a famine devastated the town to a considerable extent, but even  previous to that a great portion of the place had been left to decay, so  that to-day one sees large stretches of ruined houses all round the  neighbourhood and in Kasvin itself. The buildings are mostly one-storied,  very few indeed boasting of an upper floor. The pleasant impression one  receives on entering the city is mostly caused by the quantity of verdure  and vegetation all round.    One of the principal things which strike the traveller in Persia,  especially on nearing a big city, is the literal myriads of curious  conical heaps, with a pit in the centre, that one notices running across  the plains in long, interminable rows, generally towards the mountains.  These are the _kanats_, the astounding aqueducts with which dried-up  Persia is bored in all directions underground, the canals that lead fresh  water from the distant springs to the cities, to the villages, and to  irrigate the fields. The ancient process of making these _kanats_ has  descended unchanged to the modern Persian, who is really a marvellous  expert--when he chooses to use his skill--at conveying water where Nature  has not provided it. I watched some men making one of these _kanats_.  They had bored a vertical hole about three feet in diameter, over which a  wooden windlass had been erected. One man was working at the bottom of  the shaft. By means of buckets the superfluous earth was gradually raised  up to the surface, and the hole bored further. The earth removed in the  excavation is then embanked all round the aperture of the shaft. When  the required depth is attained a tunnel is pierced, mostly with the hands  and a small shovel, in a horizontal direction, and seldom less than four  feet high, two feet wide, just big enough to let the workman through.  Then another shaft has to be made for ventilation's sake and to raise to  the surface the displaced earth. Miles of these _kanats_ are thus bored,  with air shafts every ten to twenty feet distant. In many places one sees  thirty, forty, fifty parallel long lines of these aqueducts, with several  thousand shafts, dotting the surface of the ground.    Near ancient towns and villages one finds a great many of these _kanats_  dry and disused at present, and nearly everywhere one sees people at work  making fresh ones, for how to get water is one of the great and serious  questions in the land of Iran. Near Kasvin these _kanats_ are  innumerable, and the water carried by them goes through the streets of  the city, with holes here and there in the middle of the road to draw it  up. These holes are a serious danger to any one given to walking about  without looking where he is placing his feet. It is mainly due to these  artificial water-tunnels that the plain of Kasvin, otherwise arid and  oppressively hot, has been rendered extremely fertile.    There are a great many gardens with plenty of fruit-trees. Vineyards  abound, producing excellent stoneless grapes, which, when dried, are  mostly exported to Russia. Pomegranates, water-melons, cucumbers, and  cotton are also grown. Excellent horses and camels are bred here.    Kasvin being the half-way house, as it were, between Resht and Teheran,  and an important city in itself, is bound--even if only in a reflected  manner--to feel the good effects of having through communication to the  Caspian and the capital made so easy by the completion of the Russian  road.    The silk and rice export trade for Bagdad has gone up during the last two  years, and in the fertile plain in which Kasvin lies agriculture is  beginning to look up again, although not quite so much as in the Resht  district, which is naturally the first to reap benefit from the  development of Northern Persia.    The chief manufactures of Kasvin are carpets, a kind of coarse  cotton-cloth called _kerbas_, velvet, brocades, iron-ware and  sword-blades, which are much appreciated by Persians.    There is a large bazaar in which many cheap European goods are sold  besides the more picturesque articles of local manufacture.    From a strategical point of view, Kasvin occupies a position not to be  overlooked, guarding as it does the principal entrance from the south  into the Ghilan province.          CHAPTER VIII         Four thousand feet above sea-level--Castellated walls--An       obnoxious individual--Luggage weighing--The strange figure of an       African black--How he saved an Englishman's life--Teheran       hotels--Interesting guests--Life of bachelors in Teheran--The       Britisher in Persia--Home early--Social       sets--Etiquette--Missionaries--Foreign communities--The servant       question.      A few hours' rest to give one's aching bones a chance of returning into  their normal condition and position, and amidst the profound salaams of  the rest-house servants, we speed away towards Teheran, 130 versts more  according to the Russian road measurement (about 108 miles). We gallop on  the old, wide and flat road, on which the traffic alone diverts  one,--long strings of donkeys, of camels, every now and then a splendid  horse with a swaggering rider. We are travelling on the top of the  plateau, and are keeping at an altitude slightly above 4,000 feet.  Distant mountains lie to the north, otherwise there is absolutely nothing  to see, no vegetation worth mentioning, everything dry and barren.    Now and then, miles and miles apart, comes a quadrangular or rectangular,  castellated mud wall enclosing a cluster of fruit trees and vegetable  gardens; then miles and miles again of dreary, barren country.    Were it not for the impudence of the natives--increasing to a  maximum--there is nothing to warn the traveller that one is approaching  the capital of the Persian Empire, and one finds one's self at the gate  of the city without the usual excitement of perceiving from a distance a  high tower, or a dome or a steeple or a fortress, or a landmark of some  sort or other, to make one enjoy the approach of one's journey's end.    Abdulabad, 4,015 feet, Kishslak, 3,950 feet, Sankarabad, 4,210 feet,  Sulimaneh, 4,520 feet, are the principal places and main elevations on  the road, but from the last-named place the incline in the plateau tends  to descend very gently. Teheran is at an altitude of 3,865 feet.    Six farsakhs from Teheran, where we had to change horses, an individual  connected with the transport company made himself very obnoxious, and  insisted on accompanying the carriage to Teheran. He was picturesquely  attired in a brown long coat, and displayed a nickel-plated revolver,  with a leather belt of cartridges. He was cruel to the horses and a  nuisance to the coachman. He interfered considerably with the progress of  the carriage and made himself unbearable in every possible way. When I  stopped at a khafe-khana for a glass of tea, he actually removed a wheel  of the carriage, which we had considerable difficulty in putting right  again, and he pounded the coachman on the head with the butt of his  revolver, in order, as far as I could understand, that he should be  induced to go half-shares with him in the backshish that the driver would  receive at the end of the stage.    All this provided some entertainment, until we reached the Teheran gate.  Only half a mile more and I should be at the hotel. But man proposes and  the Persian disposes. The carriage and fourgon were driven into a large  courtyard, the horses were unharnessed, all the luggage removed from the  fourgon and carriage, and deposited in the dust. A primitive scale was  produced and slung to a tripod, and each article weighed and weighed over  again so as to take up as much of one's time as possible. Various  expedients to impose upon me, having failed I was allowed to proceed, a  new fourgon and fresh horses being provided for the journey of half a  mile more, the obnoxious man jumping first on the box so as to prevent  being left behind.    At last the hotel was reached, and here another row arose with a  profusion of blows among a crowd of beggars who had at once collected and  disputed among themselves the right of unloading my luggage.    A strange figure appeared on the scene. A powerful, half-naked African,  as black as coal, and no less than six foot two in height. He sported a  huge wooden club in his hand, which he whirled round in a most dangerous  manner, occasionally landing it on people's skulls and backs in a  sonorous fashion. The crowd vanished, and he, now as gently as possible,  removed the luggage from the fourgon and conveyed it into the hotel.    The obnoxious man now hastily descended from his seat and demanded a  backshish.    \"What for?\"    \"Oh, sir,\" intervened a Persian gentleman present, \"this man says he has  annoyed you all the way, but he could not make you angry. He must have  backshish! He makes a living by annoying travellers!\"    In contrast to this low, depraved parasite, the African black seemed  quite a striking figure,--a scamp, if you like, yet full of character. He  was a dervish, with drunken habits and a fierce nature when under the  influence of drink, but with many good points when sober. On one occasion  an Englishman was attacked by a crowd of Persians, and was in danger of  losing his life, when this man, with considerable bravery (not to speak  of his inseparable mallet which he used freely), went to the rescue of  the sahib and succeeded in saving him. For this act of courage he has  ever since been supported by the charity of foreigners in Teheran. He  unfortunately spends all his earnings in drink, and can be very coarse  indeed, in his songs and imitations, which he delights in giving when  under the influence of liquor. He hangs round the hotel, crying out  \"_Yahu! yahu!_\" when hungry--a cry quite pathetic and"]]]
