Kal. Obitus Domini Edmundi Audeley, quondam  Sarum Episcopi, qui dedit redditum XX. Solidorum distribuendorum Canonicis  et Clericis in anniversario suo presentibus, quique capellam novam juxta  Feretrum Sancti Thomae Confessoris e fundo construxit, et in eadem  Cantariam perpetuam amortizavit, etc. Constituit necnon Feretrum argenteum  in modum Ecclesiae fabricatum atque alia quam plurima huic Sacre Edi  contulit beneficia._\"    The lower chamber is shut off from the Lady Chapel by a screen of painted  stone with open-work panelling in two stages. The chapel is a pentagon in  plan, and has two windows, while a third opens into the Lady Chapel  through the screen. The ceiling is vaulted, and bears evidences of having  in former times been elaborately painted.    There are five windows in the upper chamber, and the groined roof is  distinctly good. The boss in the centre represents the Virgin crowned in  glory. On other parts of the ceiling are the arms of Bishop Audley and  those of the Deanery as well as a shield bearing the letters R.I. The  upper part of the chantry, which is divided from the Lady Chapel by the  top of the screen which serves as a kind of rail, may have been used as an  oratory; but no remains of an altar have been found. On the door opening  on the staircase is some good iron-work, and Bishop Audley's initials may  be noticed on the lock.    Standing by the door of this chapel the visitor has a lovely view  westward, two pillars rising in the roof and across the top of the  reredos, to the right the Norman arches of the north transept, and further  on still the nave.    The Lady Chapel was used for very many years as a library, and after 1862  as the church of the parish of St. John the Baptist, which surrounds the  cathedral, and claimed to hold its service in some part of the building.    *The Crypt* is entered from the south side of the Lady Chapel where a  porch opens to a staircase leading down. The porch is deeply in-set, and  like the crypt itself and the Lady Chapel, Early English. Professor Willis  points out that Hereford is the only English cathedral whose crypt is  later in date than the eleventh century; the well-known examples at  Canterbury, Rochester, Worcester, Winchester, and Gloucester all belonging  to earlier times. A flight of twenty steps leads down to the crypt, which  is now light and dry, although previous to Dean Merewether's excavations  it was utterly neglected and nearly choked up with rubbish. There is  another approach to it from the interior of the church.                            [Illustration: THE CRYPT.]                                    THE CRYPT.    _Photochrom Co., Ld., Photo._      It is 50 feet in length, and consists of a nave and aisles marked out by  undecorated columns. It runs beneath the whole extent of the Lady Chapel.    This crypt having been used as a charnel-house is called the \"Golgotha.\"  In the centre is an altar tomb, upon which is a large and elaborately  decorated alabaster slab, in a fair state of preservation. It bears an  incised representation of Andrew Jones, a Hereford merchant, and his wife,  with an inscription setting forth how he repaired the crypt in 1497.  Scrolls proceeding from the mouths of the figures bear the following  lines:--      \"Remember thy life may not ever endure,    That thou dost thiself thereof art thou sewre.      But and thou leve thi will to other menis cure,    And thou have it after, it is but a venture.\"    At the back of the reredos is a brass to Mr. Bailey, M.P. for the county,  whose bust formerly stood here, but was removed to a more fitting position  in the county hall.    *The Vicars' Cloisters.*--The entrance to the college of Vicars Choral is  from the south side of the Lady Chapel. Leading from the south-east  transept of the cathedral to the quadrangle of the college is a long  cloister walk.    In the morning, when the sun shines upon the cloister, its richly carved  roof may be best seen. The western wall, with the exception of a few  mortuary tablets, is quite plain. The eastern wall is pierced with eight  three-light windows, between which are the remains of small niches.    Many old vicars are buried within this cloister. The roof is of oak, the  wall-plates, purlins, and rafters are richly moulded and the tie-beams and  principals are richly carved on both sides with various patterns and  devices.    The Rev. F. Havergal says:--\"The late William Cooke acquired an immense  amount of information relating to the college and the vicars in olden  time. His biographical notices of them are most curious and amusing,  giving a complete insight into the manners, traditions, and customs of the  place.\" He goes on to quote from the _Lansdowne Manuscript_ in the British  Museum, 213, p. 333.    \"Relation of a survey of twenty-six counties in 1634, by a captain, a  lieutenant, and an ancient, all three of the military company in Norwich.    \"Next came wee into a brave and ancient priviledg'd Place, through the  Lady Arbour Cloyster, close by the Chapter-house, called the Vicars  Chorall or Colledge Cloyster, where twelve of the singing men, all in  orders, most of them Masters in Arts, of a Gentile garbe, have their  convenient several dwellings, and a fayre Hall, with richly painted  windows, colledge like, wherein they constantly dyet together, and have  their cooke, butler, and other officers, with a fayre library to  themselves, consisting all of English books, wherein (after we had freely  tasted of their chorall cordiall liquor) we spent our time till the Bell  toll'd us away to Cathedral prayers. There we heard a most sweet Organ,  and voyces of all parts, Tenor, Counter-Tenor, Treble, and Base; and  amongst that orderly shewy crew of Queristers our landlord guide did act  his part in a deep and sweet Diapason.\"    *The North-East Transept.*--This transept shows ample evidence of the  original Norman plan, although its present character is Early Decorated.    Of the triple apse in which the Norman Cathedral probably terminated--an  arrangement similar to the eastern apses of Gloucester and Norwich  Cathedrals--portions remain in the walls of the vestibule to the Lady  Chapel, and in this, the north-east transept, still remain parts of the  apses which opened from the choir aisles. These are somewhat later than  the nave and belong to the Transition period.    After the completion of the great north transept for the reception of the  shrine of St. Thomas Cantilupe, the terminal apses of the choir aisles  were almost entirely removed, and the present north-east transept erected.    In the centre of this transept rises an octagonal pier which helps to  carry the quadripartite vaulting. Some Norman arches in the west wall  doubtless formed part of the original apse. The windows belong to the  Early Decorated period. Sir G. G. Scott was responsible for the  restoration of the transept.    *Monuments in the North-East Transept.*--Under the north-west window is the  canopied tomb of Bishop Swinfield. The effigy of the bishop has been lost,  and in its place, which is now shown, is an unknown figure which was found  buried in the cloisters. In the mouldings of the arched canopy the  ball-flower ornament is again in evidence, and behind the tomb a carving  of the crucifixion is still visible, though nearly obliterated by the  chisel of the Puritans. The beautiful vine leaf carving at the sides has,  however, been happily spared; it is similar to the leafage on the  Cantilupe shrine.    The altar-tomb of Dean Dawes, 1867, one of the most active of the modern  restorers, is very beautiful. It is by Sir G. G. Scott, with effigy by  Noble.    Under the north-east window is an altar-tomb of an unknown bishop. It has  been assigned to Bishop Godwen, 1633, but is probably much earlier.    There is also an old stained glass window, restored by Warrington, with  figures of SS. Catherine, Gregory, Michael, Thomas, and a modern one, by  Heaton, to the Rev. J. Goss.    In the north choir aisle, which is entered through the original Norman  arch, is an exquisite little chapel known as Bishop Stanbury's Chantry. In  style it is late Perpendicular (1470). The roof is a good specimen of  fan-vaulting, and the walls are panelled with heraldic bearings. Its  dimensions are 8 feet by 16 feet, and it is lighted by two windows on the  north side, the entrance being on the south.    At the east end are shields with emblems over the place of the altar, and  the west is covered with shields in panels and tracery.    The capitals of the shafts at the angles are formed by grotesques, and  over the arch on the south side are shields with emblems of St. Matthias,  St. Thomas, and St. Bartholomew. The Lancaster rose is prominent in the  decoration, and there is much under-cutting in the carving.    The stained windows, which form an interesting collection of arms and  legends, are in memory of Archbishop Musgrave, once Bishop of Hereford, to  whom there is also another window by Warrington in the wall of the aisle  above the chantry, which is only 11 feet in height. The subjects are taken  from the life of St. Paul.    Monument to Bishop Raynaldus, 1115, one of the chief of the Norman  builders of Hereford.    In a Perpendicular recess on the left of the door opening to the turret  staircase which leads to the archive room and chapter library is an effigy  said to be of Bishop Hugh de Mapenore, 1219. Above is a stained glass  window by Clayton and Bell, placed here as a memorial of John Hunt,  organist, who died 1842, and his nephew. There is also a small brass plate  at the side of the window, from which we learn that the nephew James died  \"of grief three days after his uncle.\"    [Illustration: VIEW BEHIND THE ALTAR, LOOKING NORTH. AFTER A DRAWING BY W.                             H. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19494"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Saint Albans (#12)"],[1," had allowed her troops to  plunder the Abbey when, in the second battle of St. Albans, she was  victorious over the Earl of Warwick.    A considerable amount of work was necessary to refit this chapel for  use. The restoration was begun by Scott and finished by Lord Grimthorpe.    Scott cut the mullions of the windows down the middle, retaining all the  part inside the glass so as to preserve the statues, but renewing the  part outside for the sake of strength. All the painted glass is modern,  the gift of various donors. Lord Grimthorpe, in place of the wooden  vaulting which was, he says, in a very unsound state, threw a stone  vault over the chapel, raising its ridge three feet higher than that of  the previous roof. All the arches of the arcade had been cut away, with  the exception of two at the east end, one on each side of the altar,  differing from each other as already mentioned. Lord Grimthorpe took as  a model the one with the cinque-foiled head, considering that the better  of the two, and constructed the existing arcading all round the chapel.  He rebuilt the Chapel of the Transfiguration, making its walls lower  than before, so as not to obstruct the view of the window over it. The  carving, chiefly the work of Mr. Baker, as already mentioned, represents  various vegetable forms in a naturalistic manner, the plants chosen  being for the most part such as grow in the neighbourhood--convolvulus,  primrose, buttercup, poppy, gooseberry, blackberry, rose, maple, ivy,  sycamore, pansy, polypody, and others.    Lord Grimthorpe also repaved the floor with marble slabs of three  colours--black, red, and white. During the time the chapel was used for  a schoolroom the floor had been a common wooden one. Practically, then,  it will be seen that this Lady Chapel, with the exception of its walls  and the windows with the statuettes on them, is a modern church,  surpassing, indeed, most nineteenth-century work in beauty, and much the  same may be said of the retro-choir or chapter-house.    #The Saint's Chapel.#--We must now return westward, through the south  aisle of the ambulatory, past the back of Duke Humphrey's grave, and  enter the Chapel of the Martyr by the door which opens into it from the  aisle. The centre of the chapel is occupied by the reconstructed  pedestal of the martyr's shrine. The ugly wooden railing that surrounds  it is a great blot on the appearance of the chapel; no doubt it is  necessary that the pedestal should be protected by some kind of barrier,  but a light and elegant railing of brass would answer every purpose  without marring the general effect, as the present cumbersome erection  shown in all the accompanying illustrations of objects in this chapel  does. It is to be hoped that either out of the general fabric fund, or  by the generosity of some individual donor, this one blot on this fine  chapel may be removed.    [Illustration: PEDESTAL OF ST. ALBAN'S SHRINE.]    The bones of St. Alban were of course counted as the chief treasure of  the Abbey, in some respects the most valuable relics in the kingdom,  since they were the bones of the first Christian martyr in the island.  It was meet and fitting, then, that the most splendid resting-place  should be chosen for them. The bones themselves were inclosed in an  outer and an inner case; the inner was the work of the sixteenth Abbot,  Geoffrey of Gorham (1119-1149), and the outer of the nineteenth Abbot,  Symeon (1167-1183). These coffers were of special metal encrusted with  rich gems. It is recorded that the reliquary was so heavy that it  required four men to carry it, which they probably did by two poles,  each passing through two rings on either side of the coffer. It is said  to have been placed in a lofty position by Abbot Symeon; but the  pedestal of which we see the reconstruction to-day was erected during  the early part of the fourteenth century, in the time of the  twenty-sixth Abbot, John de Marinis (1302-1308). This was built of  Purbeck marble and consists of a basement 2 ft. 6 in. high, 8 ft. 6 in.  long, and 3 ft. 2 in. wide, above which were four canopied niches at  each side and one at each end; these were richly painted and probably  contained other relics; in the spandrels were carved figures, at the  corners angels censing. At the west end was a representation of St.  Alban's martyrdom; on the south side in the centre was, and still is, a  figure of King Offa holding the model of a church; in the next spandrel  to the east the figure of another king; on the east side a  representation of the scourging of St. Alban, and on the north other  figures, of which the only one remaining is that of a bishop or mitred  abbot. In the pediments or gables were carvings of foliage, and round  the top of the pedestal ran a richly carved cornice; round the base  stood fourteen detached shafts, on which perhaps the movable canopy  rested, and outside three other shafts of twisted pattern on each side,  which carried six huge candles, probably kept burning day and night,  certainly during the night, to light the chamber holding the shrine. On  this lofty pedestal, 8 ft. 3 in. high, the glorious shrine rested. It  was rendered still more ornate than it was in Abbot Symeon's time by the  addition of a silver-gilt turret, on the lower part of which was a  representation of the Resurrection with two angels and four knights  (suggested by the guard of Roman soldiers) keeping the tomb. A  silver-gilt eagle of cunning craftsmanship stood on the shrine. All  these additions were given by Abbot Thomas de la Mare (1349-1396). A  certain monk also gave two representations of the sun in solid gold,  surrounded by rays of silver tipped with precious stones. Over all was a  canopy which, like many modern font-covers, was probably suspended by a  rope running over a pulley in the roof, by which it might be raised.  There is a mark in the roof remaining, possibly caused by the fastening  of the pulley. An altar, dedicated to St. Alban, stood at the west end  of the pedestal.    There are two quarry-shaped openings to be noticed on the north side of  the pedestal near the floor level, one of which extends right through to  the south side. Into these diseased arms or legs might be thrust for  cure by virtue of the saint. At the time of the dissolution the shrine  disappeared, and the marble pedestal was broken up into small fragments.  In 1847 the rector, Dr. Nicholson, found a few of these, when opening  the two northern of the blocked-up arches to the east of the chapel; and  in 1872, when the wall that closed the end of the south aisle was  removed and excavations were made to find the level of the aisle floor,  many more fragments, numbering in all about two thousand, were found.  These were carefully put together by Mr. Chapple, clerk of the works,  some plain stone being used to take the part of missing portions, with  the result that we see to-day, from which we can form some idea of the  appearance of the shrine in the days of its glory, even to the colour  decoration, for some of the fragments bear the original paint and gold.    [Illustration: WATCHING LOFT.]    Such a precious thing as this jewelled shrine and the still more  precious bones within it could not be left for a moment unguarded and  unwatched, for stealing relics, when a favourable opportunity arose, was  a temptation too great to be resisted by any monks, however holy. So on  the south side of the shrine was erected a watching loft; the one that  remains was constructed probably during the reign of Richard II., as his  badge appears on it, but, no doubt, from the first there was some such  place provided for the purpose of keeping guard. A similar loft may be  seen in the cathedral church of St. Frideswide at Oxford, and a watching  loft of a different construction in the south triforium at Malmesbury.  The chamber had two stories; the lower contained cupboards, in which  vestments and relics were kept, these are now filled with various  antiquarian curiosities, Roman pottery from Verulamium, architectural  fragments, etc. An oaken staircase leads up into the chamber where the  \"custos feretri\" sat watching the shrine day and night, guard of course  being changed at intervals. It must have been trying work watching there  during the night-time in frosty weather, but monks were accustomed to  bear cold. The watching chamber (see illustrations, pp. 66, 72) was  built of oak and was richly carved. On the south side of the cornice are  angels, the hart--badge of Richard II., the martyrdom of St. Alban, Time  the reaper, and the seasons; on the north the months of the year are  represented.    The west side of this chapel is closed by the back of Wallingford's  screen, on which may be seen five statues representing St. Peter, St.  John, St. Mary, St. Stephen, and St. Michael. The eastern side is closed  by a low wall, erected by Lord Grimthorpe in place of the wall by which  these arches were completely blocked up after the dissolution. It was  here that some of the fragments of the pedestal were found. Into his new  wall Lord Grimthorpe has built some old fragments of carved work found  in different places of the church.    The south side of this chapel is formed of the monument over the grave  of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, surnamed \"good\" by an admiring people,  though some modern historians hold that he had little real claim to this  title. He was the son of Henry IV., and therefore brother of Henry V.,  and was uncle of Henry VI. and guardian to the young King in the early  part of his reign. He who likes may read in any history of the part he  played in the affairs of the country: how he incurred the hatred of the  unscrupulous and vindictive Queen of Henry VI., Margaret of Anjou,  \"she-wolf of France\"; how he was murdered by Suffolk, with, it is said,  the connivance of the Queen and Cardinal Beaufort. It was at one time  supposed that he was buried in London,"]]]
