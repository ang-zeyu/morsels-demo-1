She went to the priest, offered him a large sum  of money, and induced him to let her go to the palace instead. So  Ileane arrived at the court disguised as a priest.    When she approached the prince's bed he was at the point of death,  there were scarcely three breaths left in him.    \"My son,\" said the false priest, Ileane, \"you have summoned me to  confess your sins to me. Think of the hour of death, and tell me all  you have on your heart. Are you at variance with any one? Yes, or no?\"    \"With no one,\" replied the prince, \"except Ileane, the youngest  daughter of the emperor, our neighbor. And I hate her out of love and  longing,\" he continued. \"If I should not die, but recover, I will ask  the emperor for her hand in marriage, and if I don't kill her the  first night she shall be my faithful wife according to the law.\"  Ileane heard these words, said a few in reply, and then went home.  Here she soon understood why her sisters were wailing and lamenting,  for they had heard that the emperor was returning home from the great  war.    \"You ought to rejoice,\" said Ileane, \"when you hear that our kind  father is coming home safe and well.\"    \"We should rejoice,\" replied the sisters, \"if our flowers had not  withered, our apples had not rotted, and our birds had not stopped  singing; but now we have reason to cry.\"    When Ileane heard these words she went to her room, saw the flower  sprinkled with dew, the bird hungry, and the apple looking as if it  wanted to say: \"Eat me, little sister!\"    So, to help her dear sisters, she gave the flower to one and the bird  to the other, keeping only the beautiful apple for herself. So they  waited for the arrival of the emperor, who was very stern in his  commands.    When the monarch reached home, he approached his oldest daughter and  asked for the flower, the bird, and the apple. She showed him nothing  but the flower, and even that was half withered. The emperor said  nothing, but went to his second daughter. She showed him only the  little bird, and that, too, looked drooping. Again the emperor did not  speak, but silently went up to his youngest daughter, clever Ileane.    When the emperor saw the apple on Ileane's chest of drawers he could  almost have devoured it with his eyes, it was so beautiful. \"Where did  you put the flower, and what have you done with the bird?\" he asked  Ileane.    Ileane did not answer, but hurried to her sisters and brought back a  fresh flower and a merry little bird.    \"May you prosper, my little daughter,\" said the emperor; \"I see now  that you have kept faith with me.\"    From Ileane the emperor went to his second daughter, and then to the  eldest one.    When he questioned them about the three things he had trusted to their  care, they hastily brought Ileane's flower, bird, and apple. But as  God permits no falsehood to succeed, in their hands the flower  withered, the bird moped, and only the apple remained fresh,  rosy-cheeked, and eatable.    When the emperor saw this he understood every thing, and ordered the  two older princesses to be buried to their breasts in the earth, and  left there that they might be an example of the severity of an  imperial punishment. But Ileane he praised, kissed, spoke to her in  kind, fatherly words, and said: \"May you have much happiness, my  child, for you have been faithful to your duty.\"    After the neighboring emperor's son had recovered, he mounted his  horse and set off to ask Ileane to be his wife. The old emperor,  Ileane's father, after hearing for what purpose the prince had come,  said to him kindly:    \"Go and ask Ileane, my son and hero; whatever she wishes shall, with  God's help, be done.\"    Ileane said nothing, but permitted the prince to kiss her. The emperor  instantly understood the whole matter and said: \"My dear children, I  see that you ought to be husband and wife; may it prove for your  good.\"    It was not long before Ileane married the bold, handsome, heroic  youth. Her wedding was so magnificent that tidings of it spread  through seven countries. Yes indeed! But Ileane had not forgotten the  evil the prince had in his mind; she knew that he would try some trick  upon her the first night after their marriage. So she ordered a sugar  doll to be made exactly the same size as she was herself, with face,  eyes, lips, and figure precisely like Ileane's. When it was finished,  she hid it in the bed where she was to sleep that night.    In the evening, when the relatives and friends had gone to rest and  Ileane, too, had been asleep, the prince said to his bride:    \"Dear Ileane, wait a little while, I'll come back directly.\" Then he  left the room.    Ileane did not hesitate long, but jumped out of bed, left the sugar  doll in her place, and hid behind a curtain at the head of the bed.    She had scarcely concealed herself, when the prince returned to the  chamber with a sharp sword in his hand.    \"Tell me now, my dear Ileane,\" he said, \"did you throw me into the  cellar?\"    \"Yes,\" said Ileane, behind the curtain. The prince dealt one blow with  the sword on the doll's breast.    \"Did you drive me out of the country with scorn and mockery?\" he asked  again.    \"Yes,\" said Ileane.    The prince cut the doll across her face.    \"Did you empty my dishes of food?\" asked the prince the third time.    \"Yes,\" said Ileane.    The prince slashed the doll from head to foot.    \"Did you pour out my wine?\" was the prince's fourth question.    \"Yes,\" said Ileane.    The prince cut the figure once across. Ileane began to breathe heavily  as if in the agony of death.    \"Did you throw me among the knives?\" he asked for the fifth and last  question.    \"Yes,\" said Ileane.    The prince now thrust his sword into the figure's heart, slashed, and  hacked it in all directions, with all his strength, till the tears ran  down in streams. As dawn approached he began to sob bitterly. Suddenly  a bit of sugar popped into his mouth.    \"Ah, Ileane! you were sweet in life, and remain sweet even in death,\"  he said, weeping still more violently.    \"Sweet indeed,\" said Ileane, coming out from behind the curtain, \"but  from this hour forth I will be a hundred thousand times sweeter.\"    The prince seemed fairly petrified with delight, when he saw Ileane  safe and well. He clasped her in his arms, and for many years they  lived joyously and ruled the land in peace and happiness.          The Princess and the Fisherman.      Once upon a time something happened. If it had not happened, it would  not be told.    There was once a fisherman, neither very well off nor very poor, but  he was young, with a mustache that curled fiercely at the ends, you  know, and a fine-looking fellow. Whenever he passed the imperial  palace, the emperor's daughter sent for him, bought his fish, and gave  him ten times as much money as they were worth.    Our fisherman was spoiled by this wealth, and whenever he had nice  fresh fish he took them to the palace; not a day passed that the  princess did not buy fish if the fisherman went by.    One day, while paying for the fish, the princess pressed his hand, the  fisherman blushed as red as a beet, and cast down his eyes, but first  gave her one loving glance, for he had understood that she was willing  he should do so.    Then he entered into conversation with her, and took good care not to  say any thing stupid.    The next time the princess bought fish he began to talk about them at  great length, and made her comprehend that he had understood her  feelings, and that the fire of love which was consuming her burned no  less hotly in his heart than in her own.    Another time he spoke still more freely, and the princess learned that  he was unmarried; she was, besides, much pleased with his clever  answers, and as he was very attractive the royal maiden finally fell  in love with him. She gave him a purse filled with money to purchase  handsome clothes, and told him to come back afterward and show himself  to her.    After he had bought garments like those worn by gentlemen, he put them  on and returned to the princess. She would scarcely have recognized  him, for even his gait and bearing had become as stiff as a noble's.    At last, unable to repress the love that glowed in her heart, the  emperor's daughter told him that she would marry him.    The fisherman did not know much, but he was aware that such a dainty  morsel wasn't meant for his bill, and he could hardly believe what he  heard with his ears and saw with his eyes; but when the princess  assured him that she wasn't joking, he accepted her hand, though to  tell the truth with many doubts and blushes.    The marriage did not exactly suit the emperor, but as he loved his  daughter and she was her parents' only child, he yielded to her  wishes. The princess gave the fisherman another purse filled with  money, and told him to buy himself still handsomer clothes. When he  returned, in garments that fairly glittered with gold, the royal  maiden presented him to the emperor, and the monarch betrothed them to  each other.    Ere long a magnificent imperial wedding was celebrated. When the  company sat down to enjoy the banquet, a soft-boiled egg, which,  according to ancient custom, only the bride and bridegroom were  permitted to eat, was brought to the wedded pair. When the husband was  about to dip a bit of bread into the egg, the princess stopped him,  saying: \"I must dip first, because I am the daughter of an emperor,  and you are a fisherman.\" The bridegroom made no reply, but rose from  the table and vanished. The guests, who did not know what had  happened, looked at one another and asked in surprise what this meant,  for they had not heard that the emperor's son-in-law had formerly been  a fisherman.    The bride repented her imprudence, bit her lips, and wrung her hands.  She ate what she was compelled to swallow, but she might"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20556"],[0,"Lamarck, the Founder of Evolution (#12)"],[1," been no permission granted to purchase    a burial lot. The bones of Lamarck are probably at this moment mixed    with those of all the other unknown which lie there. What had at    first led us into an error is that we made the inquiries under the    name of Lamarck instead of that of de Monnet. In reality, the    register of inscription bears the following mention:      \"'De Monnet de Lamarck buried this 20 December 1829 (85 years), 3d    square, 1st division, 2d line, trench 22.'      \"At some period later, a friendly hand, without doubt, had written    on the margin of the register the following information:      \"'To the left of M. Dassas.'      \"M. Lacave kindly went with us to search for the place where Lamarck    had been interred, and on the register we saw this:      \"'Dassas, 1st division, 4th line south, No. 6 to the west,    concession 1165-1829.' On arriving at the spot designated, we found    some new graves, but nothing to indicate that of M. Dassas, our only    mark by which we could trace the site after the changes wrought    since 1829. After several ineffectual attempts, I finally perceived    a flat grave, surrounded by an iron railing, and covered with weeds.    Its surface seemed to me very regular, and I probed this lot. There    was a gravestone there. The grave-digger who accompanied us cleared    away the surface, and I confess that it was with the greatest    pleasure and with deep emotion that we read the name Dassas.    [Illustration: POSITION OF THE BURIAL PLACE OF LAMARCK IN THE CEMETERY  OF MONTPARNASSE.]      \"We found the place, but unfortunately, as I have previously said,    the remains of Lamarck are no longer there.\"    Mondiere added to his letter a little plan (p. 59), which he drew on the  spot.[47]    But the life-work of Lamarck and his theory of organic evolution, as  well as the lessons of his simple and noble character, are more durable  and lasting than any monument of stone or brass. His name will never be  forgotten either by his own countrymen or by the world of science and  philosophy. After the lapse of nearly a hundred years, and in this first  year of the twentieth century, his views have taken root and flourished  with a surprising strength and vigor, and his name is preeminent among  the naturalists of his time.    No monument exists in Montparnasse, but within the last decade, though  the reparation has come tardily, the bust of Lamarck may be seen by  visitors to the Jardin des Plantes, on the outer wall of the Nouvelle  Galerie, containing the Museums of Comparative Anatomy, Palaeontology,  and Anthropology.    Although the city of Paris has not yet erected a monument to its  greatest naturalist, some public recognition of his eminent services to  the city and nation was manifested when the Municipal Council of Paris,  on February 10, 1875, gave the name Lamarck to a street.[48] This is a  long and not unimportant street on the hill of Montmartre in the XVIII^e  _arrondissement_, and in the zone of the old stone or gypsum quarries  which existed before Paris extended so far out in that direction, and  from which were taken the fossil remains of the early tertiary mammals  described by Cuvier.    The city of Toulouse has also honored itself by naming one of its  streets after Lamarck; this was due to the proposal of Professor Emile  Cartailhac to the Municipal Council, which voted to this effect May 12,  1886.    In the meetings of the Assembly of Professors no one took the trouble to  prepare and enter minutes, however brief and formal, relative to his  decease. The death of Lamarck is not even referred to in the  _Proces-verbaux_. This is the more marked because there is an entry in  the same records for 1829, and about the same date, of an extraordinary  _seance_ held November 19, 1829, when \"the Assembly\" was convoked to  take measures regarding the death of Professor Vauquelin relative to the  choice of a candidate, Chevreul being elected to fill his chair.    Lamarck's chair was at his death divided, and the two professorships  thus formed were given to Latreille and De Blainville.    At the session of the Assembly of Professors held December 8, 1829,  Geoffroy St. Hilaire sent in a letter to the Assembly urging that the  department of invertebrate animals be divided into two, and referred to  the bad state of preservation of the insects, the force of assistants to  care for these being insufficient. He also, in his usual tactful way,  referred to the \"_complaisance extreme de la parte de M. De Lamarck_\" in  1793, in assenting to the reunion in a single professorship of the mass  of animals then called \"_insectes et vermes_.\"    The two successors of the chair held by Lamarck were certainly not  dilatory in asking for appointments. At a session of the Professors held  December 22, 1829, the first meeting after his death, we find the  following entry: \"M. Latreille ecrit pour exprimer son desir d'etre  presente comme candidat a la chaire vacante par le deces de M. Lamarck  et pour rappeler ses titres a cette place.\"    M. de Blainville also wrote in the same manner: \"Dans le cas que la  chaire serait divisee, il demande la place de Professeur de l'histoire  des animaux inarticules. Dans le cas contraire il se presente egalement  comme candidat, voulant, tout en respectant les droits acquis, ne pas  laisser dans l'oubli ceux qui lui appartiennent.\"    January 12, 1830, Latreille[49] was unanimously elected by the Assembly  a candidate to the chair of entomology, and at a following session  (February 16th) De Blainville was unanimously elected a candidate for  the chair of _Molluscs, Vers et Zoophytes_, and on the 16th of March the  royal ordinance confirming those elections was received by the Assembly.    There could have been no fitter appointments made for those two  positions. Lamarck had long known Latreille \"and loved him as a son.\" De  Blainville honored and respected Lamarck, and fully appreciated his  commanding abilities as an observer and thinker.

Nat. des  Crustaces_ (1828), and papers on insects and plants. He was associated  with Lamarck in the publication of the _Journal d'Histoire Naturelle_.  During the Reign of Terror in 1793 he was a friend of Madame Roland, was  arrested, but afterwards set free and placed first on the Directory in  1795. In 1798 he sailed for Charleston, S. C. Nominated successively  vice-consul at Wilmington and consul at New York, but not obtaining his  exequatur from President Adams, he went to live with the botanist  Michaux in Carolina in his botanical garden, where he devoted himself to  natural history until the quarrel in 1800 between the United States and  France caused him to return to France. On his return he sent North  American insects to his friends Fabricius and Olivier, fishes to  Lacepede, birds to Daudin, reptiles to Latreille. Not giving all his  time to public life, he devoted himself to natural history,  horticulture, and agriculture, succeeding Thouin in the chair of  horticulture, where he was most usefully employed until his  death.--(Cuvier's _Eloge_.)    [43] The first director of the Board or Assembly of  Professors-administrative of the Museum was Daubenton, Lacepede being  the secretary, Thouin the treasurer. Daubenton was succeeded by Jussieu;  and Lacepede, first by Desfontaines and afterwards by Lamarck, who was  elected secretary 18 fructidor, an II. (1794).    [44] His attendance this year was infrequent. July 10, 1820, he was  present and made a report relative to madrepores and molluscs. In the  summer of 1821 he attended several of the meetings. August 7, 1821, he  was present, and referred to the collection of shells of Struthiolaria.  He was present May 23d and June 9th, when it was voted that he should  enjoy the garden of the house he occupied and that a chamber should be  added to his lodgings. He was frequent in attendance this year,  especially during the summer months. He attended a few meetings at  intervals in 1822, 1823, and only twice in 1824.    At a meeting held April 19, 1825, he was present, and, stating that his  condition did not permit him to lecture, asked to have Audouin take his  place, as Latreille's health did not allow him to take up the work. The  next week (26th) he was likewise present. On May 10 he was present, as  also on June 28, October 11, and also through December, 1825. His last  appearance at these business meetings was on July 11, 1828.    [45] See, for the _Acte de deces_, _L'Homme_, iv. p. 289, and _Lamarck.  Par un Groupe de Transformistes_, etc., p. 24.
