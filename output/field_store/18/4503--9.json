(#12)"],[1,"the business of others to examine who had the  best pretensions, either by the laws or by right of blood, to the  succession: that she hoped the claim of the queen of Scots would then be  found solid; and, considering the injury which she herself had received,  it was sufficient indulgence if she promised, in the mean time, to do  nothing which might in any respect weaken or invalidate it: and that  Mary, if her title were really preferable--a point which, for her own  part, she had never inquired into--possessed all advantages above her  rivals; who, destitute both of present power and of all support by  friends, would only expose themselves to inevitable ruin, by advancing  any weak, or even doubtful pretensions.[*]    These views of the queen were so prudent and judicious, that there was  no likelihood of her ever departing from them: but that she might put  the matter to a fuller proof, she offered to explain the words of the  treaty of Edinburgh, so as to leave no suspicion of their excluding  Mary's right of succession;[**] and in this form she again required her  to ratify that treaty. Matters at last came to this issue, that Mary  agreed to the proposal, and offered to renounce all present pretensions  to the crown of England, provided Elizabeth would agree to declare her  the successor.[***] But such was the jealous character of this latter  princess, that she never would consent to strengthen the interest and  authority of any claimant by fixing the succession; much less would  she make this concession in favor of a rival queen, who possessed  such plausible pretensions for the present, and who, though she might  verbally renounce them, could easily resume her claim on the first  opportunity.         * Buchanan, lib. xvii. c. 14-17.

Mary's proposal, however, bore so specious an appearance of equity and  justice, that Elizabeth, sensible that reason would, by superficial  thinkers, be deemed to lie entirely on that side, made no more mention  of the matter; and though further concessions were never made by either  princess, they put on all the appearances of a cordial reconciliation  and friendship with each other.    The queen observed that, even without her interposition, Mary was  sufficiently depressed by the mutinous spirit of her own subjects;  and instead of giving Scotland for the present any inquietude or  disturbance, she employed herself, more usefully and laudably, in  regulating the affairs of her own kingdom, and promoting the happiness  of her people. She made some progress in paying those great debts which  lay upon the crown; she regulated the coin, which had been much debased  by her predecessors; she furnished her arsenals with great quantities of  arms from Germany and other places; engaged her nobility and gentry to  imitate her example in this particular; introduced into the kingdom the  art of making gunpowder and brass cannon; fortified her frontiers on  the side of Scotland; made frequent reviews of the militia; encouraged  agriculture, by allowing a free exportation of corn; promoted trade and  navigation; and so much increased the shipping of her kingdom, both by  building vessels of force herself, and suggesting like undertakings to  the merchants, that she was justly styled the restorer of naval glory,  and the queen of the northern seas.[*] The natural frugality of her  temper, so far from incapacitating her for these great enterprises, only  enabled her to execute them with greater certainty and success; and  all the world, saw in her conduct the happy effects of a vigorous  perseverance in judicious and well-concerted projects.         * Camden, p. 388. Strype, vol. i. p. 230, 336, 337.    It is easy to imagine that so great a princess, who enjoyed such  singular felicity and renown, would receive proposals of marriage from  every one that had any likelihood of succeeding; and though she had made  some public declarations in favor of a single life, few believed that  she would persevere forever in that resolution. The archduke Charles,  second son of the emperor,[*] as well as Casimir, son of the elector  palatine, made applications to her; and as this latter prince professed  the reformed religion, he thought himself, on that account, better  entitled to succeed in his addresses. Eric, king of Sweden, and Adolph,  duke of Holstein, were encouraged by the same views to become suitors:  and the earl of Arran, heir to the crown of Scotland, was, by the states  of that kingdom, recommended to her as a suitable marriage.         * Haynes, vol. i. p. 233.    Even some of her own subjects, though they did not openly declare their  pretensions, entertained hopes of success. The earl of Arundel, a person  declining in years, but descended from an ancient and noble family, as  well as possessed of great riches, flattered himself with this prospect;  as did also Sir William Pickering, a man much esteemed for his personal  merit. But the person most likely to succeed, was a younger son of the  late duke of Northumberland, Lord Robert Dudley, who, by means of his  exterior qualities, joined to address and flattery, had become in  a manner her declared favorite, and had great influence in all her  counsels. The less worthy he appeared of this distinction, the more was  his great favor ascribed to some violent affection, which could thus  seduce the judgment of this penetrating princess; and men long expected  that he would obtain the preference above so many princes and monarchs.  But the queen gave all these suitors a gentle refusal, which still  encouraged their pursuit; and thought that she should the better attach  them to her interest, if they were still allowed to entertain hopes of  succeeding in their pretensions. It is also probable that this policy  was not entirely free from a mixture of female coquetry; and that,  though she was determined in her own mind never to share her power with  any man, she was not displeased with the courtship, solicitation, and  professions of love, which the desire of acquiring so valuable a prize  procured her from all quarters.    What is most singular in the conduct and character of Elizabeth is, that  though she determined never to have any heir of her own body, she was  not only very averse to fix any successor to the crown, but seems, also,  to have resolved, as far as it lay in her power, that no one who had  pretensions to the succession should ever have any heirs or successors.  If the exclusion given by the will of Henry VIII. to the posterity of  Margaret, queen of Scotland, was allowed to be valid, the right to the  crown devolved on the house of Suffolk; and the lady Catharine Gray,  younger sister to the lady Jane, was now the heir of that family. This  lady had been married to Lord Herbert, son of the earl of Pembroke; but  having been divorced from that nobleman, she had made a private marriage  with the earl of Hertford, son of the protector; and her husband, soon  after consummation, travelled into France. In a little time she appeared  to be pregnant, which so enraged Elizabeth, that she threw her into  the Tower, and summoned Hertford to appear, in order to answer for his  misdemeanor. He made no scruple of acknowledging the marriage, which,  though concluded without the queen's consent, was entirely suitable to  both parties; and for this offence he was also committed to the Tower.  Elizabeth's severity stopped not here: she issued a commission to  inquire into the matter; and as Hertford could not, within the time  limited, prove the nuptials by witnesses, the commerce between him and  his consort was declared unlawful, and their posterity illegitimate.  They were still detained in custody, but by bribing their keepers, they  found means to have further intercourse; and another child appeared to  be the fruit of their commerce. This was a fresh source of vexation to  the queen; who made a fine of fifteen thousand pounds be set on Hertford  by the star chamber and ordered his confinement to be thenceforth more  rigid and severe. He lay in this condition for nine years, till the  death of his wife, by freeing Elizabeth from all fears, procured him his  liberty.[*] This extreme severity must be accounted for, either by the  unrelenting jealousy of the queen, who was afraid lest a pretender  to the succession should acquire credit by having issue; or by her  malignity, which, with all her great qualities, made one ingredient  in her character, and which led her to envy in others those natural  pleasures of love and posterity, of which her own ambition and desire of  dominion made her renounce all prospect for herself.         * Haynes, vol. i. p. 369, 378, 396. Camden, p. 389. Heylin,       p. 154.    There happened, about this time, some other events in the royal family  where the queen's conduct was more laudable. Arthur Pole and his  brother, nephews to the late cardinal, and descended from the duke of  Clarence, together with Anthony Fortescue, who had married a sister of  these gentlemen, and some other persons, were brought to their trial  for intending to withdraw into France, with a view of soliciting  succors from the duke of Guise, of returning thence into Wales, and of  proclaiming Mary queen of England, and Arthur Pole duke of Clarence.  They confessed the indictment, but asserted that they never meant to  execute these projects during the queen's lifetime: they had only deemed  such precautions requisite in case of her demise, which some pretenders  to judicial astrology had assured them they might with certainty look  for before the year expired. They were condemned by the jury; but  received a pardon from the queen's clemency.[*]         * Strype, vol. i. p. 333. Heylin, p. 154.          CHAPTER XXXIX.          ELIZABETH.    {1562.} After the commencement of the religious wars in France,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19215"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part E. (#12)"],[1,"the considerable officers of the crown; in the whole,  thirty-three. By this commission, which, from the number of persons  named in it, could be no secret, the commissioners were empowered to  meet, and to concert among themselves the methods of levying money by  impositions, or otherwise; \"Where form and circumstance,\" as expressed  in the commission, \"must be dispensed with, rather than the substance  be lost or hazarded.\"[*] In other words, this was a scheme for finding  expedients which might raise the prerogative to the greatest height, and  render parliaments entirely useless. The commons applied for cancelling  the commission;[**] and were, no doubt, desirous that all the world  should conclude the king's principles to be extremely arbitrary,  and should observe what little regard he was disposed to pay to the  liberties and privileges of his people.         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 614. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 214.         ** Journ. 13th June, 1628.    A commission had likewise been granted, and some money remitted, in  order to raise a thousand German horse, and transport them into England.  These were supposed to be levied in order to support the projected  impositions or excises, though the number seems insufficient for such a  purpose,[*] The house took notice of this design in severe terms: and no  measure, surely, could be projected more generally odious to the whole  nation. It must, however, be confessed, that the king was so far  right, that he had now at last fallen on the only effectual method for  supporting his prerogative. But at the same time, he should have been  sensible that, till provided with a sufficient military force, all his  attempts in opposition to the rising spirit of the nation, must in  the end prove wholly fruitless; and that the higher he screwed up the  springs of government, while he had so little real power to retain them  in that forced situation, with more fatal violence must they fly out,  when any accident occurred to restore them to their natural action.    The commons next resumed their censure of Buckingham's conduct and  behavior, against whom they were implacable. They agreed to present  a remonstrance to the king, in which they recapitulated all national  grievances and misfortunes, and omitted no circumstance which could  render the whole administration despicable and odious. The compositions  with Catholics, they said, amounted to no less than a toleration,  hateful to God, full of dishonor and disprofit to his majesty, and of  extreme scandal and grief to his good people: they took notice of the  violations of liberty above mentioned, against which the petition of  right seems to have provided a sufficient remedy: they mentioned the  decay of trade, the unsuccessful expeditions to Cadiz and the Isle  of Rhe, the encouragement given to Arminians, the commission for  transporting German horse, that for levying illegal impositions; and all  these grievances they ascribed solely to the ill conduct of the duke of  Buckingham.[**] This remonstrance was, perhaps, not the less provoking  to Charles, because, joined to the extreme acrimony of the subject,  there were preserved in it, as in most of the remonstrances of that age,  an affected civility and submission in the language. And as it was the  first return which he met with for his late beneficial concessions, and  for his sacrifices of prerogative,--the greatest by far ever made by an  English sovereign,--nothing could be more the object of just and natural  indignation.         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 612.         ** Rushworth, vol. i. p. 619. Parl. Hist. vol viii. p. 219,       220, etc.    It was not without good grounds that the commons were so fierce and  assuming. Though they had already granted the king the supply of five  subsidies, they still retained a pledge in their hands, which they  thought insured them success in all their applications. Tonnage and  poundage had not yet been granted by parliament; and the commons had  artfully, this session, concealed their intention of invading that  branch of revenue, till the royal assent had been obtained to the  petition of right, which they justly deemed of such importance. They  then openly asserted, that the levying of tonnage and poundage without  consent of parliament, was a palpable violation of the ancient liberties  of the people, and an open infringement of the petition of right, so  lately granted.[*] The king, in order to prevent the finishing and  presenting this remonstrance, came suddenly to the parliament, and ended  this session by a prorogation.[**]         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 628. Journ. 18th 20th June, 1628.         ** Journ, 26th June, 1628.    Being freed for some time from the embarrassment of this assembly,  Charles began to look towards foreign wars, where all his efforts were  equally unsuccessful as in his domestic government. The earl of Denbigh,  brother-in-law to Buckingham, was despatched to the relief of Rochelle,  now closely besieged by land, and threatened with a blockade by sea: but  he returned without effecting any thing; and having declined to attack  the enemy's fleet, he brought on the English arms the imputation either  of cowardice or ill conduct. In order to repair this dishonor, the duke  went to Portsmouth, where he had prepared a considerable fleet and army,  on which all the subsidies given by parliament had been expended. This  supply had very much disappointed the king's expectations. The same  mutinous spirit which prevailed in the house of commons had diffused  itself over the nation; and the commissioners appointed for making the  assessments had connived at all frauds which might diminish the supply,  and reduce the crown to still greater necessities. This national  discontent, communicated to a desperate enthusiast, soon broke out in an  event which may be considered as remarkable.    There was one Felton, of a good family, but of an ardent, melancholic  temper, who had served under the duke in the station of lieutenant.  His captain being killed in the retreat at the Isle of Rhe, Felton  had applied for the company; and when disappointed, he threw up his  commission, and retired in discontent from the army. While private  resentment was boiling in his sullen, unsociable mind, he heard the  nation resound with complaints against the duke; and he met with the  remonstrance of the commons, in which his enemy was represented as the  cause of every national grievance, and as the great enemy of the public.  Religious fanaticism further inflamed these vindictive reflections; and  he fancied that he should do Heaven acceptable service, if at one blow  he despatched this dangerous foe to religion and to his country.[*] Full  of these dark views, he secretly arrived at Portsmouth at the same time  with the duke, and watched for an opportunity of effecting his bloody  purpose.         * May's Hist. of the Parliament, p. 12.    Buckingham had been engaged in conversation with Soubize and other  French gentlemen; and a difference of sentiment having arisen, the  dispute, though conducted with temper and decency, had produced some of  those vehement gesticulations and lively exertions of voice, in which  that nation, more than the English, are apt to indulge themselves. The  conversation being finished, the duke drew towards the door; and in that  passage, turning himself to speak to Sir Thomas Friar, a colonel in the  army, he was on the sudden, over Sir Thomas's shoulder, struck upon the  breast with a knife. Without uttering other words than, \"The villain has  killed me,\" in the same moment pulling out the knife, he breathed his  last.    No man had seen the blow, nor the person who gave it, but in the  confusion every one made his own conjecture; and all agreed that the  murder had been committed by the French gentlemen whose angry tone of  voice had been heard, while their words had not been understood by the  bystanders. In the hurry of revenge, they had instantly been put to  death, had they not been saved by some of more temper and judgment,  who, though they had the same opinion of their guilt, thought proper to  reserve them for a judicial trial and examination.    Near the door there was found a hat, in the inside of which was sewed a  paper, containing four or five lines of that remonstrance of the commons  which declared Buckingham an enemy to the kingdom; and under these lines  was a short ejaculation, or attempt towards a prayer. It was easily  concluded that this hat belonged to the assassin: but the difficulty  still remained, who that person should be; for the writing discovered  not the same; and whoever he was, it was natural to believe that he had  already fled far enough not to be found without a hat.    In this hurry, a man without a hat was seen walking very composedly  before the door. One crying out, \"Here is the fellow who killed the  duke;\" every body ran to ask, \"Which is he?\" The man very sedately  answered, \"I am he.\" The more furious immediately rushed upon him with  drawn swords: others, more deliberate, defended and protected him: he  himself, with open arms, calmly and cheerfully exposed his breast to the  swords of the most enraged; being willing to fall a sudden sacrifice to  their anger, rather than be reserved for that public justice which he  knew must be executed upon him.    He was now known to be that Felton who had served in the army. Being  carried into a private room, it was thought proper so far to dissemble  as to tell him, that Buckingham was only grievously wounded, but not  without hopes of recovery. Felton smiled, and told them, that the duke,  he knew full well, had received a blow which had terminated all their  hopes. When asked at whose instigation he had performed the horrid deed,  he replied, that they needed not to trouble themselves in that inquiry;  that no man living had credit enough with him to have disposed him to  such an action; that he"]]]
