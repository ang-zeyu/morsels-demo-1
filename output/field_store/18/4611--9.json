The excitement in  Bohemia was intense. For a while it seemed as though Martin Luther would  wield as great an influence there as ever he had in Germany. For a while  the Utraquist priests themselves, like Rockycana of yore, thundered in  a hundred pulpits against the Church of Rome; and Luther, taking the  keenest interest in the growing movement, wrote a letter to the Bohemian  Diet, and urged the ecclesiastical leaders in Prague to break the last  fetters that bound them to Rome.    For a while his agent, Gallus Cahera, a butcher's son, who had studied  at Wittenberg, was actually pastor of the Thein Church {1523-9.},  referred in his sermons to the \"celebrated Dr. Martin Luther,\" and  openly urged the people to pray for that \"great man of God.\" For a while  even a preacher of the Brethren, named Martin, was allowed to stand  where Hus had stood, and preach in the Bethlehem Church. For a while, in  a word, it seemed to the Brethren that the Reformation now spreading in  Germany would conquer Bohemia at a rush. The great Luther was loved by  many classes. He was loved by the Utraquists because he had burned the  Pope's Bull. He was loved by the young because he favoured learning. He  was loved by the Brethren because he upheld the Bible as the standard  of faith {1522.}. As soon as Luther had left the Wartburg, the Brethren  boldly held out to him the right hand of fellowship; sent two German  Brethren, John Horn and Michael Weiss, to see him; presented him with a  copy of their Confession and Catechism; began a friendly correspondence  on various points of doctrine and discipline, and thus opened their  hearts to hear with respect what the great Reformer had to say.    Amid these bright prospects Luke of Prague breathed his last {Dec. 11th,  1528.}. As Gregory the Patriarch had gone to his rest when a new party  was rising among the Brethren, so Luke of Prague crossed the cold river  of death when new ideas from Germany were stirring the hearts of his  friends. He was never quite easy in his mind about Martin Luther.  He still believed in the Seven Sacraments. He still believed in the  Brethren's system of stern moral discipline. He still believed, for  practical reasons, in the celibacy of the clergy. \"This eating,\" he  wrote, \"this drinking, this self-indulgence, this marrying, this living  to the world--what a poor preparation it is for men who are leaving  Babylon. If a man does this he is yoking himself with strangers.  Marriage never made anyone holy yet. It is a hindrance to the higher  life, and causes endless trouble.\" Above all, he objected to Luther's  way of teaching the great doctrine of justification by faith.    \"Never, never,\" he said, in a letter to Luther, \"can you ascribe a man's  salvation to faith alone. The Scriptures are against you. You think that  in this you are doing a good work, but you are really fighting against  Christ Himself and clinging to an error.\" He regarded Luther's teaching  as extreme and one-sided. He was shocked by what he heard of the jovial  life led by Luther's students at Wittenberg, and could never understand  how a rollicking youth could be a preparation for a holy ministry.  As Gregory the Patriarch had warned Matthias against \"the learned  Brethren,\" so Luke, in his turn, now warned the Brethren against  the loose lives of Luther's merry-hearted students; and, in order  to preserve the Brethren's discipline, he now issued a comprehensive  treatise, divided into two parts--the first entitled \"Instructions  for Priests,\" and the second \"Instructions and Admonitions for all  occupations, all ages in life, all ranks and all sorts of characters.\"  As he lay on his death-bed at Jungbunzlau, his heart was stirred by  mingled feelings. There was land in sight--ah, yes!--but what grew upon  the enchanting island? He would rather see his Church alone and pure  than swept away in the Protestant current. Happy was he in the day of  his death. So far he had steered the Church safely. He must now resign  his post to another pilot who knew well the coming waters.          CHAPTER VII. -- THE BRETHREN AT HOME.    As we have now arrived at that bend in the lane, when the Brethren, no  longer marching alone, became a regiment in the conquering Protestant  army, it will be convenient to halt in our story and look at the  Brethren a little more closely--at their homes, their trades, their  principles, their doctrines, their forms of service, and their life from  day to day. After all, what were these Brethren, and how did they live?    They called themselves Jednota Bratrska--i.e., the Church of the  Brethren. As this word \"Jednota\" means union, and is used in this sense  in Bohemia at the present day, it is possible that the reader may think  that instead of calling the Brethren a Church, we ought rather to call  them the Union or Unity of the Brethren. If he does, however, he will  be mistaken. We have no right to call the Brethren a mere Brotherhood  or Unity. They regarded themselves as a true apostolic Church. They  believed that their episcopal orders were valid. They called the Church  of Rome a Jednota;[24] they called the Lutheran Church a Jednota;[25] they  called themselves a Jednota; and, therefore, if the word Jednota means  Church when applied to Lutherans and Roman Catholics, it must also mean  Church when applied to the Bohemian Brethren. It is not correct to  call them the Unitas Fratrum. The term is misleading. It suggests a  Brotherhood rather than an organized Church. We have no right to call  them a sect; the term is a needless insult to their memory.[26] As the  Brethren settled in the Valley of Kunwald, the great object which they  set before them was to recall to vigorous life the true Catholic Church  of the Apostles; and as soon as they were challenged by their enemies to  justify their existence, they replied in good set terms.    \"Above all things,\" declared the Brethren, at a Synod held in 1464, \"we  are one in this purpose. We hold fast the faith of the Lord Christ. We  will abide in the righteousness and love of God. We will trust in the  living God. We will do good works. We will serve each other in the  spirit of love. We will lead a virtuous, humble, gentle, sober, patient  and pure life; and thereby shall we know that we hold the faith in  truth, and that a home is prepared for us in heaven. We will show  obedience to one another, as the Holy Scriptures command. We will take  from each other instruction, reproof and punishment, and thus shall we  keep the covenant established by God through the Lord Christ.\"[27] To  this purpose the Brethren held firm. In every detail of their lives--in  business, in pleasure, in civil duties--they took the Sermon on the  Mount as the lamp unto their feet. From the child to the old man, from  the serf to the lord, from the acoluth to the bishop, the same strict  law held good. What made the Brethren's Church shine so brightly in  Bohemia before Luther's days was not their doctrine, but their lives;  not their theory, but their practice; not their opinions, but their  discipline. Without that discipline they would have been a shell without  a kernel. It called forth the admiration of Calvin, and drove Luther to  despair. It was, in truth, the jewel of the Church, her charm against  foes within and without; and so great a part did it play in their lives  that in later years they were known to some as \"Brethren of the Law of  Christ.\"    No portion of the Church was more carefully watched than the ministers.  As the chief object which the Brethren set before them was obedience  to the Law of Christ, it followed, as the night the day, that the  chief quality required in a minister was not theological learning,  but personal character. When a man came forward as a candidate for  the ministry he knew that he would have to stand a most searching  examination. His character and conduct were thoroughly sifted. He must  have a working knowledge of the Bible, a blameless record, and a  living faith in God. For classical learning the Brethren had an honest  contempt. It smacked too much of Rome and monkery. As long as the  candidate was a holy man, and could teach the people the plain truths of  the Christian faith, they felt that nothing more was required, and did  not expect him to know Greek and Hebrew. In vain Luther, in a friendly  letter, urged them to cultivate more knowledge. \"We have no need,\" they  replied, \"of teachers who understand other tongues, such as Greek and  Hebrew. It is not our custom to appoint ministers who have been trained  at advanced schools in languages and fine arts. We prefer Bohemians  and Germans who have come to a knowledge of the truth through personal  experience and practical service, and who are therefore qualified to  impart to others the piety they have first acquired themselves. And here  we are true to the law of God and the practice of the early Church.\"[28] Instead of regarding learning as an aid to faith, they regarded it as  an hindrance and a snare. It led, they declared, to wordy battles, to  quarrels, to splits, to uncertainties, to doubts, to corruptions. As  long, they said, as the ministers of the Church of Christ were simple  and unlettered men, so long was the Church a united body of believers;  but as soon as the parsons began to be scholars, all sorts of evils  arose. What good, they argued, had learning done in the past? It had  caused the translation of the Bible into Latin, and had thus hidden  its truths from the common people. \"And therefore,\" they insisted, \"we  despise the learning of tongues.\"    For this narrow attitude they had also another reason. In order to be  true to the practice of the early Christian Church,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21003"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Ely (#12)"],[1,"lower niches are memorial tablets.    On each side of the lady-chapel are five large windows of four lights  each, with very beautiful tracery. Those on the north side have been  thoroughly restored within the last few years. At the same time the  cusps have been replaced in the large circles, of which two are over the  head of each window. Between the windows are buttresses, necessarily  large, to support the vast extent of the stone-groined roof. At the four  corners are double buttresses, with much larger pinnacles, and two  niches toward the top, the upper one shallow, but the lower deep enough  to hold a statue, and with a projecting canopy. The east end is less  decorated than the west. There was once, as it seems, some sculptured  figure or figures in front of the upper part of the window, no doubt  destroyed when the interior was mutilated.    [Illustration: ELEVATION OF ORIGINAL BAYS OF BISHOP NORTHWOLD'S  PRESBYTERY.]    \"The #East End# of the cathedral itself (Bishop Hugh's work) is a  grand example of Early English.\"[12] Except for the windows of the  chapels of Bishops Alcock and West in the aisles, and that the Early  English lancets in the triforium range in the south aisle have been  removed and a plain wall substituted, this eastern front is almost  unaltered. It does not appear when this last alteration was made. In the  view in Bentham, dated 1767, are represented lancets glazed and blank,  exactly similar to those in the triforium on the north. The windows are  all lancets, without any cusping. Their grouping is specially effective.  In the centre, in the lowest stage, are three broad lancets of equal  height, divided by shafts, and with deep mouldings, and with two sets of  dogtooth all round. Below the string-course above are four deep  quatrefoils. In the next stage the lancets are five in number, the  central one being the tallest, while above the outer ones are trefoiled  niches; and there are two six-foils below the next string-course. The  upper stage has three lancets of equal height, which give light to the  space above the stone-groined roof, with a small trefoiled arch,  unglazed, and half of another on each side. In the gable are three large  sunk panels, two of six cusps, and one of eight. The whole is surmounted  by a large handsome cross, restored at the expense of Lady Mildred Hope.  The large buttresses on each side of the central group of windows have  four niches on each side, the three upper ones having bases to support  statues; the upper and lower of these have trefoiled heads, the two  others cinquefoiled heads. At the summit are sunk trefoils under the  gabled tops; and a little further to the west, on the south, the whole  is finished by an octangular turret with shallow arches and a pyramidal  top with crockets.[13] The buttresses at the corners of the aisles have  much loftier pyramidal heads. These have also crockets. The east end of  the triforium range on the north is particularly good. The east window  of Bishop Alcock's chapel, which was of course in existence long before  his time, is round-headed, with four lights, and some good Decorated  tracery. That to Bishop West's chapel, in the south aisle, is of five  lights, of very late Perpendicular character. It may be noticed that the  window in the north aisle is in the wall as originally built, but in the  south aisle the whole wall has been advanced further east, as far as the  bases of the buttresses.    Both of #The Aisles# have on the sides large pinnacled buttresses of  graceful design; and from all of these on the north, and from some on  the south, there rise flying buttresses to support the roof of the  presbytery and choir. Two of the bays on the south side have the Early  English triforium range unaltered. This gives the original height of  Bishop Hugh's triforium walls. Below the parapet here is a  characteristic corbel table. These bays form the western portion of  Bishop Hugh's work in the presbytery.    [Illustration: THE LANTERN AND SOUTH TRANSEPT.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]    The retention of this little portion of the Early English #Triforium#  is very interesting and instructive; for we should otherwise not have  known precisely how this part of the work had been carried out.  Professor Willis traced out with great care the alterations to which  the presbytery had been subjected, and his conclusions are given in  Canon Stewart's book. Early triforium windows were only for lighting the  triforium passage; they were small, and could not be seen from the floor  of the church. It will be noticed that the windows remaining in the  portion spoken of are quite small and quite close to the floor. The  changes that were made in the three great Norman minsters, Norwich,  Peterborough, and Ely, were \"made evidently for the purpose of  introducing more light into the church.\" The walls were raised, the  windows much enlarged, and the slope of the roof consequently much  flattened. No doubt, as regards dimensions, Bishop Hugh's triforium was  a continuation of the Norman triforium of the choir. The first  appearance of a high triforium outer wall is in Bishop Hotham's work  (1316-1337). \"In the following centuries this new form was extended by  alterations, first to Hugh de Northwold's presbytery and next to the  nave. But before the Early English gallery had been thus completely  transformed, it happened that some architect, apparently employed by  Bishop Barnet [1366-1374], introduced in two of the southern  compartments a method of getting rid of the gloom of the low-windowed,  Early English triforium, which, although perfectly successful within the  church, would, if it had been carried throughout, have been productive  of a most injurious effect upon the appearance of the fabric within and  without, as may be seen at present in the compartments in question.\"[14]  This method was to remove entirely the triforium roof, and to convert  the open arcade of the triforium towards the church into windows by  filling the tracery with glass. The designer thus introduced a flood of  light upon the choir altar, the shrines in the neighbourhood, and Bishop  Barnet's tomb under the pier arch, which is beneath one of these  windows. Fortunately the experiment was not repeated. After some time  had elapsed, the changes above indicated were carried out; the low Early  English triforium outer wall was removed, and the loftier Decorated wall  and windows erected. In the extract above given it looks as if the  removal of the triforium roof, putting a lead roof to the aisle below,  and turning the triforium arches into windows, were confined to these  two bays on the south. But the same thing was also done in the two  corresponding bays on the north. But there, when the later raising of  the triforium walls took place, this raised wall was continued over the  two bays in question; and we do not now see there any remains of Early  English work.    [Illustration: THE PRIOR'S DOORWAY.                _Photochrom Co. Ltd. Photo._]    In the east wall of the #South Transept# are broad, geometrical  windows of two lights each. At the top of the southern face of this  transept, deeply recessed, is an extraordinary Perpendicular window of  seven lights. There seems no record of this being constructed. By the  remains of corbels in the lower part of the wall we see that there was  once a covered passage here, no doubt connecting the cloister with the  chapter-house.    Beyond the transept are three Norman doors of exceptional interest. One,  indeed, is in the west side of the transept, and must have been the  original entrance here into the church. It is now quite blocked up with  stone. It has only recently been discovered. There are remains of two  Norman doors, the lower, with enriched mouldings and shaft, being  considerably later in date than the round arch above it. This latter has  the nail-head ornament. The northern end of the arch is concealed, as  well as the eastern end of the adjoining door into the south aisle, by a  mass of masonry built for a buttress.    The door into the south aisle is known as #The Monks' Door#, and is  the regular entrance into the cathedral from the south. It opened from  the eastern walk of the cloister. It is of later date than the wall in  which it is placed. The ornamentation is very rich; one spiral column is  especially noteworthy. There is a trefoiled arch, the cusps having  circular terminations with the star ornament. In the spandrels are  quaint, crouching monks, each holding a pastoral staff. Above are two  curiously twisted dragons.    #The Prior's Door# is nearly at the west end of the north alley of  the cloister. Like the monks' door, it is an insertion, being later than  the wall. It is a very fine specimen of late Norman. The tympanum is  filled with carving in high relief. In the centre is the Saviour,  seated, enclosed within a _vesica piscis_, His right hand uplifted in  blessing, His left hand resting on an open book; His bare feet rest  upon the border of the oval enclosure. This oval is supported by two  angels, the arms which hold the upper part being abnormally lengthened.  On each side is a round shaft, enriched with a deeply cut series of  ornaments running in a spiral; and at the head is a cushion capital with  interlacing ornamentation. On each side of the shaft is a square pillar,  the outer one having some curious figures of beasts and other objects  enclosed in circular rings, while the foliage of the inner one is  singularly like a premature specimen of Early English conventional  decoration. The topmost stone of this inner jamb is enlarged into a  corbel to support the lintel, and is carved with a large face. The  expense of the restoration of this doorway was undertaken by the  Bedfordshire Architectural Society.[15]    One or two bays of the north alley of #The Cloister# have been lately  restored by Canon Dickson as a vestry for the "]]]
