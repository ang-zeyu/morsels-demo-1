In April, 1532, Pizarro embarked his men on the ships and landed, not  without some fierce fighting, at Tumbez, on the coast of Peru.  At last  the expedition was on solid ground and nothing prevented its further  advance.  On the 18th of May, therefore, they took up the march for the  interior, little dreaming of the ultimate fate that awaited them all.      III. \"A Communistic Despotism.\"    The empire of Peru well deserved the title of Magnificent.  The highest  civilization attained on the Western Hemisphere had been reached on  this South American coast.  A form of government unique in history had  been developed and put in operation by a capable and enlightened  people.  It was a \"communistic despotism,\" a community with a despot  and a ruling class superimposed upon its socialism.  The sway of these  despots was exceedingly mild and gentle, even if absolute.  With  wonderful ingenuity and a rare capacity for organization, upon the {69}  ruins of an older civilization, they built the Inca Empire.    The Incas were the ruling tribe, the Emperor being the Inca par  excellence.  Their empire was as thoroughly organized as it is possible  for a community to be.  Indeed, it was organized to death; the Inca was  the empire, and one source of the empire's speedy downfall was due to  the fact that the national spirit of the Peruvians had been so crushed  by the theocratic despotism of their rulers that they viewed the change  of masters with more or less indifference.  When the Incas conquered a  country and people they so arranged affairs as to incorporate the  people as part of the empire.  They called their domains  grandiloquently \"the four quarters of the earth.\"  They did not govern  this great territory by brute force as did the Aztecs--although they  knew how to use the sword if necessary--but by methods dictated by  prudent and profound policy, productive of peaceful success.  The mild  government of the Incas was at once patriarchal, theocratic and  despotic.  Whatever it was, from the Incas' point of view it was  absolute and satisfactory.    Prescott's account of the Inca civilization reads like a romance, yet  it is practically borne out by all chroniclers who have discussed the  subject, some of whom appear to desire to find the great American  historian at fault.  Large and populous cities existed, communication  between which was had by great national roads traversing every part of  the land.  Vast herds of llamas were domesticated, from the hair of  which the exquisitely woven cloth was made.  Agriculture flourished.  The country, upraised from the sea by the great range of mountains,  afforded every variety of {70} climate from temperate to tropic, and  the diversified products of the soil corresponded with the  opportunities presented.  And every foot of space was utilized for a  population of millions of industrious workers, with an economy and  resourcefulness only emulated by the Chinese in the working of their  country.  Even the mountain-sides were terraced by tiny farms.    The Peruvians had made some progress in the arts, less in science.  They lacked the art of writing, although they possessed a highly  developed system of mnemonic aids in the form of curiously knotted and  particolored strings called quipus.  Their literature, if the  contradiction be permitted, was handed down like their history, by oral  tradition.    Great as had been their achievements, however, they were in a curious  state of arrested development.  With the Peruvians, says Helps,  \"everything stopped short.\"  They had not arrived at a finality  anywhere, save perhaps in their mode of government.  They could erect  enormous time-defying buildings, but they knew of no way to roof them  except by thatching them.  Their roads were marvels of engineering  construction, but they could not build bridges except frail ones made  out of osier cables.  No wheels ran along the smooth, well-paved,  magnificent highways.  They could refine gold and silver and make  weapons of tempered copper, but they were entirely ignorant of the use  of iron.  The greatest human development has depended upon that last  metal.  The great nations are those which have had the steel-tempered  sword blades in their hands.  They could administer a colony in a way  to excite the admiration of the world, and yet not write a line.  There  is little probability that they would have progressed much beyond the  state at which {71} they had arrived, _for there was no individual  liberty in the land_.  That was the fatal defect in their system.  It  was the lack which put that touch of finality to their otherwise  marvelously developed condition and which limited inexorably their  civilization.  The unchangeable conditions were stifling to ambition  and paralyzing to achievement.  The two things the country lacked were  the two vital things to human progress and human success--letters and  liberty.    The religious development of the Peruvians was very high.  They  worshipped an unknown Supreme Being and they worshipped him, it is  conclusively demonstrated, without human sacrifice.  Objectively they  paid their chief adoration to the sun, moon and stars, and to the Inca  as the child or earthly representative of the sun.  Sun-worship is the  noblest and highest of all the purely natural religions.  When to this  was superadded an instinctive feeling for a great First Cause, of which  the solar magnificence was but a manifestation, the religion of the  Peruvians is entitled to great respect.    Their history ran back into the mists of the past.  At the time of the  arrival of Pizarro, a curious condition, anomalous in their records,  had arisen.  Huayna Capac, one of the greatest monarchs of the Inca  line, had extended his dominion by force of arms over the rich province  of Quito, far to the north.  He had taken as one of his concubines the  daughter of the conquered monarch of Quito and by her had a son named  Atahualpa.[4]    The son of the monarch by his sister, his only legal {72} wife, or  Coya--the irrevocable Peruvian method of providing for the Inca  succession--was named Huascar.  Huayna on his deathbed, after a  glorious reign of forty years, made the fatal mistake of dividing his  dominion between Huascar, to whom was given ancient Peru, and  Atahualpa, who took Quito to the north.  World-history, of which Huayna  could have known nothing, has shown conclusively enough that such a  policy has always brought about civil war, and this startling reversal  of Peruvian custom by a doting monarch on his deathbed produced the  usual results.    The armies of Atahualpa, led by two famous soldiers called Quiz-Quiz  and Chalcuchima, had met and defeated the troops of Huascar in a series  of bloody battles.  They had taken that unhappy monarch prisoner and,  by a series of terrible massacres instigated by Atahualpa, had striven  with large success to cut off the family of the unfortunate Inca root  and branches.  The land had been devastated by the fierceness of the  internecine conflict, towns had been carried by storm, the inhabitants  put to the sword; the ordinary course of events had been interrupted  and agriculture had languished; the empire lay gasping under the paw of  the Peruvian usurper when Pizarro landed upon the shore.  The strife  that was to ensue was between two base-born, cruel-hearted soldiers of  fortune, one at the head of a little body of white men, but with all  the prestige of their color and development in warfare, and weapons,  the other, the now undisputed monarch of a vast if prostrate and  exhausted empire, at the head of great armies flushed with victory and  eager for new conquests.    What would the result of the struggle be?    {73}    IV. The Treacherous and Bloody Massacre of Caxamarca.    Having marched some thirty miles south of Tumbezin the pleasant spring  weather, Pizarro, finding what he conceived to be a favorable location  for a permanent colony, encamped his army, laid out and began to build  a city, which he called San Miguel.  The Spaniards were great builders  and the city was planned and fortified on an extensive scale and the  more important buildings erected, so that it was not until September  that Pizarro considered his base of supplies had been made secure.    Meanwhile he had been assiduously seeking information on every hand  concerning the internal dissensions in the Peruvian empire, so that he  could undertake his conquest intelligently.  On the 24th of September,  1532, the valiant little army was mustered and, after deducting a small  garrison for San Miguel, those appointed for the expedition were found  to include sixty-seven horsemen, three arquebusiers, twenty crossbowmen  and eighty-seven footmen, in all one hundred and seventy-seven.[5]    They were accompanied by two pieces of small artillery called  falconets, each having a bore of two inches and carrying a shot  weighing about a pound and a half, being, with the three arquebusiers,  General De Candia's command.  With this insignificant force, augmented,  I suppose, by some Indian captives acting as pack-mules, Pizarro  started out to conquer an empire conservatively estimated to contain  from ten to twelve millions of people, supporting an army of  disciplined {74} soldiers whose numbers ran into the hundreds of  thousands.    The Spanish forces were well equipped and in good condition, but as  they left the sea-shore and advanced, without molestation, to be sure,  through the populous country, some idea of the magnitude of their  self-appointed task permeated the minds of the common soldiery, and  evidences of hesitation, reluctance and dissension speedily appeared.  The unwillingness of the men grew until Pizarro was forced to take  notice of it.  Halting on the fifth day in a pleasant valley, he met  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20912"],[0,"The Daffodil Mystery (#12)"],[1,"quietly.    \"I won't press it for a moment,\" said Tarling, \"because I realise that it  is bound up in certain other extraordinary actions of yours, Miss Rider.\"    The girl flushed and dropped her eyes, and Tarling went on:    \"Why did you leave London secretly, without giving your friends or your  mother any inkling of your plans?\"    She looked up sharply.    \"Have you seen mother?\" she asked quietly, and again her eyes were  troubled.    \"I've seen your mother,\" said Tarling. \"I have also seen the telegram you  sent to her. Come, Miss Rider, won't you let me help you? Believe me, a  great deal more depends upon your answers than the satisfaction of my  curiosity. You must realise how very serious your position is.\"    He saw her lips close tightly and she shook her head.    \"I have nothing to say,\" she said with a catch of her breath. \"If--if you  think I have----\"    She stopped dead.    \"Finish your sentence,\" said Tarling sternly. \"If I think you have  committed this crime?\"    She nodded.    He put away his notebook before he spoke again, and, leaning over the  bed, took her hand.    \"Miss Rider, I want to help you,\" he said earnestly, \"and I can help you  best if you're frank with me. I tell you I do not believe that you  committed this act. I tell you now that though all the circumstances  point to your guilt, I have absolute confidence that you can produce an  answer to the charge.\"    For a moment her eyes filled with tears, but she bit her lip and smiled  bravely into his face.    \"That is good and sweet of you, Mr. Tarling, and I do appreciate your  kindness. But I can't tell you anything--I can't, I can't!\" She gripped  his wrist in her vehemence, and he thought she was going to break down,  but again, with an extraordinary effort of will which excited his secret  admiration, she controlled herself.    \"You're going to think very badly of me,\" she said, \"and I hate the  thought, Mr. Tarling--you don't know how I hate it. I want you to think  that I am innocent, but I am going to make no effort to prove that I was  not guilty.\"    \"You're mad!\" he interrupted her roughly \"Stark, raving mad! You must do  something, do you hear? You've got to do something.\"    She shook her head, and the little hand which rested on his closed gently  about two of his fingers.    \"I can't,\" she said simply. \"I just can't.\"    Tarling pushed back the chair from the bed. He could have groaned at the  hopelessness of the girl's case. If she had only given him one thread  that would lead him to another clue, if she only protested her innocence!  His heart sank within him, and he could only shake his head helplessly.    \"Suppose,\" he said huskily, \"that you are charged with this--crime. Do  you mean to tell me that you will not produce evidence that could prove  your innocence, that you will make no attempt to defend yourself?\"    She nodded.    \"I mean that,\" she said.    \"My God! You don't know what you're saying,\" he cried, starting up.  \"You're mad, Odette, stark mad!\"    She only smiled for the fraction of a second, and that at the unconscious  employment of her Christian name.    \"I'm not at all mad,\" she said. \"I am very sane.\"    She looked at him thoughtfully, and then of a sudden seemed to shrink  back, and her face went whiter. \"You--you have a warrant for me!\" she  whispered.    He nodded.    \"And you're going to arrest me?\"    He shook his head.    \"No,\" he said briefly. \"I am leaving that to somebody else. I have  sickened of the case, and I'm going out of it.\"    \"He sent you here,\" she said slowly.    \"He?\"    \"Yes--I remember. You were working with him, or he wanted you to work  with him.\"    \"Of whom are you speaking?\" asked Tarling quickly.    \"Thornton Lyne,\" said the girl.    Tarling leaped to his feet and stared down at her.    \"Thornton Lyne?\" he repeated. \"Don't you know?\"    \"Know what?\" asked the girl with a frown.    \"That Thornton Lyne is dead,\" said Tarling, \"and that it is for his  murder that a warrant has been issued for your arrest?\"    She looked at him for a moment with wide, staring eyes.    \"Dead!\" she gasped. \"Dead! Thornton Lyne dead! You don't mean that, you  don't mean that?\" She clutched at Tarling's arm. \"Tell me that isn't  true! He did not do it, he dare not do it!\"    She swayed forward, and Tarling, dropping on his knees beside the bed,  caught her in his arms as she fainted.          CHAPTER XII    THE HOSPITAL BOOK      While the nurse was attending to the girl Tarling sought an interview  with the medical officer in charge of the hospital.    \"I don't think there's a great deal the matter with her,\" said the  doctor. \"In fact, she was fit for discharge from hospital two or three  days ago, and it was only at her request that we let her stay. Do I  understand that she is wanted in connection with the Daffodil Murder?\"    \"As a witness,\" said Tarling glibly. He realised that he was saying a  ridiculous thing, because the fact that a warrant was out for Odette  Rider must have been generally known to the local authorities. Her  description had been carefully circulated, and that description must have  come to the heads of hospitals and public institutions. The next words  of the doctor confirmed his knowledge.    \"As a witness, eh?\" he said dryly. \"Well, I don't want to pry into your  secrets, or rather into the secrets of Scotland Yard, but she is fit to  travel just as soon as you like.\"    There was a knock on the door, and the matron came into the doctor's  office.    \"Miss Rider wishes to see you, sir,\" she said, addressing Tarling, and  the detective, taking up his hat, went back to the little ward.    He found the girl more composed but still deathly white. She was out of  bed, sitting in a big arm chair, wrapped in a dressing-gown, and she  motioned Tarling to pull up a chair to her side. She waited until after  the door had closed behind the nurse, then she spoke.    \"It was very silly of me to faint, Mr. Tarling but the news was so  horrible and so unexpected. Won't you tell me all about it? You see, I  have not read a newspaper since I have been in the hospital. I heard one  of the nurses talk about the Daffodil Murder--that is not the----\"    She hesitated, and Tarling nodded. He was lighter of heart now, almost  cheerful. He had no doubt in his mind that the girl was innocent, and  life had taken on a rosier aspect.    \"Thornton Lyne,\" he began, \"was murdered on the night of the 14th. He was  last seen alive by his valet about half-past nine in the evening. Early  next morning his body was found in Hyde Park. He had been shot dead, and  an effort had been made to stanch the wound in his breast by binding a  woman's silk night-dress round and round his body. On his breast somebody  had laid a bunch of daffodils.\"    \"Daffodils?\" repeated the girl wonderingly. \"But how----\"    \"His car was discovered a hundred yards from the place,\" Tarling  continued, \"and it was clear that he had been murdered elsewhere, brought  to the Park in his car, and left on the sidewalk. At the time he was  discovered he had on neither coat nor vest, and on his feet were a pair  of list slippers.\"    \"But I don't understand,\" said the bewildered girl. \"What does it mean?  Who had----\" She stopped suddenly, and the detective saw her lips tighten  together, as though to restrain her speech. Then suddenly she covered her  face with her hands.    \"Oh, it's terrible, terrible!\" she whispered. \"I never thought, I never  dreamed--oh, it is terrible!\"    Tarling laid his hand gently on her shoulder.    \"Miss Rider,\" he said, \"you suspect somebody of this crime. Won't you  tell me?\"    She shook her head without looking up.    \"I can say nothing,\" she said.    \"But don't you see that suspicion will attach to you?\" urged Tarling.  \"A telegram was discovered amongst his belongings, asking him to call  at your flat that evening.\"    She looked up quickly.    \"A telegram from me?\" she said. \"I sent no telegram.\"    \"Thank God for that!\" cried Tarling fervently. \"Thank God for that!\"    \"But I don't understand, Mr. Tarling. A telegram was sent to Mr. Lyne  asking him to come to my flat? Did he go to my flat?\"    Tarling nodded.    \"I have reason to believe he did,\" he said gravely. \"The murder was  committed in your flat.\"    \"My God!\" she whispered. \"You don't mean that! Oh, no, no, it is  impossible!\"    Briefly he recited all his discoveries. He knew that he was acting in a  manner which, from the point of view of police ethics, was wholly wrong  and disloyal. He was placing her in possession of all the clues and  giving her an opportunity to meet and refute the evidence which had been  collected against her. He told her of the bloodstains on the floor, and  described the night-dress which had been found around Thornton Lyne's  body.    \"That was my night-dress,\" she said simply and without hesitation. \"Go  on, please, Mr. Tarling.\"    He told her of the bloody thumb-prints upon the door of the bureau.    \"On your bed,\" he went on, \"I found your dressing-case, half-packed.\"    She swayed forward, and threw out her hands, groping blindly.    \"Oh, how wicked, how wicked!\" she wailed \"He did it, he did it!\"    \"Who?\" demanded Tarling.    He took the girl by the shoulder and shook her.    \"Who was the man? You must tell me. Your own life depends upon it. Don't  you see, Odette, I want to help you? I want to clear your name of this  terrible charge. You suspect somebody. I must have his name.\"    She shook her head and turned her pathetic face to his.    \"I can't tell you,\" she said in a low voice. \"I can say no more. I  knew nothing of the murder until you told me. I had no idea, no  thought.... I hated Thornton Lyne, I hated him, but I would not have  hurt him ... it is dreadful, dreadful!\"    Presently she grew calmer.    \"I must go to London at once,\" she said. \"Will you please take me back?\"    She saw his embarrassment and was quick to understand its cause.    \"You--you have a warrant, haven'"]]]
