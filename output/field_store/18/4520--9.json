The act of _addition_ does therefore enter into the processes of  music-writing, as well as _extension_.  Phrase may be added to phrase,  in order to increase the primary material, and to provide for greater  breadth of basis, and a richer fund of resources.  The condition to be  respected is, that such aggregation shall not become the ruling trait,  and, by its excess, supplant the main purpose,--that of _development_.  That is, it must be held rigidly within the domain of Unity.  The  student of the classic page will therefore expect to find a more or  less marked family resemblance, so to speak; prevailing throughout the  various phrases that may be associated upon that page.    Each additional phrase should be, and as a rule will be, sufficiently  \"new\" in some respect or other to impart renewed energy to the  movement; but--so long as it is to impress the hearer as being the same  movement--there will still remain such points of contact with the  foregoing phrase or phrases as to demonstrate its derivation from them,  its having \"grown out\" of them.    This process of addition (not to be confounded with the methods of  extending a single phrase, illustrated in the preceding chapter) is  exhibited first, and most naturally, in the so-called Period-form.      THE PERIOD.--The Period-form is obtained by the addition of a second  phrase to the first.  It is therefore, in a sense, a double phrase;  that is, it consists of two connected phrases, covering _eight ordinary  measures_, or just double the number commonly assigned to the single  phrase.    Each one of these phrases must, of course, have its individual cadence,  or point of repose; the first--called the _Antecedent phrase_--has its  cadence in the fourth measure, and the second--called the _Consequent  phrase_--in the eighth measure.  The effect of the Period-form is that  of a longer sentence interrupted exactly in the middle,--not unlike a  bridge of two spans, resting on a central pier.  But, precisely as the  central pier is only an intermediate point of support, and not terra  firma, so the ending of the Antecedent phrase is never anything more  weighty than a semicadence, while the definite, conclusive, perfect  cadence appears at the end of the Consequent phrase,--or of the entire  period-form.    The reason for this distinction of cadence is obvious.  A period is not  two separate phrases, but two related and coherent phrases which  mutually balance each other.  The Consequent phrase is not merely an  \"addition\" to the first, but is its complement and \"fulfilment.\"  The  two phrases represent the musical analogy of what, in rhetoric, would  be called thesis and antithesis, or, simply, question and answer.  In a  well-constructed period the Antecedent phrase is, therefore, always  more or less _interrogative_, and the Consequent phrase _responsive_,  in character.    For illustration (Mendelssohn, No. 28):--    [Illustration: Example 44.  Fragment of Mendelssohn.]      The co-operation, or interaction, of the principles of Unity and  Variety, is nowhere more strikingly shown than in the formulation of  the musical period.  Either element has the right to predominate, to a  reasonable degree, though never to the exclusion or injury of the  other.  In the above example, the principle of Unity predominates to a  somewhat unusual extent:--not only the figures (marked 1-2-3-4), and  the motives (_a-b_), are uniform, in the Antecedent phrase itself, but  the melody of the Consequent phrase corresponds very closely throughout  to that of the Antecedent, only excepting a trifling change in the  course (marked _N. B._), and the last few tones, which are necessarily  so altered as to transform the semicadence into a perfect cadence.  It  is this significant change, _at the cadence_, which prevents the second  phrase from being merely a \"repetition\" of the first one,--which makes  it a \"Consequent,\" a response to the one that precedes.    Further (Mendelssohn, No. 23):--    [Illustration: Example 45.  Fragment of Mendelssohn.]      In this example also, the Consequent phrase is a complete affirmation  of its Antecedent, agreeing in its melodic form with the latter until  the cadence is nearly due, when an extra measure is inserted (as  extension), and the usual digression into the necessary perfect cadence  is made.  The condition of Unity predominates, but a noticeable  infusion of Variety takes place.    Further (Mozart, pianoforte sonata):--    [Illustration: Example 46.  Fragment of Mozart.]      Here, again, the condition of Unity prevails, but with a still greater  infusion of Variety; the melody of the Consequent phrase _resembles_  that of the Antecedent in every detail; the rhythm is identical, and it  is evident that the second phrase is designed to balance the first,  figure for figure, the principal change being that some of the figures  are simply turned upside down (compare the places marked _N. B._).  The  semicadence rests upon a dominant chord (fifth-step) of D major; the  perfect cadence upon the same chord, it is true, but as _tonic_ harmony  of A major, with keynote in the extreme parts.  Being a keynote, though  not in the original key, it is valid as perfect cadence.    Further (Beethoven, pianoforte sonata, op. 13):--    [Illustration: Example 47.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    [Illustration: Example 47 continued.]      In this example, the condition of Variety predominates decidedly.  The  Consequent melody differs totally from the Antecedent, even in rhythm,  and the necessary portion of Unity is exhibited only in equality of  length, _uniformity of accompaniment_, and similarity of character  (tonality, and general harmonic and rhythmic effect).  Observe the  diversity of melodic extent, in the two phrases, in consequence of the  preliminary tone borrowed from the semicadence for the Consequent  phrase.  Greater variety than here will rarely be found between two  successive phrases that are intended to form the halves of one coherent  period.    For more minute technical details see the HOMOPHONIC FORMS, Chapter V.      LESSON 7.  Analyze the following examples.  Locate the cadences;  compare the phrases and define the degrees of Unity and of Variety  exhibited in the melody, or elsewhere; and mark such irregularities of  forms (or extensions) as may be found:--    Mendelssohn, Songs Without Words, No. 35, measures 5 1/2-13.  (By 5 1/2  is meant the _middle_ of the fifth measure, instead of its beginning.)    No. 45, first 8 measures.    No. 29, measures 4 1/2-12.    No. 14,   \"   1-8.    No. 34,   \"   1-10.    No. 18,   \"   1-9; 10-17.    No. 9,    \"   3 1/2-7.    No. 27,   \"   5-12.    Schumann, op. 68, No. 3, measures 1-8; 9-16.    No. 5, measures 1-8; 9-16.  (Do not overlook the preliminary tones  which precede the first measure.)    The first eight measures of Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22, 23, 24,  26, 30, 32, 39.  Also Nos. 13 and 28, first _ten_ measures.    Beethoven, pianoforte sonatas: op. 2, No. 1, _Adagio_, measures 1-8.  Same sonata, third movement, \"Trio,\" measures 1-10.    Op. 2, No. 2, _Largo_, measures 1-8; also _Scherzo_, measures 1-8; also  _Rondo_, measures 1-8.    Op. 2, No. 3, measures 1-13; also _Scherzo_, measures 1-16; also last  movement, measures 1-8.    Op. 10, No. 1, _Finale_, measures 1-8; and measures 16 1/2-28.    Op. 10, No. 3, measures 1-10; also _Largo_, measures 1-9; 9 1/2-17;  also _Menuetto_, measures 1-16; also _Rondo_, measures 1-9.    Op. 14, No. 2, measures 1-8; also _Andante_, measures 1-8; also  _Scherzo_, measures 1-8.    After analyzing these examples, the student may venture to define the  periods in other compositions, classic or popular, especially such as  he may chance to be learning.          CHAPTER VIII.--ENLARGEMENT OF THE PERIOD-FORM.    The processes of extension and development are applied to the period in  the same general manner as to the phrase.  The results, however, are  broader; partly because every operation is performed on a  correspondingly larger scale, and partly because the resources of  technical manipulation increase, naturally, with the growth of the  thematic material.    Among the various methods adopted, there are three, each significant in  its own peculiar way, that provide sufficiently exhaustive directions  for the student of structural analysis.      ENLARGEMENT BY REPETITION.--The first and simplest method is to  increase the length of the period-form by the process of _repetition_;  repetition of the entire sentence, or of any one--or several--of its  component members, in a manner very similar to that already seen in  connection with the single phrase (Chap. VI, Ex. 39, etc.), and under  the same conditions of Unity and Variety; that is, the repetitions may  be nearly or quite literal, or they may have been subjected to such  alterations and variations as the skill and fancy of the composer  suggested.    An example of complete repetition (that is, the repetition of the  entire period), with simple but effective changes, may be found in  Beethoven, pianoforte sonata, op. 13, _Adagio_, measures 1 to 16.  Examine it carefully, and observe, among other details, the treatment  of the perfect cadence (in the 8th measure).  See also, Song Without  Words, No. 27, measures 5 to 20.    The repetition of one of the two phrases is exhibited in the following  (Mozart, sonata No. 14):--    [Illustration: Example 48.  Fragment of Mozart.]      The Antecedent is a regular four-measure phrase, with semicadence (made  on the tonic chord, but with _3d_ as uppermost tone); the Consequent is  a six-measure phrase, with perfect cadence, and is repeated, with  partial change of register.  The whole is a \"period with repeated  Consequent.\"    A somewhat elaborate example of extension by detail-repetition is seen  in the following (Chopin,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19368"],[0,"The Mide'wiwin or \"Grand Medicine Society\" of the Ojibwa (#12)"],[1,"everything about him is covered. The Mid[-e]/ Man/id[-o]s came to him    in his Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n (No. 4), eleven of which appear upon the    inside of that structure, while the ten--all but himself--upon the    outside (Nos. 5 to 14) are represented as descending to the earth,    charged with the means of conferring upon the Ani/shin[^a]b[-e]/g the    sacred rite. In the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n (No. 4) is shown also the sacred    post (No. 15) upon which is perched K[)o]-ko/k[)o]-[-o]--the Owl (No.    16). The line traversing the structure, from side to side, represents    the trail leading through it, while the two rings (Nos. 17 and 18)    upon the right side of the post indicate respectively the spot where    the presents are deposited and the sacred stone--this according to    modern practices.      When an Indian is prepared to receive the rights of initiation he    prepares a wig/iwam (No. 19) in which he takes a steam bath once each    day for four successive days. The four baths and four days are    indicated by the number of spots at the floor of the lodge,    representing stones. The instructors, employed by him, and the    officiating priests of the society are present, one of which (No. 20)    may be observed upon the left of the wig/iwam in the act of making an    offering of smoke, while the one to the right (No. 21) is drumming and    singing. The four officiating priests are visible to either side of    the candidate within the structure. The wig/iwams (Nos. 22, 23, 24,    and 25) designate the village habitations.      In the evening of the day preceding the initiation, the candidate (No.    26) visits his instructor (No. 27) to receive from him final    directions as to the part to be enacted upon the following day. The    candidate is shown in the act of carrying with him his pipe, the    offering of tobacco being the most acceptable of all gifts. His    relatives follow and carry the goods and other presents, some of which    are suspended from the branches of the Mid[-e]/ tree (No. 28) near the    entrance of the first degree structure. The instructor's wig/iwam is    shown at No. 29, the two dark circular spots upon the floor showing    two of the seats, occupied by instructor and pupil. The figure No. 27    has his left arm elevated, denoting that his conversation pertains to    Ki/tshi Man/id[-o], while in his right hand he holds his Mid[-e]/    drum. Upon the following morning the Mid[-e]/ priests, with the    candidate in advance (No. 30), approach and enter the Mid[-e]/wig[^a]n    and the initiation begins. No. 31 is the place of the sacred drum and    those who are detailed to employ the drum and rattles, while No. 32    indicates the officiating priests; No. 33 is the degree post,    surmounted by K[)o]-ko/-k[)o]-[-o]/, the Owl (No. 34). The post is    painted with vermilion, with small white spots all over its surface,    emblematic of the m[-i]/gis shell. The line (No. 35) extending along    the upper portion of the inclosure represents the pole from which are    suspended the robes, blankets, kettles, etc., which constitute the fee    paid to the society for admission.      This degree is presided over and guarded by the Panther Man/id[-o].      When the candidate has been able to procure enough gifts to present to    the society for the second degree, he takes his drum and offers chants    (No. 35) to Ki/tshi Man/id[-o] for success. Ki/tshi Man/id[-o] himself    is the guardian of the second degree and his footprints are shown in    No. 36. No. 37 represents the second degree inclosure, and contains    two sacred posts (Nos. 38 and 39), the first of which is the same as    that of the first degree, the second being painted with white clay,    bearing two bands of vermilion, one about the top and one near the    middle. A small branch near the top is used, after the ceremony is    over, to hang the tobacco pouch on. No. 40 represents the musicians    and attendants; No. 41 the candidate upon his knees; while Nos. 42,    43, 44, and 45 pictures the officiating priests who surround him. The    horizontal pole (No. 46) has presents of robes, blankets, and kettles    suspended from it.      When a candidate is prepared to advance to the third degree (No. 47)    he personates Makwa/ Man/id[-o], who is the guardian of this degree,    and whose tracks (No. 48) are visible. The assistants are visible upon    the interior, drumming and dancing. There are three sacred posts, the    first (No. 49) is black, and upon this is placed    K[)o]-ko/-k[)o]-[-o]/--the Owl; the second (No. 50) is painted with    white clay and has upon the top the effigy of an owl; while the third    (No. 51) is painted with vermilion, bearing upon the summit the effigy    of an Indian. Small wooden effigies of the human figure are used by    the Mid[-e]/ in their tests of the proof of the genuineness and    sacredness of their religion, which tests will be alluded to under    another caption. The horizontal rod (No. 52), extending from one end    of the structure to the other, has suspended from it the blankets and    other gifts.      The guardian of the fourth degree is Maka/no--the Turtle--as he    appears (No. 53) facing the entrance of the fourth degree (No. 54).    Four sacred posts are planted in the fourth degree; the first (No.    55), being painted white upon the upper half and green upon the lower;    the second (No. 56) similar; the third (No. 57) painted red, with a    black spiral line extending from the top to the bottom, and upon which    is placed K[)o]-ko/-k[)o]-[-o]/--the Owl; and the fourth (No. 58),    a cross, the arms and part of the trunk of which is white, with red    spots--to designate the sacred m[-i]/gis--the lower half of the trunk    cut square, the face toward the east painted red, the south green, the    west white, and the north black. The spot (No. 59) at the base of the    cross signifies the place of the sacred stone, while the human figures    (No. 60) designate the participants, some of whom are seated near the    wall of the inclosure, whilst others are represented as beating the    drum. Upon the horizontal pole (No. 61) are shown the blankets    constituting gifts to the society.      [Illustration: Plate VIII.    Ojibwa's Record.]    The several specific methods of facial decoration employed (Pl. VII),  according to Ojibwa's statement, are as follows:    _First degree._--One stripe of vermilion across the face, from near the  ears across the tip of the nose.    _Second degree._--One stripe as above, and another across the eyelids,  temples, and the root of the nose.    _Third degree._--The upper half of the face is painted green and the  lower half red.    _Fourth degree._--The forehead and left side of the face, from the outer  canthus of the eye downward, is painted green; four spots of vermilion  are made with the tip of the finger upon the forehead and four upon the  green surface of the left cheek. In addition to this, the plumes of the  golden eagle, painted red, are worn upon the head and down the back.  This form of decoration is not absolutely necessary, as the expense of  the \"war bonnet\" places it beyond the reach of the greater number of  persons.    Before proceeding further with the explanation of the Mide/ records it  may be of interest to quote the traditions relative to the migration of  the Ani/shin[^a]/b[-e]g, as obtained by Mr. Warren previous to 1853. In  his reference to observing the rites of initiation he heard one of the  officiating priests deliver \"a loud and spirited harangue,\" of which the  following words[12] caught his attention:      \"Our forefathers were living on the great salt water toward the rising    sun, the great Megis (seashell) showed itself above the surface of the    great water and the rays of the sun for a long time period were    reflected from its glossy back. It gave warmth and light to the    An-ish-in-aub-ag (red race). All at once it sank into the deep, and    for a time our ancestors were not blessed with its light. It rose to    the surface and appeared again on the great river which drains the    waters of the Great Lakes, and again for a long time it gave life to    our forefathers and reflected back the rays of the sun. Again it    disappeared from sight and it rose not till it appeared to the eyes of    the An-ish-in-aub-ag on the shores of the first great lake. Again it    sank from sight, and death daily visited the wigiwams of our    forefathers till it showed its back and reflected the rays of the sun    once more at Bow-e-ting (Sault Ste. Marie). Here it remained for a    long time, but once more, and for the last time, it disappeared, and    the An-ish-in-aub-ag was left in darkness and misery, till it floated    and once more showed its bright back at Mo-ning-wun-a-kaun-ing (La    Pointe Island), where it has ever since reflected back the rays of the    sun and blessed our ancestors with life, light, and wisdom. Its rays    reach the remotest village of the widespread Ojibways.\" As the old man    delivered this talk he continued to display the shell, which he    represented as an emblem of the great megis of which he was speaking.      A few days after, anxious to learn the true meaning of this allegory,    *  *  *  I requested him to explain to me the meaning of his Me-da-we    harangue.      After filling his pipe and smoking of the tobacco I had presented he    proceeded to give me the desired information, as follows:      \"My grandson,\" said he, \"the megis I spoke of means the Me-da-we    religion. Our forefathers, many string of lives ago, lived on the    shores of the great salt water in the east. Here, while they were    suffering the ravages of sickness and death, the Great Spirit, at the    intercession of Man-a-bo-sho, the great common uncle of the    An-ish-in-aub-ag, granted them this rite, wherewith life is restored    and prolonged. Our forefathers moved from the shores of the great    water"]]]
