The sailors,  however, had by this time become so accustomed to victory as to  despise the Dons altogether, and insisted upon going forward.    It was with bitter lamentation and regret that they returned,  bringing the body of the admiral's brother. They were now at the  end of the year, and in this week no less than six of the company  died, among whom was Joseph Drake, another of the admiral's  brothers. These losses saddened the crew greatly, and even the  treasures which they had amassed now seemed to them small, and of  little account. Even those who did not take the fever were much  cast down, and Captain Drake determined, without any further loss,  to attempt the expedition on which he had set his mind.    On February 3rd, being Shrove Tuesday, he started with eighteen  English and thirteen Simeroons for Panama. He had now, since he  sailed, lost no less than twenty-eight of the party which set out  from Plymouth.    In a few days they reached Venta Cruz, but one of the men, who had  taken too much strong liquor, made a noise; and the alarm being  given, much of the treasure was carried out of the place, before  they could effect a landing. They followed, however, one of the  treasure parties out of the town, and pursued them for some  distance. On their way they came across another large convoy, with  gold. This they easily took and, having sent the Spaniards away,  unloaded the mules and buried the gold, desiring to press on  further.    As they went, one of the chief Simeroons took the admiral apart  from the road they were traversing, and led him to the foot of a  lofty tree. Upon this steps had been cut, and the Indian told the  admiral to ascend, and see what he could observe from the top. Upon  reaching the summit, the admiral gave a shout of joy and  astonishment. From that point he could see the Pacific Ocean, and  by turning his head the Atlantic, which they had just left.    This was a joyful moment for the great sailor, and when he  descended, one by one most of the men climbed to the top of the  tree, to see the two oceans.    Drake was the first Englishman who had seen this sight. To the  Spaniards it was, of course, familiar; indeed, Vasco Nunez had  stood upon the spot and had seen the Pacific, and taken possession  of it, in the name of Spain, in the year 1513.    They now retraced their steps; for, with the force at their  disposal, Captain Drake thought it would be madness to cross the  isthmus, with any view of attacking the Spaniards on the other  side. He had now accomplished his purpose, and had learned the  nature and geography of the place; and proposed, on some future  occasion, to return with a force sufficient to carry out the great  enterprises on which he had set his mind.    On their return, they were sorely disappointed at finding that the  Spaniards, having captured one of the party, had extorted from him  the hiding place of the gold, and had lifted and carried it off.  They now prepared to re-embark in their pinnace. Reaching the  seashore, however, they were surprised, and in some way dismayed,  at seeing seven Spanish vessels nearing the coast. The Spaniards  had at last determined to make an effort, and had arrived at a time  more unfortunate for the English than could have been supposed. The  pinnace, after landing the party, had sailed away, in order to  prevent the Spaniards seizing upon those on board; and when Captain  Drake reached the shore she was not in sight, having indeed hauled  her wind, and made off, on the approach of the Spanish fleet.    The situation seemed bad, indeed, for it was certain that the  Spaniards would land their troops and search the shore; and it was  of the highest importance that the pinnace should be discovered  first.    There was a counsel held, and the men were well-nigh despairing.  Captain Drake, however, bade them keep up their courage, and  pointed out to them the four lads, all of whom had escaped the  effect of fever and disease, their constitution, no doubt, being  strengthened by the fact that none of them indulged in too much  liquor; indeed, seldom touching any.    \"Look,\" said Captain Drake, \"at these four lads. Their courage is  unshaken, and they look cheerful and hopeful on all occasions. Take  example from them, and keep up your hopes. I propose to make a raft  upon which I myself will embark, and by making out from this bay  into the open sea, may succeed in catching sight of the pinnace,  and bringing it hither to your rescue.\"    The proposal seemed a desperate one, for it was far more likely  that the Spaniards' ships would come along, and descry the raft,  than that the latter should meet with the pinnace. However, there  seemed no other resource. The materials for the raft were scanty  and weak; and when Captain Francis, with three companions, got  fairly out of the bay, the raft sank so deeply in the water that  they were completely standing in the sea.    For some hours they beat about; and then, to their great joy, they  descried the pinnace in the distance, making for land. The wind had  now risen, and it was blowing hard, and their position on the raft  was dangerous enough. They found that it would be impossible for  them to keep at sea, and still more impossible to place themselves  in the track of the pinnaces, which were making for a bay behind a  projecting headland.    Painfully paddling the raft to the shore, Captain Francis landed;  and they made their way, with much toil and fatigue, over the hill  which divided them from that bay; and, towards morning, got down to  the pinnace, where they were received with much joy. Then they at  once launched the boat, and made for the spot where they had left  their comrades. These received them as if risen from the dead, for  they had all made up their minds that their admiral, and his  companions, had been lost upon the frail raft on which they had  embarked.    They now put to sea, and had the good fortune to escape the ken of  the Spaniards, who had sailed further up the coast. So, thanking  God for their escape, they sailed back to the bay where the Pacha  and her prizes lay, and then all hands began to make great  preparation for return home.          Chapter 5: Cast Ashore.        It was time, indeed, for the little band of adventurers to be  turning their faces towards England. Their original strength, of  eighty men, was reduced to fifty; and of these, many were sick and  weak. They had gained a vast store of wealth, although they had  missed the plunder of Nombre de Dios and of Carthagena. Their  doings had caused such consternation and alarm that it was certain  that the Spaniards would, ere long, make a great and united effort  to crush them; and fifty men, however valiant, could not battle  with a fleet. The men were longing for home, looking forward to the  delight of spending the great share of prize money which would fall  to each. The sudden death which had stricken many of their comrades  had, too, cast a chill on the expedition, and made all long more  eagerly to be away from those beautiful, but deadly, shores.    When, therefore, on the day after the return of Captain Francis,  the word was given to prepare for the homeward voyage, the most  lively joy prevailed. The stores were embarked; the Simeroons, who  had done them good service, dismissed with rich presents; and all  embarked, with much joy and thankfulness that their labors and  dangers were overpast.    They were, however, extremely shorthanded, and were scattered among  the three or four prizes which were the best among the ships which  they had taken. Ned and Gerald, being now able to give good  assistance, in case of need, to the sailors, were put on board one  of the prizes with four seamen. Captain Drake had determined to  keep, for a time, the prizes with him; for as it might well be that  they should meet, upon their way, a great Spanish fleet, he thought  that by keeping together, with the flag of Saint George flying on  all the ships, the Spaniards would believe that the Pacha had been  joined by ships from England, and so would assuredly let her and  her consorts pass at large. At the last land at which they touched  Captain Drake intended to dismiss all but one of the prizes, and to  sail across the Atlantic with her and the Pacha.    This, however, was not to be.    One day, shortly after their departure, Ned said to Gerald:    \"I do not like the look of the sky. It reminds me of the sky that  we had before that terrible hurricane, when we were moored off the  Isle of Pines; and with our scanty crew we should be in a mightily  unfavorable position, should the wind come on to blow.\"    In that wise the sailors shared Ned's apprehensions, and in the  speediest possible time all sail was lowered, and the ship prepared  to meet the gale. It was not long before the whole sky was covered  with black clouds. Captain Drake signaled to the vessels that each  was to do its best; and, if separated, was to rendezvous at the  spot before agreed upon. Then, all having been done that could be  thought of, they waited the bursting of the storm.    It came at last, with the suddenness and almost the force of an  explosion. A faint rumbling noise was first heard, a white line of  foam was seen in the distance; and then, with a roar and a crash,  the hurricane was upon them. The vessel reeled over so far under  the blow that, for a time, all on board thought that she would  capsize. The two sailors at the helm, however, held on sturdily;  and at last her head drifted off on the wind, and she flew along  before its force.    The sea rose as if by magic. Where, for weeks, scarcely a ripple  had ruffled the surface of the water; now great waves, with crested  tops, tore along. The air was full of blinding foam, swept from the  tops of the waves; and it was difficult for those on board even to  breathe, when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19207"],[0,"The Firelight Fairy Book (#12)"],[1,"died,  and he continued his way on foot.    Three long years passed, and Bobo grew into a handsome lad, but remained  a simpleton still. Finally, after he had wandered all about Fairyland,  he came to the edge of the sea. Finding a ship moored in a little  harbor, Bobo asked the sailors if they had seen a lost half-hour.    \"No,\" said the sailors, \"but we are going to the Isles of Iron;  suppose you go with us. The lost half-hour may be there.\"    So Bobo went aboard the ship, and sailed out upon the dark sea.    For two days the weather was warm and clear, but on the third day, there  came a dreadful storm, and on the third night the vessel was driven far  off her course into the unknown ocean, and was wrecked upon a mysterious  island of rocks that shone in the night like wet matches. A great wave  swept the decks, and Bobo was borne away from his companions and carried  toward the shining land. Though pounded and battered by the foaming  waves, the simpleton at length managed to reach the beach, and took  refuge in a crevice of the cliff during the stormy night.    When the dawn broke, all sign of the ship had disappeared. Looking  about, Bobo found himself on a lovely island whose heart was a high  mountain mass hidden in the fog still sweeping in from the sea. There  was not a house, a road, or a path to be seen. Suddenly Bobo noticed a  strange little door in the bark of a great lonely tree, and, opening  this door, he discovered a little cupboard in which were a pair of  wooden shoes. Above the shoes was a card, saying simply,--      PUT US ON.    So Bobo sat down on a stone by the foot of the tree, and put on the  wooden shoes, which fitted him very nicely. Now these shoes were magic  shoes, and Bobo had hardly stepped into them before they turned his feet  inland. So Bobo obediently let the shoes guide him. At corners the shoes  always turned in the right direction, and if Bobo forgot and blundered  on the wrong way, the shoes swiftly began to pinch his toes.    For two days Bobo walked inland toward the great mountain. A warm wind  blew the clouds and rain away, the sun shone sweet and clear. On the  morning of the third day, the simpleton entered a wood of tall silent  trees, and as that day was drawing to a close, turrets of a magnificent  castle rose far away over the leaves of the forest.    Bobo arrived at twilight.    He found himself in a beautiful garden, lying between the castle walls  and the rising slopes of a great mountain. Strange to say, not a living  creature was to be seen, and though there were lights in the castle,  there was not even a warder at the gate. Suddenly a great booming bell  struck seven o'clock; Bobo began to hear voices and sounds; and then,  before the humming of the bell had died away, a youth mounted on a  splendid black horse dashed at lightning speed out of the castle and  disappeared in the wood. An old man with a white beard, accompanied by  eleven young men, whom Bobo judged, from their expressions, to be  brothers,--stood by the gate to see the horseman ride away.    Plucking up courage, Bobo came forward, fell on his knee before the old  man, and told his story.    \"Truly, you should thank the storm fairies,\" said the old man; \"for had  you not been wrecked upon this island, never would you have discovered  the lost half-hour. I am Father Time himself, and these are my twelve  sons, the Hours. Every day, one after the other, they ride for an hour  round the whole wide world. Seven O'clock has just ridden forth. Yes,  you shall have the lost half-hour, but you must look after my sons'  horses for the space of a whole year.\"    To this Bobo willingly agreed. So Twelve O'Clock, who was the youngest  of the Hours, took him to the stables and showed him the little room in  the turret that he was to have. And thus for a year Bobo served Father  Time and his sons. He took such good care of the great black horses of  the Hours of the Night, and the white horses of the Hours of the Day,  that they were never more proud and strong, nor their coats smoother and  more gleaming.    When the year was up, Bobo again sought out Father Time.    \"You have served faithfully and well,\" said Father Time. \"Here is your  reward.\" And, with these words, he placed in Bobo's hands a small square  casket made of ebony. \"The half-hour lies inside. Don't try to peek at it  or open the box until the right time has come. If you do, the half-hour  will flyaway and disappear forever.\"    \"Farewell, Bobo,\" said kind young Twelve O'Clock, who had been the  simpleton's good friend. \"I, too, have a gift for thee. Drink this cup  of water to the last drop.\" And the youth handed the simpleton a silver  cup full to the brim of clear shining water.    Now this water was the water of wisdom, and when Bobo had drunk it, he  was no longer a simpleton. And being no longer a simpleton, he  remembered the man who had lost his reputation, the man who had lost his  temper, and the king whose daughter had been stolen by the fairies. So  Bobo made so bold as to ask Father Time about them, for Father Time  knows everything that has happened in the whole wide world.    \"Tell the first,\" said Father Time, \"that his reputation has been broken  into a thousand pieces which have been picked up by his neighbors and  carried home. If he can persuade his neighbors to give them up, he  should be able to piece together a pretty good reputation again. As for  the man who lost his temper, tell him that it is to be found in the  grass by the roadside close by the spot where you first met him. As for  the missing daughter, she is the kitchen-maid in Princess Zenza's  palace, who is known as Tilda.\"    So Bobo thanked Father Time, and at noon, Twelve O'Clock placed him  behind him on the white charger, and hurried away. So fast they flew  that Bobo, who was holding the ebony casket close against his heart, was  in great danger of falling off. When they got to the seashore, the white  horse hesitated not an instant, but set foot upon the water, which bore  him up as if it had been, not water, but earth itself. Once arrived at  the shore of Fairyland, Twelve O'Clock stopped, wished Bobo good-speed,  and, rising in the air, disappeared into the glare of the sun. Bobo,  with the precious ebony casket in his hand, continued on in the  direction of Princess Zenza's palace.    On the second morning of his journey, he happened to see far ahead of  him on the highway the unfortunate aged man who had lost his reputation.  To him, therefore, Bobo repeated the counsel of Father Time, and sent  him hurrying home to his neighbors' houses. Of the man who had lost his  temper, Bobo found no sign. In the grass by the roadside, however, he  did find the lost temper--a queer sort of affair like a melon of fiery  red glass all stuck over with uneven spines and brittle thorns. Bobo,  with great goodness of heart, took along this extraordinary object, in  the hope of finding its angry possessor.    Farther on, the lad encountered Tilda's father, the unhappy King, and  delivered his message. The joy of the monarch knew no bounds, and Bobo,  the one-time simpleton, became on the spot Lord Bobo of the Sapphire  Hills, Marquis of the Mountains of the Moon, Prince of the Valley of  Golden Apples, and Lord Seneschal of the proud City of Zizz--in a word,  the greatest nobleman in all Fairyland. Then, having got together a  magnificent cohort of dukes, earls, and counts, all in splendid silks,  and soldiers in shining armor, the delighted King rode off to claim his  missing daughter from Princess Zenza.    So on they rode, the harnesses jingling, the bridle-bells ringing, and  the breastplates of the armed men shining in the sun. After a week of  almost constant progress (for the King was so anxious to see his beloved  daughter that he would hardly give the cavalcade time to rest), they  came to the frontiers of Princess Zenza's kingdom.    Strange to say, black mourning banners hung from the trees, and every  door in the first village which the travelers saw was likewise hung with  black streamers. On the steps of one of the cottages sat an old woman,  all alone and weeping with all her might.    \"What is the matter, my good woman?\" said the King.    \"O sir,\" said the peasant woman, \"evil days have fallen upon our unhappy  kingdom. Three days ago a terrible dragon alighted in the gardens of the  palace and sent word to Princess Zenza that if within three days she did  not provide him with someone brave enough to go home with him and cook  his meals and keep his cavern tidy, he would burn our fields with his  fiery breath. Yet who, I ask you, would be housekeeper for a dragon?  Suppose he did n't like the puddings you made for him--why, he might eat  you up! All would have been lost had not a brave little kitchen-maid  named Tilda volunteered to go. It is for her that we are mourning. At  two o'clock she is to be carried off by the dragon. It is almost two  now. Alas! Alas!\"    Hardly were the words out of her mouth, when the town bell struck twice,  solemnly and sadly.    \"Quick! quick!\" cried the King and Bobo in the same breath, \"Let us  hurry to the castle. We may save her yet.\"    But they knew in their hearts that they were too late, and that poor  Tilda had given herself to the dragon. And so it proved. In spite of his  mad dash, Bobo, who had spurred on ahead, arrived exactly half an hour  late. The monstrous dragon with Tilda in his claws was just a little  smoky speck far down the southern sky. Princess Zenza and her court  stood by wringing their jeweled hands.    Suddenly Bobo thought of the half-hour. He had arrived half an hour  late, but he could have that half-hour back again! Things should be  exactly as they were half an hour before.    He opened the cover of the ebony box. Something like a winged white  flame escaped from it, and flew hissing through the air to the sun. As  for the sun itself, turning round like a cartwheel and"]]]
