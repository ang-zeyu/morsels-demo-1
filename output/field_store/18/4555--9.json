The black fly exists in  the neighbourhood of rivers or swamps, and attacks you behind the ear,  drawing a pretty copious supply of blood at each bite. The sand-fly, as  its name imports, exists in sandy soil, and is so small that it cannot  be seen without close inspection; its bite is sharp and fiery.    Then the farmer has the wheat-fly and the turnip-fly to contend against;  the former has actually devoured Lower Canada, and the latter has  obliged me in a garden to sow several successive crops. The melon-bug is  another nuisance; it is a small winged animal, of a bright yellow  colour, striped with black bars, and takes up its abode in the flower of  the melon and pumpkin, breeding fast, and destroying wherever it  settles, for young plants are literally eaten up by it.    The grub, living under ground in the daytime, and sallying forth at  night, is a ferocious enemy to cabbage-plants, lettuce, and most of the  young, tender vegetables; but, by taking a lantern and a pan after dark,  the gentlemen can be collected whilst on their tour, and poultry are  very fond of them. Last year, the potato crop failed throughout Canada.  What a singular dispensation!--for it alike suffered in Europe, and no  doubt the malady was atmospheric. The hay crop, too, suffered severely;  but still, by a merciful Providence, the wheat and corn harvest was  ample, and gathered in a month before the customary time.    By the word corn I mean oats, rye, and barley; but in the Canadas and in  the United States that word means maize or Indian-corn only, which in  Canada, last summer, was not, I should think, even an average crop. It  is extensively used here for food, as well as buckwheat, and for feeding  poultry.    But to our journey westward. I arrived at Toronto on the 27th of June,  and found the weather had changed to variable and fine.    On steaming up the harbour, I was greatly surprised and very much  pleased to see such an alteration as Toronto has undergone for the  better since 1837. Then, although a flourishing village, be-citied, to  be sure, it was not one third of its present size. Now it is a city in  earnest, with upwards of twenty thousand inhabitants--gas-lit, with good  plank side-walks and macadamized streets, and with vast sewers, and fine  houses, of brick or stone. The main street, King Street, is two miles  and more in length, and would not do shame to any town, and has a much  more English look than most Canadian places have.    Toronto is still the seat of the Courts of Law for Western Canada, of  the University of King's College, of the Bishopric of Toronto, and of  the Indian Office. Kingston has retained the militia head-quarter  office, and the Principal Emigrant Agency, with the Naval and Military  grand depots; so that the removal of the seat of Government to Montreal  has done no injury to Toronto, and will do very little to Kingston: in  fact, I believe firmly that, instead of being injurious, it will be very  beneficial. The presence of Government at Kingston gave an unnatural  stimulus to speculation among a population very far from wealthy; and  buildings of the most frail construction were run up in hundreds, for  the sake of the rent which they yielded temporarily.    The plan upon which these houses were erected was that of mortgage; thus  almost all are now in possession of one person who became suddenly  possessed of the requisite means by the sale of a large tract required  for military purposes. But this species of property seldom does the  owner good in his lifetime; and, if he does reclaim it, there is no  tenant to be had now; so that the building decays, and in a very short  time becomes an incumbrance. Mortgages only thrive where the demand is  superior and certain to the investment; and then, if all goes smoothly,  mortgager and mortgagee may benefit; but where a mechanic or a  storekeeper, with little or no capital, undertakes to run up an  extensive range of houses to meet an equivocal demand, the result is  obvious. If the houses he builds are of stone or brick, and well  finished, the man who loans the money is the gainer; if they are of  wood, indifferently constructed and of green materials, both must  suffer. So it is a speculation, and, like all speculations, a good deal  of repudiation mixes up with it.    There are two good houses of entertainment for the gentleman traveller  in Toronto; the Club House in Chewett's Buildings and Macdonald's Hotel.  In the former, a bachelor will find himself quite at home; in the  latter, a family man will have no reason to regret his stay.    But servants at Toronto--by which I mean _attendants_--are about on a  par with the same race all over Canada. The coloured people are the  best, but never make yourself dependent on either; for, if you are to  start by the stage or the steamer, depend on your watch, instead of upon  your boots being cleaned or your shaving-water being ready. In the  latter case, shave with cold water by the light of your candle, lit by  your own lucifer match. They are civil, however, and attentive, as far  as the very free and easy style of their acquirements will permit them;  for a cook will leave at a moment's notice, if she can better herself;  and any trivial occurrence will call off the waiter and the boots. The  only punctual people are the porters; and, as they wear glazed hats,  with the name of the hotel emblazoned thereon, frigate-fashion, you can  always find them.    An excellent arrangement is the omnibus attached to the hotels in Canada  West, which conveys you cost-free to and from the steamboat, and a very  comfortable wooden convenience it is, resembling very much the vans  which, in days of yore, plied near London.    My first start from Toronto was to Ultima Thule, Penetanguishene, a  locality scarcely to be found in the maps, and yet one of much  importance, situate and being north-north-west of the city some hundred  and eight miles, on Lake Huron.    The route is per coach to St. Alban's, thirty and three miles, along  Yonge Street, of which about one-third is macadamized from granite  boulders; the rest mud and etceteras, too numerous to mention. Yonge  Street is a continuous settlement, with an occasional sprinkling of the  original forest. The land on each side is fertile, and supplies Toronto  market.    It rises gradually by those singular steps, or ridges, formerly banks or  shores oL antediluvian oceans, till it reaches the vicinity of the  Holland river, a tortuous, sluggish, marshy, natural canal, flowing or  lazily creeping into Lake Simcoe, at an elevation of upwards of  seven-hundred and fifty feet above Lake Ontario, and emptying itself  into Lake Huron by a series of rapids, called the Matchedash or Severn  River.    The first quarter of the route to St. Alban's is a series of  country-houses, gentlemen's seats, half-pay officers' farms, prettily  fenced, and pleasant to the sight: the next third embraces Thornhill, a  nice village in a hollow; Richmond Hill, with a beautiful prospect and  detached settlements: the ultimate third is a rich, undulating country,  inhabited by well-to-do Quakers, with Newmarket on their right, and  looking for all the world very like \"dear home,\" with orchards, and as  rich corn-fields and pastures as may be seen any where, backed,  however, by the eternal forest. It is peculiarly and particularly  beautiful.    A short distance before reaching St. Alban's, which is quite a new  village, the road descends rapidly, and the ground is broken into  hummocks.    But I must not forget Bond's Lake, a most singular feature of this part  of the road, which, perhaps, I shall treat of in returning from  Penetanguishene, as I am now in a hurry to get to St. Alban's.    Here, where all was scrub forest in 1837, are a little street, a house  of some pretension occupied by Mr. Laughton, the enterprising owner of  the Beaver steamboat, plying on Lake Simcoe, and two inns.    I stopped for the night, for Yonge Street is still a tiresome journey,  although only a stage of thirty three miles, at Winch's Tavern. This is  a very good road-side house, and the landlord and landlady are civil and  attentive. Before you go to roost, for stopping by the way-side is  pretty much like roosting, as you must be up with Chanticleer, you can  just look over Mr. Laughton's paling, and you will see as pretty a  florist's display as may be imagined. The owner is fond of flowers, and  he has lots of them, and, when you make his acquaintance afterwards in  the Beaver, you will find that he has lots of information also. But I  did not go in the Beaver, which ship \"wharfs\" some two or three miles  further ahead, at Holland River Landing, commonly called \"the Landing,\"  par excellence. Here flies, mosquitoes, ague, and other plagues, are so  rife, that all attempts at settlement are vanity and vexation of spirit.    So, being willing to see what had happened in Gwillimbury since 1837, I  took a waggon and the land road, and went off as day broke, or rather  before it broke, about four a.m., in a deep gray mist. The waggon should  be described, as it is the best _voiture_ in Western Canada.    Four wheels, of a narrow tire, are attached without any springs to a  long body, formed of straight boards, like a piano-case, only more  clumsy; in which, resting on inside rims or battens, are two seats, with  or without backs, generally without, on which, perhaps, a hay-cushion,  or a buffalo-skin, or both, are placed. Two horses, good, bad, or  indifferent, as the case may be, the positive and comparative degrees  being the commonest, drag you along with a clever driver, who can turn  his hand to chopping, carpentering, wheelwright's work, playing the  fiddle, drinking, or any other sort of thing, and is usually an Irishman  or an Irishman's son. For two dollars and a half a day he will drive you  to Melville Island, or Parry's Sound, if you will only stick by him; and  he jogs along,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20023"],[0,"The Letters of Queen Victoria : A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence (#12)"],[1,"EKEN, _21st May 1833._    MY DEAREST LOVE,--To make quite sure of my birthday congratulations  reaching you on that day, I send them by to-day's messenger, and  confide them to the care of your illustrious mother.    My sincere good wishes for many happy returns of that day which  gave you, dear little soul, to us, will be accompanied by some few  reflections, which the serious aspect of our times calls forth.  My dearest Love, you are now fourteen years old, a period when  the delightful pastimes of childhood must be mixed with thoughts  appertaining already to a matured part of your life. I know that you  have been very studious, but now comes the time when the judgment must  form itself, when the character requires attention; in short when the  young tree takes the shape which it retains afterwards through life.    To attain this object it is indispensable to give some little time _to  reflection_. The life in a great town is little calculated for such  purposes; however, with some firmness of purpose it can be done.    _Self-examination_ is the most important part of the business, and  a very useful mode of proceeding is, for instance, every evening to  recapitulate the events of the day, and the motives which made one act  oneself, as well as to try to guess what might have been the motives  of others. Amiable dispositions like yours will easily perceive  if your own motives _were good_. Persons in high situations must  particularly guard themselves against selfishness and vanity. An  individual in a high and important situation will easily see a great  many persons eager to please the first, and to flatter and encourage  the last. Selfishness, however, makes the individual itself miserable,  and is the cause of constant disappointment, besides being the surest  means of being disliked by everybody.    Vanity, on the other hand, is generally artfully used by ambitious and  interested people to make one a tool for purposes of their own, but  too often in opposition with one's own happiness and destruction of  it.    To learn to know oneself, to judge oneself with truth and  impartiality, must be the great objects of one's exertion; they are  only attainable by constant and cool self-examination.    The position of what is generally called great people has of late  become extremely difficult. They are more attacked and calumniated,  and judged with less indulgence than private individuals. What they  have lost in this way, they have not by any means regained in any  other. Ever since the revolution of 1790 they are much less secure  than they used to be, and the transition from sovereign power to  _absolute want_ has been as frequent as sudden.    It becomes, therefore, necessary that the character should be so  formed as not to be intoxicated by greatness and success, nor  cast down by misfortune. To be able to do so, one must be able to  appreciate things according to their real value, and particularly  avoid giving to trifles an undue importance.    Nothing is so great and clear a proof of unfitness for greater and  nobler actions, than a mind which is seriously occupied with trifles.    Trifling matters may be objects of amusement and relaxation to a  clever person, but only a weak mind and a mean spirit consider trifles  as important. The good sense must show itself by distinguishing what  is and what is not important.    My sermon is now long enough, my dear child. I strongly recommend it,  however, to your reflection and consideration.    My gift consists in a set of views of the former Kingdom of the  Netherlands, out of which you will be able to discover all those of  the present Belgium.    Let me soon hear from you; and may God bless and preserve you. Ever,  my dear Love, your affectionate Uncle,    LEOPOLD R.          [Pageheading: VISIT TO HEVER CASTLE]      _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    TUNBRIDGE WELLS, _14th September 1834._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--Allow me to write you a few words, to express  how thankful I am for the very kind letter you wrote me. It made me,  though, very sad to think that all our hopes of seeing you, which we  cherished so long, this year, were over. I had so hoped and wished to  have seen you again, my _beloved_ Uncle, and to have made dearest  Aunt Louisa's acquaintance. I am delighted to hear that dear Aunt has  benefited from the sea air and bathing. We had a very pretty party to  Hever Castle yesterday, which perhaps you remember, where Anne Boleyn  used to live, _before she lost her head_. We drove there, and rode  home. It was a most beautiful day. We have very good accounts from  dear Feodore, who will, by this time, be at Langenburg.    Believe me always, my dearest Uncle, your very affectionate and  dutiful Niece,    VICTORIA.          [Pageheading: HISTORICAL READING]      _The King of the Belgians to the Princess Victoria._    LAEKEN, _18th October 1834._    MY DEAREST LOVE,--I am happy to learn that Tunbridge Wells has done  you good. Health is the first and most important gift of Providence;  without it we are poor, miserable creatures, though the whole earth  were our property; therefore I trust that you will take great care of  your own. I feel convinced that air and exercise are most useful for  you. In your leisure moments I hope that you study a little; history  is what I think the most important study for you. It will be difficult  for you to learn human-kind's ways and manners otherwise than from  that important source of knowledge. Your position will more or less  render practical knowledge extremely difficult for you, till you get  old, and still if you do not prepare yourself for your position, you  may become the victim of wicked and designing people, particularly at  a period when party spirit runs so high. Our times resemble most those  of the Protestant reformation; then people were moved by religious  opinions, as they now undoubtedly are by political passions.  Unfortunately history is rarely written by those who really were  the chief movers of events, nor free from a party colouring; this  is particularly the case in the works about English history. In that  respect France is much richer, because there we have authenticated  memoirs of some of the most important men, and of others who really  saw what passed and wrote it down at the time. Political feelings,  besides, rarely created _permanent_ parties like those in England,  with the exception, perhaps, of the great distinctions of Catholics  and Protestants. What I most should recommend is the period before the  accession of Henry IV. of France to the throne, then the events after  his death till the end of the minority of Louis XIV.; after that  period, though interesting, matters have a character which is more  personal, and therefore less applicable to the present times. Still  even that period may be studied with some profit to get knowledge of  mankind. _Intrigues_ and _favouritism_ were the chief features of that  period, and Madame de Maintenon's immense influence was very nearly  the cause of the destruction of France. What I very particularly  recommend to you is to study in the Memoirs of the great and good  Sully[12] the last years of the reign of Henry IV. of France, and the  events which followed his assassination. If you have not got the work,  I will forward it to you from hence, or give you the edition which I  must have at Claremont.    As my paper draws to a close, I shall finish also by giving you my  best blessings, and remain ever, my dearest Love, your faithfully  attached Friend and Uncle,    LEOPOLD R.        [Footnote 12: Maximilien, Duc de Sully, was Henry's Minister      of Finance. A curious feature of the Memoirs is the fact that      they are written in the second person: the historian recounts      the hero's adventures to him.]          [Pageheading: THE PRINCESS'S READING]      _The Princess Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    TUNBRIDGE WELLS, _22nd October 1834._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--You cannot conceive how happy you have made me, by  your very kind letter, which, instead of tiring, delights me beyond  everything. I must likewise say how very grateful I feel for the kind  and excellent advice you gave me in it.    For the autographs I beg to return my best thanks. They are  most valuable and interesting, and will be great additions to my  collections. As I have not got Sully's Memoirs, I shall be delighted  if you will be so good as to give them to me. Reading history is one  of my greatest delights, and perhaps, dear Uncle, you might like to  know which books in that line I am now reading. In my lessons with the  Dean of Chester,[13] I am reading Russell's _Modern Europe_,[14] which  is very interesting, and Clarendon's _History of the Rebellion_. It  is drily written, but is full of instruction. I like reading different  authors, of different opinions, by which means I learn not to lean on  one particular side. Besides my lessons, I read Jones'[15] account  of the wars in Spain, Portugal and the South of France, from the year  1808 till 1814. It is well done, I think, and amuses me very much. In  French, I am now in _La Rivalite de la France et de l'Espagne_, par  Gaillard,[16] which is very interesting. I have also begun Rollin.[17]  I am very fond of making tables of the Kings and Queens, as I go on,  and I have lately finished one of the English Sovereigns and their  consorts, as, of course, the history of my own country is one of  my first duties. I should be fearful of tiring you with so long an  account of myself, were I not sure you take so great an interest in my  welfare.    Pray give my most affectionate love to _dearest_ Aunt Louisa, and  please say to the Queen of the French and the two Princesses how  grateful I am for their kind remembrance of me.    Believe me always, my dearest Uncle, your very affectionate, very  dutiful, and most attached Niece,    VICTORIA.        [Footnote 13: The Rev. George Davys."]]]
