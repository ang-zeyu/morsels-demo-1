He thought it such a good joke that he couldn't keep it to  himself, so when he saw Little Joe Otter coming to try his slippery  slide he swam across to tell him all about it.  Little Joe Otter  laughed and laughed until he had to hold his sides.  Then they both  swam back to hide behind the Big Rock to watch until Grandfather Frog  should forget all about it, and they could play the trick over again.    Now, out of the corner of one of his big goggly eyes, Grandfather Frog  had seen Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter with their heads close  together, laughing and holding their sides, and he saw them swim over  behind the Big Rock.  Pretty soon one of the Merry Little Breezes  danced over to see if Grandfather Frog had really gone to sleep.  Grandfather Frog didn't move, not the teeniest, weeniest bit, but he  whispered something to the Merry Little Breeze, and the Merry Little  Breeze flew away, shaking with laughter, to where the other Merry  Little Breezes were playing with the buttercups and daisies.    Then all the Merry Little Breezes clapped their hands and laughed too.  They left the buttercups and daisies and began to play tag across the  Smiling Pool.    Now, right on the edge of the Big Rock lay a big stick.  Pretty soon  the Merry Little Breezes danced over to the Big Rock, and then,  suddenly, all together they gave the big stick a push.  Off it went,  and then such a splashing and squealing as there was behind the Big  Rock!    In a few moments Little Joe Otter crept out beside his slippery slide  and slipped away holding on to his head.  And, sneaking through the  bulrushes, so as not to be seen, crawled Billy Mink, back towards his  home on the Laughing Brook.  Billy Mink wasn't laughing now.  Oh, no!  He was limping and he was holding on to his head.  Little Joe Otter and  Billy Mink had been sitting right underneath the big stick.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog and held on to his sides and opened  his mouth very wide in a noiseless laugh, for Grandfather Frog never  makes a sound when he laughs.    \"Chug-a-rum!\" said Grandfather Frog once more.  Then he folded his  hands across his white and yellow waistcoat and began again to dream of  the days when the frogs had long tails and ruled the world.          XI    THE DISAPPOINTED BUSH    Way down beside the Laughing Brook grew a little bush.  It looked a  whole lot like other little bushes all around it.  But really it was  quite different, as you shall see.  When in the spring warm, jolly,  round Mr. Sun brought back the birds and set them singing, when the  little flowers popped their heads out of the ground to have a look  around, then all the little bushes put out their green leaves.    This little bush of which I am telling you put out its green leaves  with the rest.  The little leaves grew bigger and bigger on all the  little bushes.  By and by on some of the other little bushes, little  brown buds began to appear and grow and grow.  Then on more and more of  the little bushes the little brown buds came and grew and grew.  But on  this little bush of which I am telling you no little brown buds  appeared.  The little bush felt very sad indeed.    Pretty soon all the little brown buds on the other little brown bushes  burst their brown coats, and then all the little bushes were covered  with little flowers.  Some were white and some were yellow and some  were pink; and the air was filled with the sweet odor of all the little  flowers.  It brought the bees from far, far away to gather the honey,  and all the little bushes were very happy indeed.    But the little bush of which I am telling you had no little flowers,  for you see it had had no little buds, and it felt lonely and shut away  from the other little bushes, and very sad indeed.  But it bravely kept  on growing and growing and growing.  Its little leaves grew bigger and  bigger and bigger, and it tried its best not to mind because it had no  little flowers.    Then one by one, and two by two, and three by three, and finally in  whole showers, the little flowers of all the other little bushes fell  off, and they looked very much like the little bush of which I am  telling you, so that the little bush no longer felt sad.    All summer long all the little bushes grew and grew and grew.  The  birds came and built their nests among them.  Peter Rabbit and his  brothers and sisters scampered under them.  The butterflies flew over  them.    By and by came the fall, and with the fall came Jack Frost.  He went  about among the little bushes, pinching the leaves.  Then the little  green leaves turned to brown and red and yellow and pretty soon they  fluttered down to the ground, the Merry Little Breezes blew them about  and all the little bushes were bare.  They had no leaves at all to  cover their little naked brown limbs.    The little bush of which I am telling you lost its leaves with the  rest.  But all the summer long this little bush had been growing some  of those little brown buds, which the other bushes had had in the  spring, and now, when all the other little bushes had lost all the  green leaves, and had nothing at all upon their little brown twigs,  behold! one beautiful day, the little bush of which I am telling you  was covered with gold, for each little brown bud had burst its little  brown coat and there was a beautiful little yellow flower.  Such a  multitude of these little yellow flowers!  They covered the little bush  from top to bottom.  Then the little bush felt very happy indeed, for  it was the only bush which had any flowers.  And every one who passed  that way stopped to look at it and to praise it.    Colder grew the weather and colder.  Johnny Chuck tucked himself away  to sleep all winter.  Grandfather Frog went deep, deep down in the mud,  not to come out again until spring.  By and by the little yellow  flowers dropped off the little bush, just as the other little flowers  in spring had dropped off the other bushes.  But they left behind them  tiny little packages, one for every little flower that had been on the  bush.  All winter long these little packages clung to the little bush.  In the spring when the little leaves burst forth in all the little  bushes, these little packages on the little bush of which I am telling  you grew and grew and grew.  While the other little bushes had a lot of  little flowers as they had had the year before, these little brown  packages on the little bush of which I am telling you kept on growing.  And they comforted the little bush because it felt that it really had  something worth while.    All the summer long the little brown packages grew and grew until they  looked like little nuts.  When the fall came again and all the little  leaves dropped off all the little bushes, and the little bush of which  I am telling you was covered with another lot of little yellow flowers  and was very happy, then these little brown nuts, one bright autumn  day, suddenly popped open!  And out of each one flew two brown shiny  little seeds.  You never saw such a popping and a snapping and a  jumping!  Pop! pop! snap! snap! hippetty hop! they went, faster than  the corn pops in the corn popper.  Reddy Fox, who always is suspicious,  thought some one was shooting at him.  Down on the ground fell the  little brown shining seeds and tucked themselves into the warm earth  under the warm leaves, there to stay all winter long.    And when the third spring came with all its little birds and all its  little flowers and the warm sunshine, every one of these little brown  seeds which had tucked themselves into the warm earth, burst its little  brown skin, and up into the sunshine came a little green plant, which  would grow and grow and grow, and by and by become just like the little  bush I am telling you about.    When the little bush looked down and saw all these little green  children popping out of the ground, it was very happy indeed, for it  knew that it would no longer be lonely.  It no longer felt bad when all  the other bushes were covered with flowers, for it knew that by and by  when all the other little bushes had lost all their leaves and all  their flowers, then would come its turn, and it knew that for a whole  year its little brown children would be held safe on its branches.    Now, what do you think is the name of this little bush?  Why, it is the  witch hazel.  And sometime when you fall down and bump yourself hard  grandma will go to the medicine closet and will bring out a bottle, and  from that bottle she will pour something on that little sore place and  it will make it feel better.  Do you know what it is?  It is the gift  of the witch hazel bush to little boys and big men to make them feel  better when they are hurt.          XII    WHY BOBBY COON WASHES HIS FOOD    Happy-Go-Lucky Bobby Coon sat on the edge of the Laughing Brook just as  round, red Mr. Sun popped up from behind the Purple Hills and Old  Mother West Wind turned all her Merry Little Breezes out to romp on the  Green Meadows.    Bobby Coon had been out all night.  You see Bobby Coon is very apt to  get into mischief, and because usually it is safer to get into mischief  under cover of the darkness Bobby Coon prefers the night wherein to go  abroad.  Not that Bobby Coon is really bad!  Oh my, no!  Everybody  likes Bobby Coon.  But he can no more keep out of mischief than a duck  can keep out of water.    So Bobby Coon sat on the edge of the Laughing Brook and he was very  busy, very busy indeed.  He was washing his breakfast.  Really, it was  his dinner, for turning night into day just turns everything  topsy-turvy.  So Bobby Coon eats dinner when most of the little meadow  people are eating breakfast.    This morning he was very busy washing a luscious ear of sweet corn just  in the milk.  He dipped it in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20885"],[0,"The Promised Land (#12)"],[1," to be firm, lest their flesh and  blood be cheated under their noses. The meddlesome cousin was silenced  at last, the contract was signed, the happiness of the engaged couple  was pledged in wine, the guests dispersed. And all this while my  mother had not opened her mouth, and my father had scarcely been  heard.    That is the way my fate was sealed. It gives me a shudder of wonder to  think what a narrow escape I had; I came so near not being born at  all. If the beggarly cousin with the frowzy wig had prevailed upon her  family and broken off the match, then my mother would not have married  my father, and I should at this moment be an unborn possibility in a  philosopher's brain. It is right that I should pick my words most  carefully, and meditate over every comma, because I am describing  miracles too great for careless utterance. If I had died after my  first breath, my history would still be worth recording. For before I  could lie on my mother's breast, the earth had to be prepared, and the  stars had to take their places; a million races had to die, testing  the laws of life; and a boy and girl had to be bound for life to watch  together for my coming. I was millions of years on the way, and I came  through the seas of chance, over the fiery mountain of law, by the  zigzag path of human possibility. Multitudes were pushed back into the  abyss of non-existence, that I should have way to creep into being.  And at the last, when I stood at the gate of life, a weazen-faced  fishwife, who had not wit enough to support herself, came near  shutting me out.    Such creatures of accident are we, liable to a thousand deaths before  we are born. But once we are here, we may create our own world, if we  choose. Since I have stood on my own feet, I have never met my master.  For every time I choose a friend I determine my fate anew. I can think  of no cataclysm that could have the force to move me from my path.  Fire or flood or the envy of men may tear the roof off my house, but  my soul would still be at home under the lofty mountain pines that dip  their heads in star dust. Even life, that was so difficult to attain,  may serve me merely as a wayside inn, if I choose to go on eternally.  However I came here, it is mine to be.          CHAPTER IV    DAILY BREAD      My mother ought to have been happy in her engagement. Everybody  congratulated her on securing such a scholar, her parents loaded her  with presents, and her friends envied her. It is true that the  hossen's family consisted entirely of poor relations; there was not  one solid householder among them. From the worldly point of view my  mother made a mesalliance. But as one of my aunts put it, when my  mother objected to the association with the undesirable cousins, she  could take out the cow and set fire to the barn; meaning that she  could rejoice in the hossen and disregard his family.    The hossen, on his part, had reason to rejoice, without any  reservations. He was going into a highly respectable family, with a  name supported by property and business standing. The promised dowry  was considerable, the presents were generous, the trousseau would be  liberal, and the bride was fair and capable. The bridegroom would have  years before him in which he need do nothing but eat free board, wear  his new clothes, and study Torah; and his poor relations could hold up  their heads at the market stalls, and in the rear pews in the  synagogue.    My mother's trousseau was all that a mother-in-law could wish. The  best tailor in Polotzk was engaged to make the cloaks and gowns, and  his shop was filled to bursting with ample lengths of velvet and satin  and silk. The wedding gown alone cost every kopeck of fifty rubles,  as the tailor's wife reported all over Polotzk. The lingerie was of  the best, and the seamstress was engaged on it for many weeks.  Featherbeds, linen, household goods of every sort--everything was  provided in abundance. My mother crocheted many yards of lace to trim  the best sheets, and fine silk coverlets adorned the plump beds. Many  a marriageable maiden who came to view the trousseau went home to  prink and blush and watch for the shadchan.    The wedding was memorable for gayety and splendor. The guests included  some of the finest people in Polotzk; for while my grandfather was not  quite at the top of the social scale, he had business connections with  those that were, and they all turned out for the wedding of his only  daughter, the men in silk frock coats, the women in all their jewelry.    The bridegroom's aunts and cousins came in full force. Wedding  messengers had been sent to every person who could possibly claim  relationship with the hossen. My mother's parents were too generous to  slight the lowliest. Instead of burning the barn, they did all they  could to garnish it. One or two of the more important of the poor  relations came to the wedding in gowns paid for by my rich  grandfather. The rest came decked out in borrowed finery, or in  undisguised shabbiness. But nobody thought of staying away--except the  obstructive cousin who had nearly prevented the match.    When it was time to conduct the bride to the wedding canopy, the  bridegroom's mother missed Henne Roesel. The house was searched for  her, but in vain. Nobody had seen her. But my grandmother could not  bear to have the marriage solemnized in the absence of a first  cousin. Such a wedding as this was not likely to be repeated in her  family; it would be a great pity if any of the relatives missed it. So  she petitioned the principals to delay the ceremony, while she herself  went in search of the missing cousin.    Clear over to the farthest end of the town she walked, lifting her  gala dress well above her ankles. She found Henne Roesel in her untidy  kitchen, sound in every limb but sulky in spirit. My grandmother  exclaimed at her conduct, and bade her hurry with her toilet, and  accompany her; the wedding guests were waiting; the bride was faint  from prolonging her fast. But Henne Roesel flatly refused to go; the  bride might remain an old maid, for all she, Henne Roesel, cared about  the wedding. My troubled grandmother expostulated, questioned her,  till she drew out the root of the cousin's sulkiness. Henne Roesel  complained that she had not been properly invited. The wedding  messenger had come,--oh, yes!--but she had not addressed her as  flatteringly, as respectfully as she had been heard to address the  wife of Yohem, the money-lender. And Henne Roesel wasn't going to any  weddings where she was not wanted. My grandmother had a struggle of  it, but she succeeded in soothing the sensitive cousin, who consented  at length to don her best dress and go to the wedding.    While my grandmother labored with Henne Roesel, the bride sat in state  in her father's house under the hill, the maidens danced, and the  matrons fanned themselves, while the fiddlers and _zimblers_ scraped  and tinkled. But as the hours went by, the matrons became restless and  the dancers wearied. The poor relations grew impatient for the feast,  and the babies in their laps began to fidget and cry; while the bride  grew faint, and the bridegroom's party began to send frequent  messengers from the house next door, demanding to know the cause of  the delay. Some of the guests at last lost all patience, and begged  leave to go home. But before they went they deposited the wedding  presents in the bride's satin lap, till she resembled a heathen image  hung about with offerings.    My mother, after thirty years of bustling life, retains a lively  memory of the embarrassment she suffered while waiting for the arrival  of the troublesome cousin. When that important dame at last appeared,  with her chin in the air, the artificial flower still stuck  belligerently into her dusty wig, and my grandmother beaming behind  her, the bride's heart fairly jumped with anger, and the red blood of  indignation set her cheeks afire. No wonder that she speaks the name  of the Red-Flower with an unloving accent to this day, although she  has forgiven the enemies who did her greater wrong. The bride is a  princess on her wedding day. To put upon her an indignity is an  unpardonable offense.    After the feasting and dancing, which lasted a whole week, the wedding  presents were locked up, the bride, with her hair discreetly covered,  returned to her father's store, and the groom, with his new  praying-shawl, repaired to the synagogue. This was all according to  the marriage bargain, which implied that my father was to study and  pray and fill the house with the spirit of piety, in return for board  and lodging and the devotion of his wife and her entire family.    All the parties concerned had entered into this bargain in good faith,  so far as they knew their own minds. But the eighteen-year-old  bridegroom, before many months had passed, began to realize that he  felt no such hunger for the word of the Law as he was supposed to  feel. He felt, rather, a hunger for life that all his studying did not  satisfy. He was not trained enough to analyze his own thoughts to any  purpose; he was not experienced enough to understand where his  thoughts were leading him. He only knew that he felt no call to pray  and fast that the Torah did not inspire him, and his days were blank.  The life he was expected to lead grew distasteful to him, and yet he  knew no other way to live. He became lax in his attendance at the  synagogue, incurring the reproach of the family. It began to be  rumored among the studious that the son-in-law of Raphael the Russian  was not devoting himself to the sacred books with any degree of  enthusiasm. It was well known that he had a good mind, but evidently  the spirit was lacking. My grandparents went from surprise to  indignation, from exhortation they passed to recrimination. Before my  parents had been married half a year, my grandfather's house was  divided against itself and"]]]
