When I came away, he was still lying insensible.  His wife and daughter are, happily, uninjured.\"    \"Was anyone else hurt?\"    \"Yes, sire, the six menservants who were sleeping in the house were  all killed--four in their beds, two while hastening from below to  assist their master.\"    The king gave an exclamation of fury.    \"You said these men belonged to a Pomeranian regiment. Had they  left before you got there? But I suppose not, or else you would not  have been wounded. How was it that you heard of the attack?\"    \"I had carried a despatch from the marshal to the camp, sire, and  was on my way back when I heard a pistol shot. The sound was faint,  for it came from a house a quarter of a mile away, and was fired  indoors; but the night was still, and fortunately some of the  windows were open. Thinking that some evil work was being done, I  rode straight for it, climbed the wall and, making my way on foot  to the house, happily arrived in time.\"    \"You saw the fellows, then? How was it that they suffered you to  escape with your life? They must have known that your evidence  would hang them all.\"    \"There were but six of them, sire; and they will need no hanging,  for they are all disposed of. Though had it not been for the  assistance of a brave servant maid, who threw herself upon the back  of one of them, my career would certainly have been terminated.\"    \"But who had you with you to help you?\" the king asked.    \"I had no one but the maid, sire.\"    \"Do you mean to say, Mr. Drummond, that with your own hand you slew  the whole of the six villains?\"    \"That was so, sire; but in respect to the one thrown down by the  girl, I had but to blow out his brains before he could gain his  feet.\"    \"Can you give us the particulars?\" the king asked quietly. \"If you  do not feel equal to it, we will wait till morning.\"    \"I can tell you now, sire. I am feeling better and stronger.\"    And he related the incidents of the fight.    \"One with his pistol, Keith,\" the king said. \"Four with his sword,  after his left hand was disabled, to say nothing of the sixth.    \"That is not a bad beginning for this aide-de-camp, gentlemen.\"    \"No, indeed, sire. It is a most gallant deed, though it was well  for him that he was able to dispose of the first three before the  others appeared on the scene.\"    \"It was a most gallant action, indeed,\" the king repeated; and a  hearty assent was given by the general officers standing round.    \"I congratulate you on your aide-de-camp, Keith,\" he went on. \"A  man capable of killing, single handed, six of my Pomeranians is a  treasure. Do you see that his commission as lieutenant is given me  tomorrow to sign.    \"No, sit still, young sir. It is I who have to thank you, for so  promptly punishing these marauders, who would have brought disgrace  upon my army; and not you who have to thank me. Now, be off to your  bed.\"    Two of the attendants were called in, and these assisted Fergus,  who was almost too weak to stand, to the apartment that he shared  with Lindsay. Keith himself accompanied them. Lindsay leapt out of  bed as they entered.    \"Don't ask any questions, Lindsay,\" the marshal said. \"Drummond has  performed a very gallant action, and has been wounded and, as you  see, can scarce stand from loss of blood. He will be asleep as soon  as he lies down. You will hear all about it, in the morning.\"    The marshal then returned to his apartment. The king was on the  point of leaving.    \"I have left orders,\" he said, \"that as soon as either of the  surgeons returns, I am to be wakened and informed of the state of  Count Eulenfurst. He is a nobleman of distinction and character;  though, I believe, in no great favour at the court here since he  resigned his seat on the council, because he disapproved of the  resources of the state being wasted in extravagance, instead of  being spent in maintaining the army in proper condition. Should he  die, it will cause an extremely bad impression throughout Saxony.\"    At daybreak the next morning, finding that the surgeons had not  returned, Keith despatched an officer to request them to furnish  him, at once, with a written report of the state of the count. He  returned in three-quarters of an hour, saying that the count had  just recovered consciousness; that two of his wounds were serious,  and the other very grave; but that having probed it, they were of  opinion that it might not prove fatal. The countess was completely  prostrated, and had gone from one fainting fit into another, and  required more attention than her husband. The rest of the household  were uninjured.    Lindsay got up quietly and dressed without awaking Fergus. He was  disappointed at a despatch being at once handed to him to carry to  the Prince of Brunswick's army, which was ten miles away; and was  therefore obliged to mount and ride off, without obtaining any news  whatever as to the nature of Drummond's adventure. As he passed  through the camp of the Pomeranians, he saw the bodies of six  soldiers swinging from the bough of a tree, close to the camp. He  rode a little out of his way to discover the cause of this strange  spectacle. In front of them was erected a large placard of canvas,  with the words painted upon it:    \"Marauders killed in the commission of crime, and their bodies hung  by order of the king, as a lesson to anyone who ventures to break  the law against plundering.\"    Then he rode on his way, and did not return until one o'clock. The  marshal was occupied. He therefore simply handed in the reply to  the despatch that he had carried, and immediately retired.    \"Is Mr. Drummond up?\" he asked one of the attendants.    \"He is still in his room, sir. His servant is with him, and he is  taking food.\"    He went straight to the room. Fergus was sitting up in a chair,  eating a basin of strong chicken broth.    \"This is a nice hour to be breakfasting, Lindsay,\" he said with a  smile. \"I feel quite ashamed of myself, I can tell you; but I am  under orders. The doctor came here half an hour ago. I had just  woke and got out of bed, and was going to dress, when he told me  that I was not to do so. I might sit up to take breakfast, but was  to keep perfectly quiet for the rest of the day. He said I only  needed feeding up, that he would send me some strong broth, and  three hours later I was to have some soup and a pint of Burgundy;  and that if I obeyed his instructions, and ate and drank well, I  should be able to leave my room tomorrow; though of course, I  should not be fit for active service till my arm began to heal.\"    \"But what is it all about, Drummond? I was sent off to Brunswick's  camp, as soon as I got up, and have heard nothing about it; and the  marshal forbade me to speak to you, when you were brought in last  night. He merely said that you had done a very gallant action.\"    \"There was nothing very gallant in it, Lindsay; but it turned out  very fortunate.\"    Then he gave a very brief account of the previous evening's events.    \"Well I should call that a gallant action, Drummond, if you don't.  It is no joke for one man to tackle six, and those not ordinary  marauders but Pomeranian soldiers. Of course, it was somewhat lucky  that you had rid yourself of three of them, before the other three  entered the room; and had it not been, as you say, for that girl,  things might have turned out differently. Still, that does not  affect the matter. It was a gallant business.    \"What happened when you came in?\"    \"I don't know much about what happened. At first I made some sort  of report to the marshal, and then I believe I fainted. When I came  to, I found that they had bandaged up my shoulder, and poured some  wine down my throat. I felt very shaky at first, but I know that I  drank some wine, and was then able to give some sort of account of  what had happened. The king was there, then, and asked me  questions; but whether or not he was there, at first, I cannot say.  I have a vague idea that he told the marshal, too, that he promoted  me; but I am not quite sure about that, nor do I know how I got  here.\"    \"Well, if you are not mistaken about your step, I congratulate you  most heartily. It is seldom, indeed, that anyone gains one in six  weeks after his first appointment. I thought myself lucky, indeed,  in getting it after serving only two years and a half; but I got it  simply on nomination as one of the marshal's aides-de-camp. It is  customary to get promotion, on such appointment, if there has been  two or three years' previous service.    \"Well, you have drawn the first blood in this campaign, Drummond;  and have not been long in giving very striking proof that your  month's hard work in the fencing school has not been thrown away.\"    The conversation was broken off by the entry of the marshal,  himself.    \"Pooh, pooh, Fergus!\" he said, as the latter rose, \"there is no  occasion for saluting in a bedroom. I am glad to see you looking so  much better. You could not have looked more ghastly, when you came  in yesterday evening, if you had been your own wraith.    \"There, lad,\" he said, handing him a parchment. \"It is not usual to  have a new commission on promotion, but the king told me that he  had had it done, in the present case, in order that you might have  a record of the exploit for which you have been promoted. You will  see it is set down inside that, although but six weeks in service,  you were promoted to the rank of lieutenant for a deed of  extraordinary gallantry. You had attacked and killed, with your own  hand, six marauding soldiers; who had entered the chateau of Count  Eulenfurst, well-nigh murdered the count, killed six of his  servants, and were occupied in plundering the house. In token of  his thankfulness, that the life of so distinguished and enlightened  a nobleman had been saved by you; as well as of approbation for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19715"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Norwich (#12)"],[1,"esbytery, looking East.]    #The Chapels.#--In the Norman cathedral, grouped round the east end of  the presbytery, was a trefoil of chapels; the one on the north, the  Jesus Chapel, yet remains, and as well its fellow on the south. The Lady  Chapel, or easternmost of the three (shown on plan by dotted lines) was  succeeded by an Early English building, which, in its turn, was  destroyed; the entrance arches, of beautiful proportion, alone  remaining.    [Illustration: Norman Work in the Lantern of Tower.]    #The Jesus Chapel# formerly belonged to the bishop. On plan its shape is  that of segments of circles joined, the altar placed in the smaller  part. A simple wall arcade runs round the lower half, the whole being  covered by a plain quadri-partite vault. The windows are insertions of  Perpendicular work, varied in character from the Norman work of the  chapel itself. The mural colouring is a restoration; it may be something  like the original, but the general effect is somewhat garish.    [Illustration: The Ante-Reliquary Bridge Chapel.]    The altar consists of a slab of grey Barnack-stone, with Purbeck  inlaid, the whole being supported on shafts.    The tomb of Sir Thomas Wyndham, now in the north of nave, at one time  stood here, as also the pelican lectern now in the choir.    In Britton, the chapel is shown divided off from the aisle by a stone  screen of Perpendicular character; this was removed, and used to form in  part the present screens dividing the ante-choir from the aisles.    A room over the Jesus Chapel, once the plumbery, is now used as a  museum.    The Entrance which led to the Lady Chapel is immediately behind the  apse, and takes the form of a double arch with clustered columns to the  jambs and central pier; the archivolt is deeply moulded and enriched  with the typical Early English \"dog-tooth\" ornament. In the spandrel  over the pier, and between the archivolts, is a quatrefoiled opening  fitting just under the line of the semi-circular Norman vault. The  arches, walled-in up to the impost level, are now filled with glass, as  well as the opening. The original circular Norman Lady Chapel was  destroyed in part by the fire of 1169; it was repaired by Bishop De  Turbe (1146-74), but it was not until the time of Walter de Suffield  (1245-57) that it was decided to pull it down and rebuild a chapel in  the style of the period--viz. Early English; it was this later building  that Dean Gardiner (1573-89) destroyed.    Dean Goulburn, in his work on the cathedral, points out that it was the  _cultus_ of the Blessed Virgin, which gathered strength all over Europe  during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that led to the erection of  such sumptuous chapels as this thirteenth-century Lady Chapel of Norwich  must have been. When the theological reaction followed, they fell into  disuse and neglect, and their final ruin followed when it was found  cheaper to pull them down than keep them in repair.    The beautiful proportion of the entrance arches still remaining, the  archivolt enriched with the \"dog-tooth\" moulding--the only example of  this particular ornament at Norwich--gives one an idea of what the  chapel may have been like. During the recent works of reparation in the  choir, pieces of stone were found with the \"dog-tooth\" built inwards:  evidently the stone from the pulled down chapel had been used by the  masons for the repair of the fabric.    #St. Luke's Chapel#, on the south side of the apse corresponding with  the Jesus Chapel on the north, was formerly the chapel of the prior. It  is now used as the parish church of St. Mary in the Marsh. It has been  much restored, and the Decorated windows shown in Britton's view of the  east end of the cathedral were replaced early in the sixties, by what  the restorer would no doubt have called Norman.    The coloured glass was inserted to the east window in 1868, the south  window in 1870, the west window in 1881. That in the east and south is  by Hardman, in the west by Clayton & Bell. The glass in the south window  forms a memorial to Adam Sedgwick, Professor of Geology at Cambridge,  and canon of the cathedral for many years.    The room over the St. Luke's Chapel is used as the #Treasury and  Muniment Room#.    #The Bauchon Chapel#--corrupted to Beauchamp--dedicated to St.  Mary-the-Less, projects to the south of the third bay of the presbytery  aisle past the tower, (marked B on plan). It was founded in the  fourteenth century and the vault added in the fifteenth century. Its  bosses represent the Life, Death, and Assumption of the Virgin. The  chapel is now used as the consistory court. The bishop's throne, erected  by Dean Lloyd late in the eighteenth century in the choir, has found a  resting-place here.    A chapel, founded by Bishop Wakering, and which is said to have been  used as the chapter-house after the demolition of that structure, came  between the Bauchon Chapel and the east wall of the south transept. Its  exact position is, however, doubtful. Harrod, quoting Blomfield, speaks  of another chapel that was dedicated to St. Osyth, and which was paved  in 1398.    [Illustration: Doorway and Screen between South Transept and Aisle of  Presbytery.]    #The South Transept.#--The screen and doorway filling the Norman arch  between the south aisle of presbytery and the south transept should be  noticed; it is an interesting piece of work of late Perpendicular  design. There is a tradition that the Puritans disliked especially any  tracery that took the form of this piece of screen work, calling windows  in which it occurred \"wicked windows.\" The intersection of the lines of  the tracery made the monogram of the Blessed Virgin; and the fanatics  destroyed such work wherever noticed. The tale is interesting, though we  cannot vouch for its truth.    [Illustration: View across the Apse from the Chapel of St. Luke.]    At the time the whitewash and paint covering the south transept was  cleaned off a range of small arcading was discovered immediately under  the line of the vault, as in the north transept, walled-up evidently  when the vault was added.    The south transept had in Norman times a circular chapel projecting  eastward similar to that remaining to the north transept. This was  replaced by a later sacristy during the fifteenth century, and the line  of this roof can be seen from the outside.    Across the south end there was formerly a stone screen built by Bishop  Lyhart (1446-72) communicating with the vestry on the east side, and on  the west with the staircase to rooms above the east walk of cloisters.  These rooms, as we have before noted, were in all probability the  dormitories of the monks, placed that they might so conveniently gain  access to the cathedral for the services.    On the top of Lyhart's screen came a clock; there are records in the  sacrists' rolls of materials used in the construction of an earlier  clock that was made between 1322-25--of two hundred pieces of Caen stone  and ten of \"Gobetz\" used to make a base, and that for making thirty  images to represent the days of the month, no less than 47s. 4d. was  paid.    The vault was added by Bishop Nykke at the same time as that to the  north transept; the carved bosses representing the early history of  Christ--the Presentation, Baptism, etc. The painted glass window on the  east side, the subject of which is the Ascension (after Raphael), was  erected by the widow of Dean Lloyd about a century since. Speaking of  its original position in the triforium of the presbytery, Britton says  \"it disfigures, rather than ornaments, its station\"; it can safely be  added that it fulfils the same purpose still.    #Monuments.#--Chantrey's statue of Bishop Bathhurst (d. 1837),  originally in the presbytery, has been placed here in the south  transept. The west wall has a memorial to the men and officers of the  9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot who fell in China and Japan.    The east wall has a similar tablet to those of the same regiment who  fell in Afghanistan, 1842. A monument, originally on the west wall, to  Bishop Scambler (1585-95), has been removed to the south aisle of nave.    The county of Norfolk is peculiarly rich in painted screens of the  fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; and it would have been strange  indeed if no specimen of their work had been preserved in the cathedral.  Fortunately, a superb #retable# in five panels, representing scenes in  the Passion of our Lord was discovered by Professor Willis in 1847, and  is now preserved in the aisle outside the Jesus Chapel.    This was formerly an altar-piece to the Jesus Chapel, and was preserved  by the happy accident of its admirable carpentry having saved it for the  purposes of a table. It appears to have been the work of an Italian  artist of about 1370 A.D., and is executed in a kind of _gesso_ work.  The size is now 7 ft. 51/2 ins. x 2 ft. 4 ins.; but it was formerly  surrounded by an ornamented frame, of which portions remain on three  sides. The subjects represented are--from the left--The Scourging,  Bearing the Cross, the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the  Ascension.[1]        [Footnote 1: Royal Arch. Institute: Norwich volume, p. 198.]    Traces of other decorative painting have also been discovered in the  Sacrist's Room, St. Luke's and the Jesus Chapels, the choir aisles, and  other places.
