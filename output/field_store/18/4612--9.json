[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21007"],[0,"The Bird Study Book (#12)"],[1,"rds._--Most people who have made the acquaintance of our  common birds know the friendly little Chickadee, which winter and  summer is a constant resident in groves of deciduous trees.  It feeds,  among other things, on borers living in the bark of trees, on plant  lice which suck the sap, on caterpillars which consume the leaves, and  on codling worms which destroy fruit.  One naturalist found that four  Chickadees had eaten one hundred and five female cankerworm moths.  With scalpel, tweezers, and microscope these moths were examined, {106}  and each was found to contain on an average one hundred and eighty-five  eggs.  This gives a total of nearly twenty thousand cankerworm moth  eggs destroyed by four birds in a few minutes.  The Chickadee is very  fond of the eggs of this moth and hunts them assiduously during the  four weeks of the summer when the moths are laying them.    The Nighthawk, which feeds mainly in the evening, and which is equally  at home in the pine barrens of Florida, the prairies of Dakota, or the  upper air of New York City, is a slaughterer of insects of many kinds.  A Government agent collected one, in the stomach of which were the  remains of thirty-four May beetles, the larvae of which are the white  grubs well known to farmers on account of their destruction of potatoes  and other vegetables.  Several stomachs have been found to contain  fifty or more different kinds of insects, and the number of individuals  in some cases run into the thousands.  Nighthawks also eat  grasshoppers, potato-beetles, cucumber-beetles, boll-weevils,  leaf-hoppers, and numerous gnats and {107} mosquitoes.  Surely this  splendid representative of the Goatsucker family deserves the gratitude  of all American citizens.    Among the branches of certain of our fruit trees we sometimes see large  webs which have been made by the tent caterpillars.  An invading host  seems to have pitched its tents among the boughs on all sides.  If  undisturbed these caterpillars strip the foliage from the trees.  Fortunately there is a bird which is very fond of these hairy  intruders.  This is the Cuckoo, and he eats so many that his stomach  actually becomes lined with a thick coating of hairs from their woolly  bodies.  The Baltimore Oriole also is fond of rifling these webs.    Another well-known bird that helps to make this part of the world  habitable is the Flicker.  It is popular in every neighbourhood where  it is found and is known by a wide variety of local names, over one  hundred and twenty-five of which have been recorded.  Golden-winged  Woodpecker some people call it.  Other names are High-holder, Wake-up,  {108} Walk-up, Yellowhammer, and Pigeon Woodpecker.  The people of Cape  Hatteras know it as Wilkrissen, and in some parts of Florida it is the  Yucker-bird.  Naturalists call it _Colaptes auratus_, but name it as  you may, this bird of many aliases is well worthy of the esteem in  which it is held.  It gathers its food almost entirely from the ground,  being different in this respect from other Woodpeckers.  One may flush  it in the grove, the forest, the peanut field, or the untilled prairie,  and everywhere it is found engaged in the most highly satisfactory  occupation of destroying insect life.  More than half of its food  consists of ants.  In this country, taken as a whole, Flickers are very  numerous, and the millions of individual birds which have yet escaped  the guns of degenerate pot hunters constitute a mighty army of  destruction to the _Formicidae_.    Let us not forget that any creature which eats ants is a decided boon  to humanity.  Ants, besides being wood borers, invaders of pantries,  killers of young birds, nuisances to campers and barefoot {109} boys,  care for and perpetuate plant lice which infest vegetation in all parts  of the country to our very serious loss.  Professor Forbes, in his  study of the corn plant louse, found that in spring ants mine along the  principal roots of the corn.  Then they collect the plant lice, or  aphids, and convey them into these burrows and there watch and protect  them.  Without the assistance of ants, it appears that the plant lice  would be unable to reach the roots of the corn.  In return for these  attentions the ants feast upon the honey-like substances secreted by  these aphids.  The ants, which have the reputation of being no  sluggards, take good care of their diminutive milch cattle, and will  tenderly pick them up and transport them to new pastures when the old  ones fail.  Late in the summer they carefully collect all the aphid  eggs that are obtainable, and taking them into their nests keep them  safe during the winter.  When spring comes and the eggs hatch, the ants  gather the young plant lice and place them on plants.  It may be seen,  therefore, that the Flicker {110} by digging up ants' nests and feeding  on the inhabitants has its value in an agricultural community.    _The Question of the Weed Seeds._--The work of the Chickadee, the  Nighthawk, the Cuckoo, and the Flicker is only an example of the good  being done by at least two-thirds of birds in the United States, and  most of the remainder are not without their beneficial qualities.  When  the coming of winter brings a cessation of insect life, many birds turn  to the weed patches for food.  Especially is this the case with the  various varieties of native Sparrows.    No one has yet determined just how many weed seeds one of these birds  will eat in a day.  The number, however, must be very great.  An  ornithologist, upon examining the stomach of a Tree Sparrow, found it  to contain seven hundred undigested pigeon-weed seeds, and in the same  way it was discovered that a Snow Bunting had taken one thousand seeds  of the pigweed at one meal.    [Illustration: Cuckoo, Raiding a Tent of Caterpillars]    Mr. E. H. Forbush, the well-known Massachusetts naturalist, frequently  amuses himself by {111} observing the birds near his house as they feed  on the millet seed that he provides for them.  Speaking of some of the  things he saw here, he says, \"A Fox Sparrow ate one hundred and three  seeds in two minutes and forty-seven seconds; another, one {112}  hundred and ten in three minutes, forty-five seconds; while still  another Song Sparrow ate one hundred and fifty-four in the same length  of time.  This Sparrow had been eating for half an hour before the  count began and continued for some time after it was finished.\"  It is  readily seen that thirty seeds a minute was below the average of these  birds; and if each bird ate at that rate for but a single hour each day  it would destroy eighteen hundred seeds a day, or twelve thousand six  hundred a week.  Some day the economic ornithologists under the  leadership of Professor F. E. L. Beal, America's leading authority on  the subject, may give us a full and exhaustive account of what the  various birds do for us in the way of keeping down the great scourge of  grass and weeds with which the farmers have to deal.  In the meantime,  however, we may bear in mind that enough evidence already has been  accumulated to prove that as destroyers of noxious weed seeds the wild  birds are of vast importance.    [Illustration: Farallon Cormorants and White Pelicans on a Government  Bird Reservation in southern Oregon.]    _Dealing with the Rodent Pests._--In addition to {113} weeds and  insects, there is yet another group of pests, some representatives of  which may be found in every neighbourhood.  It is composed of rabbits,  ground squirrels, prairie dogs, mice, and the like.  They all possess  long front teeth for gnawing, and constitute the Order of Rodents.  Some species destroy fruit trees by gnawing away the bark near the  ground, others attack the grain stacked in the field or stored in the  granary.  As these little sharp-eyed creatures are chiefly nocturnal in  their habits, we seldom see them; we see only the ruin they have  wrought.  In some of the American ports incoming vessels are  systematically fumigated to kill the rats for fear they may bring with  them the bubonic plague.  In April, 1898, while engaged in field  natural history work in Hyde County, North Carolina, I found the farms  along the north shore of Matamuskeet Lake were overrun by swarms of  large brown rats that burrowed in the ground everywhere, and coming out  at night wrought havoc and destruction on the farm lands.  The whole  country was up {114} in arms and the farmers were appealing for State  and Federal aid to help them rid the land of this terrible scourge.  In  short, the rodents, as a class, are regarded as decidedly detrimental  to the interests of mankind.    [Illustration: Screech Owl and Its Prey]    _The Terror That Flies by Night._--Among the chief enemies of rodents  in North America are the nineteen species of Owls, untold numbers of  which are abroad every night searching through fields and forests for  just such creatures as these.  The digestive processes of Owls are such  that the hard, indigestible portions of their food are disgorged in the  form of balls and may often be found beneath their roosting places.  One of our most odd-looking birds is the Barn Owl.  Being nocturnal in  its habits it is rarely seen unless one takes the trouble to climb into  unfrequented church towers, the attics of abandoned buildings, or  similar places which they seek out for roosting purposes.  Some years  ago the naturalist, Dr. A. K. Fisher, discovered that a pair of Barn  Owls had taken up their abode in one of the towers {115} of the  Smithsonion Institution building.  He found the floor thickly strewn  with pellets composed of bones and fur which these birds and their  young had disgorged.  He collected two hundred of these {116} and took  them to his laboratory.  A painstaking examination showed that they  contained four hundred and fifty-three skulls.  Here is his list made  out at the time: two hundred and twenty-five meadow mice, two pine  mice,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21012"],[0,"The Loyalists of America and Their Times, Vol. 1 of 2. (#12)"],[1,"to the King and fidelity to the Government and to the several  colonies [settlements] therein, be taken of every person that shall live  within or under the same.\" This was as follows: \"You shall be truly  loyal to our Sovereign Lord the King and his heirs and successors: and  whereas you make choice at present to reside within the government of  New Plymouth, you shall not do or cause to be done any act or acts,  directly or indirectly, by land or water, that shall or may tend to the  destruction or overthrow of the whole or any of the several colonies  [settlements] within the said government that are or shall be orderly  erected or established; but shall, contrariwise, hinder, oppose and  discover such intents and purposes as tend thereunto to the Governor for  the time being, or some one of the assistants, with all convenient  speed. You shall also submit unto and obey such good and wholesome laws,  ordinances and officers as are or shall be established within the  several limits thereof. So help you God, who is the God of truth and  punisher of falsehood.\"    The Government of Plymouth prefaced the revised collection of their laws  and ordinances as follows:    \"A form to be placed before the records of the several inheritances  granted to all and every of the King's subjects inhabiting with the  Government of New Plymouth:    \"Whereas John Carver, William Bradford, Edward Winslow, William  Brewster, Isaack Alliston and divers others of the subjects of our late  Sovereign Lord James, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland,  France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c., did in the eighteenth  year of his reigne of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the  fifty-four, which was the year of our Lord God 1620, undertake a voyage  into that part of America called Virginia or New England, thereunto  adjoining, there to erect a plantation and colony of English, intending  the glory of God and the enlargement of his Majesty's dominions, and the  special good of the English nation.\"    Thus the laws and ordinances of the Plymouth Government, and the oaths  of office from the Governor to the constable, freeman and transient  resident, recognize their duty as British subjects, and breathe a spirit  of pure loyalty to their Sovereign. The only reference I find in their  records to the Commonwealth of England is the following declaration,  made in 1658, the last year of Cromwell's government. It is the preface  to the collection of the General Laws, revised and published Sept. 29,  1658, and is as follows:    \"We, the associates of New Plymouth, coming hither as freeborn subjects  of the State of England, endowed with all the privileges belonging to  such, being assembled, do ordain, constitute and enact that no act,  imposition, laws or ordinances be made or imposed on us at present or to  come, but such as shall be made and imposed by consent of the body of  the associates or their representatives legally assembled, which is  according to the free libertie of the State of England.\"    At the first annual meeting of the Plymouth House of Representatives  after the restoration of Charles the Second, the following declaration  and order was made:    \"Whereas we are certainly informed that it hath pleased God to establish  our Sovereign Lord King Charles the Second in the enjoyment of his  undoubted rights to the Crowns of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,  and is so declared and owned by his good subjects of these kingdoms; We  therefore, his Majesty's loyal subjects, the inhabitants of the  jurisdiction of New Plymouth, do hereby declare our free and ready  concurrence with such other of his Majesty's subjects, and to his said  Majesty, his heirs and successors, we do most humbly and faithfully  submit and oblige ourselves for ever. God save the King.    \"June the fifth, Anno Dom. 1661.    \"The fifth day of June, 1661, Charles the Second, King of England,  Scotland, France and Ireland, &c., was solemnly proclaimed at Plymouth,  in New England, in America.\" (This the Puritan Government of  Massachusetts Bay refused to do.)    On the accession of James the Second we find the following entry in the  Plymouth records: \"The twenty fourth of April, 1685, James the Second,  King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, &c., was solemnly  proclaimed at Plymouth according to the form required by his Majesty's  most honourable Privy Council.\"    After the Revolution of 1688 in England, there is the following record  of the proceedings of the Legislature of the Plymouth colony--proceedings  in which testimony is borne by the colonists of the uniformly kind  treatment they had received from the Government of England, except during  a short interval under the three years' reign of James the Second:    \"At their Majesties' General Court of Election, held at Plymouth on the  first Tuesday in June, 1689.    \"Whereas, through the great changes Divine Providence hath ordered out,  both in England and in this country, we the loyal subjects of the Crown  of England are left in an unsettled estate, destitute of government and  exposed to the ill consequences thereof: and _having heretofore enjoyed  a quiet settlement of government in this their Majesties' colony of New  Plymouth for more than threescore and six years, without any  interruptions; having also been by the late kings of England from time  to time, by their royal letters, graciously owned and acknowledged  therein_: whereby, notwithstanding our late unjust interruption and  suspension therefrom by the illegal arbitrary power of Sir Edmond  Andros, now ceased, the General Court held there in the name of their  present Majesties William and Mary, King and Queen of England, &c.,  together with the encouragement given by their said Majesties' gracious  declarations and in humble confidence of their said Majesties' good  liking: do therefore hereby resume and declare their reassuming of their  said former way of government, according to such wholesome  constitutions, rules and orders as were here in force in June, 1686, our  title thereto being warranted by prescription and otherwise as  aforesaid; and expect a ready submission thereunto by all their  Majesties' good subjects of this colony, until their Majesties or this  Court shall otherwise order; and that all our Courts be hereafter held  and all warrants directed and officers sworn in the name of their  Majesties William and Mary, King and Queen of England, &c.    \"The General Court request the Honourable Governor, Thomas Hinckley,  Esq., in behalf of said Court and Colony of New Plymouth, to make their  address to their Majesties the King and Queen of England, &c., for the  re-establishment of their former enjoyed liberties and privileges, both  sacred and civil.\"    We have thus the testimony of the Plymouth colony itself that there was  no attempt on the part of either Charles the First or Second to  interfere with the fullest exercise of their own chosen form of worship,  or with anything which they themselves regarded as their civil rights.  If another course of proceedings had to be adopted in regard to the  Puritan Government of Massachusetts Bay, it was occasioned by their own  conduct, as will appear hereafter. Complaints were made by colonists to  England of the persecuting and unjust conduct of the Puritan Government,  and inquiries were ordered in 1646, 1664, 1678, and afterwards. The  nature and result of these inquiries will be noticed hereafter. At  present I will notice the first Commission sent out by Charles the  Second, in 1664, and which was made general to the several colonies, to  avoid invidious distinction, though caused by complaints against the  conduct of the Puritan Government of Massachusetts Bay. The  Commissioners proposed four questions to the Governments of the several  colonies of New England. I will give the questions, or rather  propositions, and the answers to them on the part of the Pilgrim  Government of Plymouth, as contained in its printed records:--    \"_The Propositions made by His Majesty's Commissioners to the General  Court of (New Plymouth), held at Plymouth, for the jurisdiction of New  Plymouth, the 22nd of February, Anno Dom. 1665._    \"1. That all householders inhabiting in the colony take the oath of  allegiance, and the administration of justice be in his Majesty's name.    \"2. That all men of competent estates and civil conversation, though of  different judgments, may be admitted to be freemen, and have liberty to  choose and to be chosen officers, both civil and military.    \"3. That all men and women of orthodox opinions, competent knowledge and  civil lives (not scandalous), may be admitted to the sacrament of the  Lord's Supper, and their children to baptism if they desire it; either  by admitting them into the congregation already gathered, or permitting  them to gather themselves into such congregations, where they may have  the benefit of the sacraments.    \"4. That all laws and expressions in laws derogatory to his Majesty, if  any such have been made in these late troublesome times, may be  repealed, altered, and taken off from the file.\"      THE COURT'S ANSWER.    \"1. To the first we consent, it _having been the practice of this  Court_, in the first place, _to insert in the oath of fidelity required  of every householder, to be truly loyal to our Sovereign Lord the King,  his heirs and successors. Also to administer all acts of justice in his  Majesty's name_.    \"2. To the second we also consent, _it having been our constant practice  to admit men of competent estates and civil conversation, though of  different judgments, yet being otherwise orthodox, to be freemen, and  to have liberty to choose and be chosen officers, both civil and  military_.    \"3. To the third, we cannot but acknowledge it to be a high favour from  God and from our Sovereign, that we may enjoy our consciences in point  of God's worship, the main end"]]]
