In  the San Francisco market we find wheat, barley, maize, beans, peas,  potatoes, cabbages, beets, salads, pine-apples, chirimoyas, guavas,  oranges, lemons, pears, quinces, peaches, apricots, melons, and  strawberries--the last all the year round. Most of these are exotics;  the early discoverers found not a cereal grain of the Old World, not an  orange or apple, no sugar-cane or strawberries.[27]    [Footnote 27: The vase is still shown in which Father Rixi brought the  first wheat from Europe. It was sown in what is now the San Francisco  Plaza, the chief market-place of the city.]    There is but little manufacturing industry in the interior of Ecuador,  but much more than on the coast. The chief articles manufactured are  straw hats, shoes, baskets, carpets, embroidery, tape, thread, ponchos,  coarse woolen and cotton cloth, saddles, sandals, soap, sugar, cigars,  aguardiente, powder, sweetmeats, carved images, paints, and pottery.  Wines, crockery, glassware, cutlery, silks, and fine cloth are imported.  There are three cotton mills in the country; one in Chillo (established  by Senors Aguirre in 1842), another in Otovalo (built by Senor Parija in  1859), and a third in Cuenca (1861). The machinery of the Chillo factory  came from England; that of Otovalo from Patterson, N.J. The latter was  utterly destroyed in the late great earthquake, and the proprietor  killed. The cotton is inferior to that of New Orleans; it is not \"fat,\"  as mechanics say; the seeds yield only two per cent. of oil. But it is  whiter than American cotton, though coarse, and can be used only for  very ordinary fabrics. The average length is five eighths of an inch.  One pod will produce on an average three pennyweights. The mills of  Chillo and Otovalo consume 425,000 pounds annually. The first sugar-mill  was erected by the Aguirres in 1840 at Nanegal.    [Illustration: Indian Dwellings.]    Quito is more than a century behind this age of steam and lightning. To  form an adequate idea of the mechanic and fine arts in that \"city of the  kings,\" we must transport ourselves to the Saxon period of European  civilization. Both the material and the construction of the houses would  craze Sir Christopher Wren. With fine quarries close at hand, they must  build with mud mixed with stones, or plastered on wattles, like the  Druses of Mount Lebanon. Living on the equatorial line and on the  meridian so accurately measured by the highest mathematics of France and  Spain, Quitonians must needs leave out every right angle or straight  line in the walls, and every square beam and rafter. Except on the grand  road from Quito to Ambato, commenced by President Moreno, there is not a  wheel-barrow to be seen; paving-stones, lime, brick, and dirt, are  usually carried on human backs. Saint Crispin never had the fortitude to  do penance in the shoes of Quito, and the huge nails which enter into  the hoofs of the quadrupedants remind one of the Cyclops. There are not  six carts in Quito. If you wish to move, you must coax a dozen Indians,  who care little for your money or your threats. Horse-hire, peonage, and  most mechanical work must be paid for in advance. Carriages--antique  vehicles, of which there are two or three in the city--are drawn by  mules. The first was introduced by Senor Aguirre so late as 1859, and he  was fined by the police for the privilege of riding in it. Quitonians  are not a traveling people, and they are painfully ignorant of their own  country. The most enterprising merchant ignores every thing but Quito  and the road to Guayaquil.    We can not praise the musical talent of Spanish Americans; their  intonation is too nasal, while in their jumpings and chirpings they take  after the grasshopper. A resident Englishman, who has traveled in many  countries, and sings the songs of nearly every nation, told us he could  not remember one of Ecuador. Pianos they have brought over the mountains  at great expense; but they are more at home with the guitar. The  embroidery and lace, wood carving and portrait painting of Quito, are  commendable; but the grandeur of the Andes, like the beauty of the Alps,  was never sketched by a native.    Ecuador boasts of one University and eleven colleges; yet the people are  not educated. Literature, science, philosophy, law, medicine, are only  names. Nearly all young gentlemen are doctors of something; but their  education is strangely dwarfed, defective, and distorted; and their  knowledge, such as they have, is without power, as it is without  practice. The University of Quito has two hundred and eighty-five  students, of whom thirty-five are pursuing law, and eighteen medicine.  There are eleven professors. They receive no fees from the students, but  an annual salary of $300. The library contains eleven thousand volumes,  nearly all old Latin, Spanish, and French works. The cabinet is a bushel  of stones cast into one corner of a lumber-room, covered with dust, and  crying out in vain for a man in the University to name them. The College  of Tacunga has forty-five students; a fine chemical and philosophical  apparatus, but no one to handle it; and a set of rocks from Europe, but  only a handful from Ecuador. The College of Riobamba has four  professors, and one hundred and twenty students. In the common schools,  the pupils study in concert aloud, Arab fashion. There are four papers  in the republic; two in Guayaquil, one in Cuenca, and one in Quito. _El  Nacional_, of the capital, is an official organ, not a newspaper; it  contains fourteen duodecimo pages, and is published occasionally by the  Minister of the Interior. Like the _Gazeta_ of Madrid, it is one of the  greatest satires ever deliberately published by any people on itself.  There is likewise but one paper in Cuzco, _El Triumfo del Pueblo_.    The amusements of Quito are few, and not very amusing. Indo-Castilian  blood runs too slowly for merry-making. There are no operas or concerts,  no theatres or lectures, no museums or menageries. For dramas they have  revolutions; for menageries, bull-baitings. A bull-bait is not a  bull-fight. There is no coliseum or amphitheatre; no _matador_ gives the  scientific death-wound. Unlike their fraternity in the ring of Seville,  where they are doomed to die, the animals are only doomed to be  pothered; they are \"scotched, not killed.\" They are teased and tormented  by yelling crowds, barking dogs, brass bands, red ponchos, tail-pulling,  fire-crackers, wooden lances, and such like. The Plaza de Toros is the  Plaza de San Francisco. This sport is reserved for the most notable  days in the calendar: Christmas, New Year's, Inauguration-day, and  Independence-day--the 10th of August.    Cock-fights come next in popularity, and are _bona fide_ fights. Often  the roosters are so heroic that both leave their blood in the arena, and  never crow again. Little knives are fastened to the natural spurs, with  which the fowls cut each other up frightfully. The interesting scene  takes place on Sundays and Thursdays, near the Church of Santa Catalina,  and is regulated by a municipal tribunal. The admission fee of five  cents, and the tax of two per cent. on bets, yield the city a monthly  revenue of $100.    Other pastimes are carnivals and masquerades. Carnival is observed by  pelting one another with eggs and sprinkling with water. Whoever  invented this prelude to Lent should be canonized. Masquerades occur  during the holidays, when all classes, in disguise or fancy dress, get  up a little fun at each other's expense. The monotony of social life is  more frequently disturbed by fashionable funerals than by these  amusements; and, as the principal families are inter-related, the rules  of condolence keep the best part of society in mourning, and the best  pianos and guitars silent for at least six months in the year.    A word about the ladies of Quito. We concur in the remark of our  minister, Mr. Hassaurek, that \"their natural dignity, gracefulness, and  politeness, their entire self-possession, their elegant but unaffected  bearing, and the choiceness of their language, would enable them to make  a creditable appearance in any foreign drawing-room.\" Their natural  talents are of a high order; but we must add that the senoras are  uneducated, and are incapable of either great vices or great virtues.  Their minds, like the soil of their native country, are fertile, but  uncultivated; and their hearts, like the climate, are of a mean  temperature. Prayer-books and French novels (imported, as wanted, for  there is not a book-store in the city) are the alpha and the omega of  their literature; Paris is considered the centre of civilization. They  are comely, but not beautiful; Venus has given her girdle of fascination  to few. Sensible of this, they paint.    Holinski gives his impressions by contrasting the fair Quitonians with  the fairer Guayaquilians: \"Les yeux vifs et ardent, le pied fine et  mignon, les teintes chaudes et dorees\" distinguish the latter. In the  ladies of the high capital there is nothing of this: \"Les yeux ne  lancent pas de flammes, le pied est sans gentillesse, l'epiderme ne  reflete pas les rayons du soleil.\" The ladies on the coast take all  possible pains to preserve the small size of the foot; a large foot is  held in horror. Von Tschudi once overheard some ladies extolling in high  terms the beauty of an English lady; all their praise, however, ending  with this exclamation, \"But what a foot! Good heavens! it is like a  great boat!\" Gibbon is continually talking of beautiful senoras and  senoritas on the Andes; surely the lieutenant is in sport.[28]    [Footnote 28: \"The young ladies of Cuzco are, in general, very  beautiful, with regular features, fresh olive"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19211"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part A. (#12)"],[1," in  Redwald's honor and friendship, with his other accomplishments, engaged  the queen on his side; and she effectually represented to her husband  the infamy of delivering up to certain destruction their royal guest,  who had fled to them for protection against his cruel and jealous  enemies.[****] Redwald, embracing more generous resolutions, thought  it safest to prevent Adelfrid, before that prince was aware of his  intention, and to attack him while he was yet unprepared for defence.         [* Brompton, p. 779.]         [** Trivet, apud Spell. Concil. p. 111.]         [*** Bede, lib. ii. cap. 2. W. Malms, lib. i. cap.       3.]         [**** W. Malms, lib. i. cap. 3. H. Hunting, lib.       iii. Bede.]      He marched suddenly with an army into the kingdom of Northumberland, and  fought a battle with Adelfrid; in which that monarch was defeated  and killed, after revenging himself by the death of Regner, son of  Redwald.[*] His own sons, Eanfrid. Oswald, and Oswy, yet infants, were  carried into Scotland; and Edwin obtained possession of the crown of  Northumberland.    Edwin was the greatest prince of the Heptarchy in that age,  and distinguished himself, both by his influence over the other  kingdoms,[**] and by the strict execution of justice in his own  dominions. He reclaimed his subjects from the licentious life to which  they had been accustomed; and it was a common saying, that during his  reign a woman or child might openly carry every where a purse of  gold, without any danger of violence or robbery. There is a remarkable  instance, transmitted to us, of the affection borne him by his servants.  Cuichelme, king of Wessex, was his enemy; but finding himself unable  to maintain open war against so gallant and powerful a prince, he  determined to use treachery against him, and he employed one Eumer for  that criminal purpose, The assassin, having obtained admittance, by  pretending to deliver a message from Cuichelme, drew his dagger, and  rushed upon the king. Lilla, an officer of his army, seeing his master's  danger, and having no other means of defence, interposed with his own  body between the king and Burner's dagger, which was pushed with such  violence, that, after piercing Lilla, it even wounded Edwin; but before  the assassin could renew his blow, he was despatched by the king's  attendants.      The East Angles conspired against Redwald, their king; and having put  him to death, they offered their crown to Edwin, of whose valor and  capacity they had had experience, while he resided among them. But  Edwin, from a sense oL gratitude towards his benefactor, obliged them  to submit to Earpwold, the son of Redwald; and that prince preserved his  authority, though on a precarious footing, under the protection of the  Northumbrian monarch.[***]         [* Bede, lib. ii. cap. 12. Bromton, p. 781.]         [** Chron. Sax. p. 27.]         [*** W. Malms, lib. i. cap. 3]    Edwin, after his accession to the crown, married Ethelburga, the  daughter of Ethelbert, king of Kent. This princess, emulating the glory  of her mother, Bertha, who had been the instrument for converting her  husband and his people to Christianity, carried Paullinus, a learned  bishop, along with her;[*] and besides stipulating a toleration for the  exercise of her own religion, which was readily granted her, she used  every reason to persuade the king to embrace it. Edwin, like a  prudent prince, hesitated on the proposal, but promised to examine  the foundations of that doctrine, and declared that, if he found them  satisfactory, he was willing to be converted.[**] Accordingly he held  several conferences with Paullinus; canvassed the arguments propounded  with the wisest of his counsellors; retired frequently from company, in  order to revolve alone that important question; and, after a serious  and long inquiry, declared in favor of the Christian religion;[***]  the people soon after imitated his example. Besides the authority and  influence of the king, they were moved by another striking example.  Coifi, the high priest, being converted after a public conference with  Paullinus, led the way in destroying the images, which he had so long  worshipped, and was forward in making this atonement for his past  idolatry.[****]    This able prince perished with his son Osfrid, in a great battle which  he fought against Penda, king of Mercia, and Caedwalla, king of the  Britons.[*****] That event, which happened in the forty-eighth year of  Edwin's age and seventeenth of his reign,[******] divided the monarchy  of Northumberland, which that prince had united in his person. Eanfrid,  the son of Adelfrid, returned with his brothers, Oswald and Oswy, from  Scotland, and took possession of Bernicia, his paternal kingdom; Osric,  Edwin's cousin-german, established himself in Deiri, the inheritance  of his family, but to which the sons of Edwin had a preferable title.  Eanfrid, the elder surviving son, fled to Penda, by whom he was  treacherously slain. The younger son, Vuscfraea, with Yffi, the  grandson of Edwin, by Osfrid, sought protection in Kent, and not finding  themselves in safety there, retired into France to King Dagobert, where  they died.[*******]         [* H. Hunting, lib. iii.]         [** Bede, lib. ii. cap. 9.]         [*** Bede, lib. ii. cap. 9. W. Malms, lib. i. cap.       3.]         [**** Bede, lib. ii. cap. 13. Brompton, Higden,       lib. v.]         [***** M. West. p. 114. Chron. Sax. p. 29.]         [****** W. Malms, lib. i. cap. 3.]         [******* Bede, lib. ii, cap. 29.]    Osric, king of Deiri and Eanfrid of Bernicia, returned to paganism; and  the whole people seem to have returned with them; since Paullinus, who  was the first archbishop of York; and who had converted them, thought  proper to retire with Ethelburga, the queen dowager, into Kent. Both  these Northumbrian kings perished soon after, the first in battle  against Caedwalla, the Briton; the second by the treachery of that  prince. Oswald, the brother of Eanfrid, of the race of Bernicia, united  again the kingdom of Northumberland in the year 634, and restored  the Christian religion in his dominions. He gained a bloody and  well-disputed battle against Caedwalla; the last vigorous effort which  the Britons made against the Saxons. Oswald is much celebrated for his  sanctity and charity by the monkish historians; and they pretend that  his relics wrought miracles, particularly the curing of a sick horse,  which had approached the place of his interment.[*]         [* Bede, lib. iii. cap. 9.]    He died in battle against Penda, king of Mercia, and was succeeded by  his brother Oswy, who established himself in the government of the whole  Northumbrian kingdom, by putting to death Oswin, the son of Osric,  the last king of the race of Deiri. His son Egfrid succeeded him; who  perishing in battle against the Picts, without leaving any children,  because Adelthrid, his wife, refused to violate her vow of chastity,  Alfred, his natural brother, acquired possession of the kingdom, which  he governed for nineteen years; and he left it to Osred, his son, a boy  of eight years of age. This prince, after a reign of eleven years, was  murdered by Kenred, his kinsman, who, after enjoying the crown only a  year, perished by a like fate. Osric, and after him Celwulph, the son  of Kenred, next mounted the throne, which the latter relinquished in  the year 738, in favor of Eadbert, his cousin-german, who, imitating  his predecessor, abdicated the crown, and retired into a monastery.  Oswolf, son of Eadbert, was slain in a sedition, a year after his  accession to the crown; and Mollo, who was not of the royal family,  seized the crown. He perished by the treachery of Ailred, a prince of  the blood; and Ailred, having succeeded in his design upon the throne,  was soon after expelled by his subjects. Ethelred, his successor, the  son of Mollo, underwent a like fate. Celwold, the next king, the brother  of Ailred, was deposed and slain by the people; and his place was filled  by Osred, his nephew, who, after a short reign of a year, made way for  Ethelbert, another son of Mollo whose death was equally tragical  with that of almost all his predecessors. After Ethelbert's death, a  universal anarchy prevailed in Northumberland; and the people having, by  so many fatal revolutions, lost all attachment to their government and  princes, were well prepared for subjection to a foreign yoke; which  Egbert, king of Wessex, finally imposed upon them.          THE KINGDOM OF EAST ANGLIA    The history of this kingdom contains nothing memorable except the  conversion of Earpwold, the fourth king, and great-grandson of Una, the  founder of the monarchy. The authority of Edwin, king of Northumberland,  on whom that prince entirety depended, engaged him to take this step;  but soon after, his wife, who was an idolatress, brought him back to her  religion; and he was found unable to resist those allurements which have  seduced the wisest of mankind. After his death, which was violent,  like that of most of the Saxon princes that did not early retire into  monasteries, Sigebert, his successor and half-brother, who had been  educated in France, restored Christianity, and introduced learning  among the East Angles. Some pretend that he founded the university  of Cambridge, or rather some schools in that place. It is almost  impossible, and quite needless, to be more particular in relating the  transactions of the East Angles. What instruction or entertainment can  it give the reader, to hear a long bead-roll of barbarous names,  Egric, Annas, Ethelbert, Ethelwald, Aldulf, Elfwald, Beorne, Ethelred,  Ethelbert, who successively murdered, expelled, or inherited from each  other, and obscurely filled the throne of that kingdom? Ethelbert,  the last of these princes, was treacherously murdered by Offa, king of  Mercia, in the year 792, and his state was thenceforth [*mited] with  that"]]]
