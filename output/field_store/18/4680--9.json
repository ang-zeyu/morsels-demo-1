In the midst of the talk Isaac Ledyard wrote  Hamilton that \"a tide was likely to make strongly for Mr. Burr,\"[56]  and James Watson, in a similar strain, argued that Burr's chances, if  supported by Federalists, would be \"strong.\"[57]    [Footnote 56: James Parton, _Life of Aaron Burr_, Vol. 1, p. 187.]    [Footnote 57: _Ibid._, 188.]    Clinton's firm hold upon his party quickly checked Burr's hope from  that quarter, but the increasing difficulty among Federalists to find  a candidate offered opportunity for Burr's peculiar tactics, until his  adherents were everywhere--on the bench, in the Legislature, in the  drawing-rooms, the coffee-houses, and the streets. Hamilton had only  to present him and say, \"Here is your candidate,\" and Aaron Burr would  cheerfully have opposed the friend who, within less than two years,  had appointed him attorney-general and elected him United States  senator. But Hamilton deliberately snuffed him out. The great  Federalist had finally induced John Jay to become the candidate of his  party. This was on February 13, 1792. Two days later, the  anti-Federalists named George Clinton and Pierre Van Cortlandt, the  old ticket which had done service for fifteen years.    In inducing John Jay to lead his party, Hamilton made a good start.  Heretofore Jay had steadily refused to become a candidate for  governor. \"That the office of the first magistrate of the State,\" he  wrote, May 16, 1777, \"will be more respectable as well as more  lucrative than the place I now fill is very apparent; but my object in  the course of the present great contest neither has been nor will be  either rank or money.\"[58] After his return from Europe, when Governor  Clinton's division of patronage and treatment of royalists had become  intensely objectionable, Jay was again urged to stand as a candidate,  but he answered that \"a servant should not leave a good old master for  the sake of more pay or a prettier livery.\"[59] If this was good  reasoning in 1786 and 1789, when he was secretary of foreign affairs,  it was better reasoning in 1792, when he was chief justice of the  United States; but the pleadings of Hamilton seem to have set a  presidential bee buzzing, or, at least, to have started ambition in a  mind until now without ambition. At any rate, Jay, suddenly and  without any apparent reason, consented to exchange the most exalted  office next to President, to chance the New York governorship.    [Footnote 58: William Jay, _Life of John Jay_, Vol. 1, p. 162.]    [Footnote 59: _Ibid._, p. 198.]    There had never been a time since John Jay entered public life that he  was not the most popular man in the city of New York. In 1788 he  received for delegate to the Poughkeepsie convention, twenty-seven  hundred and thirty-five votes out of a total of twenty-eight hundred  and thirty-three. John Adams called him \"a Roman\" because he resembled  Cato more than any of his contemporaries. Jay's life divided itself  into three distinct epochs of twenty-eight years each--study and the  practice of law, public employment, and retirement. During the years  of uninterrupted public life, he ran the gamut of office-holding. It  is a long catalogue, including delegate to the Continental Congress,  framer of the New York Constitution, chief justice of the New York  Supreme Court, president of the Continental Congress, minister to  Spain, member of the Peace Commission, secretary of foreign affairs,  chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, negotiator of the  Jay treaty, and finally governor of New York. No other American save  John Quincy Adams and John Marshall ever served his country so  continuously in such exalted and responsible place. On his return from  Europe after an absence of five years, Adams said he returned to his  country \"like a bee to its hive, with both legs loaded with merit and  honour.\"[60]    [Footnote 60: To Thos. Barclay, May 24, 1784, _Hist. Mag._, 1869, p.  358.]    Jay accepted the nomination for governor in 1792, on condition that he  be not asked to take part in the campaign. \"I made it a rule,\" he  wrote afterward, \"neither to begin correspondence nor conversation  upon the subject.\"[61] Accordingly, while New York was deeply stirred,  the Chief Justice leisurely rode over his circuit, out of hearing and  out of sight of the political disturbance, apparently indifferent to  the result.    [Footnote 61: William Jay, _Life of John Jay_, Vol. 1, p. 289.]    The real political campaign which is still periodically made in New  York, may be said to have had its beginning in April, 1792. Seldom has  an election been contested with such prodigality of partisan fury. The  rhetoric of abuse was vigorous and unrestrained; the campaign lie  active and ingenious; the arraignment of class against class sedulous  and adroit, and the excitement most violent and memorable. If a weapon  of political warfare failed to be handled with craft and with courage,  its skilful use was unknown.    Indeed, if any one doubts that it was a real time of political  upheaval, he has only to glance at local histories. Federalists and  anti-Federalists were alike convulsed by a movement which was the  offspring of a genuine and irresistible enthusiasm of that strong,  far-reaching kind that makes epochs in the history of politics. The  people having cut loose from royalty, now proposed cutting loose from  silk stockings, knee breeches, powdered hair, pigtails, shoe buckles,  and ruffled shirts--the emblems of nobility. Perhaps they did not then  care for the red plush waistcoats, the yarn stockings, and the  slippers down at the heel, which Jefferson was to carry into the White  House; but in their effort to overthrow the tyranny of the past, they  were beginning to demand broader suffrage and less ceremony, a larger,  freer man, and less caste. To them, therefore, Jay and Clinton  represented the aristocrat and the democrat. Jay, they said, had been  nurtured in the lap of ease, Clinton had worked his way from the most  humble rank; Jay luxuriated in splendid courts, Clinton dwelt in the  home of the lowly son of toil; Jay was the choice of the rich, Clinton  the man of the people; Jay relied upon the support of the President  and the Secretary of the Treasury, Clinton upon the poor villager and  the toiling farmer.    Newspapers charged Jay with saying that \"there ought to be in America  only two sorts of people, one very rich, the other very poor,\"[62] and  to support the misrepresentation, they quoted his favourite maxim that  \"those who own the country ought to govern it,\" pointing to the State  Constitution which he drafted, to prove that only the well-to-do could  vote. The Dutch, largely the slave holders of the State, accused him  of wishing to rob them by the abolition of slavery. Dressed in other  rhetorical clothes, these stories did service again in 1795 and 1798.    [Footnote 62: George Pellew, _Life of John Jay_, p. 275.]    But the assumption of state debts, and Hamilton's financial system,  became the fiercest objects of attack. To them were traced the \"reign  of speculators\" that flowered in the year 1791. \"Bank bubbles,  tontines, lotteries, monopolies, usury, gambling and swindling  abound,\" said the New York _Journal_; \"poverty in the country, luxury  in the capitals, corruption and usurpation in the national councils.\"  Hamilton's system had given the deepest stab to the hopes of the  anti-Federalists, since it taught people to look to the Union rather  than to the State. Internal taxes and import duties were paid to the  United States; coin was minted by the United States; paper money  issued by the United States; letters carried and delivered by the  United States; and state debts assumed by the United States. All this  had a tendency to break state attachments and state importance; and in  striking back, Republican orators branded the reports of the Secretary  of the Treasury as \"dangerous to liberty,\" the assumption of debts as  \"a clever device for enslaving the people,\" and the whole fiscal  system \"a dishonest scheme.\" The failure and imprisonment of William  Duer, until recently Hamilton's trusted assistant, followed by riots  in New York City, gave colour to the charge, and, although the most  bitter opponents of the great Federalist in no wise connected him with  any corrupt transaction, yet in the spring of 1792 Hamilton, the  friend and backer of Jay, was the most roundly abused man in the  campaign.    The Federalists resented misrepresentation with misrepresentation.  Clinton's use of patronage, his opposition to the Federal  Constitution, and the impropriety of having a military governor in  time of peace, objections left over from 1789, still figured as set  pieces in rhetorical fireworks; but the great red light, burned at  every meeting throughout the State, exposed Governor Clinton as  secretly profiting by the sale of public lands. The Legislature of  1791 authorised the five state officers, acting as Commissioners of  the Land Office, to sell unappropriated lands in such parcels and on  such terms as they deemed expedient, and under this power 5,542,173  acres returned $1,030,433. Some of the land brought three shillings  per acre, some two shillings six pence, some one shilling, but  Alexander McComb picked up 3,635,200 acres at eight pence. McComb was  a friend of Clinton. More than that, he was a real estate dealer and  speculator. In the legislative investigation that followed,  resolutions condemning the commissioners' conduct tangled up Clinton  in a division of the profits, and sent McComb to jail. This was a  sweet morsel for the Federalists. It mattered not that the Governor  denied it; that McComb contradicted it; that no proof supported it; or  that the Assembly acquitted him by a party vote of thirty-five to  twenty; the story did effective"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22594"],[0,"Colonial Records of Virginia (#12)"],[1,"]      Sir Francis Wyatt, Gov^r    Margarett, Lady Wyatt,    Hant Wyatt, minister,    Kathren Spencer,    Thomas Hooker,    John Gather,    John Matcheman,    Edward Cooke,    George Nelson,    George Hall,    Lane Burtt,    Elizabeth Powell,    Mary Woodward,    Sir George Yeardley, knight,    Temperance Lady Yeardley,    Argall Yeardley,          284    Frances Yeardley,    Elizabeth Yeardley,    Kilibett Hitchcocke,    Austen Combes,    John Foster,    Richard Arrundell,    Susan Hall,    Ann Grimes,    Elizabeth Lyon,    ---- Younge,      negro }      negro } women,    Alice Davison, _vidua_,    Edward Sharples,    Jone Davies,    George Sands, Treas^r,    Capt.
