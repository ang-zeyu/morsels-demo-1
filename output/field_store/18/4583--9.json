Several allied armies                     also had segregated units, composed, for example,                     of Senegalese, Gurkhas, Maoris, and Algerians.]                       [Footnote 2-17: Memo, ASW for Judge Hastie, 2 Jul 42,                     ASW 291.2, NT 1942.]    Thus very early in World War II, even before the United States was  actively engaged, the issues surrounding the use of Negroes in the  Army were well defined and the lines sharply drawn. Was segregation, a  practice in conflict with the democratic aims of the country, also a  wasteful use of manpower? How would modifications of policy  come--through external pressure or internal reform? Could traditional  organizational and social patterns in the military services be changed  during a war without disrupting combat readiness?      _Segregation and Efficiency_    In the years before World War II, Army planners never had to consider  segregation in terms of manpower efficiency. Conditioned by the  experiences of World War I, when the nation had enjoyed a surplus of  untapped manpower even at the height of the war, and aware of the  overwhelming manpower surplus of the depression years, the staff   (p. 024)  formulated its mobilization plans with little regard for the  economical use of the nation's black manpower. Its decision to use  Negroes in proportion to their percentage of the population was the  result of political pressures rather than military necessity. Black  combat units were considered a luxury that existed to indulge black  demands. When the Army began to mobilize in 1940 it proceeded to honor  its pledge, and one year after Pearl Harbor there were 399,454 Negroes  in the Army, 7.4 percent of the total and 7.95 percent of all enlisted  troops.[2-18]                       [Footnote 2-18: Strength of the Army, 1 Jan 46,                     STM-30, p. 61.]    The effect of segregation on manpower efficiency became apparent only  as the Army tried to translate policy into practice. In the face of  rising black protest and with direct orders from the White House, the  Army had announced that Negroes would be assigned to all arms and  branches in the same ratio as whites. Several forces, however, worked  against this equitable distribution. During the early months of  mobilization the chiefs of those arms and services that had  traditionally been all white accepted less than their share of black  recruits and thus obliged some organizations, the Quartermaster Corps  and the Engineer Corps in particular, to absorb a large percentage of  black inductees. The imbalance worsened in 1941. In December of that  year Negroes accounted for 5 percent of the Infantry and less than 2  percent each of the Air Corps, Medical Corps, and Signal Corps. The  Quartermaster Corps was 15 percent black, the Engineer Corps 25  percent, and unassigned and miscellaneous detachments were 27 percent  black.    The rejection of black units could not always be ascribed to racism  alone. With some justification the arms and services tried to restrict  the number and distribution of Negroes because black units measured  far below their white counterparts in educational achievement and  ability to absorb training, according to the Army General  Classification Test (AGCT). The Army had introduced this test system  in March 1941 as its principal instrument for the measurement of a  soldier's learning ability. Five categories, with the most gifted in  category I, were used in classifying the scores made by the soldiers  taking the test (_Table 1_). The Army planned to take officers and  enlisted specialists from the top three categories and the semiskilled  soldiers and laborers from the two lowest.

Although there was considerable confusion on the subject, basically  the Army's mental tests measured educational achievement rather than  native intelligence, and in 1941 educational achievement in the United  States hinged more on geography and economics than color. Though black  and white recruits of comparable educations made comparable scores,  the majority of Negroes came from areas of the country where inferior  schools combined with economic and cultural poverty to put them at a  significant disadvantage.[2-19] Many whites suffered similar       (p. 025)  disadvantages, and in absolute numbers more whites than blacks appeared  in the lower categories. But whereas the Army could distribute the  low-scoring white soldiers throughout the service so that an  individual unit could easily absorb its few illiterate and  semiliterate white men, the Army was obliged to assign an almost equal  number of low-scoring Negroes to the relatively few black units where  they could neither be absorbed nor easily trained. By the same token,  segregation penalized the educated Negro whose talents were likely to  be wasted when he was assigned to service units along with the  unskilled.                       [Footnote 2-19: Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_,                     pp. 241-57. For an extended discussion of Army test                     scores and their relation to education, see                     Department of the Army, _Marginal Man and Military                     Service: A Review_ (Washington: Government Printing                     Office, 1966). This report was prepared for the                     Deputy Under Secretary of the Army for Personnel                     Management by a working group under the leadership                     of Dr. Samuel King, Office of the Chief of Research                     and Development.]    Segregation further hindered the efficient use of black manpower by  complicating the training of black soldiers. Although training  facilities were at a premium, the Army was forced to provide its  training and replacement centers with separate housing and other  facilities. With an extremely limited number of Regular Army Negroes  to draw from, the service had to create cadres for the new units and  find officers to lead them. Black recruits destined for most arms and  services were assured neither units, billets, nor training cadres. The  Army's solution to the problem: lower the quotas for black inductees.    The use of quotas to regulate inductees by race was itself a source of  tension between the Army and the Bureau of Selective Service.[2-20]  Selective Service questioned the legality of the whole procedure  whereby white and black selectees were delivered on the basis of  separate calls; in many areas of the country draft boards were under  attack for passing over large numbers of Negroes in order to fill  these racial quotas. With the Navy depending exclusively on  volunteers, Selective Service had by early 1943 a backlog of 300,000  black registrants who, according to their order numbers, should have  been called to service but had been passed over. Selective Service  wanted to eliminate the quota system altogether. At the very least it  demanded that the Army accept more Negroes to adjust the racial  imbalance of the draft rolls. The Army, determined to preserve the  quota system, tried to satisfy the Selective Service's minimum  demands, making room for more black inductees by forcing its arms  (p. 026)  and services to create more black units. Again the cost to efficiency  was high.                       [Footnote 2-20: For discussion of how Selective                     Service channeled manpower into the armed forces,                     see Selective Service System, Special Monograph                     Number 10, _Special Groups_ (Washington: Government                     Printing Office, 1953), ch. VIII, and Special                     Monograph Number 12, _Quotas, Calls, and                     Inductions_ (Washington: Government Printing                     Office, 1948), chs. IV-VI.]         Under the pressure of providing sufficient units for Negroes, the       organization of units for the sake of guaranteeing vacancies       became a major goal. In some cases, careful examination of the       usefulness of the types of units provided was subordinated to the       need to create units which could receive Negroes. As a result,       several types of units with limited military value were formed in       some branches for the specific purpose of absorbing otherwise       unwanted Negroes. Conversely, certain types of units with       legitimate and important military functions were filled with       Negroes who could not function efficiently in the tasks to which       they were assigned.[2-21]                       [Footnote 2-21: Lee, _Employment of Negro Troops_, p.                     113.]    [Illustration: ENGINEER CONSTRUCTION TROOPS IN LIBERIA, JULY 1942.]    The practice of creating units for the specific purpose of absorbing  Negroes was particularly evident in the Army Air Forces.[2-22] Long  considered the most recalcitrant of branches in accepting Negroes, (p. 027)  the Air Corps had successfully exempted itself from the allotment of  black troops in the 1940 mobilization plans. Black pilots could not be  used, Maj. Gen. Henry H. Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps, explained,  \"since this would result in having Negro officers serving over white  enlisted men. This would create an impossible social"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2060"],[0,"The History of Caliph Vathek (#12)"],[1," so soothing a  state of indolence, began to twist it round Bababalouk, and tease him  with a thousand vagaries.    When Nouronihar perceived that he was exhausted with fatigue, she  accosted him with an arch air of respectful concern, and said: \"My lord,  it is not by any means decent that the chief eunuch of the Caliph, our  Sovereign, should thus continue standing; deign but to recline your  graceful person upon this sofa, which will burst with vexation if it have  not the honour to receive you.\"    Caught by these flattering accents, Bababalouk gallantly replied:  \"Delight of the apple of my eye!  I accept the invitation of thy honeyed  lips; and, to say truth, my senses are dazzled with the radiance that  beams from thy charms.\"    \"Repose, then, at your ease,\" replied the beauty, and placed him on the  pretended sofa, which, quicker than lightning, gave way all at once.  The  rest of the women, having aptly conceived her design, sprang naked from  the bath, and plied the swing with such unmerciful jerks, that it swept  through the whole compass of a very lofty dome, and took from the poor  victim all power of respiration; sometimes his feet rased the surface of  the water, and at others the skylight almost flattened his nose; in vain  did he pierce the air with the cries of a voice that resembled the  ringing of a cracked basin, for their peals of laughter were still more  predominant.    Nouronihar, in the inebriety of youthful spirits, being used only to  eunuchs of ordinary harems, and having never seen anything so royal and  disgusting, was far more diverted than all of the rest; she began to  parody some Persian verses, and sang with an accent most demurely  piquant:        \"O gentle white dove, as thou soar'st through the air,      Vouchsafe one kind glance on the mate of thy love;      Melodious Philomel, I am thy rose;      Warble some couplet to ravish my heart!\"    The sultanas and their slaves, stimulated by these pleasantries,  persevered at the swing with such unremitted assiduity, that at length  the cord which had secured it snapped suddenly asunder, and Bababalouk  fell floundering like a turtle to the bottom of the bath.  This accident  occasioned a universal shout; twelve little doors, till now unobserved,  flew open at once, and the ladies in an instant made their escape, after  throwing all the towels on his head, and putting out the lights that  remained.    The deplorable animal, in water to the chin, overwhelmed with darkness,  and unable to extricate himself from the wrap that embarrassed him, was  still doomed to hear for his further consolation the fresh bursts of  merriment his disaster occasioned.  He bustled, but in vain, to get from  the bath, for the margin was become so slippery with the oil spilt in  breaking the lamps, that at every effort he slid back with a plunge,  which resounded aloud through the hollow of the dome.  These cursed peals  of laughter at every relapse were redoubled; and he, who thought the  place infested rather by devils than women, resolved to cease groping,  and abide in the bath, where he amused himself with soliloquies,  interspersed with imprecations, of which his malicious neighbours  reclining on down suffered not an accent to escape.  In this delectable  plight the morning surprised him.  The Caliph, wondering at his absence,  had caused him to be everywhere sought for.  At last he was drawn forth,  almost smothered from the wisp of linen, and wet even to the marrow.  Limping and chattering his teeth, he appeared before his master, who  inquired what was the matter, and how he came soused in so strange a  pickle.    \"And why did you enter this cursed lodge?\" answered Bababalouk, gruffly.  \"Ought a monarch like you to visit with his harem the abode of a  grey-bearded Emir, who knows nothing of life?  And with what gracious  damsels doth the place, too, abound!  Fancy to yourself how they have  soaked me like a burnt crust, and made me dance like a jack-pudding the  live-long night through, on their damnable swing!  What an excellent  lesson for your sultanas to follow, into whom I have instilled such  reserve and decorum!\"    Vathek, comprehending not a syllable of all this invective, obliged him  to relate minutely the transaction; but instead of sympathising with the  miserable sufferer, he laughed immoderately at the device of the swing,  and the figure of Bababalouk mounting upon it.  The stung eunuch could  scarcely preserve the semblance of respect.    \"Ay, laugh, my lord! laugh,\" said he; \"but I wish this Nouronihar would  play some trick on you; she is too wicked to spare even majesty itself.\"    Those words made for the present but a slight impression on the Caliph;  but they not long after recurred to his mind.    This conversation was cut short by Fakreddin, who came to request that  Vathek would join in the prayers and ablutions to be solemnised on a  spacious meadow, watered by innumerable streams.  The Caliph found the  waters refreshing, but the prayers abominably irksome; he diverted  himself, however, with the multitude of Calenders, Santons, and Dervises,  who were continually coming and going, but especially with the Brahmins,  Fakirs, and other enthusiasts, who had travelled from the heart of India,  and halted on their way with the Emir.  These latter had, each of them,  some mummery peculiar to himself.  One dragged a huge chain wherever he  went, another an ouranoutang, whilst a third was furnished with scourges,  and all performed to a charm; some clambered up trees, holding one foot  in the air; others poised themselves over a fire, and without mercy  filliped their noses.  There were some amongst them that cherished  vermin, which were not ungrateful in requiting their caresses.  These  rambling fanatics revolted the hearts of the Dervises, the Calenders, and  Santons; however, the vehemence of their aversion soon subsided, under  the hope that the presence of the Caliph would cure their folly, and  convert them to the Mussulman faith; but, alas! how great was their  disappointment! for Vathek, instead of preaching to them, treated them as  buffoons, bade them present his compliments to Visnow and Ixhora, and  discovered a predilection for a squat old man from the isle of Serendib,  who was more ridiculous than any of the rest.    \"Come!\" said he, \"for the love of your gods bestow a few slaps on your  chops to amuse me.\"    The old fellow, offended at such an address, began loudly to weep; but,  as he betrayed a villainous drivelling in his tears, the Caliph turned  his back and listened to Bababalouk, who whispered, whilst he held the  umbrella over him: \"Your Majesty should be cautious of this odd assembly  which hath been collected I know not for what.  Is it necessary to  exhibit such spectacles to a mighty potentate, with interludes of  Talapoins more mangy than dogs?  Were I you, I would command a fire to be  kindled, and at once purge the earth of the Emir, his harem, and all his  menagerie.\"    \"Tush, dolt!\" answered Vathek; \"and know that all this infinitely charms  me; nor shall I leave the meadow till I have visited every hive of these  pious mendicants.\"    Wherever the Caliph directed his course objects of pity were sure to  swarm round him: the blind, the purblind, smarts without noses, damsels  without ears, each to extol the munificence of Fakreddin, who, as well as  his attendant grey-beards, dealt about gratis plasters and cataplasms to  all that applied.  At noon a superb corps of cripples made its  appearance, and soon after advanced by platoons on the plain, the  completest association of invalids that had ever been embodied till then.  The blind went groping with the blind, the lame limped on together, and  the maimed made gestures to each other with the only arm that remained;  the sides of a considerable waterfall were crowded by the deaf, amongst  whom were some from Pegu with ears uncommonly handsome and large, but  were still less able to hear than the rest; nor were there wanting others  in abundance with humpbacks, wenny necks, and even horns of an exquisite  polish.    The Emir, to aggrandise the solemnity of the festival in honour of his  illustrious visitant, ordered the turf to be spread on all sides with  skins and table-cloths, upon which were served up for the good Mussulmans  pilaus of every line, with other orthodox dishes; and, by the express  order of Vathek, who was shamefully tolerant, small plates of  abominations for regaling the rest.  This prince, on seeing so many  mouths put in motion, began to think it time for employing his own; in  spite, therefore, of every remonstrance from the chief of his eunuchs, he  resolved to have a dinner dressed on the spot.  The complaisant Emir  immediately gave orders for a table to be placed in the shade of the  willows.  The first service consisted of fish, which they drew from a  river flowing over sands of gold at the foot of a lofty hill; these were  broiled as fast as taken, and served up with a sauce of vinegar, and  small herbs that grow on Mount Sinai; for everything with the Emir was  excellent and pious.    The dessert was not quite set on when the sound of lutes from the hill  was repeated by the echoes of the neighbouring mountains.  The Caliph,  with an emotion of pleasure and surprise, had no sooner raised up his  head than a handful of jasmine dropped on his face; an abundance of  tittering succeeded the frolic, and instantly appeared through the bushes  the elegant forms of several young females, skipping and bounding like  roes.  The fragrance diffused from their hair struck the sense of Vathek,  who, in an ecstasy, suspending his repast, said to Bababalouk:    \"Are the Peris come down from their spheres?  Note her in particular  whose form is so perfect, venturously running on the brink of the  precipice, and turning back her head, as regardless of nothing but the  graceful flow of her robe; with what captivating"]]]
