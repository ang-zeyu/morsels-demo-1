They occupied a single  temporary shelter of brushwood, within a few paces of which I had a rude  shelter erected for my own accommodation. The patient was a middleaged  woman, who apparently suffered from no ailment whatever; she was stout,  ruddy, cheerful, and did her full share of the household work every day;  yet she was about to give away for these ceremonies sheep, horses, and  other goods to the value of perhaps two hundred dollars. No ceremonies  whatever were in progress when I came. Everything, so the Indians said,  was waiting for the qaÃ§Ã li. (Paragraph 2.) Some men were engaged in  building a corral for the sheep that were to be slaughtered for the  guests, and some old women were grinding corn to feast the men who were  to work in the medicine lodge, which had been completed six days before.    83. This lodge was a simple conical structure of large, partly hewed  piÃ±on logs, set on end and inclined at an angle of about forty-five  degrees, so as to join one another on top, where they formed the apex of  the lodge. The circle of logs was incomplete in the east, where the  openings for the door and the smoke hole were. A passage, or entry,  about five feet high and three feet wide, led from the body of the lodge  to the outer doorway, where some blankets hung as portiÃ¨res. The frame  of logs was covered with sods and loose earth to keep out wind and rain.  Internally, the lodge was eight feet in height under the apex of the  cone and on an average twenty-five feet in diameter at the base. The  diameter was increased at the east (to allow for the entry) and at the  north. The irregularity in the circumference in the north was at first  conjectured to be a mere accident; but in the ceremonies of the first  night its use became apparent as affording a hiding place for the man  dressed in evergreens. (Paragraph 96.)      [Illustration:    Bureau of Ethnology    Fifth Annual Report Pl. X    MEDICINE LODGE, VIEWED FROM THE SOUTH.]      84. THE FIRST FOUR DAYS' ceremonies in this case had been performed  during the previous year. Such a division of the work is sometimes made,  if more convenient for the patient and his friends, but usually all is  done in nine consecutive days. These first days have less of interest  than the others. Early each morning, before eating, all who desire, men  and women, enter the medicine lodge, where, in a stifling atmosphere,  seated around a fire of dry wood of four different kinds--cedar, big  willow, little willow, and spruce--they take the hot emetic infusion of  fifteen different kinds of plants mixed together. A little sand is  placed in front of each to receive the ejected material. After the  emetic has acted the fire is removed, deposited some paces to the north  of the lodge, and allowed to die out. Each devotee's pile of sand is  then removed (beginning with that of the man who sat in the east and  going round the circle) and deposited, one after another, in a line  north of the sacred fire. Each succeeding day's deposits are placed  farther and farther north in a continuous line. Next all return to the  lodge, which has been allowed to cool; the shaman spits on each some  medicine which has been mixed with hoar-frost and is supposed to cool.  When all have left the lodge, a new fire of ordinary wood is kindled,  and the kethÃ wns, or sacrificial sticks, appropriate to the day are  made.      85. FIFTH DAY. The chanter did not arrive until the afternoon of October  23. His ceremonies in the medicine lodge began on the morning of the  24th. The forenoon was devoted to the preparation and sacrifice of  certain kethÃ wns (keÃ§Ã n)--the sacrificial sticks, to the origin of which  so much of the foregoing myth is devoted--and of sacrificial cigarettes.  About eight o'clock the sick woman entered the medicine lodge, followed  by the chanter. While she sat on the ground, with her limbs extended, he  applied some powdered substance from his medicine bag to the soles of  her feet, to her knees, breasts, shoulders, cheeks, and head, in the  order named, and then threw some of it towards the heavens through the  smoke hole. Before applying it to the head he placed some of it in her  mouth to be swallowed. Then, kneeling on a sheep skin, with her face to  the east, and holding the bag of medicine in her hand, she recited a  prayer, bit by bit, after the chanter. The prayer being finished, she  arose, put some of the medicine into her mouth, some on her head, and  took her seat in the south, while the shaman went on with the  preparation of the sacrifices.    86. An assistant daubed a nice straight branch of cherry with some  moistened herbaceous powder, after which he divided the branch into four  pieces with a flint knife. Two of the pieces were each about two inches  long and two each about four inches long. In each of the shorter ones he  made one slight gash and in each of the longer ones two gashes. The  sticks were then painted, a shred of yucca leaf being used for the  brush, with rings of black, red, and white, disposed in a different  order on each stick. The two cigarettes were made by filling sections of  some hollow stem with a mixture of some pulverized plants. Such  cigarettes are intended, as the prayers indicate, to be smoked by the  gods. (Paragraph 88.)    87. While the assistants were painting the sticks and making the  cigarettes the old chanter placed on a sheep skin, spread on the floor  woolly side down, other things pertaining to the sacrifice: five bundles  of assorted feathers, five small pieces of cotton sheeting to wrap the  sacrifices in, and two round flat stones, each about four inches in  diameter. The upper surfaces of these he painted, one blue and one  black, and he bordered each with a stripe of red. When the kethÃ wns and  cigarettes were ready, the qaÃ§Ã li distributed them along with the  bunches of plumes, on the five pieces of cotton cloth, which were then  rolled up around their contents, making five bundles of sacrifices. On  the completion of this work there was prayer, song, and rattling; the  medicinal powder was applied to the body of the patient as before  (paragraph 85); two of the little sacrificial bundles were placed in her  right hand, and while she held them she again repeated a prayer,  following again phrase by phrase, or sentence by sentence, the words of  the priest. The latter, when the prayer was ended, took the sacrifices  from her hand and pressed them to different parts of her body in the  order previously observed, beginning with the soles of the feet and  going upwards to the head, but on this occasion touching also the back,  and touching it last. Each time after pressing the sacrifices to her  body he held them up to the smoke hole and blew on them in that  direction a quick puff, as if blowing away some evil influence which the  sacrifices were supposed to draw from her body. Then the three remaining  bundles were put in her hands and the rites observed with the former  bundles were repeated in every respect, including the prayer, which was  followed by singing and rattling. When the song had ceased some of the  assistants took the bundles of sacrifices out of the lodge, no doubt to  bury them according to the method proper for those particular kethÃ wns.  The round painted stones were also carried out.    88. The prayers which the woman repeated varied but little. They all  sounded nearly alike. The night the shaman arrived he rehearsed some of  these prayers with the woman, at her own hogÃ¡n, to make her familiar  with them before she repeated them, in the medicine lodge. The prayer  addressed to Dsilyi` NeyÃ¡ni, when she held in her hand the offering  sacred to him, was as follows:      Reared Within the Mountains!    Lord of the Mountains!    Young Man!    Chieftain!    I have made your sacrifice.    I have prepared a smoke for you.    My feet restore thou for me.    My legs restore thou for me.    My body restore thou for me.    My mind restore thou for me.    My voice restore thou for me.    Restore all for me in beauty.    Make beautiful all that is before me.    Make beautiful all that is behind me.    Make beautiful my words.    It is done in beauty.    It is done in beauty.    It is done in beauty.    It is done in beauty. (Paragraphs 261-4.)      [Illustration:    Bureau of Ethnology    Fifth Annual Report Pl. XI    MEDICINE LODGE, VIEWED FROM THE EAST.]    89. The next part of the ceremonies (or, shall I say, the treatment?)  was a fumigation. The medicine man took from the fire a large glowing  coal, placed it beside the woman, and scattered on it some powdered  substance which instantly gave forth a dense smoke and a strong  fragrance that filled the lodge. The woman held her face over the coal  and inhaled the fumes with deep inspirations. When the smoke no longer  rose the coal was quenched with water and carried out of the lodge by  the chief, Manuelito, probably to be disposed of in some established  manner. Then the woman left the lodge and singing and rattling were  resumed.    90. While the rites just described were in progress some assistants were  busy with other matters. One made, from the spotted skin of a fawn, two  bags in which the akÃ¡ninilis or couriers were to carry their meal on the  morrow's journey. Another brought in and hung over the doorway a bundle  of dry, withered plants which he had just gathered. Glancing up at them  I recognized the _Gutierrezia_ and the _Bouteloua_. The bundle may have  contained the other plants mentioned in the myth (paragraph 44). They  were hung up there till the next day, to be then used in a manner which  will be described (paragraph 101).    91. The sheepskin on which the sacrifices had been placed was taken away  and a blanket was spread on the ground to receive some more sacred  articles from the bag of the chanter.

Better leave that decision to Nye; he  knew the country and the situation. \"You ask about the cart, Callie, but  don't make it definite. Have to see how things turn out.\"    Drew started for the Four Jacks to meet Nye. Back here in Tubacca he was  conscious how much he had allowed his personal affairs to drift from day  to day. Of course he had seen very little of Hunt Rennie at the  Stronghold; his father had ridden south on patrol with his own private  posse shortly after his own arrival there. But whenever Drew thought  seriously of the future he had that odd sense of dislocation and loss  which he had first known on the night he had seen _Don_ Cazar arrive at  the cantina. _Don_ Cazar--Hunt Rennie. Drew Kirby--Drew Rennie. A seesaw to  make a man dizzy, or maybe the vertigo he felt was the product of too much  sun, dust, and riding.    There was someone at a far table in the cantina, but otherwise the dusky  room was empty. Drew went directly to the bar. \"Got any coffee, Fowler?\"    \"Sure thing. Nye was in here 'bout five minutes ago. Said for you to wait  here for him. You hear 'bout Kitchell holdin' up th' stage?\"    \"Callie told me. Said the army patrol went out after him.\"    \"Yeah, don't mean they'll nail him though. He's as good as an Apache 'bout  keepin' undercover. Here's your coffee. Want some grub, too?\"    The smell of coffee revived Drew's hunger. \"Sure could use some. Haven't  eaten since we broke camp at sunup.\"    \"Sing's in th' kitchen. I'll give him th' sign to rattle th' pans.  Say--been racin' that Shiloh of yours lately? Sure am glad I played a hunch  an' backed him against Oro.\" Fowler's red forelock bobbed over his high  forehead as he nodded vigorously.    \"No racin' on the Range.\"    \"Hope you're keepin' him closer. That border crew'd sure like to git a  rope on him! Down Sonora way one of them Mexes would dig right down to th'  bottom of his money chest to buy a hoss like that. I'll go an' tell Sing.\"    Drew, coffee mug in hand, sat down at a table where some of the breeze  beat in the door now and then. Lord, he was really tired. He stretched out  his legs, and the sun made twinkly points of light on the rowels of the  Mexican spurs. Sipping the coffee, he allowed himself the luxury of not  doing any thinking at all.    Fowler brought a heaping plate and Drew began to eat.    \"Oh, there you are!\" Nye slammed in, swung one of the chairs about, and  sat on it back to front, his arms folded across the back.    \"You ridin' out to tell the army we're here--with the horses?\" Drew asked.    \"Nope, caught sight of them ridin' in. Looked like Sergeant Muller was in  command--he'll come in here. Hey, Fowler, how's about another plate of  fodder?\"    \"Steady on, fella. Make it straight ahead now!\"    Both of them looked up. A burly man wearing sergeant's stripes steered a  slighter figure before him through the open door. Johnny Shannon, a  bandage about his uncovered head, lurched as if trying to free himself  from the other's grip and caught at a chair back. Nye and Drew jumped up  to ease him into a seat.    \"What's--?\" began Nye.    Muller interrupted. \"Found him crawlin' along right near town. Says as how  he was took by Kitchell 'n' got away, but he ain't too clear 'bout what  happened or where. Wearin' a crease 'longside his skull; maybe that  scrambled up his thinkin' some.\"    \"Better get Doc Matthews. I think he's in town.\" Fowler came from the bar,  a glass in hand.    \"Right. I'll go.\" Nye started out.    Johnny had slumped forward, his head on the table encircled by his limp  arms. Drew was puzzled. Shannon was supposed to have ridden south on the  Range, not north. What was he doing this far away from the water-hole  route? Had he found a trail which led him in this direction? Or had he  been jumped somewhere by Kitchell's pack of wolves and forced along for  some purpose of their own?    \"Was he ridin', Sergeant?\" Drew asked, hardly knowing why.    \"No--footin' it. Said somethin' about Long Canyon after we gave him a pull  at a canteen. Sure came a long way if that's where he started.\"    \"I'll go get Hamilcar. He knows somethin' 'bout doctorin',\" Fowler cut in.  \"Maybe Doc Matthews ain't here, after all.\"    \"Hey, Sarge, can I see you a minute?\" came a hail from without.    \"You manage.\" Muller made it more order than request as he left.    Drew sat alone with Shannon, one hand on the boy's shoulder to steady him.  He was aware of movement behind him. If the fellow at the back table had  been dozing earlier, he was roused now.    \"Where did you git them spurs?\"    Drew turned, his lips shaped a name, tried again, and got it out as a  hoarse whisper. \"Anse! Don't you know me, Anse?\"    He saw eyes lift from the floor level, the scarred cheek under a ragged  fringe of beard; and then astonishment in the other's expression became a  flashing grin.    \"Drew--Drew Rennie! Lordy, it's sure enough Drew Rennie!\"    Drew was on his feet. His hands on the other's shoulders pulled him  forward into a rough half embrace. \"Anse!\" He swayed to the joyous  pounding of a fist between his shoulder blades. \"I thought you were dead!\"  he somehow gasped.    \"An' I seen _you_ go down; a slug got you plumb center!\" the Texan  sputtered. \"Rolled 'round a bush an' saw you git it! But for a ghost  you're sure lively!\"    \"Caught me in the belt buckle,\" Drew recounted that miracle of the war.  \"Knocked me out; didn't really touch to matter, though.\"    Anse pushed away a little, still holding Drew tightly by the upper arms.  \"Anybody told me I'd see Drew Rennie live an' kickin', I'd said straight  to his face he was a fork-tongued liar!\"    Drew came partly to his senses and the present. Fowler ... Nye ... either  one of them could come back on this reunion. \"Anse--listen! This is  important. I ain't Drew Rennie--not here, not now--\"    \"Had to draw a new name outta th' deck?\" Anse's grin faded; his eyes  narrowed. \"All right, what's the goin' handle?\"    \"Kirby, Drew Kirby ... I'll explain later.\" He had given the warning only  just in time. Fowler and Hamilcar were coming from the back room of the  cantina, and there was a stir at the table.    Johnny was sitting up, his head swaying from side to side, his eyes on  Drew and Anse. But the stare was unfocused; he must still be only half  conscious. Drew had a fleeting prick of worry. Had Shannon heard anything  he would remember? There was nothing to be done about that now.            7      \" ... and that's the way it is.\" Drew sat on the stool which was the only  other furnishing in the bath cubicle while Anse splashed and wallowed in  the slab tub.    The Texan swiped soap from his cheek. \"An' ain't you gonna tell?\"    \"I don't know. Would you?\"    \"Go with m' hat in hand an' say, 'Well, Pa, here's your wanderin' boy'?  No, I dunno as how I'd be makin' that kinda play neither. Never was one to  unspool th' bedroll till I was sure o' th' brand I was ridin' for. An' you  an' me's kinda hide-matched there. Glad you wised me up in time.\"    \"Maybe I didn't,\" Drew admitted.    \"You mean that Shannon? I know you think he's filin' his teeth for you,  but I'd say he was too busy countin' stars from that skull beltin' to make  sense out of our hurrawin'. I'll give him th' eye though. Lissen now,  you're Kirby--so am I called for a rebrandin', too? Seems like two Kirbys  turnin' up in a town this size is gonna make a few people ask some  questions.\"    \"You're my cousin--Anson Kirby.\" Drew had already thought that out. \"Now,  you've some tall talkin' to do your ownself. I saw you roll out of your  saddle back in Tennessee. How come you turn up here and now?\"    Anse sluiced water over his head and shoulders with cupped hands.    \"Do I tell it jus' like it happened, you'll think I'm callin' up mountains  outta prairie-dog hills, it's that crazy. But it's range truth. Yeah, I  landed outta that saddle on some mighty hard ground. If you'll remember, I  had me a hole in the shoulder big enough to let th' wind whistle through.  I rolled between th' bushes jus' in time to see you get it--plumb center  an' final, so I thought. Then ... well, I don't remember too good for a  while. Next time I was able to take a real interest I was lyin' on a bed  with about a mountain of quilts on top me, weaker'n a yearlin' what's jus'  been dragged outta a bog hole. Seems like them Yankees gathered me up with  th' rest of them bushwacker scrubs, but when they got me a mile or so down  th' road they decided as how I'd had it good an' there was no use wastin'  wagon room on me. So they let me lie....    \"Only,\" the Texan paused and then continued more soberly, \"Drew,  sometimes--sometimes it seems like a hombre can have a mite more'n his  share of luck; or else he's got him Someone as is line ridin' for him. We  had us friends in Tennessee, an' it jus' happened as how I was dropped  where one of them families found me. They sure was good folks; patched me  up an' saw me through like I was their close kin. Hid me out by sayin' as  how I had th' cholera.    \"An' most of th' time I didn't know a rope from a saddle--outta my head  complete. First there was that shoulder hole; then I got me a good case of  lung fever. It was two months 'fore I could crawl round better'n a sick  calf what lost its ma too early. Then, jus' as I got so I could stamp m'  boots on th' ground an' expect to stand straight up in 'em, this here  Yankee patrol came 'long an' dogged me right into a bunch o' our boys they  had rounded up. I had me some weeks in a prison stockade, which ain't, I'm  tellin' you, no way for to spend any livin' time. Then this here war was  over, an' I was loose. No hoss, no nothin'. Some of th' boys got to  talkin' 'bout trailin' back to Texas, tryin' out some ranchin' in the bush  country. A lotta wild stuff down there--nobody's been runnin' brands on  anythin' much since '61. We planned to get a herd of mavericks,"]]]
