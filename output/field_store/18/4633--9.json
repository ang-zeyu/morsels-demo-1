At length, a taste for literature  spread through the body of the people; vanity induced the inexperienced  and the ignorant to aspire to literary honours. To oppose these forcible  entries into the haunts of the Muses, periodical criticism brandished  its formidable weapon; and the fall of many, taught some of our greatest  geniuses to rise. Multifarious writings produced multifarious  strictures; and public criticism reached to such perfection, that taste  was generally diffused, enlightening those whose occupations had  otherwise never permitted them to judge of literary compositions.    The invention of REVIEWS, in the form which they have at length  gradually assumed, could not have existed but in the most polished ages  of literature: for without a constant supply of authors, and a refined  spirit of criticism, they could not excite a perpetual interest among  the lovers of literature. These publications were long the chronicles of  taste and science, presenting the existing state of the public mind,  while they formed a ready resource for those idle hours, which men of  letters would not pass idly.    Their multiplicity has undoubtedly produced much evil; puerile critics  and venal drudges manufacture reviews; hence that shameful discordance  of opinion, which is the scorn and scandal of criticism. Passions  hostile to the peaceful truths of literature have likewise made  tremendous inroads in the republic, and every literary virtue has been  lost! In \"Calamities of Authors\" I have given the history of a literary  conspiracy, conducted by a solitary critic, GILBERT STUART, against the  historian HENRY.    These works may disgust by vapid panegyric, or gross invective; weary  by uniform dulness, or tantalise by superficial knowledge. Sometimes  merely written to catch the public attention, a malignity is indulged  against authors, to season the caustic leaves. A reviewer has admired  those works in private, which he has condemned in his official capacity.  But good sense, good temper, and good taste, will ever form an estimable  journalist, who will inspire confidence, and give stability to his  decisions.    To the lovers of literature these volumes, when they have outlived their  year, are not unimportant. They constitute a great portion of literary  history, and are indeed the annals of the republic.    To our own reviews, we must add the old foreign journals, which are  perhaps even more valuable to the man of letters. Of these the variety  is considerable; and many of their writers are now known. They delight  our curiosity by opening new views, and light up in observing minds many  projects of works, wanted in our own literature. GIBBON feasted on them;  and while he turned them over with constant pleasure, derived accurate  notions of works, which no student could himself have verified; of many  works a notion is sufficient.    The origin of literary journals was the happy project of DENIS DE SALLO,  a counsellor in the parliament of Paris. In 1665 appeared his _Journal  des Scavans_. He published his essay in the name of the Sieur de  Hedouville, his footman! Was this a mere stroke of humour, or designed  to insinuate that the freedom of criticism could only be allowed to his  lacquey? The work, however, met with so favourable a reception, that  SALLO had the satisfaction of seeing it, the following year, imitated  throughout Europe, and his Journal, at the same time, translated into  various languages. But as most authors lay themselves open to an acute  critic, the animadversions of SALLO were given with such asperity of  criticism, and such malignity of wit, that this new journal excited loud  murmurs, and the most heart-moving complaints. The learned had their  plagiarisms detected, and the wit had his claims disputed. Sarasin  called the gazettes of this new Aristarchus, Hebdomadary Flams!  _Billevesees hebdomadaires!_ and Menage having published a law book,  which Sallo had treated with severe raillery, he entered into a long  argument to prove, according to Justinian, that a lawyer is not allowed  to defame another lawyer, &c.: _Senatori maledicere non licet,  remaledicere jus fasque est_. Others loudly declaimed against this new  species of imperial tyranny, and this attempt to regulate the public  opinion by that of an individual. Sallo, after having published only his  third volume, felt the irritated wasps of literature thronging so thick  about him, that he very gladly abdicated the throne of criticism. The  journal is said to have suffered a short interruption by a remonstrance  from the nuncio of the pope, for the energy with which Sallo had  defended the liberties of the Gallican church.    Intimidated by the fate of SALLO, his successor, the Abbe GALLOIS,  flourished in a milder reign. He contented himself with giving the  titles of books, accompanied with extracts; and he was more useful than  interesting. The public, who had been so much amused by the raillery and  severity of the founder of this dynasty of new critics, now murmured at  the want of that salt and acidity by which they had relished the  fugitive collation. They were not satisfied with having the most  beautiful, or the most curious parts of a new work brought together;  they wished for the unreasonable entertainment of railing and raillery.  At length another objection was conjured up against the review;  mathematicians complained that they were neglected to make room for  experiments in natural philosophy; the historian sickened over works of  natural history; the antiquaries would have nothing but discoveries of  MSS. or fragments of antiquity. Medical works were called for by one  party, and reprobated by another. In a word, each reader wished only to  have accounts of books, which were interesting to his profession or his  taste. But a review is a work presented to the public at large, and  written for more than one country. In spite of all these difficulties,  this work was carried to a vast extent. An _index_ to the _Journal des  Scavans_ has been arranged on a critical plan, occupying ten volumes in  quarto, which may be considered as a most useful instrument to obtain  the science and literature of the entire century.    The next celebrated reviewer is BAYLE, who undertook, in 1684, his  _Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres_. He possessed the art, acquired  by habit, of reading a book by his fingers, as it has been happily  expressed; and of comprising, in concise extracts, a just notion of a  book, without the addition of irrelevant matter. Lively, neat, and full  of that attic salt which gives a relish to the driest disquisitions,  for the first time the ladies and all the _beau-monde_ took an interest  in the labours of the critic. He wreathed the rod of criticism with  roses. Yet even BAYLE, who declared himself to be a reporter, and not a  judge, BAYLE, the discreet sceptic, could not long satisfy his readers.  His panegyric was thought somewhat prodigal; his fluency of style  somewhat too familiar; and others affected not to relish his gaiety. In  his latter volumes, to still the clamour, he assumed the cold sobriety  of an historian: and has bequeathed no mean legacy to the literary  world, in thirty-six small volumes of criticism, closed in 1687. These  were continued by Bernard, with inferior skill; and by Basnage more  successfully, in his _Histoire des Ouvrages des Scavans_.    The contemporary and the antagonist of BAYLE was LE CLERC. His firm  industry has produced three _Bibliotheques_--_Universelle et  Historique_, _Choisie_, and _Ancienne et Moderne_; forming in all  eighty-two volumes, which, complete, bear a high price. Inferior to  BAYLE in the more pleasing talents, he is perhaps superior in erudition,  and shows great skill in analysis: but his hand drops no flowers! GIBBON  resorted to Le Clerc's volumes at his leisure, \"as an inexhaustible  source of amusement and instruction.\" Apostolo Zeno's _Giornale del  Litterati d'Italia_, from 1710 to 1733, is valuable.    BEAUSOBRE and L'ENFANT, two learned Protestants, wrote a _Bibliotheque  Germanique_, from 1720 to 1740, in 50 volumes. Our own literature is  interested by the \"_Bibliotheque Britannique_,\" written by some literary  Frenchmen, noticed by La Croze, in his \"Voyage Litteraire,\" who  designates the writers in this most tantalising manner: \"Les auteurs  sont gens de merite, et qui entendent tous parfaitement l'Anglois;  Messrs. S.B., le M.D., et le savant Mr. D.\" Posterity has been partially  let into the secret: De Missy was one of the contributors, and Warburton  communicated his project of an edition of Velleius Patereulus. This  useful account of English books begins in 1733, and closes in 1747,  Hague, 23 vols.: to this we must add the _Journal Britannique_, in 18  vols., by Dr. MATY, a foreign physician residing in London; this Journal  exhibits a view of the state of English literature from 1750 to 1755.  GIBBON bestows a high character on the journalist, who sometimes  \"aspires to the character of a poet and a philosopher; one of the last  disciples of the school of Fontenelle.\"    MATY'S son produced here a review known to the curious, his style and  decisions often discover haste and heat, with some striking  observations: alluding to his father, in his motto, Maty applies  Virgil's description of the young Ascanius, \"Sequitur _patrem_ non  passibus aequis.\" He says he only holds a _monthly conversation_ with the  public. His obstinate resolution of carrying on this review without an  associate, has shown its folly and its danger; for a fatal illness  produced a cessation, at once, of his periodical labours and his life.    Other reviews, are the _Memoires de Trevoux_, written by the Jesuits.  Their caustic censure and vivacity of style made "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],[0,"Anarchism and Other Essays (#12)"],[1,"up of some petty offender,  the marriage exposition of an heiress, or the acrobatic stunts of an  ex-president.  The more hideous the mental contortions, the greater  the delight and bravos of the mass.  Thus, poor in ideals and vulgar  of soul, Roosevelt continues to be the man of the hour.    On the other hand, men towering high above such political pygmies,  men of refinement, of culture, of ability, are jeered into silence as  mollycoddles.  It is absurd to claim that ours is the era of  individualism.  Ours is merely a more poignant repetition of the  phenomenon of all history: every effort for progress, for  enlightenment, for science, for religious, political, and economic  liberty, emanates from the minority, and not from the mass.  Today,  as ever, the few are misunderstood, hounded, imprisoned, tortured,  and killed.    The principle of brotherhood expounded by the agitator of Nazareth  preserved the germ of life, of truth and justice, so long as it was  the beacon light of the few.  The moment the majority seized upon it,  that great principle became a shibboleth and harbinger of blood and  fire, spreading suffering and disaster.  The attack on the  omnipotence of Rome was like a sunrise amid the darkness of the  night, only so long as it was made by the colossal figures of a Huss,  a Calvin, or a Luther.  Yet when the mass joined in the procession  against the Catholic monster, it was no less cruel, no less  bloodthirsty than its enemy.  Woe to the heretics, to the minority,  who would not bow to its dicta.  After infinite zeal, endurance, and  sacrifice, the human mind is at last free from the religious phantom;  the minority has gone on in pursuit of new conquests, and the  majority is lagging behind, handicapped by truth grown false with  age.    Politically the human race would still be in the most absolute  slavery, were it not for the John Balls, the Wat Tylers, the Tells,  the innumerable individual giants who fought inch by inch against the  power of kings and tyrants.  But for individual pioneers the world  would have never been shaken to its very roots by that tremendous  wave, the French Revolution.  Great events are usually preceded by  apparently small things.  Thus the eloquence and fire of Camille  Desmoulins was like the trumpet before Jericho, razing to the ground  that emblem of torture, of abuse, of horror, the Bastille.    Always, at every period, the few were the banner bearers of a great  idea, of liberating effort.  Not so the mass, the leaden weight of  which does not let it move.  The truth of this is borne out in Russia  with greater force than elsewhere.  Thousands of lives have already  been consumed by that bloody regime, yet the monster on the throne is  not appeased.  How is such a thing possible when ideas, culture,  literature, when the deepest and finest emotions groan under the iron  yoke?  The majority, that compact, immobile, drowsy mass, the Russian  peasant, after a century of struggle, of sacrifice, of untold misery,  still believes that the rope which strangles \"the man with the white  hands\"[1] brings luck.    In the American struggle for liberty, the majority was no less of a  stumbling block.  Until this very day the ideas of Jefferson, of  Patrick Henry, of Thomas Paine, are denied and sold by their  posterity.  The mass wants none of them.  The greatness and courage  worshipped in Lincoln have been forgotten in the men who created the  background for the panorama of that time.  The true patron saints of  the black men were represented in that handful of fighters in Boston,  Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, and  Theodore Parker, whose great courage and sturdiness culminated in  that somber giant, John Brown.  Their untiring zeal, their eloquence  and perseverance undermined the stronghold of the Southern lords.  Lincoln and his minions followed only when abolition had become a  practical issue, recognized as such by all.    About fifty years ago, a meteor-like idea made its appearance on the  social horizon of the world, an idea so far-reaching, so  revolutionary, so all-embracing as to spread terror in the hearts of  tyrants everywhere.  On the other hand, that idea was a harbinger of  joy, of cheer, of hope to the millions.  The pioneers knew the  difficulties in their way, they knew the opposition, the persecution,  the hardships that would meet them, but proud and unafraid they  started on their march onward, ever onward.  Now that idea has become  a popular slogan.  Almost everyone is a Socialist today: the rich  man, as well as his poor victim; the upholders of law and authority,  as well as their unfortunate culprits; the freethinker, as well as  the perpetuator of religious falsehoods; the fashionable lady, as  well as the shirtwaist girl.  Why not?  Now that the truth of fifty  years ago has become a lie, now that it has been clipped of all its  youthful imagination, and been robbed of its vigor, its strength, its  revolutionary ideal--why not? Now that it is no longer a beautiful  vision, but a \"practical, workable scheme,\" resting on the will of  the majority, why not?  With the same political cunning and  shrewdness the mass is petted, pampered, cheated daily.  Its praise  is being sung in many keys: the poor majority, the outraged, the  abused, the giant majority, if only it would follow us.    Who has not heard this litany before?  Who does not know this  never-varying refrain of all politicians?  That the mass bleeds, that  it is being robbed and exploited, I know as well as our vote-baiters.  But I insist that not the handful of parasites, but the mass itself  is responsible for this horrible state of affairs.  It clings to its  masters, loves the whip, and is the first to cry Crucify! the moment  a protesting voice is raised against the sacredness of capitalistic  authority or any other decayed institution.  Yet how long would  authority and private property exist, if not for the willingness of  the mass to become soldiers, policemen, jailers, and hangmen.  The  Socialist demagogues know that as well as I, but they maintain the  myth of the virtues of the majority, because their very scheme of  life means the perpetuation of power.  And how could the latter be  acquired without numbers?  Yes, power, authority, coercion, and  dependence rest on the mass, but never freedom, never the free  unfoldment of the individual, never the birth of a free society.    Not because I do not feel with the oppressed, the disinherited of the  earth; not because I do not know the shame, the horror, the indignity  of the lives the people lead, do I repudiate the majority as a  creative force for good.  Oh, no, no!  But because I know so well  that as a compact mass it has never stood for justice or equality.  It has suppressed the human voice, subdued the human spirit, chained  the human body.  As a mass its aim has always been to make life  uniform, gray, and monotonous as the desert.  As a mass it will  always be the annihilator of individuality, of free initiative, of  originality.  I therefore believe with Emerson that \"the masses are  crude, lame, pernicious in their demands and influence, and need not  to be flattered, but to be schooled.  I wish not to concede anything  to them, but to drill, divide, and break them up, and draw  individuals out of them.  Masses!  The calamity are the masses.  I do  not wish any mass at all, but honest men only, lovely, sweet,  accomplished women only.\"    In other words, the living, vital truth of social and economic  well-being will become a reality only through the zeal, courage, the  non-compromising determination of intelligent minorities, and not  through the mass.      [1] The intellectuals.        THE PSYCHOLOGY OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE      To analyze the psychology of political violence is not only extremely  difficult, but also very dangerous.  If such acts are treated with  understanding, one is immediately accused of eulogizing them.  If, on  the other hand, human sympathy is expressed with the ATTENTATER,[1] one  risks being considered a possible accomplice.  Yet it is only  intelligence and sympathy that can bring us closer to the source of  human suffering, and teach us the ultimate way out of it.    The primitive man, ignorant of natural forces, dreaded their  approach, hiding from the perils they threatened.  As man learned to  understand Nature's phenomena, he realized that though these may  destroy life and cause great loss, they also bring relief.  To the  earnest student it must be apparent that the accumulated forces in  our social and economic life, culminating in a political act of  violence, are similar to the terrors of the atmosphere, manifested in  storm and lightning.    To thoroughly appreciate the truth of this view, one must feel  intensely the indignity of our social wrongs; one's very being must  throb with the pain, the sorrow, the despair millions of people are  daily made to endure.  Indeed, unless we have become a part of  humanity, we cannot even faintly understand the just indignation that  accumulates in a human soul, the burning, surging passion that makes  the storm inevitable.    The ignorant mass looks upon the man who makes a violent protest  against our social and economic iniquities as upon a wild beast, a  cruel, heartless monster, whose joy it is to destroy life and bathe  in blood; or at best, as upon an irresponsible lunatic.  Yet nothing  is further from the truth.  As a matter of fact, those who have  studied the character and personality of these men, or who have come  in close contact with them, are agreed that it is their  super-sensitiveness to the wrong and injustice surrounding them which  compels them to pay the toll of our social crimes.  The most noted  writers and poets, discussing the psychology of political offenders,  have paid them the highest tribute.  Could anyone assume that these  men had advised violence, or even"]]]
