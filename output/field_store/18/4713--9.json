[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],[0,"The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#12)"],[1," are  many such in the history of early settlement in America.  To say that  cougars are cowardly now when found in the United States--to say they  are shy of man, and will not attack him, may be true enough.  Strange,  if the experience of 200 years' hunting, and by such hunters too, did  not bring them to that.  We may safely believe, that if the lions of  Africa were placed in the same circumstances, a very similar shyness and  dread of the upright biped would soon exhibit itself.  What all these  creatures--bears, cougars, lynxes, wolves, and even alligators--are now,  is no criterion of their past.  Authentic history proves that their  courage, at least so far as regards man, has changed altogether since  they first heard the sharp detonation of the deadly rifle.  Even  contemporaneous history demonstrates this.  In many parts of South  America, both jaguar and cougar attack man, and numerous are the deadly  encounters there.  In Peru, on the eastern declivity of the Andes, large  settlements and even villages have been abandoned solely on account of  the perilous proximity of those fierce animals.    In the United States, the cougar is hunted by dog and gun.  He will run  from the hounds, because he knows they are backed by the unerring rifle  of the hunter; but should one of the yelping pack approach too near, a  single blow of the cougar's paw is sufficient to stretch him out.  When  closely pushed, the cougar takes to a tree, and, halting in one of its  forks, humps his back, bristles his hair, looks downward with gleaming  eyes, and utters a sound somewhat like the purring of a cat, though far  louder.  The crack of the hunter's rifle usually puts an end to these  demonstrations, and the cougar drops to the ground either dead or  wounded.  If only the latter, a desperate fight ensues between him and  the dogs, with several of whom he usually leaves a mark that  distinguishes them for the rest of their lives.    The scream of the cougar is a common phrase.  It is not very certain  that the creature is addicted to the habit of screaming, although noises  of this kind heard in the nocturnal forest have been attributed to him.  Hunters, however, have certainly never heard him, and they believe that  the scream talked about proceeds from one of the numerous species of  owls that inhabit the deep forests of America.  At short intervals, the  cougar does make himself heard in a note which somewhat resembles a  deep-drawn sigh, or as if one were to utter with an extremely guttural  expression the syllables \"Co-oa,\" or \"Cougar.\"  Is it from this that he  derives his trivial name?        CHAPTER EIGHT.    OLD IKE'S ADVENTURE.    Now a panther story was the natural winding-up of this day, and it had  been already hinted that old Ike had \"rubbed out\" several of these  creatures in his time, and no doubt could tell more than one \"painter\"  story.    \"Wal, strengers,\" began he, \"it's true thet this hyur ain't the fust  painter I've comed acrosst.  About fifteen yeern ago I moved to  Loozyanny, an' thur I met a painter, an' a queer story it are.\"    \"Let us have it by all means,\" said several of the party, drawing closer  up and seating themselves to listen attentively.  We all knew that a  story from Ike could not be otherwise than \"queer,\" and our curiosity  was on the _qui vive_.    \"Wal then,\" continued he, \"they have floods dowd thur in Loozyanny, sich  as, I guess, you've never seen the like o' in England.\"  Here Ike  addressed himself specially to our English comrade.  \"England ain't big  enough to hev sich floods.  One o' 'm ud kiver yur hul country, I hev  heern said.  I won't say that ar's true, as I ain't acquainted with yur  jography.  I know, howsomdever, they're mighty big freshets thur, as I  hev sailed a skift more 'n a hundred mile acrosst one o' 'm, whur thur  wan't nothin' to be seen but cypress tops peep in out o' the water.  The  floods, as ye know, come every year, but them ar big ones only oncest in  a while.    \"Wal, as I've said about fifeteen yeern ago, I located in the Red River  bottom, about fifty mile or tharabout below Nacketosh, whur I built me a  shanty.  I hed left my wife an' two young critters in Massissippi state,  intendin' to go back for 'em in the spring; so, ye see, I wur all alone  by meself, exceptin' my ole mar, a Collins's axe, an' of coorse my  rifle.    \"I hed finished the shanty all but the chinkin' an' the buildin' o' a  chimbly, when what shed come on but one o' 'm tarnation floods.  It wur  at night when it begun to make its appearance.  I wur asleep on the  floor o' the shanty, an' the first warnin' I hed o' it wur the feel o'  the water soakin' through my ole blanket.  I hed been a-dreamin', an'  thort it wur rainin', an' then agin I thort that I wur bein' drownded in  the Massissippi; but I wan't many seconds awake, till I guessed what it  wur in raality; so I jumped to my feet like a started buck, an' groped  my way to the door.    \"A sight that wur when I got thur.  I hed chirred a piece o' ground  around the shanty--a kupple o' acres or better--I hed left the stumps a  good three feet high: thur wan't a stump to be seen.  My clearin',  stumps an' all, wur under water; an' I could see it shinin' among the  trees all round the shanty.    \"Of coorse, my fust thoughts wur about my rifle; an I turned back into  the shanty, an' laid my claws upon that quick enough.    \"I next went in search o' my ole mar.  She wan't hard to find; for if  ever a critter made a noise, she did.  She wur tied to a tree close by  the shanty, an' the way she wur a-squealin' wur a caution to cats.  I  found her up to the belly in water, pitchin' an' flounderin' all round  the tree.  She hed nothin' on but the rope that she wur hitched by.  Both saddle an' bridle hed been washed away: so I made the rope into a  sort o' halter, an' mounted her bare-backed.    \"Jest then I begun to think whur I wur agoin'.  The hul country appeared  to be under water: an' the nearest neighbour I hed lived acrosst the  parairy ten miles off.  I knew that his shanty sot on high ground, but  how wur I to get thur?  It wur night; I mout lose my way, an' ride chuck  into the river.    \"When I thort o' ibis, I concluded it mout be better to stay by my own  shanty till mornin'.  I could hitch the mar inside to keep her from  bein' floated away; an' for meself, I could climb on the roof.    \"While I wur thinkin' on this, I noticed that the water wur a-deepenin',  an' it jest kim into my head, that it ud soon be deep enough to drownd  my ole mar.  For meself I wan't frightened.  I mout a clomb a tree, an'  stayed thur till the flood fell; but I shed a lost the mar, an' that  critter wur too valleyble to think o' such a sacryfize; so I made up my  mind to chance crossin' the parairy.  Thur wan't no time to be wasted--  ne'er a minnit; so I gin the mar a kick or two in the ribs an' started.    \"I found the path out to the edge of the parairy easy enough.  I hed  blazed it when I fust come to the place; an', as the night wur not a  very dark one, I could see the blazes as I passed atween the trees.  My  mar knew the track as well as meself, an' swaltered through at a sharp  rate, for she knew too thur wan't no time to be wasted.  In five  minnites we kim out on the edge o' the pairairy, an' jest as I expected,  the hul thing wur kivered with water, an' lookin' like a big pond, I  could see it shinin' clur acrosst to the other side o' the openin'.    \"As luck ud hev it, I could jest git a glimp o' the trees on the fur  side o' the parairy.  Thur wur a big clump o' cypress, that I could see  plain enough; I knew this wur clost to my neighbour's shanty; so I gin  my critter the switch, an' struck right for it.    \"As I left the timmer, the mar wur up to her hips.  Of coorse, I  expected a good grist o' heavy wadin'; but I hed no idee that the water  wur a-gwine to git much higher; thur's whur I made my mistake.    \"I hedn't got more'n a kupple o' miles out when I diskivered that the  thing wur a-risin' rapidly, for I seed the mar wur a-gettin' deeper an'  deeper.    \"'Twan't no use turnin' back now.  I ud lose the mar to a dead sartinty,  if I didn't make the high ground; so I spoke to the critter to do her  best, an' kep on.  The poor beast didn't need any whippin'--she knew as  well's I did meself thur wur danger, an' she wur a-doin' her darndest,  an' no mistake.  Still the water riz, an' kep a-risin', until it come  clur up to her shoulder.    \"I begun to git skeart in airnest.  We wan't more 'n half acrosst, an' I  seed if it riz much more we ud hav to swim for it.  I wan't far astray  about that.  The minnit arter it seemed to deepen suddintly, as if thur  wur a hollow in the parairy: I heerd the mar give a loud gouf, an' then  go down, till I wur up to the waist.  She riz agin the next minnit, but  I could tell from the smooth ridin' that she wur off o' the bottom.  She  wur swimmin', an' no mistake.    \"At fust I thort o' headin' her back to the shanty; an' I drew her round  with that intent; but turn her which way I would, I found she could no  longer touch bottom.    \"I guess, strengers, I wur in a quandairy about then.  I 'gun to think  that both my own an' my mar's time wur come in airnest, for I hed no  idee that the critter could iver swim to the other side, 'specially with  me on her back, an' purticklarly as at that time these hyur ribs had a  sight more griskin upon 'em than they hev now.    \"Wal, I wur about reckinin' up.  I hed got to thinkin' o' Mary an' the  childer, and the old shanty in the Mississippi, an' a heap o' things  that I hed left unsettled, an' that now come into my mind to trouble me.  The mar wur still plungin' ahead; but I seed she wur sinkin' deeper an'  deeper an' fast loosin' her strength, an' I knew she couldn't hold out  much longer.    \"I thort at this time that if I got off o' her back, an' tuk hold o' the  tail, she mout manage a leetle hotter.  So I slipped backwards over her "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23519"],[0,"The Mormon Menace: The Confessions of John Doyle Lee, Danite (#12)"],[1,"so long as he threw his  adversary.    The style of wrestling varied with the desires of the parties.  The Eastern men, or Yankees, used square hold, or collar and  elbow; those from the Middle States side hold, and the Southern  and Western men used breeches hold and old Indian hug or back  hold. If a man was hurt he stood it without a murmur; it was  considered cowardly and childish to whine when thrown or hurt in  the fall.    While the sport was at its height Sidney Rigdon, the mouthpiece  of the Prophet, rushed into the ring, sword in hand, and said  that he would not suffer a lot of men to break the Sabbath day in  that manner. For a moment all were silent. Then one of the  brethren, with more presence of mind than the others, said to the  Prophet:    \"Brother Joseph, we want you to clear us from blame, for we  formed the ring by your request. You told us to wrestle, and now  Brother Rigdon is bringing us to account for it.\"    The Prophet walked into the ring and said, as he made a motion  with his hand:    \"Brother Sidney, you had better get out of here and let the boys  alone; they are amusing themselves according to my orders. You  are an old man. You go and get ready for meeting and let the boys  alone.\" Just then catching Rigdon off his guard, as quick as a  flash he knocked the sword from Rigdon's hand, then caught him by  the shoulder, and said: \"Now, old man, you must go out, or I will  throw you down.\"    Rigdon was as large a man as the Prophet, but not so tall. The  prospect of a tussle between the Prophet and the mouthpiece of  the Prophet was fun for all but Rigdon, who pulled back like a  crawfish; but the resistance was useless, the Prophet dragged him  from the ring, bareheaded, and tore Rigdon's fine pulpit coat  from the collar to the waist; then he turned to the men and said:    \"Go in, boys, and have your fun. You shall never have it to say  that I got you into any trouble that I did not get you out of.\"    Rigdon complained about the loss of his hat and the tearing of  his coat. The Prophet said to him:    \"You were out of your place. Always keep your place and you will  not suffer: but you got a little out of your place and you have  suffered for it. You have no one to blame but yourself.\"    After that Rigdon never countermanded the orders of the Prophet,  to my knowledge; he knew who was boss.    An order had been issued by the Church authorities commanding all  the members of the Mormon Church to leave their farms and take  such property as they could remove and go to one of the two  fortified camps - that is Far West or Adam-on-Diamond. A large  majority of the settlers obeyed, and the two camps were soon full  of people who had deserted home again for the sake of the gospel.    There was a settlement on Log Creek, between three and five miles  east from Far West. It was quite a rich settlement. A man named  Haughn had just completed a good flouring mill on the creek. The  morning after the battle of Crooked River Haughn came to Far West  to consult with the Prophet concerning the policy of the removal  of the settlers on Log Creek to the fortified camps.    Col. White and myself were standing by when the Prophet said to  him:    \"Move in, by all means, if you wish to save your lives.\"    Haughn replied that if the settlers left their homes all of their  property would be lost, and the Gentiles would burn their houses  and other buildings. The Prophet said:    \"You had much better lose your property than your lives; one can  be replaced, the other cannot be restored; but there is no need  of your losing either if you will only do as you are commanded.\"    Haughn said that he considered the best plan was for all of the  settlers to move into and around the mill, and use the blacksmith's  shop and other buildings as a fort in case of attack; in this way  he thought they would be perfectly safe.    \"You are at liberty to do so if you think best,\" said the  Prophet.    Haughn then departed, well satisfied that he had carried his  point. The Prophet turned to Col. White and said:    \"That man did not come for counsel, but to induce me to tell him  to do as he pleased; which I did. Had I commanded them to move in  and leave their property they would have called me a tyrant. I  wish they were here for their own safety. I am confident that we  will soon learn that they have been butchered in a fearful  manner.\"    At this time the Missourians had determined to exterminate the  whole of the Mormon people. Governor Lilburn W. Boggs issued  orders to that effect. I think Gen. Clark was the officer in  command of all the Gentile forces. Gen. Atchison and Col.  Doniphan each commanded a division of from three to four thousand  men, and they soon besieged Far West. The Mormons fortified the  town as well as they could, and took special care to fortify and  build shields and breastworks, to prevent the cavalry from  charging into the town. The Gentile forces were mostly camped on  Log Creek, between Far West and Haughn's Mill, about a mile from  Far West, and about half a mile south of our outer breastworks.    Our scouts and pickets guards were driven in and forced to join  the main ranks for safety. The Mormon troops were placed in  position by the officers, so as to guard every point. We all had  a large supply of bullets, with the patching sewed on the balls  to facilitate the loading of our guns, which were muzzle loaders.  The Mormon force was about eight hundred strong, poorly armed;  many of the men had no guns; some had single-barrel pistols and a  few homemade swords. These were our implements of war.    So situated, we were still anxious to meet the enemy, and  demanded to be led out against our foes. Our men were confident  that God was going to deliver the enemy into our hands, and so we  had no fears. I was one of the advance force, and as I lay behind  some timber, with my cap-box open, and bullets lying on the  ground by my side, I never had a doubt of being able to defeat  the Gentile army.    The troops lay and watched each other several days, then the  Gentiles made two efforts to force their way into the town by  stratagem; but seeing our forces in order they did not come  within range of our guns. The Mormons stood in the ranks, and  prayed for the chance of getting a shot; but all to no effect.  The same evening we learned of the massacre at Haughn's Mill. The  description of this massacre was such as to freeze the blood of  each Saint, and force us to swear that revenge should come some  day.    The massacre was reported about as follows to us at Far West.  When the Gentile mob attacked the Mormons at the mill the Mormons  took shelter in the blacksmith shop and other buildings. The mob  took advantage of the banks of the creek and the timber, and very  nearly surrounded the shop, which was built of logs, and served  as a slaughterhouse instead of a shelter or protection.    The mob, while protected as they were, shot down the Mormons at  their leisure. They killed eighteen and wounded as many more; in  fact, they killed and wounded everyone who did not run away  during the fight and take refuge in the woods. After shooting  down all that could be seen, the mob entered the blacksmith shop  and there found a young lad who had secreted himself under the  bellows. One of the men said:    \"Don't shoot; it is but a small boy.\"    \"It is best to hive them when we can,\" was the reply.    Thus saying, they shot the little fellow.    There was an old man in the settlement by the name of McBride,  who had been a soldier in the Revolutionary War; he was killed by  being hacked to pieces with a corncutter while begging for his  life. The dead and wounded were thrown into a well together.  Several of the wounded were afterwards taken out of the well by  the force that went from Far West, and recovered from their  wounds. So great was the hatred of the mob that they saved none,  but killed all who fell into their hands at that time. I received  my information of the massacre from David Lewis, Tarleton Lewis,  William Laney, and Isaac Laney; they were Kentuckians, and were  also in the fight, but escaped death.    Isaac Laney was shot seven times, the seven shots leaving  thirteen ball holes in his person; five of the shots were nearly  in the center of the chest; one entered under the right arm,  passed through the body and came out under the left arm; yet,  strange as it appears, he kept his feet, and ran some three  hundred yards to a cabin, where a woman raised a loose plank of  the cabin floor and he lay down while she replaced the boards.    The mob left, and in about two hours Laney was taken from under  the cabin floor nearly lifeless. He was then washed, anointed  with oil, the elders praying for his recovery, according to the  order of the Holy Priesthood, and he was promised, through prayer  and faith in God, speedy restoration. The pain at once left him,  and for two weeks he felt no pain at all. He then took cold, and  the wound in his hips pained him for some two hours, when the  elders repeated their prayers and again anointed him, which had  the effect desired. The pain left him, and never returned. I  heard Laney declare this to be a fact, and he bore his testimony  in the presence of many of the Saints. I saw him four weeks after  the massacre and examined his person. I saw the wounds, then  healed. I felt of them with my own hands, and I saw the shirt and  examined it, that he had on when he was shot, and it was cut in  shreds. Many balls had cut his clothing that had not touched his  person.    The massacre at Haughn's Mill was the result of the brethren's  refusal to obey the wishes of the Prophet. All the brethren so  considered it. It made a deep and lasting impression on my mind,  for I had heard the Prophet give the counsel to the brethren to  come into the town. They had refused, and the result was a lesson  to all that there was no safety except in"]]]
