I asked her how she knew me from Rupert, and  she said that one of us had a small mole on the shoulder. I knew that  Rupert had a tiny mole there, and she said that that was the mark by  which she knew your son from hers.    \"Then, father, she told me that she had done it all on purpose, and had  sacrificed herself in order that I might benefit from it. This was all  horrible! And then she actually proposed that I should not only keep  silent about this, but offered to come forward and declare that it was  her son who had the mole on his shoulder, so that I might get the whole  and Rupert none. I don't want to say what I felt. I only told her I  would think it over. I have been thinking it over, and I am going away.  My dear father and mother, for I shall always think of you so, I thank  you for all your love and kindness, which I have received through a  horrible fraud. If it had all been an accident, and you had found out  for yourselves by the likeness that Rupert was your son, I do not think  that I should have minded, at least nothing like so much. I should, of  course, have been very grieved that you were not my father and mother,  and that Rupert and Madge were not my brother and sister; but it would  have been nobody's fault, and I am sure that you would all still have  loved me. But to know that it has been a wicked fraud, that I have been  an impostor palmed upon you, that there has been a plot and conspiracy  to rob you, and that I have a mother who not only did this, but who  could propose to me to go on deceiving you, and even to join in a fresh  fraud and to swindle Rupert, is so awful that there is nothing for me to  do but to go away.    \"I feel sure you will all be sorry, and that though I am not your son  you would go on treating me as if I were a younger brother of Rupert's.  But I could not bear it, father. I could not accept anything from you,  for I should feel that it was the result of this wicked fraud, that it  was what this woman, I cannot call her mother, had schemed for me to  get. Some day when I have made my way, and when all this may not hurt me  so horribly as it seems to do now, I will come and see you all if you  will let me, to thank you all for the love and kindness that should  never have been mine. But that will not be till I am in a position when  I can want nothing, for I feel now that were I dying of hunger I could  not accept a crust from your hands, for if I did so I should feel I was  a party to this abominable fraud. God bless you, dearest father and  mother and Rupert and Madge!--Your unhappy Edgar.\"          CHAPTER IV.    BACK AT SCHOOL.      It was a long time after they had, with many breaks, read Edgar's letter  to the end before Rupert and Madge could compose themselves sufficiently  to accompany their father into the drawing-room. They again broke down  when they met their mother; and it was not until Captain Clinton said,  \"Come, we must all pull ourselves together and see what is to be done,  and talk the whole matter over calmly,\" that by a great effort they  recovered their composure. \"Now, in the first place, we must try to find  Edgar. He has got twenty-four hours' start of us, but that is not very  much. I suppose you think, Rupert, that there is no doubt that he went  up to town by the night train.\"    \"I have no doubt that he got away in time to do so, father; but of  course he might have gone by the down train, which passes through  Gloucester somewhere about the same time.\"    \"I do not think it likely that he did that, Rupert. I should say he was  sure to go to London; that is almost always the goal people make for,  unless it is in the case of boys who want to go to sea, when they would  make for Liverpool or some other port. But I don't think Edgar was  likely to do that. I don't think he had any special fancy for the sea;  so we may assume that he has gone to London. What money had he?\"    \"He had that five-pound note you sent three days ago, father, to clear  off any ticks we had, and to pay our journey home. That is what he meant  when he said, 'I have taken the note, but I know you won't grudge it  me.' I think he had about a pound left--that is about what I had--and I  know when the note came he said that the money he had was enough to last  him to the end of the term. So he would have the five-pound note  untouched when he got to London, and if driven to it he could get, I  should think, six or seven pounds for his watch and chain.\"    \"That would give him enough to keep him some little time. If he had been  a couple of years older I should say that he would probably enlist at  once, as you had both made up your minds to go into the army. But  although lads do enlist under the proper age, no recruiting officer or  doctor would pass him as being eighteen. The first thing to do will be  to advertise for him--in the first place to advertise offering a reward  for information as to his whereabouts, and in the second place  advertising to him direct, begging him to come home.\"    \"But he would never come, father,\" Rupert said, looking at the letter,  which Captain Clinton still held in his hand.    \"It would depend how we advertised. Suppose I were to say, 'Statement of  woman not believed; we are in as much doubt as before.'\"    The others looked up in intense surprise.    \"Oh, father, how could you say that?\" Rupert exclaimed. \"Oh, if we could  but say so! I should be quite, quite content to know that either of us  might be her son--that would not matter so much if we felt that you  loved us both equally; but how could you say so?\"    \"Because, Rupert,\" Captain Clinton said gravely, \"I still think there is  great ground for doubt.\"    \"Do you really, father? Oh, I am pleased! I think--yes, I am sure that I  could bear now to know that Edgar is your real son, and not I. It would  be so different to learn it from your lips, to know that you all love me  still, instead of hearing it in the dreadful way Edgar did. But how do  you doubt, father? It seemed to me from reading the letter so certain.\"    \"Do you really doubt, Percy?\" Mrs. Clinton asked.    \"I do indeed, Lucy; and I will give you my reasons. In the first place,  this woman left India a few weeks after the affair. She certainly could  not have seen the children until we returned to England, and, so far as  we know, has never seen them since. If she has seen them, she never can  have spoken to them or come in any sort of contact with them, therefore  she cannot possibly have known which is which. When she saw them at  Cheltenham, and Rupert says that she was there more than a week, she met  them upon every possible occasion and stared hard at them. It is  evident, therefore, that she was for all that time doubtful. No doubt  she was doing what we used to do, trying to detect a resemblance. Now,  if we in all these years with the boys, constantly watching their ways  and listening to their voices, could detect no resemblance, it is  extremely improbable that she was able to do so from merely seeing them  a score of times walking in the streets. I do not say that it is  impossible she could have done so; I only say it is extremely  improbable; and I think it much more likely that, finding she could see  no resemblance whatever, she determined to speak to the first whom she  might happen to find alone.\"    \"But there is the mark, father,\" Rupert said.    \"Yes, there is the mark,\" Mrs. Clinton repeated.    \"I did not know you had a mark, Rupert. I wonder we never noticed it,  Lucy.\"    \"It is a very tiny one, father. I never noticed it myself--indeed I can  hardly see it before a glass, for it is rather at the back of the  shoulder--until Edgar noticed it one day. It is not larger than the head  of a good-sized pin. It is a little dark-brown mole. Perhaps it was  smaller and lighter when I was a baby; but it must have been there then,  or she would not have known about it.\"    \"That is so, Rupert; but the mere fact that it is there does not in any  way prove that you are our son. Just see what Edgar says about it in his  letter. Remember the woman could not have known which of you boys had  the mark; and that she did not know, that is to say, that she had not  recognized the likeness, appears from Edgar's letter. This is what he  says: 'She said that one of us had a small mole on the shoulder. I knew  that Rupert had a tiny mole there; and she said that was the mark by  which she knew your son from hers.' Suppose Edgar had replied, 'Yes, I  have such a mark on my shoulder,' might she not have said, that is the  mark by which I can distinguish my son from that of Captain Clinton?\"    The others were silent. Then Mrs. Clinton said, \"You know, Percy, I do  not wish to prove that one more than the other of the boys is ours; but  naturally the woman would wish to benefit her own boy, and if it had  been her own boy who had the mark, why should she not have told Edgar  that she had made a mistake, and that it was Rupert who was her son?\"    \"I do not suppose, Lucy, that she cared in the slightest which was her  son; her main object, of course, was to extort money. Edgar does not say  anything at all about that; and of course at first she would try and  make out that she was ready to sacrifice herself for him, and would  scarcely say that she expected him to make her a handsome allowance when  he came into the property, but I have no doubt that was her motive.  Well, you see, she had already begun with Edgar. Suppose she said that  she had made a mistake, and Rupert was her son. Edgar would have gone in  and told him, and would probably have telegraphed to me, so that I could  get to Rupert before this woman saw him, and she would have known then  that her story would have been upset altogether. No court of law would  attach any weight to what she might say. She would have to stand  confessed as having been concerned in a gross fraud, and with having  lied at first; and unless she was in a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22010"],[0,"The Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces of India, Volume 2 (#12)"],[1,"and Baoria tribes is added at the end.        2. The Badhak dacoits.      The origin of the Badhaks is obscure, but they seem to have belonged  to Gujarat, as their peculiar dialect, still in use, is a form of  Gujarati. The most striking feature in it is the regular substitution  of _kh_ for _s_. They claimed to be Rajputs and were divided into clans  with the well-known Rajput names of Solanki, Panwar, Dhundhel, Chauhan,  Rathor, Gahlot, Bhatti and Charan. Their ancestors were supposed to  have fled from Chitor on one of the historical occasions on which it  was assaulted and sacked. But as they spoke Gujarati it seems more  probable that they belonged to Gujarat, a fertile breeding-place of  criminals, and they may have been descended from the alliances of  Rajputs with the primitive tribes of this locality, the Bhils and  Kolis. The existing Bagris are of short stature, one writer stating  that none of them exceed five feet two inches in height; and this  seems to indicate that they have little Rajput blood. It may be  surmised that the Badhaks rose into importance and found scope for  their predatory instincts during the period of general disorder and  absence of governing authority through which northern India passed  after the decline of the Mughal Empire. And they lived and robbed with  the connivance or open support of the petty chiefs and landholders,  to whom they gave a liberal share of their booty. The principal bands  were located in the Oudh forests, but they belonged to the whole  of northern India including the Central Provinces; and as Colonel  Sleeman's Report, though of much interest, is now practically unknown,  I have thought it not out of place to compile an article by means of  short extracts from his account of the tribe.    In 1822 the operations of the Badhaks were being conducted on such a  scale that an officer wrote: \"No District between the Brahmaputra,  the Nerbudda, the Satlej and the Himalayas is free from them; and  within this vast field hardly any wealthy merchant or manufacturer  could feel himself secure for a single night from the depredations  of Badhak dacoits. They had successfully attacked so many of the  treasuries of our native Sub-Collectors that it was deemed necessary,  all over the North-Western Provinces, to surround such buildings with  extensive fortifications. In many cases they carried off our public  treasure from strong parties of our regular troops and mounted police;  and none seemed to know whence they came or whither they fled with  the booty acquired.\" [42]        3. Instances of dacoities.      Colonel Sleeman thus described a dacoity in the town of Narsinghpur  when he was in charge of that District: [43] \"In February 1822,  in the dusk of the evening, a party of about thirty persons, with  nothing seemingly but walking-sticks in their hands, passed the  piquet of sepoys on the bank of the rivulet which separates the  cantonment from the town of Narsinghpur. On being challenged by  the sentries they said they were cowherds and that their cattle were  following close behind. They walked up the street; and coming opposite  the houses of the most wealthy merchants, they set their torches  in a blaze by blowing suddenly on pots filled with combustibles,  stabbed everybody who ventured to move or make the slightest noise,  plundered the houses, and in ten minutes were away with their booty,  leaving about twelve persons dead and wounded on the ground. No trace  of them was discovered.\" Another well-known exploit of the Badhaks  was the attack on the palace of the ex-Peshwa, Baji Rao, at Bithur  near Cawnpore. This was accomplished by a gang of about eighty men,  who proceeded to the locality in the disguise of carriers of Ganges  water. Having purchased a boat and a few muskets to intimidate  the guard they crossed the Ganges about six miles below Bithur,  and reached the place at ten o'clock at night; and after wounding  eighteen persons who attempted resistance they possessed themselves  of property, chiefly in gold, to the value of more than two and a  half lakhs of rupees; and retiring without loss made their way in  safety to their homes in the Oudh forests. The residence of this  gang was known to a British police officer in the King of Oudh's  service, Mr. Orr, and after a long delay on the part of the court  an expedition was sent which recovered a portion of the treasure  and captured two or three hundred of the Badhaks. But none of the  recovered property reached the hands of Baji Rao and the prisoners  were soon afterwards released. [44] Again in 1839, a gang of about  fifty men under a well-known leader, Gajraj, scaled the walls of  Jhansi and plundered the Surafa or bankers' quarter of the town for  two hours, obtaining booty to the value of Rs. 40,000, which they  carried off without the loss of a man. The following account of this  raid was obtained by Colonel Sleeman from one of the robbers: [45]  \"The spy (_hirrowa_) having returned and reported that he had found a  merchant's house in Jhansi which contained a good deal of property,  we proceeded to a grove where we took the auspices by the process  of _akut_ (counting of grains) and found the omens favourable. We  then rested three days and settled the rates according to which the  booty should be shared. Four or five men, who were considered too  feeble for the enterprise, were sent back, and the rest, well armed,  strong and full of courage, went on. In the evening of the fourth day  we reached a plain about a mile from the town, where we rested to take  breath for an hour; about nine o'clock we got to the wall and remained  under it till midnight, preparing the ladders from materials which we  had collected on the road. They were placed to the wall and we entered  and passed through the town without opposition. A marriage procession  was going on before us and the people thought we belonged to it. We  found the bankers' shops closed. Thana and Saldewa, who carried the  axes, soon broke them open, while Kulean lighted up his torch. Gajraj  with twenty men entered, while the rest stood posted at the different  avenues leading to the place. When all the property they could find  had been collected, Gajraj hailed the god Hanuman and gave orders for  the retreat. We got back safely to Mondegri in two days and a half,  and then reposed for two or three days with the Raja of Narwar,  with whom we left five or six of our stoutest men as a guard, and  then returned home with our booty, consisting chiefly of diamonds,  emeralds, gold and silver bullion, rupees and about sixty pounds  of silver wire. None of our people were either killed or wounded,  but whether any of the bankers' people were I know not.\"        4. Further instances of dacoities.      Colonel Sleeman writes elsewhere [46] of the leader of the above  exploit: \"This Gajraj had risen from the vocation of a _bandarwala_  (monkey showman) to be the Robin Hood of Gwalior and the adjacent  States; he was the governor-general of banditti in that country of  banditti and kept the whole in awe; he had made himself so formidable  that the Durbar appointed him to keep the _ghats_ or ferries over  the Chambal, which he did in a very profitable manner to them and  to himself, and none entered or quitted the country without paying  blackmail.\" A common practice of the Badhaks, when in need of a little  ready money, was to lie in wait for money-changers on their return  from the markets. These men take their bags of money with them to the  important bazars at a distance from their residence and return home  with them after dusk. The dacoits were accustomed to watch for them  in the darkest and most retired places on the roads and fell them  to the ground with their bludgeons. This device was often practised  and usually succeeded. [47] Of another Badhak chief, Meherban, it is  stated [48] that he hired a discharged sepoy to instruct his followers  in the European system of drill, that they might travel with him in  the disguise of regular soldiers, well armed and accoutred. During  the rains Meherban's spies (_hirrowa_) were sent to visit the great  commercial towns and report any despatches of money or other valuables,  which were to take place during the following open season. His own  favourite disguise was that of a Hindu prince, while the remainder  of the gang constituted his retinue and escort. On one occasion,  assuming this character, he followed up a boat laden with Spanish  dollars which was being sent from Calcutta to Benares; and having  attacked it at its moorings at Makrai, he killed one and wounded ten  men of the guard and made off with 25,000 Spanish dollars and Rs. 2600  of the Company's coinage. A part of the band were sent direct to the  rendezvous previously arranged, while Meherban returned to the grove  where he had left his women and proceeded with them in a more leisurely  fashion to the same place. Retaining the character of a native prince  he halted here for two days to celebrate the Holi festival. Marching  thence with his women conveyed in covered litters by hired bearers  who were changed at intervals, he proceeded to his bivouac in the  Oudh forests; and at Seosagar, one of his halting-places, he gave  a large sum of money to a gardener to plant a grove of mango trees  near a tank for the benefit of travellers, in the name of Raja  Meherban Singh of Gaur in Oudh; and promised him further alms on  future occasions of pilgrimage if he found the work progressing well,  saying that it was a great shame that travellers should be compelled  as he had been to halt without shade for themselves or their families  during the heat of the day. He arrived safely at his quarters in the  forest and was received in the customary fashion by a procession of  women in their best attire, who conducted him with dancing and music,  like a victorious Roman Proconsul, to his fort.
