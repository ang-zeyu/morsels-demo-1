Then the number was further limited by the necessity of  finding an eclipse which could have been seen at the place which was the  Emperor's capital. The site of this, again, was a matter of some  uncertainty. However, step by step, by a judicious process of  exhaustion, the year 2136 B.C. was arrived at as the alternative to the  previously received date of 2128 B.C. Considering that we are dealing  with a matter which happened full 4000 years ago, it may fairly be said  that this discrepancy is not perhaps much to be wondered at, seeing what  disputes often happen nowadays as to the precise date of events which  may have occurred but a few years or even a few months before the  controversy springs up.    Professor Russell says that:--\"Some admirers of the Chinese cite this  eclipse as a proof of the early proficiency attained by the Chinese in  astronomical calculations. I find no ground for that belief in the text.  Indeed, for many centuries later, the Chinese were unable to predict the  position of the Sun accurately among the stars. They relied wholly on  observation to settle their calendar, year by year, and seem to have  drawn no conclusions or deductions from their observations. Their  calendar was continually falling into confusion. Even at the beginning  of this dynasty, when the Jesuits came to China, the Chinese  astronomers were unable to calculate accurately the length of the shadow  of the Sun at the equinoxes and solstices. It seems to me therefore very  improbable that they could have been able to calculate and predict  eclipses.\"    I am not at all sure that this is quite a fair presentation of the case.  I do not remember ever to have seen the power to predict eclipses  ascribed to the Chinese, but it is a simple matter of fact that we owe  to them during many centuries unique records of a vast number of  celestial phenomena. Their observations of comets may be singled out as  having been of inestimable value to various 19th-century computers,  especially E. Biot and J. R. Hind.    The second recorded eclipse of the Sun would seem to be also due to the  Chinese. Confucius relates that during the reign of the Emperor Yew-Wang  an eclipse took place. This Emperor reigned between 781 B.C. and 771  B.C., and it has been generally thought that the eclipse of 775 B.C. is  the one referred to, but Johnson doubts this on the ground that this  eclipse was chiefly visible in the circumpolar regions, and if seen at  all in China must have been of very small dimensions. He leans to the  eclipse of June 4, 780 B.C. as the only large one which happened within  the limits of time stated above.    An ancient Chinese historical work, known as the _Chun-Tsew_, written by  Confucius, makes mention of a large number of solar eclipses which  occurred before the Christian Era. This work came under the notice of M.  Gaubil, one of the French Jesuit missionaries who laboured in China  some century and a half ago, and he first gave an account of it in his  _Traite de la Chronologie Chinoise_, published at Paris in 1770.[21]    The _Chun-Tsew_ is said to be the only work really written by  Kung-Foo-Tze, commonly known as Confucius, the other treatises  attributed to him having been compiled by disciples of his either during  his life-time or after his decease. The German chronologist, Ideler, was  acquainted with this work, and in a paper of his own, presented to the  Berlin Academy, remarked:--\"What gives great interest to this work is the  account of 36 solar eclipses observed in China, the first of which was  on Feb. 22, 720 B.C., and the last on July 22, 495 B.C.\"    In 1863 Mr. John Williams, then Assistant Secretary of the Royal  Astronomical Society, communicated to the Society in a condensed form  the particulars of these eclipses as related in Confucius's book,  together with some remarks on the book itself. The _Chun-Tsew_ treats of  a part of the history of the confederated nations into which China was  divided during the Chow Dynasty, that is between 1122 B.C. and 255 B.C.  The particular period dealt with is that which extended from 722 B.C. to  479 B.C. It was during the latter part of this interval of about 242  years that Confucius flourished. But the book is not quite a general  history for it is more particularly devoted to the small State of Loo  of which Confucius was a native, where he passed a great portion of his  life, and where he was advanced to the highest honours. It contains the  history of twelve princes of this State with incidental notices of the  other confederated nations. The number of the years of each reign is  accurately determined, and the events are classed under the years in  which they occurred. Each year is divided into sections according to the  four seasons, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, and the sections are  subdivided into months, and often the days are distinguished. The name  _Chun-Tsew_ is said to have been given to this work from its having been  commenced in Spring and finished in Autumn, but Williams thinks that the  name rather refers to the fact that its contents are divided into  seasons as stated. The style in which it is written is very concise,  being a bare mention of facts without comment, and although on this  account it might appear to us dry and uninteresting, it is much valued  by the Chinese as a model of the ancient style of writing. It forms one  of the _Woo-King_ or Five Classical Books, without a thorough knowledge  of which, and of the _Sze-Shoo_ or Four Books, no man can attain to any  post of importance in the Chinese Empire.    The account of each eclipse is but little more than a brief mention of  its occurrence at a certain time. The following is an example of the  entries:--\"In the 58th year of the 32nd cycle in the 51st year of the  Emperor King-Wang, of the Chow Dynasty, the 3rd year of Yin-Kung, Prince  of Loo, in the spring, the second moon, on the day called Kea-Tsze,  there was an eclipse of the Sun.\" This 58th year of the 32nd cycle  answers to 720 B.C. Mr. Williams in the year 1863 presented to the Royal  Astronomical Society a paper setting out the whole of the eclipses of  which I have cited but one example, converting, of course, the very  complicated Chinese dates into European dates.    These Chinese records of eclipses were in 1864 subjected to examination  by the late Sir G. B. Airy,[22] with results which were highly  noteworthy, and justify us in reposing much confidence in Chinese  astronomical work. Airy remarks:--\"The period through which these  eclipses extend is included in the time through which calculations of  eclipses have been made in the French work entitled _L'Art de verifier  les Dates_. I have several times had occasion to recalculate with great  accuracy eclipses which are noted in that work (edition of 1820), and I  have found that, to the limits of accuracy to which it pretends, and  which are abundantly sufficient for the present purpose, it is perfectly  trustworthy. I have therefore made a comparison of the _Chun-Tsew_  eclipses with those of _L'Art de verifier les Dates_. The result is  interesting. Of the 36 eclipses, 32 agree with those of the _Art de  verifier les Dates_, not only in the day, but also in the general track  of the eclipse as given in the _Art de verifier_, which appears to show  sufficiently that the eclipse would be visible in that province of China  to which the _Chun-Tsew_ is referred.\" Airy then proceeds to point out  that, with regard to the four eclipses which he could not confirm, there  cannot have been eclipses in April 645 B.C. or in June 592 B.C. It  appears, however, from a note by Williams, that the date attached to the  eclipse of 645 B.C. is, in reality, an erroneous repetition (in the  Chinese mode of expressing it) of that attached to the next following  one, and in the absence of correct date it must be rejected. In the  record of 592 B.C., June 16, no clerical error is found, and there must  be an error of a different class. The eclipses of 552 B.C., September  19, and 549 B.C., July 18, to which there is nothing corresponding in  the _Art de verifier_, are in a different category. These occur in the  lunations immediately succeeding 552 B.C., August 20, and 549 B.C., June  19, respectively, and there is no doubt that those which agree with the  _Art de verifier_ were real eclipses. Now there cannot be eclipses  visible at the same place in successive lunations, because the  difference of the Moon's longitudes is about 29 deg., and the difference of  latitudes is therefore nearly 3 deg., which is greater than the sum of the  diameters of the Sun and Moon increased by any possible change of  parallax for the same place. These, therefore, were not real eclipses.  It seems probable that the nominal days were set down by the observer in  his memorandum book as days on which eclipses were to be looked for.  Airy conjectured that the eclipses of 552 B.C., August 20, and 549 B.C.,  June 19, were observed by one and the same person, and that he possessed  science enough to make him connect the solar eclipses with the change  of the Moon, but not enough to give him any idea of the limitations to  the visibility of an eclipse.    On a subsequent occasion Mr. Williams laid before the Society a further  list of solar eclipses observed in China, and extending from 481 B.C. to  the Christian Era. He collected these from a Chinese historical work,  entitled _Tung-Keen-Kang-Muh_. This work, which runs to 101 volumes,  contains a summary of Chinese history from the earliest times to the end  of the Yuen Dynasty, A.D. 1368, and was first published about 1473. The  copy in Mr. Williams's possession was published in 1808. The text is  very briefly worded, and consists"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24236"],[0,"Time and Tide: A Romance of the Moon (#12)"],[1,"matter I am entering somewhat largely into  mathematical principles; I must only endeavour to state the matter as  succinctly as the subject will admit.    In an earlier part of this lecture I have explained how, during all  the development of the earth-moon system, the quantity of moment of  momentum remains unaltered. The moment of momentum of the earth's  rotation added to the moment of momentum of the moon's revolution  remains constant; if one of these quantities increase the other must  decrease, and the progress of the evolution will have this result,  that energy shall be gradually lost in consequence of the friction  produced by the tides. The investigation is one appropriate for  mathematical formulae, such as those that can be found in Professor  Darwin's memoirs; but nature has in this instance dealt kindly with  us, for she has enabled an abstruse mathematical principle to be dealt  with in a singularly clear and concise manner. We want to obtain a  definite view of the alteration in the energy of the system which  shall correspond to a small change in the velocity of the earth's  rotation, the moon of course accommodating itself so that the moment  of momentum shall be preserved unaltered. We can use for this purpose  an angular velocity which represents the excess of the earth's  rotation over the angular revolution of the moon; it is, in fact, the  apparent angular velocity with which the moon appears to move round  the heavens. If we represent by N the angular velocity of the earth,  and by M the angular velocity of the moon in its orbit round the  earth, the quantity we desire to express is N--M; we shall call it the  relative rotation. The mathematical theorem which tells us what we  want can be enunciated in a concise manner as follows. _The alteration  of the energy of the system may be expressed by multiplying the  relative rotation by the change in the earth's angular velocity._ This  result will explain many points to us in the theory, but just at  present I am only going to make a single inference from it.    I must advert for a moment to the familiar conception of a maximum or  a minimum. If a magnitude be increasing, that is, gradually growing  greater and greater, it has obviously not attained a maximum so long  as the growth is in progress. Nor if the object be actually decreasing  can it be said to be at a maximum either; for then it was greater a  second ago than it is now, and therefore it cannot be at a maximum at  present. We may illustrate this by the familiar example of a stone  thrown up into the air; at first it gradually rises, being higher at  each instant than it was previously, until a culminating point is  reached, when just for a moment the stone is poised at the summit of  its path ere it commences its return to earth again. In this case the  maximum point is obtained when the stone, having ceased to ascend, and  not having yet commenced to descend, is momentarily at rest.    The same principles apply to the determination of a minimum. As long  as the magnitude is declining the minimum has not been reached; it is  only when the decline has ceased, and an increase is on the point of  setting in, that the minimum can be said to be touched.    The earth-moon system contains at any moment a certain store of  energy, and to every conceivable condition of the earth-moon system a  certain quantity of energy is appropriate. It is instructive for us to  study the different positions in which the earth and the moon might  lie, and to examine the different quantities of energy which the  system will contain in each of those varied positions. It is however  to be understood that the different cases all presuppose the same  total moment of momentum.    Among the different cases that can be imagined, those will be of  special interest in which the total quantity of energy in the system  is a maximum or a minimum. We must for this purpose suppose the system  gradually to run through all conceivable changes, with the earth and  moon as near as possible, and as far as possible, and in all  intermediate positions; we must also attribute to the earth every  variety in the velocity of its rotation which is compatible with the  preservation of the moment of momentum. Beginning then with the  earth's velocity of rotation at its lowest, we may suppose it  gradually and continually increased, and, as we have already seen, the  change in the energy of the system is to be expressed by multiplying  the relative rotation into the change of the earth's angular velocity.  It follows from the principles we have already explained, that the  maximum or minimum energy is attained at the moment when the  alteration is zero. It therefore follows, that the critical periods of  the system will arise when the relative rotation is zero, that is,  when the earth's rotation on its axis is performed with a velocity  equal to that with which the moon revolves around the earth. This is  truly a singular condition of the earth-moon system; the moon in such  a case would revolve around the earth as if the two bodies were bound  together by rigid bonds into what was practically a single solid body.  At the present moment no doubt to some extent this condition is  realized, because the moon always turns the same face to the earth (a  point on which we shall have something to say later on); but in the  original condition of the earth-moon system, the earth would also  constantly direct the same face to the moon, a condition of things  which is now very far from being realized.    It can be shown from the mathematical nature of the problem that there  are four states of the earth-moon system in which this condition may  be realized, and which are also compatible with the conservation of  the moment of momentum. We can express what this condition implies in  a somewhat more simple manner. Let us understand by the _day_ the  period of the earth's rotation on its axis, whatever that may be, and  let us understand by the _month_ the period of revolution of the moon  around the earth, whatever value it may have; then the condition of  maximum or minimum energy is attained when the day and the month have  become equal to each other. Of the four occasions mathematically  possible in which the day and the month can be equal, there are only  two which at present need engage our attention--one of these occurred  near the beginning of the earth and moon's history, the other remains  to be approached in the immeasurably remote future. The two remaining  solutions are futile, being what the mathematician would describe as  imaginary.    There is a fundamental difference between the dynamical conditions in  these critical epochs--in one of them the energy of the system has  attained a maximum value, and in the other the energy of the system is  at a minimum value. It is impossible to over-estimate the significance  of these two states of the system.    I may recall the fundamental notion which every one has learned in  mechanics, as to the difference between stable and unstable  equilibrium. The conceivable possibility of making an egg stand on its  end is a practical impossibility, because nature does not like  unstable equilibrium, and a body departs therefrom on the least  disturbance; on the other hand, stable equilibrium is the position in  which nature tends to place everything. A log of wood floating on a  river might conceivably float in a vertical position with its end up  out of the water, but you never could succeed in so balancing it,  because no matter how carefully you adjusted the log, it would almost  instantly turn over when you left it free; on the other hand, when the  log floats naturally on the water it assumes a horizontal position, to  which, when momentarily displaced therefrom, it will return if  permitted to do so. We have here an illustration of the contrast  between stable and unstable equilibrium. It will be found generally  that a body is in equilibrium when its centre of gravity is at its  highest point or at its lowest point; there is, however, this  important difference, that when the centre of gravity is highest the  equilibrium is unstable, and when the centre of gravity is lowest the  equilibrium is stable. The potential energy of an egg poised on its  end in unstable equilibrium is greater than when it lies on its side  in stable equilibrium. In fact, energy must be expended to raise the  egg from the horizontal position to the vertical; while, on the other  hand, work could conceivably be done by the egg when it passes from  the vertical position to the horizontal. Speaking generally, we may  say that the stable position indicates low energy, while a redundancy  of that valuable agent is suggestive of instability.    We may apply similar principles to the consideration of the earth-moon  system. It is true that we have here a series of dynamical phenomena,  while the illustrations I have given of stable and unstable  equilibrium relate only to statical problems; but we can have  dynamical stability and dynamical instability, just as we can have  stable and unstable equilibrium. Dynamical instability corresponds  with the maximum of energy, and dynamical stability to the minimum of  energy.    At that primitive epoch, when the energy of the earth-moon system was  a maximum, the condition was one of dynamical instability; it was  impossible that it should last. But now mark how truly critical an  occurrence this must have been in the history of the earth-moon  system, for have I not already explained that it is a necessary  condition of the progress of tidal evolution that the energy of the  system should be always declining? But here our retrospect has  conducted us back to a most eventful crisis, in which the energy was a  maximum, and therefore cannot have been immediately preceded by a  state in which the energy was greater still; it is therefore  impossible for the tidal evolution to"]]]
