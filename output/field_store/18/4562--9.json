The gund examined him from head to foot, making  comments, especially upon the shape and size of his thumbs and great  toes.    \"With these and with no tail,\" he said, \"it cannot climb.\"    \"No,\" agreed one of the warriors, \"it would surely fall even from the  cliff pegs.\"    \"I have never seen a thing like it,\" said the chief. \"It is neither  Waz-don nor Ho-don. I wonder from whence it came and what it is called.\"    \"The Kor-ul-JA shouted aloud, 'Tarzan-jad-guru!' and we thought that  they might be calling this one,\" said a warrior. \"Shall we kill it now?\"    \"No,\" replied the chief, \"we will wait until its life returns into its  head that I may question it. Remain here, In-tan, and watch it. When it  can again hear and speak call me.\"    He turned and departed from the cave, the others, except In-tan,  following him. As they moved past him and out of the chamber Tarzan  caught snatches of their conversation which indicated that the  Kor-ul-JA reinforcements had fallen upon their little party in great  numbers and driven them away. Evidently the swift feet of Id-an had  saved the day for the warriors of Om-at. The ape-man smiled, then he  partially opened an eye and cast it upon In-tan. The warrior stood at  the entrance to the cave looking out--his back was toward his prisoner.  Tarzan tested the bonds that secured his wrists. They seemed none too  stout and they had tied his hands in front of him! Evidence indeed that  the Waz-don took few prisoners--if any.    Cautiously he raised his wrists until he could examine the thongs that  confined them. A grim smile lighted his features. Instantly he was at  work upon the bonds with his strong teeth, but ever a wary eye was upon  In-tan, the warrior of Kor-ul-lul. The last knot had been loosened and  Tarzan's hands were free when In-tan turned to cast an appraising eye  upon his ward. He saw that the prisoner's position was changed--he no  longer lay upon his back as they had left him, but upon his side and  his hands were drawn up against his face. In-tan came closer and bent  down. The bonds seemed very loose upon the prisoner's wrists. He  extended his hand to examine them with his fingers and instantly the  two hands leaped from their bonds--one to seize his own wrist, the  other his throat. So unexpected the catlike attack that In-tan had not  even time to cry out before steel fingers silenced him. The creature  pulled him suddenly forward so that he lost his balance and rolled over  upon the prisoner and to the floor beyond to stop with Tarzan upon his  breast. In-tan struggled to release himself--struggled to draw his  knife; but Tarzan found it before him. The Waz-don's tail leaped to the  other's throat, encircling it--he too could choke; but his own knife,  in the hands of his antagonist, severed the beloved member close to its  root.    The Waz-don's struggles became weaker--a film was obscuring his vision.  He knew that he was dying and he was right. A moment later he was dead.  Tarzan rose to his feet and placed one foot upon the breast of his dead  foe. How the urge seized him to roar forth the victory cry of his kind!  But he dared not. He discovered that they had not removed his rope from  his shoulders and that they had replaced his knife in its sheath. It  had been in his hand when he was felled. Strange creatures! He did not  know that they held a superstitious fear of the weapons of a dead  enemy, believing that if buried without them he would forever haunt his  slayers in search of them and that when he found them he would kill the  man who killed him. Against the wall leaned his bow and quiver of  arrows.    Tarzan stepped toward the doorway of the cave and looked out. Night had  just fallen. He could hear voices from the nearer caves and there  floated to his nostrils the odor of cooking food. He looked down and  experienced a sensation of relief. The cave in which he had been held  was in the lowest tier--scarce thirty feet from the base of the cliff.  He was about to chance an immediate descent when there occurred to him  a thought that brought a grin to his savage lips--a thought that was  born of the name the Waz-don had given him--Tarzan-jad-guru--Tarzan the  Terrible--and a recollection of the days when he had delighted in  baiting the blacks of the distant jungle of his birth. He turned back  into the cave where lay the dead body of In-tan. With his knife he  severed the warrior's head and carrying it to the outer edge of the  recess tossed it to the ground below, then he dropped swiftly and  silently down the ladder of pegs in a way that would have surprised the  Kor-ul-lul who had been so sure that he could not climb.    At the bottom he picked up the head of In-tan and disappeared among the  shadows of the trees carrying the grisly trophy by its shock of shaggy  hair. Horrible? But you are judging a wild beast by the standards of  civilization. You may teach a lion tricks, but he is still a lion.  Tarzan looked well in a Tuxedo, but he was still a Tarmangani and  beneath his pleated shirt beat a wild and savage heart.    Nor was his madness lacking in method. He knew that the hearts of the  Kor-ul-lul would be filled with rage when they discovered the thing  that he had done and he knew too, that mixed with the rage would be a  leaven of fear and it was fear of him that had made Tarzan master of  many jungles--one does not win the respect of the killers with bonbons.    Below the village Tarzan returned to the foot of the cliff searching  for a point where he could make the ascent to the ridge and thus back  to the village of Om-at, the Kor-ul-JA. He came at last to a place  where the river ran so close to the rocky wall that he was forced to  swim it in search of a trail upon the opposite side and here it was  that his keen nostrils detected a familiar spoor. It was the scent of  Pan-at-lee at the spot where she had emerged from the pool and taken to  the safety of the jungle.    Immediately the ape-man's plans were changed. Pan-at-lee lived, or at  least she had lived after the leap from the cliff's summit. He had  started in search of her for Om-at, his friend, and for Om-at he would  continue upon the trail he had picked up thus fortuitously by accident.  It led him into the jungle and across the gorge and then to the point  at which Pan-at-lee had commenced the ascent of the opposite cliffs.  Here Tarzan abandoned the head of In-tan, tying it to the lower branch  of a tree, for he knew that it would handicap him in his ascent of the  steep escarpment.  Apelike he ascended, following easily the scent  spoor of Pan-at-lee. Over the summit and across the ridge the trail  lay, plain as a printed page to the delicate senses of the jungle-bred  tracker.    Tarzan knew naught of the Kor-ul-GRYF. He had seen, dimly in the  shadows of the night, strange, monstrous forms and Ta-den and Om-at had  spoken of great creatures that all men feared; but always, everywhere,  by night and by day, there were dangers. From infancy death had  stalked, grim and terrible, at his heels. He knew little of any other  existence. To cope with danger was his life and he lived his life as  simply and as naturally as you live yours amidst the dangers of the  crowded city streets. The black man who goes abroad in the jungle by  night is afraid, for he has spent his life since infancy surrounded by  numbers of his own kind and safeguarded, especially at night, by such  crude means as lie within his powers. But Tarzan had lived as the lion  lives and the panther and the elephant and the ape--a true jungle  creature dependent solely upon his prowess and his wits, playing a lone  hand against creation. Therefore he was surprised at nothing and feared  nothing and so he walked through the strange night as undisturbed and  unapprehensive as the farmer to the cow lot in the darkness before the  dawn.    Once more Pan-at-lee's trail ended at the verge of a cliff; but this  time there was no indication that she had leaped over the edge and a  moment's search revealed to Tarzan the stone pegs upon which she had  made her descent. As he lay upon his belly leaning over the top of the  cliff examining the pegs his attention was suddenly attracted by  something at the foot of the cliff. He could not distinguish its  identity, but he saw that it moved and presently that it was ascending  slowly, apparently by means of pegs similar to those directly below  him. He watched it intently as it rose higher and higher until he was  able to distinguish its form more clearly, with the result that he  became convinced that it more nearly resembled some form of great ape  than a lower order. It had a tail, though, and in other respects it did  not seem a true ape.    Slowly it ascended to the upper tier of caves, into one of which it  disappeared. Then Tarzan took up again the trail of Pan-at-lee. He  followed it down the stone pegs to the nearest cave and then further  along the upper tier. The ape-man raised his eyebrows when he saw the  direction in which it led, and quickened his pace. He had almost  reached the third cave when the echoes of Kor-ul-GRYF were awakened by  a shrill scream of terror.      [1] I have used the Pal-ul-don word for gorge with the English plural,  which is not the correct native plural form. The latter, it seems to  me, is awkward for us and so I have generally ignored it throughout my  manuscript, permitting, for example, Kor-ul-JA to answer for both  singular and plural. However, for the benefit of those who may be  interested in such things I may say that the plurals are formed simply  for all words in the Pal-ul-don language by doubling the initial letter  of the word, as k'kor, gorges, pronounced as though written kakor, the  a having the sound of a in sofa.

Ralph, though married, and having one child, had determined to  accompany me in this voyage. It was thought he intended to establish a  correspondence, and obtain goods to sell on commission; but I found  afterwards, that, thro' some discontent with his wife's relations, he  purposed to leave her on their hands, and never return again. Having  taken leave of my friends, and interchang'd some promises with Miss  Read, I left Philadelphia in the ship, which anchor'd at Newcastle.  The governor was there; but when I went to his lodging, the secretary  came to me from him with the civillest message in the world, that he  could not then see me, being engaged in business of the utmost  importance, but should send the letters to me on board, wished me  heartily a good voyage and a speedy return, etc. I returned on board a  little puzzled, but still not doubting.    Mr. Andrew Hamilton, a famous lawyer of Philadelphia, had taken  passage in the same ship for himself and son, and with Mr. Denham, a  Quaker merchant, and Messrs. Onion and Russel, masters of an iron work  in Maryland, had engaged the great cabin; so that Ralph and I were  forced to take up with a berth in the steerage, and none on board  knowing us, were considered as ordinary persons. But Mr. Hamilton and  his son (it was James, since governor) return'd from Newcastle to  Philadelphia, the father being recall'd by a great fee to plead for a  seized ship; and, just before we sail'd, Colonel French coming on  board, and showing me great respect, I was more taken notice of, and,  with my friend Ralph, invited by the other gentlemen to come into the  cabin, there being now room. Accordingly, we remov'd thither.    Understanding that Colonel French had brought on board the governor's  despatches, I ask'd the captain for those letters that were to be  under my care. He said all were put into the bag together and he could  not then come at them; but, before we landed in England, I should have  an opportunity of picking them out; so I was satisfied for the  present, and we proceeded on our voyage. We had a sociable company in  the cabin, and lived uncommonly well, having the addition of all Mr.  Hamilton's stores, who had laid in plentifully. In this passage Mr.  Denham contracted a friendship for me that continued during his life.  The voyage was otherwise not a pleasant one, as we had a great deal of  bad weather.    When we came into the Channel, the captain kept his word with me, and  gave me an opportunity of examining the bag for the governor's  letters. I found none upon which my name was put as under my care. I  picked out six or seven, that, by the handwriting, I thought might be  the promised letters, especially as one of them was directed to  Basket, the king's printer, and another to some stationer. We arriv'd  in London the 24th of December, 1724. I waited upon the stationer, who  came first in my way, delivering the letter as from Governor Keith. \"I  don't know such a person,\" says he; but, opening the letter, \"O! this  is from Riddlesden. I have lately found him to be a compleat rascal,  and I will have nothing to do with him, nor receive any letters from  him.\" So, putting the letter into my hand, he turn'd on his heel and  left me to serve some customer. I was surprized to find these were not  the governor's letters; and, after recollecting and comparing  circumstances, I began to doubt his sincerity. I found my friend  Denham, and opened the whole affair to him. He let me into Keith's  character; told me there was not the least probability that he had  written any letters for me; that no one, who knew him, had the  smallest dependence on him; and he laught at the notion of the  governor's giving me a letter of credit, having, as he said, no credit  to give. On my expressing some concern about what I should do, he  advised me to endeavour getting some employment in the way of my  business. \"Among the printers here,\" said he, \"you will improve  yourself, and when you return to America, you will set up to greater  advantage.\"    [Illustration: \"So, putting the letter into my hand\"]    We both of us happen'd to know, as well as the stationer, that  Riddlesden, the attorney, was a very knave. He had half ruin'd Miss  Read's father by persuading him to be bound for him. By this letter it  appear'd there was a secret scheme on foot to the prejudice of  Hamilton (suppos'd to be then coming over with us); and that Keith was  concerned in it with Riddlesden. Denham, who was a friend of  Hamilton's, thought he ought to be acquainted with it; so, when he  arriv'd in England, which was soon after, partly from resentment and  ill-will to Keith and Riddlesden, and partly from good-will to him, I  waited on him, and gave him the letter. He thank'd me cordially, the  information being of importance to him; and from that time he became  my friend, greatly to my advantage afterwards on many occasions.    But what shall we think of a governor's playing such pitiful tricks,  and imposing so grossly on a poor ignorant boy! It was a habit he had  acquired. He wish'd to please everybody; and, having little to give,  he gave expectations. He was otherwise an ingenious, sensible man, a  pretty good writer, and a good governor for the people, tho' not for  his constituents, the proprietaries, whose instructions he sometimes  disregarded. Several of our best laws were of his planning and passed  during his administration.    Ralph and I were inseparable companions. We took lodgings together in  Little Britain[36] at three shillings and sixpence a week--as much as  we could then afford. He found some relations, but they were poor, and  unable to assist him. He now let me know his intentions of remaining  in London, and that he never meant to return to Philadelphia. He had  brought no money with him, the whole he could muster having been  expended in paying his passage. I had fifteen pistoles;[37] so he  borrowed occasionally of me to subsist, while he was looking out for  business. He first endeavoured to get into the play-house, believing  himself qualify'd for an actor; but Wilkes,[38] to whom he apply'd,  advis'd him candidly not to think of that employment, as it was  impossible he should succeed in it. Then he propos'd to Roberts, a  publisher in Paternoster Row,[39] to write for him a weekly paper like  the Spectator, on certain conditions, which Roberts did not approve.  Then he endeavoured to get employment as a hackney writer, to copy for  the stationers and lawyers about the Temple,[40] but could find no  vacancy.        [36] One of the oldest parts of London, north of St.      Paul's Cathedral, called \"Little Britain\" because the      Dukes of Brittany used to live there. See the essay      entitled \"Little Britain\" in Washington Irving's _Sketch      Book_.        [37] A gold coin worth about four dollars in our money.        [38] A popular comedian, manager of Drury Lane Theater.        [39] Street north of St. Paul's, occupied by publishing      houses.        [40] Law schools and lawyers' residences situated      southwest of St. Paul's, between Fleet Street and the      Thames.    I immediately got into work at Palmer's, then a famous printing-house  in Bartholomew Close, and here I continu'd near a year. I was pretty  diligent, but spent with Ralph a good deal of my earnings in going to  plays and other places of amusement. We had together consumed all my  pistoles, and now just rubbed on from hand to mouth. He seem'd quite  to forget his wife and child, and I, by degrees, my engagements with  Miss Read, to whom I never wrote more than one letter, and that was to  let her know I was not likely soon to return. This was another of the  great errata of my life, which I should wish to correct if I were to  live it over again. In fact, by our expenses, I was constantly kept  unable to pay my passage.    At Palmer's I was employed in composing for the second edition of  Wollaston's \"Religion of Nature.\" Some of his reasonings not appearing  to me well founded, I wrote a little metaphysical piece in which I  made remarks on them. It was entitled \"A Dissertation on Liberty and  Necessity, Pleasure and Pain.\" I inscribed it to my friend Ralph; I  printed a small number. It occasion'd my being more consider'd by Mr.  Palmer as a young man of some ingenuity, tho' he seriously  expostulated with me upon the principles of my pamphlet, which to him  appear'd abominable. My printing this pamphlet was another erratum.    While I lodg'd in Little Britain, I made an acquaintance with one  Wilcox, a bookseller, whose shop was at the next door. He had an  immense collection of second-hand books. Circulating libraries were  not then in use; but we agreed that, on certain reasonable terms,  which I have now forgotten, I might take, read, and return any of his  books. This I esteem'd a great advantage, and I made as much use of it  as I could.    My pamphlet by some means falling into the hands of one Lyons, a  surgeon, author of a book entitled \"The Infallibility of Human  Judgment,\" it occasioned an acquaintance between us. He took great  notice of me, called on me often to converse on those subjects,  carried me to the Horns, a pale alehouse in----Lane, Cheapside,  and introduced me to Dr. Mandeville, author of the \"Fable of the  Bees,\" who had a club there, of which he was the soul, being a most  facetious, entertaining companion. Lyons, too, introduced me to Dr.  Pemberton, at Batson's Coffee-house, who promis'd to give me an  opportunity, sometime or other, of seeing Sir Isaac Newton, of which I  was extreamly desirous; but this never happened.    I had brought over a few curiosities, among which the principal was a  purse made of the asbestos, which purifies by fire. Sir Hans Sloane  heard of it, came to"]]]
