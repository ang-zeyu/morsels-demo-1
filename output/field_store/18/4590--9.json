Sufder expressed himself much pleased, when he heard that he was to  accompany Harry.    \"I am sick of this life of inactivity,\" he said. \"Why, we have had  no fighting for the past five years; and we shall forget how to use  our arms, unless there is something doing. I would willingly  accompany you into Scindia's camp, but I am far too well known  there to hope to escape observation. However, I will pick out  twenty of my best men so that, if there should be a skirmish, we  shall be able to hold our own. Of course, I shall choose men who  have good horses, for we may have to ride for it.\"    Harry himself was very well mounted, for Mahdoo Rao had given him  two excellent horses; and as he had, when out with Sufder's troop,  tried them against the best of those of the sowars, he felt sure  that he could trust to them, in case of having to ride for his  life. The trooper who looked after them had become much attached to  him, and he determined to take him with him into Scindia's camp,  one of Sufder's other men looking after the horses.    After a consultation with Sufder, he decided on adopting the  costume of a petty trader or pedlar carrying garments, scarfs, and  other articles used by soldiers. Of these he laid in a store and,  three hours after his interview with Nana, started with his escort;  the trooper leading his spare horse, on which his packs were  fastened, and his own man riding a country pony. The distance to  Scindia's camp was under a hundred miles, and they took three days  in accomplishing it. It was important that the horses should not be  knocked up, as their lives might depend upon their speed.    When within ten miles of their destination, they halted in a grove  near the Moola river. Here Harry changed his clothes, and assumed  those of a small merchant. Then he mounted the pony; a portion of  the packs was fastened behind him, and the rest carried by his  servant.    Scindia's camp lay around Toka, a town on the Godavery at the foot  of a range of hills. On arriving there he went to the field bazaar,  where a large number of booths, occupied by traders and country  peasants, were erected. The former principally sold arms, saddlery,  and garments; the latter, the produce of their own villages.  Choosing an unoccupied piece of ground, Harry erected a little  shelter tent; composed of a dark blanket thrown over a ridge pole,  supported by two others, giving a height of some four feet, in the  centre. The pony was picketed just behind this. In front of it a  portion of the wares was spread out, and Harry began the usual loud  exhortations, to passers by, to inspect them.    Having thus established himself, he left Wasil in charge,  explaining to him the prices that he was to ask for each of the  articles sold, and then started on a tour through the camp. Here  and there pausing to listen to the soldiers, he picked up scraps of  news; and learned that there was a general expectation that the  army would march, in a day or two, towards Poona--it being rumoured  that Scindia and his minister, Balloba, had been outwitted by Nana  Furnuwees; and that Balloba had made no secret of his anger, but  vowed vengeance against the man who had overthrown plans which, it  had been surely believed, would have resulted in Scindia's  obtaining supreme control over the Deccan.    Returning to his little tent, he wrote a letter to Nana, telling  him what he had gathered, and giving approximately the strength of  Scindia's force; adding that, from what he heard, the whole were  animated with the desire to avenge what they considered an insult  to their prince. This note he gave to Wasil, who at once started on  foot to join Sufder; who would forward it, by four troopers, to  Poona.    The next morning he returned and, after purchasing provisions from  the countrymen, and lighting a fire for cooking them, he assisted  Harry at his stall. The latter was standing up, exhibiting a  garment to a soldier, who was haggling with him over the price,  when a party of officers rode by. At their head was one whose dress  showed him to be a person of importance; and whom Harry at once  recognized as Balloba, having often noticed him during the  negotiations at Poona. As his eye fell upon Harry he checked his  horse for a moment, and beckoned to him to come to him.    \"Come here, weynsh,\" he said, using the term generally applied to  the commercial caste.    [Illustration: Harry went up to him, and salaamed.]    Harry went up to him, and salaamed.    \"How comes it,\" the minister asked, \"that so fine a young fellow as  you are is content to be peddling goods through the country, when  so well fitted by nature for better things? You should be a  soldier, and a good one. For so young a man, I have never seen a  greater promise of strength.    \"It seems to me that your face is not unknown to me. Where do you  come from?\"    \"From Jooneer, your excellency, where my people are cultivators  but, having no liking for that life, I learned the trade of a  shopkeeper, and obtained permission to travel to your camp, and to  try my fortune in disposing of some of my master's goods.\"    As Jooneer was but some sixty miles from Toka, the explanation was  natural enough and, as the former town lay near to the main road  from Scindia's dominions in Candeish, it afforded an explanation of  Balloba's partial recognition of his face.    \"And as a merchant, you can read and write, I suppose?\" the latter  went on.    \"Yes, your highness, sufficiently well for my business.\"    \"Well, think it over. You can scarcely find your present life more  suitable to your taste than that of a cultivator, and the army is  the proper place for a young fellow with spirit, and with strength  and muscles such as you have. If you like to enlist in my own  bodyguard, and your conduct be good, I will see that you have such  promotion as you deserve.\"    \"Your excellency is kind, indeed,\" Harry said, humbly. \"Before I  accept your kind offer, will you permit me to return to Jooneer to  account for my sales to my employer, and to obtain permission of my  father to accept your offer; which would indeed be greatly more to  my taste than the selling of goods.\"    \"It is well,\" Balloba said, and then broke off:    \"Ah! I know now why I remember your face. 'Tis the lightness of  your eyes, which are of a colour rarely seen; but somehow or other,  it appears to me that it was not at Jooneer, but at Poona, that I  noticed your face.\"    \"I was at Poona, with my master, when your highness was there,\"  Harry said.    \"That accounts for it.\"    The minister touched his horse's flanks with his heel and rode on,  with a thoughtful look on his face. Harry at once joined Wasil.    \"Quick, Wasil! There is no time to be lost. Throw the saddle on to  the pony, and make your way out of the camp, at once. Pitch all the  other things into the tent, and close it. If you leave them here,  it will seem strange. Balloba has seen me at Poona, and it is  likely enough that, as he thinks it over, he will remember that it  was in a dress altogether different from this. Go at once to  Sufder. If you get there before me, tell him to mount at once, and  ride fast to meet me.\"    Two minutes later, everything was prepared; and Wasil, mounting the  pony, rode off, while Harry moved away among the tents. In a quiet  spot, behind one of these, he threw off his upper garments and  stood in the ordinary undress of a Hindoo peasant, having nothing  on but a scanty loincloth. He had scarcely accomplished this when  he heard the trampling of horses; and saw, past the tent, four  troopers ride up to the spot he had just left.    \"Where is the trader who keeps this tent?\" one of them shouted. \"He  is a spy, and we have orders to arrest him.\"    Harry waited to hear no more, but walked in the opposite direction;  taking care to maintain a leisurely stride, and to avoid all  appearance of haste. Then, going down to the road by the side of  which the bazaar was encamped, he mingled with the crowd there.  Presently, one of the troopers dashed up.    \"Has anyone seen a man in the dress of a trader?\" and he roughly  described the attire of which Harry had rid himself.    There was a general chorus of denial, from those standing round,  and the trooper again galloped on.    Harry continued his walk at a leisurely pace, stopping occasionally  to look at articles exposed for sale, until he reached the end of  the bazaar. Then he made across the country. Trumpets were blowing  now in the camp, and he had no doubt that Balloba had ordered a  thorough search to be made for him. He did not quicken his pace,  however, until well out of sight; but then he broke into a swinging  trot, for he guessed that, when he was not found in the camp,  parties of cavalry would start to scour the country. He had gone  some four miles when, looking behind him, he saw about twenty  horsemen, far back along the road.    The country here was flat and open, with fields irrigated by canals  running from the Moola, and affording no opportunity for  concealment. Hitherto he had been running well within his powers;  but he now quickened his pace, and ran at full speed. He calculated  that Wasil would have at least half an hour's start of him; and  that, as he would urge the pony to the top of his speed, he would  by this time have joined Sufder; and he was sure that the latter  would not lose an instant before starting to meet him. He had  hesitated, for a moment, whether he should break into a quiet walk  and allow the troopers to overtake him, relying upon the alteration  of his costume; but he reflected that Balloba might have foreseen  that he would change his disguise, and have ordered the arrest of a  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20730"],[0,"For the Sake of the School (#12)"],[1,"ling, I really mean it; so will you write straight off to  Miss Bowes before I have time to turn thoroughly horrid again?        \"Your very loving daughter,              \"ULYTH.\"    Having sent off the letter, and thus burnt her boats, Ulyth accepted the  situation with what equanimity she could muster. Mrs. Stanton's  invitation arrived by return of post, and was accepted with great relief  by Miss Bowes, who had been wondering how to dispose of her pupil during  the holidays. The Cuckoo received the news with such pathetic glee that  Ulyth's heart smote her for not feeling more joyful herself.    \"Are you sure you want me?\" asked Rona wistfully.    \"Of course we do, or we wouldn't ask you,\" replied Ulyth, hoping her fib  might be forgiven.    \"I'll try and not disgrace you,\" volunteered the Cuckoo.    A few days before the end of the term Rona received a letter from New  Zealand. She rushed to Ulyth, waving it triumphantly.    \"Dad's sent me this,\" she announced, showing a very handsome cheque. \"I  wrote to him three days after I got here, and told him my clothes looked  rubbishy beside the other girls', and he tells me to rig myself out  afresh. I suppose he forgot about it till now. How'm I going to get the  things? There isn't time to ask Miss Bowes to send for them before the  holidays. Can I buy them at the place where you live?\"    \"Very well indeed, and Mother will help you to choose. I know she'll get  you lovely clothes; she has such exquisite taste! She'll just enjoy it.\"    \"And shan't I just? I'll give away every rag I brought with me from New  Zealand. They'll come in for that rummage sale Teddie was telling us  about.\"    The last lesson was finished, the last exercise written, even the last  breakfast had been disposed of. The boxes, packed with great excitement  the day before, were already dispatched, and four railway omnibuses were  waiting to take the girls to Llangarmon Junction Station. Much to their  regret, Miss Bowes would not allow them to go by Glanafon--the  picturesque route by the ferry was reserved for summer weather. In  winter, if the day happened to be stormy and the tide full, there was  often great difficulty in crossing, the landing-place was muddy and  slippery, and even if the train was not missed altogether (as sometimes  happened) the small voyage was quite in the nature of an adventure.    Miss Bowes' wisdom was thoroughly justified on this particular morning,  for there was a strong west wind, and the rain was pouring in torrents.    \"It would have been lovely fun in the flat. There must be big waves on  the river,\" declared Merle Denham, half aggrieved at missing such an  interesting opportunity.    \"Why, but look at the rain! You couldn't hold up an umbrella for half a  second. It would be blown inside out directly. You'd be as drenched as a  drowned rat before you reached the train,\" preached her more prudent  sister.    \"And suppose you were blown off the stepping-stones into the river!\"  added Beth Broadway. \"It would be a nice way of beginning the holidays!  No. On a morning like this I'd rather have the omnibus. We shall at  least start dry.\"    \"I'm so glad you're taking Rona home with you,\" whispered Lizzie  Lonsdale to Ulyth. \"I should have asked her myself if you hadn't. It  would have been a wretched Christmas for her to be left at school. I  never saw anyone so pleased!\"    The Cuckoo was indeed looking radiant at the golden prospect in store  for her. Much to her surprise, everybody had been particularly nice to  her that morning. Several girls had given her their addresses and asked  her to write to them, Miss Bowes had been kindness itself, and even Miss  Teddington, whose conduct was generally of a Spartan order, when bidding  her good-bye in the study, had actually bestowed an abrupt peck of a  kiss, a mark of favour never before known in the annals of the school.  To be sure, she had followed it with a warning against relapsing into  loud laughter in other people's houses; but then she was Miss  Teddington!    Ulyth lived in Staffordshire, and the journey from North Wales was  tedious; but what schoolgirl minds a long journey? To Rona all was new  and delightful, and to Ulyth every telegraph-post meant that she was so  much nearer home. The travellers had a royal reception, and kind,  tactful Mrs. Stanton managed at once to put her young guest at ease, and  make her feel that she was a welcome addition to the family circle.  Oswald, Ulyth's elder brother, had come from Harrow only an hour before,  and Dorothy and Peter, the two younger children, were prancing about in  utmost enthusiasm at the exciting arrivals.    \"Father hasn't come in yet?\" asked Ulyth, when she had finished hugging  her mother. \"Well, it will be all the bigger treat when he does. Oh,  Oswald, I didn't think you could grow so much in a term! Dorothy,  darling, don't quite choke me! Peterkin, come and shake hands with Rona.  Toby, do stop barking for half a moment! Where's Tabbyskins? And,  please, show me the new parrot. Oh, isn't it lovely to be at home  again!\"    Almost the whole of the next day was spent by Mrs. Stanton, Ulyth, and  their delighted visitor in a tour round various outfitting  establishments--an exhilarating time for Rona, who was making her first  acquaintance with the glories of English shops. Their purchases were  highly satisfactory, and as Ulyth helped her friend to dress for dinner  on Christmas Day she reviewed the result with the utmost complacency.    \"Didn't I tell you Mother has good taste? Rona, you're lovely! This  pale-blue dress suits you to a T. And the bronze slippers are so dainty;  and your hair is so pretty. You can't think how it has improved lately.\"    \"Do I look like other girls?\" asked Rona, fingering the enamelled locket  that had been given her that morning by Mr. and Mrs. Stanton.    \"Rather! A great deal nicer than most. I'm proud of you. I wish they  could all see you at The Woodlands.\"    \"I'm glad if I shan't disgrace you. What a good thing Dad's cheque came  just in time!\"    In her new plumage the Cuckoo appeared turned into a tropical  humming-bird. Ulyth had thought her good-looking before, but she had not  realized that her room-mate was a beauty. She stared almost fascinated  at the vision of blue eyes, coral cheeks, white neck, and ruddy-brown  hair. Was this indeed the same girl who had arrived at school last  September? It was like a transformation scene in the pantomime. Clothes  undoubtedly exercise a great effect on some people, and Rona seemed to  put away her backwoods manners with her up-country dresses. There was a  dignity about her now and a desire to please which she had never shown  at The Woodlands. She held herself straight, walked gracefully instead  of shambling, and was careful to allow no uncouth expressions to escape  her. Her behaviour was very quiet, as if she were watching others, or  taking mental stock of how to comport herself. If occasionally she made  some slight mistake she flushed crimson, but she never repeated it. She  was learning the whole time, and the least gentle hint from Mrs. Stanton  was sufficient for her. Miss Teddington need not have been afraid that  the loud laugh would offend the ears of her friends; it never rang out  once, and the high-pitched voice was subdued to wonderfully softened  tones. For her hostess Rona evinced a species of worship. She would  follow her about the house, content simply to be near her, and her face  would light up at the slightest word addressed to her.    \"The poor child just wanted a good mothering,\" said Mrs. Stanton to  Ulyth. \"It is marvellous how fast she is improving. You'll make  something of your little wild bird after all. She's worth the trouble.\"    \"I'd no idea she could grow into this,\" replied Ulyth. \"Oh, Motherkins,  you should have seen her at first! She was a very rough diamond.\"    \"Aren't you glad to have a hand in the polishing? It will be such a  triumph.\"    Two members of the household, at any rate, saw no fault in the visitor.  Dorothy and Peter haunted her like small persistent ghosts, begging for  stories about New Zealand. The accounts of her life in the bush were  like a romance to them, and so fired their enthusiasm that in the  intervals of playing soldiers they tried to emulate her adventures, and  were found with a clothes-line in the garden making a wild attempt to  lasso the much-enduring Toby.    \"Rona's very good-natured with them,\" said Ulyth. \"She doesn't mind how  they pull her about, and Peter's most exhausting sometimes. I shouldn't  like to carry him round the house on my back. Dorothy's perfectly  insatiable for stories; it's always 'Tell us another!' How funny Oswald  is at present. He's grown so outrageously polite all of a sudden. I  suppose it's because he's in the Sixth now. He was very different last  holidays. He's getting quite a 'lady's man'.\"    \"The young folks are growing up very fast,\" commented Mr. Stanton in  private. \"It seems only yesterday that Oswald and Ulyth were babies. In  another year or two we shall begin to think of twenty-first-birthday  dances.\"    \"Oh, don't talk of anything so dreadful!\" said Mrs. Stanton in  consternation. \"They're my babies still. The party on Thursday is to be  quite a children's affair.\"    Though \"Motherkins\" might regard the coming festivity as entirely of a  juvenile character, the young people took it seriously. They practised  dancing on the polished linoleum of the nursery every evening. Rona had  had her first lessons at The Woodlands, and was making heroic efforts to  remember what she had learnt.    \"You'll get on all right,\" Ulyth encouraged her. \"That last was ever so  much better; you're dropping into it quite nicely. You dance lightly,  at any rate. Now try again with Oswald while I play. Ossie, I'm proud of  you! Last Christmas you were a perfect duffer at it. Don't you remember  how you sat out at the Warings'? You've improved immensely."]]]
