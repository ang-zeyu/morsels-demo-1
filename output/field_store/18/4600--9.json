Its most characteristic property is the ease with which  it decomposes into water and oxygen. One part by weight of hydrogen is  capable of holding firmly only 7.94 parts of oxygen. The additional 7.94  parts of oxygen present in hydrogen dioxide are therefore easily  evolved, the compound breaking down into water and oxygen. This  decomposition is attended by the generation of considerable heat. In  dilute solution hydrogen dioxide is fairly stable, although such a  solution should be kept in a dark, cool place, since both heat and light  aid in the decomposition of the dioxide.    ~Uses.~ Solutions of hydrogen dioxide are used largely as oxidizing  agents. The solution sold by druggists contains 3% of the dioxide and is  used in medicine as an antiseptic. Its use as an antiseptic depends upon  its oxidizing properties.      EXERCISES    1.

CHAPTER V    THE ATOMIC THEORY      ~Three fundamental laws of matter.~ Before we can gain any very definite  idea in regard to the structure of matter, and the way in which  different kinds of substances act chemically upon each other, it is  necessary to have clearly in view three fundamental laws of matter.  These laws have been established by experiment, and any conception which  may be formed concerning matter must therefore be in harmony with them.  The laws are as follows:    ~Law of conservation of matter.~ This law has already been touched upon in  the introductory chapter, and needs no further discussion. It will be  recalled that it may be stated thus: _Matter can neither be created nor  destroyed, though it can be changed from one form into another._    ~Law of definite composition.~ In the earlier days of chemistry there was  much discussion as to whether the composition of a given compound is  always precisely the same or whether it is subject to some variation.  Two Frenchmen, Berthollet and Proust, were the leaders in this  discussion, and a great deal of most useful experimenting was done to  decide the question. Their experiments, as well as all succeeding ones,  have shown that the composition of a pure chemical compound is always  exactly the same. Water obtained by melting pure ice, condensing steam,  burning hydrogen in oxygen, has always 11.18% hydrogen and 88.82% oxygen  in it. Red oxide of mercury, from whatever source it is obtained,  contains 92.6% mercury and 7.4% oxygen. This truth is known as _the law  of definite composition_, and may be stated thus: _The composition of a  chemical compound never varies._    ~Law of multiple proportion.~ It has already been noted, however, that  hydrogen and oxygen combine in two different ratios to form water and  hydrogen dioxide respectively. It will be observed that this fact does  not contradict the law of definite composition, for entirely different  substances are formed. These compounds differ from each other in  composition, but the composition of each one is always constant. This  ability of two elements to unite in more than one ratio is very  frequently observed. Carbon and oxygen combine in two different ratios;  nitrogen and oxygen combine to form as many as five distinct compounds,  each with its own precise composition.    In the first decade of the last century John Dalton, an English  school-teacher and philosopher, endeavored to find some rule which holds  between the ratios in which two given substances combine. His studies  brought to light a very simple relation, which the following examples  will make clear. In water the hydrogen and oxygen are combined in the  ratio of 1 part by weight of hydrogen to 7.94 parts by weight of oxygen.  In hydrogen dioxide the 1 part by weight of hydrogen is combined with  15.88 parts by weight of oxygen. The ratio between the amounts of oxygen  which combine with the same amount of hydrogen to form water and  hydrogen dioxide respectively is therefore 7.94: 15.88, or 1: 2.    [Illustration: JOHN DALTON (English) (1766-1844)    Developed the atomic theory; made many studies on the properties and the  composition of gases. His book entitled \"A New System of Chemical  Philosophy\" had a large influence on the development of chemistry]    Similarly, the element iron combines with oxygen to form two oxides, one  of which is black and the other red. By analysis it has been shown that  the former contains 1 part by weight of iron combined with 0.286 parts  by weight of oxygen, while the latter contains 1 part by weight of iron  combined with 0.429 parts by weight of oxygen. Here again we find that  the amounts of oxygen which combine with the same fixed amount of iron  to form the two compounds are in the ratio of small whole numbers, viz.,  2:3.    Many other examples of this simple relation might be given, since it has  been found to hold true in all cases where more than one compound is,  formed from the same elements. Dalton's law of multiple proportion  states these facts as follows: _When any two elements,_ A _and_ B,  _combine to form more than one compound, the amounts of_ B _which unite  with any fixed amount of_ A _bear the ratio of small whole numbers to  each other_.    ~Hypothesis necessary to explain the laws of matter.~ These three  generalizations are called _laws_, because they express in concise  language truths which are found by careful experiment to hold good in  all cases. They do not offer any explanation of the facts, but merely  state them. The human mind, however, does not rest content with the mere  bare facts, but seeks ever to learn the explanation of the facts. A  suggestion which is offered to explain such a set of facts is called an  _hypothesis_. The suggestion which Dalton offered to explain the three  laws of matter, called the _atomic hypothesis_, was prompted by his view  of the constitution of matter, and it involves three distinct  assumptions in regard to the nature of matter and chemical action.  Dalton could not prove these assumptions to be true, but he saw that if  they were true the laws of matter become very easy to understand.    ~Dalton's atomic hypothesis.~ The three assumptions which Dalton made in  regard to the nature of matter, and which together constitute the atomic  hypothesis, are these:    1. All elements are made up of minute, independent particles which  Dalton designated as _atoms_.    2. All atoms of the same element have equal masses; those of different  elements have different masses; in any change to which an atom is  subjected its mass does not change.    3. When two or more elements unite to form a compound, the action  consists in the union of a definite small number of atoms of each  element to form a small particle of the compound. The smallest particles  of a given compound are therefore exactly alike in the number and kinds  of atoms which they contain, and larger masses of the substances are  simply aggregations of these least particles.    ~Molecules and atoms.~ Dalton applied the name atom not only to the minute  particles of the elements but also to the least particles of compounds.  Later Avogadro, an Italian scientist, pointed out the fact that the two  are different, since the smallest particle of an element is a unit,  while that of a compound must have at least two units in it. He  suggested the name _molecule_ for the least particle of a compound which  can exist, retaining the name _atom_ for the smallest particle of an  element. In accordance with this distinction, we may define the atom and  the molecule as follows: _An atom is the smallest particle of an element  which can exist. A molecule is the smallest particle of a compound which  can exist._ It will be shown in a subsequent chapter that sometimes two  or more atoms of the same element unite with each other to form  molecules of the element. While the term atom, therefore, is applicable  only to elements, the term molecule is applicable both to elements and  compounds.    ~The atomic hypothesis and the laws of matter.~ Supposing the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20851"],[0,"Character Sketches of Romance, Fiction and the Drama, Vol. 3 (#12)"],[1,"      matter.
