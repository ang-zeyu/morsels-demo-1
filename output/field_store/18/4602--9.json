If any modern man were  put back in the Becket quarrel, his sympathies would certainly be torn  in two; for if the King's scheme was the more rational, the Archbishop's  was the more humane. And despite the horrors that darkened religious  disputes long afterwards, this character was certainly in the bulk the  historic character of Church government. It is admitted, for instance,  that things like eviction, or the harsh treatment of tenants, was  practically unknown wherever the Church was landlord. The principle  lingered into more evil days in the form by which the Church authorities  handed over culprits to the secular arm to be killed, even for religious  offences. In modern romances this is treated as a mere hypocrisy; but  the man who treats every human inconsistency as a hypocrisy is himself a  hypocrite about his own inconsistencies.    Our world, then, cannot understand St. Thomas, any more than St.  Francis, without accepting very simply a flaming and even fantastic  charity, by which the great Archbishop undoubtedly stands for the  victims of this world, where the wheel of fortune grinds the faces of  the poor. He may well have been too idealistic; he wished to protect the  Church as a sort of earthly paradise, of which the rules might seem to  him as paternal as those of heaven, but might well seem to the King as  capricious as those of fairyland. But if the priest was too idealistic,  the King was really too practical; it is intrinsically true to say he  was too practical to succeed in practice. There re-enters here, and  runs, I think, through all English history, the rather indescribable  truth I have suggested about the Conqueror; that perhaps he was hardly  impersonal enough for a pure despot. The real moral of our mediaeval  story is, I think, subtly contrary to Carlyle's vision of a stormy  strong man to hammer and weld the state like a smith. Our strong men  were too strong for us, and too strong for themselves. They were too  strong for their own aim of a just and equal monarchy. The smith broke  upon the anvil the sword of state that he was hammering for himself.  Whether or no this will serve as a key to the very complicated story of  our kings and barons, it is the exact posture of Henry II. to his rival.  He became lawless out of sheer love of law. He also stood, though in a  colder and more remote manner, for the whole people against feudal  oppression; and if his policy had succeeded in its purity, it would at  least have made impossible the privilege and capitalism of later times.  But that bodily restlessness which stamped and spurned the furniture was  a symbol of him; it was some such thing that prevented him and his heirs  from sitting as quietly on their throne as the heirs of St. Louis. He  thrust again and again at the tough intangibility of the priests'  Utopianism like a man fighting a ghost; he answered transcendental  defiances with baser material persecutions; and at last, on a dark and,  I think, decisive day in English history, his word sent four feudal  murderers into the cloisters of Canterbury, who went there to destroy a  traitor and who created a saint.    At the grave of the dead man broke forth what can only be called an  epidemic of healing. For miracles so narrated there is the same evidence  as for half the facts of history; and any one denying them must deny  them upon a dogma. But something followed which would seem to modern  civilization even more monstrous than a miracle. If the reader can  imagine Mr. Cecil Rhodes submitting to be horsewhipped by a Boer in St.  Paul's Cathedral, as an apology for some indefensible death incidental  to the Jameson Raid, he will form but a faint idea of what was meant  when Henry II. was beaten by monks at the tomb of his vassal and enemy.  The modern parallel called up is comic, but the truth is that mediaeval  actualities have a violence that does seem comic to our conventions. The  Catholics of that age were driven by two dominant thoughts: the  all-importance of penitence as an answer to sin, and the all-importance  of vivid and evident external acts as a proof of penitence. Extravagant  humiliation after extravagant pride for them restored the balance of  sanity. The point is worth stressing, because without it moderns make  neither head nor tail of the period. Green gravely suggests, for  instance, of Henry's ancestor Fulk of Anjou, that his tyrannies and  frauds were further blackened by \"low superstition,\" which led him to be  dragged in a halter round a shrine, scourged and screaming for the mercy  of God. Mediaevals would simply have said that such a man might well  scream for it, but his scream was the only logical comment he could  make. But they would have quite refused to see why the scream should be  added to the sins and not subtracted from them. They would have thought  it simply muddle-headed to have the same horror at a man for being  horribly sinful and for being horribly sorry.    But it may be suggested, I think, though with the doubt proper to  ignorance, that the Angevin ideal of the King's justice lost more by the  death of St. Thomas than was instantly apparent in the horror of  Christendom, the canonization of the victim and the public penance of  the tyrant. These things indeed were in a sense temporary; the King  recovered the power to judge clerics, and many later kings and  justiciars continued the monarchical plan. But I would suggest, as a  possible clue to puzzling after events, that here and by this murderous  stroke the crown lost what should have been the silent and massive  support of its whole policy. I mean that it lost the people.    It need not be repeated that the case for despotism is democratic. As a  rule its cruelty to the strong is kindness to the weak. An autocrat  cannot be judged as a historical character by his relations with other  historical characters. His true applause comes not from the few actors  on the lighted stage of aristocracy, but from that enormous audience  which must always sit in darkness throughout the drama. The king who  helps numberless helps nameless men, and when he flings his widest  largesse he is a Christian doing good by stealth. This sort of monarchy  was certainly a mediaeval ideal, nor need it necessarily fail as a  reality. French kings were never so merciful to the people as when they  were merciless to the peers; and it is probably true that a Czar who was  a great lord to his intimates was often a little father in innumerable  little homes. It is overwhelmingly probable that such a central power,  though it might at last have deserved destruction in England as in  France, would in England as in France have prevented the few from  seizing and holding all the wealth and power to this day. But in England  it broke off short, through something of which the slaying of St. Thomas  may well have been the supreme example. It was something overstrained  and startling and against the instincts of the people. And of what was  meant in the Middle Ages by that very powerful and rather peculiar  thing, the people, I shall speak in the next chapter.    In any case this conjecture finds support in the ensuing events. It is  not merely that, just as the great but personal plan of the Conqueror  collapsed after all into the chaos of the Stephen transition, so the  great but personal plan of the first Plantagenet collapsed into the  chaos of the Barons' Wars. When all allowance is made for constitutional  fictions and afterthoughts, it does seem likely that here for the first  time some moral strength deserted the monarchy. The character of Henry's  second son John (for Richard belongs rather to the last chapter) stamped  it with something accidental and yet symbolic. It was not that John was  a mere black blot on the pure gold of the Plantagenets, the texture was  much more mixed and continuous; but he really was a discredited  Plantagenet, and as it were a damaged Plantagenet. It was not that he  was much more of a bad man than many opposed to him, but he was the  kind of bad man whom bad men and good do combine to oppose. In a sense  subtler than that of the legal and parliamentary logic-chopping invented  long afterwards, he certainly managed to put the Crown in the wrong.  Nobody suggested that the barons of Stephen's time starved men in  dungeons to promote political liberty, or hung them up by the heels as a  symbolic request for a free parliament. In the reign of John and his son  it was still the barons, and not in the least the people, who seized the  power; but there did begin to appear a _case_ for their seizing it, for  contemporaries as well as constitutional historians afterwards. John, in  one of his diplomatic doublings, had put England into the papal care, as  an estate is put in Chancery. And unluckily the Pope, whose counsels had  generally been mild and liberal, was then in his death-grapple with the  Germanic Emperor and wanted every penny he could get to win. His winning  was a blessing to Europe, but a curse to England, for he used the island  as a mere treasury for this foreign war. In this and other matters the  baronial party began to have something like a principle, which is the  backbone of a policy. Much conventional history that connects their  councils with a thing like our House of Commons is as far-fetched as it  would be to say that the Speaker wields a Mace like those which the  barons brandished in battle. Simon de Montfort was not an enthusiast for  the Whig theory of the British Constitution, but he was an enthusiast  for something. He founded a parliament in a fit of considerable absence  of mind; but it was with true presence of mind, in the responsible and  even religious sense which had made his father so savage a Crusader  against heretics, that he laid about him with his great sword before he  fell at Evesham.

Oh, how I looked at her now! \"And did you see anyone?\"    \"Ah, NO!\" she returned, almost with the full privilege of childish  inconsequence, resentfully, though with a long sweetness in her little  drawl of the negative.    At that moment, in the state of my nerves, I absolutely believed she  lied; and if I once more closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of the  three or four possible ways in which I might take this up. One of these,  for a moment, tempted me with such singular intensity that, to withstand  it, I must have gripped my little girl with a spasm that, wonderfully,  she submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright. Why not break out  at her on the spot and have it all over?--give it to her straight in her  lovely little lighted face? \"You see, you see, you KNOW that you do and  that you already quite suspect I believe it; therefore, why not frankly  confess it to me, so that we may at least live with it together and  learn perhaps, in the strangeness of our fate, where we are and what  it means?\" This solicitation dropped, alas, as it came: if I could  immediately have succumbed to it I might have spared myself--well,  you'll see what. Instead of succumbing I sprang again to my feet,  looked at her bed, and took a helpless middle way. \"Why did you pull the  curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?\"    Flora luminously considered; after which, with her little divine smile:  \"Because I don't like to frighten you!\"    \"But if I had, by your idea, gone out--?\"    She absolutely declined to be puzzled; she turned her eyes to the flame  of the candle as if the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as  impersonal, as Mrs. Marcet or nine-times-nine. \"Oh, but you know,\" she  quite adequately answered, \"that you might come back, you dear, and that  you HAVE!\" And after a little, when she had got into bed, I had, for a  long time, by almost sitting on her to hold her hand, to prove that I  recognized the pertinence of my return.    You may imagine the general complexion, from that moment, of my nights.  I repeatedly sat up till I didn't know when; I selected moments when my  roommate unmistakably slept, and, stealing out, took noiseless turns in  the passage and even pushed as far as to where I had last met Quint. But  I never met him there again; and I may as well say at once that I on no  other occasion saw him in the house. I just missed, on the staircase,  on the other hand, a different adventure. Looking down it from the top I  once recognized the presence of a woman seated on one of the lower steps  with her back presented to me, her body half-bowed and her head, in an  attitude of woe, in her hands. I had been there but an instant, however,  when she vanished without looking round at me. I knew, nonetheless,  exactly what dreadful face she had to show; and I wondered whether, if  instead of being above I had been below, I should have had, for going  up, the same nerve I had lately shown Quint. Well, there continued to  be plenty of chance for nerve. On the eleventh night after my latest  encounter with that gentleman--they were all numbered now--I had an  alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed, from the particular  quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my sharpest shock. It was  precisely the first night during this series that, weary with watching,  I had felt that I might again without laxity lay myself down at my  old hour. I slept immediately and, as I afterward knew, till about one  o'clock; but when I woke it was to sit straight up, as completely roused  as if a hand had shook me. I had left a light burning, but it was now  out, and I felt an instant certainty that Flora had extinguished it.  This brought me to my feet and straight, in the darkness, to her bed,  which I found she had left. A glance at the window enlightened me  further, and the striking of a match completed the picture.    The child had again got up--this time blowing out the taper, and had  again, for some purpose of observation or response, squeezed in behind  the blind and was peering out into the night. That she now saw--as she  had not, I had satisfied myself, the previous time--was proved to me by  the fact that she was disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the  haste I made to get into slippers and into a wrap. Hidden, protected,  absorbed, she evidently rested on the sill--the casement opened  forward--and gave herself up. There was a great still moon to help her,  and this fact had counted in my quick decision. She was face to face  with the apparition we had met at the lake, and could now communicate  with it as she had not then been able to do. What I, on my side, had to  care for was, without disturbing her, to reach, from the corridor, some  other window in the same quarter. I got to the door without her hearing  me; I got out of it, closed it, and listened, from the other side, for  some sound from her. While I stood in the passage I had my eyes on her  brother's door, which was but ten steps off and which, indescribably,  produced in me a renewal of the strange impulse that I lately spoke  of as my temptation. What if I should go straight in and march to HIS  window?--what if, by risking to his boyish bewilderment a revelation of  my motive, I should throw across the rest of the mystery the long halter  of my boldness?    This thought held me sufficiently to make me cross to his threshold and  pause again. I preternaturally listened; I figured to myself what might  portentously be; I wondered if his bed were also empty and he too were  secretly at watch. It was a deep, soundless minute, at the end of which  my impulse failed. He was quiet; he might be innocent; the risk was  hideous; I turned away. There was a figure in the grounds--a figure  prowling for a sight, the visitor with whom Flora was engaged; but it  was not the visitor most concerned with my boy. I hesitated afresh, but  on other grounds and only for a few seconds; then I had made my choice.  There were empty rooms at Bly, and it was only a question of choosing  the right one. The right one suddenly presented itself to me as the  lower one--though high above the gardens--in the solid corner of the  house that I have spoken of as the old tower. This was a large, square  chamber, arranged with some state as a bedroom, the extravagant size of  which made it so inconvenient that it had not for years, though kept by  Mrs. Grose in exemplary order, been occupied. I had often admired it and  I knew my way about in it; I had only, after just faltering at the first  chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across it and unbolt as quietly as I  could one of the shutters. Achieving this transit, I uncovered the  glass without a sound and, applying my face to the pane, was able, the  darkness without being much less than within, to see that I commanded  the right direction. Then I saw something more. The moon made the  night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the lawn a person,  diminished by distance, who stood there motionless and as if fascinated,  looking up to where I had appeared--looking, that is, not so much  straight at me as at something that was apparently above me. There was  clearly another person above me--there was a person on the tower; but  the presence on the lawn was not in the least what I had conceived and  had confidently hurried to meet. The presence on the lawn--I felt sick  as I made it out--was poor little Miles himself.          XI      It was not till late next day that I spoke to Mrs. Grose; the rigor with  which I kept my pupils in sight making it often difficult to meet  her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance of not  provoking--on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the  children--any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of  mysteries. I drew a great security in this particular from her mere  smooth aspect. There was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others  my horrible confidences. She believed me, I was sure, absolutely: if she  hadn't I don't know what would have become of me, for I couldn't have  borne the business alone. But she was a magnificent monument to the  blessing of a want of imagination, and if she could see in our little  charges nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness and  cleverness, she had no direct communication with the sources of my  trouble. If they had been at all visibly blighted or battered, she would  doubtless have grown, on tracing it back, haggard enough to match them;  as matters stood, however, I could feel her, when she surveyed them,  with her large white arms folded and the habit of serenity in all her  look, thank the Lord's mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would  still serve. Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, to a steady  fireside glow, and I had already begun to perceive how, with the  development of the conviction that--as time went on without a public  accident--our young things could, after all, look out for themselves,  she addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their  instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I could  engage that, to the world, my face should tell no tales, but it would  have been, in the conditions, an immense added strain to find myself  anxious about hers.    At the hour I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the  terrace, where, with the lapse of the season, the afternoon sun was now  agreeable; and we sat there together while, before us, at a distance,  but within call if we wished, the children strolled to and fro in one  of their most manageable moods.
