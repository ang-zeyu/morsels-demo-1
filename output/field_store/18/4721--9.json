The standing wall of _z_ is not continuous with that of the  next room, _y_, and apparently was simply the rear of a large room  with the remains of a lateral wall at right angles to it. The other  walls of this chamber had tumbled into a deep gorge, overgrown with  bushes which conceal the fragments. This building is set back deeply  in the cave, and is isolated from the remaining parts of the ruin,  although at the level which may have been its roof there runs a kind  of gallery formed by a ledge of rock, plastered with adobe, which  formerly connected the roof with the rest of the pueblo. This ledge  was a means of intercommunication, and a continuation of the same  ledge, in rooms _s_, _t_, and _u_, supported the rafters of these  chambers. At _u_ there are evidences of two stories or two tiers of  rooms, but those in front have fallen to the ground.    The standing wall at _u_ is about five feet high, connected with the  face of the cliff by masonry. The space between it and the cliff was  not large enough for a habitable chamber, and was used probably as a  storage place. In front of the standing wall of room _u_ there was  another chamber, the walls of which now strew the talus of the cliff.    The highest and best preserved room of the second series of chambers  at Honanki is that designated _p_, at a point where the ruin reached  an elevation of 20 feet. Here we have good evidence of rooms of two  stories, as indicated by the points of insertion of the beams of a  floor, at the usual levels above the ground. In fact, it is probable  that the whole section of the ruin was two stories high throughout,  the front walls having fallen along the entire length. From the last  room on the left to the eastern extremity of the line of houses which  leads to the main ruin of Honanki, no ground plans were detected at  the base of the cliffs, but fallen rocks and scattered debris are  strewn over the whole interval.    The eastern part of the main ruin of Honanki, however, lies but a  short distance west of that described, and consists of many similar  chambers, arranged side by side. These are lettered in the diagram _h_  to _u_, beginning with _h_, which is irregularly circular in form, and  ends with a high wall, the first to be seen as one approaches the ruin  from Lloyd canyon. This range of houses is situated on a lower  foundation and at a lower level than that of the main quarter of  Honanki, and a trail runs along so close to the rooms that the whole  series is easily visited without much climbing. No woodwork remains in  any of these rooms, and the masonry is badly broken in places either  by natural agencies or through vandalism.    Beginning with _h_, the round room, which adjoins the main quarter of  Honanki, we find much in its shape to remind us of a kiva. The walls  are in part built on foundations of large bowlders, one of which  formed the greater part of the front wall. This circular room was  found to be full of fallen debris, and could not be examined without  considerable excavation. If it were a kiva, which I very much doubt,  it is an exception among the Verde valley ruins, where no true kiva  has yet been detected.[27]    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. CI    FRONT WALL OF PALATKI (RUIN II)]    Following _h_ there is an inclosure which originally may have been a  habitable room, as indicated by the well-constructed front wall, but  it is so filled with large stones that it is difficult to examine its  interior. On one side the wall, which is at right angles to the face  of the cliff, is 10 feet high, and the front wall follows the surface  of a huge bowlder which serves as its foundation.    Room _i_ is clearly defined, and is in part inclosed by a large rock,  on top of which there still remains a fragment of a portion of the  front wall. A spur of masonry connects this bowlder with the face of  the cliff, indicating all that remains of the former division between  rooms _i_ and _j_. An offshoot from this bowlder, in the form of a  wall 10 feet high, formerly inclosed one side of a room. In the rear  of chamber _j_ there are found two receptacles or spaces left between  the rear wall and the face of the cliff, while the remaining wall,  which is 10 feet high, is a good specimen of pueblo masonry.    The two side walls of room _k_ are well preserved, but the chamber  resembles the others of the series in the absence of a front wall. In  this room, however, there remains what may have been the fragment of a  rear wall parallel with the face of the cliff. This room has also a  small cist of masonry in one corner, which calls to mind certain  sealed cavities in the cavate dwellings.    The two side walls of _m_ and _n_ are respectively eight and ten feet  high. There is nothing exceptional in the standing walls of room _o_,  one of which, five feet in altitude, still remains erect. Room _p_ has  a remnant of a rear wall plastered to the face of the cliff.    Room _r_ (plate CIII) is a finely preserved chamber, with lateral  walls 20 feet high, of well-constructed masonry, that in the rear,  through which there is an opening leading into a dark chamber,  occupying the space between it and the cliff. It is braced by  connecting walls at right angles to the face of the solid rock.    At _s_, the face of the cliff forms a rear wall of the room, and one  of the side walls is fully 20 feet high. The points of insertion of  the flooring are well shown, about 10 feet from the ground, proving  that the ruin at this point was at least two stories high.    Two walled inclosures, one within the other, characterize room _u_. On  the cliff above it there is a series of simple pictographs, consisting  of short parallel lines pecked into the rock, and are probably of  Apache origin. This room closes the second series, along the whole  length of which, in front of the lateral walls which mark different  chambers, there are, at intervals, piles of debris, which enabled an  approximate determination of the situation of the former front wall,  fragments of the foundations of which are traceable in situ in several  places.    The hand of man and the erosion of the elements have dealt harshly  with this portion of Honanki, for not a fragment of timber now remains  in its walls. This destruction, so far as human agency is concerned,  could not have been due to white men, but probably to the Apache, or  possibly to the cliff villagers themselves at the time of or shortly  after the abandonment of the settlement.    From the second section of Honanki we pass to the third and  best-preserved portion of the ruins (figure 249), indicated in the  diagram from _a_ to _g_. To this section I have referred as the \"main  ruin,\" for it was evidently the most populous quarter of the ancient  cliff dwelling. It is better preserved than the remainder of Honanki,  and is the only part in which all four walls of the chambers still  remain erect. Built at a higher level than the series of rooms already  considered, it must have towered above them, and possibly served as a  place of retreat when danger beset the more exposed quarters of the  village.    [Illustration: FIG. 249--The main ruin of Honanki]    Approaching the main ruin of Honanki (plate CIV) from the east, or  the parts already described, one passes between the buttress on which  the front wall of the rounded room _h_ is built and a fragment of  masonry on the left, by a natural gateway through which the trail is  very steep. On the right there towers above the visitor a  well-preserved wall of masonry, the front of room _a_, and he soon  passes abreast of the main portion of the ruin of Honanki. This  section is built in a huge cavern, the overhanging roof of which, is  formed by natural rock, arching far above the tops of the highest  walls of the pueblo and suggesting the surroundings of the \"Cliff  Palace\" of Mesa Verde, so well described by the late Baron G.  Nordenskioeld in his valuable monograph on the ruins of that section of  southern Colorado. The main ruin of Honanki is one of the largest and  best preserved architectural monuments of the former people of Verde  valley that has yet been described. Although somewhat resembling its  rival, the well-known \"Casa Montezuma\" of Beaver creek, its  architecture is dissimilar on account of the difference in the form of  the cavern in which it is built and the geological character of the  surrounding cliffs. Other Verde ruins may have accommodated more  people, when inhabited, but none of its type south of Canyon de Chelly  have yet been described which excel it in size and condition of  preservation. I soon found that our party were not the first whites  who had seen this lonely village, as the names scribbled on its walls  attested; but so far as I know it had not previously been visited by  archeologists.    [Illustration: BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY    SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. CII    HONANKI (RUIN II)]    In the main portion of Honanki we found that the two ends of the  crescentic row of united rooms which compose it are built on rocky  elevations, with foundations considerably higher than those of the  rooms in the middle portion of the ruins. The line of the front wall  is, therefore, not exactly crescentic, but irregularly curved (figure  249), conforming to the rear of the cavern in which the houses are  situated. About midway in the curve of the front walls two walls  indicative of former rooms extend at an angle of about 25 deg. to the main  front wall. All the component rooms of the main part of Honanki can be  entered, some by external passageways, others by doorways  communicating with adjacent chambers. None of the inclosures have  roofs or upper floors, although indications of the former existence of  both these structural features may readily be seen in several"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23692"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 1 (of 8) (#12)"],[1,"him financially on his feet, which feet he  meant promptly to use for running away from his responsibilities.  Some declare that the policy of Sir T. Shepstone was premature, that  he should have waited until the Boer had soaked further in the  slough of insolvency into which he was fast sinking. But Sekukuni  was threatening, and on the south-eastern frontier Cetchwayo, with a  force some thirty thousand strong, was waiting his opportunity. The  promise of the future was a general holocaust, in which Boer men,  women, and children, farms and flocks would be annihilated. Sir T.  Shepstone, had he been other than a Briton, might have stayed his  hand and waited till the Boers were effectually swept away, but  being a Briton he acted as such, doubtless arguing that,        \"As we under Heaven are supreme head,      So, under him, that great supremacy,      Where we do reign, we will alone uphold.\"      THE WEB THICKENING    It must be remembered that between the Zulus and the Boers no  boundary line had ever been fixed, and that for over a dozen years  the Zulu chiefs had repeatedly implored the British Governor in  Natal for advice and help in their dealings with these aggressors.  It had been part of the Dutch policy--if policy it may be called--to  force the Zulu gradually to edge further and further from the rich  pasture lands sloping eastward of the Drakensberg Mountains, and  spreading to right and left into the north and west of Zululand.  Little notice had been taken of their petitions, and the Zulus had  determined to take the law into their own hands. Cetchwayo,  therefore, when the news of our annexation of the Transvaal reached  him, was like a wild beast baulked of its prey. He was anxious for  an occasion for his young warriors \"to wash their spears\" in the  gore of his enemies, and was naturally disappointed to find them  under the protection of the white man. The Natal Government  attempted to soothe him--to promote peace. He remained sullen and  simmered. He vented his spleen by putting several young women to  death for having refused to marry his soldiers. On being  remonstrated with by the Natal Government, he expressed himself with  engaging candour. His own words, without comment, describe the  character with which we had to deal.    \"Did I ever tell Mr. Shepstone,\" his Majesty cried, \"that I would  not kill? Did Mr. Shepstone tell the white people I made such an  arrangement? Because if he did he deceived them. I do kill; but I do  not consider that I have done anything yet in the way of killing.  Why do the white people start at nothing? I have not yet begun. I  have yet to kill. It is the custom of our nation, and I will not  depart from it. Why does the Governor of Natal speak to me about my  laws? I shall not agree to any laws or rules from Natal, and by so  doing throw the large kraal which I govern into the water. My people  will not listen unless they are killed, and while wishing to be  friends with the English I do not agree to give my people over to be  governed by laws sent to me by them. Have I not asked the English to  allow me to wash my spears since the death of my father, Upandi, and  they have kept playing with me all the time, treating me as a  child?\" ... A good deal more followed in this strain. Since his  accession the gallant Cetchwayo had decided to \"wash his spears\" in  the blood of his neighbours, and whatever the British might have to  say in the matter, wash them he would. It was obvious, therefore,  that a ruffian of this kind, backed by a bloodthirsty following, was  a permanent danger to our Colony of Natal and to its white  inhabitants. Something must be done to remove the disquiet caused by  the utterances of the savage. Sir Henry Bulwer (the Governor of  Natal)--to conciliate the king and to allay his fears lest his  territory, like that of the Boers, should be annexed--proposed that  a commission should investigate the rival claims of Boers and Zulus  on border questions, and settle them by arbitration. But what Sir H.  Bulwer proposed Sir Bartle Frere, High Commissioner in South Africa,  disapproved. He felt that Cetchwayo and his host would be a standing  menace to the borders of Natal. Nevertheless he agreed to a  discussion of the vexed boundary question between Boer and Zulu, in  which the commissioners declared unanimously against the claims of  the former. Certain land only to west of the Blood River, held by  the Boers and unchallenged by the Zulus, was confirmed to the Dutch  settlers in their occupation of the same. But to this decision Sir  Bartle Frere considered it expedient to add some saving clauses.  These demanded, first, that Cetchwayo should adhere to the  guarantees he had given and not permit indiscriminate shedding of  blood; second, that he should institute from his existing military  system the form of tribal quotas; third, that he should accept the  presence of a British Resident; fourth, that he should protect the  missionaries and their converts; and lastly, that he should  surrender certain criminals and pay certain fines. His Zulu Majesty  was given thirty days to consider the subject. Instead of  considering he flouted it. The result was war.      THE ZULU WAR    According to the opinion of Sir Bartle Frere there was, and for a  long time had been, a growing desire on the part of the great chiefs  to make this war into a simultaneous rising of Kaffirdom against  white civilisation. A spirit of mutiny had been in the air since the  terrible events in India in 1857, and there was a general conviction  among the native tribes that the authority of Great Britain would  eventually be overthrown. Now the most powerful of all the native  tribes in South Africa were the Zulus, whose military organisation  had long been celebrated, and who had earned a great reputation  since the days of Gaika, and more especially in the time that  followed when Chaka, who was a born warrior, brought the gigantic  army into a state of marvellous efficiency.    A few words regarding the career of this great chieftain may be  found interesting, for to him is accorded the credit of the  indubitably warlike and brave disposition of his countrymen. This  man, who has been at times called the Attila and the Napoleon of  South Africa, was born in 1783. He became chief officer to  Dingiswayo, a man of remarkable ability, who studied European  military systems and modelled on their principle a highly efficient  army. Chaka, heir to a chieftainship of the Amazulu tribe (the Zulus  proper), took the fancy of Dingiswayo, who elevated him first to a  post of high command, and eventually to the vacant Zulu  chieftainship. On the death in battle of Dingiswayo, Chaka assumed  the command of both tribes, to which he gave his name. The already  excellent army he proceeded to improve till it became one of the  most efficient military organisations ever originated in an  uncivilised country. The whole kingdom was ordered on a military  footing, and expanded so wondrously that the original two tribes at  first commanded by Chaka became an hundred, each tribe having been  defeated in warfare and incorporated in the Zulu nationality. His  policy, unlike that of Cetchwayo later on, was not to destroy but to  subdue, and thus he soon ruled with undisputed sway over a complete  empire covering the desolated regions of Natal, Zululand, and the  modern Boer States. His methods of military training were entirely  Spartan; his discipline was a discipline of iron. Disobedience was  met with the penalty of death. To tread out a roaring bush-fire, or  capture alive a wild beast, were some of the tasks imposed as daily  training for his would-be warriors. An order was an order, and this,  however dangerous or seemingly impossible, had to be obeyed by  individual or regiment on pain of the most horrible forms of death.  It may easily be imagined that this stern regime was calculated to  create a military following of the most brave and adventurous order.  Naturally enough, all the other Kaffir tribes looked to the Zulus as  their leaders and champions in the contest. Captain Hamilton Parr  tells a tale of an old Galeka warrior who said to a native  magistrate, \"Yes, you have beaten us--you have beaten us well; but  there,\" pointing eastward, \"there are the Amazulu warriors. Can you  beat them? They say not. Go and try. Don't trouble any more about  us, but go and beat _them_ and we shall be quiet enough.\" This  anecdote serves to describe the general sentiment of disdain for  British authority which Sir Bartle Frere detected almost immediately  after his arrival among the natives, and to account in a measure for  what has been declared to be his high-handed policy. He was  convinced that we could never expect peace among the chiefs until we  had satisfied them who was master. A lesson was necessary to show  that the British Government could govern and meant to govern, and  that lesson he felt must be taught sooner or later. For a long time  Cetchwayo had been instigating rebellion and preparing for war. As  may be seen from Lord Carnarvon's letter of the 24th of January 1878  to Sir Bartle Frere, the Government was fully conscious of the  existing necessity to protect the Transvaal and to maintain British  prestige in South Africa. The despatch runs: \"It seems certain that  the Zulu king has derived from his messengers the unfortunate idea  that the Kaffirs are able to cope with the Colony on more than equal  terms, and this belief has, as was inevitable, produced a very  threatening change in his language and conduct towards the Transvaal  Government. It is only too probable that a savage chief such as  Cetchwayo, supported by a powerful army already excited by the  recent successes of a neighbouring tribe over the late Government of  the Transvaal, may now become fired with the idea of victory over  her Majesty's forces, and that a deliberate attempt upon her  Majesty's"]]]
