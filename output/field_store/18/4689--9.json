[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22700"],[0,"Brittany & Its Byways (#12)"],[1,"St.  Yves, convinced that St. Yves will cause the faithless creditor to die  within the year. His truthfulness was such, he was called St. Yves de  Verite. He is the special patron of lawyers, and always represented in the  \"mortier,\" or lawyer's cap, with an ermine-trimmed scarlet robe.          \"Saint Yves etait Breton,      Avocat et pas larron,      Chose rare, se dit-on.\"      Lawyers, says a writer, take him for a patron, but not for a model. Philip  le Hardi, in acknowledgment of his worth, granted him a pension of six  deniers a day--in those times a considerable sum.    Over this house is a marble tablet with this inscription:--             \"Ici est ne le 17 Oct^r 1253, et est mort le 19 Mai 1303,                                   SAINT YVES,      Officiel de Treguier, cure de Tredretz et de Lohannec. Sa maison, qui a    subsiste jusqu'en l'annee 1834, ayant ete alors demolie a cause de    vetuste, Mg^r Hyacinthe Louis de Quelen, Arch^vque de Paris, et    proprietaire des domaines de Kermartin, a fait placer cette inscription,    afin qu'un lieu sanctifie par la presence d'un si grand serviteur de    Dieu ne demeurat pas inconnu (1837).\"    The house is a good specimen of a Breton dwelling; by the side of the  fire, in the one room of which most of these cottages consist, fixed  against the wall like the berth of a ship, stands the bedstead or \"lit  clos\" of old oak, shut in by carved and well-waxed sliding panels, often  inscribed with the sacred monogram.  The two mattresses, paillasse, and  \"cossette de plume,\" are piled up to such a height as barely to admit of  its tenants creeping into the bed. In front is the customary chest,  containing the family wardrobe, answering the double purpose of a seat and  the means of ascending into the bed. Often we have seen cupboards on each  side of the large chimney with two shelves, which served as beds for the  juvenile members of the family. Forms and a polished table complete the  furniture; the last has frequently little wells hollowed in the top, used,  instead of plates, to hold the soup. Over the table, suspended by pulleys,  are two indispensable articles in a Breton dwelling--a large circular  basket to cover the bread, and a kind of wooden frame or rack, round which  the spoons are ranged. Forks they do not use. Festoons of sausages, with  hams, bacon, candles, skins of lard, onions, horse-shoes, harness, all  hang suspended from the ceiling, which consists of fagots of hazel  suspended by cross-poles. The floor is of beaten earth. One narrow window  admits the light, and there are no outhouses. The manure-heap is generally  at the house-door, and the pigs and poultry seem on an equally intimate  footing as they are in our Irish cabins. The Breton's cottage has often no  garden, to occupy his leisure hours; and the men, after their daily work,  resort to the cabaret to spend their time and their earnings. Agriculture  is very backward in Brittany, but the land produces abundance of corn. It  is thrashed out direct from the field, on a clay floor (aire). Beet-root  and clover grow very luxuriantly, and in some fields the pretty red clover  (_Trifolium incarnatum_) carpets the country with its crimson flowers.    Near the farmhouse of Kermartin is the parish church of Minihy-Treguier,  formerly a chapel founded by St. Ives and attached to the \"manoir.\" The  will of St. Ives is framed and hung up in the church, and his breviary is  also preserved here; but the guide said it was now kept at the priest's  house, as people were in the habit of taking away a leaf as a relic.  Minihy, _i. e._ Monk's House, is a name given to those places which,  through the intercession of some saint, had the right of sanctuary. They  were marked with a red cross, and, how great soever the crime, were  regarded as inviolable. In 1441 the right of sanctuary was restricted to  churches; before, it was extended to towns and districts. Treguier had the  privilege within a radius of twelve miles from the town. St. Malo also  possessed the right of sanctuary. Treguier is one of the four bishoprics  that formed the ancient divisions of Brittany. The others were Leon,  Cornouaille, and Vannes. The \"pays de Treguier\" answers exactly to the  present department of the Cotes-du-Nord; Leon to the territory or  arrondissement of Brest and Morlaix; Cornouaille has Quimper and Carhaix  for its principal towns; and Vannes, the country of Celtic remains, is to  the south.    Treguier is prettily situated on a hill, at the confluence of the rivers  Jaudy and Guindy; its principal building is the beautiful, imposing  cathedral, with its elegant spire, begun in the thirteenth century by St.  Yves, and dedicated to St. Tugdual, whose name, like St. Yves, is often  given in baptism to the Breton children. St. Yves is buried here, and also  Duke John V., who founded the Chapelle du Duc, and desired to be interred  at the feet of St. Yves, for whom he had a special regard, and to whom he  erected a magnificent tomb, for three centuries the object of veneration  in Brittany. The Duke paid for it his own weight in silver (389 marks 7  oz.), in 1424, to Maistre Jacques de Hougue. The victories of his father  John the Conqueror were chased in bas-relief round the tomb, which was  destroyed in 1793. Duke John V. was a contemptible prince, who eight times  changed his party from weakness rather than policy, and on whom Margaret  de Clisson and her sons retaliated the cowardly seizure of her father, the  Constable Clisson, by Duke John IV. One of the towers of the cathedral is  called the tower of Hastings, but its date is evidently subsequent to that  of the Norman freebooter. The cathedral has preserved its beautiful  cloisters, the work of the fifteenth century, although it has been ravaged  by the Normans of the ninth century, the English in the fourteenth, the  Spaniards in the sixteenth, and by the Revolutionists of 1793. It was the  port chosen by the Constable Clisson, 1387, for the invasion of England,  an expedition proposed and projected by himself. His hatred against the  English was so great, though educated in England, he was termed the  \"boucher des Anglais.\" When the Duke of Brittany gave Chandos the chateau  of Gavre, which was within a league of Clisson's chateau of Blain (Loire  Inferieure), \"I will never,\" he exclaimed, \"be the neighbour of the  English,\" and accordingly he sallied out one morning and burnt the castle  to the ground. Chandos complained to the Black Prince, who sent a letter  of remonstrance to Clisson, but it was only replied by a challenge to the  Prince to meet him in single combat. Clisson caused his own ship to be  built at Treguier, and had constructed a tower or framework of large  timber, to be put together on his landing in England, for the lords to  retreat to as a place of safety, and to be lodged therein securely in the  event of a night attack. This tower, Froissart says, was so constructed,  that when dislodged it could be taken to pieces, and many carpenters and  other workmen were engaged, at very high wages, to go with it to England  to superintend the putting of it together. Four thousand men-at-arms and  2000 cross-bowmen were in readiness for the expedition, with horses,  vessels laden with wine, salted provisions, and other necessaries. All  these formidable preparations were rendered useless by the arrest of the  Constable the day before his embarkation. We went to the Cemetery, which  has its ossuary, reliquary, or bone-house, an inseparable appendage to a  Breton churchyard. It is the custom in Brittany, after a certain time, to  dig up the bones of the dead, and preserve their skulls in little square  boxes, like dog-kennels, with a heart-shaped opening through which the  skull is visible. They are all ticketed with the names and dates of the  deceased, as \"Ci git le chef de * * * D. c. D. (decede) le * * * * *.  Priez Dieu pour son ame.\"    [Illustration: 21. Skull-box.]    These boxes sometimes occupy prominent places inside the churches or  porch, on window sills, the capitals of columns, and other ledges; but  more often are ranged in the ossuaries or charnel-houses built in the  churchyards to receive them, with a row of death's-heads carved in the  stone outside. The large bones are also placed in the ossuaire. The rich  are buried in \"enfeux\" or arched recesses in the chapels or abbeys they  have founded.    We continued our carriage to Lannion, our driver not very clear of his  way, and in Brittany the road is very difficult to be discerned; for on  each side are high earthen banks, sometimes eight or ten feet high, and on  the top of these are planted timber-trees, such as oak, elm, and ash,  which often meet at the top, entirely intercepting the view, making these  narrow lanes a perfect slough and most intricate to thread. Sometimes they  are cut in irregular steps in the solid rock, and serve for the bed of a  stream. Each field is also surrounded by these hedgerow-trees, which are  cut every four or five years.    We drove to Perros Guirec, a lovely little watering-place built on a small  promontory with a safe harbour, whence wheat, hemp, and cattle are  exported to England; it is six miles from Lannion. A dangerous rock,  called Roche Bernard, is at its entrance. The view is lovely. From Perros  we scrambled over a hilly cart-road to Ploumanach, about three miles  distant--a wonderful spot, huge round erratic blocks of pink granite flung  over land and sea in the wildest confusion. The whole coast is one sea of  boulders, a chaos of rocks of all sizes cover the soil in every direction,  and in many places there is no soil at all, and the loose masses rest on a  bare bed of rock, stretching, in unbroken extent, to a great distance. \"A  wanderer,\" says Mr. Trollope, \"amid this strange and silent scene might  fancy himself the only living thing in the midst of a world turned to  stone. In every possible variety of uncouth form and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22716"],[0,"The Book-Hunter at Home (#12)"],[1," even than Young's 'procrastination.' Worse still, it is a _waster_;  for the scrappy knowledge so often acquired by this means becomes  invariably the 'little learning' which is so dangerous--and useless--a  thing. So that unless we are strongly imbued with the spirit of scholarly  research, determined that we will not deviate one iota from the  particular side-track which we are exploring, we are in grave danger of  becoming lost in the maze of paths. Digressions in conversation and books  can be of immense value, but he must be a man of iron will who can  utilise to permanent advantage his resources in this direction. Constant  and purposeless digressions, in reading no less than in talk, are just as  injurious as interruptions. The mind is switched from one subject to  another, and an entire sequence of reasoning which we may have been  building up by the study of some days is destroyed in a few moments by  the opening up of an unexplored tract of thought.    For many years there was a learned man at work in one of our ancient  abbey libraries, cataloguing the manuscripts and monastic charters of the  ancient foundation. Their number runs into many thousands, and at the  outset the Keeper[17] realised that if this task of providing an index  and precis of the entire collection (which would be of incalculable value  to the historical students who came after him) were to be accomplished in  his lifetime, it would be necessary to adhere rigidly to his plan. Any  deviation, however slight, would mean the loss of valuable time. To the  historian and antiquary such a determination must have cost more than we  can imagine; for every now and again he came across some charter of great  historical interest. 'Ah,' he would sigh, reading it through, 'and now I  suppose you must go back again into the obscurity in which you have lain  for eight hundred years.' He quietly made his precis, indexed the  document, and replaced it in the oaken press. There, thanks to his  labours, it will be turned to at some future date to add laurels to the  'researches' of another man.    Perhaps the most innocuous way in which we may digress is by compiling  one of those delectable literary hotch-potches known as 'commonplace  books.' Here, with careful selection, we may garner those delightful  thoughts, those gay conceits or pithy stories, that strike our fancy as  we read. And though perhaps it may be urged that such collections  resemble a casket of loose jewels plucked from their settings, yet they  are jewels none the less. We may store all our collections within one  cover, or we may preserve separately our extracts from the poets, our  biographies, our meditations, or our anecdotes.    The first 'commonplacer' of whom I have seen mention was one Photius, a  colonel in the Life Guards at Constantinople during the ninth century,  or--as he was then called--Protospatharius. Later he became ambassador to  the court of Baghdad, and amused himself by compiling a volume which he  called _Myriobiblon_, a collection of extracts of the authors which he  had read. He was a man, we are told, of extraordinary vigour of mind, and  of encyclopaedical knowledge, and he was so devoted to reading that he  passed whole nights without sleep. Accordingly we are not surprised to  find that the Myriobiblon, with its Latin translation, forms a folio  volume of some 1500 pages. When on an embassy to Assyria, he carried his  library--some 300 rolls--with him, presumably on camels. Thus, we  suppose, he could bestride his dramatic camel, his poetic camel, or his  theological camel as the mood took him. The Myriobiblon was compiled  merely as a handbook for his brother Tarasius, that the latter might  enjoy a brief synopsis of what the ambassador read on his travels.  Several authors are now known only by the extracts in this book; and  among them may be mentioned a writer named Conon, who is said to have  written fifty novels, which Photius condensed to his liking. All this, of  course, was merely _pour passer le temps_; the really important works of  this bookworm being a lexicon and a number of books on theology. Needless  to say in due course he became Patriarch of Constantinople.    Who nowadays keeps a commonplace book? Doubtless a good many readers of  to-day have neither time nor inclination to indulge this pleasing  fashion, at one time so popular; but to anyone whose delight is the  reading of good books as opposed to modern novels, there can be no more  interesting amusement.    It can be a risky thing, however, this commonplacing, and he would be a  bold man who dared to assign unto any one writer a popular phrase for no  other reason than that this one has first expressed it in writing. There  is no new thing under the sun, and by continued expression a familiar  maxim becomes at last a proverb. Ask at a dinner-table who first wrote  'God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.' The knowing ones will puzzle  their brains in silence; some lady with religious tendencies will claim  it for the Holy Writ, inclining towards Isaiah; but the quiet bookish man  at the end of the table will smile in a superior way, and offer to wager  that he can name the author. You may safely accept his bet, for it is a  hundred pounds to a penny that he will proclaim Laurence Sterne to have  written it--he may even quote the context. Granted that Sterne did write  it, but Sterne was a widely-read man and a plagiarist of no mean ability.  So you may ask the bookish man how he doth account for this saying  occurring in that quaint collection of 'Outlandish Proverbs' entitled  'Jacula Prudentum,' by Master George Herbert, compiled _from ancient  sources_ full a hundred years before the birth of the 'Sentimental  Journey.'[18]    Sometimes in ancient literature one comes across an expression which is  in the vocabulary of everybody to-day, and one realises how very ancient  some of these popular aphorisms must be. 'It is not alle golde that  glareth,' wrote Chaucer, and the same theme was sung in Provencal by  Amanieu des Escas near a hundred years before. But, like 'A bird in the  hand,' it is so applicable to the failings to which mankind is prone,  that its origin must surely have been far beyond even the classics of the  old world, back in the dim ages of man's history. Common also to all  nations must some at least of these primitive sayings be, for there is a  primaeval simplicity about them that knows nothing of race or  civilisation. 'A soft answer turns away wrath,' 'Pride goes before a  fall,' 'Spare the rod and spoil the child,' are not all these and many  others, collected by King Solomon from the wisdom of the East, as  applicable to our everyday life in this age as they have ever been in the  whole history of mankind?[19] Enough of moralising, however; or else,  convinced of the futility of attempting to assign originality to any man,  you will come to agree with the young lady of fifteen who, priding  herself on the possession of a literary _flair_, once remarked to the  writer: 'In fact there is little doubt that Junius never wrote the  letters attributed to him at all!'    FOOTNOTES:    [14] Usually the precentor was also archivist and librarian.    [15] In one monastery, however, they were allowed to speak 'passing  soft.' We know that 'passing soft!'

Scott of Westminster Abbey, sometime Egerton Librarian  of the British Museum. He calendared no less than 57,000 documents at the  Abbey, but alas! a long life was insufficient to enable him to complete  his task. The whole working portion of his latter years was spent in the  muniment room, and it was there that he was seized with the illness which  ended his life the same day (1918). The work which he accomplished (now  being ably continued, on the lines which he laid down, by his successor,  the present Custodian of the Abbey) has been utilized by scholars from  universities all over the world. However busily employed, he was always  ready instantly to lay aside his work in order to assist a student over  some difficult point, whether of history or palaeography.

Sterne  might have reflected that it is not usually the custom to shear _lambs_.    Since the above was written, a correspondent has brought to the writer's  notice a sixteenth century French version:--_Au brebis tondue, dieu donne  le vent par mesure._    [19] It is curious to note how some of these famous sayings have been  wrongly assigned. A recently published _Dictionary of Quotations_,  assigns Scipio's famous dictum, 'A man is never less alone than when he  is alone,' to Swift--a slight error of some nineteen centuries. W. C.  Hazlitt in his _Book-Collector_ makes an even more delightful howler,  tracing the well-known verse in Ecclesiastes (xii. 12): 'Of making many  books there is no end . . .' etc., 'back at least to the reign of  Elizabeth' (_sic_), assigning it to a preacher at Paul's Cross in 1594.

IT is one of the tragedies of the book-collector's life that he is made  aware continually of the deficiencies of his collection. Every  bookseller's catalogue that he takes up reveals these lacunae; and even  after many years of diligent book-hunting, when he can look upon his  library with no small pride and has come to regard it as being more or  less complete (for his own purposes, that is), some intimate friend to  whom he is displaying his treasures will ask to see some well-known book,  and he will be obliged to confess that he does not possess a copy.
