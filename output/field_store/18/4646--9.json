The slayer of a brahman, the drinker of what intoxicates, the  thief, one who violates his _guru's_ bed, are great criminals--also,  whoever associates with such persons.    sl. 228. Grossly to revile one's _guru_, speaking reproachfully of the  Vedas, to slay a friend, after reading from the Veda to forget  it,--these [sins] are like to the murder of a brahman.    sl. 229. To eat forbidden food, a crooked insincere mode of dealing, a  multitude of lying words, kissing the mouth of a menstruous  woman,--these [sins] are like to drinking intoxicating liquor.    sl. 230. To steal horses, jewels, men, women, land, cows, property  pledged,--these [sins] are like to the stealing of gold.    sl. 231. To debauch a friend's wife, a maiden, a sister, a woman of  the lowest grade, a female relative, a son's wife,--these [sins] are  recorded as equivalent to violation of a _guru's_ bed.    sl. 232. To debauch a father's sister, or a mother's, the wife of a  maternal uncle, a daughter-in-law, a step-mother, the sister or  daughter of an _acharya_,    sl. 233. or his wife, or one's own daughter,--these are equal to  violation of a _guru's_ bed. The penalty is death, the pudenda [of the  criminal] being previously amputated. A like doom is for the woman, if  she consented.    See Manu, ch. 9, sl. 235; ch. 11, sl. 54--58, sl. 170--180.    As to the _guru_ and _acharya_, the following is the 34th sloka of  Yajnavalkya's first book:--He is a man's _guru_, who, after going  through the ritual, imparts to him the Veda: he is _acharya_, who  invests with the sacred cord and then imparts the Veda.]    [Footnote 156: Manu, ch. 8, sl. 89 &c.]    [Footnote 157: _guni_, referring not merely to personal qualities or  eminence in virtue, but to possession of wealth, sons, and learning:  so explained by the Commentator.]    [Footnote 158: Manu, ch. 8, sl. 73.]    [Footnote 159: The Commentator explains this to refer to the fine  which would be payable on failure (supra sl. 11).]    [Footnote 160: out of the realm.

He explains the enormity of the offence  described in this sloka to consist in the contempt of Court.]    [Footnote 163: _i. e._ if, by such untruth, the death be averted. If  from testimony either way, the alternative of the death of the  plaintiff or defendant must ensue, the witness should maintain  silence, the monarch assenting. In case the monarch do not assent, the  testimony may be rendered of no avail by confusing the witness: if  this cannot be effected, then let the truth be spoken; for by so doing  one fault only is incurred, _viz._ causing the death, whereas from  untruth would arise the sin of it as well as of the death.

These again are either, autograph, _i. e._ wholly written by  the party who speaks by the document--or, written by another for him.  The last description, he says, require to be attested, and their  effect as proof depends upon local usage. He quotes Narada as to the  private writings. For the instruments emanating from authority, he  refers to sl. 317, 318, 319 of Yajnavalkya's first Book, _viz._         \"When the monarch bestows lands or creates a charge in favor       of any one, he shall, for information of future good       monarchs, put it in writing, either on cloth or copper,       setting his seal thereto. He shall inscribe the names of his       ancestors and his own [also the donee's (_M._)], the extent       of the gift, its description by boundaries, also the date;       all this shall be authenticated under his hand.\"  ]    [Footnote 171: This word in the 94th sloka we have rendered  'discharge.' Its ordinary and literal sense is 'purification.']    [Footnote 172: _scil._ ordeals.

Of that which is inherited or ancestral, there  is co-ownership: it cannot therefore be apportioned at the father's  pleasure. (_M._) Infra sl. 121.]    [Footnote 176: Jagannat'ha, in his Digest, quotes the Dipakalika and  other authorities interpreting this injunction to refer to such wives  only as have not male issue. (Colebrooke, vol. 3, p. 97.)]    [Footnote 177: Something, however valueless; in order that the heirs  of the separated son may have no claim to a share of the family  inheritance, (_M._) Manu, ch. 9, sl. 207.]    [Footnote 178: For instance, if one son have a large family, or be  disqualified to earn a livelihood, the father may give him a portion  larger than the others. But an unequal partition from angry impulse,  or weak-mindedness, has no validity. (_M._)]    [Footnote 179: Manu, ch. 9, sl. 104. Whenever the father wishes, is  one of the ordained periods for partition; the second is, when the  father has renounced worldly enjoyment and the mother is past  child-bearing; and this partition may be enforced (according to  Narada) at the son's desire, though the father object. Partition  should also be made, the son desiring it, if the father lead a vicious  life, or be suffering under incurable disease; even though the  mother's menstruation have not ceased. The third period for partition  is, the father's decease. (_M._) Manu divides,--to the eldest two  aliquot parts, to the second son one and a half, and to each  succeeding son a single part. The Commentator asks, why that division  was not adhered to; and he solves his own question by the remark, that  it was disliked by the people, and therefore rightly abandoned. This  position he supports by several quotations, and by allusion to the  abolition or non-observance of other ancient ordinances, _e.g._ the  raising up of male heirs by the brother of the husband or others.    It is an obvious reflection, that the altered law of distribution is  one of the few instances in the Hindu economy where an innate feeling  of natural equality has overcome or superseded arbitrary rule--and  further, that the change has been brought about by the pressure of the  old law upon the privileged casts, who, in common with others, were  affected by it.]    [Footnote 180: Manu, ch. 9, sl. 206, 208.]    [Footnote 181: When the recovered properly is land, he who obtained it  shall take a fourth part, the remainder to be equally divided.

The lightning flashed more and  more vividly, black clouds were coming nearer and nearer. What was a  distant rumble soon became a near-by, long undertow of ominous sound.  Nearer and nearer it came, until every flash was followed by a sound  like ripping.    Mrs. Reece was very uneasy, for she did not like to have the children in  the tents alone. But soon Betty and Hope came scampering through the  dark to the cabin. They were surprised to see the older people up.  Before long the boys also came to the cabin rubbing their eyes, yawning,  and pretending not to care whether there was to be a cyclone or a  cloud-burst.    For a while all sat waiting for the storm to break. When it did break,  what torrents of rain and wind descended! How the trees groaned and  cracked! How the rain roared upon the shingled roof, and how the wind  howled through the mountain valley!    \"Well,\" said Ben Gile, \"let's have a fire in the fireplace, then we can  have a crackle of our own.\" He had noticed how nervous Mrs. Reece grew,  and that the little girls were watching her. He could not help thinking  that it was foolish, even wicked, to waste strength in fear of something  which no one of them could stop. \"Build a fire, boys.\" And build a fire  they did--a royal good blaze. \"Now throw on some of those pine-cones you  children gathered.\" There was a flare in the cabin almost as bright as  the incessant flare of the lightning outside. \"I'll tell you what we'll  do,\" he continued, \"we will have a midnight spread. We will have some of  Tom's famous flapjacks. Mrs. Reece, don't you want to make molasses  candy, and then the children can pull it.\"    The storm was forgotten by the children as, with many squeals of glee,  they rushed into this midnight frolic.    \"And now, Ben,\" said Tom, the guide, \"I've just found something; I have  it in my hand. I propose, Ben, while the rest of us work, that you make  one of your stories out of it, and tell us all about it.\"    Tom opened his hand, and the children crowded around to see. There was a  shout of laughter.    \"Why, that's only a dead June-bug!\"    \"Who wants to know about a June-bug?\" exclaimed Jimmie, much to the  discomfiture of the guide, who knew a great deal about moose and deer  and bears and beavers, even if he didn't know much about a June-bug. The  guides had profound respect for the schoolmaster, Ben Gile, who was  really too wise and kind to laugh at another's ignorance. But this is  another story, and Jimmie learned better in the years to come.    \"You're right, Tom,\" said Ben, \"to want to know. Sometimes it's about  these commonest things folks know the least. When I was a boy it was  always so with me. There are several facts about a June-bug that are  interesting. First, it is not a bug at all; and, second, it comes in  May and not in June. It is really a May-beetle, and a great, clumsy,  buzzing, blundering fellow it is, as careless about its appearance as it  is about the way it enters a room. You know the old adage, 'Haste makes  waste'? Perhaps it's the haste that makes the June-bug's untidiness.  Beetles have hard wing covers--see these little shell-like casings?--to  cover the more delicate wings underneath. The June-bug has wing covers,  too, but it never keeps its best wings tucked in. They are always  hanging out in a crumpled way. These bugs eat the leaves of the trees,  and their children, little, fat, white grubs with horny heads, nibble,  as they crawl around under the surface of the earth, the tender roots of  the grass and the strawberry plants.\"    \"Why, Ben, you've told me more already,\" said Tom, \"than any dullard  like me could ever learn from a book. To think it's a beetle! But I  might have known from looking at it. Are all the beetles harmful?\"    \"Most of them are pests, and do a good deal of damage. Its cousin,  rose-beetle, is pretty, her body covered with soft, yellow hairs, and  she has rose-colored legs. But handsome is as handsome does, and  rose-beetle causes more damage than her clumsy cousin, for Rose feeds  on rose-bushes as well as on fruit trees. Indeed, almost everything that  comes to her mill is grist. She's as bad--and worse--than the  elm-beetle.\"    By this time the cooking molasses smelled so good, the cabin fire roared  so pleasantly, and the smell of the flapjacks Adam was frying was so  appetizing, that the children had quite forgotten the storm outside, and  were having one of the jolliest frolics of their lives--one they never  forgot.    \"Tell us something more, sir,\" urged Jack, \"about the beetles.\"    \"There is one comical fellow who makes me think of Peter. In the books  it is called a click-beetle, but it is also called a skip-jack because  of the somersaults it can turn. On the under side of its thorax is a  spine resting on the edge of a hole. This funny beetle, by pushing the  spine down over the hole and then letting it go, throws itself up in the  air with a sharp click.\"    \"Oh, I know them,\" called Hope, \"for I have seen them doing it, but I  never knew how they did it!\"    \"And now,\" said Master All-Wise, very soberly, \"after I tell you that  the children of the click-beetle are called wire-worms, and that they  eat and kill the roots of plants, I want to tell you about a beetle no  one of you has ever seen--a most extraordinary beetle.\"    [Illustration:  _A._ Lady-beetle.  _B._ Burying-beetle.  _C._ Oil-beetle.]    All were attention at once.    \"Many years ago there lived away out in California a little, round,  brownish, striped beetle, which crawled about and ate heartily of a  plant called the sand-bur. One day one of the family happened to wander  up to a nice, juicy potato plant. After eating its fill it probably  looked up some of its brothers and sisters, and told them about these  good plants growing in the fields. With one accord they left the  sand-burs and began to eat the potato plant. Farther and farther they  wandered, until thousands of them reached the eastern part of our  country, eating the potato plants wherever they found them on the way.  Now, these beetles are to be seen everywhere in our country, spoiling  crop after crop.\"    By this time Jack's eager face was smiling, and he was looking  questioningly at Ben Gile.    \"What kind of a beetle do you suppose it was?\" asked the old man.    Nobody knew. At last Jack ventured, \"Was it a potato-bug, sir?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Oh, of course!\" shouted the children. \"Why didn't we think of that?  But you said we had never seen it.\"    \"So I did,\" said the guide, \"and I don't believe there is one child here  who has ever carefully watched the potato-bug. And there's the  carpet-beetle, whose babies eat carpets unless your mother tempts them  with pieces of red flannel. And there's the searcher-beetle, with its  pretty green or violet wing covers, who is always on the search for  caterpillars. And there's the fire-fly, which is a soft-bodied beetle.    \"And there's the very useful little beetle we call the ladybug, which is  not a bug, but a beetle. The ladybug is a great help to men who own  fruit orchards in the West. All over the country are to be found little  bugs called scale insects. These scales are very bad for trees, because  with their long, slender beaks the scales pump out the sap. Sometimes  they are so thick on the branch that they coat it entirely. You remember  that I told you that one of these troublesome scales is the  cottony-cushion scale, and that one day it was discovered that a  lady-beetle from Australia liked these scales very much. So a great many  of them were taken to California to eat the scales. The ladybugs eat  little green aphids, too, and often Mrs. Ladybug will lay her eggs  right in the midst of a family of aphids; and then the larvae are  surrounded by a hearty lunch when they come out of the egg. They eat the  aphids, the scales, and sometimes the eggs of other insects.\"    \"Time, Ben,\" said Adam, \"to have the flapjacks. I guess the storm must  be blowing over.\"    All drew up to the cabin table, and ate as heartily as if they were  eating dinner. It really looked as if the children had had no supper.    \"In about half an hour,\" said Tom, \"the storm will be over. Aren't there  any beetles that live in the water, Ben?\"    \"Oh yes; you can see them any day if you go by a brook. The  diving-beetles are skimming about, rowing themselves along with their  flattened hind legs. Every few minutes they come to the surface and lift  their wings to get a little air under them, then down they go into the  brook. They are very hungry beetles, eating other insects which they  find in the water. The boldest often try to take a bite out of a fish.  Just think of calling a baby beetle a water-tiger! Well, these babies  are as savage and ferocious to the little creatures living about them in  the water as a big tiger would be to us, if we should happen to meet  one.    \"I like best the whirligig-beetles, they are such frisky fellows, always  having a good time, frolicking about with dozens of other little  whirligigs. They are bluish-black and shiny, and if you look carefully  you will see a little bubble at the tip of every tail. This little  bubble is held there by tiny hairs, and because whirligig has it, it can  breathe while it stays under the water. From time to time it comes to  the surface to get a new bubble, then is off again for another race or  game of tag with its friends, and at the same time to snap up a few  water creatures for dinner. It looks as though it had four eyes, but it  has not, just two, divided into upper and lower halves. The upper halves  look up through the water and the lower ones down at the bottom of the  brooks. So, you see, insects must step lively if they want to keep out  of its clutches.    \"The babies of some beetles, instead of liking nice, clean food, prefer  dead animals. The mother and father hunt around until they find a dead  mouse or bird; then"]]]
