At the third fire Wolfe  was fatally wounded, and as he was carried back to the rear he heard  some one exclaim,--    \"They run! They run!\"    \"Who run?\" inquired Wolfe.    \"The French! The French!\" came the reply.    \"Now God be praised,\" said Wolfe, \"I die happy.\"    Montcalm had a similar experience. He was fatally wounded. \"They run!  They run!\" he heard some one say.    \"Who run?\" exclaimed Montcalm, wetting his lips with a lemonade-glass of  cognac.    \"We do,\" replied the man.    \"Then so much the better,\" said Montcalm, as his eye lighted up, \"for I  shall not live to see Quebec surrendered.\"    This shows what can be done without a rehearsal; also how the historian  has to control himself in order to avoid lying.    The death of these two brave men is a beautiful and dramatic incident in  the history of our country, and should be remembered by every  school-boy, because neither lived to write articles criticising the  other.    Five days later the city capitulated. An attempt was made to recapture  it, but it was not successful. Canada fell into the hands of the  English, and from the open Polar Sea to the Mississippi the English flag  floated.    What an empire!    What a game-preserve!    Florida was now ceded to the already cedy crown of England by Spain, and  brandy-and-soda for the wealthy and bitter beer became the drink of the  poor.    [Illustration: REMAINED BY IT TILL DEATH.]    Pontiac's War was brought on by the Indians, who preferred the French  occupation to that of the English. Pontiac organized a large number of  tribes on the spoils plan, and captured eight forts. He killed a great  many people, burned their dwellings, and drove out many more, but at  last his tribes made trouble, as there were not spoils enough to go  around, and his army was conquered. He was killed in 1769 by an Indian  who received for his trouble a barrel of liquor, with which he began to  make merry. He remained by the liquor till death came to his relief.    The heroism of an Indian who meets his enemy single-handed in that way,  and, though greatly outnumbered, dies with his face to the foe, is  deserving of more than a passing notice.    The French and Indian War cost the Colonists sixteen million dollars, of  which the English repaid only five million. The Americans lost thirty  thousand men, none of whom were replaced. They suffered every kind of  horror and barbarity, written and unwritten, and for years their taxes  were two-thirds of their income; and yet they did not murmur.    These were the fathers and mothers of whom we justly brag. These were  the people whose children we are. What are inherited titles and ancient  names many times since dishonored, compared with the heritage of  uncomplaining suffering and heroism which we boast of to-day because  those modest martyrs were working people, proud that by the sweat of  their brows they wrung from a niggardly soil the food they ate, proud  also that they could leave the plough to govern or to legislate, able  also to survey a county or rule a nation.          CHAPTER XII.    PERSONALITY OF WASHINGTON.      It would seem that a few personal remarks about George Washington at  this point might not be out of place. Later on his part in this history  will more fully appear.    [Illustration]    The author points with some pride to a study of Washington's great act  in crossing the Delaware, from a wax-work of great accuracy. The reader  will avoid confusing Washington with the author, who is dressed in a  plaid suit and on the shore, while Washington may be seen in this end of  the boat with the air of one who has just discovered the location of a  glue-factory on the side of the river.    A directory of Washington's head-quarters has been arranged by the  author of this book, and at a reunion of the general's body-servants to  be held in the future the work will be on sale.    The name of George Washington has always had about it a glamour that  made him appear more in the light of a god than a tall man with large  feet and a mouth made to fit an old-fashioned full-dress pumpkin pie.    [Illustration: STUDY OF WASHINGTON CROSSING THE DELAWARE.]    [Illustration: MY GREATEST WORK.]    George Washington's face has beamed out upon us for many years now, on  postage-stamps and currency, in marble and plaster and in bronze, in  photographs of original portraits, paintings, and stereoscopic views. We  have seen him on horseback and on foot, on the war-path and on skates,  playing the flute, cussing his troops for their shiftlessness, and then,  in the solitude of the forest, with his snorting war-horse tied to a  tree, engaged in prayer.    We have seen all these pictures of George, till we are led to believe  that he did not breathe our air or eat American groceries. But George  Washington was not perfect. I say this after a long and careful study of  his life, and I do not say it to detract the very smallest iota from the  proud history of the Father of his Country. I say it simply that the  boys of America who want to become George Washingtons will not feel so  timid about trying it.    [Illustration: WASHINGTON PLAYING THE FLUTE.]    When I say that George Washington, who now lies so calmly in the  lime-kiln at Mount Vernon, could reprimand and reproach his  subordinates, at times, in a way to make the ground crack open and  break up the ice in the Delaware a week earlier than usual, I do not  mention it in order to show the boys of our day that profanity will make  them resemble George Washington. That was one of his weak points, and no  doubt he was ashamed of it, as he ought to have been. Some poets think  that if they get drunk and stay drunk they will resemble Edgar A. Poe  and George D. Prentice. There are lawyers who play poker year after year  and get regularly skinned because they have heard that some of the able  lawyers of the past century used to come home at night with poker-chips  in their pockets.    Whiskey will not make a poet, nor poker a great pleader. And yet I have  seen poets who relied on the potency of their breath, and lawyers who  knew more of the habits of a bobtail flush than they ever did of the  statutes in such case made and provided.    [Illustration: THE AWKWARD SQUAD.]    George Washington was always ready. If you wanted a man to be first in  war, you could call on George. If you desired an adult who would be  first baseman in time of peace, Mr. Washington could be telephoned at  any hour of the day or night. If you needed a man to be first in the  hearts of his countrymen, George's post-office address was at once  secured.    Though he was a great man, he was once a poor boy. How often you hear  that in America! Here it is a positive disadvantage to be born wealthy.  And yet sometimes I wish they had experimented a little that way on me.  I do not ask now to be born rich, of course, because it is too late; but  it seems to me that, with my natural good sense and keen insight into  human nature, I could have struggled along under the burdens and cares  of wealth with great success. I do not care to die wealthy, but if I  could have been born wealthy it seems to me I would have been tickled  almost to death.    I love to believe that true greatness is not accidental. To think and to  say that greatness is a lottery, is pernicious. Man may be wrong  sometimes in his judgment of others, both individually and in the  aggregate, but he who gets ready to be a great man will surely find the  opportunity.    You will wonder whom I got to write this sentiment for me, but you will  never find out.    In conclusion, let me say that George Washington was successful for  three reasons. One was that he never shook the confidence of his  friends. Another was that he had a strong will without being a mule.  Some people cannot distinguish between being firm and being a big blue  donkey.    Another reason why Washington is loved and honored to-day is that he  died before we had a chance to get tired of him. This is greatly  superior to the method adopted by many modern statesmen, who wait till  their constituency weary of them, and then reluctantly pass away.           *       *       *       *       *         N. B.--Since writing the foregoing I have found that Washington was       not born a poor boy,--a discovery which redounds greatly to his       credit,--that he was able to accomplish so much, and yet could get       his weekly spending money and sport a French nurse in his extreme       youth.                                                                B. N.          CHAPTER XIII.    CONTRASTS WITH THE PRESENT DAY.      Here it may be well to speak briefly of the contrast between the usages  and customs of the period preceding the Revolution, and the present day.  Some of these customs and regulations have improved with the lapse of  time, others undoubtedly have not.    Two millions of people constituted the entire number of whites, while  away to the westward the red brother extended indefinitely. Religiously  they were Protestants, and essentially they were \"a God-fearing people.\"  Taught to obey a power they were afraid of, they naturally turned with  delight to the service of a God whose genius in the erection of a  boundless and successful hell challenged their admiration and esteem.  So, too, their own executions of Divine laws were successful as they  gave pain, and the most beautiful features of Christianity,--namely,  love and charity,--according to history, were not cultivated very much.    There were in New England at one time twelve offences punishable with  death, and in Virginia seventeen. This would indicate that the  death-penalty is getting unpopular very fast, and that in the contiguous  future humane people will wonder why murder should have called for  murder, in this brainy, charitable, and occult age, in which man seems  almost able to pry open the future and catch a glimpse of Destiny "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2145"],[0,"Ben-Hur: A tale of the Christ (#12)"],[1,"charm of  a life so the opposite of his own.    Yet these men, rude and simple as they were, had a knowledge and  a wisdom of their own. On Sabbaths they were accustomed to purify  themselves, and go up into the synagogues, and sit on the benches  farthest from the ark. When the chazzan bore the Torah round,  none kissed it with greater zest; when the sheliach read the text,  none listened to the interpreter with more absolute faith; and none  took away with them more of the elder's sermon, or gave it more  thought afterwards. In a verse of the Shema they found all the  learning and all the law of their simple lives--that their Lord  was One God, and that they must love him with all their souls.  And they loved him, and such was their wisdom, surpassing that  of kings.    While they talked, and before the first watch was over, one by  one the shepherds went to sleep, each lying where he had sat.    The night, like most nights of the winter season in the hill  country, was clear, crisp, and sparkling with stars. There was  no wind. The atmosphere seemed never so pure, and the stillness  was more than silence; it was a holy hush, a warning that heaven  was stooping low to whisper some good thing to the listening earth.    By the gate, hugging his mantle close, the watchman walked; at times  he stopped, attracted by a stir among the sleeping herds, or by  a jackal's cry off on the mountain-side. The midnight was slow  coming to him; but at last it came. His task was done; now for the  dreamless sleep with which labor blesses its wearied children! He  moved towards the fire, but paused; a light was breaking around  him, soft and white, like the moon's. He waited breathlessly.  The light deepened; things before invisible came to view; he saw  the whole field, and all it sheltered. A chill sharper than that  of the frosty air--a chill of fear--smote him. He looked up;  the stars were gone; the light was dropping as from a window  in the sky; as he looked, it became a splendor; then, in terror,  he cried,    \"Awake, awake!\"    Up sprang the dogs, and, howling, ran away.    The herds rushed together bewildered.    The men clambered to their feet, weapons in hand.    \"What is it?\" they asked, in one voice.    \"See!\" cried the watchman, \"the sky is on fire!\"    Suddenly the light became intolerably bright, and they covered  their eyes, and dropped upon their knees; then, as their souls  shrank with fear, they fell upon their faces blind and fainting,  and would have died had not a voice said to them,    \"Fear not!\"    And they listened.    \"Fear not: for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,  which shall be to all people.\"    The voice, in sweetness and soothing more than human, and low and  clear, penetrated all their being, and filled them with assurance.  They rose upon their knees, and, looking worshipfully, beheld in  the centre of a great glory the appearance of a man, clad in a  robe intensely white; above its shoulders towered the tops of  wings shining and folded; a star over its forehead glowed with  steady lustre, brilliant as Hesperus; its hands were stretched  towards them in blessing; its face was serene and divinely beautiful.    They had often heard, and, in their simple way, talked, of angels;  and they doubted not now, but said, in their hearts, The glory of  God is about us, and this is he who of old came to the prophet by  the river of Ulai.    Directly the angel continued:    \"For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Savior,  which is Christ the Lord!\"    Again there was a rest, while the words sank into their minds.    \"And this shall be a sign unto you,\" the annunciator said next.  \"Ye shall find the babe, wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in  a manger.\"    The herald spoke not again; his good tidings were told; yet he  stayed awhile. Suddenly the light, of which he seemed the centre,  turned roseate and began to tremble; then up, far as the men could  see, there was flashing of white wings, and coming and going of  radiant forms, and voices as of a multitude chanting in unison,    \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards  men!\"    Not once the praise, but many times.    Then the herald raised his eyes as seeking approval of one far off;  his wings stirred, and spread slowly and majestically, on their upper  side white as snow, in the shadow vari-tinted, like mother-of-pearl;  when they were expanded many cubits beyond his stature, he arose  lightly, and, without effort, floated out of view, taking the  light up with him. Long after he was gone, down from the sky fell  the refrain in measure mellowed by distance, \"Glory to God in the  highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men.\"    When the shepherds came fully to their senses, they stared at each  other stupidly, until one of them said, \"It was Gabriel, the Lord's  messenger unto men.\"    None answered.    \"Christ the Lord is born; said he not so?\"    Then another recovered his voice, and replied, \"That is what he  said.\"    \"And did he not also say, in the city of David, which is our  Bethlehem yonder. And that we should find him a babe in  swaddling-clothes?\"    \"And lying in a manger.\"    The first speaker gazed into the fire thoughtfully, but at length  said, like one possessed of a sudden resolve, \"There is but one  place in Bethlehem where there are mangers; but one, and that is  in the cave near the old khan. Brethren, let us go see this thing  which has come to pass. The priests and doctors have been a long  time looking for the Christ. Now he is born, and the Lord has  given us a sign by which to know him. Let us go up and worship  him.\"    \"But the flocks!\"    \"The Lord will take care of them. Let us make haste.\"    Then they all arose and left the marah.    * * * * * *    Around the mountain and through the town they passed, and came to  the gate of the khan, where there was a man on watch.    \"What would you have?\" he asked.    \"We have seen and heard great things to-night,\" they replied.    \"Well, we, too, have seen great things, but heard nothing. What did  you hear?\"    \"Let us go down to the cave in the enclosure, that we may be sure;  then we will tell you all. Come with us, and see for yourself.\"    \"It is a fool's errand.\"    \"No, the Christ is born.\"    \"The Christ! How do you know?\"    \"Let us go and see first.\"    The man laughed scornfully.    \"The Christ indeed! How are you to know him?\"    \"He was born this night, and is now lying in a manger, so we  were told; and there is but one place in Bethlehem with mangers.\"    \"The cave?\"    \"Yes. Come with us.\"    They went through the court-yard without notice, although there  were some up even then talking about the wonderful light. The door  of the cavern was open. A lantern was burning within, and they  entered unceremoniously.    \"I give you peace,\" the watchman said to Joseph and the Beth  Dagonite. \"Here are people looking for a child born this night,  whom they are to know by finding him in swaddling-clothes and  lying in a manger.\"    For a moment the face of the stolid Nazarene was moved; turning away,  he said, \"The child is here.\"    They were led to one of the mangers, and there the child was. The  lantern was brought, and the shepherds stood by mute. The little  one made no sign; it was as others just born.    \"Where is the mother?\" asked the watchman.    One of the women took the baby, and went to Mary, lying near,  and put it in her arms. Then the bystanders collected about  the two.    \"It is the Christ!\" said a shepherd, at last.    \"The Christ!\" they all repeated, falling upon their knees in worship.  One of them repeated several times over,    \"It is the Lord, and his glory is above the earth and heaven.\"    And the simple men, never doubting, kissed the hem of the mother's  robe, and with joyful faces departed. In the khan, to all the people  aroused and pressing about them, they told their story; and through  the town, and all the way back to the marah, they chanted the refrain  of the angels, \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,  good-will towards men!\"    The story went abroad, confirmed by the light so generally seen;  and the next day, and for days thereafter, the cave was visited  by curious crowds, of whom some believed, though the greater part  laughed and mocked.          CHAPTER XII      The eleventh day after the birth of the child in the cave,  about mid-afternoon, the three wise men approached Jerusalem by  the road from Shechem. After crossing Brook Cedron, they met many  people, of whom none failed to stop and look after them curiously.    Judea was of necessity an international thoroughfare; a narrow  ridge, raised, apparently, by the pressure of the desert on  the east, and the sea on the west, was all she could claim to  be; over the ridge, however, nature had stretched the line of  trade between the east and the south; and that was her wealth.  In other words, the riches of Jerusalem were the tolls she levied  on passing commerce. Nowhere else, consequently, unless in Rome,  was there such constant assemblage of so many people of so many  different nations; in no other city was a stranger less strange  to the residents than within her walls and purlieus. And yet these  three men excited the wonder of all whom they met on the way to  the gates.    A child belonging to some women sitting by the roadside opposite  the Tombs of the Kings saw the party coming; immediately it clapped  its hands, and cried, \"Look, look! What pretty bells! What big  camels!\"    The bells were silver; the camels, as we have seen, were of unusual  size and whiteness, and moved with singular stateliness; the trappings  told of the desert and of long journeys thereon, and also of ample  means in possession of the owners, who sat under the little canopies  exactly as they appeared at the rendezvous beyond the Jebel. Yet it  was not the bells or the camels, or their furniture, or the demeanor"]]]
