GRECO-RUMANIAN FRIENDSHIP.    _The Rumanian Minister, Mr. Filidor, presented his new credentials to  King Constantine on Dec. 14. His speech appears below._    Your Majesty! I have the honor to deliver to your Majesty the letters  with which his Majesty, my august sovereign, has deigned to confirm my  quality as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to your  Majesty, a mission which I had already the honor of filling under the  glorious reign of the great King Carol I., the founder of the Rumanian  dynasty.    I happened to be a witness of the most brilliant period of the history  of new Greece, during which your Majesty at the head of his Government  has succeeded, by his military talents, in bringing into realization  the great achievements of ancient Greece, whose majestic relics are  serving still as an inimitable example to the whole of mankind.    The military effort of your Majesty has been crowned by the Treaty of  Bucharest, which was a common pacifying work of Greece and Rumania,  and which was so instrumental in strengthening the bonds of friendship  and interests which so happily unite the two peoples.    Deeply impressed by the conviction that my mission consists in working  for this latter end, I dare pray your Majesty to grant me his august  favor, as in the past, and I assure you that I will employ all my  energy for the fulfillment of this effort, so necessary for the future  fortunes of both countries.          Where Rumania Stands in the Crisis    Declaration of Neutrality      BUCHAREST, Aug. 5, 1914.    The Council of the Crown has decided on the neutrality of  Rumania--Agence Roumaine.      THE SITUATION IN RUMANIA.    [From the Paris Temps of Aug. 23, 1914.]    From an occasional correspondent we receive the following letter:    The departure of the mobilized French soldiers who were in Bucharest  has been the occasion for sympathetic manifestations toward France.    Among the population and in the streets there was not a single voice  which was not heartily and enthusiastically for the Triple Entente in  general and France in particular.    Certain personages, such as the General Pilot who in 1870 fought on  the side of France, and certain newspaper editors who, yielding to  national aspirations, have carried on since the first day of the war a  violent campaign against Austria, are enthusiastically cheered by the  public in the cafes and by the majority of the army officers who  assisted in uniform at these scenes.    More than that, there were imposing manifestations in the streets;  other meetings, still more effective, were held in secret, at which  Generals and superior officers assisted. But notwithstanding this  public sentiment the police are on the lookout; the orders they have  received are particularly severe, as entire regiments are kept in  readiness in the public parks and Government buildings. All those  functionaries who are suspected of being openly hostile to Austria are  closely followed and watched.    What is the reason of this? One may put the question to himself, as  really this sentiment of the nations corresponds too well with a  secular and inevitable policy. Despite all contrary reasoning, one  fact remains, and this is summed up in Transylvania and Bukowina and  the five million Rumanians who are under Austro-Hungarian rule. There  is for the Rumanians of the kingdom the unforgettable series of  persecutions of every kind to which their brethren on the other side  of the mountains are subjected--persecutions dating from yesterday and  which are continued today. Only the day before the Austrian  mobilization fifty students from the Rumanian Kingdom who happened to  be in Brassow (Hungary) on an excursion were arrested and brought  before the police authorities, and actually thrown into prison,  because they dared display badges with Rumanian colors in their  buttonholes.    \"If I were to march into Moldavia,\" a Rumanian was telling me,  \"against the enemies of Austria, I would have to begin by sabring all  the Moldavian peasants, who are crying, 'Down with Austria!' Of  course, I never could do this!\"    Under such conditions, if the waverings of the Government were to be  explained, the task would be a hard one. In our opinion, they may be  ascribed to different causes, the more important factor being the  opinion of the King himself; but this alone would not suffice.    The King (Carol) is first of all bound to Emperor Francis Joseph by an  old friendship. King Carol has never admitted that the diminution of  his kingdom after Plevna was a right thing, and the toasts in  Constanza (during the Czar's visit to Rumania early in the Summer of  1914) have demonstrated, for those who could read between the lines,  in both the politeness of the Czar and the reserved tone of King  Carol, that this sentiment had not yet disappeared.    In the face of this disposition, so firmly expressed, the Ministers  and the party leaders of Rumania felt rather uncomfortable. It must be  borne in mind that a parliamentary regime, properly speaking, does not  exist; the Ministries do not fall by vote of the chambers of  Parliament. When the King estimates that a Ministry has been too long  in power, when he hears distinctly the murmur of the Opposition, then  he calls a new President of the Council, who has Parliament prorogued  and a new one formed--this is the exact procedure--according to his  liking. By reason of this process, and also by reason of a special  attraction which the Court exercises over a small, refined, and  elegant society, the counsels of the King are inspired by the advices  of his counselors.    But there are also other reasons that plead for this uncertain  attitude, and by which it is attempted to justify a policy of  indifference.    The successes of last year--of which the Rumanians have not understood  the causes, because they never tried to understand them--have troubled  them in a certain way.    Their statesmen persist perhaps a little too much in playing  Machiavelli, and in exalting abstention to a system. Their fondest  desire at the present moment is not, we are persuaded, to march on  Austria, but, on the contrary, not to march at all, and not to  intervene in the war up to the day of the final liquidation.    What is this policy worth? The chances are that it may not always be  good, particularly in the present state of things. Rumania is still a  small country by reason of its area. In addition to this, her  neighbors, on which she was wont to exercise a moderating influence,  are bound to change in density of population. And it is very likely  that Rumania, on the next day after the war, might find herself  suddenly surrounded by homogeneous peoples, who in the meantime would  become distinctly more important than she is, and that these people  might have against her certain slight grievances which they would make  her feel. Moreover, even if Austria by chance is victorious, and even  if the Government at Bucharest helped her, is it not clear that her  (Rumania's) Hungarian neighbor, becoming stronger, would make her  (Rumania) suffer the same as she made the Servians suffer when they  were feeble?    Rumania may well protest her friendship, but this will not prevent  her, if only by her presence, from being a danger to the tranquillity  of the Hungarian subjects in Transylvania. And then who is going to  defend her?    Here is what the good sense of the people says, and it is this common  sense which will triumph in the end over all vacillation, and will, in  spite of everything, assert its way of seeing things.      THE ATTITUDE OF RUMANIA.    [From the Paris Temps of Sept. 25, 1914.]    Mr. Diamandy, Rumanian Minister at Petrograd and an ardent advocate of  Rumanian intervention, has returned to the Russian capital after a  voyage to Bucharest, where he went in order to explain his views to  his Government.    The return of Mr. Diamandy to Petrograd is regarded as a favorable  omen, as this diplomat had expressed previous to his departure that he  would not come back to his post if he were not successful in placing  Rumania on the side of the Triple Entente.    On the other hand, l'Agence de Balkans is in receipt of the following  dispatch from Bucharest, Sept. 19, 1914:    \"The semi-official papers of the Rumanian Government have published  the following statement with regard to the Treaty of Bucharest: The  viewpoint of Rumania on the subject of the Treaty of Bucharest, and of  its connection with the European war, has been discussed and  established in a council of the Crown, held on the 21st of July, (Aug.  3, N.S.) In the Treaty of Bucharest the Rumanian interest was not  bound to fixed frontier lines, except so long as these assured an  equilibrium necessary to Rumania. Rumania was not obliged to protect  this equilibrium in its actual form any longer than in her mind this  could be possibly maintained.    \"If the European war, in its future consequences, should bring about  certain modifications in the actual frontiers of one or the other of  the Balkan States, the interest of Rumania requires that the Balkan  equilibrium be established in accordance with the changes made to  correspond with the purpose of maintaining the real equilibrium in its  new form, no matter what the frontier lines will be in their final  re-establishment. In connection with the attitude of Rumania in the  presence of the European war no new decision has been taken. All the  political parties are subjecting their attitude to the action of the  Government. Mr. von Busch, the new Minister of Germany, has arrived  and was received yesterday in confidence by King Charles.\"      DEATH OF KING CHARLES.    [From The London Times, Oct. 12, 1914.]    King Charles of Rumania died of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20523"],[0,"Religion and Art in Ancient Greece (#12)"],[1,"in a statue which seems at first sight  a mere allegory of its situation. The way in which the figure is seated,  half turned on herself, and with her feet resting upon the shoulder of  the river that swims below her, seems to suggest an artificially  invented symbolism; yet we are expressly told that this statue received  great veneration from the natives of the district. In the decay of the  belief in the gods, there seems to have been a craving for nearer and  more real objects of worship.    We can see the same tendency in a more extreme form in the deification  of human beings. Though some examples of this occur earlier, especially  in the case of the heroes or founders of cities, these are not placed on  a level with the gods; but the worship of Alexander, and in imitation of  him, of his successors, placed him in a distinctly divine rank. It is  difficult to say how far this was due to non-Hellenic influences. In the  case of Alexander, with his marvellous, almost superhuman achievements,  and his final solution of the great drama of the contest of East and  West, such idealisation is easy to understand; and we find not only that  Alexander is himself represented as a god, but that his expression and  cast of features come to affect the sculpture of his age, even in the  representations of the gods themselves. On coins, too, his head occurs;  an honour that before his time was not given to mere mortals. In other  cases this worship of men reached a pitch which was a matter of shame to  the later Greeks; thus Demetrius Poliorcetes, when he gave Athens back  her freedom, was welcomed at the city with divine honours. Even hymns  were composed in his honour, of which we find specimens preserved.[7]  After welcoming his advent at the same time as that of Demeter, the poet  addresses him thus:--\"Other gods are either far away, or they have no  ears, or they exist not, or have no care for us. But we see thee, a  present deity, not of wood or stone, but real; therefore we pray to  thee.\" It is true that such materialistic and atheistic expressions were  probably reprobated by many at the time, as well as by later writers;  but the mere possibility of their public enunciation shows how far the  Athenians had gone from their old religious beliefs.    [Footnote 7: Athen., VI, 63.]    Allegorical impersonations, such as that of Antioch, are religious  conceptions of a high order compared to this. Nevertheless, one feels  that such impersonations can have no separate divine existence apart  from the city or the people whom they represent. They are on a different  plane of religious belief from Athena, for example, as the goddess of  the city. The goddess was, indeed, in some ways representative of what  was best in her chosen people; but she was not a mere symbol of its  character and its greatness. She existed before it, and would continue  though it should disappear from the earth, unlike the Fortune of  Antioch, whose very existence was bound up with that of the city she  represented.    Another example of personification may be seen in the recumbent figures  of river-gods--notably that of the Nile, with his sixteen cubits, as  babies, playing around him. River-gods were indeed an object of worship  from early times in Greece, and so appear on coins and elsewhere; but  this figure of the Nile, a product of Alexandrian art, is not like the  earlier gods, who were looked upon as the givers of increase and  fertility; it is a mere allegorical impersonation of the river, such as  might be made by a modern artist who made no pretence to believe in the  existence of such an anthropomorphic river-god. It cannot be counted as  religious art at all. And the attributes and accessories of such a  figure, the crocodile and hippopotamus, the sphinx and corn and horn of  plenty, are all of them symbolic allusions such as are suitable to such  a frigid personification. The art of Alexandria is full of such devices;  that of Pergamon is more vigorous and dramatic; but in both alike we  find the influence of a learned study of mythology, full of quaint and  far-fetched allusions and symbols. The culmination of this learned  mythology is to be seen in the great altar of Pergamon, on which the  gods who are in combat with the giants include not only all figures,  appropriate and inappropriate, from the Hellenic pantheon, but many  other deities whose right of admission to that pantheon is more than  doubtful. The figures of the gods no longer correspond to the belief in  any real divinities, but are either mere artistic types, repeated again  and again in accordance with convention, or else they are regarded as  symbols representing different aspects of divine power.    Symbolism of this kind is a common symptom of the decay of religious  faith. The more thoughtful or educated classes, who follow the  speculations of philosophers as to the nature of the deity, find it  possible to reconcile these speculations with the forms of popular  religion by accepting the forms in a symbolic sense. The common people,  on the other hand, finding the old forms inadequate to satisfy their  religious aspirations, import new and strange divinities, whose cult is  often mixed with magic or mystic rites. Here, too, the symbols have a  meaning other than what appears to the uninitiated eye, and the province  of art, which approaches the mind through the senses, is closely  circumscribed. A statue or other work of art which needs explanation of  its allusions, which does not express an ideal that appeals directly to  the imagination of the people, has lost touch with religion, and cannot  to any appreciable extent influence it or be influenced by it. The age  of idolatry in the higher sense, of a religious imagination that enables  the artist to bring the people nearer to their gods, or even the gods  nearer to the heart of the people, has passed away, and in its place we  find either a superstitious clinging to the magic power of the early  objects of worship, or a mere acceptance, as conventional symbols, of  forms that bear no direct relation to anything that is believed in as  real.    Our brief historical survey has shown us how the Greeks, starting from a  belief, such as is common to many primitive religions, in the superhuman  powers or sanctity of certain objects, were enabled by their vivid  anthropomorphic imagination first to think of the gods as in like form  to themselves, and then to make their images in human shape. And as  their art progressed towards the power of making a physical type of  perfect beauty to serve as the means of expression of this \"human form  divine,\" and also to skill in expressing character by means of human  features and figures, it became possible for them to embody in their  great statues the various ideals of divinity which belonged to their  chief gods. Here the skill of the artist would have availed little or  nothing if he had not shared with the people for whom he worked a belief  in the reality of these ideals, not merely as philosophic aspects of the  divine nature, but as real beings who were able to help and to inspire,  and to manifest themselves to their worshippers in this human form. The  next step is towards an even more vivid realisation of the personality  of the gods; but by bringing them nearer to human level it made the  worship of their images less easy to accept in a literal sense to the  more thoughtful, while such worship tended, with the common people, to  enter upon a more material and less exalted phase. The result was a  tendency towards symbolism in which the symbol itself was regarded as a  mere convention, and the inspiration and actual communion with men,  vouchsafed by the gods through their ideal images, was no longer sought  after. When any means of communion between god and man, whether by means  of a solemn service or by means of an image which the god himself  accepts as his earthly representative, ceases to be felt as anything  more than a human device, its religious power must fail. When, on the  other hand, we find a union of religion and art to provide a means for  this divine intercourse, we may recognise idolatry in its highest form,  the use of images not merely as accessories of religious service, but as  providing in themselves a channel of worship and inspiration.
