May all our actions be spiritual, and all our interests and affections be  centred in the Kingdom of Glory!          THE EVOLUTION OF THE SPIRIT      15 Rue Greuze, Paris,  November 10th    'Abdu'l-Baha said:    Tonight I will speak of the evolution or progress of the spirit.    Absolute repose does not exist in nature. All things either make progress  or lose ground. Everything moves forward or backward, nothing is without  motion. From his birth, a man progresses physically until he reaches  maturity, then, having arrived at the prime of his life, he begins to  decline, the strength and powers of his body decrease, and he gradually  arrives at the hour of death. Likewise a plant progresses from the seed to  maturity, then its life begins to lessen until it fades and dies. A bird  soars to a certain height and having reached the highest possible point in  its flight, begins its descent to earth.    Thus it is evident that movement is essential to all existence. All  material things progress to a certain point, then begin to decline. This  is the law which governs the whole physical creation.    Now let us consider the soul. We have seen that movement is essential to  existence; nothing that has life is without motion. All creation, whether  of the mineral, vegetable or animal kingdom, is compelled to obey the law  of motion; it must either ascend or descend. But with the human soul,  there is no decline. Its only movement is towards perfection; growth and  progress alone constitute the motion of the soul.    Divine perfection is infinite, therefore the progress of the soul is also  infinite. From the very birth of a human being the soul progresses, the  intellect grows and knowledge increases. When the body dies the soul lives  on. All the differing degrees of created physical beings are limited, but  the soul is limitless!    In all religions the belief exists that the soul survives the death of the  body. Intercessions are sent up for the beloved dead, prayers are said for  their progress and for the forgiveness of their sins. If the soul perished  with the body all this would have no meaning. Further, if it were not  possible for the soul to advance towards perfection after it had been  released from the body, of what avail are all these loving prayers, of  devotion?    We read in the sacred writings that 'all good works are found again'.(10)  Now, if the soul did not survive, this also would mean nothing!    The very fact that our spiritual instinct, surely never given in vain,  prompts us to pray for the welfare of those, our loved ones, who have  passed out of the material world: does it not bear witness to the  continuance of their existence?    In the world of spirit there is no retrogression. The world of mortality  is a world of contradictions, of opposites; motion being compulsory  everything must either go forward or retreat. In the realm of spirit there  is no retreat possible, all movement is bound to be towards a perfect  state. 'Progress' is the expression of spirit in the world of matter. The  intelligence of man, his reasoning powers, his knowledge, his scientific  achievements, all these being manifestations of the spirit, partake of the  inevitable law of spiritual progress and are, therefore, of necessity,  immortal.    My hope for you is that you will progress in the world of spirit, as well  as in the world of matter; that your intelligence will develop, your  knowledge will augment, and your understanding be widened.    You must ever press forward, never standing still; avoid stagnation, the  first step to a backward movement, to decay.    The whole physical creation is perishable. These material bodies are  composed of atoms; when these atoms begin to separate decomposition sets  in, then comes what we call death. This composition of atoms, which  constitutes the body or mortal element of any created being, is temporary.  When the power of attraction, which holds these atoms together, is  withdrawn, the body, as such, ceases to exist.    With the soul it is different. The soul is not a combination of elements,  it is not composed of many atoms, it is of one indivisible substance and  therefore eternal. It is entirely out of the order of the physical  creation; it is immortal!    Scientific philosophy has demonstrated that a simple element ('simple'  meaning 'not composed') is indestructible, eternal. The soul, not being a  composition of elements, is, in character, as a simple element, and  therefore cannot cease to exist.    The soul, being of that one indivisible substance, can suffer neither  disintegration nor destruction, therefore there is no reason for its  coming to an end. All things living show signs of their existence, and it  follows that these signs could not of themselves exist if that which they  express or to which they testify had no being. A thing which does not  exist, can, of course, give no sign of its existence. The manifold signs  of the existence of the spirit are for ever before us.    The traces of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the influence of His Divine  Teaching, is present with us today, and is everlasting.    A non-existent thing, it is agreed, cannot be seen by signs. In order to  write a man must exist--one who does not exist cannot write. Writing is, in  itself, a sign of the writer's soul and intelligence. The Sacred Writings  (with ever the same Teaching) prove the continuity of the spirit.    Consider the aim of creation: is it possible that all is created to evolve  and develop through countless ages with this small goal in view--a few  years of a man's life on earth? Is it not unthinkable that this should be  the final aim of existence?    The mineral evolves till it is absorbed in the life of the plant, the  plant progresses till finally it loses its life in that of the animal; the  animal, in its turn, forming part of the food of man, is absorbed into  human life.    Thus, man is shown to be the sum of all creation, the superior of all  created beings, the goal to which countless ages of existence have  progressed.    At the best, man spends four-score years and ten in this world--a short  time indeed!    Does a man cease to exist when he leaves the body? If his life comes to an  end, then all the previous evolution is useless, all has been for nothing!  Can one imagine that Creation has no greater aim than this?    The soul is eternal, immortal.    Materialists say, 'Where is the soul? What is it? We cannot see it,  neither can we touch it'.    This is how we must answer them: However much the mineral may progress, it  cannot comprehend the vegetable world. Now, that lack of comprehension  does not prove the non-existence of the plant!    To however great a degree the plant may have evolved, it is unable to  understand the animal world; this ignorance is no proof that the animal  does not exist!    The animal, be he never so highly developed, cannot imagine the  intelligence of man, neither can he realize the nature of his soul. But,  again, this does not prove that man is without intellect, or without soul.  It only demonstrates this, that one form of existence is incapable of  comprehending a form superior to itself.    This flower may be unconscious of such a being as man, but the fact of its  ignorance does not prevent the existence of humanity.    In the same way, if materialists do not believe in the existence of the  soul, their unbelief does not prove that there is no such realm as the  world of spirit. The very existence of man's intelligence proves his  immortality; moreover, darkness proves the presence of light, for without  light there would be no shadow. Poverty proves the existence of riches,  for, without riches, how could we measure poverty? Ignorance proves that  knowledge exists, for without knowledge how could there be ignorance?    Therefore the idea of mortality presupposes the existence of  immortality--for if there were no Life Eternal, there would be no way of  measuring the life of this world!    If the spirit were not immortal, how could the Manifestations of God  endure such terrible trials?    Why did Christ Jesus suffer the fearful death on the cross?    Why did Muhammad bear persecutions?    Why did the Bab make the supreme sacrifice and why did Baha'u'llah pass  the years of his life in prison?    Why should all this suffering have been, if not to prove the everlasting  life of the spirit?    Christ suffered, He accepted all His trials because of the immortality of  His spirit. If a man reflects he will understand the spiritual  significance of the law of progress; how all moves from the inferior to  the superior degree.    It is only a man without intelligence who, after considering these things,  can imagine that the great scheme of creation should suddenly cease to  progress, that evolution should come to such an inadequate end!    Materialists who reason in this way, and contend that we are unable to see  the world of spirit, or to perceive the blessings of God, are surely like  the animals who have no understanding; having eyes they see not, ears they  have, but do not hear. And this lack of sight and hearing is a proof of  nothing but their own inferiority; of whom we read in the Qur'an, 'They  are men who are blind and deaf to the Spirit.' They do not use that great  gift of God, the power of the understanding, by which they might see with  the eyes of the spirit, hear with spiritual ears and also comprehend with  a Divinely enlightened heart.    The inability of the materialistic mind to grasp the idea of the Life  Eternal is no proof of the non-existence of that life.    The comprehension of that other life depends on our spiritual birth!    My prayer for you is that your spiritual faculties and aspirations may  daily increase, and that you will never allow the material senses to veil  from your eyes the glories "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19285"],[0,"The Promulgation of Universal Peace (#12)"],[1,"souls may become the expressions of the Merciful, that  they may be educated and developed, attain to love and amity and establish  peace and agreement.    In the world of existence the animal is a captive of nature. Its actions  are according to the exigencies and requirements of nature. It has no  consideration or consciousness of good and evil. It simply follows its  natural instinct and inclination. The Prophets of God have come to show  man the way of righteousness in order that he may not follow his own  natural impulse but govern his action by the light of Their precept and  example. According to Their teachings he should do that which is found to  be praiseworthy by the standard of reason and judgment of intellect, even  though it be opposed to his natural human inclination; and he should not  do that which is found to be unworthy by that same standard, even though  it be in the direction of his natural impulse and desire. Therefore, man  must follow and manifest the attributes of the Merciful.    The imperfect members of society, the weak souls in humanity, follow their  natural trend. Their lives and actions are in accord with their natural  propensities; they are captives of physical susceptibilities; they are not  in touch or in tune with the spiritual bounties. Man has two aspects: the  physical, which is subject to nature, and the merciful or divine, which is  connected with God. If the physical or natural disposition in him should  overcome the heavenly and merciful, he is, then, the most degraded of  animal beings; and if the divine and spiritual should triumph over the  human and natural, he is, verily, an angel. The Prophets come into the  world to guide and educate humanity so that the animal nature of man may  disappear and the divinity of his powers become awakened. The divine  aspect or spiritual nature consists of the breaths of the Holy Spirit. The  second birth of which Jesus has spoken refers to the appearance of this  heavenly nature in man. It is expressed in the baptism of the Holy Spirit,  and he who is baptized by the Holy Spirit is a veritable manifestation of  divine mercy to mankind. Then he becomes just and kind to all humanity; he  entertains prejudice and ill will toward none; he shuns no nation or  people.    The foundations of the divine religions are one. If we investigate these  foundations, we discover much ground for agreement, but if we consider the  imitations of forms and ancestral beliefs, we find points of disagreement  and division; for these imitations differ, while the sources and  foundations are one and the same. That is to say, the fundamentals are  conducive to unity, but imitations are the cause of disunion and  dismemberment. Whosoever is lacking in love for humanity or manifests  hatred and bigotry toward any part of it violates the foundation and  source of his own belief and is holding to forms and imitations. Jesus  Christ declares that the sun rises upon the evil and the good, and the  rain descends upon the just and the unjust--upon all humanity alike. Christ  was a divine mercy which shone upon all mankind, the medium for the  descent of the bounty of God, and the bounty of God is transcendent,  unrestricted, universal.    The revered minister read from the words of the Gospel, \"I have yet many  things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the  Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth.\" The century  has dawned when the Spirit of Truth can reveal these verities to mankind,  proclaim that very Word, establish the real foundations of Christianity  and deliver the nations and peoples from the bondage of forms and  imitations. The cause of discord, prejudice and animosity will be removed,  the basis of love and amity be established. Therefore, all of you must  strive with heart and soul in order that enmity may disappear entirely and  that strife and hatred pass away absolutely from the midst of the human  world. You must listen to the admonition of this Spirit of Truth. You must  follow the example and footprints of Jesus Christ. Read the Gospels. Jesus  Christ was mercy itself, was love itself. He even prayed in behalf of His  executioners--for those who crucified Him--saying, \"Father, forgive them;  for they know not what they do.\" If they knew what they were doing, they  would not have done it. Consider how kind Jesus Christ was, that even upon  the cross He prayed for His oppressors. We must follow His example. We  must emulate the Prophets of God. We must follow Jesus Christ. We must  free ourselves from all these imitations which are the source of darkness  in the world.    I shall ask you a question: Did God create us for love or for enmity? Did  He create us for peace or discord? Surely He has created us for love;  therefore, we should live in accordance with His will. Do not listen to  anything that is prejudiced, for self-interest prompts men to be  prejudiced. They are thoughtful only of their own will and purposes. They  live and move in darkness. Consider how many different nations and  divergent religious beliefs existed when Christ appeared. Enmity and  strife prevailed among them--Romans, Greeks, Assyrians, Egyptians--all  warring and hostile toward each other. Christ, through the breaths of the  Holy Spirit, united them, established fellowship among them so that no  trace of strife remained. Under His standard they became united and lived  in peace through His teachings. Which is preferable and more commendable?  To follow the example of Jesus Christ or to manifest the satanic instinct?  Let us strive with all our powers to unite the East and West so that the  nations of the world may be advanced and that all may live according to  the one foundation of the religions of God. The essentials of the divine  religion are one reality, indivisible and not multiple. It is one. And  when through investigation we find it to be single, we have a basis for  the oneness of the world of humanity. I will pray for you, asking  confirmation and assistance in your behalf.          22 April 1912  Talk at Home of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur J. Parsons  1700 Eighteenth Street, NW, Washington, D.C.      Notes by Joseph H. Hannen    See how good Baha'u'llah is to us, how great the power of His Word! From  what distant parts of the world He has brought us together in this house  and caused us to meet at this heavenly table, for love has prepared a  feast and bidden 'Abdu'l-Baha to let this entertainment be in His name.  What a union of hearts and what a confirmation of Baha'u'llah between East  and West has been established! How His bounty has embraced all! How His  favors have been perfected for all!    When the Muslims conquered Persia, the chief of the Zoroastrian high  priests went to drink wine. According to Muslim law wine is forbidden, and  he who drinks it must be punished by eighty-one strokes of the whip.  Therefore, the Muslims arrested the high priest and whipped him. At that  time the Arabs were considered very low and degraded by the Persians,  scarcely to be accounted as human beings. As Muhammad was an Arab, the  Persians looked upon Him with disdain; but when the high priest saw the  evidences of a power in Muhammad which controlled these despised people,  he cried out, \"O thou Arabian Muhammad, what hast thou done? What hast  thou done which has made thy people arrest the chief high priest of the  Zoroastrians for committing something unlawful in thy religion?\" By this  circumstance the prejudice which caused the Zoroastrian to shun the Muslim  had been overcome, for he recognized in what had happened to him the great  influence Muhammad exercised over these people.    Today in this meeting we have an evidence of how Baha'u'llah through the  power of the love of God has exercised a wonderful spiritual influence  throughout the world. From the remotest parts of Persia and the Orient He  has caused men to come to this table to meet with the people of the West  in the utmost love and affection, union and harmony. Behold how the power  of Baha'u'llah has brought the East and West together. And 'Abdu'l-Baha is  standing, serving you. There is neither rod nor blow, whip nor sword; but  the power of the love of God has accomplished this.    In this world we judge a cause or movement by its progress and  development. Some movements appear, manifest a brief period of activity,  then discontinue. Others show forth a greater measure of growth and  strength, but before attaining mature development, weaken, disintegrate  and are lost in oblivion. Neither of these mentioned are progressive and  permanent.    There is still another kind of movement or cause which from a very small,  inconspicuous beginning goes forward with sure and steady progress,  gradually broadening and widening until it has assumed universal  dimensions. The Baha'i Movement is of this nature. For instance, when  Baha'u'llah was exiled from Persia with 'Abdu'l-Baha and the rest of His  family, they traveled the long road from Tihran to Ba_gh_dad, passing  through many towns and villages. During the whole of that journey and  distance they did not meet a single believer in the Cause for which they  had been banished. At that time very little was known about it in any part  of the world. Even in Ba_gh_dad there was but one believer who had been  taught by Baha'u'llah Himself in Persia. Later on, two or three others  appeared. You will see, therefore, that at the beginning the Cause of  Baha'u'llah was almost unknown, but on account of being a divine Movement  it grew and developed with irresistible spiritual power until in this day,  wherever you travel--East or West--and in whatever country you journey, you  will meet Baha'i assemblies and institutions. This is an evidence that the  Baha'is are spreading the blessings of unity and progressive development  throughout the world under the direction of divine guidance and purpose,  while other"]]]
