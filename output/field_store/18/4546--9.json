[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19846"],[0,"Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, \"Bulgaria\" to \"Calgary\" (#12)"],[1," the Slavonic group. In its groundwork it  presents the nearest approach to the old ecclesiastical Slavonic, the  liturgical language common to all the Orthodox Slavs, but it has undergone  more important modifications than any of the sister dialects in the  simplification of its grammatical forms; and the analytical character of  its development may be compared with that of the neo-Latin and Germanic  languages. The introduction of the definite article, which appears in the  form of a suffix, and the almost total disappearance of the ancient  declensions, for which the use of [v.04 p.0785] prepositions has been  substituted, distinguish the Bulgarian from all the other members of the  Slavonic family. Notwithstanding these changes, which give the language an  essentially modern aspect, its close affinity with the ecclesiastical  Slavonic, the oldest written dialect, is regarded as established by several  eminent scholars, such as [vS]afa[vr]ik, Schleicher, Leskien and Brugman,  and by many Russian philologists. These authorities agree in describing the  liturgical language as \"Old Bulgarian.\" A different view, however, is  maintained by Miklosich, Kopitar and some others, who regard it as \"Old  Slovene.\" According to the more generally accepted theory, the dialect  spoken by the Bulgarian population in the neighbourhood of Salonica, the  birthplace of SS. Cyril and Methodius, was employed by the Slavonic  apostles in their translations from the Greek, which formed the model for  subsequent ecclesiastical literature. This view receives support from the  fact that the two nasal vowels of the Church-Slavonic (the greater and  lesser _us_), which have been modified in all the cognate languages except  Polish, retain their original pronunciation locally in the neighbourhood of  Salonica and Castoria; in modern literary Bulgarian the _rhinesmus_ has  disappeared, but the old nasal vowels preserve a peculiar pronunciation,  the greater _us_ changing to _[)u]_, as in English \"but,\" the lesser to  _[)e]_, as in \"bet,\" while in Servian, Russian and Slovene the greater _us_  becomes _[=u]_ or _[=o]_, the lesser _e_ or _ya_. The remnants of the  declensions still existing in Bulgarian (mainly in pronominal and adverbial  forms) show a close analogy to those of the old ecclesiastical language.    The Slavonic apostles wrote in the 9th century (St Cyril died in 869, St  Methodius in 885), but the original manuscripts have not been preserved.  The oldest existing copies, which date from the 10th century, already  betray the influence of the contemporary vernacular speech, but as the  alterations introduced by the copyists are neither constant nor regular, it  is possible to reconstruct the original language with tolerable certainty.  The \"Old Bulgarian,\" or archaic Slavonic, was an inflexional language of  the synthetic type, containing few foreign elements in its vocabulary. The  Christian terminology was, of course, mainly Greek; the Latin or German  words which occasionally occur were derived from Moravia and Pannonia,  where the two saints pursued their missionary labours. In course of time it  underwent considerable modifications, both phonetic and structural, in the  various Slavonic countries in which it became the liturgical language, and  the various MSS. are consequently classified as \"Servian-Slavonic,\"  \"Croatian-Slavonic,\" \"Russian-Slavonic,\" &c., according to the different  recensions. The \"Russian-Slavonic\" is the liturgical language now in  general use among the Orthodox Slavs of the Balkan Peninsula owing to the  great number of ecclesiastical books introduced from Russia in the 17th and  18th centuries; until comparatively recent times it was believed to be the  genuine language of the Slavonic apostles. Among the Bulgarians the spoken  language of the 9th century underwent important changes during the next  three hundred years. The influence of these changes gradually asserts  itself in the written language; in the period extending from the 12th to  the 15th century the writers still endeavoured to follow the archaic model,  but it is evident that the vernacular had already become widely different  from the speech of SS. Cyril and Methodius. The language of the MSS. of  this period is known as the \"Middle Bulgarian\"; it stands midway between  the old ecclesiastical Slavonic and the modern speech.    In the first half of the 16th century the characteristic features of the  modern language became apparent in the literary monuments. These features  undoubtedly displayed themselves at a much earlier period in the oral  speech; but the progress of their development has not yet been completely  investigated. Much light may be thrown on this subject by the examination  of many hitherto little-known manuscripts and by the scientific study of  the folk-songs. In addition to the employment of the article, the loss of  the noun-declensions, and the modification of the nasal vowels above  alluded to, the disappearance in pronunciation of the final vowels  _yer-golem_ and _yer-maluk_, the loss of the infinitive, and the increased  variety of the conjugations, distinguish the modern from the ancient  language. The suffix-article, which is derived from the demonstrative  pronoun, is a feature peculiar to the Bulgarian among Slavonic and to the  Rumanian among Latin languages. This and other points of resemblance  between these remotely related members of the Indo-European group are  shared by the Albanian, probably the representative of the old Illyrian  language, and have consequently been attributed to the influence of the  aboriginal speech of the Peninsula. A demonstrative suffix, however, is  sometimes found in Russian and Polish, and traces of the article in an  embryonic state occur in the \"Old Bulgarian\" MSS. of the 10th and 11th  centuries. In some Bulgarian dialects it assumes different forms according  to the proximity or remoteness of the object mentioned. Thus _zhena-ta_ is  \"the woman\"; _zhena-va_ or _zhena-sa_, \"the woman close by\"; _zhena-na_,  \"the woman yonder.\" In the borderland between the Servian and Bulgarian  nationalities the local use of the article supplies the means of drawing an  ethnological frontier; it is nowhere more marked than in the immediate  neighbourhood of the Servian population, as, for instance, at Dibra and  Prilep. The modern Bulgarian has admitted many foreign elements. It  contains about 2000 Turkish and 1000 Greek words dispersed in the various  dialects; some Persian and Arabic words have entered through the Turkish  medium, and a few Rumanian and Albanian words are found. Most of these are  rejected by the purism of the literary language, which, however, has been  compelled to borrow the phraseology of modern civilization from the  Russian, French and other European languages. The dialects spoken in the  kingdom may be classed in two groups--the eastern and the western. The main  point of difference is the pronunciation of the letter _yedvoino_, which in  the eastern has frequently the sound of _ya_, in the western invariably  that of _e_ in \"pet.\" The literary language began in the western dialect  under the twofold influence of Servian literature and the Church Slavonic.  In a short time, however, the eastern dialect prevailed, and the influence  of Russian literature became predominant. An anti-Russian reaction was  initiated by Borgoroff (1818-1892), and has been maintained by numerous  writers educated in the German and Austrian universities. Since the  foundation of the university of Sofia the literary language has taken a  middle course between the ultra-Russian models of the past generation and  the dialectic Bulgarian. Little uniformity, however, has yet been attained  in regard to diction, orthography or pronunciation.    The Bulgarians of pagan times are stated by the monk Khrabr, a contemporary  of Tsar Simeon, to have employed a peculiar writing, of which inscriptions  recently found near Kaspitchan may possibly be specimens. The earliest  manuscripts of the \"Old Bulgarian\" are written in one or other of the two  alphabets known as the glagolitic and Cyrillic (see SLAVS). The former was  used by Bulgarian writers concurrently with the Cyrillic down to the 12th  century. Among the orthodox Slavs the Cyrillic finally superseded the  glagolitic; as modified by Peter the Great it became the Russian alphabet,  which, with the revival of literature, was introduced into Servia and  Bulgaria. Some Russian letters which are superfluous in Bulgarian have been  abandoned by the native writers, and a few characters have been restored  from the ancient alphabet.    _Literature._--The ancient Bulgarian literature, originating in the works  of SS. Cyril and Methodius and their disciples, consisted for the most part  of theological works translated from the Greek. From the conversion of  Boris down to the Turkish conquest the religious character predominates,  and the influence of Byzantine literature is supreme. Translations of the  gospels and epistles, lives of the saints, collections of sermons, exegetic  religious works, translations of Greek chronicles, and miscellanies such as  the _Sbornik_ of St Sviatoslav, formed the staple of the national  literature. In the time of Tsar Simeon, himself an author, considerable  literary activity prevailed; among the more remarkable works of this period  was the _Shestodnev_, or Hexameron, of John the exarch, an account of the  creation. A little later the heresy of the Bogomils gave an impulse to  controversial writing. The principal champions of orthodoxy were St Kosmas  and the monk Athanas of Jerusalem; among the Bogomils the _Questions of St  Ivan Bogosloff_, a work containing a description of the beginning and the  end of the world, was held in high esteem. Contemporaneously with the  spread of this sect a number of apocryphal works, based on the Scripture  narrative, but embellished with Oriental legends of a highly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19850"],[0,"The Human Side of Animals (#12)"],[1," of the  first order, and knows how to fight far better than the average bull  terrier. It requires a very savage dog to kill her, and he is apt to be  minus an ear when the battle is over.    Red and grey foxes are similar in intelligence, but differ in many other  ways: the former are like the gipsies in always moving about from place  to place, while the latter stick to one general locality, although their  hunting-grounds may range for several miles in all directions. Red foxes  seem actually to enjoy being hunted by dogs; in most cases they will  outrun the dogs, and rarely seek protection from caves or rocks.    The grey fox, on the other hand, cares little for racing, but seeks  protection among rocky cliffs where the dogs are at a disadvantage. Here  none but the smallest canines may enter the holes and crannies, and they  are usually wise enough to stay out. Hunters are thoroughly familiar  with the tactics of the fox family, and therefore select the red ones  for their sport.    The foxes are truly famed for their cunning, and when other animals try  to play tricks on them, the trick usually turns out in the foxes'  favour. During the winter season these wise creatures are sometimes hard  pressed for food. Birds and small animals are hard to catch, and the  farmers' chicken houses are closed. It is then that the wise fox needs  all his wit and wisdom, for he oftentimes becomes the hunted as well as  the hunter. His chief enemies are the puma and the timber wolf, but they  are seldom able to get him.    The prairie-dog is so talented that he might be classed under several  headings; he is sociable, a burrower, and especially gifted in the art  of constructing underground \"dog towns.\" He is rarely called by his  Indian name, _Wish-ton-wish_, and we know him only as the prairie-dog.  Evidently he was given this name because of his yelping bark, which  resembles the cry of a young domestic dog.    He is a good-looking but rather curious little animal. He has a round,  flat head, and garish-red fur, and a stout little body. He makes an  affectionate pet, and loves the society of human beings. When he decides  to start a town, he usually succeeds, for he is an exceedingly prolific  animal, and his extensive burrows seem to have no ends. They are rather  large, and run to great depths. In the western part of the United  States, especially on the big prairies, the prairie-dog towns often  cover large areas. They are usually dug in a sloping direction, and  descend four to six feet in depth, and then suddenly rise upward again.  Hundreds of these little tunnels are dug in such close proximity to each  other that it is quite unsafe for cattle and horses to pass over them.  This is the chief reason why ranchmen do not like the otherwise harmless  little animals of the prairies.    These dog towns are most curious, and a visit to one of them well repays  the traveller. Strangely enough, the prairie-dog is exceedingly  inquisitive and this very quality often costs the little animal his  life. Mr. Wood, in describing the prairie-dog's habits, says that this  wise little Westerner, when perched on the hillocks which we have  already described, is able to survey a wide extent of territory and as  soon as he sees a visitor, he gives a loud yelp of alarm, and dives into  his burrow, his tiny feet knocking together with a ludicrous flourish as  he disappears. In every direction similar scenes are enacted. The  warning cry has been heard, and immediately every dog within a hundred  yards repeats the cry and leaps into his burrow. Their curiosity,  however, cannot be suppressed, and no sooner have they vanished from  sight than their heads are seen protruding from their burrows. Sometimes  hundreds of them will be peeping from their homes at one time, their  beautiful eyes sparkling as they cautiously watch the enemy's every  movement.    The prairie-dog is truly a tenement dweller, and his home is occupied  not only by his own kind, but by owls and rattlesnakes. Most naturalists  believe that these incongruous families live in perfect harmony; but it  is a well-known fact that the snake occasionally devours the young  prairie-dogs, and he must be considered by them as an intruder who  procured board and lodging without their consent. The owls, on the other  hand, are supposed to do no harm, although it may be that they also  occasionally feast on a tender young pup.    The magnificent little animals known to scientists as vizcachas, and  whose homes are on the pampas of South America, are the most skilled  builders of underground cities in the animal world. Their villages or  cities are called \"vizcacheras\" and are provided with from ten to twenty  mouths or subway entrances, with one entrance often serving for several  holes. If the ground is soft, it is not uncommon to find twenty to  thirty burrows in a vizcachera; but if the ground is rocky and hard,  only four or five burrows are found. These wide-mouthed, gaping burrows  are dug close together, and the entire town usually covers from one  hundred to two hundred square feet.    The vizcacheras are different from other underground animal cities; some  of the burrows are large, others are small. Most of them open into a  subterranean main-street at from four to six feet from the entrance;  from this street other streets wind and turn in all directions, like a  man-made subway, and many of them extend clear into other streets or  subways, thus forming a complete network of underground passageways. All  the tunnelled-out dirt is brought to the surface and forms a large mound  to prevent the water from entering the cities.    According to W. H. Hudson, in _The Naturalist in La Plata_, \"in some  directions a person might ride five hundred miles and never advance half  a mile without seeing one or more of them. In districts where, as far as  the eye can see, the plains are as level and smooth as a bowling-green,  especially in winter when the grass is close-cropped, and where the  rough giant-thistle has not sprung up, these mounds appear like brown or  dark spots on a green surface. They are the only irregularities that  occur to catch the eye, and consequently form an important feature in  the scenery. In some places they are so near together that a person on  horseback may count a hundred of them from one point of view.\"    Unlike some burrowing animals, the vizcacha does not select a spot where  there is a bank or depression in the soil, or roots of trees, or even  tall grass; knowing that they only attract the opossum, skunk,  armadillo, and weasel, he chooses an open level plot of ground where he  can watch in all directions for enemies while he works.    The great or main entrance to some of these underground cities is  sometimes four to six feet in diameter. A small man stands shoulder deep  in them. The going and coming of these little vizcachas would almost  lead one to believe that they have a primitive city government, and are  ruled according to definite laws. Their cities stand for generations,  and many of the old human inhabitants tell of certain vizcacheras around  them which existed when their parents were living. The founder of a new  village is usually a male; and he goes only a short distance from the  other villages to establish his new colony.    These cities are by no means occupied by their builders alone, but have  their undesirables within their borders. The unique style of burrowing  which the vizcachas employ benefits several kinds of birds, especially  the Minerva, and one species of the swallows, which build their nests in  the bank-like holes in the sides of the vizcacha's cities. Several  insects, among which may be mentioned a large nocturnal bug, with red  wings and shiny black body, also seek the same shelter; another foreign  inhabitant is a night-roaming cincindela, with dark green wing-cases and  pale red legs, which remind one of oriental jewels. There are also no  less than six species of wingless wasps, beautifully coloured in red,  black, and white. Dozens of spiders and smaller insects that live in and  near the vizcacheras, which are everywhere sprinkled over the pampas,  pass in and out among the streets recognising their respective friends  and enemies.    The home life in these communities is most interesting. The burrowers  remain indoors until late in the evening during the winter, but in  summer appear before the sun sets. One of the larger males is the first  to appear, as if to see if everything is safe from danger; if it is,  others immediately pop up and take their places at the entrance to the  burrow. The females are smaller than the males, and stand up that they  may see everything that happens. Curiosity struggling within them for  mastery is often the cause of their death. Tiny swallows hover over the  entrances, like myriads of large moths, with never-ending low, mournful  cries.    Of all the incongruous inhabitants of the vizcacheras, the fox is the  most dreaded and the least welcome. To appease his growls and snarls the  vizcachas are sometimes forced to let him occupy one of their rooms for  a season, or even permanently. During a part of the year he appears  quite unassuming and indifferent to the general affairs of the  household, and he really goes quite unnoticed, even though he may be  sitting on the mound in the family group. But when the vizcachas appear  in the spring, the fox begins to become interested in the nursery and as  soon as the older animals are away he devours the young. Occasionally,  if the fox is hungry, or if he has another friend to aid him, he will  hunt the vizcachera from end to end, battling with the old, and usually  killing all the young. It often happens that the mother vizcacha, when  her babes are large enough to follow her, will take them away to another  place that is safer.    The language of these city-builders is most unusual; the males  frequently utter the most"]]]
