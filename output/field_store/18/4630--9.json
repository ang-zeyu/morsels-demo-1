Mr. Grote's history has yet arrived only at the close of the fourth  century B.C., and the fall of the Thirty Tyrants. Two of the six  compartments in which he proposes, to use his own quaint phrase, \"to  exhaust the free life of collective Hellas,\" still remain to be  accomplished. But the history of Greece is written. Stirring events and  great names are still to come; the romantic enterprise of Cyrus and the  retreat of the Ten Thousand, the elective trust of Thebes, and the  chivalrous glories of her one great man. Demosthenes has yet to prove  how vain is the divinest eloquence when poured to degenerate hearts.  Agis and Cleomenes have yet to exhibit the spectacle, ever fraught with  melancholy interest, of noble natures out of harmony with the present,  and spending their energies in the vain attempt to turn back the stream  of time and call again into existence the feelings and the institutions  of an irrevocable past. The monarchy of Philip is yet due to fate.  Macedon is still to Greece what Russia, before Peter the Great, was to  Europe--a half-unknown and barbarous land, full of latent energy and  power, and waiting for the rise of a master mind to discern its embryo  greatness and turn its peasants into the unconquerable phalanx.  Alexander must arise to carry forth with his victorious arms the seeds  of Greek civilization over the Eastern world. Aristotle must arise to  gather up in one boundless mind the vast results of Greek philosophy,  and found an empire vaster and more enduring than that of his great  pupil in the subjugated intellect of man. But the history of Greece is  finished. Athens and Sparta, the two great antagonistic types of Greek  society, politics, and education, have attained their full development,  passed their allotted hour of trial, and touched upon their doom. The  shades of night are gathering on the bright day of Hellas. The momentous  work of that wonderful people is accomplished; the interest of the great  intellectual and moral contest has centred in one man; the last scene of  the _Phaedo_ has been enacted, and Socrates has died.    The history of Greece is written, and the character of the historian is  decided. Mr. Grote has achieved a noble work--a work which, unless the  glory of classical literature is a dream, will well repay, in usefulness  and in renown, the devotion of a scholars life. His book will be called  great while Grecian story retains its interest. Even making allowance  for the wonderful labors of the Germans and the extraordinary addition  which their learned toils have made to our knowledge of the subject, we  should say that the work before us has almost disentombed many portions  of Greek life. We cannot sufficiently extol the wonderful knowledge of  all the feelings, habits, associations, and institutions of an extinct  people which every page exhibits, and the familiar mastery with which a  mind steeped in Grecian lore analyzes, combines, criticizes, and unfolds  the mass of heterogeneous and often conjectural materials on which it  has to work. Not only have we been enabled to read Greek history with  new eyes and a new understanding, but light has been poured upon its  literature; and, to apply to Mr. Grote the compliment he pays to others,  \"the poets, historians, orators, and philosophers of Greece have been  all rendered both more intelligible and more instructive to the student,  and the general picture of the Grecian world may now be conceived with a  degree of fidelity which, considering our imperfect materials, it is  curious to contemplate.\" Two volumes more at least must be yet to come,  but Mr. Grote's pedestal is sure; and nothing can diminish the  satisfaction he must now feel at his decided and proclaimed success but  the consciousness that the moment is approaching when he must part with  the companion of many a sweet though toilsome hour, and experience the  mingled feelings which Gibbon has so well portrayed in writing \"the last  page of the last chapter\" of the history of Greece.    It is pity that such high intrinsic merits should be marred, both as  regards the pleasure and the instruction of the reader, by a fatal  deficiency of style. It is pity, but it is true. Mr. Grote seems to have  lived in the works of the Greek writers till he has almost forgotten the  forms and cadence of his mother tongue. It is not only that he so  frequently has resort to an uncouth Greek compound when he might easily  express the same idea in two or three English words, if not one; there  is a perpetual clumsiness in his construction of common sentences and  his use of common words. Clarendon himself is not harder or more  tortuous. Even in purely narrative parts, which ought to flow most  easily, the understanding of the reader can seldom keep pace with his  eye. Cyclopean epithets are piled together almost at random on any  substantive which will have the complaisance to receive them. The choice  of expression and metaphor is sometimes such as almost to rival the  achievements of Castlereagh in his happiest hour. We have people  existing, \"not as individual names on paper, but simply as an  imposturous nominal aggregate,\"--Thucydides \"reserving his flowers to  strew on the grave of Nicias,\"--the Athenians \"sailing out\" to action,  having \"left their sails at Teichiassa,\" and their \"sailing back\" to  Teichiassa for their sails,--Athens, \"the mistress and successor of the  Ionian Confederacy,\"--inestimable stepping-stones toward a goal, and  oligarchical conspirators against popular liberty \"tying down the  patient while the process of emasculation was being consummated.\" We are  sorry to say that these instances are taken from the last two volumes,  so that Mr. Grote does not improve as he advances. In the first volume,  when relating the legends of early Greece, we are glad he does not  imitate the forced simplicity with which Dr. Arnold tells the legends of  early Rome; but it is too flat to describe Atalanta as \"beautiful and  matchless for swiftness of foot, but living in the forest as a huntress,  and unacceptable to Aphrodite.\" The redeeming point, and a great  redeeming point it is, is the total absence of anything like  affectation. All the peculiarities are genuine, and everything that is  genuine in composition, though it cannot be admired, may be borne. But  for this we should be compelled to class one of the best of English  books among the very worst of English writings. Mr. Grote must remember  that no man who writes for posterity can afford to neglect the art of  composition. The trimmer bark, though less richly laden, will float  further down the stream of time, and when so many authors of real  ability and learning are competing for every niche in the temple of  fame, the coveted place will certainly be won by style.    It is this deficiency of art which can alone prevent Mr. Grote's history  from completely superseding both the works already existing of the same  magnitude. Neither the spirit of Mitford nor the solid sense of  Thirlwall could long preserve them from eclipse. The light of the former  indeed has long grown dim. He is always blundering, and his blunders are  always on the Tory side. Arnold's good word has kept him a few years  longer on our bookshelves. Dr. Thirlwall has higher qualities, but, not  to mention that he has damaged himself by writing against Mitford  instead of ignoring him, he is terribly dry, and Mr. Grote leaves him  far behind in appreciation of all that belongs to Greece, in loving  industry, in warmth of sympathy, and, well read scholars as they both  are, in deep knowledge of his subject. The cheaper and more compendious  histories of course are not affected.

Mr.  Briggerland breathed a little more quickly as he felt the strength of  the patient's biceps.    \"My conviction,\" said Dr. Thun seriously, \"was due to the fact that  women were sitting on the court martial, which is, of course, against  all regulations.\"    \"Certainly,\" murmured Mr. Briggerland.    \"Keeping me here,\" Thun went on, \"is part of the plot of the Italian  government. Naturally, they do not wish me to get at my enemies, who I  have every reason to believe are in London.\"    Mr. Briggerland drew a long breath.    \"They are in London,\" he said a little hoarsely. \"I happen to know where  they are.\"    \"Really?\" said the other easily, and then a cloud passed over his face  and he shook his head.    \"They are safe from my vengeance,\" he said a little sadly. \"As long as  they keep me in this place pretending that I am mad, there is no  possible chance for me.\"    The visitor looked round and saw that the three men who were following  were out of ear shot.    \"Suppose I came to-morrow night,\" he said, lowering his voice, \"and  helped you to get away? What is your ward?\"    \"No. 6,\" said the other in the same tone. His eyes were blazing.    \"Do you think you will remember?\" asked Briggerland.    Thun nodded.    \"You will come to-morrow night--No. 6, the first cubicle on the left,\"  he whispered, \"you will not fail me? If I thought you'd fail me----\" His  eyes lit up again.    \"I shall not fail you,\" said Mr. Briggerland hastily. \"When the clock  strikes twelve you may expect me.\"    \"You must be Marshal Foch,\" murmured Thun, and then with all a madman's  cunning, changed the conversation as the doctor and attendants, who had  noticed his excitement, drew nearer. \"Believe me, Mr. Briggerland,\" he  went on airily, \"the strategy of the Allies was at fault until I took up  the command of the army....\"    Ten minutes later Mr. Briggerland was in his car driving homeward, a  little breathless, more than a little terrified at the unpleasant task  he had set himself; jubilant, too, at his amazing success.    Jean had said he might have to visit a dozen asylums before he found his  opportunity and the right man, and he had succeeded at the first  attempt. Yet--he shuddered at the picture he conjured--that climb over  the high wall (he had already located the ward, for he had followed the  General and the attendants and had seen him safely put away), the  midnight association with a madman....    He burst in upon Jean with his news.    \"At the first attempt, my dear, what do you think of that?\" His dark  face glowed with almost childish pride, and she looked at him with a  half-smile.    \"I thought you would,\" she said quietly. \"That's the rough work done, at  any rate.\"    \"The rough work!\" he said indignantly.    She nodded.    \"Half the difficulty is going to be to cover up your visit to the  asylum, because this man is certain to mention your name, and it will  not all be dismissed as the imagination of a madman. Now I think I will  make my promised call upon Mrs. Meredith.\"          Chapter XIII      There was one thing which rather puzzled and almost piqued Lydia  Meredith, and that was the failure of Jean Briggerland's prophecy to  materialise. Jean had said half jestingly that Jack Glover would be a  frequent visitor at the flat; in point of fact, he did not come at all.  Even when she visited the offices of Rennett, Glover and Simpson, it was  Mr. Rennett who attended to her, and Jack was invisible. Mr. Rennett  sometimes explained that he was at the courts, for Jack did all the  court work, sometimes that he had gone home.    She caught a glimpse of him once as she was driving past the Law Courts  in the Strand. He was standing on the pavement talking to a be-wigged  counsel, so possibly Mr. Rennett had not stated more than the truth when  he said that the young man's time was mostly occupied by the processes  of litigation.    She was curious enough to look through the telephone directory to  discover where he lived. There were about fifty Glovers, and ten of  these were John Glovers, and she was enough of a woman to call up six of  the most likely only to discover that her Mr. Glover was not amongst  them. She did not know till later that his full name was Bertram John  Glover, or she might have found his address without difficulty.    Mrs. Morgan had now arrived, to Lydia's infinite relief, and had taken  control of the household affairs. The new maid was as perfect as a new  maid could be, and but for the nightly intrusion of the taciturn Jaggs,  to whom, for some reason, Mrs. Morgan took a liking, the current of her  domestic life ran smoothly.    She was already becoming accustomed to the possession of wealth. The  habit of being rich is one of the easiest acquired, and she found  herself negotiating for a little house in Curzon Street and a more  pretentious establishment in Somerset, with a sangfroid which astonished  and frightened her.    The purchase and arrival of her first car, and the engagement of her  chauffeur had been a thrilling experience. It was incredible, too, that  her new bankers should, without hesitation, deliver to her enormous sums  of money at the mere affixing of her signature to an oblong slip of  paper.    She had even got over the panic feeling which came to her on her first  few visits to the bank. On these earlier occasions she had felt rather  like an inexpert forger, who was endeavouring to get money by false  pretence, and it was both a relief and a wonder to her when the  nonchalant cashier thrust thick wads of bank-notes under the grille,  without so much as sending for a policeman.    \"It's a lovely flat,\" said Jean Briggerland, looking round the pink  drawing-room approvingly, \"but of course, my dear, this is one that was  already furnished for you. I'm dying to see what you will make of your  own home when you get one.\"    She had telephoned that morning to Lydia saying that she was paying a  call, asking if it was convenient, and the two girls were alone.    \"It _is_ a nice flat, and I shall be sorry to leave it,\" agreed Lydia.  \"It is so extraordinarily quiet. I sleep like a top. There is no noise  to disturb one, except that there was rather an unpleasant happening the  other morning.\"    \"What was that?\" asked Jean, stirring her tea.    \"I don't know really what happened,\" said Lydia. \"I heard an awful  groaning very early in the morning and I got up and looked out of the  window. There were two men in the courtyard. One, I think, had hurt  himself very badly. I never discovered what happened.\"    \"They must have been workmen, I should think,\" said Jean, \"or else they  were drunk. Personally, I have never liked taking furnished flats,\" she  went on. \"One always breaks things, and there's such a big bill to pay  at the end. And then I always lose the keys. One usually has two or  three. You should be very careful about that, my dear, they make an  enormous charge for lost keys,\" she prattled on.    \"I think the house agent gave me three,\" said Lydia. She walked to her  little secretaire, opened it and pulled out a drawer.    \"Yes, three,\" she said, \"there is one here, one I carry, and Mrs. Morgan  has one.\"    \"Have you seen Jack Glover lately?\"    Jean never pursued an enquiry too far, by so much as one syllable.    \"No, I haven't seen him,\" smiled Lydia, \"You weren't a good prophet.\"    \"I expect he is busy,\" said the girl carelessly. \"I think I could like  Jack awfully--if he hadn't such a passion for ordering people about. How  careless of me!\" She had tipped over her teacup and its contents were  running across the little tea table. She pulled out her handkerchief  quickly and tried to stop the flow.    \"Oh, please, please don't spoil your beautiful handkerchief,\" said  Lydia, rising hurriedly, \"I will get a duster.\"    She ran out of the room and was back almost immediately, to find Jean  standing with her back to the secretaire examining the ruins of her late  handkerchief with a smile.    \"Let me put your handkerchief in water or it will be stained,\" said  Lydia, putting out her hand.    \"I would rather do it myself,\" laughed Jean Briggerland, and pushed the  handkerchief into her bag.    There were many reasons why Lydia should not handle that flimsy piece of  cambric and lace, the most important of which was the key which Jean had  taken from the secretaire in Lydia's absence, and had rolled inside the  tea-stained handkerchief.    A few days later Mr. Bertram John Glover interviewed a high official at  Scotland Yard, and the interview was not a particularly satisfactory one  to the lawyer. It might have been worse, had not the police commissioner  been a friend of Jack's partner.    The official listened patiently whilst the lawyer, with professional  skill, marshalled all his facts, attaching to them the suspicions which  had matured to convictions.    \"I have sat in this chair for twenty-five years,\" said the head of the  C.I.D., \"and I have heard stories which beat the best and the worst of  detective stories hollow. I have listened to cranks, amateur detectives,  crooks, parsons and expert fictionists, but never in my experience have  I ever heard anything quite so improbable as your theory. It happens  that I have met Briggerland and I've met his daughter too, and a more  beautiful girl I don't think it has been my pleasure to meet.\"    Jack groaned.    \"Aren't you feeling well?\" asked the chief unpleasantly.    \"I'm all right, sir,\" said Jack, \"only I'm so tired of hearing about  Jean Briggerland's beauty. It doesn't seem a very good argument to  oppose to the facts--\"    \"Fac"]]]
