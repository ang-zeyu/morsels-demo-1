On the other hand,  each pilgrim brings back information and suggestions of a most precious  character, and it is the privilege of all the friends to share in the  spiritual results of these visits.\"            148: PIONEERING      \"...Sometimes people strive all their lives to render outstanding service.  Here is the time and opportunity to render historic services; in fact the  most unique in history, aiding in the fulfillment of Daniel's Prophecies  of the Last Day, and the 1335 days, when men are to be blessed by the  Glory of the Lord, covering the entire globe--which is the real goal of  the Ten Year Crusade.    \"In other words, when we fulfill the Ten Year Crusade we will have brought  into fulfillment Daniel's great prophecy of 'Blessed is he who waits and  comes to the 1335 days.' What could be more wonderful than taking part in  the fulfillment of religious prophecy of over 3,000 years!\"    \"The pioneers themselves must realize that not only are they fulfilling  the wishes of Baha'u'llah, and doing that which the Master Himself said He  longed to do; namely, to go, if necessary on foot, and carry His Father's  Message to all the regions of the earth; but they are enhancing the  prestige of the Faith to a remarkable degree in the eyes of the public,  and specially in the eyes of the officials. There is no doubt that the  rapid forward march of the Faith recently has attracted a far greater  measure of attention on the part of the thoughtful people, and people of  position in society and in educational fields, than has been the case for  almost one hundred years.    \"Therefore, each pioneer must feel his responsibility very heavily, and  understand that his calling is far above the average service; and his duty  to remain at his post a very pressing one indeed.\"            149: POLITICAL FIGURES (NON-POLITICAL CHARACTER OF THE BAHA'I FAITH)      \"The Guardian wishes me to draw the attention of the friends through you  that they should be very careful in their public utterance not to mention  any political figures ... either side with them or denounce them. This is  the first thing to bear in mind. Otherwise they will involve the friends  in political matters, which is definitely dangerous for the Cause.\"            150: POLITICS (LOYALTY TO WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH)      \"Loyalty (to the) World Order of Baha'u'llah, security of its basic  institutions, both imperatively demand all its avowed supporters ... in  these days when sinister uncontrollable forces are deepening (the)  cleavage sundering peoples, nations, creeds (and) classes, (to) resolve,  despite (the) pressure (of) fast crystallizing public opinion, (to)  abstain individually and collectively, in word (and) action, informally as  well as in all official utterances and publications, from assigning blame,  taking sides, however indirectly, in recurring political crises now  agitating (and) ultimately engulfing human society. Grave apprehension  lest cumulative effect (of) such compromises (should) disintegrate (the)  fabric, clog (the) channel of grace that sustains (the) system of God's  essentially supranational, supernatural order so laboriously evolved, so  recently established.\"            151: POLITICS (NON-INTERFERENCE IN)      \"The attitude of the Baha'is must be two-fold, complete obedience to the  government of the country they reside in, and no interference whatsoever  in political matters or questions. What the Master's statement really  means is obedience to a duly constituted government, whatever that  government may be in form. We are not the ones, as individual Baha'is, to  judge our government as just or unjust--for each believer would be sure to  hold a different viewpoint, and within our own Baha'i fold a hotbed of  dissension would spring up and destroy our unity. We must build up our own  Baha'i system, and leave the faulty systems of the world to go their way.  We cannot change them through becoming involved in them; on the contrary,  they will destroy us.\"            152: POLITICS (REMAIN ALOOF FROM POLITICAL AFFAIRS)      \"We should--every one of us--remain aloof, in heart and in mind, in words  and in deeds, from the political affairs and disputes of the Nations and  of Governments. We should keep ourselves away from such thoughts. We  should have no political connection with any of the parties and should  join no faction of these different and warring sects.    \"Absolute impartiality in the matter of political parties should be shown  by words and by deeds, and the love of the whole humanity, whether a  Government or a nation, which is the basic teaching of Baha'u'llah, should  also be shown by words and by deeds...    \"According to the exhortations of the Supreme Pen and the confirmatory  explanations of the Covenant of God Baha'is are in no way allowed to enter  into political affairs under any pretense of excuse; since such an action  brings about disastrous results and ends in hurting the Cause of God and  its intimate friends.\"            153: POLITICS (SHUN POLITICS LIKE THE PLAGUE)      \"The cardinal principle which we must follow ... is obedience to the  government prevailing in any land in which we reside....    \"We see therefore that we must do two things--Shun politics like the  plague, and be obedient to the Government in power in the place where we  reside... We must obey in all cases except where a spiritual principle is  involved, such as denying our Faith. For these spiritual principles we  must be willing to die. What we Baha'is must face is the fact that society  is disintegrating so rapidly that moral issues which were clear a half  century ago are now hopelessly confused and what is more, thoroughly mixed  up with battling political interests. That is why the Baha'is must turn  all their forces into the channel of building up the Baha'i Cause and its  Administration. They can neither change nor help the world in any other  way at present. If they become involved in the issues the Governments of  the world are struggling over, they will be lost. But if they build up the  Baha'i pattern they can offer it as a remedy when all else has failed.\"            154: PRAYER (FIVE STEPS OF)      \"Regarding the five steps of prayer outlined by the Guardian, and recorded  by Mrs. Moffett in her booklet, the 'Call to Prayer', these, he wishes me  to explain, are merely personal suggestions and need not, therefore, be  adopted strictly and universally by the believers.\"            155: PRAYER BEADS      \"In the matter of the use and distribution of prayer beads, in this and  other matters of secondary importance he does not wish that any hard and  fast rules be set up. The believers should not be required to use prayer  beads, nor should they be prevented from doing so, as the Teachings do not  contain any specific instruction on the subject.\"            156: PRAYER (BAHA'U'LLAH'S IN DISPENSATION)      \"The names of those cited in Baha'u'llah's Prayer in the Dispensation are  quite correct as you gave them, (Abraham, Moses, Joseph, John the Baptist,  Christ, Muhammad, Imam Husayn, the Bab and Baha'u'llah.)    \"The Prophets 'regarded as one and the same person' include the lesser  Prophets as well, and not merely those who bring a 'Book'. The station is  different, but They are Prophets and Their nature thus different from that  of ours.    \"In the prayer mentioned above Baha'u'llah identifies Himself with Imam  Husayn. This does not make him a Prophet, but his position was very  unique, and we know Baha'u'llah claims to be the 'return' of the Imam  Husayn. He, in other words, identifies His Spirit with these Holy Souls  gone before, that does not, of course, make Him in any way their  re-incarnation. Nor does it mean all of them were Prophets.\"            157: PRAYERS      \"You have asked whether our prayers go beyond Baha'u'llah; It all depends  whether we pray to Him directly or through Him to God. We may do both, and  also can pray directly to God, but our prayers would certainly be more  effective and illuminating if they are addressed to Him through His  Manifestation Baha'u'llah.    \"Under no circumstances, however, can we, while repeating the prayers,  insert the name Baha'u'llah where the word 'God' is used. This would be  tantamount to blasphemy.\"    \"In quoting prayers any part may be used, but should be quoted as it is,  however short.\"            158: PRAYERS AND MEDITATIONS (BOOK OF)      \"He is indeed pleased to know that the Book of Prayers and Meditations by  Baha'u'llah has been out in time to enable the friends to read it during  the Fast, and he has every hope that the perusal of such a precious volume  will help to deepen more than any other publication, the spirit of  devotion and faith in the friends, and thus charge them with all the  spiritual power they require for the accomplishment of their tremendous  duties towards the Cause...\"            159: PRAYERS (DAILY)      \"The daily prayers are to be said each one for himself, aloud or silent  makes no difference. There is no congregational prayer except that for the  dead. We read healing and other prayers in our meetings, but the daily  prayer is a personal obligation, so someone else reading it is not quite  the same thing as saying it for yourself.    \"If you find you need to visualize someone when you pray, think of the  Master. Through Him you can address Baha'u'llah. Gradually try to think of  the qualities of the Manifestation, and in that way a mental form will  fade out, for after all the body is not the thing, His Spirit is there and  is the essential, everlasting element.\"            160: PRAYERS (DAILY OBLIGATORY)      \"The daily obligatory prayers are three in number. The shortest one  consists of a single verse which has to be recited once in every  twenty-four hours and at midday. The medium (prayer) which begins with the  words: 'Th"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19271"],[0,"Dawn of a New Day (#12)"],[1,"religious  freedom. Similar orders were issued to the believers in all other parts of  Persia, with the result that today the friends find their activities in  Persia completely paralyzed. Their schools have all been definitely  closed, their meetings suspended, their correspondence intercepted, and  their assemblies and committees for the most part dissolved.    The situation, as it stands at present, is highly disconcerting. The  friends, however, faithful to the injunctions of the Master regarding  obedience to government in all administrative matters as distinguished  from those affecting their conscience and loyalty to the Cause strictly  adhere to the laws and orders of the government. Their sole hope is the  assurance that in due time all these restrictions are bound to  disappear....    In the meantime, the Guardian would urge all the friends to patiently and  prayerfully wait until these sad happenings take their due course. For the  history of the Cause, particularly in Persia, is a clear illustration of  the truth that such persecutions invariably serve to strengthen the  believers in their faith, by stimulating the spiritual powers latent in  their hearts, and by awakening in them a new and deeper consciousness of  their duties and responsibilities towards the Faith. Indeed, the mere  progress of the Cause, by provoking the hatreds and jealousies of peoples  and nations, creates for itself such difficulties and obstacles as only  its divine spirit can overcome. Abdu'l-Baha has emphatically stated that  the enmity and opposition of the world will increase in direct proportion  to the extension and progress of the Faith. The greater the zeal of the  believers and the more striking the effect of their achievements, the  fiercer will be the opposition of the enemy.    Many are the passages in the Writings of Baha'u'llah wherein He  foreshadows the persecutions awaiting His Faith. But side by side with  such emphatic predictions is the assurance that out of these sufferings  and trials His Cause will emerge triumphant and purified. May we not,  therefore, gather strength from such an assurance, and with hearts filled  with confident and joyous hope arise to fulfil our part in the  establishment of His Cause?    January 20, 1935          Training of Baha'i Teachers      With regard to the teaching outline you had enclosed, Shoghi Effendi has  read it with interest and appreciation and wishes me to assure you of his  whole-hearted approval. The method you have adopted for the training of  Baha'i teachers is, indeed, very similar to the one used by the American  friends. It is very thorough, yet clear and highly effective. The Guardian  trusts that the believers in India and Burma will make full use of your  Assembly's suggestions and directions, and in this way help in  inaugurating a new and effective teaching campaign throughout India and  Burma.    July 8, 1935          Registration of L.S.A. of Karachi      He has been particularly pleased and encouraged to receive the copy of the  Certificate of Registration of the Karachi Baha'i Assembly, and is eagerly  awaiting for the registration papers of the Delhi and Rangoon Spiritual  Assemblies. He hopes that the N.S.A. will expedite the matter of  legalizing all the Local Assemblies of India and Burma and in this way  insure the stability of the administrative institutions of the Cause in  these two countries.    August 12, 1935          Formation of an Assembly in Lahore      He is pleased to learn of the possibility of establishing an Assembly in  Lahore in the near future. He would urge you, and through you your  fellow-members in the N.S.A., to make a special effort to bring about such  a formation as soon as conditions are found to be favourable. He hopes  that the establishment of a local Assembly in so important and central a  town in India will greatly help the expansion of the Faith, and will  consolidate the foundations of its institutions throughout that country.    October 17, 1935 Historic Step in Development of Administrative Order    He wishes me to congratulate you, and through you your fellow-members in  the N.S.A., for the steps you have taken for the registration of the  Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon and other local Assemblies. He hopes that by the  end of the year six out of the eight Assemblies will be duly registered.  Needless to say that the obtention of such an official recognition from  the authorities is an historic step in the development of the  Administrative Order of the Faith throughout India and Burma, and one  which shall greatly enhance its prestige, and consolidate its position in  the eyes of the public. May Baha'u'llah continue to guide and assist your  efforts for the fulfilment of this task.    The Guardian is also very much gratified to learn that the N.S.A. is  considering the possibility of establishing a local Assembly in Lucknow.  He trusts that in Jaunpur too an Assembly will be formed very soon, and  that through these two valuable additions to the list of local Baha'i  Assemblies, the administrative work of the Cause in India will make  further and steady advancement.    In connection with the Teaching School which the N.S.A. is planning to  start, the Guardian wishes me to express his approval, as well as his  appreciation of this important action taken by your Assembly for the  extension of their teaching work. He is also very pleased at the news of  the teaching tour undertaken by Prof. Pritam Singh throughout Northern  India and Bengal. He is praying for the success of this trip, and  cherishes the hope that it may serve to bring into the Cause people of  capacity and of true spiritual vision.          Circulation of Abdu'l-Baha's Photographs      Regarding the use of Abdu'l-Baha's photographs; Shoghi Effendi sees no  objection to their circulation. He would, however, suggest that the Paris  photograph be used, as well as the American reproduction of it, printed on  yellow paper with a quotation from the Kitab-i-Ahd at the bottom.          Splendid Initiative      [From the Guardian:]    My heart swells with pride and gratitude as I witness, in rapid succession  and with ever-increasing dearness, the evidences of the splendid  initiative, the unwavering determination and solidarity which have  characterized your accomplishments in recent months. The National Assembly  of India and Burma may be said to have resuscitated our Cause and its  institutions throughout the length and breadth of that land. A mighty  power whose source is centred in Baha'u'llah Himself is copiously flowing  through and permeating the various organs of the Administrative Order of  His Faith in both India and Burma. You and your collaborators stand on the  threshold of unparalleled achievements. I cannot but congratulate you on  the start you have made and on your choice of the path, which, after so  many trials and vicissitudes, you are so confidently treading. Persevere,  and be happy and thankful to Baha'u'llah.    November 15, 1935          Baha'i Holidays must be Observed      The Guardian ... feels truly delighted at the news of the splendid  meetings that were held in Bombay in honour of the anniversary of the  birthday of His Holiness Baha'u'llah. This fresh evidence of the loyalty  and devotion with which the Bombay friends are upholding the institutions  of the Faith is highly gratifying and encouraging to him, indeed.    But he cannot but deplore the fact that some of the believers are  reluctant to observe, as strictly as they should, the Feasts and  anniversaries prescribed by the Cause. This attitude, which may be  justified in certain exceptional circumstances, is fraught with  incalculable dangers and harm to the community, and will, if allowed to  persist, seriously endanger its influence and prestige in the public eye.  Unity of action, in matters of so vital an importance as the observance of  Baha'i holidays, is essential. It is the responsibility of the N.S.A. to  remind and urge the friends to faithfully carry out all such laws and  precepts of the Cause, the enforcement of which does not constitute an  open violation of the laws of their country.    [From the Guardian:]    The striking evidences of renewed Baha'i activity throughout India and  Burma, the recent manifestations of loyalty, solidarity and self-sacrifice  on the part of individuals, groups and Assemblies in both the teaching and  administrative spheres of Baha'i service, rejoice my heart and revive and  enliven my hopes for the future of that land. The friends in India and  Burma have made a splendid start. They have laid a firm foundation within  the framework of the administrative order of our Faith. They have  weathered manifold and distressing difficulties and successfully  surmounted formidable obstacles. A new era is opening before them. I have  no doubt that they will rise to the height of the occasion, and will prove  themselves worthy of their high destiny.    November 22, 1935          Effective Publicity Throughout India      He feels greatly rejoiced at the important steps you have taken for giving  the Cause a wide and effective publicity throughout India. He has read  with much interest the newspaper clipping which you had enclosed, and  sincerely hopes that your masterly sketch of the history and teachings of  the Cause will serve to attract leading personalities among the Indian  public to the Faith.    Regarding the publication of the Hindi, Sindhi and Bengali translations of  \"Baha'u'llah and the New Era,\" the Guardian very much appreciates your  N.S.A.'s response to his call for speeding up the printing of these works  which, he hopes, will, when widely circulated throughout the country open  a new era of unprecedented teaching activity not only in India and Burma,  but also in Ceylon and other neighbouring countries.    January 3, 1936    He feels really proud of you and of your distinguished and able co-workers  in the National "]]]
