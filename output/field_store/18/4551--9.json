Some folk  were lying supine on the ground, some were seated all crouched  up, and others were going about continually. Those who were going  around were far the more, and those the fewer who were lying down  under the torment, but they had their tongues more loose for  wailing.    Over all the sand, with a slow falling, were raining down dilated  flakes of fire, as of snow on alps without a wind. As the flames  which Alexander in those hot parts of India saw falling upon his  host, solid to the ground, wherefore he took care to trample the  soil by his troops, because the vapor was better extinguished  while it was single; so was descending the eternal glow whereby  the sand was kindled, like tinder beneath the steel, for doubling  of the dole. Without repose was ever the dance of the wretched  hands, now there, now here, brushing from them the fresh burning.    I began, \"Master, thou that overcomest everything, except the  obdurate demons, who at the entrance of the gate came out against  us, who is that great one that seemeth not to heed the fire, and  lies scornful and contorted, so that the rain seems not to ripen  him?\" And that same one who had perceived that I was asking my  Leader about him, cried out, \"Such as I was alive, such am I  dead. Though Jove weary his smith, from whom in wrath he took the  sharp thunderbolt wherewith on my last day I was smitten, or  though he weary the others, turn by turn, in Mongibello at the  black forge, crying, 'Good Vulcan, help, help!' even as he did at  the fight of Phlegra, and should hurl on me with all his might,  thereby he should not have glad vengeance.\"    Then my Leader spoke with force so great that I had not heard him  so loud, \"O Capaneus, in that thy pride is not quenched, art thou  the more punished; no torture save thine own rage would be a pain  adequate to thy fury.\"    Then he turned round to me with better look, saying, \"He was one  of the Seven Kings that besieged Thebes, and he held, and it  appears that he holds God in disdain, and little it appears that  he prizes Him; but as I said to him, his own despites are very  due adornments for his breast. Now come on behind me, and take  heed withal, not to set thy feet upon the burning sand, but keep  them always close unto the wood.\"    Silent we came to where spirts forth from the wood a little  streamlet, the redness of which still makes me shudder. As from  the Bulicame issues a brooklet, which then the sinful women share  among them, so this down across the sand went along.[1] Its bed  and both its sloping banks were made of stone, and the margins on  the side, whereby I perceived that the crossing[2] was there.    [1] The Bulicame, a hot spring near Viterbo, much frequented as a  bath, the use of a portion of which was assigned to \"sinful  women.\"    [2] The crossing of the breadth of the round of burning sand, on  the way inward toward the next circle.      \"Among all else that I have shown to thee, since we entered  through the gate whose threshold is barred to no one, nothing has  been discerned by thine eyes so notable as is the present stream  which deadens all the flamelets upon it.\" These words were of my  Leader, wherefore I prayed him, that he should give me largess of  the food for which he had given me largess of desire.    \"In mid sea sits a wasted land,\" said he then, \"which is named  Crete, under whose king the world of old was chaste. A mountain  is there that of old was glad with waters and with leaves, which  is called Ida; now it is desert, like a thing outworn. Rhea chose  it of old for the trusty cradle of her little son, and to conceal  him better when he cried had shoutings made there. Within the  mountain stands erect a great old man, who holds his shoulders  turned towards Damietta, and looks at Rome as if his mirror. His  head is formed of fine gold, and pure silver are his arms and  breast; then he is of brass far as to the fork. From there  downward he is all of chosen iron, save that his right foot is of  baked clay, and he stands erect on that more than on the  other.[1] Every part except the gold is cleft with a fissure that  trickles tears, which collected perforate that cavern. Their  course falls from rock to rock into this valley; they form  Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon; then it goes down through this  narrow channel far as where there is no more descending. They  form Cocytus, and what that pool is, thou shalt see; therefore  here is it not told.\"    [1] This image is taken directly from the dream of Nebuchadnezzar  (Daniel ii. 31-33). It is the type of the ages of tradition and  history, with its back to the past, its face toward Rome,--the  seat of the Empire and of the Church. The tears of the sin and  suffering of the generations of man form the rivers of Hell.      And I to him, \"If the present rill floweth down thus from our  world, why doth it appear to us only at this rim?\"    And he to me, \"Thou knowest that the place is round, and though  thou art come far, ever to the left descending toward the bottom,  not yet hast thou turned through the whole circle; wherefore if a  new thing appears to us, it ought not to bring wonder to thy  face.\"    And I again, \"Master, where are Phlegethon and Lethe found, for  of the one thou art silent, and of the other thou sayest that it  is formed by this rain?\"    \"In all thy questions surely thou pleasest me,\" he answered, \"but  the boiling of the red water ought truly to solve one that thou  askest. Lethe thou shalt see, but outside of this ditch, there  where souls go to lave themselves when sin repented of is taken  away.\" Then he said, \"Now it is time to depart from the wood;  take heed that thou come behind me; the margins afford way, for  they are not burning, and above them all the vapor is  extinguished.\"        CANTO XV. Third round of the Seventh Circle: of those who have  done violence to Nature.--Brunetto Latini.--Prophecies of  misfortune to Dante.    Now one of the hard margins bears us on, and the fume of the  brook overshadows so that it saves the water and the banks from  the fire. As the Flemings, between Wissant and Bruges, fearing  the flood that is blown in upon them, make the dyke whereby the  sea is routed; and as the Paduans along the Brenta, in order to  defend their towns and castles, ere Chiarentana[1] feel the  heat,--in such like were these made, though neither so high nor  so thick had the master, whoever he was, made them.    [1] The mountain range north of the Brenta, by the floods from  which the river is swollen in the spring.      We were now so remote from the wood that I could not have seen  where it was though I had turned me round to look, when we  encountered a troop of souls which was coming along by the bank,  and each of them was looking at us, as at eve one is wont to look  at another under the new moon, and they so sharpened their brows  toward us as the old tailor does on the needle's eye.    Thus gazed at by that company, I was recognized by one who took  me by the hem, and cried out, \"What a marvel!\" And when he  stretched out his arm to me, I fixed my eyes on his baked aspect  so that his scorched visage prevented not my mind from  recognizing him; and bending down my own to his face, I answered,  \"Are you here, Sir Brunetto?\"[1] And he, \"O my son, let it not  displease thee if Brunetto Latini turn a little back with thee,  and let the train go on.\" I said to him, \"With all my power I  pray this of you, and if you will that I seat myself with you I  will do so, if it pleaseth this one, for I go with him.\" \"O son,\"  said he, \"whoever of this herd stops for an instant lies then a  hundred years without fanning himself when the fire smites him;  therefore go onward, I will come at thy skirts, and then I will  rejoin my band which goeth weeping its eternal sufferings.\"    [1] Brunetto Latini, one of the most learned and able Florentines  of the thirteenth century. He was banished with the other chiefs  of the Guelph party, after the battle of Montaperti, in 1260, and  went to France, where he resided for many years. After his return  to Florence he became Secretary of the Commune, and he was the  master of Dante and Guido Cavalcanti. His principal literary work  was Li Livres dou Tresor, written in French, an interesting  compend of the omne scibile. He died in 1290. Dante uses the  plural \"you\" in addressing him, as a sign of respect.      I dared not descend from the road to go level with him, but I  held my head bowed like one who goes reverently. He began, \"What  fortune, or destiny, ere the last day, brings thee down here? and  who is this that shows the road?\"    \"There above, in the clear life,\" I answered him, \"I lost myself  in a valley, before my time was full. Only yester morn I turned  my back on it; this one[1] appeared to me as I was returning to  it, and he is leading me homeward along this path.\"    [1] Dante never speaks Virgil's name in Hell.      And he to me: \"If thou follow thy star, thou canst not miss the  glorious port, if, in the beautiful life, I discerned aright. And  if I had not so untimely died, seeing heaven so benignant unto  thee I would have given cheer unto thy work. But that ungrateful  populace malign which descended from Fiesole of old,[1] and  smacks yet of the mountain and the rock, will hate thee because  of thy good deeds; and this is right, for among the bitter sorb  trees it is not fitting the sweet fig should bear fruit. Old  report in the world calls them blind; it is a people avaricious,  envious, and proud; from their customs take heed that thou keep  thyself clean. Thy fortune reserves such honor for thee that one  party and the other shall hunger for thee; but far from the goat  shall be the grass. Let the Fiesolan beasts make litter of  themselves, and touch not the plant, if any spring still upon  their dungheap, in which may live again the holy seed of those  Romans who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#12)"],[1,"is assumed is communicated in  some degree to what is assumed to it, just as dignity is communicated  to whosoever is assumed to a dignity. But it is of the nature of a  person to be incommunicable, as was said above (I, Q. 29, A. 1).  Therefore it is not befitting to a Divine Person to assume, i.e. to  take to Himself.    Obj. 3: Further, person is constituted by nature. But it is repugnant  that the thing constituted should assume the constituent, since the  effect does not act on its cause. Hence it is not befitting to a  Person to assume a nature.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine [*Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Petrum  ii): \"This God, i.e. the only-Begotten one, took the form,\" i.e. the  nature, \"of a servant to His own Person.\" But the only-Begotten God  is a Person. Therefore it is befitting to a Person to take, i.e. to  assume a nature.    _I answer that,_ In the word \"assumption\" are implied two things,  viz. the principle and the term of the act, for to assume is to take  something to oneself. Now of this assumption a Person is both the  principle and the term. The principle--because it properly belongs to  a person to act, and this assuming of flesh took place by the Divine  action. Likewise a Person is the term of this assumption, because, as  was said above (Q. 2, AA. 1, 2), the union took place in the Person,  and not in the nature. Hence it is plain that to assume a nature is  most properly befitting to a Person.    Reply Obj. 1: Since the Divine Person is infinite, no addition can be  made to it: Hence Cyril says [*Council of Ephesus, Part I, ch. 26]:  \"We do not conceive the mode of conjunction to be according to  addition\"; just as in the union of man with God, nothing is added to  God by the grace of adoption, but what is Divine is united to man;  hence, not God but man is perfected.    Reply Obj. 2: A Divine Person is said to be incommunicable inasmuch  as It cannot be predicated of several supposita, but nothing prevents  several things being predicated of the Person. Hence it is not  contrary to the nature of person to be communicated so as to subsist  in several natures, for even in a created person several natures may  concur accidentally, as in the person of one man we find quantity and  quality. But this is proper to a Divine Person, on account of its  infinity, that there should be a concourse of natures in it, not  accidentally, but in subsistence.    Reply Obj. 3: As was said above (Q. 2, A. 1), the human nature  constitutes a Divine Person, not simply, but forasmuch as the Person  is denominated from such a nature. For human nature does not make the  Son of Man to be simply, since He was from eternity, but only to be  man. It is by the Divine Nature that a Divine Person is constituted  simply. Hence the Divine Person is not said to assume the Divine  Nature, but to assume the human nature.  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [III, Q. 3, Art. 2]    Whether It Is Befitting to the Divine Nature to Assume?    Objection 1: It would seem that it is not befitting to the Divine  Nature to assume. Because, as was said above (A. 1), to assume is to  take to oneself. But the Divine Nature did not take to Itself human  nature, for the union did not take place in the nature, as was said  above (Q. 2, AA. 1, 3). Hence it is not befitting to the Divine  Nature to assume human nature.    Obj. 2: Further, the Divine Nature is common to the three Persons.  If, therefore, it is befitting to the Divine Nature to assume, it  consequently is befitting to the three Persons; and thus the Father  assumed human nature even as the Son, which is erroneous.    Obj. 3: Further, to assume is to act. But to act befits a person, not  a nature, which is rather taken to be the principle by which the  agent acts. Therefore to assume is not befitting to the nature.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine (Fulgentius) says (De Fide ad Petrum  ii): \"That nature which remains eternally begotten of the Father\"  (i.e. which is received from the Father by eternal generation) \"took  our nature free of sin from His Mother.\"    _I answer that,_ As was said above (A. 1), in the word assumption two  things are signified--to wit, the principle and the term of the  action. Now to be the principle of the assumption belongs to the  Divine Nature in itself, because the assumption took place by Its  power; but to be the term of the assumption does not belong to the  Divine Nature in itself, but by reason of the Person in Whom It is  considered to be. Hence a Person is primarily and more properly said  to assume, but it may be said secondarily that the Nature assumed a  nature to Its Person. And after the same manner the Nature is also  said to be incarnate, not that it is changed to flesh, but that it  assumed the nature of flesh. Hence Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii,  6): \"Following the blessed Athanasius and Cyril we say that the  Nature of God is incarnate.\"    Reply Obj. 1: \"Oneself\" is reciprocal, and points to the same  suppositum. But the Divine Nature is not a distinct suppositum from  the Person of the Word. Hence, inasmuch as the Divine Nature took  human nature to the Person of the Word, It is said to take it to  Itself. But although the Father takes human nature to the Person of  the Word, He did not thereby take it to Himself, for the suppositum  of the Father and the Son is not one, and hence it cannot properly be  said that the Father assumes human nature.    Reply Obj. 2: What is befitting to the Divine Nature in Itself is  befitting to the three Persons, as goodness, wisdom, and the like.  But to assume belongs to It by reason of the Person of the Word, as  was said above, and hence it is befitting to that Person alone.    Reply Obj. 3: As in God _what is_ and _whereby it is_ are the same,  so likewise in Him _what acts_ and _whereby it acts_ are the same,  since everything acts, inasmuch as it is a being. Hence the Divine  Nature is both that whereby God acts, and the very God Who acts.  _______________________    THIRD ARTICLE [III, Q. 3, Art. 3]    Whether the Nature Abstracted from the Personality Can Assume?    Objection 1: It would seem that if we abstract the Personality by our  mind, the Nature cannot assume. For it was said above (A. 1) that it  belongs to the Nature to assume by reason of the Person. But what  belongs to one by reason of another cannot belong to it if the other  is removed; as a body, which is visible by reason of color, without  color cannot be seen. Hence if the Personality be mentally  abstracted, the Nature cannot assume.    Obj. 2: Further, assumption implies the term of union, as was said  above (A. 1). But the union cannot take place in the nature, but only  in the Person. Therefore, if the Personality be abstracted, the  Divine Nature cannot assume.    Obj. 3: Further, it has been said above (I, Q. 40, A. 3) that in the  Godhead if the Personality is abstracted, nothing remains. But the  one who assumes is something. Therefore, if the Personality is  abstracted, the Divine Nature cannot assume.    _On the contrary,_ In the Godhead Personality signifies a personal  property; and this is threefold, viz. Paternity, Filiation and  Procession, as was said above (I, Q. 30, A. 2). Now if we mentally  abstract these, there still remains the omnipotence of God, by which  the Incarnation was wrought, as the angel says (Luke 1:37): \"No word  shall be impossible with God.\" Therefore it seems that if the  Personality be removed, the Divine Nature can still assume.    _I answer that,_ The intellect stands in two ways towards God. First,  to know God as He is, and in this manner it is impossible for the  intellect to circumscribe something in God and leave the rest, for  all that is in God is one, except the distinction of Persons; and as  regards these, if one is removed the other is taken away, since they  are distinguished by relations only which must be together at the  same time. Secondly, the intellect stands towards God, not indeed as  knowing God as He is, but in its own way, i.e. understanding  manifoldly and separately what in God is one: and in this way our  intellect can understand the Divine goodness and wisdom, and the  like, which are called essential attributes, without understanding  Paternity or Filiation, which are called Personalities. And hence if  we abstract Personality by our intellect, we may still understand the  Nature assuming.    Reply Obj. 1: Because in God _what is,_ and _whereby it is,_ are one,  if any one of the things which are attributed to God in the abstract  is considered in itself, abstracted from all else, it will still be  something subsisting, and consequently a Person, since it is an  intellectual nature. Hence just as we now say three Persons, on  account of holding three personal properties, so likewise if we  mentally exclude the personal properties there will still remain in  our thought the Divine Nature as subsisting and as a Person. And in  this way It may be understood to assume human nature by reason of Its  subsistence or Personality.    Reply Obj. 2: Even if the personal properties of the three Persons  are abstracted by our mind, nevertheless there will remain in our  thoughts the one Personality of God, as the Jews consider. And the  assumption can be terminated in It, as we now say it is terminated in  the Person of the Word.    Reply Obj. 3: If we mentally abstract the Personality, it is said  that nothing remains by way of resolution, i.e. as if the subject of  the relation and the relation itself were distinct because all we can  think of in God is considered as a subsisting suppositum. However,  some of the things predicated of God can be understood without  others, not by way of resolution, but by the way mentioned above.  _______________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 3, Art. 4]    Whether One Person Without Another Can Assume a Created Nature?
