At the burial of one that was  slain in battle, his comrades marched three times round the burning  pile or grave, shaking their arms, and throwing swords, bridles,  belts, and other articles into the fire or grave after the body. When  a soldier fell fighting in the field, and his body could not be found,  he was honoured with the carriage of an empty bier, and funeral  ceremonies as if his remains were present.    If a man killed himself, the hand with which the deed was committed  was cut off, and buried in another place to that in which the other  part of the body was interred. If one man killed another in a  righteous cause, the slayer washed his hands and held up the weapon  that had been used towards the sun, with the blood on it, to show that  he feared not though the heavens as well as the earth knew what he had  done. The ancients were of opinion that if one were slain by a  relative, the blood could never be thoroughly wiped off the blade that  had cut down the individual. And for fear the Furies would avenge the  death of one killed by a relation, amulets and spells were provided to  prevent untoward events. The most powerful charms were supposed to be  parts of the slain individual. Therefore the fingers, toes, and other  extreme parts of the body were cut off and worn under the arm-pits, to  prevent the murdered person's ghost taking revenge for the unlawful  deed. In preparing a body for burial, the Greeks took a piece of money  and put it into the mouth, to give to the ferryman Charon. With the  money a small quantity of pudding or cheese was put in for Cerberus,  to propitiate him. As a corpse was being carried out to be interred,  the deceased was commended to the protection of the infernal gods. To  burn a body was considered more honourable than to lay it in the cold  grave, for the Greeks thought that the divine and purer part of man  was carried by fire to the abode of the gods above. This belief  induced fanatical persons, when tired of life below, to burn  themselves, that they might all the sooner take their flight to the  regions of bliss. If a high wind sprang up when a body was being  consumed by flames, it was regarded as a favourable omen. On the body  being consumed, the fire was extinguished with red wine.    After a funeral, the people fumigated the house with brimstone, and  cleansed themselves by passing over a fire. They then kept a feast, or  rather feasts, at which they sacrificed to Mercury, that he might  carry the soul of the deceased to the realms of happiness. At the same  time the ghosts of relations were sacrificed to. Those who petitioned  the gods had garlands about their necks, or green boughs in their  hands. The branches were either laurel or olive, because the former  signified triumph, and the latter peace and goodwill.    Swine and swine's flesh were held in high esteem by the Greeks and  Romans, for various reasons--one of which was that Jupiter was nursed  by a sow. It was the custom to drink healths or toasts, and the last  one before going to bed was to Mercury, that he might give sound sleep  and pleasant dreams. Great men would, on a high occasion, drink to a  favourite, and hand him the cup to keep. When a person drank to the  health of one he loved, he partook of part of the liquor, and poured  the remainder of the wine on the ground. Drinking cups in remote times  were made from bulls' horns. The Greeks consecrated their horses to  the sun, and before engaging in war they consulted their prophets and  diviners. In particular, they paid great attention to the utterances  of Egyptian priestesses kept by them. Then, similar to the manner of  the Jews, Persians, and others, the Greeks consecrated to the gods, in  the event of obtaining victory, portions of goods secured from the  vanquished; and even relations were offered in sacrifice to the gods  supposed to have given triumph to the victorious armies. A Greek  general did not think it lucky to march his forces before full moon,  or until the seventh day of the month. Sacrifices were offered to the  water when an army came to a river,--a custom observed by other  nations.    Certain words were never pronounced by the Greeks. For instance, they  carefully withheld their lips from uttering \"prison;\" and if they  happened to hear what they thought an unlucky speech, they replied,  \"Let it return to thine own head.\" So far did they carry their  superstition, that if one heard an unfavourable expression when he was  about to drink, he would throw the liquor on the floor and call for  another cup. Sneezing was so superstitiously regarded, that it came to  be counted among the number of gods. It was deemed inauspicious if a  host sent his guests away from a feast without giving each of them a  piece of cake, or such like, to take home. The cracking of a table and  the spilling of wine or salt were regarded as evil omens. When a Greek  ship was in danger in a storm, one of the crew or a passenger was  chosen by lot, and thrown overboard, like Jonah, to appease the spirit  that ruled the winds and the waves.

The old Roman delusions and customs were as extraordinary as those of  any nation with which history has made us acquainted. The augurs  pretended to foretell future events from the flight of birds and the  chirping and feeding of fowls, and also from other appearances.  \"Augurium\" and \"auspicium\" were generally used promiscuously.  Auspicium was properly the foretelling of future events from the  inspection of birds; augurium from any omen or prodigy whatever. The  augurs are supposed to have derived tokens of futurity chiefly from  five sources--appearances in the heavens (such as thunder or  lightning), from the singing or flight of birds, from the feeding of  fowls, from the movements of quadrupeds, and from uncommon accidents.  The birds which chiefly gave omens by sound were ravens, crows, owls,  and cocks,--and those by flight, eagles and vultures. Contempt of the  augurs, and neglect of their intimations, were said to be followed by  dire misfortunes. Omens coming from the left were generally supposed  by the Romans to be lucky. Thunder on the left was regarded as a good  sign, and so was the cawing of a crow on the same side; but it was  considered more fortunate to hear the croaking of a raven on the right  than on the left. The Romans, as the Greeks had done before them, took  omens from quadrupeds crossing their path or appearing in unaccustomed  places. The augurs taught the people how to draw conclusions from  sneezing, spilling salt, and other accidents, called dira.    Drawing of lots was frequently resorted to by the Romans wishing to  pry into futurity. The lots were dice, or articles resembling those  instruments of chance. They were thrown into an urn filled with water,  or cast as dice in the ordinary way. If there was any difficulty in  ascertaining the import of the dice throwing, the priests were  employed to interpret. Future events were frequently inquired into by  an inquisitive person cutting the branch of a tree into small pieces,  and distinguishing them by certain marks, and then scattering them at  random on a white cloth. The searcher after knowledge having prayed to  the gods, took up the slips three times, and interpreted according to  the marks. Future events were often inquired into by reading the first  line or passage which happened to turn up on opening a book, or by  observing the stars. It was supposed to be lucky to be born under a  certain star, and unlucky to come into the world under another.  Astrologers were consulted regarding one's natal hour. Fortune-tellers  and books of fate were consulted on the most trivial occasions; and  persons aspiring to the magistracy, after saying their prayers in the  open air, had recourse to augury with the view of ascertaining whether  the gods favoured their cause.    Great attention was paid by the Romans to dreams, and persons of  disordered minds were supposed to possess the faculty of presaging  future events. Omens of futurity were also drawn from the appearance  of the entrails of animals offered in sacrifice to the gods. The flame  and smoke from the altar were noticed, and so were the circumstances  attending the driving, felling, and bleeding of the victim. Sibylline  books were inspected by appointment of the senate at perilous times,  as they were supposed to contain the fate of the Roman Empire. There  was something mysterious about the origin of the sibylline books. It  is reported that a woman called Amalthaea, from a foreign country, came  to Tarquin the Proud to sell nine sibylline books."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],[0,"Villa Elsa (#12)"],[1," he is dropped and we must read about  another in control. How does that make for any well-considered and  thoroughly demonstrated plans? Would it not be the natural result  that the German people are completely contented and the American  people are always discontented?\"    Rudolph's excited pronouncements ran along a different line,  interchanged with voluminous whiffs of tobacco.    \"Under our Government, Herr Kirtley, the German flag is seen in all  parts of the globe. And wherever it is seen, it is respected,  feared. Who ever sees the American flag? Even _I_ don't know what it  looks like. It is not feared. It is only noticed out of voluntary  courtesy. And a nation can't be really great without an army like  ours. The army is the spine of the country. It makes a country a  vertebrate. What would even Germany be without its army? Almost  nothing. The army consolidates, trains, disciplines. It gives us  health, good constitutions, industrious habits, exactness. It makes  a nation superior because it fortifies human effort. In the constant  changing of our regiments about to different sections of the Empire,  our soldiers come to be well acquainted everywhere. They make  friends and are at home in every direction. They learn to realize  how great we are and this strengthens the German feeling and makes  all parts of the nation one.    \"Of course we have the only first-class army. All our General Staff  has to do any day is to say the word and, as I have so often said,  our army can go out and defeat the world. Our navy will soon be in a  position to destroy England's. We are getting her trade routes, her  mail routes. Our goods are now selling everywhere. It is not only  because they are the best and the cheapest, but because our army and  our navy stand behind them to _make_ people know what is best for  them. Every little German box of goods has a big gun behind it. Of  course we don't need to use the gun--_yet_--because people are  crying for our manufactures all over the world. If we had occupied  your big and half-developed country in your place, we would have  long ago been the only great State. There would have been no others.  We would have annihilated them if they were not willing to become  German provinces.\"    Rudi took a long pull at his cigarette, with his elbows outspread  like the haughty wings of the Prussian eagles of war. Emitting a  long streamer of smoke, he summed up the whole thing in a nutshell  with a derisory--Pouf!    Kirtley was inwardly fired up with resentment. Then he had to  smother a laugh. This exhibition of the family taken off its guard  was more instructive than volumes of discussion he might read about  the true German attitude toward America--toward everyone. Were these  but Goths with the German skins scratched off a little? He kept  thinking of Anderson--how it furnished the pure evidence of what the  latter was despairing of before deaf ears! Gard's respect, his  sympathy, for the old man, jumped up with patriotic fervor.    He marveled at first how the good Buchers had been primed with this  knowledge, these comparisons. Then he realized that the editorials  and other articles in the Dresden journals, whose lengthy, heavy,  pounding sentences confused with an obtuse, inverted syntax he was  reading at Anderson's suggestion, accounted for these venomous  conceptions and prejudices.    \"So it is our duty to hate,\" broke in the Herr once more, with  croaks and grunts now behind his long porcelain pipe which roved  down over his stomach, a green tassel dangling at the end. \"We give  our children beatings to educate them, don't we? So we have the best  education. We must give the world a beating to improve it.\"    The Frau all the while could hardly restrain herself.    \"You know what we in Germany call Americans? We call them  pigs--yes, _pigs_. America is like a big pig pen where everybody is  wallowing over everybody for money--just for money.\"    \"And Germany,\" added her elder son, \"is just waiting till the United  States gets money enough, then we go in with our _navy_ and our  _army_ and take it all.\"    Gard wanted to see how far they _would_ go, and he had seen. Was  this the old barbarian of the north risen to earth again, his rude  garments of hide torn off, exposing him in his pristine, fighting  nakedness? Where was the German under it all--the German who was  taken to be civilized in heart and spirit as other men are? These  law-abiding, stay-at-home people had deliberately grown in Villa  Elsa this robust plant of contempt, so full-blossomed now and ready  to exhale its noisome fumes which at moments almost stifled Kirtley  with their poison. What would Rebner say to this with his golden,  soul-felt opinions of the excelling race!    This hospitable and apparently harmless domicile was, in reality,  like a martial encampment. Gard could not but conclude that he would  have to leave Loschwitz. How could he for a moment stay in face of  these direct and hard-fisted attacks? And certainly Villa Elsa would  not want to harbor a hog any longer. The similar households he had  come to know, all such households, unquestionably bore the same  furious grudges against the western hemisphere.    But Elsa? How could he leave her--like this? She was the first girl  to excite seriously his affections. She seemed to strike the note of  whatever was truly earnest in him. Yet did she, too, think Americans  were pigs? Did she consider him of such an inferior breed? Perhaps,  in her misled innocence, she did. Perhaps that was the reason why  she acted toward him in an upsetting fashion which only the more  tempted a certain tenacious element in his make-up.          CHAPTER XIV    AFTERMATH      This astonishing outbreak in Villa Elsa was followed by something  still more singular to Kirtley, or at least out of his reckoning. It  was to stir the depths of his contemplations and comparisons and  give him the sharpest look into German character he had yet  received. It was to show him that a gaping abyss might be separating  the Teuton from other western humanity. Having latterly doubted that  the race was easy of sympathetic grasp, any true kinship, he now  profoundly realized that instead of being able to approach it nearer  in feeling the more he knew it, he was encountering very high cliffs  that threatened forever to mark an inaccessible boundary line.    He had taken it for granted that the anti-American outburst would  end the Buchers' relations with him. He must have turned out to be  very unwelcome. The very sight of him as one of the American pigs  about the house must have been most unsatisfactory, distasteful.  They could not from now on visibly wish him or any Yankee in their  home. Their personal dignity could not permit their assault to be  backed up afterward by any equivocal conduct toward him.    Then, too, they would expect that he would not want to remain. Had  they not voluntarily, deliberately, hurled at him their defiant  scorn of his people? Self-respect would demand his immediate  departure.    As for himself, Gard passed a sleepless night thinking hotly about  the episode. Toward morning he cooled off. These were boors. Why  should he take to heart their boorishness? Richness was here indeed.  Just the place to keep finding out the real German. Having let the  bars down with such a bang and hullabaloo, the family would from now  on readily and fully reveal themselves. It is a poor investigator  and observer who is easily shied away from his purpose by taunts and  ill-breeding.    But the miracle was that the Buchers went on exactly as before. They  obviously saw no reasons for altering their friendly daily  intercourse, nor did they have any idea that he should harbor a  grievance. Beginning with the next morning, their usual amicable  bearing and attentions continued uninterrupted. The family was not  conscious of having tried to give mortal offense or to cause  resentment from him.    For, to a German, blows in all senses are a normal part of living.  His social habits indulge themselves in knocks, coarse attacks,  unseemly abuse, as rather matters of course. He wields a bludgeon  where more refined men would cut down with sarcasm or wither one  with disdain. Blows are his natural method of instructing others and  of getting himself instructed. \"Good German blows\" are what the  Kaiser talked of loudly. To strike as well as to kick is a  wholesome, healthful, righteous procedure, not to be grieved over,  not to be kept rankling in the bosom. It is truth and fact in  action, and action should always be forceful and decisive to be  effective. The whipping of a school boy for any just cause should  not be remembered by him throughout life as something to be allowed  to fester or as calling for angry vengeance.    So Gard's hosts pursued the tenor of their ways as if that  detonating night had witnessed nothing. Their insensitiveness about  it included insensitiveness about him. In other words, he discovered  that as you cannot insult a German, therefore he cannot insult you.  He does not know about such things in the Anglo-Saxon meaning. His  conception of social and moral values is so obtusely or radically  different from those of the truly occidental civilizations that  there is little common ground here. Consequently, in such relations,  the Teuton does not feel anything to be sorry for. There is nothing  for him to worry about in any shame the next day.    Kirtley learned gradually, through his dealings with tradesmen and  in hearing business men talk in the cafes, that this underbred  attitude extended into the German secular world. A German may cheat  you, lie to you, take a grossly unfair advantage of your good faith,  but he will not expect that this is going to interfere with a  continuance of your business relations. It is only a part of the  hard game of gain. If you indignantly enumerate to him the facts of  your unpleasant discovery, he"]]]
