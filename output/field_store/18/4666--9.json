Not  merely the tablelands of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, but  also by far the larger part of Cape Colony and nearly the whole of Natal  (excluding a small strip along the coast), attain this elevation. Thus  even in summer, when the heat is great during the day, the coolness of  the night refreshes the system. The practical test of night temperature  is whether one wishes for a blanket to sleep under. In Madras and Bombay  all the year round, in New York through several months of summer, in  Paris or sometimes even in London for a few days in July or August, a  light blanket is oppressive, and the continuance of the high day  temperature through the hours of darkness exhausts and enfeebles all but  vigorous constitutions. But in South Africa it is only along the coast,  in places like Durban, Delagoa Bay, or Beira, that one feels inclined to  dispense with a woollen covering at night, while in Johannesburg or  Bloemfontein a good thick blanket is none too much even in November,  before the cooling rains begin, or in December, when the days are  longest. In fact, the fall of temperature at sunset is often a source of  risk to those who, coming straight from Europe, have not yet learned to  guard against sudden changes, for it causes chills which, if they find a  weak organ to pounce upon, may produce serious illness. These rapid  variations of temperature are not confined to the passage from day to  night. Sometimes in the midst of a run of the usual warm, brilliant  weather of the dry season there will come a cold, bitter south east  wind, covering the sky with gray clouds and driving the traveller to put  on every wrap he possesses. I remember, toward the end of October, such  a sudden \"cold snap\" in Matabililand, only twenty degrees from the  equator. One shivered all day long under a thick greatcoat, and the  natives lit fires in front of their huts and huddled round them for  warmth. Chills dangerous to delicate people are apt to be produced by  these changes, and they often turn into feverish attacks, not malarial,  though liable to be confounded with malarial fevers. This risk of  encountering cold weather is a concomitant of that power of the  south-east wind to keep down the great heats, which, on the whole, makes  greatly for the salubrity of the country; so the gain exceeds the loss.  But new comers have to be on their guard, and travellers will do well,  even between the tropic and the equator, to provide themselves with warm  clothing.    Strong as the sun is, its direct rays seem to be much less dangerous  than in India or the eastern United States. Sunstroke is unusual, and  one sees few people wearing, even in the tropical north, those hats of  thick double felt or those sun-helmets which are deemed indispensable in  India. In fact, Europeans go about with the same head-gear which they  use in an English summer. But the relation of sun-stroke to climate is  obscure. Why should it be extremely rare in California, when it is very  common in New York in the same latitude? Why should it be almost unknown  in the Hawaiian Islands, within seventeen degrees of the equator? Its  rarity in South Africa is a great point in favour of the healthfulness  of the country, and also of the ease and pleasantness of life. In India  one has to be always mounting guard against the sun. He is a formidable  and ever-present enemy, and he is the more dangerous the longer you live  in the country. In South Africa it is only because he dries up the soil  so terribly that the traveller wishes to have less of him. The born  Africander seems to love him.    The dryness of the climate makes very strongly for its salubrity. It is  the absence of moisture no less than the elevation above sea-level that  gives to the air its fresh, keen, bracing quality, the quality which  enables one to support the sun-heat, which keeps the physical frame in  vigour, which helps children to grow up active and healthy, which  confines to comparatively few districts that deadliest foe of Europeans,  swamp-fever. Malarial fever in one of its many forms, some of them  intermittent, others remittent, is the scourge of the east coast as well  as of the west coast. To find some means of avoiding it would be to  double the value of Africa to the European powers which have been  establishing themselves on the coasts. No one who lives within thirty  miles of the sea nearly all the way south from Cape Guardafui to  Zululand can hope to escape it. It is frequent all round the great  Nyanza lakes, and particularly severe in the valley of the Nile from the  lakes downward to Khartoum. It prevails through the comparatively low  country which lies along the Congo and the chief tributaries of that  great stream. It hangs like a death-cloud over the valley of the  Zambesi, and is found up to a height of 3000 or 4000 feet, sometimes  even higher, in Nyassaland and the lower parts of the British  territories that stretch to Lake Tanganyika. The Administrator of German  East Africa has lately declared that there is not a square mile of that  vast region that can be deemed free from it. Even along the generally  arid shores of Damaraland there are spots where it is to be feared. But  Cape Colony and Natal and the Orange Free State are almost exempt from  it. So, too, are all the higher parts of the Transvaal, of Bechuanaland,  of Matabililand, and of Mashonaland. Roughly speaking, one may say that  the upper boundary line of malarial fevers in these countries is about  4500 feet above the sea, and where fevers occur at a height above 3000  feet they are seldom of a virulent type. Thus, while the lower parts of  the Transvaal between the Quathlamba Mountains and the sea are terribly  unhealthy, while the Portuguese country behind Delagoa Bay and Beira as  far as the foot of the hills is equally dangerous,--Beira itself has the  benefit of a strong sea-breeze,--by far the larger part of the recently  occupied British territories north and west of the Transvaal is  practically safe. It is, of course, proper to take certain precautions,  to avoid chills and the copious use of alcohol and it is specially  important to observe such precautions during and immediately after the  wet season, when the sun is raising vapours from the moist soil, when  new vegetation has sprung up, and when the long grass which has grown  during the first rains is rotting under the later rains. Places which  are quite healthful in the dry weather, such as Gaberones and the rest  of the upper valley of the rivers Notwani and Limpopo in eastern  Bechuanaland, then become dangerous, because they lie on the banks of  streams which inundate the lower grounds. Much depends on the local  circumstances of each spot. To illustrate the differences between one  place and another, I may take the case of the three chief posts in the  territories of the British South Africa Company. Buluwayo, nearly 4000  feet above the sea, is always practically free from malaria, for it  stands in a dry, breezy upland with few trees and short grass. Fort  Victoria, 3670 feet above the sea, is salubrious enough during the dry  season, but often feverish after the rains, because there is some wet  ground near it. Fort Salisbury, 4900 feet above the sea, is now  healthful at all times, but parts of it used to be feverish at the end  of the rainy season, until they were drained in the beginning of 1895.  So Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal Republic, is apt to be  malarious during the months of rain, because (although 4470 feet above  the sea) it lies in a well-watered hollow; while at Johannesburg, thirty  miles off, on the top of a high, bare, stony ridge, one has no occasion  to fear fever, though the want of water and proper drainage, as well as  the quantity of fine dust from the highly comminuted ore and \"tailings\"  with which the air is filled, had until 1896 given rise to other  maladies, and especially to septic pneumonia. These will diminish with a  better municipal administration, and similarly malaria will doubtless  vanish from the many spots where it is now rife when the swampy grounds  have been drained and the long grass eaten down by larger herds of  cattle.    It is apparently the dryness and the purity of the air which have given  South Africa its comparative immunity from most forms of chest disease.  Many sufferers from consumption, for whom a speedy death, if they  remained in Europe, had been predicted, recover health, and retain it  till old age. The spots chiefly recommended are on the high grounds of  the interior plateau, where the atmosphere is least humid. Ceres,  ninety-four miles by rail from Cape Town, and Beaufort West, in the  Karroo, have been resorted to as sanatoria; and Kimberley, the city of  diamonds, has an equally high reputation for the quality of its air.  However, some of the coast districts are scarcely less eligible, though  Cape Town has too many rapid changes of weather, and Durban too sultry a  summer, to make either of them a desirable place of residence for  invalids.    Apart from all questions of specific complaints, there can be no doubt  as to the general effect of the climate upon health. The aspect of the  people soon convinces a visitor that, in spite of its heat, the country  is well fitted to maintain in vigour a race drawn from the cooler parts  of Europe. Comparatively few adult Englishmen sprung from fathers  themselves born in Africa are as yet to be found. But the descendants of  the Dutch and Huguenot settlers are Africanders up to the sixth or  seventh generation, and the stock shows no sign of losing either its  stature or its physical strength. Athletic sports are pursued as eagerly  as in England.          CHAPTER III    WILD ANIMALS AND THEIR FATE      When first explored, South Africa was unusually rich in the kinds both  of plants and of animals which it contained; and until forty or fifty  years ago the number, size, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2233"],[0,"A Damsel in Distress (#12)"],[1,"says that policemen dive down manholes when they see  you coming.\"    The chill in the air would have daunted a less courageous girl.  Lady Caroline had risen, and was staring sternly. Percy was puffing  the puffs of an overwrought soul. Lord Marshmoreton, whose thoughts  had wandered off to the rose garden, pulled himself together and  tried to look menacing. Maud went on without waiting for a reply.  She was all bubbling gaiety and insouciance, a charming picture of  young English girlhood that nearly made her brother foam at the  mouth.    \"Father dear,\" she said, attaching herself affectionately to his  buttonhole, \"I went round the links in eighty-three this morning.  I did the long hole in four. One under par, a thing I've never done  before in my life.\" (\"Bless my soul,\" said Lord Marshmoreton  weakly, as, with an apprehensive eye on his sister, he patted his  daughter's shoulder.) \"First, I sent a screecher of a drive right  down the middle of the fairway. Then I took my brassey and put the  ball just on the edge of the green. A hundred and eighty yards if  it was an inch. My approach putt--\"    Lady Caroline, who was no devotee of the royal and ancient game,  interrupted the recital.    \"Never mind what you did this morning. What did you do yesterday  afternoon?\"    \"Yes,\" said Lord Belpher. \"Where were you yesterday afternoon?\"    Maud's gaze was the gaze of a young child who has never even  attempted to put anything over in all its little life.    \"Whatever do you mean?\"    \"What were you doing in Piccadilly yesterday afternoon?\" said Lady  Caroline.    \"Piccadilly? The place where Percy fights policemen? I don't  understand.\"    Lady Caroline was no sportsman. She put one of those direct  questions, capable of being answered only by \"Yes\" or \"No\", which  ought not to be allowed in controversy. They are the verbal  equivalent of shooting a sitting bird.    \"Did you or did you not go to London yesterday, Maud?\"    The monstrous unfairness of this method of attack pained Maud. From  childhood up she had held the customary feminine views upon the Lie  Direct. As long as it was a question of suppression of the true or  suggestion of the false she had no scruples. But she had a  distaste for deliberate falsehood. Faced now with a choice between  two evils, she chose the one which would at least leave her  self-respect.    \"Yes, I did.\"    Lady Caroline looked at Lord Belpher. Lord Belpher looked at  Lady Caroline.    \"You went to meet that American of yours?\"    Reggie Byng slid softly from the room. He felt that he would be  happier elsewhere. He had been an acutely embarrassed spectator of  this distressing scene, and had been passing the time by shuffling  his feet, playing with his coat buttons and perspiring.    \"Don't go, Reggie,\" said Lord Belpher.    \"Well, what I mean to say is--family row and what not--if you see  what I mean--I've one or two things I ought to do--\"    He vanished. Lord Belpher frowned a sombre frown. \"Then it was  that man who knocked my hat off?\"    \"What do you mean?\" said Lady Caroline. \"Knocked your hat off? You  never told me he knocked your hat off.\"    \"It was when I was asking him to let me look inside the cab. I had  grasped the handle of the door, when he suddenly struck my hat,  causing it to fly off. And, while I was picking it up, he drove  away.\"    \"C'k,\" exploded Lord Marshmoreton. \"C'k, c'k, c'k.\" He twisted his  face by a supreme exertion of will power into a mask of  indignation. \"You ought to have had the scoundrel arrested,\" he  said vehemently. \"It was a technical assault.\"    \"The man who knocked your hat off, Percy,\" said Maud, \"was  not . . . He was a different man altogether. A stranger.\"    \"As if you would be in a cab with a stranger,\" said Lady Caroline  caustically. \"There are limits, I hope, to even your indiscretions.\"    Lord Marshmoreton cleared his throat. He was sorry for Maud, whom  he loved.    \"Now, looking at the matter broadly--\"    \"Be quiet,\" said Lady Caroline.    Lord Marshmoreton subsided.    \"I wanted to avoid you,\" said Maud, \"so I jumped into the first cab  I saw.\"    \"I don't believe it,\" said Percy.    \"It's the truth.\"    \"You are simply trying to put us off the scent.\"    Lady Caroline turned to Maud. Her manner was plaintive. She looked  like a martyr at the stake who deprecatingly lodges a timid  complaint, fearful the while lest she may be hurting the feelings  of her persecutors by appearing even for a moment out of sympathy  with their activities.    \"My dear child, why will you not be reasonable in this matter? Why  will you not let yourself be guided by those who are older and  wiser than you?\"    \"Exactly,\" said Lord Belpher.    \"The whole thing is too absurd.\"    \"Precisely,\" said Lord Belpher.    Lady Caroline turned on him irritably.    \"Please do not interrupt, Percy. Now, you've made me forget what I  was going to say.\"    \"To my mind,\" said Lord Marshmoreton, coming to the surface once  more, \"the proper attitude to adopt on occasions like the present--\"    \"Please,\" said Lady Caroline.    Lord Marshmoreton stopped, and resumed his silent communion with the  stuffed bird.    \"You can't stop yourself being in love, Aunt Caroline,\" said Maud.    \"You can be stopped if you've somebody with a level head looking  after you.\"    Lord Marshmoreton tore himself away from the bird.    \"Why, when I was at Oxford in the year '87,\" he said chattily, \"I  fancied myself in love with the female assistant at a tobacconist  shop. Desperately in love, dammit. Wanted to marry her. I recollect  my poor father took me away from Oxford and kept me here at Belpher  under lock and key. Lock and key, dammit. I was deucedly upset at  the time, I remember.\" His mind wandered off into the glorious  past. \"I wonder what that girl's name was. Odd one can't remember  names. She had chestnut hair and a mole on the side of her chin. I  used to kiss it, I recollect--\"    Lady Caroline, usually such an advocate of her brother's researches  into the family history, cut the reminiscences short.    \"Never mind that now.\"    \"I don't. I got over it. That's the moral.\"    \"Well,\" said Lady Caroline, \"at any rate poor father acted with  great good sense on that occasion. There seems nothing to do but to  treat Maud in just the same way. You shall not stir a step from the  castle till you have got over this dreadful infatuation. You will  be watched.\"    \"I shall watch you,\" said Lord Belpher solemnly, \"I shall watch  your every movement.\"    A dreamy look came into Maud's brown eyes.    \"Stone walls do not a prison make nor iron bars a cage,\" she said  softly.    \"That wasn't your experience, Percy, my boy,\" said Lord  Marshmoreton.    \"They make a very good imitation,\" said Lady Caroline coldly,  ignoring the interruption.    Maud faced her defiantly. She looked like a princess in captivity  facing her gaolers.    \"I don't care. I love him, and I always shall love him, and nothing  is ever going to stop me loving him--because I love him,\" she  concluded a little lamely.    \"Nonsense,\" said Lady Caroline. \"In a year from now you will have  forgotten his name. Don't you agree with me, Percy?\"    \"Quite,\" said Lord Belpher.    \"I shan't.\"    \"Deuced hard things to remember, names,\" said Lord Marshmoreton.  \"If I've tried once to remember that tobacconist girl's name, I've  tried a hundred times. I have an idea it began with an 'L.' Muriel  or Hilda or something.\"    \"Within a year,\" said Lady Caroline, \"you will be wondering how you  ever came to be so foolish. Don't you think so, Percy?\"    \"Quite,\" said Lord Belpher.    Lord Marshmoreton turned on him irritably.    \"Good God, boy, can't you answer a simple question with a plain  affirmative? What do you mean--quite? If somebody came to me and  pointed you out and said, 'Is that your son?' do you suppose I  should say 'Quite?' I wish the devil you didn't collect prayer  rugs. It's sapped your brain.\"    \"They say prison life often weakens the intellect, father,\" said  Maud. She moved towards the door and turned the handle. Albert,  the page boy, who had been courting earache by listening at the  keyhole, straightened his small body and scuttled away. \"Well, is  that all, Aunt Caroline? May I go now?\"    \"Certainly. I have said all I wished to say.\"    \"Very well. I'm sorry to disobey you, but I can't help it.\"    \"You'll find you can help it after you've been cooped up here for a  few more months,\" said Percy.    A gentle smile played over Maud's face.    \"Love laughs at locksmiths,\" she murmured softly, and passed from  the room.    \"What did she say?\" asked Lord Marshmoreton, interested.  \"Something about somebody laughing at a locksmith? I don't  understand. Why should anyone laugh at locksmiths? Most respectable  men. Had one up here only the day before yesterday, forcing open  the drawer of my desk. Watched him do it. Most interesting. He  smelt rather strongly of a damned bad brand of tobacco. Fellow must  have a throat of leather to be able to smoke the stuff. But he  didn't strike me as an object of derision. From first to last, I  was never tempted to laugh once.\"    Lord Belpher wandered moodily to the window and looked out into the  gathering darkness.    \"And this has to happen,\" he said bitterly, \"on the eve of my  twenty-first birthday.\"        CHAPTER 7.    The first requisite of an invading army is a base. George, having  entered Belpher village and thus accomplished the first stage in  his foreward movement on the castle, selected as his base the  Marshmoreton Arms. Selected is perhaps hardly the right word, as it  implies choice, and in George's case there was no choice. There are  two inns at Belpher, but the Marshmoreton Arms is the only one that  offers accommodation for man and beast, assuming--that is to say--that  the man and beast desire to spend the night. The other house, the Blue  Boar, is a mere beerhouse, where the lower strata of Belpher society  gather of a night to "]]]
