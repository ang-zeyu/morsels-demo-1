Theoretically, this might very well happen.  Cadmium yellow is composed of cadmium and sulphur--white lead of lead  and carbonic acid. If the former parted with some of its sulphur to the  latter, sulphide of lead would result, which is black. Hence, the partly  decomposed yellow and white would be mixed with black, and there would  be formed a blackish-yellow or a yellowish-black. Again, if the cadmium  parted with the whole of its sulphur to the lead, receiving in exchange  the carbonic acid of the latter, a mixture of black sulphide of lead  with white carbonate of cadmium would be furnished, the result being a  grey. Perhaps the following rough diagram may serve to make our meaning  plainer:--        Cadmium Yellow {Cadmium.    __________ Carbonate of Cadmium (White.)                   {Sulphur.             /                             \\          /                              \\        /                               \\      /                                \\    /                                 \\  /                                  \\/                                  /\\                             ____/__\\    White Lead {Lead.           /          Sulphide of Lead (Black.)               {Carbonic Acid.    Such is the theory of the reaction which might take place, but which, as  far as our own experience goes, does not. Some deep cadmium yellow which  we ourselves prepared was intimately mixed and ground with an equal  quantity by weight of Cremnitz white, and an oil rub of the compound  laid upon a tile. Having placed the latter on a shelf in the laboratory,  we watched from week to week to see if any approach to blackness  occurred, any diminution in the beauty of the tint; but could perceive  none. Hence, while admitting the possibility of the colour being  damaged or destroyed in the case of an inferior and spurious article, we  conclude that an unadulterated cadmium yellow, containing no free  sulphur, neither injures, nor is injured by, white lead, and may safely  be used therewith. At the same time, the artist should be warned to  satisfy himself of the genuineness of his pigment, or otherwise to  employ the white of zinc, at least as a medium of intervention.    A good sample of cadmium yellow may rather advantageously than otherwise  be compounded with white lead, for we have found that a mixture of equal  parts by weight of the two will bear an atmosphere of sulphuretted  hydrogen that completely blackens the white alone.    With all the sulphides of cadmium a steel palette knife is best avoided.    22. PALE CADMIUM.    The cadmium yellow so-called, is not strictly pale, but pale only when  compared with the preceding. It is, in fact, a full rich colour,  brilliant and permanent, but without that tendency to orange which  distinguishes the deep. For some purposes, when a warm tone is not  required, such a tint is preferable. In water, especially, where  delicacy of colouring can be carried to a greater degree of refinement  than in oil, these differences of hue are important. In the first  medium the faint washes show with a clearness which is not so apparent  in the last, and the most subtle gradation of tone tells with a force in  some measure lost in oil. As a consequence, the colour of the lightest  tints in the distance must be as true as that of the deepest shades in  the foreground, and hence the warmth or coldness of the pale washes of a  pigment should be duly considered.    Pale cadmium yellow with or without aureolin, is adapted for golden  sunsets, and yields with French blue a beautiful sea-green.    24. LEMON CADMIUM.    Very pale cadmium yellows are not permanent, and lemon cadmiums are  decidedly fugitive. Being, like the deep and 'pale' varieties,  sulphides, they are of course unaltered by sulphurous gas; but they will  not stand exposure to light and air, or even to light alone. Some which  were submitted in an air-tight bottle to the action of light gradually  whitened next the glass. Yet they were almost identical in composition  with the deepest and most orange hues, and might have reasonably been  presumed stable. Repeated experiments, however, both with samples of our  own making and of others' manufacture, have shown that for a cadmium to  be durable, it must be of a full, rich, comparatively deep yellow; and  that any paler product than the 'pale' alluded to cannot be depended  on. It is true that a light or lemon tint will fade quicker in water  than in oil, but a colour which is fugitive in the one vehicle cannot be  regarded as eligible in the other. From a somewhat long acquaintance  with cadmiums, we have derived the opinion that their stability rests  much on the mode of preparation, and that an amount of heat is needed  sufficient to make the sulphur _bite into_ the base. This opinion,  indeed, extends to all metallic sulphides, and our belief is, that if  vermilions were made generally by wet processes, they would not be found  the permanent pigments they undoubtedly are.    25. MUTRIE YELLOW.    Under this name a lemon sulphide of cadmium has lately appeared, to  which the foregoing remarks are applicable. A water colour rub on  exposure to air and light faded rapidly, no trace of yellow remaining in  the pale wash. The sample which came under our notice contained a  quantity of free sulphur.    It is to be regretted that these lemon cadmiums are fugacious, so  bright, so clear, are they, and of so pure a lemon tint can they be  obtained. But as no beauty of colour compensates for want of durability,  their place should be supplied by lemon yellow proper, or chromate of  baryta.    26. CHROME YELLOWS,    Also called _Jaune Minérale_, _Jaune de Cologne_ or _Cologne Yellow_,  _Pale Chrome_, and _Deep Chrome_, are chromates of lead, in which the  latter metal more or less exists, according to the paleness or depth of  the colour. Of modern introduction, they are distinguished for their  brilliancy, their opacity and body, and their going cordially into tint  with white, both in water and oil. Owing, however, to a harshness and  hardness of tone for which they are peculiar, a coarse and disagreeable  effect is apt to be produced by their use. In general, they do not  accord with the modest hues of nature, nor harmonize well with the  softer beauty of other colours. Rivalling the cadmiums in brightness,  they are wanting in the mellow richness which belongs to the deeper  varieties of those pigments, as well as in their permanency. Although  they resist the sun's rays for a lengthened period, after some time they  lose their original hue, whether employed alone or in tint, and may even  become black in impure air. Upon several pigments they produce serious  changes, ultimately destroying Prussian and Antwerp blues, when  compounded therewith in the composition of greens, &c. Ranging from  lemon to deep yellow, in oil, provided the atmosphere be good, the  chromes may be found comparatively durable; but, on the whole, the  artist cannot trust to them his reputation as a colourist.    The chromates are often mixed with sulphate of lead, as well as with the  sulphates of baryta and lime. The presence of the first is especially  objectionable, as increasing the tendency of the yellows to be blackened  by foul gas. The sulphates of baryta and lime, however, are sometimes  formed in the process of preparation, in which case they are rather an  advantage than otherwise; inasmuch as they not only lend a softness to  the colour, but decrease the proportion of leaden base, and consequently  the tendency referred to. We may remark, indeed, with respect to  pigments, that it is difficult in many instances to say where  manufacture ends and adulteration begins. A substance may be present  which, although not absolutely essential to the colour itself, has been  legitimately employed to impart a desired quality, or a certain tint.    27. COLOGNE YELLOW    Is a cheap inferior chrome yellow, unfit for artistic purposes, and  consists of twenty-five parts of chromate of lead, fifteen of sulphate  of lead, and sixty of sulphate of lime.    28. JAUNE MINERALE    Is prepared in Paris, and differs in no essential particular from  ordinary chromate of lead, except in the paleness of its colour. The  chrome yellows have also obtained other names from places or persons,  whence they have been brought or by whom they have been made. Another  lead yellow, not a chromate, has likewise been called jaune minérale.    29. CITRON YELLOW    Is chromate of zinc, a bright pale lemon-like yellow, slightly soluble  in water. It is not affected by foul gas, but does not preserve its  colour on exposure to light and air, or even when kept in a book. In  contact with organic substances it is apt to turn green. Compounded,  especially for foliage tints, this yellow is eligible; but if purity of  hue be desired, it should certainly not be employed alone. In this  chromate, as in many others, the affinity of the chromic acid to the  base is small; the former is liable to separate from the latter, and, by  deoxidation, to become converted into green oxide of chromium.    30. GALLSTONE    Is a deep-toned gorgeous yellow, affording richer tints than most other  yellows, but it cannot be depended on for permanency, and therefore is  seldom employed. Its colour is soon changed and destroyed by strong  light, though not subject to alteration by impure air. In oil it is  ineligible. A true gallstone is an animal calculus formed in the  gall-bladder, chiefly of oxen; but the pigment sold under that name is  often replaced by a substitute, resembling the original in colour, but  of greater stability.    31. GAMBOGE,    Sometimes designated _Drop Gum_, and variously written _Gamboge_,  _Camboge_, _Gamboage_, _Cambogia_, _Cambadium_, _Cambogium_,  _Gambodium_, _Gambogium_, &c., is the produce of several kinds of trees.

Is it possible that thou dost not believe  me after the solemn oath I have taken?\" \"Truly not I,\" said the  fisherman; \"nor will I believe you, unless you go into the vessel  again.\"    Upon this the body of the genie dissolved and changed itself into smoke,  extending as before upon the seashore; and at last being collected, it  began to re-enter the vessel, which it continued to do by a slow and  equal motion, till no part remained out; when immediately a voice came  forth, which said to the fisherman: \"Well, incredulous fellow, dost thou  not believe me now?\"    The fisherman, instead of answering the genie, took the cover of lead,  and having speedily replaced it on the vessel, \"Genie,\" cried he, \"now  it is your turn to beg my favour, and to choose which way I shall put  you to death; but it is better that I should throw you into the sea,  whence I took you: and then I will build a house upon the shore, where I  will reside and give notice to all fishermen who come to throw in their  nets, to beware of such a wicked genie as you are, who have made an oath  to kill him that shall set you at liberty.\"    The genie, enraged at these expressions, struggled to free himself; but  it was impossible, for the impression of Solomon's seal prevented him.  Perceiving that the fisherman had the advantage of him, he thought fit  to dissemble his anger; \"Fisherman,\" said he, \"take heed you do not what  you threaten; for what I spoke to you was only by way of jest.\" \"O  genie!\" replied the fisherman, \"thou who wast but a moment ago the  greatest of all genies, and now art the least of them, thy crafty  discourse will signify nothing, to the sea thou shalt return. If thou  hast been there already so long as thou hast told me, thou mayest very  well stay there till the day of judgment. I begged of thee, in God's  name, not to take away my life, and thou didst reject my prayers; I am  obliged to treat thee in the same manner.\"    The genie omitted nothing that he thought likely to prevail with the  fisherman: \"Open the vessel,\" said he, \"give me my liberty, and I  promise to satisfy you to your own content.\" \"Thou art a traitor,\"  replied the fisherman, \"I should deserve to lose my life, if I were such  a fool as to trust thee.\"    \"My good fisherman,\" replied the genie, \"I conjure you once more not to  be guilty of such cruelty; consider that it is not good to avenge one's  self, and that, on the other hand, it is commendable to do good for  evil; do not treat me as Imama formerly treated Ateca.\" \"And what did  Imama to Ateca?\" inquired the fisherman. \"Ho!\" cried the genie, \"if you  have a mind to be informed, open the vessel: do you think that I can be  in a humour to relate stories in so strait a prison? I will tell you as  many as you please, when you have let me out.\" \"No,\" said the fisherman,  \"I will not let thee out; it is in vain to talk of it; I am just going  to throw thee into the bottom of the sea.\" \"Hear me one word more,\"  cried the genie; \"I promise to do you no hurt; nay, far from that, I  will show you a way to become exceedingly rich.\"    The hope of delivering himself from poverty prevailed with the  fisherman. \"I could listen to thee,\" said he, \"were there any credit to  be given to thy word; swear to me, by the great name of God, that thou  wilt faithfully perform what thou promisest, and I will open the vessel;  I do not believe thou wilt dare to break such an oath.\"    The genie swore to him, upon which the fisherman immediately took off  the covering of the vessel. At that instant the smoke ascended, and the  genie, having resumed his form, the first thing he did was to kick the  vessel into the sea. This action alarmed the fisherman. \"Genie,\" said  he, \"will not you keep the oath you just now made?\"    The genie laughed at his fear, and answered: \"Fisherman, be not afraid,  I only did it to divert myself, and to see if you would be alarmed at  it; but to convince you that I am in earnest, take your nets and follow  me.\" As he spoke these words, he walked before the fisherman, who having  taken up his nets, followed him, but with some distrust. They passed by  the town, and came to the top of a mountain, from whence they descended  into a vast plain, which brought them to a lake that lay betwixt four  hills.    When they reached the side of the lake, the genie said to the fisherman:  \"Cast in your nets and catch fish.\" The fisherman did not doubt of  taking some, because he saw a great number in the water; but he was  extremely surprised when he found they were of four colours; white, red,  blue, and yellow. He threw in his nets and brought out one of each  colour. Having never seen the like before, he could not but admire them,  and, judging that he might get a considerable sum for them, he was very  joyful. \"Carry those fish,\" said the genie to him, \"and present them to  your sultan; he will give you more money for them. You may come daily to  fish in this lake; but I give you warning not to throw in your nets  above once a day, otherwise you will repent.\" Having spoken thus, he  struck his foot upon the ground, which opened, and after it had  swallowed him up, closed again.    The fisherman, being resolved to follow the genie's advice, forbore  casting in his nets a second time, and returned to the town very well  satisfied, and making a thousand reflections upon his adventure. He went  immediately to the sultan's palace to offer his fish, and his majesty  was much surprised when he saw the wonders which the fisherman  presented. He took them up one after another, and viewed them with  attention; and after having admired them a long time, \"Take those fish,\"  said he to his vizier, \"and carry them to the cook whom the emperor of  the Greeks has sent me. I cannot imagine but that they must be as good  as they are beautiful.\"    The vizier carried them as he was directed, and delivering them to the  cook, said: \"Here are four fish just brought to the sultan; he orders  you to dress them.\" He then returned to the sultan, who commanded him to  give the fisherman four hundred pieces of gold, which he did  accordingly.    The fisherman, who had never seen so much money, could scarcely believe  his good fortune, but thought the whole must be a dream, until he found  it otherwise, by being able to provide necessaries for his family with  the produce of his nets.    As soon as the sultan's cook had cleaned the fish, she put them upon the  fire in a frying-pan, with oil, and when she thought them fried enough  on one side, she turned them upon the other; but, O monstrous prodigy!  scarcely were they turned, when the wall of the kitchen divided, and a  young lady of wonderful beauty entered from the opening. She held a rod  in her hand and was clad in flowered satin, with pendants in her ears, a  necklace of large pearls, and bracelets of gold set with rubies. She  moved toward the frying-pan, to the great amazement of the cook, and  striking one of the fish with the end of the rod, said: \"Fish, fish, are  you in your duty?\" The fish having answered nothing, she repeated these  words, and then the four fish lifted up their heads, and replied: \"Yes,  yes: if you reckon, we reckon; if you pay your debts, we pay ours; if  you fly, we overcome, and are content.\" As soon as they had finished  these words, the lady overturned the frying-pan, and returned into the  open part of the wall, which closed immediately, and became as it was  before.    The cook was greatly frightened at what had happened, and coming a  little to herself went to take up the fish that had fallen on the  hearth, but found them blacker than coal and not fit to be carried to  the sultan. This grievously troubled her, and she fell to weeping most  bitterly. \"Alas!\" said she, \"what will become of me? If I tell the  sultan what I have seen, I am sure he will not believe me, but will be  enraged against me.\"    While she was thus bewailing herself, the grand vizier entered, and  asked her if the fish were ready. She told him all that had occurred,  which we may easily imagine astonished him; but without speaking a word  of it to the sultan he invented an excuse that satisfied him, and  sending immediately for the fisherman bid him bring four more such fish,  for a misfortune had befallen the others, so that they were not fit to  be carried to the royal table. The fisherman, without saying anything of  what the genie had told him, told the vizier he had a great way to go  for them, in order to excuse himself from bringing them that day, but  said that he would certainly bring them on the morrow.    Accordingly the fisherman went away by night, and coming to the lake,  threw in his nets betimes next morning, took four fish like the former,  and brought them to the vizier at the hour appointed. The minister took  them himself, carried them to the kitchen, and shutting himself up with  the cook, she cleaned them and put them on the fire. When they were  fried on one side, and she had turned them upon the other, the kitchen  wall again opened, and the same lady came in with the rod in her hand,  struck one of the fish, spoke to it as before, and all four gave her the  same answer.    After they had spoken to the young lady, she overturned the"]]]
