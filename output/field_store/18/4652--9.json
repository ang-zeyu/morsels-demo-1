Every living thing stirs in its  sleep,--birds and bees, flowers and trees, animals and men. When I  speak, the sleeping sun awakes. See! already he begins to send down his  arrows. Hasten! that they may not find you, on the trail to the North  Sky.\"    The Old Man trembled. His legs and arms grew weak. Icicles fell from his  beard. Great tears rolled down his cheeks.    \"Who are you?\" he whispered, as he was melting at the young chieftain's  feet.    \"I am _Go hay_--the Spring,\" answered the young chieftain. \"All the  earth is glad, when I come to drive you back to your lodge in the North  Sky, for I bring sunshine, and love, and joy.\"    But the Old Man did not hear. He was far on the North Sky trail, and  Spring and South Wind were masters of earth.    [Illustration]          WHY LIGHTNING SOMETIMES STRIKES      An old man of the Iroquois nation once wished to make a beautiful Indian  maiden his wife. The old man had many rare furs and valued strings of  wampum. These he brought and laid at the door of the wigwam where the  maiden lived.    [Illustration]    The father and mother were pleased with the old man's gifts. They told  him that when the Planting Moon should come, the maiden should go to his  wigwam.    Now the maiden did not love the old man. She did not wish him to make  her his wife. \"I will never sit at his wigwam door,\" she said.    It was midwinter, when the old man brought the gifts, the time of the  pale, cold moon. From that time, the maiden watched, with a heavy heart,  the moons wax and wane.    At last the snows disappeared. No more was the North Wind heard  shrieking about the lodge. The gentle South Wind had come, bringing with  him the singing birds.    The little brooks awoke and sang. They were happy that spring had come,  and all the earth children were glad,--except the maiden. Her heart grew  more heavy and sad, as the face of the sun grew brighter.    Then the Planting Moon came. The maiden watched the moon hang her horn  in the sky. Then she ran swiftly to the great river that flowed not far  from the lodge. Lightly she sprang into her canoe. A few quick strokes,  and the canoe was in midstream.    The current ran swift and strong. The little craft was carried swiftly  down the river toward the great falls known as Niagara Falls. As the  canoe neared the falls, the maiden was seen to rise and stretch out her  arms, as though about to leap. A smile was on her face, and a song was  on her lips, as the canoe shot into the mist that overhung the water.    Then, from the caverns below a dark blanket floated upward, as though  spread to catch the maiden. It was Heno, the Thunder Spirit, who dwelt  behind the falls. He had caught her in the folds of his blanket, and  had saved her from the great rocks below.    [Illustration]    Heno took the maiden to live with him, in his lodge behind the falls.  There she was very happy, so happy that her smile shone through the  mist, and the Indians cried, \"See! A rainbow!\"    In her new home the maiden learned many wonderful things. She found she  possessed strange powers, not known to her before. She could float on a  cloud at will, and she seemed filled with a strange fire.    One day, the young woman was given a son. Heno and she were very happy.  Many moons the mother and child played together. When Heno was away on  one of his journeys through the sky, they would ride the great bubbles  of foam that went dashing through the rocks. Sometimes they would catch  sunbeams in a net, as they sat on the edge of a cloud and fished.    One day, Heno asked the young woman if she would like to visit her  people.    \"If you wish,\" he said, \"you shall return for a time, taking our son  with you. But remember, both of you possess powers unknown to the earth  children. Be careful how you use them. Never let another child strike  the boy, for that child would at once wither and die. Never strike the  boy yourself, for he would fall stunned to earth.\"    [Illustration: CRADLE BOARD]    The woman listened to Heno's words. Soon they were wrapped in his great  cloud blanket, and were floating over the river. When they came to the  home of her people, Heno left the woman and the boy by the river, and  went on further to the east.    The people were glad to see the woman, whom they had mourned as dead.  She told them of the wonderful things she had learned in her new home.  She told them also how Heno was freeing their land of a monster serpent,  that trailed underneath the earth, poisoning their springs and causing  sickness. Always, she said, Heno carried a basket of great rocks on his  back, which he hurled at the monster whenever he saw him. Soon he would  kill the serpent, and they would be sick no more.    During many days, the mother and the little boy stayed with the earth  people. Sometimes, when the child was playing by the river, he would see  a dark cloud approaching. Then he would clap his hands with joy and cry,  \"There comes my father!\"    The black cloud would float earthward, and Heno would stop and have a  word with the mother and the boy. As he left them he always said, \"Do  not let anyone strike the boy.\"    But one day, the mother did not watch the boy, and he fell to playing  with some earth children. They grew angry as they played, and struck the  boy. Instantly these earth children fell dead to the ground. Then the  mother laid hands on the boy, to punish him, and he fell to earth.    At this, there came a great rumbling and roaring through the sky, and  Heno appeared. He took the lifeless child in his arms, crying, \"You have  disobeyed. No longer shall you have this great power I gave you. You  shall remain on earth and be simply an earth woman. I will take the boy  to my abode. Henceforth, our lodge shall be in the sky. There he will  return to life, and ever after he will go with me on my journeys through  the sky.\"    Then the sky shook and trembled. The door of the sky lodge opened, and  Heno and the boy were seen no more.    Now, when a rumbling and rolling through the sky is heard, the Indians  say, \"'Tis the voice of Heno! He is coming from his lodge in the sky!\"    But when a flash of fire is seen, and a loud crash is heard, they say,  \"That is the boy! He is trying to hit the earth children with a fire  stone. He remembers how they struck him, a long time ago.\"    [Illustration]          WHY THE HARE HAS A SPLIT LIP AND SHORT TAIL      Once a rabbit began to run back and forth through the woods, calling for  snow, snow, snow! It was one of those large gray rabbits, with long  ears, that people call hares.    As this hare ran back and forth through the woods, he sang at the top of  his voice, \"_Ah gon ne yah--yeh! Ah gon ne yah-yeh! Ah gon ne yah--yeh!  dah gen, dah ton, Ah gon ne yah--yeh! Ah gon ne yah--yeh!_\" This meant,  \"Snow, snow, snow! How I would run if I had snow! Snow, snow, snow! How  I would run if I had snow!\"    Now, strange as it may seem, as this hare ran back and forth singing for  snow, snow, snow, some flakes of snow began to fall. The hare was so  delighted that he jumped up and down for joy.    \"_Ah gon ne yah--yeh! Ah gon ne yah--yeh! Ah gon ne yah--yeh!_\" he sang,  in short, quick notes of joy. And the higher he jumped, and the louder  he sang, the faster and thicker the snow came.    The hare was so delighted that he again began to run. All day long he  ran, back and forth through the woods, calling for \"Snow, snow, snow!  How I would run if I had snow!\" And the snow fell faster and faster.  Thicker and thicker it came. The path in which the rabbit ran grew  higher and higher, as the snow fell deeper and deeper.    But at last the hare was so tired that he could run no longer. He no  longer sang for \"Snow, snow, snow! How I would run if I had snow,\" for  he now had more snow than he wanted. The snow was up to the tiptops of  the trees, and it was very hard to run.    The hare was very tired. He thought he must take a rest. Night was  coming on. He looked about him. Near the path were the top branches of a  willow tree, sticking out above the snow. He sprang into a crotch of  those branches. There he could sit and rest for a time. Soon he fell  asleep. He slept all night and part of the next day.    That night it began to rain, and it rained very, very hard. The snow  began to melt, and it melted very, very fast, and when that hare awoke,  not a flake of snow was to be seen!    But there was the hare away up in the tiptop of that willow tree! What  to do he did not know. He was very hungry. He wondered how long he could  stay there and not starve. He saw some tender buds on the branches. He  ate those, and then he gnawed bark for a time.    However, sooner or later, the hare knew he must jump or starve. He  looked down at the earth. It looked very good to him. He could see some  fresh green moss and some beautiful grass. One jump, and they were his!  But what a jump!    At last the hare whipped his courage up to the jumping point. He shut  his eyes, and gave one great jump to earth. But when he jumped, he  caught his tail on the branch of the willow tree and left part of it up  there. And when he jumped, he struck the front of his face on a sharp  stone, and the stone split his upper lip in two.    Ever since then, hares have had split lips and short tails, and ever  since then, willow trees have had tails, or catkins, on them, in the  spring.          CORN PLUME AND BEAN MAIDEN      The Great Spirit had smiled upon his Red Children. The land was filled  with plenty, for the Great Spirit had given to them the three sustainers  of life, the corn, the bean, and the squash. Flowers bloomed, birds  sang, and all the earth was glad with the Red Children, for the gifts of  the Great Spirit.    On one side of a hill grew the tall, waving corn, with its silk tassels  and plumes. On another side, beans, with their velvety pods,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/221"],[0,"The Return of Sherlock Holmes (#12)"],[1,"er.\"    He was a fine creature, this man of the old English soil, simple,  straight, and gentle, with his great, earnest blue eyes and broad,  comely face. His love for his wife and his trust in her shone in his  features. Holmes had listened to his story with the utmost attention,  and now he sat for some time in silent thought.    \"Don't you think, Mr. Cubitt,\" said he, at last, \"that your best plan  would be to make a direct appeal to your wife, and to ask her to share  her secret with you?\"    Hilton Cubitt shook his massive head.    \"A promise is a promise, Mr. Holmes. If Elsie wished to tell me she  would. If not, it is not for me to force her confidence. But I am  justified in taking my own line--and I will.\"    \"Then I will help you with all my heart. In the first place, have you  heard of any strangers being seen in your neighbourhood?\"    \"No.\"    \"I presume that it is a very quiet place. Any fresh face would cause  comment?\"    \"In the immediate neighbourhood, yes. But we have several small  watering-places not very far away. And the farmers take in lodgers.\"    \"These hieroglyphics have evidently a meaning. If it is a purely  arbitrary one it may be impossible for us to solve it. If, on the other  hand, it is systematic, I have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom  of it. But this particular sample is so short that I can do nothing, and  the facts which you have brought me are so indefinite that we have no  basis for an investigation. I would suggest that you return to Norfolk,  that you keep a keen look-out, and that you take an exact copy of any  fresh dancing men which may appear. It is a thousand pities that we  have not a reproduction of those which were done in chalk upon the  window-sill. Make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in the  neighbourhood. When you have collected some fresh evidence come to me  again. That is the best advice which I can give you, Mr. Hilton Cubitt.  If there are any pressing fresh developments I shall be always ready to  run down and see you in your Norfolk home.\"    The interview left Sherlock Holmes very thoughtful, and several times  in the next few days I saw him take his slip of paper from his note-book  and look long and earnestly at the curious figures inscribed upon it. He  made no allusion to the affair, however, until one afternoon a fortnight  or so later. I was going out when he called me back.    \"You had better stay here, Watson.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because I had a wire from Hilton Cubitt this morning--you remember  Hilton Cubitt, of the dancing men? He was to reach Liverpool Street at  one-twenty. He may be here at any moment. I gather from his wire that  there have been some new incidents of importance.\"    We had not long to wait, for our Norfolk squire came straight from the  station as fast as a hansom could bring him. He was looking worried and  depressed, with tired eyes and a lined forehead.    \"It's getting on my nerves, this business, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, as he  sank, like a wearied man, into an arm-chair. \"It's bad enough to feel  that you are surrounded by unseen, unknown folk, who have some kind of  design upon you; but when, in addition to that, you know that it is just  killing your wife by inches, then it becomes as much as flesh and blood  can endure. She's wearing away under it--just wearing away before my  eyes.\"    \"Has she said anything yet?\"    \"No, Mr. Holmes, she has not. And yet there have been times when the  poor girl has wanted to speak, and yet could not quite bring herself  to take the plunge. I have tried to help her; but I dare say I did  it clumsily, and scared her off from it. She has spoken about my old  family, and our reputation in the county, and our pride in our unsullied  honour, and I always felt it was leading to the point; but somehow it  turned off before we got there.\"    \"But you have found out something for yourself?\"    \"A good deal, Mr. Holmes. I have several fresh dancing men pictures for  you to examine, and, what is more important, I have seen the fellow.\"    \"What, the man who draws them?\"    \"Yes, I saw him at his work. But I will tell you everything in order.  When I got back after my visit to you, the very first thing I saw next  morning was a fresh crop of dancing men. They had been drawn in chalk  upon the black wooden door of the tool-house, which stands beside the  lawn in full view of the front windows. I took an exact copy, and here  it is.\" He unfolded a paper and laid it upon the table. Here is a copy  of the hieroglyphics:--    GRAPHIC    \"Excellent!\" said Holmes. \"Excellent! Pray continue.\"    \"When I had taken the copy I rubbed out the marks; but two mornings  later a fresh inscription had appeared. I have a copy of it here\":--    GRAPHIC    Holmes rubbed his hands and chuckled with delight.    \"Our material is rapidly accumulating,\" said he.    \"Three days later a message was left scrawled upon paper, and placed  under a pebble upon the sun-dial. Here it is. The characters are, as you  see, exactly the same as the last one. After that I determined to lie in  wait; so I got out my revolver and I sat up in my study, which overlooks  the lawn and garden. About two in the morning I was seated by the  window, all being dark save for the moonlight outside, when I heard  steps behind me, and there was my wife in her dressing-gown. She  implored me to come to bed. I told her frankly that I wished to see who  it was who played such absurd tricks upon us. She answered that it was  some senseless practical joke, and that I should not take any notice of  it.    \"'If it really annoys you, Hilton, we might go and travel, you and I,  and so avoid this nuisance.'    \"'What, be driven out of our own house by a practical joker?' said I.  'Why, we should have the whole county laughing at us.'    \"'Well, come to bed,' said she, 'and we can discuss it in the morning.'    \"Suddenly, as she spoke, I saw her white face grow whiter yet in the  moonlight, and her hand tightened upon my shoulder. Something was moving  in the shadow of the tool-house. I saw a dark, creeping figure which  crawled round the corner and squatted in front of the door. Seizing my  pistol I was rushing out, when my wife threw her arms round me and held  me with convulsive strength. I tried to throw her off, but she clung to  me most desperately. At last I got clear, but by the time I had opened  the door and reached the house the creature was gone. He had left a  trace of his presence, however, for there on the door was the very same  arrangement of dancing men which had already twice appeared, and which  I have copied on that paper. There was no other sign of the fellow  anywhere, though I ran all over the grounds. And yet the amazing thing  is that he must have been there all the time, for when I examined the  door again in the morning he had scrawled some more of his pictures  under the line which I had already seen.\"    \"Have you that fresh drawing?\"    \"Yes; it is very short, but I made a copy of it, and here it is.\"    Again he produced a paper. The new dance was in this form:--    GRAPHIC    \"Tell me,\" said Holmes--and I could see by his eyes that he was much  excited--\"was this a mere addition to the first, or did it appear to be  entirely separate?\"    \"It was on a different panel of the door.\"    \"Excellent! This is far the most important of all for our purpose. It  fills me with hopes. Now, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, please continue your most  interesting statement.\"    \"I have nothing more to say, Mr. Holmes, except that I was angry with  my wife that night for having held me back when I might have caught the  skulking rascal. She said that she feared that I might come to harm. For  an instant it had crossed my mind that perhaps what she really feared  was that HE might come to harm, for I could not doubt that she knew who  this man was and what he meant by these strange signals. But there is a  tone in my wife's voice, Mr. Holmes, and a look in her eyes which forbid  doubt, and I am sure that it was indeed my own safety that was in her  mind. There's the whole case, and now I want your advice as to what I  ought to do. My own inclination is to put half-a-dozen of my farm lads  in the shrubbery, and when this fellow comes again to give him such a  hiding that he will leave us in peace for the future.\"    \"I fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies,\" said Holmes.  \"How long can you stay in London?\"    \"I must go back to-day. I would not leave my wife alone all night for  anything. She is very nervous and begged me to come back.\"    \"I dare say you are right. But if you could have stopped I might  possibly have been able to return with you in a day or two. Meanwhile  you will leave me these papers, and I think that it is very likely that  I shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to throw some light upon  your case.\"    Sherlock Holmes preserved his calm professional manner until our visitor  had left us, although it was easy for me, who knew him so well, to see  that he was profoundly excited. The moment that Hilton Cubitt's broad  back had disappeared through the door my comrade rushed to the table,  laid out all the slips of paper containing dancing men in front of him,  and threw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation. For  two hours I watched him as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with  figures and letters, so completely absorbed in his task that he had  evidently forgotten my presence. Sometimes he was making progress and  whistled and sang at his work; sometimes he was puzzled, and would sit  for long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye. Finally he sprang  from his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and walked up and down the  room rubbing his hands together. Then he wrote a long telegram upon a  cable form. \"If my answer to this is as I hope, you will have a very  pretty case to add to your collection, Watson,\" said he. \"I expect that  we shall be able to go down to"]]]
