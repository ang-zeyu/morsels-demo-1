This eternal bond should be made secure by a firm  covenant, and the intention should be to foster harmony, fellowship and  unity and to attain everlasting life.\"    --'Abdu'l-Baha    The pledge of marriage, the verse to be spoken individually by the bride  and the bridegroom in the presence of at least two witnesses acceptable to  the Spiritual Assembly is, as stipulated in the Kitab-i-Aqdas (The Most  Holy Book):    \"We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God.\"    He is the Bestower, the Bounteous!    Praise be to God, the Ancient, the Ever-Abiding, the Changeless, the  Eternal! He Who hath testified in His Own Being that verily He is the One,  the Single, the Untrammelled, the Exalted. We bear witness that verily  there is no God but Him, acknowledging His oneness, confessing His  singleness. He hath ever dwelt in unapproachable heights, in the summits  of His loftiness, sanctified from the mention of aught save Himself, free  from the description of aught but Him.    And when He desired to manifest grace and beneficence to men, and to set  the world in order, He revealed observances and created laws; among them  He established the law of marriage, made it as a fortress for well-being  and salvation, and enjoined it upon us in that which was sent down out of  the heaven of sanctity in His Most Holy Book. He saith, great is His  glory: \"Marry, O people, that from you may appear he who will remember Me  amongst My servants; this is one of My commandments unto you; obey it as  an assistance to yourselves.\"    --Baha'u'llah        \"He is God!...\"      He is God!    O peerless Lord! In Thine almighty wisdom Thou hast enjoined marriage upon  the peoples, that the generations of men may succeed one another in this  contingent world, and that ever, so long as the world shall last, they may  busy themselves at the Threshold of Thy oneness with servitude and  worship, with salutation, adoration and praise. \"I have not created  spirits and men, but that they should worship me.\"(4) Wherefore, wed Thou  in the heaven of Thy mercy these two birds of the nest of Thy love, and  make them the means of attracting perpetual grace; that from the union of  these two seas of love a wave of tenderness may surge and cast the pearls  of pure and goodly issue on the shore of life. \"He hath let loose the two  seas, that they meet each other: Between them is a barrier which they  overpass not. Which then of the bounties of your Lord will ye deny? From  each He bringeth up greater and lesser pearls.\"(5)    O Thou kind Lord! Make Thou this marriage to bring forth coral and pearls.  Thou art verily the All-Powerful, the Most Great, the Ever-Forgiving.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Verily, this...\"      Glory be unto Thee, O my God! Verily, this Thy servant and this Thy  maidservant have gathered under the shadow of Thy mercy and they are  united through Thy favor and generosity. O Lord! Assist them in this Thy  world and Thy kingdom and destine for them every good through Thy bounty  and grace. O Lord! Confirm them in Thy servitude and assist them in Thy  service. Suffer them to become the signs of Thy Name in Thy world and  protect them through Thy bestowals which are inexhaustible in this world  and the world to come. O Lord! They are supplicating the kingdom of Thy  mercifulness and invoking the realm of Thy singleness. Verily, they are  married in obedience to Thy command. Cause them to become the signs of  harmony and unity until the end of time. Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent,  the Omnipresent and the Almighty!    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O my Lord, O my Lord! These two bright...\"      O my Lord, O my Lord! These two bright orbs are wedded in Thy love,  conjoined in servitude to Thy Holy Threshold, united in ministering to Thy  Cause. Make Thou this marriage to be as threading lights of Thine  abounding grace, O my Lord, the All-Merciful, the luminous rays of Thy  bestowals, O Thou the Beneficent, the Ever-Giving, that there may branch  out from this great tree boughs that will grow green and flourishing  through the gifts that rain down from Thy clouds of grace.    Verily, Thou art the Generous. Verily, Thou art the Almighty. Verily, Thou  art the Compassionate, the All-Merciful.    --'Abdu'l-Baha          MEETINGS        \"Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I implore...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I implore Thee by the onrushing winds  of Thy grace, and by them Who are the Daysprings of Thy purpose and the  Dawning-Places of Thine inspiration, to send down upon me and upon all  that have sought Thy face that which beseemeth Thy generosity and  bountiful grace, and is worthy of Thy bestowals and favors. Poor and  desolate I am, O my Lord! Immerse me in the ocean of Thy wealth; athirst,  suffer me to drink from the living waters of Thy loving-kindness.    I beseech Thee, by Thine own Self and by Him Whom Thou hast appointed as  the Manifestation of Thine own Being and Thy discriminating Word unto all  that are in heaven and on earth, to gather together Thy servants beneath  the shade of the Tree of Thy gracious providence. Help them, then, to  partake of its fruits, to incline their ears to the rustling of its  leaves, and to the sweetness of the voice of the Bird that chanteth upon  its branches. Thou art, verily, the Help in Peril, the Inaccessible, the  Almighty, the Most Bountiful.    --Baha'u'llah        \"O Thou merciful God! O Thou Who art...\"      O Thou merciful God! O Thou Who art mighty and powerful! O Thou most kind  Father! These servants have gathered together, turning to Thee,  supplicating Thy threshold, desiring Thine endless bounties from Thy great  assurance. They have no purpose save Thy good pleasure. They have no  intention save service to the world of humanity.    O God! Make this assemblage radiant. Make the hearts merciful. Confer the  bounties of the Holy Spirit. Endow them with a power from heaven. Bless  them with heavenly minds. Increase their sincerity, so that with all  humility and contrition they may turn to Thy kingdom and be occupied with  service to the world of humanity. May each one become a radiant candle.  May each one become a brilliant star. May each one become beautiful in  color and redolent of fragrance in the kingdom of God.    O kind Father! Confer Thy blessings. Consider not our shortcomings.  Shelter us under Thy protection. Remember not our sins. Heal us with Thy  mercy. We are weak; Thou art mighty. We are poor; Thou art rich. We are  sick; Thou art the Physician. We are needy; Thou art most generous.    O God! Endow us with Thy providence. Thou art the Powerful. Thou art the  Giver. Thou art the Beneficent.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O Thou kind Lord! These are Thy servants...\"      O Thou kind Lord! These are Thy servants who have gathered in this  meeting, have turned unto Thy kingdom and are in need of Thy bestowal and  blessing. O Thou God! Manifest and make evident the signs of Thy oneness  which have been deposited in all the realities of life. Reveal and unfold  the virtues which Thou hast made latent and concealed in these human  realities.    O God! We are as plants, and Thy bounty is as the rain; refresh and cause  these plants to grow through Thy bestowal. We are Thy servants; free us  from the fetters of material existence. We are ignorant; make us wise. We  are dead; make us alive. We are material; endow us with spirit. We are  deprived; make us the intimates of Thy mysteries. We are needy; enrich and  bless us from Thy boundless treasury. O God! Resuscitate us; give us  sight; give us hearing; familiarize us with the mysteries of life, so that  the secrets of Thy kingdom may become revealed to us in this world of  existence and we may confess Thy oneness. Every bestowal emanates from  Thee; every benediction is Thine.    Thou art mighty. Thou art powerful. Thou art the Giver, and Thou art the  Ever-Bounteous.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O my God! O my God! Verily, these servants...\"      O my God! O my God! Verily, these servants are turning to Thee,  supplicating Thy kingdom of mercy. Verily, they are attracted by Thy  holiness and set aglow with the fire of Thy love, seeking confirmation  from Thy wondrous kingdom, and hoping for attainment in Thy heavenly  realm. Verily, they long for the descent of Thy bestowal, desiring  illumination from the Sun of Reality. O Lord! Make them radiant lamps,  merciful signs, fruitful trees and shining stars. May they come forth in  Thy service and be connected with Thee by the bonds and ties of Thy love,  longing for the lights of Thy favor. O Lord! Make them signs of guidance,  standards of Thine immortal kingdom, waves of the sea of Thy mercy,  mirrors of the light of Thy majesty.    Verily, Thou art the Generous. Verily, Thou art the Merciful. Verily, Thou  art the Precious, the Beloved.    --'Abdu'l-Baha        \"O Thou forgiving God! These servants are...\"      O Thou forgiving God! These servants are turning to Thy kingdom and  seeking Thy grace and bounty. O God! Make their hearts good and pure in  order that they may become worthy of Thy love. Purify and sanctify the  spirits that the light of the Sun of Reality may shine upon them. Purify  and sanctify the eyes that they may perceive Thy light. Purify and  sanctify the ears in order that they may hear the call of Thy kingdom.    O Lord! Verily, we are weak, but Thou art mighty. Verily, we are poor, but  Thou art rich. We are the seekers, and Thou art the One sought. O Lord!  Have compassion upon us and forgive us; bestow upon us such capacity and  receptiveness that we may be worthy of Thy favors and become attracted to  Thy kingdom, that we may drink deep of the water of life, may be enkindled  by the fire of Thy love, and be resuscitated through the breaths of the  Holy Spirit in this radiant century.

For example, a person being proficient in the  Japanese language may travel to Japan, or a person knowing the Chinese  language may hasten to China, and so forth.\"    No participator in this inter-American campaign of teaching must feel that  the initiative for any particular activity connected with this work must  rest solely with those agencies, whether Assemblies or committees, whose  special concern is to promote and facilitate the attainment of this vital  objective of the Seven Year Plan. It is the bounden duty of every American  believer, as the faithful trustee of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan, to  initiate, promote, and consolidate, within the limits fixed by the  administrative principles of the Faith, any activity he or she deems fit  to undertake for the furtherance of the Plan. Neither the threatening  world situation, nor any consideration of lack of material resources, of  mental equipment, of knowledge, or of experience--desirable as they  are--should deter any prospective pioneer teacher from arising  independently, and from setting in motion the forces which, 'Abdu'l-Baha  has repeatedly assured us, will, once released, attract even as a magnet  the promised and infallible aid of Baha'u'llah. Let him not wait for any  directions, or expect any special encouragement, from the elected  representatives of his community, nor be deterred by any obstacles which  his relatives, or fellow-citizens may be inclined to place in his path,  nor mind the censure of his critics or enemies. \"Be unrestrained as the  wind,\" is Baha'u'llah's counsel to every would-be teacher of His Cause,  \"while carrying the Message of Him Who hath caused the dawn of Divine  Guidance to break. Consider how the wind, faithful to that which God hath  ordained, bloweth upon all regions of the earth, be they inhabited or  desolate. Neither the sight of desolation, nor the evidences of  prosperity, can either pain or please it. It bloweth in every direction,  as bidden by its Creator.\" \"And when he determineth to leave his home, for  the sake of the Cause of his Lord,\" Baha'u'llah, in another passage,  referring to such a teacher, has revealed, \"let him put his whole trust in  God, as the best provision for his journey, and array himself with the  robe of virtue.... If he be kindled with the fire of His love, if he  forgoeth all created things, the words he uttereth shall set on fire them  that hear him.\"    Having on his own initiative, and undaunted by any hindrances with which  either friend or foe may, unwittingly or deliberately, obstruct his path,  resolved to arise and respond to the call of teaching, let him carefully  consider every avenue of approach which he might utilize in his personal  attempts to capture the attention, maintain the interest, and deepen the  faith, of those whom he seeks to bring into the fold of his Faith. Let him  survey the possibilities which the particular circumstances in which he  lives offer him, evaluate their advantages, and proceed intelligently and  systematically to utilize them for the achievement of the object he has in  mind. Let him also attempt to devise such methods as association with  clubs, exhibitions, and societies, lectures on subjects akin to the  teachings and ideals of his Cause such as temperance, morality, social  welfare, religious and racial tolerance, economic cooperation, Islam, and  Comparative Religion, or participation in social, cultural, humanitarian,  charitable, and educational organizations and enterprises which, while  safeguarding the integrity of his Faith, will open up to him a multitude  of ways and means whereby he can enlist successively the sympathy, the  support, and ultimately the allegiance of those with whom he comes in  contact. Let him, while such contacts are being made, bear in mind the  claims which his Faith is constantly making upon him to preserve its  dignity, and station, to safeguard the integrity of its laws and  principles, to demonstrate its comprehensiveness and universality, and to  defend fearlessly its manifold and vital interests. Let him consider the  degree of his hearer's receptivity, and decide for himself the suitability  of either the direct or indirect method of teaching, whereby he can  impress upon the seeker the vital importance of the Divine Message, and  persuade him to throw in his lot with those who have already embraced it.  Let him remember the example set by 'Abdu'l-Baha, and His constant  admonition to shower such kindness upon the seeker, and exemplify to such  a degree the spirit of the teachings he hopes to instill into him, that  the recipient will be spontaneously impelled to identify himself with the  Cause embodying such teachings. Let him refrain, at the outset, from  insisting on such laws and observances as might impose too severe a strain  on the seeker's newly awakened faith, and endeavor to nurse him,  patiently, tactfully, and yet determinedly, into full maturity, and aid  him to proclaim his unqualified acceptance of whatever has been ordained  by Baha'u'llah. Let him, as soon as that stage has been attained,  introduce him to the body of his fellow-believers, and seek, through  constant fellowship and active participation in the local activities of  his community, to enable him to contribute his share to the enrichment of  its life, the furtherance of its tasks, the consolidations of its  interests, and the coordination of its activities with those of its sister  communities. Let him not be content until he has infused into his  spiritual child so deep a longing as to impel him to arise independently,  in his turn, and devote his energies to the quickening of other souls, and  the upholding of the laws and principles laid down by his newly adopted  Faith.    Let every participator in the continent-wide campaign initiated by the  American believers, and particularly those engaged in pioneer work in  virgin territories, bear in mind the necessity of keeping in close and  constant touch with those responsible agencies designed to direct,  coordinate, and facilitate the teaching activities of the entire  community. Whether it be the body of their elected national  representatives, or its chief auxiliary institution, the National Teaching  Committee, or its subsidiary organs, the regional teaching committees, or  the local Spiritual Assemblies and their respective teaching committees,  they who labor for the spread of the Cause of Baha'u'llah should, through  constant interchange of ideas, through letters, circulars, reports,  bulletins and other means of communication with these established  instruments designed for the propagation of the Faith, insure the smooth  and speedy functioning of the teaching machinery of their Administrative  Order. Confusion, delay, duplication of efforts, dissipation of energy  will, thereby, be completely avoided, and the mighty flood of the grace of  Baha'u'llah, flowing abundantly and without the least obstruction through  these essential channels will so inundate the hearts and souls of men as  to enable them to bring forth the harvest repeatedly predicted by  'Abdu'l-Baha.    Upon every participator in this concerted effort, unprecedented in the  annals of the American Baha'i community, rests the spiritual obligation to  make of the mandate of teaching, so vitally binding upon all, the  all-pervading concern of his life. In his daily activities and contacts,  in all his journeys, whether for business or otherwise, on his holidays  and outings, and on any mission he may be called upon to undertake, every  bearer of the Message of Baha'u'llah should consider it not only an  obligation but a privilege to scatter far and wide the seeds of His Faith,  and to rest content in the abiding knowledge that whatever be the  immediate response to that Message, and however inadequate the vehicle  that conveyed it, the power of its Author will, as He sees fit, enable  those seeds to germinate, and in circumstances which no one can foresee  enrich the harvest which the labor of His followers will gather. If he be  member of any Spiritual Assembly let him encourage his Assembly to  consecrate a certain part of its time, at each of its sessions, to the  earnest and prayerful consideration of such ways and means as may foster  the campaign of teaching, or may furnish whatever resources are available  for its progress, extension, and consolidation. If he attends his summer  school--and everyone without exception is urged to take advantage of  attending it--let him consider such an occasion as a welcome and precious  opportunity so to enrich, through lectures, study, and discussion, his  knowledge of the fundamentals of his Faith as to be able to transmit, with  greater confidence and effectiveness, the Message that has been entrusted  to his care. Let him, moreover, seek, whenever feasible, through  intercommunity visits to stimulate the zeal for teaching, and to  demonstrate to outsiders the zest and alertness of the promoters of his  Cause and the organic unity of its institutions.    Let anyone who feels the urge among the participators in this crusade,  which embraces all the races, all the republics, classes and denominations  of the entire Western Hemisphere, arise, and, circumstances permitting,  direct in particular the attention, and win eventually the unqualified  adherence, of the Negro, the Indian, the Eskimo, and Jewish races to his  Faith. No more laudable and meritorious service can be rendered the Cause  of God, at the present hour, than a successful effort to enhance the  diversity of the members of the American Baha'i community by swelling the  ranks of the Faith through the enrollment of the members of these races.
