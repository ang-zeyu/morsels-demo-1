THE FORKED ROADS    _Omaha_      Long ago, in the days of the grandfathers, a man died and was buried  by his village. For four nights his ghost had to walk a very dark  trail. Then he reached the Milky Way and there was plenty of light.  For this reason, people ought to keep the funeral fires lighted for  four nights, so the spirit will not walk in the dark trail.    The spirit walked along the Milky Way. At last he came to a point  where the trail forked. There sat an old man. He was dressed in a  buffalo robe, with the hair on the outside. He pointed to each ghost  the road he was to take. One was short and led to the land of good  ghosts. The other was very long; along it the ghosts went wailing.    The spirits of suicides cannot travel either road. They must hover  over their graves. For them there is no future life.    A murderer is never happy after he dies. Ghosts surround him and keep  up a constant whistling. He is always hungry, though he eat much food.  He is never allowed to go where he pleases, lest high winds arise and  sweep down upon the others.          TATTOOED GHOSTS    _Dakota_      If a ghost wishes to walk the Ghost Road safely, then during living  the person must tattoo himself either in the forehead or on the  wrists. An old woman sits in the Ghost Road and she examines each  ghost who passes. If she finds the tattoo marks, then the ghost  travels on at once to Many Lodges. If the tattoo marks are not there,  the old woman pushes the ghost from a cloud and he falls to this world  again. Then he wanders all over the world. He is never quiet. He goes  about whistling, with no lodge, and people are afraid of him.    When these ghosts visit the sick, they are driven away by smoke from  the sacred cedar, or else cedar is laid outside the lodge. When a  person hears a ghost whistling he goes outside the lodge and makes a  loud noise. If a ghost calls to a loved one and he answers, then he is  sure to die soon.    If a ghost meets a man who is alone, he will catch hold of him and  pull his mouth and eyes until they are crooked. Indeed, a ghost did  this to a person who only dreamed about one.          A GHOST STORY    _Ponca_      A great many persons went on the warpath. They were Ponca. As they  approached the foe, they camped for the night. They kindled a fire. It  was during the night. After kindling a bright fire, they sat down;  they made the fire burn very brightly. Rejoicing greatly, they sat  eating. Very suddenly a person sang.    \"Keep quiet. Push the ashes over that fire. Seize your bow in  silence!\" said their leader. All took their bows. And they departed to  surround him. They made the circle smaller and smaller, and commenced  at once to come together. And still he stood singing; he did not stir  at all. At length they went very near to the tree. And when they drew  very near to it, the singer ceased his song. When they had reached the  tree, bones lay there in a pile. Human bones were piled there at the  foot of the tree. When persons die, the Dakotas usually suspend the  bodies in trees.          THE GHOST AND THE TRAVELER    _Teton_      Once an Indian alone was just at the edge of a forest. Then the  Thunder Beings raised a great storm. So he remained there for the  night. After it was dark, he noticed a light in the woods. When he  reached the spot, behold! there was a sweat lodge, in which were two  persons talking.    One said, \"Friend, someone has come and stands without. Let us invite  him to share our food.\"    Then the Indian fled because they were ghosts. But they followed him.  He looked back now and then, but he could not see them.    All at once he heard the cry of a woman. He was glad to have company.  But the moment he thought about the woman, she appeared. She said, \"I  have come because you have just wished to have company.\"    This frightened the man. The woman said, \"Do not fear me; else you  will never see me again.\"    They journeyed until daybreak. The man looked at her. She seemed to  have no legs, yet she walked without any effort. Then the man thought,  \"What if she should choke me.\" Immediately the ghost vanished.          THE MAN WHO SHOT A GHOST    _Teton_      In the olden time, a man was traveling alone, and in a forest he  killed several rabbits. After sunset he was in the midst of the  forest. He had to spend the night there, so he made a fire.    He thought this: \"Should I meet any danger by and by, I will shoot. I  am a man who ought not to regard anything.\"    He cooked a rabbit, so he was no longer hungry. Just then he heard  many voices. They were talking about their own affairs. But the man  could see no one.    So he thought: \"It seems now that at last I have encountered ghosts.\"    Then he went and lay under a fallen tree, which was a great distance  from the fire. They came around him and whistled, \"_Hyu! hyu! hyu!_\"    \"He has gone yonder,\" said one of the ghosts. Then they came and stood  around the man, just as people do when they hunt rabbits. The man lay  flat beneath the fallen tree, and one ghost came and climbed on the  trunk of that tree. Suddenly the ghost gave the cry that a man does  when he hits an enemy, \"_A-he!_\" Then the ghost kicked the man in the  back.    Before the ghost could get away, very suddenly the man shot at him and  wounded him in the legs. So the ghost cried as men do in pain, \"_Au!  au! au!_\" At last he went off, crying as women do, \"_Yun! yun! yun!  yun!_\"    The other ghosts said to him, \"Where did he shoot?\"    The wounded ghost said, \"He shot me through the head and I have come  apart.\" Then the other ghosts were wailing on the hillside.    The man decided he would go to the place where the ghosts were  wailing. So when day came, he went there. He found some graves. Into  one of them a wolf had dug, so that the bones could be seen; and there  was a wound in the skull.          [Illustration: BLACK COYOTE    Arapahoe chief, and a leader in the ghost-dance.    _Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution_]      [Illustration: ORNAMENTATION ON THE REVERSE OF AN ARAPAHOE  \"GHOST-DANCE\" SHIRT    _Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution_]          THE INDIAN WHO WRESTLED WITH A GHOST    _Teton_      A young man went alone on the warpath. At length he reached a wood.  One day, as he was going along, he heard a voice. He said, \"I shall  have company.\" As he was approaching a forest, he heard some one  halloo. Behold, it was an owl.    By and by he drew near another wood, and as night was coming on he lay  down to rest. At the edge of the trees he lay down in the open air. At  midnight he was aroused by the voice of a woman. She was wailing, \"My  son! my son!\" Still he remained where he was, and put more wood on the  fire. He lay with his back to the fire. He tore a hole in his blanket  large enough to peep through.    Soon he heard twigs break under the feet of one approaching, so he  looked through his blanket without rising. Behold, a woman of the  olden days was coming. She wore a skin dress with long fringe. A  buffalo robe was fastened around her at the waist. Her necklace was  of very large beads, and her leggings were covered with beads or  porcupine work. Her robe was drawn over her head and she was snuffing  as she came.    The man lay with his legs stretched out, and she stood by him. She  took him by one foot, which she raised very slowly. When she let it  go, it fell with a thud as though he were dead. She raised it a second  time; then a third time. Still the man did not move. Then the woman  pulled a very rusty knife from the front of her belt, seized his foot  suddenly and was about to lift it and cut it, when up sprang the man.  He said, \"What are you doing?\" Then he shot at her suddenly. She ran  into the forest screaming, \"_Yun! yun! yun! yun! yun! yun!_\" She  plunged into the forest and was seen no more.    Again the man covered his head with his blanket but he did not sleep.  When day came, he raised his eyes. Behold, there was a burial  scaffold, with the blankets all ragged and dangling. He thought, \"Was  this the ghost that came to me?\"    Again he came to a wood where he had to remain for the night. He  started a fire. As he sat there, suddenly he heard someone singing. He  made the woods ring. The man shouted to the singer, but no answer was  paid. The man had a small quantity of _wasna_, which was grease mixed  with pounded buffalo meat, and wild cherry; he also had plenty of  tobacco.    So when the singer came and asked him for food, the man said, \"I have  nothing.\" The ghost said, \"Not so; I know you have some _wasna_.\"    Then the man gave some of it to the ghost and filled his pipe. After  the meal, when the stranger took the pipe and held it by the stem, the  traveler saw that it was nothing but bones. There was no flesh. Then  the stranger's robe dropped back from his shoulders. Behold, all his  ribs were visible. There was no flesh on them. The ghost did not open  his lips when he smoked. The smoke came pouring out through his ribs.    When he had finished smoking, the ghost said, \"Ho! we must wrestle  together. If you can throw me, you shall kill the enemy without  hindrance and steal some horses.\"    The young man agreed. But first he threw an armful of brush on the  fire. He put plenty of brush near the fire.    Then the ghost rushed at the man. He seized him with his bony hands,  which was very painful; but this mattered not. The man tried to push  off the ghost, whose legs were very powerful. When the ghost was  pulled near the fire, he became weak; but when he pulled the young man  toward the darkness, he became strong. As the fire got low, the  strength of the ghost increased. Just as the man began to get weary,  the day broke. Then the struggle began again. As they drew near the  fire again, the man made a last effort; with his foot he pushed more  brush into the fire.

[Footnote 4: Scene in the nether world--purporting to be a  conversation between the departed ghost of a Southern slaveholding  clergyman, and the devil!]      [Music]    At dead of night, when others sleep,    Near Hell I took my station;  And from that dungeon, dark and deep,    O'erheard this conversation:  \"Hail, Prince of Darkness, ever hail,    Adored by each infernal,  I come among your gang to wail,    And taste of death eternal.\"    \"Where are you from?\" the fiend demands,    \"What makes you look so frantic?  Are you from Carolina's strand,    Just west of the Atlantic?  Are you that man of blood and birth,    Devoid of human feeling?  The wretch I saw, when last on earth,    In human cattle dealing?    \"Whose soul, with blood and rapine stain'd,    With deeds of crime to dark it;  Who drove God's image, starved and chained,    To sell like beasts in market?  Who tore the infant from the breast,    That you might sell its mother?  Whose craving mind could never rest,    Till you had sold a brother?    \"Who gave the sacrament to those    Whose chains and handcuffs rattle?  Whose backs soon after felt the blows,    More heavy than thy cattle?\"  \"I'm from the South,\" the ghost replies,    \"And I was there a teacher;  Saw men in chains, with laughing eyes:    I was a Southern Preacher!    \"In tassled pulpits, gay and fine,    I strove to please the tyrants,  To prove that slavery is divine,    And what the Scripture warrants.  And when I saw the horrid sight,    Of slaves by tortures dying,  And told their masters all was right,    I knew that I was lying.    \"I knew all this, and who can doubt,    I felt a sad misgiving?  But still, I knew, if I spoke out,    That I should lose my living.  They made me fat, they paid me well,    To preach down abolition,  I slept--I died--I woke in Hell,    How altered my condition!    \"I now am in a sea of fire,    Whose fury ever rages;  I am a slave, and can't get free,    Through everlasting ages.  Yes! when the sun and moon shall fade,    And fire the rocks dissever,  I must sink down beneath the shade,    And feel God's wrath for ever.\"    Our Ghost stood trembling all the while--    He saw the scene transpiring;  With soul aghast and visage sad,    All hope was now retiring.  The Demon cried, on vengeance bent,    \"I say, in haste, retire!  And you shall have a negro sent    To attend and punch the fire.\"          GET OFF THE TRACK.    Words by Jesse Hutchinson.

Clear the track of 'mancipation!    Let the ministers and churches  Leave behind sectarian lurches;  Jump on board the Car of Freedom,  Ere it be too late to need them.    Sound the alarm! Pulpits thunder!    Ere too late you see your blunder!    Politicians gazed, astounded,  When, at first, our bell resounded:  _Freight trains_ are coming, tell these foxes,  With our _votes_ and _ballot boxes_.    Jump for your lives! politicians,    From your dangerous, false positions.    Railroads to Emancipation  Cannot rest on _Clay_ foundation.  And the _tracks_ of '_The Polk-itian_'  Are but railroads to perdition!    Pull up the rails! Emancipation    Cannot rest on such foundation.

Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!

No doubt let now thy bosom mar:  Send up the shout--hurrah, hurrah!    Shall we distrust the God of Heaven?--    He every doubt and fear will quell;  By him the captive's chains are riven--    So let us loud the chorus swell!  Man shall be free from cruel law,--  Man shall be MAN!--hurrah, hurrah!

Hark! a voice from heaven proclaiming    Comfort to the mourning slave;  God has heard him long complaining,    And extends his arm to save;      Proud Oppression    Soon shall find a shameful grave.    See! the light of truth is breaking,    Full and clear on ev'ry hand;  And the voice of mercy, speaking,    Now is heard through all the land;      Firm and fearless,    See the friends of Freedom stand!    Lo! the nation is arousing    From its slumbers, long and deep;  And the church of God is waking,    Never, never more to sleep,      While a bondman,    In his chains remains to weep.

Then welcome to the battle's van--  We _hail_ thee as an HONEST MAN!    Thy own example leads the way    From Egypt's gloom to Canaan's light;  Thy justice is the breaking day    Of Slavery's long and guilty night;  Then welcome to the battle's van--  We hail thee as an honest man.    Thine is the eagle eye to see,    And thine a human heart to feel;  A worthy leader of the free,    We'll trust thee"]]]
