Ever since then I have had no patience with any school for my race in  the South which did not teach its students the dignity of labour.    During my last year at Hampton every minute of my time that was not  occupied with my duties as janitor was devoted to hard study. I was  determined, if possible, to make such a record in my class as would  cause me to be placed on the \"honour roll\" of Commencement speakers.  This I was successful in doing. It was June of 1875 when I finished the  regular course of study at Hampton. The greatest benefits that I got out  of my my life at the Hampton Institute, perhaps, may be classified under  two heads:--    First was contact with a great man, General S.C. Armstrong, who, I  repeat, was, in my opinion, the rarest, strongest, and most beautiful  character that it has ever been my privilege to meet.    Second, at Hampton, for the first time, I learned what education was  expected to do for an individual. Before going there I had a good deal  of the then rather prevalent idea among our people that to secure an  education meant to have a good, easy time, free from all necessity for  manual labour. At Hampton I not only learned that it was not a disgrace  to labour, but learned to love labour, not alone for its financial  value, but for labour's own sake and for the independence and  self-reliance which the ability to do something which the world wants  done brings. At that institution I got my first taste of what it meant  to live a life of unselfishness, my first knowledge of the fact that the  happiest individuals are those who do the most to make others useful and  happy.    I was completely out of money when I graduated. In company with other  Hampton students, I secured a place as a table waiter in a summer hotel  in Connecticut, and managed to borrow enough money with which to get  there. I had not been in this hotel long before I found out that I knew  practically nothing about waiting on a hotel table. The head waiter,  however, supposed that I was an accomplished waiter. He soon gave me  charge of the table at which there sat four or five wealthy and rather  aristocratic people. My ignorance of how to wait upon them was so  apparent that they scolded me in such a severe manner that I became  frightened and left their table, leaving them sitting there without  food. As a result of this I was reduced from the position of waiter to  that of a dish-carrier.    But I determined to learn the business of waiting, and did so within  a few weeks and was restored to my former position. I have had the  satisfaction of being a guest in this hotel several times since I was a  waiter there.    At the close of the hotel season I returned to my former home in Malden,  and was elected to teach the coloured school at that place. This was the  beginning of one of the happiest periods of my life. I now felt that I  had the opportunity to help the people of my home town to a higher life.  I felt from the first that mere book education was not all that the  young people of that town needed. I began my work at eight o'clock in  the morning, and, as a rule, it did not end until ten o'clock at night.  In addition to the usual routine of teaching, I taught the pupils to  comb their hair, and to keep their hands and faces clean, as well as  their clothing. I gave special attention to teaching them the proper  use of the tooth-brush and the bath. In all my teaching I have watched  carefully the influence of the tooth-brush, and I am convinced  that there are few single agencies of civilization that are more  far-reaching.    There were so many of the older boys and girls in the town, as well as  men and women, who had to work in the daytime and still were craving an  opportunity for an education, that I soon opened a night-school. From  the first, this was crowded every night, being about as large as the  school that I taught in the day. The efforts of some of the men and  women, who in many cases were over fifty years of age, to learn, were in  some cases very pathetic.    My day and night school work was not all that I undertook. I established  a small reading-room and a debating society. On Sundays I taught two  Sunday-schools, one in the town of Malden in the afternoon, and the  other in the morning at a place three miles distant from Malden. In  addition to this, I gave private lessons to several young men whom I was  fitting to send to the Hampton Institute. Without regard to pay and with  little thought of it, I taught any one who wanted to learn anything that  I could teach him. I was supremely happy in the opportunity of being  able to assist somebody else. I did receive, however, a small salary  from the public fund, for my work as a public-school teacher.    During the time that I was a student at Hampton my older brother, John,  not only assisted me all that he could, but worked all of the time in  the coal-mines in order to support the family. He willingly neglected  his own education that he might help me. It was my earnest wish to help  him to prepare to enter Hampton, and to save money to assist him in his  expenses there. Both of these objects I was successful in accomplishing.  In three years my brother finished the course at Hampton, and he is  now holding the important position of Superintendent of Industries at  Tuskegee. When he returned from Hampton, we both combined our efforts  and savings to send our adopted brother, James, through the Hampton  Institute. This we succeeded in doing, and he is now the postmaster  at the Tuskegee Institute. The year 1877, which was my second year of  teaching in Malden, I spent very much as I did the first.    It was while my home was at Malden that what was known as the \"Ku Klux  Klan\" was in the height of its activity. The \"Ku Klux\" were bands of  men who had joined themselves together for the purpose of regulating the  conduct of the coloured people, especially with the object of preventing  the members of the race from exercising any influence in politics. They  corresponded somewhat to the \"patrollers\" of whom I used to hear a  great deal during the days of slavery, when I was a small boy. The  \"patrollers\" were bands of white men--usually young men--who were  organized largely for the purpose of regulating the conduct of the  slaves at night in such matters as preventing the slaves from going from  one plantation to another without passes, and for preventing them from  holding any kind of meetings without permission and without the presence  at these meetings of at least one white man.    Like the \"patrollers\" the \"Ku Klux\" operated almost wholly at night.  They were, however, more cruel than the \"patrollers.\" Their objects, in  the main, were to crush out the political aspirations of the Negroes,  but they did not confine themselves to this, because schoolhouses as  well as churches were burned by them, and many innocent persons were  made to suffer. During this period not a few coloured people lost their  lives.    As a young man, the acts of these lawless bands made a great impression  upon me. I saw one open battle take place at Malden between some of the  coloured and white people. There must have been not far from a hundred  persons engaged on each side; many on both sides were seriously injured,  among them General Lewis Ruffner, the husband of my friend Mrs. Viola  Ruffner. General Ruffner tried to defend the coloured people, and  for this he was knocked down and so seriously wounded that he never  completely recovered. It seemed to me as I watched this struggle between  members of the two races, that there was no hope for our people in this  country. The \"Ku Klux\" period was, I think, the darkest part of the  Reconstruction days.    I have referred to this unpleasant part of the history of the South  simply for the purpose of calling attention to the great change that has  taken place since the days of the \"Ku Klux.\" To-day there are no such  organizations in the South, and the fact that such ever existed is  almost forgotten by both races. There are few places in the South now  where public sentiment would permit such organizations to exist.        Chapter V. The Reconstruction Period    The years from 1867 to 1878 I think may be called the period of  Reconstruction. This included the time that I spent as a student at  Hampton and as a teacher in West Virginia. During the whole of the  Reconstruction period two ideas were constantly agitating in the minds  of the coloured people, or, at least, in the minds of a large part of  the race. One of these was the craze for Greek and Latin learning, and  the other was a desire to hold office.    It could not have been expected that a people who had spent generations  in slavery, and before that generations in the darkest heathenism, could  at first form any proper conception of what an education meant. In every  part of the South, during the Reconstruction period, schools, both  day and night, were filled to overflowing with people of all ages and  conditions, some being as far along in age as sixty and seventy  years. The ambition to secure an education was most praiseworthy and  encouraging. The idea, however, was too prevalent that, as soon as one  secured a little education, in some unexplainable way he would be free  from most of the hardships of the world, and, at any rate, could live  without manual labour. There was a further feeling that a knowledge,  however little, of the Greek and Latin languages would make one a very  superior human being, something bordering almost on the supernatural. I  remember that the first coloured man whom I saw who knew something about  foreign languages impressed me at the time as being a man of all others  to be envied.    Naturally, most of our people who received some little education became  teachers or preachers. While among those two classes there were many  capable, earnest, godly men and women, still a large proportion took"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23800"],[0,"Contemporary American Composers (#12)"],[1," in  instrumentation;        (_b_) \"And I, too, was born in Arcadia,\"    which is a pastorale with delicious touches of extreme delicacy;        (_c_) \"In Darkest Africa,\"    which has a stunning beginning and is a stirring grotesque in the  negro manner Dvorak advised Americans to cultivate. All three are well  arranged for the piano.    The second suite is based on \"The Last Days of Pompeii.\" It opens with  a drunken revel, \"In the House of Burbo and Stratonice;\" the bulky  brutishness of the gladiators clamoring for wine, a jolly  drinking-song, and a dance by a jingling clown make up a superbly  written number. The second movement is named \"Nydia,\" and represents  the pathetic reveries of the blind girl; it is tender and quiet  throughout.    The third movement is at once daring and masterly. It boldly attacks  \"The Destruction,\" and attains real heights of graphic suggestion. A  long, almost inaudible roll on the drums, with occasional thuds,  heralds the coming of the earthquake; subterranean rumblings, sharp  rushes of tremor, toppling stones, and wild panic are insinuated  vividly, with no cheap attempts at actual imitation. The roaring of  the terrified lion is heard, and, best touch of all, under the fury of  the scene persists the calm chant of the Nazarenes, written in one of  the ancient modes. The rout gives way to the sea-voyage of Glaucus and  Ione, and Nydia's swan-song dies away in the gentle splash of ripples.  The work is altogether one of superb imagination and scholarly  achievement.    Sousa, appealing as he does to an audience chiefly of the popular  sort, makes frequent use of devices shocking to the conventional. But  even in this he is impelled by the enthusiasm of an experimenter and a  developer. Almost every unconventional novelty is hooted at in the  arts. But the sensationalism of to-day is the conservatism of  to-morrow, and the chief difference between a touch of high art and a  trick is that the former succeeds and the latter does not. Both are  likely to have a common origin.    The good thing is that Sousa is actuated by the spirit of progress and  experiment, and has carried on the development of the military band  begun by the late Patrick S. Gilmore. Sousa's concert programs devote  what is in fact the greater part of their space to music by the very  best composers. These, of course, lose something in being translated  over to the military band, but their effect in raising the popular  standard of musical culture cannot but be immense. Through such  instrumentality much of Wagner is as truly popular as any music  played. The active agents of such a result should receive the  heartiest support from every one sincerely interested in turning the  people toward the best things in music. Incidentally, it is well to  admit that while a cheap march-tune is almost as trashy as an  uninspired symphony, a good march-tune is one of the best things in  the best music.    Though chiefly known as a writer of marches, in which he has won glory  enough for the average human ambition, Sousa has also taken a large  place in American comic opera. His first piece, \"The Smugglers,\" was  produced in 1879, and scored the usual failure of a first work. His  \"Katherine\" was never produced, his \"Desiree\" was brought out in 1884  by the McCaull Opera Company, and his \"Queen of Hearts,\" a one-act  piece, was given two years later. He forsook opera then for ten years;  but in 1896 De Wolf Hopper produced his \"El Capitan\" with great  success.    The chief tune of the piece was a march used with Meyerbeerian  effectiveness to bring down the curtain. The stout verve of this \"El  Capitan\" march gave it a large vogue outside the opera. Hopper next  produced \"The Charlatan,\" a work bordering upon opera comique in its  first version. Both of these works scored even larger success in  London than at home.    [Music: Used by permission of the John Church Company, owners of the  copyright.    A PAGE FROM \"EL CAPITAN,\" BY JOHN PHILIP SOUSA.]    In \"The Bride Elect,\" Sousa wrote his own libretto, and while there  was the usual stirring march as the piece de resistance, the work as a  whole was less clangorous of the cymbal than the operas of many a  tamer composer. In \"Chris and the Wonderful Lamp,\" an extravaganza,  the chief ensemble was worked up from a previous march, \"Hands Across  the Sea.\"    But Sousa can write other things than marches, and his scoring is full  of variety, freedom, and contrapuntal brilliance.      _Henry Schoenefeld._    [Illustration: HENRY SCHOENEFELD.]    Long before Dvorak discovered America, we aboriginals had been trying  to invent a national musical dialect which should identify us as  completely to the foreigner as our nasal intonation and our fondness  for the correct and venerable use of the word \"guess.\" But Dvorak is  to credit for taking the problem off the shelf, and persuading our  composers to think. I cannot coax myself into the enthusiasm some have  felt for Dvorak's own explorations in darkest Africa. His quartette  (op. 96) and his \"New World\" symphony are about as full of accent and  infidelity as Mlle. Yvette Guilbert's picturesque efforts to sing in  English. But almost anything is better than the phlegm that says, \"The  old ways are good enough for all time;\" and the Bohemian missionary  must always hold a place in the chronicle of American music.    A disciple of Dvorak's, both in advance and in retrospect, is Henry  Schoenefeld, who wrote a characteristic suite (op. 15) before the  Dvorakian invasion, and an overture, \"In the Sunny South,\" afterward.  The suite, which has been played frequently abroad, winning the  praises of Hanslick, Nicode, and Rubinstein, is scored for string  orchestra. It opens with an overly reminiscent waltz-tune, and ends  conventionally, but it contains a movement in negro-tone that gives it  importance. In this the strings are abetted by a tambourine, a  triangle, and a gong. It is in march-time, and, after a staccato  prelude, begins with a catchy air taken by the second violins, while  the firsts, divided, fill up the chords. A slower theme follows in the  tonic major; it is a jollificational air, dancing from the first  violins with a bright use of harmonics. Two periods of loud chorale  appear with the gong clanging (to hint a church-bell, perhaps). The  first two themes return and end the picture.    The overture (op. 22) has won the high esteem of A.J. Goodrich, and  it seems to me to be one of the most important of native works, not  because of its nigrescence, but because of its spontaneity therein. It  adds to the usual instruments only the piccolo, the English horn, the  tambourine, and triangle and cymbals. The slow introduction gives  forth an original theme in the most approved and most fetching darky  pattern. The strings announce it, and the wood replies. The flutes and  clarinets toss it in a blanket furnished by an interesting passage in  the 'cellos and contrabasses. There is a choral moment from the English  horn, the bassoons, and a clarinet. This solemn thought keeps  recurring parenthetically through the general gaiety. The first  subject clatters in, the second is even more jubilant. In the  development a dance _misterioso_ is used with faithful screaming  repetitions, and the work ends regularly and brilliantly. There is  much syncopation, though nothing that is strictly in \"rag-time;\"  banjo-figurations are freely and ingeniously employed, and the whole  is a splendid fiction in local color. Schoenefeld's negroes do not  speak Bohemian.    His determined nationalism is responsible for his festival overture,  \"The American Flag,\" based on his own setting of Rodman Drake's  familiar poem. The work opens with the hymn blaring loudly from the  antiphonal brass and wood. The subjects are taken from it with much  thematic skill, and handled artfully, but the hymn, which appears in  full force for coda, is as trite as the most of its kith.    Schoenefeld was born in Milwaukee, in 1857. His father was a musician,  and his teacher for some years. At the age of seventeen Schoenefeld  went to Leipzig, where he spent three years, studying under Reinecke,  Coccius, Papperitz, and Grill. A large choral and orchestral work was  awarded a prize over many competitors, and performed at the Gewandhaus  concerts, the composer conducting. Thereafter he went to Weimar, where  he studied under Edward Lassen.    In 1879 he came back to America, and took up his residence in Chicago,  where he has since lived as a teacher, orchestra leader, and composer.  He has for many years directed the Germania Maennerchor.    Schoenefeld's \"Rural Symphony\" was awarded the $500 prize offered by  the National Conservatory. Dvorak was the chairman of the Committee on  Award, and gave Schoenefeld hearty compliments. Later works are: \"Die  drei Indianer,\" an ode for male chorus, solo, and orchestra; a most  beautiful \"Air\" for orchestra (the air being taken by most of the  strings,--the first violins haunting the G string,--while a harp and  three flutes carry the burden of the accompaniment gracefully); a  pleasant \"Reverie\" for string orchestra, harp, and organ; and two  impromptus for string orchestra, a \"Meditation\" representing Cordelia  brooding tenderly over the slumbering King Lear,--art ministering very  tenderly to the mood,--and a cleverly woven \"Valse Noble.\"    Only a few of Schoenefeld's works are published, all of them piano  pieces. It is no slur upon his orchestral glory to say that these are  for the most part unimportant, except the excellent \"Impromptu\" and  \"Prelude.\" Of the eight numbers in \"The Festival,\" for children, only  the \"Mazurka\" is likely to make even the smallest child think. The  \"Kleine Tanz Suite\" is better. The six children's pieces of opus 41,  \"Mysteries of the Wood,\" make considerable appeal to the fancy and  imagination, and are highly interesting. They show Grieg's influence  very plainly, and are quite"]]]
