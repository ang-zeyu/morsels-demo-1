You'll never manage it if you  don't.\"    \"Not at all a bad idea,\" said one or two.  \"You be the captain,  Hawkesbury.\"    \"No, thank you,\" said he, smiling gratefully.  \"I really am not used to  this sort of thing; but I think Smith, now, would be just the fellow.\"    I considered this beautiful of Hawkesbury, coming so soon after Smith's  rather uncomplimentary behaviour to him.    The proposition was generally approved.  Smith was not a favourite, but  he had made the only suggestions of any real use in the present case,  and appeared to have entered into the scheme so warmly that it was  evident no one would make a better captain.    He received his new dignity with great complacency.    \"I'll do my best,\" said he, \"if you fellows will back me up and stick to  the engagement.\"    Our time was now getting brief, so after a few more hurried suggestions  and discussions we separated and returned to our ordinary duties.    That evening the Henniker was no better than she had been during the  day.  Her brief sojourn in society that afternoon had not improved her a  bit, Flanagan, as usual, suggested a plausible reason.    \"I expect,\" whispered he, \"she went after a new pupil and didn't hook  him; that's why she's in such a precious tantrum.\"    \"Flanagan!\" cried the well-known voice--\"Flanagan, come here!\"    Flanagan obeyed, and stood meekly before the tyrant.    \"This is the eighth time to-day, Flanagan, I have rebuked you for  talking.  You are detained for the rest of the term.  Hold out your  hand, Flanagan!\"    It was not often the Henniker inflicted corporal punishment herself;  when she did it was pretty smart, as Flanagan found.  In the absence of  a cane she had used the ruler, and as Flanagan--who unsuspectingly  supposed she was merely seized with a desire to inspect his nails--held  out his hand knuckles upwards, the ruler descended on his knuckles with  such force that the luckless youth howled for astonishment, and  performed a dance _solo_ in the middle of the floor.    We were sorry for him, yet we inwardly smiled to think how soon the  tables would be turned.    That night, just before we went to bed, as I was in the shoe-room  looking for my slippers, I had the satisfaction of hearing the Henniker  say to the kitchen-maid, \"Matilda, we're getting short of bread.  Let  the baker know to call on Monday next week.\"    Things could not have promised better for our desperate scheme!        CHAPTER SEVEN.    HOW THERE AROSE A NOTABLE REBELLION AT STONEBRIDGE HOUSE.    Of course we were wrong; of course we were foolish.    But then, reader, please remember we were only boys goaded up to the  last pitch, and quite unable, as I have narrated, to stand the Henniker  any longer.    It was no game we were embarked on.  If you had seen the seriousness of  our faces as we inspected the parlour and reconnoitred the Henniker's  future prison, that Saturday; if you had heard the seriousness of our  voices as we solemnly deliberated whether nails or screws would be best  to use in fastening up the doors--you would have found out that,  \"backward and troublesome\" boys as we were, we could be in earnest  sometimes.    \"Screwing's quieter,\" said Rathbone.    \"Nailing's quicker,\" said Philpot.    \"Isn't that a thing the captain had better decide?\" softly suggested  Hawkesbury, turning to Smith.    I always got fidgety when the senior boy and my chum got near each  other.  Smith had such a way of firing up instinctively at whatever the  other might say, even when it meant no harm.    He flared up now with his eyes, and then turning to the two boys, said,  shortly, \"Screws of course; that's been settled long ago.\"    Hawkesbury smiled gratefully, and said he was sure a matter like that  would not be overlooked.    Well, the Henniker went on having her fling that Saturday and Sunday.  We caught it right and left, and took it all meekly.  Nay, some of us  took it so meekly that I was once or twice afraid our secret would be  suspected.    The regulation-reading in the parlour on Sunday evening was a shocking  time for me.  I had no intention of being bad, but somehow, what with  the excitement of our scheme, and the dreariness of the reader's voice,  and the closeness of the room, I fell asleep and nearly rolled off my  form.    The Henniker put down her book.    \"Batchelor,\" said she, \"you shall be punished.  Stand on the form and  read aloud.\"    And so saying, she handed me the book and pointed to the place.    This was the very refinement of torture, and I draw a veil over the sad  spectacle which followed.  Nor was I the only victim standing there  struggling and perspiring through the long sentences, turned back  whenever I made a mistake, to begin the page over again, till the end of  the chapter seemed to get farther and farther away; the other boys, too,  came in for part of the tragedy, for the Henniker, being now free of her  book, had no occupation for her eyes but to glare at them, and no  occupation for her tongue but to level bad marks and rebukes and  punishments at the head of every offender.    \"Reading\" lasted that evening until ten o'clock, and to this day I  cannot imagine how it ever came to an end even then.  I know I never got  to the end.  This sad experience gave a considerable additional zest to  our hopes of freedom on the following day.    Smith was not the sort of fellow to undertake what he did not mean to  carry through, and I was astonished to see how carefully his plans were  laid, and how precisely he had allotted to every one of us our  respective duties.    Monday dawned at length, and we rose from our beds like patriots on the  morning of a battle which is to decide their freedom or slavery.    I had two minutes' whisper with Smith as we went down to breakfast.    \"Tell the fellows,\" said he, \"that the signal to begin will be just when  morning school is over.  The Hen goes to get ready for dinner, and  Shankley and Philpot are to follow and screw her up.  The holes are  already bored, so it won't take long.\"    \"Suppose she yells,\" suggested I.    \"Not likely, but if she does--her room's far enough away.  Oh! by the  way, I've screwed her window already.  I thought we can one of us easily  smash a pane for her if she wants more ventilation.\"    \"And how about Ladislaw and Hashford?\"    \"I'm going down, when the Henniker's safe, to ask them both to step up  into the parlour.  They'll probably think something's wrong, and hurry  up.  (I've screwed that window, too, by the way.)  Then you and Rathbone  are to screw their door when they are safe in--I've put the key outside,  too--and I've told the other fellows to be ready to bring a lot of desks  and things out of the schoolroom and pile them up, in case they kick too  hard.\"    \"Upon my word, Jack, you're a regular general.  But I say, we've  forgotten the two servants.\"    \"No, we haven't.  I've told them what's up, and they won't interfere;  but--shut up now.\"    During the morning we continued to pass round word what the arrangements  were, and waited feverishly for the close of morning school.  As we sat  in the class-room we had the satisfaction of seeing first the butcher's  pony and then the baker's cart drive up the front garden and drive back  again.  We were all right for the \"sinews of war\" for a day or two,  anyhow!    The Henniker kept it up till the last, and distributed her favours  lavishly and impartially all round.  But we heeded it not; we even  enjoyed it, for were not we to have our innings next?    It seemed as if morning school would never end.  At last a fluttering at  our hearts, more convincing even than the clock, told us the hour was  come.  We rose from our seats.  The rebellion at Stonebridge House had  begun.    The Henniker marched with stately tread from the room, and up the stairs  to her own apartment.  It seemed a long journey to us, who sat listening  in breathless silence, and at last the closing of her door seemed to  resound all over the house.    \"Now then,\" said Smith to Shankley and Philpot, who, with their shoes  off and their tools in their hands, stood ready, like two trained  assassins, for the word of command.  \"Now then, and keep quiet, whatever  you do!\"    They went.  There was nothing stately about their march.  They darted up  the stairs two steps at a time, and the last we saw of them was as they  turned the corner into the passage, at the end of which was situate the  enemy's fortress.    It seemed a year before they returned!    At last Shankley, with beaming face, burst into our midst.    \"It's all right!\" said he, in an excited whisper.  \"She sounded a little  like kicking, so Philpot's keeping guard.  We had one screw half in  before she even heard us.\"    \"What did she say then?\" asked three or four eager questioners.    \"She wanted to know who was there, and if we wanted to speak to her we  must wait till she came down, and a bad mark to whoever it was for  coming and disturbing her.\"    There was a general laugh at this, which Smith hurriedly checked.    \"The thing's only half done yet,\" he said.  \"Time enough to laugh when  the other two are safe.\"    This was a wise rebuke, and we became serious in an instant.    \"Now,\" said Smith, \"have you got the screwdriver and screws all right,  Batchelor?  The rest of you be ready if I call;\" and off he went to  summon the two masters to the parlour.    It was a critical moment, for every thing depended on our getting both  into the room together.    Smith, so he told us afterwards, found both Mr Ladislaw and Mr  Hashford talking together in the study of the former.  He entered the  room suddenly, and crying, in an agitated voice, \"O"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21059"],[0,"The Adventures of Dick Maitland: A Tale of Unknown Africa (#12)"],[1,"in his younger days, was an experienced hunter, knew the  interior, its inhabitants, and their peculiarities as well as, if not  better than, any other man living, and was brimful of information and  hints absolutely invaluable to the new arrivals, which he freely  imparted.  When told of the nature and scope of the young men's  projected adventure, however, he shook his head dubiously, and strongly  urged them to abandon the idea of attempting more than just a few  months' big-game shooting.    \"Mind you,\" he said, \"I strongly sympathise with you in your very  ambitious aims, ridiculous as many men would pronounce them, for I was  animated by precisely the same desire myself when I was a youngster of  about your age,\" turning to Grosvenor.    \"By Jove! you don't say so?\" ejaculated Grosvenor, surprised and  delighted to meet a man of such wide experience as Mitchell who did not  pronounce his plans chimerical; for it must be stated that thus far the  enunciation of those plans had been almost invariably received with  either covert or open ridicule.  \"Then,\" he continued, \"do I understand  that you believe in the possibility of finding the site of ancient  Ophir?\"    \"Well--yes--you may understand me to mean that--in a general way,\" was  Mitchell's somewhat guarded admission.  \"But,\" he continued, \"if you ask  whether I think it probable that you will discover either Ophir or the  mysterious white race which rumour has asserted to exist somewhere in  the far interior, I answer: Certainly not.\"    \"The dickens!\" exclaimed Grosvenor.  \"But why, my dear sir, why?\"    \"Well--if you will not be offended by my exceeding candour--chiefly  because I think you both much too young and too inexperienced to have  any chance of succeeding in so very formidable an undertaking,\" was the  somewhat discouraging reply.    \"Yes, of course,\" admitted Grosvenor, \"it is true that we are both quite  inexperienced; but our youth is surely in our favour rather than against  us, for we are strong and healthy, and no doubt will soon become inured  to fatigue, hardship, and even privation.  We both have splendid  constitutions; and, moreover, my friend Maitland here is a doctor and  surgeon of quite remarkable ability, which fact I regard as of the  utmost importance.  Then, as to the matter of experience, I imagine that  we are bound to acquire that as we go on; we are not going to be  transported into the heart of the wilds in a few hours by express train,  you know.\"    \"No,\" answered Mitchell, with a somewhat grim smile, \"that is quite  true, as is also your contention that you will acquire some experience  as you go on.  Then, of course, the fact that Mr Maitland is a doctor  and surgeon--of which I was unaware--is a great point in your favour.  But, when all is said, I still think that you will find the undertaking  too much for you.  Why-- By the way, did you ever hear of a certain  Charles Menzies?\"    \"The explorer, you mean?  Yes, I have heard of him; in fact I believe it  was an account of his travels that first put this idea into my head,\"  answered Grosvenor.    \"Ah!\" remarked Mitchell cryptically; \"I wonder just how much you have  heard respecting his travels?\"    \"Well, not very much, I must confess,\" acknowledged Grosvenor.  \"So far  as I can remember, it amounted simply to the statement that after one of  his long absences from civilisation he returned with the story that he  had actually discovered the site of ancient Ophir; and that he had  gathered reliable information concerning the existence of the mysterious  white race, which is to be one of the objects of my quest.\"    \"Just so,\" commented Mitchell, relapsing into a pregnant silence.  It  was evident that he was intently considering some difficult question.  Presently he looked up and said:    \"I knew Menzies very well in my younger days.  As a matter of fact I  saved his life; for had I not happened to have fallen in with him and  picked him up he must have inevitably perished; and in that case the  public would never have heard any of the extraordinary rumours  respecting his discoveries that afterwards leaked out.  I was away up-  country elephant hunting at the time, and I found him, some seventy  miles this side of the Zambezi, in the last stages of exhaustion from  starvation.  He was then returning from the journey that made him  famous, and had lost everything he possessed, even to his rifle; it is  therefore nothing short of marvellous that he had contrived to make his  way as far back as he did when I found him.  He was too ill to talk much  when I first picked him up, but afterwards, when he grew stronger, he  told me the whole astounding story of his journey and his adventures.  He talked of publishing the narrative, but I very strongly dissuaded him  from doing so; for, as I pointed out to him, there were portions of that  narrative which were of so absolutely incredible a character that nobody  would believe them, and the story would lose all value from the fact  that it would be regarded as merely a fantastic fabrication, and he  would gain the reputation of an unblushing romancer.  To tell you the  truth, I was firmly persuaded at the time that what he had gone through  had affected his brain, and that he was the victim of a series of the  most weird and horrible illusions.  But I had reason to modify my  opinion in that respect a few years afterward, although I am still  unable to make up my mind definitely as to just how much of his story  was true and how much was due to an imagination that had become warped  and distorted by peril and suffering.\"    \"By Jove!\" exclaimed Grosvenor, with a sort of thrill in his voice.  \"I  say, you know, all this is intensely interesting.  Eh, what?  I wonder  if you would mind repeating to us a few of those statements that you  found it so difficult to believe at the time, and with regard to which  you were afterwards inclined to modify your opinion?\"    \"Well,\" answered Mitchell, \"I am afraid I must ask you to excuse me from  doing that.  You see, Menzies was my friend, and one of the finest  fellows that ever lived.  He is dead now, poor chap, and I would not  willingly say a single word that might cause you or anyone else to think  lightly of him, or picture him in your mind as other than the very soul  of truth and honour.  Yet if I were to repeat to you some of the  statements that I have in my mind, I know that you two hard-headed,  matter-of-fact Englishmen would at once set them down as the veriest  fairy tales, their author a second Munchausen, and myself a credulous  old fool for attaching the slightest weight to them.  And yet, let me  tell you, Africa is a very queer country--as you will discover if you  persist in attempting to carry out your plan--and queer things happen in  it, things that strain a man's credulity to the breaking-point, until he  has had personal experience of them.  That remark of Shakespeare's, that  `there are more things in heaven and earth than are reckoned in our  philosophy' is nowhere more forcefully confirmed than in this continent  of Africa, and especially in those parts of it which are practically  unknown to the white man.  Why, even here, close at hand, among our  neighbours the Zulus, there have been happenings--well authenticated,  mind you--that are absolutely unexplainable by any knowledge that we  whites possess.  But I think I have prosed enough for one sitting, and  it is growing late--one o'clock, as I am a living sinner!--and you must  be growing tired.  Do you wonder why I have told you all these things?  Well, it is because I should like to dissuade you from this mad scheme  of yours, which my experience tells me can only end in disaster, and  induce you to content yourselves with a two-months' hunting trip in the  company of some good man who knows the country, and can be trusted to  see that you come to no harm.  Now, good night, both of you! think over  what I have said; sleep well, and don't dream of fantastic horrors such  as my talk may have suggested.\"    If Mr Joseph Mitchell, sugar planter, and thoroughly honest, well-  meaning man, flattered himself that the foregoing conversation would  have any other effect than to stimulate the curiosity of his guests and  confirm them in their determination to carry out their plans in their  entirety, he very greatly over-estimated his persuasive powers, and  completely misread the characters of those to whom he had been talking.  For both Grosvenor and Maitland were of a highly adventurous  disposition, and what Mitchell had told them had simply whetted their  curiosity to a keen edge, and had strongly suggested to them that the  adventure promised to be of an even more alluring and thrilling  character than they had ever ventured to hope, even in their most  sanguine moments.  So much, indeed, they made clear to their host when  they met him the next morning at the breakfast table; and, when he would  have made a further attempt at dissuasion, laughingly assured him that  their minds were finally made up, and that the kindest thing he could  now do for them would be to give them as much information and as many  hints and wrinkles as he could think of to help them to a satisfactory  conclusion of the adventure.  This Mitchell proceeded to do, when at  length the conviction had been borne in upon him that all his efforts at  dissuasion were worse than useless; and when, two days later, they took  leave of the genial planter, Dick carried away with him a notebook  crowded from cover to cover with information that was destined to prove  of incalculable value to him and his companion, as well as a sketch map  showing the best route to follow, and certain localities that were to be  most carefully avoided if they desired to return sane and sound to  civilisation.    Arrived in Durban once more, after a most delightful jaunt, they at once  set about making their preparations in earnest, one of the first"]]]
