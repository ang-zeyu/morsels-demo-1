Soon some robbers rude appeared,    Who stopped this mule upon his road,  And very soon they had him cleared    Of all his weight of precious gold.  Falling beneath their blows, \"I die,\"    The expiring trotter cried,  \"Had you been,\" said the other,    \"Low as I, you would not thus have died.\"    Be moderate when you are high,  Nor glory o'er the passers by.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    JUPITER AND THE FARMER.      Jupiter had a farm to let,  Mercury advertised it, and people came,  Made offers, listened, all the same,  Made some objection.  One declared the land  Was rough and dry,  And full of sand.  One had this reason, one had that,  Until at last a man appeared,  Who said he'd try to farm it, agreed that  He might have any weather that he chose.    Behold! as soon as he but yawns, it blows  Or rains, or is quite clear.  His neighbors, even the most near,  Are not affected by these changes.  In usual route, their weather ranges;  They have good crops,  But he had none.  At last when tired, he began  Complaining unto Jupiter.  The next year the same thing,  Changes of weather he can bring--  And the neighbors no more  Than the Americans,  Are troubled by the farming  Of his lands.  At last tired out, with all his strife in vain,  He yields his power to the God of rain;  Acknowledging, that all along  The god did right,  And he did wrong.      MORAL.    Let us conclude that Providence  For man ordains much better than we can.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE COCK, THE CAT, AND THE  LITTLE MOUSE.      A young mouse, who had nothing seen,  Was nearly caught; You shall hear how  He told his mother the adventure--  He said, \"Pray, listen, now:  I started out to frolic at a venture,  When two fine animals appeared  Before my eyes,  And filled me with surprise.  One was soft, benign, and sweet,  The other, turbulent, and full of inquietude,  Had a loud voice, piercing and rude,  And on his head a piece of flesh.  A sort of arm raised him up in the air,  As though to fly out of a mesh--  His tail was spread out like a fan.\"  Now it was a cock of which our little mouse,  Made to his mother this fine picture,  Describing him like an enthusiast.  \"He beat,\" said he, \"his flanks,  With his two arms,  Making such a noise and such a din,  That, frightened half to death,  I hurried in.  Although I pique myself upon my courage  And heartily I cursed him in my heart,  For but for him, I'd taken part,  In conversation with the gentle creature,  Who my advances would encourage.  She is velvety, like us, with a long tail,  A modest look, and sparkling eyes,  And is much like a rat. She spies  The objects round her. I turned pale  On hearing the other creature's din,  Or else I should have asked her in.\"  \"My child,\" said the mother, \"this last was a cat,  An enemy of every mouse and rat.  The other a cock, whom do not fear,  Perhaps we may dine on him here.\"    Take care, whatever they may seem,  Of judging people by their mien.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE MONKEY.      The animals, on the death of the lion,    During his life, prince of the country,  Resolved to elect a king to try on    The regal crown, and chose a monkey.  Because after the animals had all  Tried on the regal crown, or let it fall,  Because their heads were all too big,  Or too small, too horned, or too thick,  The monkey slipped through it;  And with it cut up many a trick,  Which they all thought refined,  And chose him with one mind.  Only the fox regretted the election,  And swore to reign in his defection.  He came and made his compliment;  \"Sire,\" said he, \"I know a treasure meant  For your high majesty. I will show  The spot where it lies hid.\"  The monkey went at Reynard's bid--  And was caught in a trap.  The fox exclaimed,  \"How do you think to govern us,  When, after all, with all your fuss,  You cannot well, do what you may,  Keep e'en yourself out of harm's way.\"  The animals agreed,  That royal power suits very few indeed.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE HORSE AND THE ASS.      An ass accompanied by a horse uncourteous,  Who only had his harness on his back;  And the poor jackass staggered  'Neath the load of vegetable and a pack;  He begged the horse to help him,  If he could--  But not a single bit,  The other would.  \"I ask,\" said the poor beast,  \"A little pity--  Help me at least,  To reach the city.\"  The horse refused,  And got his due,  For the ass died.  The farmer's man  Stripped off the skin of honest Ben,  And made the horse, whom they espied,  Drag on the skin and the cart beside.      MORAL.    'Tis wise to lend our aid    To others in distress,  We often thus are made    The means of happiness.  The churlish, unkind man    His neighbor's death may cause,  And have to help his family,    Through taxes and the laws.          [Illustration]    THE ASTROLOGER WHO FELL  INTO A WELL.      An astrologer, of high ambition,  While star-gazing fell down  Into a well. \"Sage gentleman,\"  Remarked the people of the town,  \"How did you think to read the stars, old man,  When you cannot preserve your own position.\"  This adventure in itself, without going further,  Might serve as a lesson, to most of mankind,  For of us mortals, a certain part inclines,  To the belief, that, with the help of mind,  The book of Destiny may easily be read,  But this book, by Homer and his disciples sung,  What is it called but _Chance_, by ancients,  And by us Christians named Providence instead.  Now in Chance there can no science be,  Or why should it be called by them _Chance_--  And things uncertain, who knows in advance?  If all depends upon the fixed decree,  Of Him who does all things, and nothing does unwisely.  How should we read his will,  And know that which from us he would conceal?  Wherefore watch the stars so nicely,  To know how to avoid inevitable woe;  Or how, in future times, our fate will go;  To make us, in the midst of pleasure, sad,  Or with predicted evil, drive us mad,  Convert all blessings into curses dire?  Is this the knowledge to which we aspire,  Is it an error or a crime thus to believe  That future destiny can thus be known?  In place of star-gazing above our head,  Let us confide ourselves to the Great One.  The firmament exists, the stars go on their way,  And the sun shines upon us every day;  And every day, the day is lost in night,  Without our knowing aught else from the sight.  That the seasons come, the crops are ripe,  And in what wood we should look out for snipe,  And some few other things, but for the change  Of day to night, by which the world doth range,  It has not aught to do with Destiny.  Quacks, and ye compilers of horoscopes,  Quit all the courts of princes in Europe,  And take with you all mischief makers    You deserve belief no more than they do.      MORAL.    This astrologer in the well,  Resembles all of his false art,  Who while they are in danger, dream  That in the stars, they read the happiest theme.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE ANIMALS SICK WITH THE  PLAGUE.      A scourge which spread terror,  Invented by heaven to punish earth--  The plague (if to name it be no error)  Was making every animal  To curse his birth.  In one day it might have enriched Acheron,  And upon beasts made busy war.  Amongst them all there was not one,  But, sick and ailing, was complaining sore;  All did not die, but each was ill--  Not one strove now to eat his fill,  No meat excited them to taste,  Nor did the wolves again lay waste,  The innocent prey.  Even the doves fled from each other,  And cooed no more the live-long day.  The lion held war counsel--\"My brother,\"  Said he, addressing each in turn,  \"I think that heaven hath allowed  This punishment on us to fall  For the sins we have disavowed.  Now I for one will confess all,  And let him who is most to blame,  Be slaughtered in the others' name.  Perhaps he may obtain a common cure,  For history tells us that in like cases,  The guilty die in others' places;  Let us not then be false to Nature,  Let us confess our faults--in fine  I will the first acknowledge mine;  And I avow, that oft I keep  A serious tax on harmless sheep.  What had they done,  In naught offended--  Yet I their quiet lives have ended.  Sometimes, with sorrow be it heard,  I e'en have eaten the shepherd,  And I acknowledge all--  And I will die like a quiet bird--  If my death keep you from your fall.  It must be hoped now in all justice,  That he who is most guilty perish.\"  \"Sire,\" said the fox, \"you are too good a king  To die for any trivial thing;  Your simples are too nice.  Eat sheep, and why not?  Is it a sin? is it a vice?  No, sire, you did them honor;  And as for shepherds, I desire,  That over us their false empire  Should cease, and we have all we want  Of sheep and fleece.\"  So said the fox, flatterers applaud,  The tiger, bear, and other powers they laud,  Even for their most violent offence.  All quarrelsome people,  Down to the mastiffs,  Were little saints.  But when the donkey's turn came on,  They heard him with many ifs.  He said, \"I now remember  That by a monk's garden passing,  (It was late in December,  And my strength soon faints,)  I ate a leaf of some dry plant,  And e'en now I with terror pant.\"  They seized upon him and devoured,  And said he was the cause  Of heaven's anger being lowered.    With interested judges, _right_  Is always on the side of _might_.          [Illustration]    THE CANDLE.      It was in the home of the Olympian gods,  That bees first lodged, 'tis said,  On Mount Hymettus; and thitherwards  Came zephyrs with light tread.  When from the hives, the honey,  Had all been taken out,  As there remained naught but wax,  Some candles were, for money,  Carefully made and sold in packs.  One of these candles on a certain day  Seeing that clay by fire was turned to brick,  Thought he could harden his body the same;  And"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21200"],[0,"The Letters of Cicero, Volume 1 (#12)"],[1," have been attempting  it already on my own account, I will now urge the point more earnestly  and press him closer, as I think I gather from your letter that you are  so set upon it. This much I should like you to realize, that he is very  deeply offended; but since I cannot see any serious ground for it, I  feel confident that he will do as I wish and yield to my influence. As  for my statues and Hermeracles, pray put them on board, as you say in  your letter, at your very earliest convenience, and anything else you  light upon that may seem to you appropriate to the place you wot of,  especially anything you think suitable to a palaestra and gymnasium. I  say this because I am sitting there as I write, so that the very place  itself reminds me. Besides these, I commission you to get me some  medallions to let into the walls of my little entrance-court, and two  engraved stone-curbs. Mind you don't engage your library to anyone,  however keen a lover you may find; for I am hoarding up my little  savings expressly to secure that resource for my old age. As to my  brother, I trust that all is as I have ever wished and tried to make it.  There are many signs of that result--not least that your sister is  _enceinte_. As for my election, I don't forget that I left the question  entirely to you, and I have all along been telling our common friends  that I have not only not asked you to come, but have positively  forbidden you to do so, because I understood that it was much more  important to you to carry through the business you have now in hand,  than it is to me to have you at my election. I wish you therefore to  feel as though you had been sent to where you are in my interests. Nay,  you will find me feeling towards you, and hear of it from others,  exactly as though my success were obtained not only in your presence,  but by your direct agency.    Tulliola gives notice of action against you. She is dunning me as your  surety.          VII (A I, 11)    TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)    ROME      [Sidenote: B.C. 67, AET. 39]    I was doing so before spontaneously, and have been since greatly stirred  by your two letters, with their earnest expressions to the same effect.  Besides, Sallustius has been always at my side to prompt me to spare no  pains to induce Lucceius to be reconciled to you. But after doing  everything that could be done, not only did I fail to renew his old  feelings towards you, but I could not even succeed in eliciting the  reason of his alienation. On his part, however, he keeps harping on that  arbitration case of his, and the other matters which I knew very well  before you left Rome were causing him offence. Still, he has certainly  got something else fixed deeper in his mind; and this no letters _from_  you, and no commissioning of me will obliterate as easily as you will do  in a personal interview, I don't mean merely by your words, but by the  old familiar expression of your face--if only you think it worth while,  as you will if you will listen to me, and be willing to act with your  habitual kindness. Finally, you need not wonder why it is that, whereas  I intimated in my letters that I felt hopeful of his yielding to my  influence, I now appear to have no such confidence; for you can scarcely  believe how much more stubborn his sentiment appears to me than I  expected, and how much more obstinate he is in this anger. However, all  this will either be cured when you come, or will only be painful to the  party in fault.    As to the sentence in your letter, \"you suppose by this time I am  praetor-elect,\" let me tell you that there is no class of people at Rome  so harassed by every kind of unreasonable difficulty as candidates for  office; and that no one knows when the elections will be.[35] However,  you will hear all this from Philadelphus. Pray despatch at the earliest  opportunity what you have bought for my \"Academia.\" I am surprisingly  delighted with the mere thought of that place, to say nothing of its  actual occupation. Mind also not to let anyone else have your books.  Reserve them, as you say in your letter, for me. I am possessed with the  utmost longing for them, as I am with a loathing for affairs of every  other kind, which you will find in an incredibly worse position than  when you left them.[36]    [Footnote 35: The _comitia_ were twice postponed this year. Apparently  the voting for Cicero had in each case been completed, so that he is  able to say that he was \"thrice returned at the head of the poll by an  unanimous vote\" (_de Imp. Pomp._ Sec. 2). The postponement of the elections  was probably connected with the struggles of the senate to hinder the  legislation (as to bribery) of the Tribune, Gaius Cornelius (Dio, 36,  38-39).]    [Footnote 36: The first allusion in these letters to the disturbed  position of public affairs. See the passage of Dio quoted in the  previous note. There were so many riots in the interval between the  proclamation and the holding of the elections, not without bloodshed,  that the senate voted the consuls a guard.]          VIII (A I, 3)      [Sidenote: B.C. 66. Coss., M. AEmilius Lepidus, L. Volcatius Tullus.]         In this year Cicero was praetor, and delivered his first extant       public speech (_apud populum_) in support of the _lex Manilia_,       which gave Pompey the command in the Mithridatic War with the       provinces of Asia and Bithynia. The strict Optimates opposed it.       Cicero supported it on the grounds of the importance of the war and       the proofs Pompey had already given of military ability, courage,       personal prestige, and good fortune. He takes occasion to point out       the mischief done to the Roman name by oppressive or fraudulent       governors and imperators. In this same year he delivered one of his       ablest speeches in court in defending A. Cluentius Habitus on a       charge of poisoning. At the consular elections this year the two       first elected were disabled for bribery.      TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)    ROME, JANUARY    [Sidenote: B.C. 66, AET. 40]    I have to inform you of the death of your grandmother from pining at  your long absence, and at the same time because she was afraid that the  Latin towns would revolt and fail to bring the victims up the Alban  Mount. I presume that L. Saufeius will send you a letter of condolence  on the subject.[37] I am expecting you here in the course of January--is  it a mere rumour or does it come from letters of yours to others? For to  me you have not mentioned the subject. The statues which you got for me  have been landed at Caieta. I haven't seen them, for I have been unable  to leave Rome. I have sent a man to clear the freightage. I am  exceedingly obliged to you for having taken so much trouble to get them,  and so reasonably. As to your frequent remarks in your letters about  pacifying my friend, I have done everything I could and tried every  expedient; but he is inveterate against you to a surprising degree, on  what suspicions, though I think you have been told, you shall yet learn  from me when you come. I failed to restore Sallustius[38] to his old  place in his affections, and yet he was on the spot. I tell you this  because the latter used to find fault with me in regard to you. Well, he  has found by personal experience that _he_ is not so easy to pacify, and  that on my part no zeal has been lacking either on his or your behalf. I  have betrothed Tulliola to C. Piso Frugi, son of Lucius.[39]    [Footnote 37: The point of this frigid joke is not clear. Was the  grandmother really dead? What was she to do with the Latin _feriae_? Mr.  Strachan Davidson's explanation is perhaps the best, that Cicero means  that the old lady was thinking of the Social War in B.C. 89, when the  loyalty of the Latin towns must have been a subject of anxiety. She is  in her dotage and only remembers old scares. This is understanding  _civitates_ with _Latinae_. Others understand _feriae_ or _mulieres_.  Saufeius, a Roman eques, was an Epicurean, who would hold death to be no  evil. He was a close friend of Atticus, who afterwards saved his  property from confiscation by the Triumvirs (Nep. _Att._ 12).]    [Footnote 38: Cneius Sallustius, a learned friend of Cicero's, of whom  we shall often hear again.]    [Footnote 39: C. Calpurnius Piso, quaestor B.C. 58, died in B.C. 57. The  marriage took place in B.C. 63.]          IX (A I, 4)    TO ATTICUS (AT ATHENS)    ROME      [Sidenote: B.C. 65, AET. 41]    You keep on making me expect you again and again. Only the other day,  when I thought you on the point of arriving, I was suddenly put off by  you till Quintilis (July). Now, however, I _do_ think that you should  come at the time you mention if you possibly can. You will thereby be in  time for my brother Quintus's election, will pay me a long-deferred  visit, and will settle the dispute with Acutilius. This latter Peducaeus  also suggested my mentioning to you, for I think it is full time that  you settled that affair. My good offices are at your service and always  have been so. Here at Rome I have conducted the case of Gaius Macer with  a popular approval surpassing belief and unparalleled. Though I had been  inclined to take a lenient view of his case, yet I gained much more  substantial advantage from the popular approval on his condemnation  than I should have got from his gratitude if he had been acquitted.[40]  I am very glad to hear what you say about the Hermathena. It is an  ornament appropriate to my \"Academia\" for two reasons: Hermes is a sign  common to all gymnasia, Minerva specially of this particular one. So I  would have you, as you say, adorn the place with the other objects also,  and the more the better. The statues which you sent me before I have not  yet seen. They are in my villa at Formiae, whither I am at this moment  thinking of going. I shall get them all transferred to my Tusculan  villa. If I find myself with more than I"]]]
