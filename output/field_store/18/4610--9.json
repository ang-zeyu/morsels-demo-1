His hairiness was the  one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him  at the window.  I don't know that there is anything else.\"    \"The associate?\"    \"Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that.  But you will know all  about it soon enough.  How sweet the morning air is!  See how that one  little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo.  Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank.  It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a  stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty  ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces  of nature!  Are you well up in your Jean Paul?\"    \"Fairly so.  I worked back to him through Carlyle.\"    \"That was like following the brook to the parent lake.  He makes one  curious but profound remark.  It is that the chief proof of man's real  greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you  see, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a  proof of nobility.  There is much food for thought in Richter.  You  have not a pistol, have you?\"    \"I have my stick.\"    \"It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get  to their lair.  Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns  nasty I shall shoot him dead.\"  He took out his revolver as he spoke,  and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the  right-hand pocket of his jacket.    We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the  half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis. Now,  however, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where  laborers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were  taking down shutters and brushing door-steps.  At the square-topped  corner public houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking men  were emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their  morning wet.  Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as  we passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to  the left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an  occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent.    We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found  ourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the  side-streets to the east of the Oval.  The men whom we pursued seemed  to have taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of  escaping observation.  They had never kept to the main road if a  parallel side-street would serve their turn.  At the foot of Kennington  Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles  Street.  Where the latter street turns into Knight's Place, Toby ceased  to advance, but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked  and the other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision.  Then he  waddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to  ask for sympathy in his embarrassment.    \"What the deuce is the matter with the dog?\" growled Holmes. \"They  surely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon.\"    \"Perhaps they stood here for some time,\" I suggested.    \"Ah! it's all right.  He's off again,\" said my companion, in a tone of  relief.    He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up  his mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he  had not yet shown.  The scent appeared to be much hotter than before,  for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his  leash and tried to break into a run.  I cold see by the gleam in  Holmes's eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey.    Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and  Nelson's large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. Here the  dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate into  the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work.  On the dog  raced through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage,  between two wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang  upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it  had been brought.  With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood  upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of  appreciation.  The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley  were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the  smell of creasote.    Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst  simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.        Chapter VIII    The Baker Street Irregulars    \"What now?\" I asked.  \"Toby has lost his character for infallibility.\"    \"He acted according to his lights,\" said Holmes, lifting him down from  the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard.  \"If you consider  how much creasote is carted about London in one day, it is no great  wonder that our trail should have been crossed.  It is much used now,  especially for the seasoning of wood.  Poor Toby is not to blame.\"    \"We must get on the main scent again, I suppose.\"    \"Yes.  And, fortunately, we have no distance to go.  Evidently what  puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight's Place was that there were two  different trails running in opposite directions. We took the wrong one.  It only remains to follow the other.\"    There was no difficulty about this.  On leading Toby to the place where  he had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finally  dashed off in a fresh direction.    \"We must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the  creasote-barrel came from,\" I observed.    \"I had thought of that.  But you notice that he keeps on the pavement,  whereas the barrel passed down the roadway.  No, we are on the true  scent now.\"    It tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Place  and Prince's Street.  At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to  the water's edge, where there was a small wooden wharf.  Toby led us to  the very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark  current beyond.    \"We are out of luck,\" said Holmes.  \"They have taken to a boat here.\"  Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the  edge of the wharf.  We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he  sniffed earnestly, he made no sign.    Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden  placard slung out through the second window.  \"Mordecai Smith\" was  printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, \"Boats to hire by  the hour or day.\"  A second inscription above the door informed us that  a steam launch was kept,--a statement which was confirmed by a great  pile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and  his face assumed an ominous expression.    \"This looks bad,\" said he.  \"These fellows are sharper than I expected.  They seem to have covered their tracks.  There has, I fear, been  preconcerted management here.\"    He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little,  curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish,  red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand.    \"You come back and be washed, Jack,\" she shouted.  \"Come back, you  young imp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he'll  let us hear of it.\"    \"Dear little chap!\" said Holmes, strategically.  \"What a rosy-cheeked  young rascal!  Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?\"    The youth pondered for a moment.  \"I'd like a shillin',\" said he.    \"Nothing you would like better?\"    \"I'd like two shillin' better,\" the prodigy answered, after some  thought.    \"Here you are, then!  Catch!--A fine child, Mrs. Smith!\"    \"Lor' bless you, sir, he is that, and forward.  He gets a'most too much  for me to manage, 'specially when my man is away days at a time.\"    \"Away, is he?\" said Holmes, in a disappointed voice.  \"I am sorry for  that, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.\"    \"He's been away since yesterday mornin', sir, and, truth to tell, I am  beginnin' to feel frightened about him.  But if it was about a boat,  sir, maybe I could serve as well.\"    \"I wanted to hire his steam launch.\"    \"Why, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone.  That's what puzzles me; for I know there ain't more coals in her than  would take her to about Woolwich and back.  If he'd been away in the  barge I'd ha' thought nothin'; for many a time a job has taken him as  far as Gravesend, and then if there was much doin' there he might ha'  stayed over.  But what good is a steam launch without coals?\"    \"He might have bought some at a wharf down the river.\"    \"He might, sir, but it weren't his way.  Many a time I've heard him  call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don't  like that wooden-legged man, wi' his ugly face and outlandish talk.  What did he want always knockin' about here for?\"    \"A wooden-legged man?\" said Holmes, with bland surprise.    \"Yes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that's called more'n once for my  old man.  It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what's more,  my man knew he was comin', for he had steam up in the launch.  I tell  you straight, sir, I don't feel easy in my mind about it.\"    \"But, my dear Mrs. Smith,\" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, \"You  are frightening yourself about nothing.  How could you possibly tell  that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night?  I don't quite  understand how you can be so sure.\"    \"His voice, sir.  I knew his voice, which is kind o' thick and foggy.  He tapped at the winder,--about three it would be.  'Show a leg,  matey,' says he:  'time to turn out guard.'  My old man woke up  Jim,--that's my eldest,--and away they went, without so much as a word  to me.  I could hear the wooden leg clackin' on the stones.\"    \"And was this wooden-leg"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20987"],[0,"Story of the War in South Africa, 1899-1900 (#12)"],[1," insufficient number of horses and their  debility have doubtless accounted {p.098} for much of the delay and  seeming languor of action, which has appeared otherwise inexplicable;  the utter weakness of the poor beasts having indeed been expressly  alleged as the reason for failure of cavalry or of artillery in more  than one critical moment. That the supply forwarded has been large, if  nevertheless falling short of the demand, is shown by the transport  figures, according to which, in round numbers, 50,000 horses and  39,000 mules had been shipped by the end of March. Half of the former,  and the greater part of the latter, were drawn from North and South  America, from Australia, and from the Mediterranean. To these figures  is to be added another, yet uncertain because future, but which, when  ascertained, will probably double the number of horses and mules  actually used in the war, raising it, including those obtained in  South Africa itself, to nearly 200,000. The monthly waste has been  roughly reckoned at 5,000.    The size and multiplicity of these various operations enforce the  homely, but always to be remembered, maxim that \"War is business,\" and  that in all its aspects; business in {p.099} which, like every other,  the aim must be the best results with the least expenditure--of money,  of labour, and of life. An intermediate difficulty in the problem of  getting men, horses, and supplies from England to the front of  operations, and one which probably would not antecedently occur to a  person inexperienced in such transactions, was the inadequate  facilities at Cape Town itself, as well as of the railroads, for  handling the mass of freight, animate and inanimate, unexpectedly  thrust upon them. A third-class port cannot be suddenly raised to the  business of one of the first class, and be found either competent or  convenient. Consequently, the congestion at the docks, wharves, and  railroads was very great. Many ships were kept waiting two months, or  even more, for discharge; a fact which means not merely expense,  though that is bad enough, but delay in operations, which in turn may  be the loss of opportunity--and the equivalent of this again is  prolongation of war, loss of life, and other miseries.    The practical lesson of this embarrassment at Cape Town should not be  lost to those who {p.100} assume too lightly that the traffic of the  Suez Canal can in time of war be turned to the Cape route. The  question of necessity for coaling at Cape Town, and the facilities for  it should at least be exhaustively studied before accepting this  solution as final, or even probable. It is evident that, for the  operations of this war, the use of Port Elizabeth, Port Alfred, and  East London, although they have no docks at which steamers can lie and  discharge, would to some extent relieve Cape Town; but that such  relief should be effective at the front, it was necessary also that  the railroads from them should be securely held up to their junctions  with the main line. This was not the case at first.    It may be added, for the benefit of American readers, that this  question of local congestion, and of consequent dislocation and delay  of traffic and of transport, is worthy of consideration by those among  us who may think that the interruption of our coasting trade, or the  blockade of one or two principal harbours, can be met by transferring  the business, of the former to the railroads, of the {p.101} latter  to other ports not blockaded. This is not so, because the local  conveniences and methods, which have developed under the sifting tests  of experience and actual use, cannot be transferred at short notice;  and until such transfer has been made, distribution cannot proceed.  The body economic and commercial will be in the state of the body  physical whose liver is congested, whose blood therefore circulates  poorly, with consequent imperfect nutrition and general disorder of  the system; much where little ought to be, and little where much.          CHAPTER IV {p.102}    THE WESTERN FRONTIER TO MAGERSFONTEIN AND STORMBERG--OPERATIONS OF  GENERAL FRENCH ABOUT COLESBERG      As was the case a century ago, on the eve of the French Revolution,  Great Britain last year indulged too long her dream of peace, and  awaked from it too late for timely preparation. Like a man who starts  behindhand with his day, the catching up meant double worry, if not  double work. Hildyard's brigade, which sailed October 20, had, thirty  days before, been preceded by two hospital ships, three batteries of  field artillery and a thousand infantry;[7] the last-named getting  away on the 19th, only one day before Hildyard. No British field  troops had then reached South Africa, save a couple of {p.103}  battalions additional to Cape Colony, and the reinforcements to Sir  George White drawn mainly from India, which, with most of his corps in  Natal, and despite his well-directed energy, the Boers by their  superior numbers were able to round up and corral in Ladysmith in  three weeks after their ultimatum was issued. There were then also on  the way some fifteen hundred of the Army Service Corps, an organised  body of men trained for the supply and transport service of the army,  and of skilled mechanics, whose duties are to construct and maintain  works of various kinds for the facilitation of army supply--transport  and depot. These had sailed in the early days of October.                       [Footnote 7: There may have been one or two more                     battalions of infantry, but I have not been able to                     trace such.]    Such was the mighty enginery antecedently set in motion, to crush the  liberties of the Transvaal. An interesting further illustration of the  way decision was precipitated toward the end is found in the fact that  Sir George White was gazetted Governor of Gibraltar in the last week  in August, and on September 15 sailed to command the forces in Natal.    \"My small experience,\" wrote Steevens about October 12 from the  well-advanced station {p.104} of Stormberg Junction, in Cape Colony,  \"has been confined to wars you could put your fingers on; for this war  I have been looking long enough and have not found it.... We are  heavily outnumbered, and have adopted no heroic plan of abandoning the  indefensible. We have an irregular force of mounted infantry at  Mafeking, a regiment (regulars) at Kimberley, a regiment and a half at  De Aar\" (the most important of junctions), \"half of the Berkshires at  Naauwport, the other half here.\" Stormberg and Naauwport were also  junctions, secondary only, if secondary, to De Aar, in the strategic  importance that always attaches to cross-roads. \"The famous fighting  Northumberlands came crawling up behind our train, and may now be at  Naauwport or De Aar. Total, say, 4,100 infantry, of whom 600 mounted;  no cavalry, no field guns. The Boer force available against these  isolated positions might be very reasonably put at 12,000 mounted  infantry, with perhaps a score of guns.... It is dangerous--and yet  nobody cares. There is nothing to do but wait--for the Army Corps that  has not yet left England. Tiny forces, half {p.105} a battalion in  front, and no support behind--nothing but long lines of railway with  ungarrisoned posts hundreds of miles at the far end of them. It is  very dangerous. No supports at this moment nearer than England.\"[8]                       [Footnote 8: \"From Cape Town to Ladysmith,\" pp.                     16-20.]    In this brief and pregnant summary the reader will note outlined the  elements characteristic of all strategic situations: the bases, the  seaports; the communications, the railway lines; the front of  operations, the frontier of the Orange Free State, or rather, perhaps,  in this defensive--or defenceless--stage, the railroad line parallel  to it, which joins De Aar, Naauwport and Stormberg.    Dangerous, sure enough; how much so needs only a glance at the map to  show. Before reinforcements could arrive Sir George White was shut up  in Ladysmith by forces double his own. These he held there, it is  true; and the fatal delay of the Boers before his lines, reflected in  their no less fatal inactivity on the frontier of the Cape Colony,  whence Steevens wrote the words quoted, doubtless threw away the game;  but we are now speaking, as he was then writing, of the time {p.106}  when the cards had only been dealt and the hand was yet to play. Put  your marks on each of the places named--Mafeking, Kimberley, De Aar,  Naauwport, Stormberg--note their individual and relative importance,  the distances severing them from one another, the small bodies of men  scattered among them, incapable through weakness and remoteness of  supporting each other, and with no common supports behind. Mafeking is  from Kimberley 223 miles; Kimberley from De Aar, 146; De Aar from  Naauwport, 69; Naauwport from Stormberg 80, as the crow flies over a  difficult country, at least 130 by rail. All three junctions with  their intervening lines of rail, bridges, culverts and all, are little  over fifty miles from the Orange River, which hereabout forms the  boundary separating Cape Colony from the Free State. And White is  about to be invested in Ladysmith, and the Army Corps has not yet left  England.    The average length of a transport's voyage from the United Kingdom to  Cape Town, as determined from 162 records, was 22-1/6 days. The first,  with Hildyard's brigade, accomplished it {p.107} in 20 days, arriving  November 9; the last of the four took 25 days, coming in on the 14th.  With them, and their one predecessor, 6,000 additional troops were at  the latter date--five weeks after the Boers' ultimatum became  operative--landed at the far base of operations, yet 500 miles by  railroad from the front. Kimberley and Mafeking were then already  invested, and the bombardment at both places begun. The British troops  had"]]]
