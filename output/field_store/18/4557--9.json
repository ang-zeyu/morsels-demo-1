The  Battler fell into a clinch, but the Cyclone broke away  and, measuring his distance, picked up a haymaker from the  floor and put it over. Percy down and out.    \"Interviewed by our representative after the fight,  Cyclone Jim said: 'The issue was never in doubt. I was  handicapped at the outset by the fact that I was under the  impression that I was fighting three twin-brothers, and I  missed several opportunities of putting over the winning  wallop by attacking the outside ones. It was only in the  second round that I decided to concentrate my assault on  the one in the middle, when the affair speedily came to a  conclusion. I shall not adopt pugilism as a profession.  The prizes are attractive, but it is too much like work.'\"    Bayliss ceased, and silence fell upon the room.    \"Is that all?\"    \"That is all, sir.\"    \"And about enough.\"    \"Very true, sir.\"    \"You know, Bayliss,\" said Jimmy thoughtfully, rolling over on the  couch, \"life is peculiar, not to say odd. You never know what is  waiting for you round the corner. You start the day with the  fairest prospects, and before nightfall everything is as rocky  and ding-basted as stig tossed full of doodlegammon. Why is this,  Bayliss?\"    \"I couldn't say, sir.\"    \"Look at me. I go out to spend a happy evening, meaning no harm  to any one, and I come back all blue with the blood of the  aristocracy. We now come to a serious point. Do you think my  lady stepmother has read that sporting chronicle?\"    \"I fancy not, Mr. James.\"    \"On what do you base these words of comfort?\"    \"Mrs. Crocker does not read the halfpenny papers, sir.\"    \"True! She does not. I had forgotten. On the other hand the  probability that she will learn about the little incident from  other sources is great. I think the merest prudence suggests that  I keep out of the way for the time being, lest I be fallen upon  and questioned. I am not equal to being questioned this morning.  I have a headache which starts at the soles of my feet and gets  worse all the way up. Where is my stepmother?\"    \"Mrs. Crocker is in her room, Mr. James. She ordered the car to  be brought round at once. It should be here at any moment now,  sir. I think Mrs. Crocker intends to visit the Park before  luncheon.\"    \"Is she lunching out?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then, if I pursue the excellent common-sense tactics of the  lesser sand-eel, which as you doubtless know buries itself tail  upwards in the mud on hearing the baying of the eel-hounds and  remains in that position till the danger is past, I shall be able  to postpone an interview. Should you be questioned as to my  whereabouts, inflate your chest and reply in a clear and manly  voice that I have gone out, you know not where. May I rely on  your benevolent neutrality, Bayliss?\"    \"Very good, Mr. James.\"    \"I think I will go and sit in my father's den. A man may lie hid  there with some success as a rule.\"    Jimmy heaved himself painfully off the sofa, blinked, and set out  for the den, where his father, in a deep arm-chair, was smoking a  restful pipe and reading the portions of the daily papers which  did not deal with the game of cricket.    Mr. Crocker's den was a small room at the back of the house. It  was not luxurious, and it looked out onto a blank wall, but it  was the spot he liked best in all that vast pile which had once  echoed to the tread of titled shoes; for, as he sometimes  observed to his son, it had the distinction of being the only  room on the ground floor where a fellow could move without  stubbing his toe on a countess or an honourable. In this peaceful  backwater he could smoke a pipe, put his feet up, take off his  coat, and generally indulge in that liberty and pursuit of  happiness to which the Constitution entitles a free-born  American. Nobody ever came there except Jimmy and himself.    He did not suspend his reading at his son's entrance. He muttered  a welcome through the clouds, but he did not raise his eyes.  Jimmy took the other arm-chair, and began to smoke silently. It  was the unwritten law of the den that soothing silence rather  than aimless chatter should prevail. It was not until a quarter  of an hour had passed that Mr. Crocker dropped his paper and  spoke.    \"Say, Jimmy, I want to talk to you.\"    \"Say on. You have our ear.\"    \"Seriously.\"    \"Continue--always, however, keeping before you the fact that I am  a sick man. Last night was a wild night on the moors, dad.\"    \"It's about your stepmother. She was talking at breakfast about  you. She's sore at you for giving Spike Dillon lunch at the  Carlton. You oughtn't to have taken him there, Jimmy. That's what  got her goat. She was there with a bunch of swells and they had  to sit and listen to Spike talking about his half-scissors hook.\"    \"What's their kick against Spike's half-scissors hook? It's a  darned good one.\"    \"She said she was going to speak to you about it. I thought I'd  let you know.\"    \"Thanks, dad. But was that all?\"    \"All.\"    \"All that she was going to speak to me about? Sure there was  nothing else?\"    \"She didn't say anything about anything else.\"    \"Then she _doesn't_ know! Fine!\"    Mr. Crocker's feet came down from the mantelpiece with a crash.    \"Jimmy! You haven't been raising Cain again?\"    \"No, no, dad. Nothing serious. High-spirited Young Patrician  stuff, the sort of thing that's expected of a fellow in my  position.\"    Mr. Crocker was not to be comforted.    \"Jimmy, you've got to pull up. Honest, you have. I don't care for  myself. I like to see a boy having a good time. But your  stepmother says you're apt to queer us with the people up top,  the way you're going on. Lord knows I wouldn't care if things  were different, but I'll tell you exactly how I stand. I didn't  get wise till this morning. Your stepmother sprang it on me  suddenly. I've often wondered what all this stuff was about, this  living in London and trailing the swells. I couldn't think what  was your stepmother's idea. Now I know. Jimmy, she's trying to  get them to make me a peer!\"    \"What!\"    \"Just that. And she says--\"    \"But, dad, this is rich! This is comedy of a high order! A peer!  Good Heavens, if it comes off, what shall I be? This title  business is all so complicated. I know I should have to change my  name to Hon. Rollo Cholmondeley or the Hon. Aubrey Marjoribanks,  but what I want to know is which? I want to be prepared for the  worst.\"    \"And you see, Jimmy, these people up top, the guys who arrange  the giving of titles, are keeping an eye on you, because you  would have the title after me and naturally they don't want to  get stung. I gathered all that from your stepmother. Say, Jimmy,  I'm not asking a lot of you, but there is just one thing you can  do for me without putting yourself out too much.\"    \"I'll do it, dad, if it kills me. Slip me the info!\"    \"Your stepmother's friend Lady Corstorphine's nephew . . .\"    \"It's not the sort of story to ask a man with a headache to  follow. I hope it gets simpler as it goes along.\"    \"Your stepmother wants you to be a good fellow and make friends  with this boy. You see, his father is in right with the Premier  and has the biggest kind of a pull when it comes to handing out  titles.\"    \"Is that all you want? Leave it to me. Inside of a week I'll be  playing kiss-in-the-ring with him. The whole force of my sunny  personality shall be directed towards making him love me. What's  his name?\"    \"Lord Percy Whipple.\"    Jimmy's pipe fell with a clatter.    \"Dad, pull yourself together! Reflect! You know you don't  seriously mean Lord Percy Whipple.\"    \"Eh?\"    Jimmy laid a soothing hand on his father's shoulder.    \"Dad, prepare yourself for the big laugh. This is where you throw  your head back and roar with honest mirth. I met Lord Percy  Whipple last night at the Six Hundred Club. Words ensued. I fell  upon Percy and beat his block off! How it started, except that we  both wanted the same table, I couldn't say. 'Why, that I cannot  tell,' said he, 'but 'twas a famous victory!' If I had known,  dad, nothing would have induced me to lay a hand upon Perce, save  in the way of kindness, but, not even knowing who he was, it  would appear from contemporary accounts of the affair that I just  naturally sailed in and expunged the poor, dear boy!\"    The stunning nature of this information had much the same effect  on Mr. Crocker as the announcement of his ruin has upon the Good  Old Man in melodrama. He sat clutching the arms of his chair and  staring into space, saying nothing. Dismay was written upon his  anguished countenance.    His collapse sobered Jimmy. For the first time he perceived that  the situation had another side than the humorous one which had  appealed to him. He had anticipated that Mr. Crocker, who as a  general thing shared his notions of what was funny and could be  relied on to laugh in the right place, would have been struck,  like himself, by the odd and pleasing coincidence of his having  picked on for purposes of assault and battery the one young man  with whom his stepmother wished him to form a firm and lasting  friendship. He perceived now that his father was seriously upset.  Neither Jimmy nor Mr. Crocker possessed a demonstrative nature,  but there had always existed between them the deepest affection.  Jimmy loved his father as he loved nobody else in the world, and  the thought of having hurt him was like a physical pain. His  laughter died away and he set himself with a sinking heart to try  to undo the effect of his words.    \"I'm awfully sorry, dad. I had no idea you would care. I wouldn't  have done a fool thing like that for a million dollars if I'd  known. Isn't there anything I can do? Gee whiz! I'll go right  round to Percy now and apologise. I'll lick his boots. Don't you  worry, dad. I'll make it all right.\"    The whirl of words roused Mr. Crocker from his thoughts.    \"It doesn't "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#12)"],[1," have such people in them!\"              Section 13.  How I had a Vision of Lineland        It was the last day but one of the 1999th year of our era, and the  first day of the Long Vacation.  Having amused myself till a late hour  with my favourite recreation of Geometry, I had retired to rest with an  unsolved problem in my mind.  In the night I had a dream.    I saw before me a vast multitude of small Straight Lines (which I  naturally assumed to be Women) interspersed with other Beings still  smaller and of the nature of lustrous points--all moving to and fro in  one and the same Straight Line, and, as nearly as I could judge, with  the same velocity.    A noise of confused, multitudinous chirping or twittering issued from  them at intervals as long as they were moving; but sometimes they  ceased from motion, and then all was silence.    Approaching one of the largest of what I thought to be Women, I  accosted her, but received no answer.  A second and a third appeal on  my part were equally ineffectual.  Losing patience at what appeared to  me intolerable rudeness, I brought my mouth into a position full in  front of her mouth so as to intercept her motion, and loudly repeated  my question, \"Woman, what signifies this concourse, and this strange  and confused chirping, and this monotonous motion to and fro in one and  the same Straight Line?\"      [Illustration 6]    [ASCII approximation follows]                                 My view of Lineland                                    ---------                                  |       |                                  | Myself|                                  |       |                          My eye  o--------         Women  A boy       Men        The KING        Men       A boy  Women    + + + +   -   --- -- -- -- --  (>----<)  -- -- -- -- ---   -   + + + +                                    ^    ^                                  The KING'S eyes                                  much larger than the reality                                  shewing that HIS MAJESTY                                  could see nothing but a point.      \"I am no Woman,\" replied the small Line.  \"I am the Monarch of the  world.  But thou, whence intrudest thou into my realm of Lineland?\"  Receiving this abrupt reply, I begged pardon if I had in any way  startled or molested his Royal Highness; and describing myself as a  stranger I besought the King to give me some account of his dominions.  But I had the greatest possible difficulty in obtaining any information  on points that really interested me; for the Monarch could not refrain  from constantly assuming that whatever was familiar to him must also be  known to me and that I was simulating ignorance in jest.  However, by  persevering questions I elicited the following facts:    It seemed that this poor ignorant Monarch--as he called himself--was  persuaded that the Straight Line which he called his Kingdom, and in  which he passed his existence, constituted the whole of the world, and  indeed the whole of Space.  Not being able either to move or to see,  save in his Straight Line, he had no conception of anything out of it.  Though he had heard my voice when I first addressed him, the sounds had  come to him in a manner so contrary to his experience that he had made  no answer, \"seeing no man\", as he expressed it, \"and hearing a voice as  it were from my own intestines.\"  Until the moment when I placed my  mouth in his World, he had neither seen me, nor heard anything except  confused sounds beating against--what I called his side, but what he  called his INSIDE or STOMACH; nor had he even now the least conception  of the region from which I had come.  Outside his World, or Line, all  was a blank to him; nay, not even a blank, for a blank implies Space;  say, rather, all was non-existent.    His subjects--of whom the small Lines were men and the Points  Women--were all alike confined in motion and eye-sight to that single  Straight Line, which was their World.  It need scarcely be added that  the whole of their horizon was limited to a Point; nor could any one  ever see anything but a Point.  Man, woman, child, thing--each was a  Point to the eye of a Linelander.  Only by the sound of the voice could  sex or age be distinguished.  Moreover, as each individual occupied the  whole of the narrow path, so to speak, which constituted his Universe,  and no one could move to the right or left to make way for passers by,  it followed that no Linelander could ever pass another.  Once  neighbours, always neighbours.  Neighbourhood with them was like  marriage with us.  Neighbours remained neighbours till death did them  part.    Such a life, with all vision limited to a Point, and all motion to a  Straight Line, seemed to me inexpressibly dreary; and I was surprised  to note the vivacity and cheerfulness of the King.  Wondering whether  it was possible, amid circumstances so unfavourable to domestic  relations, to enjoy the pleasures of conjugal union, I hesitated for  some time to question his Royal Highness on so delicate a subject; but  at last I plunged into it by abruptly inquiring as to the health of his  family.  \"My wives and children,\" he replied, \"are well and happy.\"    Staggered at this answer--for in the immediate proximity of the Monarch  (as I had noted in my dream before I entered Lineland) there were none  but Men--I ventured to reply, \"Pardon me, but I cannot imagine how your  Royal Highness can at any time either see or approach their Majesties,  when there are at least half a dozen intervening individuals, whom you  can neither see through, nor pass by?  Is it possible that in Lineland  proximity is not necessary for marriage and for the generation of  children?\"    \"How can you ask so absurd a question?\" replied the Monarch.  \"If it  were indeed as you suggest, the Universe would soon be depopulated.  No, no; neighbourhood is needless for the union of hearts; and the  birth of children is too important a matter to have been allowed to  depend upon such an accident as proximity.  You cannot be ignorant of  this.  Yet since you are pleased to affect ignorance, I will instruct  you as if you were the veriest baby in Lineland.  Know, then, that  marriages are consummated by means of the faculty of sound and the  sense of hearing.    \"You are of course aware that every Man has two mouths or voices--as  well as two eyes--a bass at one and a tenor at the other of his  extremities.  I should not mention this, but that I have been unable to  distinguish your tenor in the course of our conversation.\" I replied  that I had but one voice, and that I had not been aware that his Royal  Highness had two.  \"That confirms my impression,\" said the King, \"that  you are not a Man, but a feminine Monstrosity with a bass voice, and an  utterly uneducated ear.  But to continue.    \"Nature having herself ordained that every Man should wed two wives--\"  \"Why two?\" asked I.  \"You carry your affected simplicity too far\", he  cried.  \"How can there be a completely harmonious union without the  combination of the Four in One, viz. the Bass and Tenor of the Man and  the Soprano and Contralto of the two Women?\" \"But supposing,\" said I,  \"that a man should prefer one wife or three?\" \"It is impossible,\" he  said; \"it is as inconceivable as that two and one should make five, or  that the human eye should see a Straight Line.\"  I would have  interrupted him; but he proceeded as follows:    \"Once in the middle of each week a Law of Nature compels us to move to  and fro with a rhythmic motion of more than usual violence, which  continues for the time you would take to count a hundred and one.  In  the midst of this choral dance, at the fifty-first pulsation, the  inhabitants of the Universe pause in full career, and each individual  sends forth his richest, fullest, sweetest strain.  It is in this  decisive moment that all our marriages are made.  So exquisite is the  adaptation of Bass to Treble, of Tenor to Contralto, that oftentimes  the Loved Ones, though twenty thousand leagues away, recognize at once  the responsive note of their destined Lover; and, penetrating the  paltry obstacles of distance, Love unites the three.  The marriage in  that instant consummated results in a threefold Male and Female  offspring which takes its place in Lineland.\"    \"What!  Always threefold?\" said I.  \"Must one wife then always have  twins?\"    \"Bass-voiced Monstrosity! yes,\" replied the King.  \"How else could the  balance of the Sexes be maintained, if two girls were not born for  every boy?  Would you ignore the very Alphabet of Nature?\" He ceased,  speechless for fury; and some time elapsed before I could induce him to  resume his narrative.    \"You will not, of course, suppose that every bachelor among us finds  his mates at the first wooing in this universal Marriage Chorus.  On  the contrary, the process is by most of us many times repeated.  Few  are the hearts whose happy lot it is at once to recognize in each  other's voices the partner intended for them by Providence, and to fly  into a reciprocal and perfectly harmonious embrace.  With most of us  the courtship is of long duration.  The Wooer's voices may perhaps  accord with one of the future wives, but not with both; or not, at  first, with either; or the Soprano and Contralto may not quite  harmonize.  In such cases Nature has provided that every weekly Chorus  shall bring the three Lovers into closer harmony.  Each trial of voice,  each fresh discovery of discord, almost imperceptibly induces the less  perfect to modify his or her vocal utterance so as to approximate to  the more perfect.  And after many trials and many approximations, the  result is at last achieved.  There comes a day at last, when, while the  wonted Marriage Chorus goes forth from universal Lineland, the three  far-off Lovers suddenly find themselves in exact harmony, and, before  they are awake, the wedded Triplet is rapt"]]]
