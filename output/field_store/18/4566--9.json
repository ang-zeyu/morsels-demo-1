(#12)"],[1,"after his coronation he deplored to Badoer Louis'  victory at Agnadello, and a week later he wrote to the sovereigns of  Europe urging the injustice of their Venetian crusade. In September he  sent Bainbridge, Cardinal-Archbishop of York, to reside at the Papal  Court, and watch over the interests of Venice as well as of England.  \"Italy,\" wrote Badoer, \"was entirely rescued from the barbarians by  the movements of the English King; and, but for that, Ferdinand would  have done nothing.\"[98] Henry vainly endeavoured to persuade  Maximilian, the Venetian's lifelong foe, to accept arbitration; but he  succeeded in inducing the Doge to make his peace with the Pope, and  Julius to remove his ecclesiastical censures. To Ferdinand he declared  that Venice must be preserved as a wall against the Turk, and he  hinted that Ferdinand's own dominions in Italy would, if Venice were  destroyed, \"be unable to resist the ambitious designs of certain   (p. 054)  Christian princes\".[99] The danger was as patent to Julius and  Ferdinand as it was to Henry; and as soon as Ferdinand had induced  Louis to give a favourable verdict in his suit with the Emperor, the  Catholic King was ready to join Henry and the Pope in a league of  defence.                       [Footnote 97: _Ven. Cal._, i., 941, 942, 945; ii.,                     1.]                       [Footnote 98: _L. and P._, i., 922, 932, 3333;                     _Ven. Cal._, ii., 5, 7, 9, 19-22, 28, 33, 39, 40,                     45, 51.]                       [Footnote 99: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 23.]    But, in spite of Venetian, Spanish and papal instigations to \"recover  his noble inheritance in France,\" in spite of his own indignation at  the treatment of Venice, and the orders issued in the first year of  his reign to his subjects to furnish themselves with weapons of war,  for which the long peace had left them unprepared,[100] Henry, or the  peace party in his council, was unwilling to resort to the arbitrament  of arms. He renewed his father's treaties not only with other powers,  but, much to the disgust of Ferdinand, Venice and the Pope, with Louis  himself. His first martial exploit, apart from 1,500 archers whom he  was bound by treaty to send to aid the Netherlands against the Duke of  Guelders,[101] was an expedition for the destruction of the enemies of  the faith.[102] Such an expedition, he once said, he owed to God for  his peaceful accession; at another time he declared[103] that he  cherished, like an heirloom, the ardour against the infidel which he  inherited from his father. He repressed that ardour, it must be added,  with as much success as Henry VII.; and apart from this one youthful  indiscretion, he did not suffer his ancestral zeal to escape into  action. His generous illusions soon vanished before the sordid  realities of European statecraft; and the defence of Christendom   (p. 055)  became with him, as with others, a hollow pretence, a diplomatic  fiction, the infinite varieties of which age could not wither nor  custom stale. Did a monarch wish for peace? Peace at once was  imperative to enable Christian princes to combine against the Turk.  Did he desire war? War became a disagreeable necessity to restrain the  ambition of Christian princes who, \"worse than the infidel,\" disturbed  the peace of Christendom and opened a door for the enemies of the  Church. Nor did the success of Henry's first crusade encourage him to  persist in similar efforts. It sailed from Plymouth in May, 1511, to  join in Ferdinand's attack on the Moors, but it had scarcely landed  when bickerings broke out between the Christian allies, and Ferdinand  informed the English commanders that he had made peace with the  Infidel, to gird his loins for war with the Most Christian King.                       [Footnote 100: _L. and P._, i., 679.]                       [Footnote 101: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 16; _L. and P._,                     i., 1740.]                       [Footnote 102: _L. and P._, i., 1531.]                       [Footnote 103: _Ibid._, ii., 4688; _Ven. Cal._,                     ii., 178.]    In the midst of their preparation against infidels, so runs the  preamble to the treaty in which Henry and Ferdinand signified their  adhesion to the Holy League, they heard that Louis was besieging the  Pope in Bologna.[104] The thought of violent hands being laid on the  Vicar of Christ stirred Henry to a depth of indignation which no  injuries practised against a temporal power could rouse. His ingenuous  deference to the Papacy was in singular contrast to the contempt with  which it was treated by more experienced sovereigns, and they traded  on the weight which Henry always attached to the words of the Pope. He  had read Maximilian grave lectures on his conduct in countenancing the  schismatic _conciliabulum_ assembled by Louis at Pisa.[105] He wrote  to Bainbridge at the Papal Court that he was ready to sacrifice goods,  life and kingdom for the Pope and the Church;[106] and to the      (p. 056)  Emperor that at the beginning of his reign he thought of nothing else  than an expedition against the Infidel. But now he was called by the  Pope and the danger of the Church in another direction; and he  proceeded to denounce the impiety and schism of the French and their  atrocious deeds in Italy. He joined Ferdinand in requiring Louis to  desist from his impious work. Louis turned a deaf ear to their  demands; and in November, 1511, they bound themselves to defend the  Church against all aggression and make war upon the aggressor.                       [Footnote 104: _Sp. Cal._, ii., 59.]                       [Footnote 105: _L. and P._, i., 1828.]                       [Footnote 106: _Ven. Cal._, ii., 177.]           *       *       *       *       *    This reversal of the pacific policy which had marked the first two and  a half years of Henry's reign was not exclusively due to the King's  zeal for the Church. The clerical party of peace in his council was  now divided by the appearance of an ecclesiastic who was far more  remarkable than any of his colleagues, and to whose turbulence and  energy the boldness of English policy must, henceforth, for many years  be mainly ascribed. Thomas Wolsey had been appointed Henry's almoner  at the beginning of his reign, but he exercised no apparent influence  in public affairs. It was not till 1511 that he joined the council,  though during the interval he must have been gradually building up his  ascendancy over the King's mind. To Wolsey, restlessly ambitious for  himself, for Henry, and England, was attributed the responsibility for  the sudden adoption of a spirited foreign policy; and it was in the  preparations for the war of 1512 that his marvellous industry and  grasp of detail first found full scope.    The main attack of the English and Spanish monarchs was to be on   (p. 057)  Guienne,[107] and in May, 1512, Henry went down to Southampton to  speed the departing fleet.[108] It sailed from Cowes under Dorset's  command on 3rd June, and a week later the army disembarked on the  coast of Guipuscoa.[109] There it remained throughout the torrid  summer, awaiting the Spanish King's forces to co-operate in the  invasion of France. But Ferdinand was otherwise occupied. Navarre was  not mentioned in the treaty with Henry, but Navarre was what Ferdinand  had in his mind. It was then an independent kingdom, surrounded on  three sides by Spanish territory, and an easy prey which would serve  to unite all Spain beyond the Pyrenees under Ferdinand's rule. Under  pretence of restoring Guienne to the English crown, Dorset's army had  been enticed to Passages, and there it was used as a screen against  the French, behind which Ferdinand calmly proceeded to conquer  Navarre. It was, he said, impossible to march into France with Navarre  unsubdued in his rear. Navarre was at peace, but it might join the  French, and he invited Dorset to help in securing the prey. Dorset  refused to exceed his commission, but the presence of his army at  Passages was admitted by the Spaniards to be \"quite providential,\"[110]  as it prevented the French from assisting Navarre. English indignation  was loud and deep; men and officers vowed that, but for Henry's  displeasure, they would have called to account the perfidious King.  Condemned to inactivity, the troops almost mutinied; they found it  impossible to live on their wages of sixpence a day (equivalent now to  at least six shillings), drank Spanish wine as if it were English  (p. 058)  beer, and died of dysentery like flies in the autumn. Discipline  relaxed; drill was neglected. Still Ferdinand tarried, and in October,  seeing no hope of an attempt on Guienne that year, the army took  matters into its own hands and embarked for England.[111]                       [Footnote 107: _L. and P._, i., 1980; _Sp. Cal._,                     ii., 59; _Ven. Cal._, ii., 122.]                       [Footnote 108: _Ibid._, ii., 159.]                       [Footnote 109: _L. and P._, i., 3243.]                       [Footnote 110: _Ibid._, i., 3352.]                       [Footnote 111: _L. and P._, i., 3298, 3355; _Ven.                     Cal._, ii., 198, 205. The financial accounts for                     the expedition are in _L. and P._, i., 3762.]    Henry's first military enterprise had ended in disgrace and disaster.  The repute of English soldiers, dimmed by long peace, was now further  tarnished. Henry's own envoys complained of the army's insubordination,  its impatience of the toils, and inexperience of the feats, of war;  and its ignominious return exposed him to the taunts of both friends  and foes. He had been on the point of ordering it home, when it came  of its own accord; but the blow to his authority was not, on that  account, less severe. His irritation was not likely to be soothed when  he realised the extent to which he had been duped by his father-in-law.  Ferdinand was loud in complaints "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20318"],[0,"Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great - Volume 14 (#12)"],[1,"in vain. Aurore detested dogs for dogs'  sake, yet she rode horses astride with a daring that made her husband's  bloodshot eyes bulge in alarm. He didn't much care how fast and hard she  rode at the fences and over the ditches, but he was supposed to follow  her, and this he did not care to do. He had reached an age when a man is  mindful of the lime in his bones, and his 'cross-country riding was  mostly a matter of memory and imagination, and best done around the  convivial table.    Aurore was putting him to a test, that's all. She was proving to him  that she could meet him on his own preserve, give him choice of weapons,  and make him cry for mercy.    Her bent was literature, with music, science and art as side-lines. She  read Montaigne, Rochefoucald, Racine and Moliere, and a modern by the  name of Alfred de Musset, and quoted her authors at inconvenient times.  She flashed quotations and epigrams upon the doughty dragoon in a way he  could neither fend nor parry. At other times she was deeply religious  and tearfully penitent.    In fact, she was living on a skimped allowance of love, and had never  received the attention that a good woman deserves. Her chains were  galling her. She sighed for Paris--forty miles away--Paris and a career.    The epigrams were coming faster, shot in a sort of frenzy and fever. And  when she asked her liege for leave to go to Paris, he granted her  prayer, and agreed to give her ten dollars a week allowance.    She grabbed at the offer, and he bade her Godspeed and good riddance.    So leaving her two children behind, until such a time as she could  provide a home for them, with scanty luggage and light heart and purse,  she started away.    Other women have gone up to Paris from country towns, too, and the  chances are as one to ten thousand that the maelstrom will sweep them  into hades.    But Madame Dudevant was different--in two years she had won her way to  literary fame, and was commanding the jealous admiration of the best  writers of Paris. Her first work was a collaboration with Jules  Sandeau in a novel. Every woman who ever wrote well began by  collaborating with a man. Sandeau had formerly come from Nohant, and how  much he had to do with Madame Dudevant's breaking loose from her  homes-ties no one knows. Anyway, the second novel was written by the  Madame alone, and as a tribute to her friend the name \"George Sand\" was  placed upon the title-page as author. Jules Sandeau, all-'round  hack-writer and critic, was greatly pleased by the compliment of having  his name anglicized and printed on the title-page of \"Indiana,\" but  later he was not so proud of it. George Sand soon proved herself to be a  bigger man than Sandeau.    She was not handsome, either in face or in form. She was inclined to be  stout--was rather short--and her complexion olive. But she lured with  her eyes--great sphinx-like eyes of hazel-brown--that looked men through  and through. Liszt has told us that \"she had eyes like a cow,\" which is  not so bad as Thomas Carlyle's remark that George Eliot had a face like  a horse. George Sand was silent when other women talked, and her look  told in a half-proud, half-sad way that she knew all they knew, and all  she herself knew beside.    Without going into the issue as to what George Sand was not, let us  frankly admit that pain, deprivation, misunderstanding and maternity had  taught her many things not found in books, and that she looked at Fate  out of her wide-open eyes with a gaze that did not blink. She was wise  beyond the lot of women. I was just going to say she was a genius, but I  remember the remark of the De Goncourts to the effect that, \"There are  no women of genius--women of genius are men.\" Possibly the point could  be covered by saying George Sand had a man's head and a woman's heart.    Women did not like her, yet what other woman was ever so honored by  woman as was George Sand in those two matchless sonnets addressed to her  by Elizabeth Barrett Browning?    The amazing energy of George Sand, her finely flowing sentences--all  charged with daring satire and insight into the heart of things--made  her work sought by readers and publishers. Her pen brought her all the  money she needed; and she had secured a divorce from \"That Man,\" and now  had her two children with her in Paris. That she could do her literary  work and still attend to her manifold social duties must ever mark her  as a phenomenon. She was no mere adventuress. That she was systematic,  orderly and abstemious in her habits must go without saying, otherwise  her vitality would not have held out and allowed her to attend the  funerals of nearly all her retainers.    In throwing overboard the Grub Street Sandeau for Franz Liszt, Madame  Dudevant certainly showed discrimination; but in retaining the name of  \"Sand,\" she paid a delicate compliment to the man who first introduced  her to the world of art. Liszt was too strong a man to remain long  captive--he refused to supply the doglike and abject devotion which  Aurore always demanded. Then came Michael de Bourges the learned  counsel, Calmatto the mezzotinter, Delacroix the artist, De Musset the  poet, and Chopin the musician.    It was in the year Eighteen Hundred Thirty-nine, that Chopin and Sand  first met at a parlor musicale, where Chopin was taken by Liszt, half  against his will, simply because George Sand was to be there.    Chopin did not want to meet her.    All Paris had rung with the story of how she and De Musset had gone  together to Venice, and then in less than a year had quarreled and  separated. Both made good copy of the \"poetic interval,\" as George Sand  called it. Chopin was not a stickler for conventionalities, but George  Sand's history, for him, proved her to be coarse and devoid of all the  finer feeling that we prize in women.    Chopin had no fear of her--not he--only he did not care to add to his  circle of acquaintances one so lacking in inward grace and delicacy.    He played at the musicale--it was all very informal--and George Sand  pushed her way up through the throng that stood about the piano and  looked at the handsome boy as he played--she looked at him with her big,  hazel, cow eyes, steadfastly, yearningly, and he glancing up, saw the  eyes were filled with tears.    When the playing ceased, she still stood looking at the great musician,  and then she leaned over the piano and whispered, \"Your playing makes me  live over again every pain that has ever wrung my heart; and every joy,  too, that I have ever known is mine again.\"           *       *       *       *       *    After their first meeting, when Chopin played at a musicale, George Sand  was apt to be there too--they often came together. She was five years  older than he, and looked fifteen, for his slight figure and delicate,  boyish face gave him the appearance of youth unto the very last. In  letters to Madame Mariana, George Sand often refers to Chopin as \"My  Little One,\" and when some one spoke of him as \"The Chopinetto,\" the  name seemed to stick.    That she was the man in the partnership is very evident. He really  needed some one to look after him, provide mustard-plasters and run for  the camphor and hot-water bottle. He was the one who did the weeping and  pouting, and had the \"nerves\" and made the scenes; while she, on such  occasions, would viciously roll a cigarette, swear under her breath,  console and pooh-pooh.    Liszt has told us how, on one occasion, she had gone out at night for a  storm-walk, and Chopin, being too ill, or disinclined to go, remained at  home. Upon her return she found him in a conniption, he having composed  a prelude to ward off an attack of cold feet, and was now ready to  scream through fear that something had happened to her. As she entered  the door he arose, staggered and fell before her in a fainting fit.    A whole literature has grown up around the relations of Chopin and  George Sand, and the lady in the case has, herself, set forth her brief  with painstaking detail in her \"Histoire de Ma Vie.\" With De Musset,  George Sand had to reckon on dealing with a writing man, and his  accounts of \"The Little White Blackbird\" had taught her caution.  Thereafter she abjured the litterateurs, excepting when in her old age  she allowed Gustave Flaubert to come within her sacred circle--but her  friendship with Flaubert was placidly platonic, as all the world knows.  And so were her relations with Chopin, provided we accept her version as  gospel fact.    George Sand lacked the frankness of Rousseau; but I think we should be  willing to accept the lady's statements, for she was present and really  the only one in possession of the facts, excepting, of course, Chopin,  and he was not a writer. He could express himself only at the keyboard,  and the piano is no graphophone, for which let us all be duly thankful.  So we are without Chopin's side of the story. We, however, have some  vigorous writing by a man by the name of Hadow.    Mr. Hadow enters the lists panoplied with facts, and declares that the  friendship was strictly platonic, being on the woman's side of a purely  maternal order. Chopin was sick and friendless, and Madame Dudevant,  knowing his worth to the art world, succored him--nursing him as a  Sister of Charity might, sacrificing herself, and even risking her  reputation in order to restore him to life and health.    And this view of the case I am quite willing to accept. Mr. Hadow is no  joker, like that man who has recently written an appreciation of  Xantippe, showing that the wife of Socrates was one of the most patient  women who ever lived, and only at times resorted to heroic means in  order to drive her husband out into the world of thought. She willingly  sacrificed her own good name that another might have literary life.    Hadow has gotten all the facts together and then dispassionately drawn  his conclusions; and these conclusions are eminently"]]]
