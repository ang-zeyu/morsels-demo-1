The same farmer was one day in his cellar when two rats came out of a  hole near him in great haste, and ran up the cellar wall and along its  top till they came to a floor timber that stopped their progress, when  they turned at bay, and looked excitedly back along the course they had  come. In a moment a weasel, evidently in hot pursuit of them, came out  of the hole, but, seeing the farmer, checked his course and darted back.  The rats had doubtless turned to give him fight, and would probably have  been a match for him.    The weasel seems to track its game by scent. A hunter of my acquaintance  was one day sitting in the woods, when he saw a red squirrel run with  great speed up a tree near him, and out upon a long branch, from which  he leaped to some rocks, disappearing beneath them. In a moment a weasel  came in full course upon his trail, ran up the tree, then out along the  branch, leaping from there to the rocks just as the squirrel had done  and pursuing him into their recesses.    Doubtless the squirrel fell a prey to him. The squirrel's best game  would have been to keep to the higher treetops, where he could easily  have distanced the weasel. But beneath the rocks he stood a very poor  chance. I have often wondered what keeps such an animal as the weasel in  check, for they are quite rare. They never need go hungry, for rats and  squirrels and mice and birds are everywhere. They probably do not fall  a prey to any other animal, and they are very rarely captured or killed  by man. But the circumstances or agencies that check the increase of any  species of animal are, as Darwin says, very obscure and but little  known.          IX    THE MINK      In walking through the woods one day in early winter, we read upon the  newly fallen snow the record of a mink's fright the night before. The  mink had been traveling through the woods post-haste, not along the  watercourses where one sees them by day, but over ridges and across  valleys. We followed his track some distance to see what adventures he  had met with. We tracked him through a bushy swamp, and saw where he had  left it to explore a pile of rocks, then where he had taken to the swamp  again, and where he had entered the more open woods. Presently the track  turned sharply about, and doubled upon itself in long hurried strides.  What had caused the mink to change his mind so suddenly? We explored a  few paces ahead, and came upon a fox track. The mink had probably seen  the fox stalking stealthily through the woods, and the sight had  doubtless brought his heart into his mouth. I think he climbed a tree,  and waited till the fox had passed. His track disappeared amid a clump  of hemlocks, and then reappeared again a little beyond them. It  described a big loop around, and then crossed the fox track only a few  yards from the point where its course was interrupted. Then it followed  a little watercourse, went under a rude bridge in a wood-road, then  mingled with squirrel tracks in a denser part of the thicket. If the  mink met a muskrat or a rabbit in his travels, or came upon a grouse, or  quail, or a farmer's henroost, he had the supper he was in quest of.    [Illustration: MINK]    I followed a mink's track one morning upon the snow till I found where  the prowler had overtaken and killed a muskrat by a stone wall near a  little stream. The blood upon the snow and the half-devoured body of the  rat told the whole story. The mink is very fond of muskrats, and  trappers often use this flesh to bait their traps. I wonder if he has  learned to enter the under-water hole to the muskrat's den, and then  seek him in his chamber above, where the poor rat would have little  chance to escape.    The mink is only a larger weasel, and has much of the boldness and  bloodthirstiness of that animal. One summer day my dog Lark and I were  sitting beside a small watercourse in the woods, when I saw a mink  coming up the stream toward us. I sat motionless till the mink was  within a few feet of us, when the dog saw him. As the dog sprang, the  mink darted under a large flat stone. Lark was very fierce, and seemed  to say to me, \"Just lift up that stone and I will show you my way with  minks.\" This I quickly did, and the dog sprang for the game, but he as  quickly withdrew with a cry of pain as if he had touched something  red-hot. The mink had got in the first blow or bite, and then effected  his escape between my feet and the dog's, as if he had vanished in the  air. Where he went to was a mystery. There was no hole; no depth of  water; no hiding-place anywhere that I could discover or that the dog  could discover, and yet the mink had disappeared. It was like some  conjurer's trick.    Minks are fond of fish, and can capture them in the water. This makes  them very destructive along small trout streams and ponds. I once saw a  trout with an ugly gash in its side, which was doubtless the work of a  mink. With a friend, I once had a camp by a trout stream in the  Catskills that we named \"Mink Camp,\" by reason of the number of minks  that came every night as soon as it was dark, to devour the fish-heads  and entrails that we threw over on the opposite bank. We could often  hear them disputing over the spoils, and in the dim light of the  camp-fire could sometimes see them.    You may know the mink's track upon the snow from those of the squirrels  at once. In the squirrel-track the prints of the large hind feet are  ahead, with the prints of the smaller fore feet just behind them, as in  the case of the rabbit. The mink, in running, usually plants his hind  feet exactly upon the track of his fore feet, and closer together than  the squirrel, so that his trail upon the snow is something like this:--    [Illustration]    The squirrel's track, as well as those of the rabbit and the  white-footed mouse, is in form like this:--    [Illustration]    One winter day I had a good view of a mink running upon the snow and ice  along the edge of a stream. He had seen or heard me, and was making a  little extra speed. He bounded along with his back much arched, in a  curiously stiff and mechanical sort of way, with none of the grace and  ease of the squirrel. He leaped high, and cleared about two and a half  feet at a bound.          X    THE RACCOON      In March that brief summary of a bear, the raccoon, comes out of his den  in the ledges, and leaves his sharp digitigrade track upon the  snow,--traveling not unfrequently in pairs,--a lean, hungry couple, bent  on pillage and plunder. They have an unenviable time of it,--feasting in  the summer and fall, hibernating in winter, and starving in spring. In  April I have found the young of the previous year creeping about the  fields, so reduced by starvation as to be quite helpless, and offering  no resistance to my taking them up by the tail and carrying them home.    The old ones also become very much emaciated, and come boldly up to the  barn or other out-buildings in quest of food. I remember, one morning in  early spring, hearing old Cuff, the farm-dog, barking vociferously  before it was yet light. When we got up we discovered him at the foot of  an ash-tree, which stood about thirty rods from the house, looking up at  some gray object in the leafless branches, and by his manners and his  voice evincing great impatience that we were so tardy in coming to his  assistance. Arrived on the spot, we saw in the tree a coon of unusual  size. One bold climber proposed to go up and shake it down. This was  what old Cuff wanted, and he fairly bounded with delight as he saw his  young master shinning up the tree. Approaching within eight or ten feet  of the coon, the climber seized the branch to which it clung and shook  long and fiercely. But the coon was in no danger of losing its hold; and  when the climber paused to renew his hold it turned toward him with a  growl, and showed very clearly a purpose to advance to the attack. This  caused its pursuer to descend to the ground again with all speed. When  the coon was finally brought down with a gun, it fought the dog, which  was a large, powerful animal, with great fury, returning bite for bite  for some moments; and after a quarter of an hour had elapsed, and its  unequal antagonist had shaken it as a terrier does a rat, making his  teeth meet through the small of its back, the coon still showed fight.    The coon is very tenacious of life, and like the badger will always whip  a dog of its own size and weight. A woodchuck can bite severely, having  teeth that cut like chisels, but a coon has agility and power of limb as  well.    Coons are considered game only in the fall, or towards the close of  summer, when they become fat and their flesh sweet. At this time,  cooning is a famous pastime in the remote interior. As these animals are  entirely nocturnal in their habits, they are hunted only at night. A  piece of corn on some remote side-hill near the mountain, or between two  pieces of woods, is most apt to be frequented by them. While the corn is  yet green they pull the ears down like hogs, and, tearing open the  sheathing of husks, eat the tender, succulent kernels, bruising and  destroying much more than they devour. Sometimes their ravages are a  matter of serious concern to the farmer. But every such neighborhood has  its coon-dog, and the boys and young men dearly love the sport. The  party sets out about eight or nine o'clock of a dark, moonless night,  and stealthily approaches the cornfield. The dog knows his business, and  when he is put into a patch of corn and told to \"hunt them up\" he makes  a thorough search, and will not be misled by any other scent. You hear  him rattling through the corn, hither and yon, with great speed. The  coons prick up their ears, and quickly take themselves off on the  opposite side of the field.

It was by the aid of the Dominicans and  Franciscans that Innocent the Third crushed the Albigensian sectaries.  In the sixteenth century the Pontificate exposed to new dangers more  formidable than had ever before threatened it, was saved by a new  religious order, which was animated by intense enthusiasm and organized  with exquisite skill. When the Jesuits came to the rescue of the Papacy,  they found it in extreme peril: but from that moment the tide of battle  turned. Protestantism, which had, during a whole generation, carried all  before it, was stopped in its progress, and rapidly beaten back from  the foot of the Alps to the shores of the Baltic. Before the Order had  existed a hundred years, it had filled the whole world with memorials  of great things done and suffered for the faith. No religious community  could produce a list of men so variously distinguished:--none had  extended its operations over so vast a space; yet in none had there ever  been such perfect unity of feeling and action. There was no region of  the globe, no walk of speculative or of active life, in which Jesuits  were not to be found. They guided the counsels of Kings. They deciphered  Latin inscriptions. They observed the motions of Jupiter's satellites.  They published whole libraries, controversy, casuistry, history,  treatises on optics, Alcaic odes, editions of the fathers, madrigals,  catechisms, and lampoons. The liberal education of youth passed almost  entirely into their hands, and was conducted by them with conspicuous  ability. They appear to have discovered the precise point to which  intellectual culture can be carried without risk of intellectual  emancipation. Enmity itself was compelled to own that, in the art of  managing and forming the tender mind, they had no equals. Meanwhile they  assiduously and successfully cultivated the eloquence of the pulpit.  With still greater assiduity and still greater success they applied  themselves to the ministry of the confessional. Throughout Catholic  Europe the secrets of every government and of almost every family of  note were in their keeping. They glided from one Protestant country  to another under innumerable disguises, as gay Cavaliers, as simple  rustics, as Puritan preachers. They wandered to countries which neither  mercantile avidity nor liberal curiosity had ever impelled any  stranger to explore. They were to be found in the garb of Mandarins,  superintending the observatory at Pekin. They were to be found, spade in  hand, teaching the rudiments of agriculture to the savages of Paraguay.  Yet, whatever might be their residence, whatever might be their  employment, their spirit was the same, entire devotion to the common  cause, implicit obedience to the central authority. None of them had  chosen his dwelling place or his vocation for himself. Whether the  Jesuit should live under the arctic circle or under the equator, whether  he should pass his life in arranging gems and collating manuscripts at  the Vatican or in persuading naked barbarians in the southern hemisphere  not to eat each other, were matters which he left with profound  submission to the decision of others. If he was wanted at Lima, he was  on the Atlantic in the next fleet. If he was wanted at Bagdad, he was  toiling through the desert with the next caravan. If his ministry was  needed in some country where his life was more insecure than that of a  wolf, where it was a crime to harbour him, where the heads and quarters  of his brethren, fixed in the public places, showed him what he had to  expect, he went without remonstrance or hesitation to his doom. Nor  is this heroic spirit yet extinct. When, in our own time, a new and  terrible pestilence passed round the globe, when, in some great cities,  fear had dissolved all the ties which hold society together, when the  secular clergy had deserted their flocks, when medical succour was  not to be purchased by gold, when the strongest natural affections  had yielded to the love of life, even then the Jesuit was found by the  pallet which bishop and curate, physician and nurse, father and mother,  had deserted, bending over infected lips to catch the faint accents of  confession, and holding up to the last, before the expiring penitent,  the image of the expiring Redeemer.    But with the admirable energy, disinterestedness, and self-devotion  which were characteristic of the Society, great vices were mingled. It  was alleged, and not without foundation, that the ardent public spirit  which made the Jesuit regardless of his ease, of his liberty, and of  his life, made him also regardless of truth and of mercy; that no means  which could promote the interest of his religion seemed to him unlawful,  and that by the interest of his religion he too often meant the interest  of his Society. It was alleged that, in the most atrocious plots  recorded in history, his agency could be distinctly traced; that,  constant only in attachment to the fraternity to which he belonged, he  was in some countries the most dangerous enemy of freedom, and in others  the most dangerous enemy of order. The mighty victories which he boasted  that he had achieved in the cause of the Church were, in the judgment of  many illustrious members of that Church, rather apparent than real. He  had indeed laboured with a wonderful show of success to reduce the world  under her laws; but he had done so by relaxing her laws to suit the  temper of the world. Instead of toiling to elevate human nature to the  noble standard fixed by divine precept and example, he had lowered  the standard till it was beneath the average level of human nature. He  gloried in multitudes of converts who had been baptized in the remote  regions of the East: but it was reported that from some of those  converts the facts on which the whole theology of the Gospel depends  had been cunningly concealed, and that others were permitted to avoid  persecution by bowing down before the images of false gods, while  internally repeating Paters and Ayes. Nor was it only in heathen  countries that such arts were said to be practised. It was not strange  that people of alt ranks, and especially of the highest ranks, crowded  to the confessionals in the Jesuit temples; for from those confessionals  none went discontented away. There the priest was all things to all men.  He showed just so much rigour as might not drive those who knelt at his  spiritual tribunal to the Dominican or the Franciscan church. If he had  to deal with a mind truly devout, he spoke in the saintly tones of the  primitive fathers, but with that very large part of mankind who have  religion enough to make them uneasy when they do wrong, and not religion  enough to keep them from doing wrong, he followed a very different  system. Since he could not reclaim them from guilt, it was his business  to save them from remorse. He had at his command an immense dispensary  of anodynes for wounded consciences. In the books of casuistry which had  been written by his brethren, and printed with the approbation of his  superiors, were to be found doctrines consolatory to transgressors of  every class. There the bankrupt was taught how he might, without sin,  secrete his goods from his creditors. The servant was taught how he  might, without sin, run off with his master's plate. The pandar was  assured that a Christian man might innocently earn his living by  carrying letters and messages between married women and their gallants.  The high spirited and punctilious gentlemen of France were gratified by  a decision in favour of duelling. The Italians, accustomed to darker and  baser modes of vengeance, were glad to learn that they might, without  any crime, shoot at their enemies from behind hedges. To deceit was  given a license sufficient to destroy the whole value of human contracts  and of human testimony. In truth, if society continued to hold together,  if life and property enjoyed any security, it was because common sense  and common humanity restrained men from doing what the Society of Jesus  assured them that they might with a safe conscience do.    So strangely were good and evil intermixed in the character of these  celebrated brethren; and the intermixture was the secret of their  gigantic power. That power could never have belonged to mere hypocrites.  It could never have belonged to rigid moralists. It was to be attained  only by men sincerely enthusiastic in the pursuit of a great end, and at  the same time unscrupulous as to the choice of means.    From the first the Jesuits had been bound by a peculiar allegiance to  the Pope. Their mission had been not less to quell all mutiny within the  Church than to repel the hostility of her avowed enemies. Their doctrine  was in the highest degree what has been called on our side of the Alps  Ultramontane, and differed almost as much from the doctrine of Bossuet  as from that of Luther. They condemned the Gallican liberties, the  claim of oecumenical councils to control the Holy See, and the claim of  Bishops to an independent commission from heaven. Lainez, in the name  of the whole fraternity, proclaimed at Trent, amidst the applause of  the creatures of Pius the Fourth, and the murmurs of French and Spanish  prelates, that the government of the faithful had been committed  by Christ to the Pope alone, that in the Pope alone all sacerdotal  authority was concentrated, and that through the Pope alone priests and  bishops derived whatever divine authority they possessed. [56] During  many years the union between the Supreme Pontiffs and the Order had  continued unbroken.
