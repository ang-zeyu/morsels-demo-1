Then, by turning the plane sole upward and glancing down it,  the proper adjustments with the brass set-screw and lateral adjustment  lever are made. When the plane is not being used, it should rest  either on a pillow (a little strip of wood in the bench trough), or on  its side. In no case should it be dropped sole down flat on the bench.    The _block-plane_, Fig. 108, gets its name from the fact that it was  first made for planing off the ends of clap-boards, a process called  \"blocking in\".    [Illustration: Fig. 108. Section of Block-Plane.]    The names of the parts of the Bailey block-plane are[6]:      1. Cutter or bit or _plane-iron_.    2. Clamp or _lever cup_.    3. _Cap-screw_.    4. _Adjusting lever_.    5. _Adjusting nut_.    6. _Lateral adjustment_.    7. _Bottom_.    8. _Mouth piece_.    9. _Eccentric plate_.    10. _Knob_.        [Footnote 6: See footnote p. 70]    The block-plane was devised for use with one hand, as when it is used  by carpenters in planing pieces not readily taken to a vise or in  planing with a bench-hook. Hence it is made small, 3-1/2\" to 8\" long,  the clamp is rounded so as to act as a handle, and the cutter is  lowered to an angle of about 20 deg. to make the plane easy to grasp. The  lower angle of the cutter makes it necessary that the bevel be on the  upper side. Otherwise, to give clearance, the bevel would have to be  made so long and so thin as to be weak. By putting the bevel up, the  angle between the wood and the cutter is maintained practically as in  the smooth-plane. Since the block-plane is intended chiefly for use  on end grain, no cap is needed to break the shavings. The adjustable  throat makes it possible to cut a very fine shaving. To facilitate the  cutting action, several forms of block-planes with a very low angle  are now made.    Where both hands are free to hold the plane, the block-plane has no  advantage over a smooth-plane, even on end grain. Moreover, the cutter  cannot be held so firmly in place as that of a smooth-plane, so that  it requires constant adjustment. Hence it is not an easy tool for  amateurs to handle. There is considerable lost motion in the adjusting  nut, and the set-screw, which acts as a knob, is likely to work loose  and be lost. It is hardly to be recommended as a part of the equipment  of the individual bench in school shops.    The piece to be planed with the block-plane may be held either in  the vise, end up, or on a bench-hook, Fig. 109. In end planing in the  vise, in order to avoid splintering the precaution should be taken to  trim off a corner on the undressed edge, as directed on page 73, or  else the planing must be done from both edges toward the center. The  sliding cut is much easier than the straight cut, and hence there is  a constant temptation to turn the plane at an angle perhaps at an  expense of the flat surface desired.    [Illustration: Fig. 109. Using the Block-Plane and Bench-Hook.]    In using the bench-hook the piece to be block-planed is placed with  the working edge against the block, with the end to be planed to the  right and flush with the edge of the bench-hook, in which position it  is held with the left hand. The block-plane, held in the right hand,  is placed on its side on the bench facing toward the work. In  planing, the left hand holds the work firmly against the block of the  bench-hook, pressing it somewhat to the right against the plane. The  right hand holds the side of the plane flat on the bench and presses  it to the left against the bench-hook and work. Held in this position  the plane is pushed forward and back until the end is smoothed.  Considerable practice is necessary to handle the block-plane well.    The _scrub-plane_ is a short plane in which the crown of the cutter,  Fig. 110, is quite curved. It is used to reduce surfaces rapidly.    The _scratch-plane_, Fig. 111, has a toothed cutter which scratches  fine lines along its course. It is used to roughen surfaces of hard  wood which are to be glued together, for otherwise the glue would not  adhere well. Some tropical woods are so hard that their surfaces can  be reduced only by a scratch-plane. It is also useful in preparing the  surface of a very cross-grained piece of wood which cannot be planed  without chipping. By first scratching it carefully in all directions,  it can then be scraped smooth. It is also called a _scraper-plane_,  because accompanying the plane is a scraper which can be inserted in  the same stock and inclined at any required angle. This plane-stock  prevents the scraper from unduly lowering some portions of the  surface. See also veneer-scraper, p. 91.    [Illustration: Fig. 110. Cutter of Scrub-Plane.]    [Illustration: Fig. 111. Scratch-Plane and Scraper-Plane.]    [Illustration: Fig. 112. Rabbet-Plane.]    [Illustration: Fig. 113. Molding-Plane.]    The _rabbeting-_ or _rebating-plane_, Fig. 112, is designed for use  in cutting out a rectangular recess, such as the rabbet on the back of  the picture-frames. In line with the right hand corner of the cutter  is a removable spur to score the wood so that the shaving which  follows may be cut out clean and not torn out. With the addition of a  guiding fence it is called a _filletster_. This may be used on either  the right or left side. In the form shown in Fig. 112, there is also a  depth gage.    In using this plane see that the corner of the cutter is in line with  the sole, and that both it and the spur are sharp. Set the fence and  the stop at the desired width and depth of the rabbet. At the first  stroke the spur will score the width. This and every stroke should  be taken as evenly and carefully as if it were the only one. In the  effort to keep the fence pressed close to the side of the wood, the  tendency is to tilt the plane over. This causes the very opposite  effect from that desired, for the spur runs off diagonally, as in Fig.  114.    [Illustration: Fig. 114. Result of Careless use of Rabbet-Plane.]    If this happens stop planing at once, clean out the recess properly  with a chisel and then proceed.    The _dado-plane_ is much like the rabbeting-plane, except that it  is provided with two spurs, one at each side of the cutting edge, to  score the wood before cutting.    The _molding-plane_, Fig. 113, as it name indicates, is for making  moldings of various forms; as, quarter-round, half-round, ogee, etc.    [Illustration: Fig. 115. Tonguing-and-Grooving Plane.]    The _tonguing-and-grooving-plane_, Fig. 115, is for matching boards,  i.e. making a tongue in one to fit into a groove in another. See Fig.  269, No. 72, p. 182.    The _circular-plane_, Fig. 116, has a flexible steel face which can  be adjusted to any required arc, convex or concave, so that curved  surfaces may be planed.    [Illustration: Fig. 116. Circular-Plane.]    The _universal plane_, Fig. 117, is a combination of various molding-,  rabbeting-, matching- and other planes. It is capable of many  adjustments and applications. The principal parts of this plane are:  a _main stock_, _A_, with two sets of transverse sliding arms, a  _depth-gage_, _F_, adjusted by a screw, and a _slitting cutter_ with  stop, a _sliding section_, _B_, with a vertically adjustable bottom,  the _auxiliary center bottom_, _C_, to be placed when needed in front  of the cutter as an extra support or stop. This bottom is adjustable  both vertically and laterally. _Fences_, _D and E_. For fine work,  fence _D_ has a lateral adjustment by means of a thumb-screw. The  fences can be used on either side of the plane, and the rosewood  guides can be tilted to any desired angle up to 45 deg., by loosening the  screws on the face. Fence _E_ can be reversed for center-beading wide  boards. For work thinner than the depth of the fence, the work  may overhang the edge of the bench and fence _E_ be removed. An  _adjustable stop_, to be used in beading the edges of matched boards,  is inserted on the left side of the sliding section _B_. A great  variety of cutters are supplied, such as: molding, matching,  sash, beading, reeding, fluting, hollow, round, plow, rabbet, and  filletster. Special shapes can be obtained by order.    [Illustration: Fig. 117. Universal Plane.]    _The Use of the Universal Plane._ Insert the proper cutter, adjusting  it so that the portion of it in line with the main stock, _A_, will  project below the sole the proper distance for cutting.    Adjust the bottom of the sliding section, _B_, so that the lowest  portion of the cutter will project the proper distance below it for  cutting. Tighten the check nuts on the transverse arms and _then_  tighten the thumb-screws which secure the sliding section to the arms.  The sliding section is not always necessary, as in a narrow rabbet or  bead.    When an additional support is needed for the cutter, the auxiliary  center bottom, _C_, may be adjusted in front of it. This may also be  used as a stop.    [Illustration: Fig. 118. Iron Spokeshave.]    [Illustration: Fig. 119. Pattern-maker's Spokeshave.]    Adjust one or both of the fences, _D_ and _E_, and fasten with the  thumb-screws. Adjust the depth-gage, _F_, at the proper depth.    For a _dado_ remove the fences and set the spurs parallel with the  edges of the cutter. Insert the long adjustable stop on the left hand  of the sliding section. For slitting, insert the cutter and stop on  the right side of the main stock and use either fence for a guide.    For a _chamfer_, insert the desired cutter, and tilt the rosewood  guides on the fences to the required angle. For _chamfer beading_ use  in the same manner, and gradually feed the cutter down by means of the  adjusting thumb-nut.    There are also a number of planelike tools such as the following:    The _spoke-shave_, Fig. 118, works on the same principle as a plane,  except that the guiding surface is very short. This adapts it to work  with curved outlines. It is a sort of regulated draw-shave. It is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20847"],[0,"India: What can it teach us?

My interest lies  altogether with the people of India, _when left to themselves_, and  historically I should like to draw a line after the year one thousand  after Christ. When you read the atrocities committed by the Mohammedan  conquerors of India from that time to the time when England stepped in  and, whatever may be said by her envious critics, made, at all events,  the broad principles of our common humanity respected once more in  India, the wonder, to my mind, is how any nation could have survived  such an _Inferno_ without being turned into devils themselves.    Now, it is quite true that during the two thousand years which precede  the time of Mahmud of Gazni, India has had but few foreign visitors,  and few foreign critics; still it is surely extremely strange that  whenever, either in Greek, or in Chinese, or in Persian, or in Arab  writings, we meet with any attempts at describing the distinguishing  features in the national character of the Indians, regard for truth  and justice should always be mentioned first.    _Ktesias_, the famous Greek physician of Artaxerxes Mnemon (present at  the battle of Cunaxa, 404 B.C.), the first Greek writer who tells us  anything about the character of the Indians, such as he heard it  described at the Persian court, has a special chapter \"On the Justice  of the Indians.\"[39]    _Megasthenes_,[40] the ambassador of Seleucus Nicator at the court of  Sandrocottus in Palibothra (Pa_t_aliputra, the modern Patna), states  that thefts were extremely rare, and that they honored truth and  virtue.[41]    _Arrian_ (in the second century, the pupil of Epictetus), when  speaking of the public overseers or superintendents in India,  says:[42] \"They oversee what goes on in the country or towns, and  report everything to the king, where the people have a king, and to  the magistrates, where the people are self-governed, and it is against  use and wont for these to give in a false report; _but indeed no  Indian is accused of lying_.\"[43]    The Chinese, who come next in order of time, bear the same, I believe,  unanimous testimony in favor of the honesty and veracity of the  Hindus. [The earliest witness is Su-we, a relative of Fan-chen, King  of Siam, who between 222 and 227 A.D. sailed round the whole of India,  till he reached the mouth of the Indus, and then explored the country.  After his return to Sinto, he received four Yueh-chi horses, sent by a  king of India as a present to the King of Siam and his ambassador. At  the time when these horses arrived in Siam (it took them four years to  travel there), there was staying at the court of Siam an ambassador of  the Emperor of China, Khang-thai, and this is the account which he  received of the kingdom of India: \"It is a kingdom in which the  religion of Buddha flourishes. The inhabitants are straightforward and  honest, and the soil is very fertile. The king is called Meu-lun, and  his capital is surrounded by walls,\" etc. This was in about 231 A.D.  In 605 we hear again of the Emperor Yang-ti sending an ambassador,  Fei-tu, to India, and this is what among other things he points out as  peculiar to the Hindus: \"They believe in solemn oaths.\"][44] Let me  quote Hiouen-thsang, the most famous of the Chinese Buddhist  pilgrims, who visited India in the seventh century.[45] \"Though the  Indians,\" he writes, \"are of a light temperament, they are  distinguished by the straightforwardness and honesty of their  character. With regard to riches, they never take anything unjustly;  with regard to justice, they make even excessive concessions....  Straightforwardness is the distinguishing feature of their  administration.\"    If we turn to the accounts given by the Mohammedan conquerors of  India, we find Idrisi, in his Geography (written in the eleventh  century), summing up their opinion of the Indians in the following  words:[46]        \"The Indians are naturally inclined to justice, and never      depart from it in their actions. Their good faith, honesty,      and fidelity to their engagements are well known, and they      are so famous for these qualities that people flock to their      country from every side.\"    Again, in the thirteenth century, Shems-ed-din Abu Abdallah quotes the  following judgment of Bedi ezr Zenan: \"The Indians are innumerable,  like grains of sand, free from all deceit and violence. They fear  neither death nor life.\"[47]    In the thirteenth century we have the testimony of Marco Polo,[48]who  thus speaks of the _Abraiaman_, a name by which he seems to mean the  Brahmans who, though, not traders by profession, might well have been  employed for great commercial transactions by the king. This was  particularly the case during times which the Brahmans would call  times of distress, when many things were allowed which at other times  were forbidden by the laws. \"You must know,\" Marco Polo says, \"that  these Abraiaman are the best merchants in the world, and the most  truthful, for they would not tell a lie for anything on earth.\"    In the fourteenth century we have Friar Jordanus, who goes out of his  way to tell us that the people of Lesser India (South and Western  India) are true in speech and eminent in justice.[49]    In the fifteenth century, Kamal-eddin Abd-errazak Samarkandi  (1413-1482), who went as ambassador of the Khakan to the prince of  Kalikut and to the King of Vidyanagara (about 1440-1445), bears  testimony to the perfect security which merchants enjoy in that  country.[50]    In the sixteenth century, Abu Fazl, the minister of the Emperor Akbar,  says in his Ayin Akbari: \"The Hindus are religious, affable, cheerful,  lovers of justice, given to retirement, able in business, admirers of  truth, grateful and of unbounded fidelity; and their soldiers know not  what it is to fly from the field of battle.\"[51]    And even in quite modern times the Mohammedans seem willing to admit  that the Hindus, at all events in their dealings with Hindus, are more  straightforward than Mohammedans in their dealings with Mohammedans.    Thus Meer Sulamut Ali, a venerable old Mussulman, and, as Colonel  Sleeman says, a most valuable public servant, was obliged to admit  that \"a Hindu may feel himself authorized to take in a Mussulman, and  might even think it meritorious to do so; but he would never think it  meritorious to take in one of his own religion. There are no less than  seventy-two sects of Mohammedans; and every one of these sects would  not only take in the followers of every other religion on earth, but  every member of every one of the other seventy-one sects; and the  nearer that sect is to his own, the greater the merit of taking in its  members.\"[52]    So I could go on quoting from book after book, and again and again we  should see how it was love of truth that struck all the people who  came in contact with India, as the prominent feature in the national  character of its inhabitants. No one ever accused them of falsehood.  There must surely be some ground for this, for it is not a remark that  is frequently made by travellers in foreign countries, even in our  time, that their inhabitants invariably speak the truth. Read the  accounts of English travellers in France, and you will find very  little said about French honesty and veracity, while French accounts  of England are seldom without a fling at _Perfide Albion_!    But if all this is true, how is it, you may well ask, that public  opinion in England is so decidedly unfriendly to the people of India;  at the utmost tolerates and patronizes them, but will never trust  them, never treat them on terms of equality?    I have already hinted at some of the reasons. Public opinion with  regard to India is made up in England chiefly by those who have spent  their lives in Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, or some other of the  principal towns in India. The native element in such towns contains  mostly the most unfavorable specimens of the Indian population. An  insight into the domestic life of the more respectable classes, even  in towns, is difficult to obtain; and, when it is obtained, it is  extremely difficult to judge of their manners according to our  standard of what is proper, respectable, or gentlemanlike. The  misunderstandings are frequent and often most grotesque; and such, we  must confess, is human nature, that when we hear the different and  often most conflicting accounts of the character of the Hindus, we are  naturally skeptical with regard to unsuspected virtues among them,  while we are quite disposed to accept unfavorable accounts of their  character.    Lest I should seem to be pleading too much on the native side of the  question, and to exaggerate the difficulty of forming a correct estimate  of the character of the Hindus, let me appeal to one of the most  distinguished, learned, and judicious members of the Indian Civil  Service, the author of the \"History of India,\" Mountstuart Elphinstone.  \"Englishmen in India,\"[53] he says, \"have less opportunity than might be  expected of forming opinions of the native character. Even in England,  few know much of the people beyond their own class, and what they do  know, they learn from newspapers and publications of a description which  does not exist in India. In that"]]]
