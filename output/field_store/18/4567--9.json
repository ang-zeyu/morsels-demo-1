[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20346"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Winchester (#12)"],[1,"of Edward the Confessor,\" by S. Aelred, Cistercian Abbot  of Rievaulx about 1160, containing a portrait of the king within one of  its initial letters; a copy of the \"_Promptorium Parvulorum_\"; a charter  of AEthelwulf, King of Wessex, dated 854 and bearing the signatures of  the king, his young son Alfred, and S. Swithun. There are also the  chapter-books for 1553-1600; the cathedral statutes, with the signatures  of Charles I. and Bishop Laud; the original charter of Henry VIII. to  the cathedral, on the dissolution of the priory; and many interesting  documents and printed books, some with the original chains which were  fastened to their covers. Here also are kept the great seal of Henry V.,  the pastoral staff from Bishop Fox's tomb, his ring, those of Bishops  Gardiner and Woodlock, and the one, set with a sapphire, which comes  from the tomb of \"William Rufus\"--probably, as we have said, belonging  to Henry of Blois. The library was built in 1668 A.D.       [4] It is now, however, on record that the book was bequeathed by         Bishop Nicholas of Ely in 1282.    We may now return to the body of the cathedral and pass to the  surroundings of the choir.    The #Feretory#, where the _feretra_ or shrines of the saints were  placed, lies behind the high altar and reredos, and the two doors in the  latter give access to it. At one time, before the erection of the  reredos, the feretory must have been visible from the choir. Behind the  doors is a raised platform, seven feet in breadth, extending right  across. The upper surface of this is now only three feet above the  ground level, but originally it must have been far higher. Four steps  give access to it. Before it is a hollow space with stumps of piers,  demonstrating the ancient presence of an arcade in front of the  platform. The feretory is without internal decoration, but the exterior  of the east wall is adorned with nine rich Decorated tabernacles, with  the yet legible names of saints and king who once occupied the eighteen  pedestals within them. This inscription is to be found here:--        _Corpora sanctorum sunt hic in pace sepulta,       Ex meritis quorum fulgent miracula multa_.    The floor beneath the platform is supported by a small vault, \"the  entrance to which (to quote Willis) is by a low arch in the eastern face  of the wall under the range of tabernacles.\" This vault is that which  was designated as the _Sanctum Sanctorum_ or #Holy Hole#. The feretory  is used as a receptacle for the carved work found at various dates about  the cathedral, including portions of statuary once belonging to the  great screen. Here lies a really marvellous lid of a reliquary chest,  presented in 1309 by Sir William de Lilburn, with events in the life of  our Lord and various saints vividly portrayed in colours, and decorated  with the donor's armorial bearings. The \"Holy Hole\" has been used as a  receptacle for fragments of various kinds since the end of the fifteenth  century, before which it was visible from the choir, for no reredos  intercepted the view. Milner states that in 1789 the whole passage and  vault was so choked with rubbish that the attempt to enter it had to be  abandoned. A more recent observer records that there appears to be no  space for a crypt or receptacle for relics within the \"Holy Hole,\" the  chest of bones, etc., being placed on the platform over the arcade. The  fragments now in the feretory are often very fine, but are most of them  sadly mutilated.    [Illustration: BACK OF FERETORY, WITH BISHOP GARDINER'S CHANTRY  _S.B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]    The north and south sides of the feretory are flanked by the chantries  of Bishops Gardiner and Fox, into which it opens. #Gardiner's Chantry#,  in the Renaissance style, was much damaged by the Reformers, the head  being knocked off the figure lying in a long niche on the outside of the  chantry, and other indignities committed. Of the tomb nothing now  remains, but there is an altar with figures at the back, after Italian  models, representing, according to one tradition, Justice and Mercy,  while others say the Law and the Gospel. At the east end is a small  vestry used as a repository for fragments. The details and the mouldings  of Gardiner's chantry are of the Renaissance style, and Britton has  described the chapel as \"bad Italian and bad English.\" This is true of  the eastern end of the compartment, but there are redeeming features  amid the curious mixture of styles. Below the floor-level of this  chantry may be seen the base of one of the Norman apse piers, the sole  remaining feature of the Norman east end except the crypt.    #Bishop Fox's Chantry# is a far finer piece of work and is certainly the  most elaborate chantry in the cathedral. It displays no fewer than  fifty-five richly-groined niches, all different in pattern; only two of  them are tenanted, and these by very recent figures, on either side of  the door. There is a great amount of wonderful undercutting to be seen  in the spandrels to the arches, and the upper part of the erection shows  open tracery with niches and canopies, under a cornice of running  foliage and Tudor flowers, surmounted by panelled pinnacles. Fox's  \"pelican in her piety\" alternates on the pinnacles with small octagonal  turrets. At one time, moreover, all the arches, etc., contained stained  glass, but this has now vanished. Within there is no tomb, but, as in  Gardiner's chantry, there is, in an arched recess at the side, the  ghastly carved figure of a corpse so frequently introduced in monuments  of the period. The altar is surmounted by a small reredos in a sunk  panel, now unoccupied, crowned by a band of angels bearing emblems of  the Passion. Over the altar is this inscription in Latin:--      _O sacrum convivium in quo Christus sumitur._    There is here, as was the case with Gardiner's chantry, a small room at  the eastern end. In this are chests in which relics were kept.    [Illustration: BISHOP FOX'S CHANTRY.]    The interior part of the choir aisles have received \"Wykeham\" windows,  four on each side, though from the exterior only three can be seen. The  westernmost on the north side has two lights partly looking into the  open, while two are unglazed and the top of one looks into the northern  transept. On the south side all are glazed, but only three get any light  from outside. These can be seen from the close at the junction of  transept and retro-choir. All these windows have blank panelling or  arcading below. It looks as if Wykeham or his successors meant to reduce  the width of the Norman transepts, so as to bring them into better  proportion with the eastern arm of the church.    [Illustration: DOOR OF FOX'S CHANTRY.]    Between the presbytery and the side aisles, extending from pier to pier,  are screens of pierced stonework, erected by Bishop Fox, whose motto  frequently occurs on them, together with his initials and Cardinal  Beaufort's. On the top of the screens are six painted chests (see p.  95), in which are collected the bones of saints and kings of the Saxon  period; the original collection being made by Henry of Blois. These  #Mortuary Chests# were desecrated by the Cromwellian ruffians when they  broke into the cathedral, and the bones were hurled through the stained  glass of the west and other windows. Afterwards they were collected once  more and replaced in the chests where they now lie. Among the relics are  the bones of Edred, Edmund, Canute, William Rufus, Emma, Bishops Wina,  Alwyn, Egbert, Cenwulf or Kenulf, Cynegils, and Ethelwulf, and there are  the old inscriptions to indicate whose remains were originally enclosed  within the boxes, though there is now no warrant that the bones within  correspond at all to the names without.    [Illustration: DETAIL OF PULPIT.]    Among those who have been buried in the presbytery aisles is Bishop de  Pontissara, of whom Rudborne says that he was buried _ex aquilonari  plaga majoris altaris_. Accordingly we find his monument on the north  side. Close by him, and still nearer the altar, was laid Hardicanute,  the last Danish king, who was brought hither from Lambeth for interment.  His death was attributed to \"excessive drinking.\" In the southern aisle  are Richard, the Conqueror's younger son; Edward, eldest born of Alfred  the Great; and Bishop Nicholas de Ely's heart.    [Illustration: SOUTH AISLE OF RETRO-CHOIR, WITH BEAUFORT'S AND FOX'S  CHANTRIES. _S.B. Bolas & Co., Photo._]    Eastward of the feretory the building is known by the name of the  #Retro-choir#, and presents a very old and pure example of Early English  work from the hands of Bishop de Lucy. The aisles are said to have been  used as a model in the building of Salisbury Cathedral. Similar  processional aisles may be seen also at Hereford on a minor scale. This  part of the cathedral is lower and consequently appears broader than the  more westerly portion. There is a considerable amount of wall-space,  only interrupted by the numerous imposing chantries erected on the  floor. The lower part of the walls is remarkable for some fine, though  simple, blank arcading, dating also from De Lucy's time; while light is  given by pairs of lancet windows, the rear arches being borne on groups  of detached shafts. Many of the original chased tiles of the pavement  remain to this day, and, in fact, there has been little interference  with De Lucy's work. Unfortunately, however, as has been remarked, much  of it has settled considerably, throwing the south-eastern angle  altogether out of the perpendicular, one vaulting-shaft having in this  manner been bent back and cracked in half. The effects of the subsidence  can easily be seen in the photograph of the south aisle of the  retro-choir looking toward the east.    As one passes beyond the feretory through the retro-choir, the #Chantry  of William Waynflete# stands to the north of the central alley. The  canopy is very elaborate and beautiful, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20348"],[0,"The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays (#12)"],[1,"about the farmhouse, arranging the plans.    One afternoon Alice was sitting on the porch with Estelle, waiting  until it was time for them to take their parts in a side scene of the  production. A nattily attired young officer came up the walk, doffing  his cap.    \"I beg your pardon,\" he said. \"I am Lieutenant Varley, and I was sent  here to ask for Mr. Pertell. Perhaps you can tell me where I can find  him?\"    Alice looked and blushed. He was the one who had audaciously waved to  her beneath her window, but now he showed no sign of recognition. As his  gaze rested on the face of Estelle Brown, however, he started.    \"Excuse me!\" he began, \"but did you reach your destination safely?\"    \"My destination!\" exclaimed Estelle. \"What do you mean? I don't know  you!\"    \"Perhaps not by name. But are you not the young lady whom I met some  years ago in Portland, Oregon, inquiring how to get to New York?\"    \"You are mistaken,\" said Estelle, and her voice was frigid in tone. \"I  have never been in Portland in my life,\" and she turned aside.          CHAPTER XI    WONDERINGS      For a moment Lieutenant Varley seemed to hesitate, and Alice felt sorry  for him. He was distinctly not of the type that would try to make an  acquaintance in this way just because Estelle was a pretty girl. He  seemed embarrassed and ill at ease. But he was not the sort of young man  to give up, once he thought he was right, as he obviously did in this  case. To do so, Alice felt sure he reasoned, would have been to  acknowledge that he was just the sort he seemingly was not.    \"I really beg your pardon,\" he went on, in a firm but respectful tone.  \"I am sure I have met you before. I do not wonder that you do not  remember me, but I cannot forget you. Yours isn't a face one easily  forgets,\" and he smiled genially, and in a manner to disarm criticism.    \"But I never was in Portland,\" insisted Estelle, and it was plain that  she was puzzled by his persistence but not offended by it. \"And I don't  remember ever having seen you before.\"    \"Perhaps if I recall some of the circumstances to you it may bring back  the memory,\" suggested the lieutenant. \"Believe me, I do not do it out  of mere idle curiosity, but you seemed in such distress at the time, and  so uncertain of where you wanted to go, that I really wished after I had  directed you that I had placed you in charge of the conductor of your  train.\"    \"But I never was in Portland,\" said Estelle again, \"and though I have  been in New York, I went there from Boston. Surely you have confused me  with some one else.\"    The young officer shook his head.    \"I couldn't do that,\" he said with a smile that showed his white, even  teeth. \"It was just about this time three--no, four years ago. I was in  Portland on business, and as I entered the railroad station you were  standing there----\"    Estelle shook her head, smiling.    \"Well, for the sake of argument,\" admitted the lieutenant, \"say it was  some one who looked like you.\"    \"All right,\" agreed Miss Brown, and she and Alice drew near the porch  railing, on the other side of which stood the officer with doffed hat.    \"A young lady was standing there, and she seemed quite bewildered,\" went  on Lieutenant Varley. \"I saw that she was in some confusion, and asked  if I could be of any service to her. She said she wanted to get to New  York, but did not know which train to take. I asked her if she had her  ticket, and she replied in the negative. I asked her if she wanted to  buy one, and she said she did, showing a purse well filled with  bills----\"    \"Then surely it could not have been I!\" exclaimed Estelle with a merry  laugh. \"I never had a purse well-filled with bills. We moving picture  players--at least in my class--don't go about like millionaires.  Gracious! I only wish I did have a well-filled purse, don't you, Alice?\"    \"Surely. But what else happened? I'm interested in the story.\"    \"And I was interested in the young lady,\" went on the officer. \"I bought  her ticket for her with the money she handed me, and put her on the  train. She was quite young--about as old as you\"--and he smiled at  Estelle, \"and I asked her if some one was going to meet her. She said  she thought so, but was not sure, at any rate she felt that she could  look after herself. I left her, and meant to speak to the conductor  about her, but did not have time.    \"I have often wondered since whether she arrived safely, and when I saw  you sitting here I felt that I could ascertain. For I certainly took you  for that young lady.\"    \"I am sorry to spoil your romance,\" said Estelle, \"but I am not the one.  I never was farther West than Chicago, and then only for a little while,  filling a short engagement in the movies.\"    \"Well, I won't insist on your identity,\" said the lieutenant, \"but I'm  sure I'm not mistaken. However, I won't trouble you further----\"    \"Oh, it has been no trouble,\" interrupted Estelle. \"I'm sure I hope you  will find that young lady some day.\"    \"I hope so, too,\" and the lieutenant bowed. But, judging from his face,  Alice thought, it was plain that he was sure he had already found the  young lady in question.    At that moment Mr. Pertell came out on the porch and saw the lieutenant.    \"Ah, I'm glad you are here,\" observed the manager. \"I want to ask you a  great many things. This staging of sham battles is not as easy as I  thought it would be.\"    \"We can have the sham battles all right,\" answered the officer, with a  smile. \"But I can imagine it is not easy to get good moving pictures of  them. We have to operate over a large area, and we can't always tell  what the next move will be. Though, of course, for the purpose of making  views we can ignore military regulations and strain a point or two.\"    \"That's just what I want to talk about,\" remarked Mr. Pertell. \"In the  attack, for instance, the way the plans have been made the sun is wrong  for getting good views. Can't we switch the two armies around?\"    \"Well, I suppose we can. I'll speak to the colonel about it,\" and then  the two went inside, where Mr. Pertell had his office in the parlor of  the farmhouse.    \"What do you think of him, Estelle?\" asked Alice.    \"Why, I think he's very nice, but he's altogether wrong about me.\"    \"And yet he seemed so positive.\"    \"Yes, that is what makes it strange. But I never saw him before--that  is, as far as I know; and I'm certain I was never in Portland. He must  be mistaken, but it was nice of him to admit it. I thought at first he  was using the old method to get acquainted.\"    \"So did I. But he isn't that kind.\"    \"He doesn't seem to be.\"    Russ Dalwood came around the corner of the porch with Paul Ardite and  Hal Watson, a young man lately engaged to play juvenile roles. Hal had  become very friendly with the little group that circled around Ruth and  Alice.    \"You girls have an hour yet before you go on,\" Russ informed them. \"We  haven't anything to do until then, either. Want to take a run in to  town? I've got to call at the express office for some extra film, and  the auto is ready. Where's Ruth?\"    \"Up in her room. I'll go for her,\" offered Alice. \"Shall we have time?\"    \"Plenty. You can even buy yourself some candy--or let us do it for you,\"  laughed Paul.    \"We'll let you do it!\" said Estelle, as Alice hastened to summon her  sister.    \"Ruth! Ruth! where are you?\" called Alice, as she ran upstairs--Alice  seldom walked.    \"Here, just reading over my new part. What's the matter?\"    \"We're going for an auto ride with the boys. Come along. You can study  in the car.\"    \"Yes, a lot of studying I could do under those circumstances. But I'll  come--I want a bit of diversion. Who else is going?\"    Alice told her, and then spoke about the young lieutenant.    \"Wasn't it queer he should be mistaken?\" she asked.    Ruth did not reply for a moment.    \"Wasn't it?\" repeated her sister.    \"I was just wondering,\" said Ruth, slowly. \"Was it?\"          CHAPTER XII    AN INTERRUPTION      While Alice was putting on her hat Ruth looked at her in some surprise.    \"Was it?\" she repeated.    \"Was what?\" asked her sister.    \"Was it a mistake?\"    \"Of course it was, Ruth! Didn't I tell you Estelle said he must have  taken her for some one else, as she had never been in Portland in her  life? Of course, it was a mistake. What makes you think it wasn't?\"    \"Because, Alice, I am beginning to have doubts regarding Estelle.\"    \"Doubts! You don't mean about the ring?\"    \"Of course not! But I am beginning to think she is not altogether what  she seems to be.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Well, nothing serious, of course. And if she has done what I think she  has it isn't any worse than many girls have done, and have gained by it,  rather than lost, though it was risky.\"    \"You mean?\"    \"I mean that I believe she isn't telling us all she knows. She is hiding  something about her past. And I believe it is that she has run away from  home because her family would not let her go into moving pictures. You  know we sort of suspected that before. Now, in that case, she would have  every reason to deny that she had seen that young lieutenant in  Portland.\"    \"Why should she, providing I grant that you are right?\"    \"Because he might know her friends and would tell them where she was.  And she doesn't want that known until she has made a reputation. I don't  blame her. If ever I ran away----\"    \"Ruth! _you_ are not thinking of it, are you?\"    \"Silly! Of course not. But if I should I wouldn't want to run back home  until I had something to show for my efforts. It may be that way in  Estelle's case. She doesn't want to return like the prodigal son.\"    \"I believe you're entirely wrong,\" declared Alice. \"What I think is that  she perhaps comes of good people. When I say that I don't mean that they  were any better than we are, but that they so regarded themselves, and  would look askance at motion picture players. Well,"]]]
