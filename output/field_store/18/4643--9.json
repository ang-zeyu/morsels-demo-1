CHAPTER ELEVEN    THE DISORDERS OF PREGNANCY     Smooth Course of Pregnancy in Some Women--Pregnancy and    Parturition May be Made Normal Processes Through Education in    True Hygiene--Morning Sickness and Its Treatment--Necessity for    Medical Advice in Pernicious Vomiting--Anorexia--Bulimia--Aversion    Towards Certain Foods--Peculiar Cravings--Tendency to Constipation    Aggravated by Pregnancy--Dietary Measures in Constipation--Rectal    Injections in Constipation--Laxatives--Cause of Frequent Desire to    Urinate During First Two or Three and Last Months of Pregnancy--    Treatment of Frequent Urination--Cause of Piles During Pregnancy    and Their Treatment--Cause of Itching of External Genitals During    Pregnancy and Treatment--Cause of Varicose Veins and Treatment--    Liver Spots.      We saw that in some women menstruation runs a perfectly smooth course,  free from any disagreeable symptoms. The same is true of pregnancy. It  is remarkable how smooth and easy the entire course is with some  women. Many women know that they are pregnant only because of the  non-appearance of the monthly periods; and even in the later months  they feel no discomfort, attending to all their work and pleasures as  usual; and even childbirth is a trifling matter with them.  Unfortunately the number of such women is not very large, and,  because of our confined, unnatural, often exhausting way of living,  is becoming smaller and smaller. There is no question that the  civilized, refined woman has a harder ordeal in pregnancy and  childbirth than has her primitive sister. We confidently hope that  this will not be so in the future; we expect the time to come when  true hygiene will be an integral part of the education and the life of  every girl, and then pregnancy and parturition may become even easier  processes than they are in the primitive races. But the time is not  yet; and in the meantime our young women have a good deal to go  through.    =Morning Sickness.= One of the commonest disorders of pregnancy is the  so-called morning sickness. This consists in a feeling of nausea and  vomiting, which comes on soon after getting up. The morning sickness  makes its first appearance in the third, fourth or fifth week of  pregnancy and lasts usually until the end of the third or fourth  month. In some women, however, the morning sickness comes on in a few  days after impregnation has taken place, and those women diagnose  their condition unmistakably by the feeling of slight nausea which  they experience on getting up. Medicines are as a rule of little use  in treating morning sickness. The \"disease\" can be relieved but not  cured. The patient should stay in bed later than usual, should have  her breakfast in bed, and then not get up for about half an hour  afterward. If the patient is anemic, a good iron preparation may prove  useful.    =Pernicious Vomiting.= The vomiting of pregnancy sometimes becomes so  severe and uncontrollable that it has been given the name pernicious.  The patient is unable to retain any kind of food, not even liquids,  vomits almost incessantly, and may become very much run down and  exhausted. The vomited matter may contain blood. For this condition a  competent physician must be consulted, for in some cases the patient's  life may be in danger and an abortion has to be performed.    =Capricious Appetite.= A capricious appetite is very common in  pregnancy. The capriciousness may express itself in four different  directions: (1) The patient may lose her appetite, almost"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21880"],[0,"The Medallic History of the United States of America 1776-1876 (#12)"],[1,".
