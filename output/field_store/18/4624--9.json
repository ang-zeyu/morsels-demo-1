[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21312"],[0,"Glyn Severn's Schooldays (#12)"],[1,"by a big tom-cat which passed  most of its time in the pantry rubbing its head against Wrench's legs  while he was cleaning the plate or washing tea-cups, probably in  gratitude for past favours.  When it was a kitten some young Plymborough  roughs had hurled it into the little river, and were making of it what  they termed a \"cockshy,\" pelting it with stones, fortunately  ineffectually, and trying to beat it under water, when the Doctor's  footman, who was crossing the bridge, saw what was going on and made an  unexpected charge upon the young ruffians, effectually scattering them.  One tripped and fell headlong into the river, out of which he crawled as  thoroughly wet as the unhappy little kitten, which Wrench received as it  swam ashore, rolled up in his handkerchief and took home to his pantry,  where it grew rapidly, waxed fat, and was never so happy as when it  could find a chance to rub its head against its master.    Hard on Wrench's heels came also one Sam Grigg, page-boy, who on  particular occasions wore a livery jacket with three rows of plated  pill-like buttons, but who was now in the fatigue-dress of rolled-up  shirt sleeves and a very dirty apron, while his left-hand was occupied  by a boot, the right by a blacking-brush, which seemed to have been  applied several times to an itching nose, his chin, and one side of his  face, rather accounting for the plural nickname given him by the boys of  \"Day & Martin.\"    These had come out to join in the ovation, Wrench adding several proud  encomiums, one of which was, \"My eyes, gentlemen!  You did do it fine!\"    The Doctor's footman had hardly uttered these words when there was the  loud ringing of a bell.    \"The Doctor!\" he ejaculated, and he hurried into the house, his exit  from the playground being followed by a fresh burst of cheering and a  peculiar triumphant dance on the part of the page, accompanied by the  waving of boot and blacking-brush, till, in his disgust, Slegge made a  rush at him from behind, grabbed him by the scruff of the neck, and ran  him rapidly to the boot-house, sent him flying in with a savage kick,  and banged the door after him.    \"A blackguard!\" he cried haughtily.  \"That's why our boots are not half  cleaned.  How dare he!  The dirty, contemptible scrub!  The Doctor ought  to be told of this.\"    Slegge stood sniffing and snorting and glaring round fiercely at the  worshippers of the two heroes of the hour, who stood flushed and  worried, ready to beat a retreat to the dormitory.    But an end was put to their reception in a very unexpected way, for  Wrench suddenly made his appearance, looking very solemn as he hurried  off to the two lads with, \"The Doctor wants to see you both, sirs,  directly, in the study.\"    Slegge's face lit up with a malicious grin.    \"Haw, haw!\" he laughed.  \"Three cheers, boys!  The Doctor wants to see  them both in his study.  Impositions!  Hooray!  Cheer, you little  beggars!  Why don't you cheer?\"    The adjuration fell flat, for not a boy uttered a sound, save one who  exclaimed, \"Oh, what a shame!\" and then went off to the cricket-field,  trying hard, poor little fellow! to suppress the natural desire to cry  out and sob, for Slegge had \"fetched him,\" as he termed it, a sounding  slap upon the cheek, which echoed in the silence and cut the boy's lips  against a sharp white tooth.    \"What's the Doctor want?\" whispered Singh, as they followed the footman  into the house.    \"A wigging, I'm afraid, gentlemen,\" said the man who heard his words.  \"But don't you mind.  You write out your lines and do your imposition  like men.  It was fine!  What you did this morning has made every one  think no end of you, and it will never be forgotten so long as this  'ere's a school.\"    A tap of the knuckles, which sounded hollow and strange, for they had  reached the study-door.    \"Come in!\" in the Doctor's deepest and most severe tones, and the next  moment the two boys were standing separated from their preceptor by the  large study-table, while he sat back in his revolving chair with his  finger-tips joined, frowning at them severely from beneath his up-pushed  gold-rimmed spectacles.    There was silence for quite a minute, and it was not the Doctor who  spoke first, but Glyn, who, under the impression that the Doctor was  deep in thought and had forgotten their presence, ventured to say, \"I  beg your pardon, sir; you sent for us,\" and put an end to the mental  debate as to the form in which the subject should be approached.    \"Yes, sir,\" said the Doctor sternly.  \"I have sent for you both, as it  is better that any lapse from the strict rules of my establishment  should be dealt with immediately; not that I wish to be too severe, for  you are both new pupils and strange to the regulations of a high-class  school in England.  You gather, of course, that I am alluding to your  very undignified conduct in the sight of all your fellow-pupils.\"    \"Yes, sir,\" said Glyn; \"about our riding the elephant?\"    \"Of course.  It was disgraceful.  You, to whom I should have looked for  the conduct and demeanour of a gentleman, being the son of an eminent  officer in the army, behaving like some little common street-boy, and  leading your fellow-pupil, in whom from his ignorance of English customs  and etiquette such a lapse might be excused.  It was only the other day  that your father the Colonel, sir, told me that you would set an example  to the young Prince, and here I find you directly snatching at the  opportunity to behave as you have done.\"    \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" cried Glyn, in a voice full of protest, \"it  was--\"    \"Silence, sir!--Yes, what is it?\" cried the Doctor angrily, for there  was a quick tap at the door, and the footman appeared.  \"Have I not told  you, sir, that when I am engaged like this I am not to be interrupted?--  Eh?  Who?\"    \"That showman, sir, wants to see you, sir.\"    \"That showman?\" cried the Doctor angrily.  \"What showman?  What about?\"    \"Come about the damages, sir; the broken fences.  He said he wouldn't  keep you a moment, sir, if you would see him.\"    \"Oh,\" said the Doctor, cooling down.  \"Yes, the damages, the torn-up  hedge and the broken fence.  A most annoying affair.  You can sit down,  gentlemen, while I dismiss this man.--Where is he, Wrench?\"    \"In the hall, sir; on the mat.\"    \"Ho!\" said the Doctor, rising; and he marched slowly out, leaving the  boys looking at one another and then at the busts of the great scholars  of Greece and Rome ranged at intervals upon the cornices of the  bookcases that covered the study-walls.    Neither felt disposed to speak, for an inner door stood ajar, and from  the other side came the faintly heard scratching noise of a pen.    And so in silence some ten minutes or so passed before the Doctor came  in, looking very different of aspect and ready to sign to the boys to  sit down again as they rose at his entrance.    \"A most unpleasant business, young gentlemen,\" he began, as he seated  himself; and sinking back he removed his spectacles, folded them, and  used them to tap his knee; \"but in justice to you I must hasten to say  that this man's coming has given a very different complexion to the  affair.  A very strange, uncultured personage, but most straightforward  and honest.  I like the way in which he has offered to bear all the  expense of repairing the fences.  He speaks most highly of your  gallantry--er--er--er--pluck, he called it--most objectionable phrase!--  in dealing with this savage beast.  H'm, yes, what did he say--tackling  it.  But I was not aware that you had engaged in roping or harnessing  the animal.  He, however, talked of your both managing the monster  wonderfully, and--er--it had never occurred to me before that you had  both had some experience of elephants in India.\"    \"Oh yes, sir,\" cried Glyn eagerly.  \"Singh has elephants of his own, and  we often used to go out together through the forest upon one as big as  that.\"    \"Ha!  Very interesting,\" cried the Doctor.  \"I was under the impression  that your proceedings this morning were--that is--in fact, that you both  did it just for the sake of a ride.\"    \"Oh no, sir,\" cried Glyn.  \"The men were all afraid of the elephant, and  Singh spoke to it in Hindustani, and--\"    \"Yes, yes, exactly,\" said the Doctor, smiling.  \"It was very brave,  and--really, I cannot conceal the fact that I felt alarmed myself when  the great furious beast came charging across the grounds.  Yes, he  speaks highly in praise of your conduct, and really, young gentlemen,  I--I must apologise for having spoken to you as I did while suffering  from a misunderstanding.  Er--hum!\" continued the Doctor didactically,  and he rose slowly to stand waving the gold spectacles through the air,  \"it is the duty of every gentleman when he finds that he is in the wrong  to acknowledge the fact with dignity and good grace.  My dear young  pupils, I hope I have properly expressed myself towards you both; and  let me add that this will be a lesson to us, to me, against speaking in  undue haste, and to you both as--er--    \"Well, gentlemen,\" he continued with a smile, \"I don't think I need  detain you longer from your studies--I mean--er--from your pleasurable  pursuits, as this is a holiday, and we will consider the incident as  closed.\"    Smiling benignantly, the Doctor marched slowly round the end of the  table again, shook hands warmly with both his pupils, and then showed  them to the door.    \"Stop!  By the way, a little idea has occurred to me.  This is a day of  relaxation.  Mr Singh--er--it is an understood thing, as you know, that  your title is to be in abeyance while you are my pupil; for, as I  explained to your guardian, Colonel Severn, it would be better that  there should be no invidious distinctions during your scholastic  career--I should be glad if you and your friend the Colonel's son would  dine with me this evening.  No dinner-party, but just to meet your "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21316"],[0,"The Adventures of Don Lavington: Nolens Volens (#12)"],[1,"round eyed and staring.    \"Well, what is it?\" said Uncle Josiah.    \"If you please, sir, Mr Smithers the constable came, and I was to tell  you that you're to be at the magistrate's office at eleven, and bring  Master Don with you.\"    \"Yes,\" said Uncle Josiah bitterly; \"at the magistrate's office at  eleven, and take Lindon with me.  Well, Laura, what have you to say to  that?\"    Mrs Lavington gave him an imploring look.    \"Try and find him,\" she whispered, \"for my sake.\"    \"Try and find him!\" he replied angrily, \"I was willing to look over  everything--to try and fight his battle and prove to the world that the  accusation was false.\"    \"Yes, yes, and you will do so now--Josiah--brother.\"    \"I cannot,\" said the old man sternly.  \"He has disgraced me, and openly  declared to the world that the accusation of that scoundrel is true.\"        CHAPTER ELEVEN.    THINKING BETTER OF IT.    Don stood looking at Jem Wimble for some few minutes in silence, as if  the sight of some one else in trouble did him good.  Then he sat down on  the stock of an old anchor, to begin picking at the red rust scales as  he too stared at the ships moored here and there.    The tall masts and rigging had a certain fascination for Don, and each  vessel seemed to offer a way out of his difficulties.  For once on board  a ship with the sails spread, and the open sea before him, he might  cross right away to one of those beautiful lands of which Mike had  spoken, and then--    The thought of Mike altered the case directly, and he sat staring  straight before him at the ships.    Jem was the next to break the silence.    \"Thinking you'd like to go right away, Master Don?\"    \"Yes, Jem.\"    \"So was I, sir.  Only think how nice it would be somewhere abroad, where  there was no Sally.\"    \"And no Uncle Josiah, Jem.\"    \"Ay, and no Mike to get you into trouble.  Be fine, wouldn't it?\"    \"Glorious, Jem.\"    \"Mean to go, Master Don?\"    \"What, and be a miserable coward?  No.\"    \"But you was a-thinking something of the kind, sir.\"    \"Yes, I was, Jem.  Everybody is stupid sometimes, and I was stupid then.  No.  I've thought better of it.\"    \"And you won't go, sir?\"    \"Go?  No.  Why, it would be like saying what Mike accused me of was  true.\"    \"So it would, sir.  Now that's just how I felt.  I says to myself,  `Jem,' I says, `don't you stand it.  What you've got to do is to go  right away and let Sally shift for herself; then she'd find out your  vally,' I says, `and be sorry for what she's said and done,' but I knew  if I did she'd begin to crow and think she'd beat me, and besides, it  would be such a miserable cowardly trick.  No, Mas' Don, I'm going to  grin and bear it, and some day she'll come round and be as nice as she's  nasty now.\"    \"Yes, that's the way to look at it, Jem; but it's a miserable world,  isn't it?\"    \"Well, I arn't seen much on it, Mas' Don.  I once went for a holiday as  far as Bath, and that part on it was miserable enough.  My word, how it  did rain!  In half an hour I hadn't got a dry thread on me.  Deal worse  than Bristol, which isn't the most cheersome o' places when you're  dull.\"    \"No, Jem, it isn't.  Of course you'll be at the court to-morrow?\"    \"I suppose so, Mas' Don.  And I say they'd better ask me if I think you  took that money.  My!  But I would give it to some on 'em straight.  Can  you fight, Mas' Don?\"    \"I don't know, Jem.  I never tried.\"    \"I can.  You don't know what a crack I could give a man.  It's my arms  is so strong with moving sugar-hogsheads, I suppose.  I shouldn't wish  to be the man I hit if I did my best.\"    \"You mean your worst, Jem.\"    \"Course I do, Mas' Don.  Well, as I was going to say, I should just like  to settle that there matter with Mr Mike without the magistrates.  You  give him to me on a clear field for about ten minutes, and I'd make  Master Mike down hisself on his knees, and say just whatever I pleased.\"    \"And what good would that do, Jem?\"    \"Not much to him, Mas' Don, because he'd be so precious sore afterwards,  but it would do me good, and I would feel afterwards what I don't feel  now, and that's cheerful.  Never mind, sir, it'll all come right in the  end.  Nothing like coming out and sitting all alone when you're crabby.  Wind seems to blow it away.  When you've been sitting here a bit you'll  feel like a new man.  Mind me smoking a pipe?\"    \"No, Jem; smoke away.\"    \"Won't have one too, Mas' Don?\"    \"No, Jem; you know I can't smoke.\"    \"Then here goes for mine,\" said Jem, taking a little dumpy clay pipe  from one pocket and a canvas bag from another, in which were some rough  pieces of tobacco leaf.  These he crumbled up and thrust into the bowl,  after which he took advantage of the shelter afforded by an empty cask  to get in, strike a light, and start a pipe.    Once lit up, Jem returned to his old seat, and the pair remained in the  same place till it was getting dusk, and lights were twinkling among the  shipping, when Jem rose and stretched himself.    \"That's your sort, Mas' Don,\" he said.  \"Now I feels better, and I can  smile at my little woman when I get home.  You aren't no worse?\"    \"No, Jem, I am no worse.\"    \"Nothing like coming out when you're red hot, and cooling down.  I'm  cooled down, and so are you.  Come along.\"    Don felt a sensation of reluctance to return home, but it was getting  late, and telling himself that he had nothing to do now but act a  straightforward manly part, and glad that he had cast aside his foolish  notions about going away, he trudged slowly back with his companion,  till turning into one of the dark and narrow lanes leading from the  water side, they suddenly became aware that they were not alone, for a  stoutly-built sailor stepped in front of them.    \"Got a light, mate?\" he said.    \"Light?  Yes,\" said Jem readily; and he prepared to get out his flint  and steel, when Don whispered something in his ear.    \"Ay, to be sure,\" he said; \"why don't you take a light from him?\"    \"Eh?  Ah, to be sure,\" said the sailor.  \"I forgot.  Here, Joe, mate,  open the lanthorn and give us a light.\"    Another sailor, a couple of yards away, opened a horn lanthorn, and the  first man bent down to light his pipe, the dull rays of the coarse  candle showing something which startled Don.    \"Come on, Jem,\" he whispered; \"make haste.\"    \"Ay?  To be sure, my lad.  There's nothing to mind though.  Only  sailors.\"    As he spoke there were other steps behind, and more from the front, and  Don realised that they were hemmed in that narrow lane between two  little parties of armed men.    Just then the door of the lanthorn was closed, and the man who bore it  held it close to Jem's face.    \"Well?\" said that worthy, good-temperedly, \"what d'yer think of me, eh?  Lost some one?  'Cause I arn't him.\"    \"I don't know so much about that,\" said a voice; and a young-looking man  in a heavy pea jacket whispered a few words to one of the sailors.    Don felt more uneasy, for he saw that the point of a scabbard hung down  below the last speaker's jacket, which bulged out as if there were  pistols beneath, all of which he could dimly make out in the faint glow  of the lanthorn.    \"Come away, Jem, quick!\" whispered Don.    \"Here, what's your hurry, my lads?\" said the youngish man in rather an  authoritative way.  \"Come and have a glass of grog.\"    \"No, thank ye,\" said Jem; \"I've got to be home.\"    \"So have we, mate,\" said the hoarse-voiced man who had asked for a  light; \"and when a horficer asks you to drink you shouldn't say no.\"    \"I knew it, Jem,\" whispered Don excitedly.  \"Officer!  Do you hear?\"    \"What are you whispering about, youngster?\" said the man in the pea  jacket.  \"You let him be.\"    \"Good-night,\" said Jem shortly.  \"Come on, Mas' Don.\"    He stepped forward, but the young man hurried on the men, who had now  closed in round them; and as Jem gave one of them a sturdy push to get  off, the thrust was returned with interest.    \"Where are you shovin' to, mate?\" growled the man.  \"Arn't the road wide  enough for you?\"    \"Quiet, my lad,\" said the officer sharply.  \"Here, you come below here  and have a glass of grog.\"    \"I don't want no grog,\" said Jem; \"and I should thank you to tell your  men to let me pass.\"    \"Yes, by-and-by,\" said the officer.  \"Now then, my lads, sharp.\"    A couple of men crowded on Jem, one of them forcing himself between the  sturdy fellow and Don, whose cheeks flushed with anger as he felt  himself rudely thrust up against the wall of one of the houses.    \"Here, what are you doing of?\" cried Jem sharply.    \"Being civil,\" said one of the men with a laugh.  \"There, no nonsense.  Come quiet.\"    He might just as well have said that to an angry bull, for as he and his  companion seized Jem by the arms, they found for themselves how strong  those arms were, one being sent staggering against Don, and the other  being lifted off his legs and dropped upon his back.    \"Now, Mas' Don, run!\" shouted Jem.    But before the words were well out of his lips, the party closed in upon  him, paying no heed to Don, who in accordance with Jem's command had  rushed off in retreat.    A few moments later he stopped, for Jem was not with him, but struggling  with all his might in the midst of the knot of men who were trying to  hold him.    \"Mas' Don!  Help, help!\" roared Jem; and Don dashed at the gang, his  fists clenched, teeth set, and a curious singing noise in his ears.  But  as he reached the spot where his companion was making a desperate  struggle for his liberty, Jem shouted again,--    \"No, no!  Mas' Don; run for it, my lad, and get help if you can.\"    Like a flash it occurred to Don that long before he could get help Jem  would be overpowered and carried off, and with the natural fighting  instinct fully raised, he struck out with all his might as he strove to  get to the poor fellow, who was writhing and heaving, and giving his  captors a tremendous task to hold him.    \"Here"]]]
