The work here is by far the  best in any part of the canyon. The beams of the first floor are  represented only by the ends which pass through the walls, the middle  portion being gone.    The cliff wall forming one side of the rooms in the tower was coated  with a wash of yellowish clay to correspond with the other sides. It  shows bare rock at the points where the floors abutted against it. The  roof of the second story or middle room was 10 inches thick, and the  marks are on the same level as those of the rooms over the west of the  tower. There are also beam holes in the third story about 4 feet above  its floor, but extending only from the cliff out to its opening.    A singular feature occurs in the tower, which is difficult to explain.  The upper part of the third-story room was coated in the interior with  whitewash, which appears to have been carelessly applied. Small  quantities struck the setback at the floor level and spattered over the  wall below--that of the second-story room. In one case a considerable  quantity of the whitewash struck the top of a beam in what would be the  roof of the second story and scattered over the wall surface below it.  It is therefore clear that at the time when the whitewash was applied,  which was either at the time or subsequent to the habitation of the  rooms, there was no floor to the third-story room nor roof to the second  story. The stains of whitewash never go below the floor level of the  second story.    The house remains in the eastern cove are partly shown in plate XLIX,  which is from a photograph. The point of view is from the ledge in front  of the tower. The ruins rest on a ledge in the back of the cove formed  of debris well compacted and apparently consisting partly of sheep dung.  The rooms are small, sometimes three deep against the back of the cove,  and many of them could only have been used for storage. The principal  structure is the western kiva, with its chimney-like attachments. This  is described at length on pages 177, 179, 186, and 187. Adjoining it on  the east is another kiva, part of whose wall is still two stories high,  and clearly shown in the illustration. Some 50 or 60 feet to the east or  southeast there is another circular structure, which apparently had no  interior bench. The small semicircular structure shown on the plan and  in the illustration, which rests against and is roofed by the rock, is a  Navaho burial cist, and another of these cists, of large size, occurs  west of the principal kiva; but the ruin as a whole contains much less  evidence of Navaho work than those farther down the canyon.    Many of the walls are built entirely of small pieces of stone, not more  than 3 or 4 inches long by 2 inches wide and half an inch to an inch and  a half thick. This construction is especially noticeable in inner walls.  The joints are carefully plastered, evidently with the hand, but the mud  is seldom allowed to cover the stone. It appears to have been applied  externally, in pellets about the size of a walnut. The general thickness  of walls is about 15 inches, although on the intermediate ledge they are  over 2 feet, but some of the less important walls consist of a single  layer, 6 to 8 inches thick. Walls are sometimes seen here supported by  vertical timbers incorporated in them after the manner later described  at some length. Ends of logs project here and there from the debris on  the slope, but probably many of them are the debris of roofs.    The peculiar and anomalous features presented by the remains on the  intermediate ledge seem to require some explanation. This portion of the  ruin is not only different from the other portions, but different also  from anything else in the canyon, and the difference is not one of  degree only. Doubtless systematic excavation in the various parts of the  ruin would afford an explanation. In the absence of such work we can  only speculate on the problem.    The occurrence of two chimney-like shafts in connection with the  rectangular rooms west of the tower is significant. Nowhere else in the  canyons, except in the Casa Blanca ruin, do these structures occur, so  far as known, except in connection with circular kivas. As regards the  ruin named, it is almost certain that it was occupied in the historic  period, probably in the seventeenth century.    The division of the ruin into three separate parts, the absence of kivas  in the western cove, and the method of access to that portion all  attract attention. If there were monks or other Spaniards in the  settlement, the explanation would be plain; they and those of the  natives allied with them would occupy the central ledge, and the  anomalous features would be natural under the circumstances. Such a  hypothesis would explain also the source of the many unaboriginal  features which are found in other parts of the canyon, but there is no  direct evidence to support it. It should be mentioned, however, that the  walls here rest on about half an inch of substance which resembles  compacted sheep dung. If the substance is really such, the walls must  have been built within the historic period.      [Illustration: Fig. 17--Ruin in a rock cove.]    At the point marked 48 on the map there is a ruin which resembles  somewhat in its location an example previously described (page 98). It  is situated in a cove in a jutting point of rock, forming part of the  talus slope, and is about 20 feet above the bottom, which it overlooks.  Figure 17 shows the character of the site, and figure 18 is a ground  plan. At the back of the cove a row of small rooms, five or six in  number, was built against the rock. In front of these there were two  kivas and perhaps other rooms. Only fragments of these now remain, but  it can still be seen that both kivas had interior benches, and that the  western one has been plastered with several successive coats--at least  four. There are no pictographs on the back wall, and but little  staining by smoke. The masonry is rather rough, consisting of large  stones, pretty well chinked with small spawls.      [Illustration: Fig. 18--Ground plan of a ruin in a rock cove.]    Some of the walls were plastered. The western end of the ruin has been  partially restored by the Navaho and used for burial cists, and other  cists have been built on the site independent of the old walls, as shown  on the plan. Figure 19 is a ground plan of a ruin on a ledge near the  mouth of Del Muerto, at the point marked 15 on the map. It is situated  at the back of a considerable bay, directly opposite a large rock at the  mouth of Del Muerto, and overlooked the whole of the bottom land in the  bay. The houses were built on a bench or ledge, about 30 feet wide,  overhung by the cliff above and dropping down almost vertically to the  bottom land, about 40 feet below, but on the east access to the bench  was easy by a slope of talus extending up to it. The site was covered  with bowlders, and walls have been built over and under them. The  masonry is good, and was composed of larger stones than usual, carefully  chinked with spalls, the work being well done.    There were but 10 rooms on the ground, in addition to one circular kiva;  some of these rooms are too small for habitation, and one of them  appears to have been a rectangular kiva. On the same bench, about 100  feet westward, however, there are traces of other rooms, the walls of  which were very thin. The cliffs back of the ruin and for 200 feet west  of it are covered with pictographs in white and colors.      [Illustration: Fig. 19--Ground plan of a ruin on a ledge.]    Near the center of that portion of the ruin shown on the ground plan  there is a large room which may have been a rectangular kiva. The walls  are over 2 feet thick in the first story, diminishing at the roof level  by a step or setback to the ordinary thickness of about a foot. These  walls, as usual in such structures, were about 2 feet thick; they are  slightly curved, the front wall markedly so, and the interior corners  are well rounded. No reason for this curvature is apparent, and it is  certainly not dictated by the occurrence of the rock over which the wall  is built, as only the point of this rock comes through the wall in the  western side of the front wall. There may have been an opening into the  room through the eastern wall connecting it with the room on that side,  as the masonry is there broken down; but this is doubtful, as the  eastern room itself has no exterior opening. It is more probable that  the large room was entered through the roof, for the thin wall of the  second story shows in front one side of a well-finished doorway.    Just outside of the heavy front wall there is a round hole in the  ground, the remains of a vertical shaft connected with the interior of  the room. The hole is about a foot in diameter, and is neatly plastered  inside, and appears to have been a chimney or a chimney-like structure  such as occur in connection with the kivas in other ruins. It will later  be discussed in detail.    The circular kiva occupies the western end of that part of the room  shown in the plan. It was 15 feet in diameter, and is exceptionally well  built. The wall is standing for about half of its circumference, and was  so neatly finished that the interior coating of plaster was apparently  omitted. There are no traces of inclosing rectangular walls; the  thickness of the kiva walls and the exceptionally large stones used in  parts of it suggest that the kiva stood alone. So far as the walls  remain standing, an interior bench can be traced, about 2 feet wide and  6 feet below the top of the outside wall. On the southeastern side, in  the interior, there is a buttress or projection, which terminates the  bench at this point.

I know the  story of Rakhal! He was spy for Terra twelve years. Twelve years, and  then he fought and flung their filthy money in their faces and left 'em.  But his partner was some Dry-town halfbreed or Terran spy and they  fought wi' clawed gloves, and near killed one another except the  Terrans, who have no honor, stopped 'em. See the marks of the _kifirgh_  on his face!\"    \"By Sharra the golden-chained,\" said Kyral, gazing at me with something  like a grin. \"You are, if nothing else, a very clever man. What are you,  spy, or half-caste of some Ardcarran slut?\"    \"What I am doesn't matter to you,\" I said. \"You have blood-feud with  Rakhal, but mine is older than yours and his life is mine. As you are  bound in honor to kill\"--the formal phrases came easily now to my  tongue; the Earthman had slipped away--\"so you are bound in honor to  help me kill. If anyone beneath your roof knows anything of Rakhal--\"    Kyral's smile bared his teeth.    \"Rakhal works against the Son of the Ape,\" he said, using the insulting  Wolf term for the Terrans. \"If we help you to kill him, we remove a goad  from their flanks. I prefer to let the filthy _Terranan_ spend their  strength trying to remove it themselves. Moreover, I believe you are  yourself an Earthman.    \"You have no right to the courtesy I extend to we, the People of the  Sky. Yet you have drunk wine with me and I have no quarrel with you.\" He  raised his hand in dismissal, outfencing me. \"Leave my roof in safety  and my city with honor.\"    I could not protest or plead. A man's _kihar_, his personal dignity, is  a precious thing in Shainsa, and he had placed me so I could not  compromise mine further in words. Yet I lost _kihar_ equally if I left  at his bidding, like an inferior dismissed.    One desperate gamble remained.    \"A word,\" I said, raising my hand, and while he half turned, startled,  believing I was indeed about to compromise my dignity by a further plea,  I flung it at him:    \"I will bet _shegri_ with you.\"    His iron composure looked shaken. I had delivered a blow to his belief  that I was an Earthman, for it is doubtful if there are six Earthmen on  Wolf who know about _shegri_, the dangerous game of the Dry-towns.    It is no ordinary gamble, for what the bettor stakes is his life,  possibly his reason. Rarely indeed will a man bet _shegri_ unless he has  nothing further to lose.    It is a cruel, possibly decadent game, which has no parallel anywhere in  the known universe.    But I had no choice. I had struck a cold trail in Shainsa. Rakhal might  be anywhere on the planet and half of Magnusson's month was already up.  Unless I could force Kyral to tell what he knew, I might as well quit.    So I repeated: \"I will bet _shegri_ with you.\"    And Kyral stood unmoving.    For what the _shegrin_ wagers is his courage and endurance in the face  of torture and an unknown fate. On his side, the stakes are clearly  determined beforehand. But if he loses, his punishment or penalty is at  the whim of the one who has accepted him, and he may be put to whatever  doom the winner determines.    And this is the contest:    The _shegrin_ permits himself to be tortured from sunrise to sunset. If  he endures he wins. It is as simple as that. He can stop the torture at  any moment by a word, but to do so is a concession of defeat.    This is not as dangerous as it might, at first, seem. The other party to  the bet is bound by the ironclad codes of Wolf to inflict no permanent  physical damage (no injury that will not heal with three suncourses).  But from sunrise to sunset, any torment or painful ingenuity which the  half-human mentality of Wolf can devise must be endured.    The man who can outthink the torture of the moment, the man who can hold  in his mind the single thought of his goal--that man can claim the  stakes he has set, as well as other concessions made traditional.    The silence grew in the hall. Dallisa had straightened and was watching  me intently, her lips parted and the tip of a little red tongue visible  between her teeth. The only sound was the tiny crunching as the fat  woman nibbled at nuts and cast their shells into the brazier. Even the  child on the steps had abandoned her game with the crystal dice, and sat  looking up at me with her mouth open. Finally Kyral demanded, \"Your  stakes?\"    \"Tell me all you know of Rakhal Sensar and keep silence about me in  Shainsa.\"    \"By the red shadow,\" Kyral burst out, \"you have courage, Rascar!\"    \"Say only yes or no!\" I retorted.    Rebuked, he fell silent. Dallisa leaned forward and again, for some  unknown reason, I thought of a girl with hair like spun black glass.    Kyral raised his hand. \"I say no. I have blood-feud with Rakhal and I  will not sell his death to another. Further, I believe you are Terran  and I will not deal with you. And finally, you have twice saved my life  and I would find small pleasure in torturing you. I say no. Drink again  with me and we part without a quarrel.\"    Beaten, I turned to go.    \"Wait,\" said Dallisa.    She stood up and came down from the dais, slowly this time, walking with  dignity to the rhythm of her musically clashing chains. \"I have a  quarrel with this man.\"    I started to say that I did not quarrel with women, and stopped myself.  The Terran concept of chivalry has no equivalent on Wolf.    She looked at me with her dark poison-berry eyes, icy and level and  amused, and said, \"I will bet _shegri_ with you, unless you fear me,  Rascar.\"    And I knew suddenly that if I lost, I might better have trusted myself  to Kyral and his whip, or to the wild beast-things of the mountains.          CHAPTER EIGHT      I slept little that night.    There is a tale told in Daillon of a _shegri_ where the challenger was  left in a room alone, where he was blindfolded and told to await the  beginning of the torment.    Somewhere in those dark hours of waiting, between the unknown and the  unexpected, the hours of telling over to himself the horrors of past  _shegri_, the torture of anticipation alone became the unbearable. A  little past noon he collapsed in screams of horror and died raving,  unmarred, untouched.    Daybreak came slowly, and with the first streamers of light came Dallisa  and the white _chak_, maliciously uninvolved, sniffing his way through  the shabby poverty of the great hall. They took me to a lower dungeon  where the slant of the sunlight was less visible. Dallisa said, \"The sun  has risen.\"    I said nothing. Any word may be interpreted as a confession of defeat. I  resolved to give them no excuse. But my skin crawled and I had that  peculiar prickling sensation where the hair on my forearms was  bristling erect with tension and fear.    Dallisa said to the _chak_, \"His gear was not searched. See that he has  swallowed no anesthetic drugs.\"    Briefly I gave her credit for thoroughness, even while I wondered in a  split second why I had not thought of this. Drugs could blur  consciousness, at least, or suspend reality. The white nonhuman sprang  forward and pinioned my arms with one strong, spring-steel forearm. With  his other hand he forced my jaws open. I felt the furred fingers at the  back of my throat, gagged, struggled briefly and doubled up in  uncontrollable retching.    Dallisa's poison-berry-eyes regarded me levelly as I struggled upright,  fighting off the dizzy sickness of disgust. Something about her  impassive face stopped me cold. I had been, momentarily, raging with  fury and humiliation. Now I realized that this had been a calculated,  careful gesture to make me lose my temper and thus sap my resistance.    If she could set me to fighting, if she could make me spend my strength  in rage, my own imagination would fight on her side to make me lose  control before the end. Swimming in the glare of her eyes, I realized  she had never thought for a moment that I had taken any drug. Acting on  Kyral's hint that I was a Terran, she was taking advantage of the  well-known Terran revulsion for the nonhuman.    \"Blindfold him,\" Dallisa commanded, then instantly countermanded that:  \"No, strip him first.\"    The _chak_ ripped off shirtcloak, shirt, shoes, breeches, and I had my  first triumph when the wealed clawmarks on my shoulders--worse, if  possible, than those which disfigured my face--were laid bare. The  _chak_ screwed up his muzzle in fastidious horror, and Dallisa looked  shaken. I could almost read her thoughts:    _If he endured this, what hope have I to make him cry mercy?_    Briefly I remembered the months I lay feverish and half dead, waiting  for the wounds Rakhal had inflicted to heal, those months when I had  believed that nothing would ever hurt me again, that I had known the  worst of all suffering. But I had been younger then.    Dallisa had picked up two small sharp knives. She weighed them,  briefly, gesturing to the _chak_. Without resisting, I let myself be  manhandled backward, spreadeagled against the wall.    Dallisa commanded, \"Drive the knives through his palms to the wall!\"    My hands twitched convulsively, anticipating the slash of steel, and my  throat closed in spasmodic dread. This was breaking the compact, bound  as they were not to inflict physical damage. I opened my lips to protest  this breaking of the bond of honor and met her dark blazing stare, and  suddenly the sweat broke out on my forehead. I had placed myself wholly  in their hands, and as Kyral had said, they were in no way bound by  honor to respect a pledge to a Terran!    Then, as my hands clenched into fists, I forced myself to relax. This  was a bluff, a mental trick to needle me into breaking the pact and  pleading for mercy. I set my lips, spread my palms wide against the wall  and waited"]]]
