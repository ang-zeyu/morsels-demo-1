He caused the old knight to have his lands again, and  bade the others that they should betake themselves to the court of King  Arthur to be cheered and comforted, while their possessions, which Sir  Turquine had robbed of them, should be given back to them.    Then fared Sir Lancelot further afield, glad exceedingly that he had  escaped the foul plots of the four witch queens, and also that he had  vanquished the evil Sir Turquine.    Then he rode a great while in a deep and dark forest, and as he  followed the winding ways, suddenly he saw a black hound before him,  with its nose to the ground as if seeking a scent. He followed the  beast, and ever she looked behind her. Soon she left the forest, and  picked her way through a great marsh, and Sir Lancelot followed, until  in the wide distance he saw a little hill with trees upon it, and in  the midst a ruined manor.    The hound went towards the ruin and Sir Lancelot followed. The wall was  broken down in many places, and the path all overgrown and weedy, and  as he came to the courtyard before the house, he saw the fishponds  choked with weeds and the horseblock green with moss, and in the great  doorway grew charnel and hellebore, and the spiked hemlock waved and  spilt its seed in the wind. The windows hung by their hinges, and the  green moss crept down the wide wet cracks in the walls.    But the dog ran over the drawbridge into the house, and Sir Lancelot  gat from his horse and tethered it to the post beside the horseblock,  and so went across the bridge, which was full sodden and worm-eaten,  and bent beneath his weight.    Coming into a great hall, foul with many rotting leaves, he saw a table  in the midst thereof, and on it was a knight that was a seemly man, and  he lay as if he were dead, and the black hound licked his wound. And by  his side there was a lovely lady, who started up, weeping and wringing  her hands, and she said:    'O knight, too much evil have you brought to me!'    'Why say ye so?' said Sir Lancelot; 'I never did harm to this knight,  for hither did this hound lead me, and therefore, fair lady, be not  displeased with me, for grief is upon me for your sorrow and your  sadness.'    'Truly, sir,' said the lady, and she laid her face in her hands and  sobbed full sorely, so that Sir Lancelot was much stirred thereat, 'I  trow, as ye say it, that you are not the knight that hath near slain my  love and my husband. And never may he be healed of his deadly wound  except some good knight aid me. But he must be so bold and valiant a  man, that never, I think, may I find such a one in the little time I  have before my dear lord shall die!'    'Now on the honour of my knighthood,' replied Sir Lancelot, 'I do not  presume that I am such a one as you desire; but if I may aid you and  ease your sorrow, that would I do most willingly. What is it I should  do?'    'Oh, sir knight!' cried the lady, and her lovely eyes looked full  thankfully at Sir Lancelot, 'if ye would, it were the greatest deed you  have ever done, however bold a knight ye may be. For this my lord is  sore wounded by a knight whom he met in the forest this day, and by one  thing only may he be made whole. For there is a lady, a sorceress, that  dwelleth in a castle here beside, and she hath told me that my  husband's wounds may never be whole till I may find a knight that would  go at midnight into the Chapel Perilous beside the Mere, and that  therein he should find before the high altar a sword, and the shroud in  which the dead wizard-knight is lapped, and with that sword my  husband's wounds should be searched, and a piece of the shroud should  bind them.'    'This is a marvellous thing,' said Sir Lancelot, 'and I will essay it.  But what is your husband's name?'    'Sir,' she said, 'his name is Sir Meliot de Logres.'    'That me repenteth,' said Sir Lancelot, 'for he is a fellow of the  Round Table, and for him will I do all in my power.'    Going to the table, he looked upon the ashen face of the wounded man,  and it was Sir Meliot, even as the lady said.    'Now, sir,' said the lady, when Sir Lancelot had mounted his horse, 'do  ye follow that hard way across the marsh, and it will lead ye by  midnight to the Chapel Perilous, and may ye speed well.'    Right so, Sir Lancelot departed, and the sun was near its setting.    For some hours Sir Lancelot fared across the marsh, until it was deep  night, save for the stars; then he came upon a broad road, grass-grown  and banked high, where the night wind piped in the long grass. This he  knew was a road which the great Roman necromancers had wrought, and he  thought he had missed his way, for there was no other path.    As he stood marvelling, the figure of a man, tall and gaunt and but  half clad, came down the broad road towards him, and cried in a hollow  voice:    'For the love of charity, sir knight, give to a poor man who is  outcast.'    Sir Lancelot pitied the sunken eyes of the poor man, and gave him alms.    'God give thee comfort, poor soul,' said the knight, 'and get thee a  roof, for the night wind blows chill.'    'God bless thee, sir knight,' said the man, in awful tones, 'for  courtesy and pity such as thine are rare. Whither goest thou this  night?'    'I seek the Chapel Perilous,' said Sir Lancelot.    At which the shape threw back its head and cried out as if with great  sorrow.    'God fend thee, sir knight,' he said, 'and bring thee safe alive. What  thou gettest there, keep thou in thy hands until the dawn, or thy soul  shall suffer death.'    Then he vanished, and Sir Lancelot knew it had been a phantom.    Then as he crossed himself, he looked up, and through some thin and  withered trees a little way off upon a slope he saw the shimmer of  light, as if a chapel was lit up. He went towards it, and he saw a high  wall that was broken down in many places, and an old grey chapel  beyond, and the windows were shimmering with a ghostly light. As he  came through the trees he saw they were all dead, with neither leaf nor  twig upon them, their roots were crooked out of the ground as if they  would throw his horse, and their limbs were stretched as if they  strained to clutch him.    Coming to the gate in the wall, his horse trembled and plunged, and  would go no further; whereat Sir Lancelot alighted, and tied it to a  thorn-tree, and went through the gate. By the ghostly light that came  from the windows of the ruined chapel he saw that under the eaves were  hung fair shields, with rich devices, and all were turned upside down.  Many of them were those of knights he had known or heard of, long since  dead or lost. When he had made a few steps on the grass-grown pathway  towards the door, of a sudden he saw, coming from the church, thirty  tall knights, each a foot higher than he, each in black armour, and  each with sword uplifted, as they rushed towards him.    Their feet and their armour made no sound as they pressed forwards, and  a thin blue flame licked about each naked sword.    They came upon him, but Sir Lancelot, with a prayer to God, dressed his  shield and sword and stood firm, though his flesh quaked and his tongue  clave to the roof of his mouth. They mowed and gnashed at him, and  heaved their swords about him; then suddenly their vizors went up and  he looked into their faces. And at that he was sore adread, for he knew  they were dead men.    But he would not be overcome, and said in a loud voice:    'In the name of God, avaunt ye!'    He made a step forward, and they scattered before him, but followed  closely behind. Then he went into the chapel, where he saw no light but  a dim lamp burning upon the altar. It was an old, old chapel, with dust  upon its floor like a thick carpet, the walls and windows were holed  and broken, and the timber of the seats was rotten.    He went up to the high altar, and saw before it a trestle, and upon it  was a dead man, all covered with a cloth of silk. Sir Lancelot stooped  down, and with his sword cut a piece of that cloth away.    With that his blood seemed turned to water, and his feet seemed eager  to run towards the door, for with a mighty roar the earth shook beneath  him, and the walls of the chapel rocked. But he looked for the sword  which he must take, and saw it under the trestle, and picked it up and  went out of the chapel.    The ghosts of the knights pressed about him as he walked, and strove to  tear the sword from his grasp. But he would not suffer them to take it,  and when he reached the gate they could no further go, and so left him.    At the gate there came running up to him a fair damsel, crying to him:    'O brave knight, give me the sword and the cloth, that I may take them  at once to my mistress, the lady of Sir Meliot, for he is at the point  of death, and she is waiting in sorrow and tears beside him.'    But Sir Lancelot remembered the words of the phantom beggar, and made  reply:    'Fair damsel, I shall take them myself to the lady of Sir Meliot, for  these things I may not give to any until the dawning.'    The damsel would have torn the sword and the cloth full hastily from  his hands, but he was aware of her intent, and hindered her, and bade  her in the name of God to withdraw.    Whereat, with a great shriek, she vanished.    'Now,' said Sir Lancelot, 'may God, who has brought me through these  evil adventures, shield me from any further subtle crafts of these foul  things.'    Straightway he mounted his horse, and took his way towards the marsh,  so that he should give the sword and the cloth into the hands of the  lady of Sir Meliot, for the healing of her lord.    But at the dawn Merlin met him.    'Sir Lancelot,' said the old white wizard, 'ye have no need to go to  the ruined manor, except ye would have the proof of what I tell you.'    'And what is that?' asked Sir Lancelot.    'That all that hath befallen thee hath been done by evil magic,'  replied Merlin.

The Lord Mayor had no authority to issue  a license for the Queen's Men to play at the Theatre, for that  structure was outside the jurisdiction of the city. The Privy Council  itself, no doubt, had issued such a general license when the company  was organized under royal patronage.[92] And now, ten months later,  on November 26, 1583, the Council sends to the Lord Mayor a request  \"that Her Majesty's players may be suffered to play ... within the  city and liberties _between this and shrovetide next_\"[93]--in other  words, during the winter season when access to the Theatre was  difficult. It was customary for troupes to seek permission to act  within the city during the winter months.[94] Thus the Queen's Men, in  a petition written probably in the autumn of the following year, 1584,  requested the Privy Council to dispatch \"favorable letters unto the  Lord Mayor of London to permit us to exercise within the city,\" and  the Lord Mayor refused, with the significant remark that \"if in winter  ... the foulness of season do hinder the passage into the fields to  play, the remedy is ill conceived to bring them into London.\"[95]  Obviously the Queen's Men were seeking permission to play in the city  only during the cold winter months; during the balmy spring, summer,  and autumn months--for actors the best season of the year--they  occupied their commodious playhouse in \"the fields.\"    [Footnote 92: Such a license would include also permission to act in  the provinces. This latter was soon needed, for shortly after their  organization the Queen's Men were driven by the plague to tour the  provinces. They were in Cambridge on July 9, and probably returned to  London shortly after. See Murray, _English Dramatic Companies_, I, 8.]    [Footnote 93: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 66.]    [Footnote 94: Lord Hunsdon, on October 8, 1594, requested the Lord  Mayor to permit the Chamberlain's Men \"to play this winter time within  the city at the Cross Keys in Gracious Street.\" See The Malone  Society's _Collections_, I, 67.]    [Footnote 95: The Malone Society's _Collections_, I, 170, 172.]    That this playhouse for a time, at least, was the Theatre is indicated  by several bits of evidence. Thus the author of _Martin's Month's  Mind_ (1589) speaks of \"twittle-twattles that I had learned in  ale-houses and at the Theatre of Lanham and his fellows.\" Again, Nash,  in _Pierce Penniless_ (1592), writes: \"Tarleton at the Theatre made  jests of him\"; Harrington, in _The Metamorphosis of Ajax_ (1596):  \"Which word was after admitted into the Theatre with great applause,  by the mouth of Master Tarleton\"; and the author of _Tarlton's Newes  out of Purgatory_ (_c._ 1589) represents Tarleton as connected with  the Theatre. Now, unless Lanham, Tarleton, and their \"fellows\" usually  or sometimes acted at the Theatre, it is hard to understand these and  other similar passages.    The following episode tends to prove the same thing. On June 18, 1584,  William Fleetwood, Recorder, wrote to Lord Burghley:[96]         Right honorable and my very good lord. Upon Whitsunday there       was a very good sermon preached at the new churchyard near       Bethelem, whereat my Lord Mayor was with his brethren; and       by reason no plays were the same day, all the city was       quiet. Upon Monday I was at the Court.... That night I       returned to London and found all the wards full of watchers;       the cause thereof was for that very near the Theatre or       Curtain, at the time of the plays, there lay a prentice       sleeping upon the grass; and one Challes, at Grostock, did       turn upon the toe upon the belly of the same prentice.       Whereupon the apprentice start up.    [Footnote 96: The letter is printed in full in The Malone Society's  _Collections_, I, 164.]    In the altercation that followed, Challes remarked that \"prentices  were but the scum of the world.\" This led to a general rising of  apprentices, and much disorder throughout the city. Fleetwood records  the upshot thus:         Upon Sunday my Lord [Mayor] sent two aldermen to the court       for the suppressing and pulling down of the Theatre and       Curtain. All the Lords [of the Privy Council] agreed       thereunto saving my Lord Chamberlain and Mr.       Vice-Chamberlain. But we obtained a letter to suppress them       all. Upon the same night I sent for the Queen's Players [at       the Theatre?] and my Lord Arundel's Players [at the       Curtain?] and they all willingly obeyed the Lords's letters.       The chiefest of Her Highness's Players advised me to send       for the owner of the Theatre [James Burbage[97]], who was a       stubborn fellow, and to bind him. I did so. He sent me word       he was my Lord of Hundson's man, and that he would not come       at me; but he would in the morning ride to my lord.    [Footnote 97: This could not have been Hide, as usually stated. Hide  had nothing to do with the management of the Theatre, and was not \"my  Lord of Hunsdon's man.\" Hide's connection with the Theatre as sketched  in this chapter shows the absurdity of such an interpretation of the  document.]    The natural inference from all this is that the Queen's Men and Lord  Arundel's Men were then playing _outside the city_ where they could be  controlled only by \"the Lords's Letters\"; that the Queen's Men were  occupying the Theatre, and that James Burbage was (as we know) not a  member of that company, but merely stood to them in the relation of  \"owner of the Theatre.\"    What Burbage meant by calling himself \"my Lord of Hunsdon's man\" is  not clear. Mr. Wallace contends that when Leicester's Men were  dissolved, Burbage organized \"around the remnants of Leicester's  Company\" a troupe under the patronage of Lord Hunsdon, and that this  troupe, and not the Queen's Men, occupied the Theatre thereafter.[98]  But we hear of Hunsdon's Men at Ludlow in July, 1582; and we find them  presenting a play at Court on December 27, 1582. Since Leicester's  troupe is recorded as acting at Court as late as February 10, 1583, it  seems unlikely that Mr. Wallace's theory as to the origin of Hunsdon's  Men is true. It may be, however, that after the dissolution of  Leicester's Men, Burbage associated himself with Hunsdon's Men, and it  may be that he allowed that relatively unimportant company to occupy  the Theatre for a short time. Hunsdon's Men seem to have been mainly a  traveling troupe; Mr. Murray states that notices of them \"occur  frequently in the provinces,\" but we hear almost nothing of them in  London. Indeed, at the time of the trouble described by Fleetwood,  Hunsdon's Men were in Bath.[99] If Burbage was a member of the troupe,  he certainly did not accompany them on their extended tours; and when  they played in London, if they used the Theatre, they must have used  it jointly with the Queen's Men.    [Footnote 98: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 11.]    [Footnote 99: Murray, _English Dramatic Companies_, I, 321.]    Late in 1585 the Theatre was affiliated with the adjacent Curtain.  Burbage and Brayne made an agreement with the proprietor of that  playhouse whereby the Curtain might be used \"as an easore\" [easer?] to  the Theatre, and \"the profits of the said two playhouses might for  seven years space be in divident between them.\" This agreement, we  know, was carried out, but whether it led to an exchange of companies,  or what effect it had upon the players, we cannot say. Possibly to  this period of joint management may be assigned the witticism of Dick  Tarleton recorded as having been uttered \"at the Curtain\" where the  Queen's Men were then playing.[100] It may even be that as one result  of the affiliation of the two houses the Queen's Men were transferred  to the Curtain.    [Footnote 100: _Tarlton's Jests_, ed. by J.O. Halliwell, p. 16.  Tarleton died in 1588.]    In 1590, as we learn from the deposition of John Alleyn, the Theatre  was being used by the Admiral's Men.[101] This excellent company had  been formed early in 1589 by the separation of certain leading players  from Worcester's Men, and it had probably occupied the Theatre since  its organization. Its star actor, Edward Alleyn, was then at the  height of his powers, and was producing with great success Marlowe's  splendid plays. We may suppose that the following passage refers to  the performance of the Admiral's Men at the Theatre:         He had a head of hair like one of my devils in _Dr.       Faustus_, when the old Theatre crackt and frightened the       audience.[102]    [Footnote 101: Wallace, _op. cit._, pp. 101, 126.]    [Footnote 102: _The Black Booke_, 1604.]    Late in 1590 the Admiral's Men seem to have been on bad terms with  Burbage,[103] and when John Alleyn made his deposition, February 6,  1592, they had certainly left the Theatre. Mr. Greg, from entirely  different evidence, has concluded that they were dispersed in  1591,[104] and this conclusion is borne out by the legal document  cited above.    [Footnote 103: Wallace, _op. cit._, p. 101.]    [Footnote 104: Greg, _Henslowe's Diary_, II, 83. The Admiral's Men  were reorganized in 1594, and occupied the Rose under Henslowe's  management.]    The next company that we can definitely associate with the Theatre was  the famous Lord Chamberlain's Men. On April 16, 1594, Lord Strange,  the Earl of Derby, died, and the chief members of his troupe--William  Shakespeare, Richard Burbage, John Heminges, William Kempe, Thomas  Pope, George Bryan, and Augustine Phillips--organized a new company  under the patronage of the Lord Chamberlain. For ten days, in June,  1594, they acted at Newington Butts under the management of Philip  Henslowe, then went, probably at once, to the Theatre, which they made  their home until the Burbage lease of the property expired in the  spring of 1597. Here, among other famous plays, they produced the  original _Hamlet_, thus referred to by Lodge in _Wit's Miserie_, 1596: "]]]
