I have other reasons for abridging my stay at Bath--You know sister  Tabby's complexion--If Mrs Tabitha Bramble had been of any other race,  I should certainly have considered her as the most--. But, the truth  is, she has found means to interest my affection; or, rather, she is  beholden to the force of prejudice, commonly called the ties of  blood. Well, this amiable maiden has actually commenced a flirting  correspondence with an Irish baronet of sixty-five. His name is Sir Ulic  Mackilligut. He is said to be much out at elbows; and, I believe, has  received false intelligence with respect to her fortune. Be that as  it may, the connexion is exceedingly ridiculous, and begins already  to excite whispers. For my part, I have no intention to dispute her  free-agency; though I shall fall upon some expedient to undeceive her  paramour, as to the point which he has principally in view. But I don't  think her conduct is a proper example for Liddy, who has also attracted  the notice of some coxcombs in the Rooms; and Jery tells me, he suspects  a strapping fellow, the knight's nephew, of some design upon the girl's  heart. I shall, therefore, keep a strict eye over her aunt and her,  and even shift the scene, if I find the matter grow more serious--You  perceive what an agreeable task it must be, to a man of my kidney, to  have the cure of such souls as these.--But, hold, You shall not have  another peevish word (till the next occasion) from    Yours, MATT. BRAMBLE BATH, April 28.          To Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.    DEAR KNIGHT,    I think those people are unreasonable, who complain that Bath is a  contracted circle, in which the same dull scenes perpetually revolve,  without variation--I am, on the contrary, amazed to find so small a  place so crowded with entertainment and variety. London itself can  hardly exhibit one species of diversion, to which we have not something  analogous at Bath, over and above those singular advantages that are  peculiar to the place. Here, for example, a man has daily opportunities  of seeing the most remarkable characters of the community. He sees  them in their natural attitudes and true colours; descended from their  pedestals, and divested of their formal draperies, undisguised by art  and affectation--Here we have ministers of state, judges, generals,  bishops, projectors, philosophers, wits, poets, players, chemists,  fiddlers, and buffoons. If he makes any considerable stay in the place,  he is sure of meeting with some particular friend, whom he did not  expect to see; and to me there is nothing more agreeable than such  casual reencounters. Another entertainment, peculiar to Bath, arises  from the general mixture of all degrees assembled in our public  rooms, without distinction of rank or fortune. This is what my uncle  reprobates, as a monstrous jumble of heterogeneous principles; a vile  mob of noise and impertinence, without decency or subordination. But  this chaos is to me a source of infinite amusement.    I was extremely diverted last ball-night to see the Master of the  Ceremonies leading, with great solemnity, to the upper end of the room,  an antiquated Abigail, dressed in her lady's cast-clothes; whom he (I  suppose) mistook for some countess just arrived at the Bath. The  ball was opened by a Scotch lord, with a mulatto heiress from St  Christopher's; and the gay colonel Tinsel danced all the evening  with the daughter of an eminent tinman from the borough of Southwark.  Yesterday morning, at the Pump-room, I saw a broken-winded  Wapping landlady squeeze through a circle of peers, to salute her  brandy-merchant, who stood by the window, propped upon crutches; and a  paralytic attorney of Shoe-lane, in shuffling up to the bar, kicked the  shins of the chancellor of England, while his lordship, in a cut bob,  drank a glass of water at the pump. I cannot account for my being  pleased with these incidents, any other way, than by saying they are  truly ridiculous in their own nature, and serve to heighten the humour  in the farce of life, which I am determined to enjoy as long as I can.    Those follies, that move my uncle's spleen, excite my laughter. He is  as tender as a man without a skin; who cannot bear the slightest touch  without flinching. What tickles another would give him torment; and  yet he has what we may call lucid intervals, when he is remarkably  facetious--Indeed, I never knew a hypochondriac so apt to be infected  with good-humour. He is the most risible misanthrope I ever met with.  A lucky joke, or any ludicrous incident, will set him a-laughing  immoderately, even in one of his most gloomy paroxysms; and, when the  laugh is over, he will curse his own imbecility. In conversing with  strangers, he betrays no marks of disquiet--He is splenetic with his  familiars only; and not even with them, while they keep his attention  employed; but when his spirits are not exerted externally, they seem  to recoil and prey upon himself--He has renounced the waters with  execration; but he begins to find a more efficacious, and, certainly,  a much more palatable remedy in the pleasures of society. He has  discovered some old friends, among the invalids of Bath; and, in  particular, renewed his acquaintance with the celebrated James Quin, who  certainly did not come here to drink water. You cannot doubt, but that I  had the strongest curiosity to know this original; and it was gratified  by Mr Bramble, who has had him twice at our house to dinner.    So far as I am able to judge, Quin's character is rather more  respectable than it has been generally represented. His bon mots are in  every witling's mouth; but many of them have a rank flavour, which one  would be apt to think was derived from a natural grossness of idea.  I suspect, however, that justice has not been done the author, by the  collectors of those Quiniana; who have let the best of them slip through  their fingers, and only retained such as were suited to the taste and  organs of the multitude. How far he may relax in his hours of jollity, I  cannot pretend to say; but his general conversation is conducted by the  nicest rules of Propriety; and Mr James Quin is, certainly, one of the  best bred men in the kingdom. He is not only a most agreeable companion  but (as I am credibly informed) a very honest man; highly susceptible  of friendship, warm, steady, and even generous in his attachments,  disdaining flattery, and incapable of meanness and dissimulation. Were I  to judge, however, from Quin's eye alone, I should take him to be proud,  insolent, and cruel. There is something remarkably severe and forbidding  in his aspect; and, I have been told, he was ever disposed to insult his  inferiors and dependants.--Perhaps that report has influenced my opinion  of his looks--You know we are the fools of prejudice. Howsoever that may  be, I have as yet seen nothing but his favourable side, and my uncle,  who frequently confers with him, in a corner, declares he is one of the  most sensible men he ever knew--He seems to have a reciprocal regard for  old Squaretoes, whom he calls by the familiar name of Matthew, and often  reminds of their old tavern-adventures: on the other hand, Matthew's  eyes sparkle whenever Quin makes his appearance--Let him be never so  jarring and discordant, Quin puts him in tune; and, like treble and bass  in the same concert, they make excellent music together--. T'other day,  the conversation turning upon Shakespeare, I could not help saying, with  some emotion, that I would give an hundred guineas to see Mr Quin act  the part of Falstaff; upon which, turning to me with a smile, 'And I  would give a thousand, young gentleman (said he) that I could gratify  your longing.' My uncle and he are perfectly agreed in their estimate of  life; which Quin says, would stink in his nostrils, if he did not steep  it in claret.    I want to see this phenomenon in his cups; and have almost prevailed  upon uncle to give him a small turtle at the Bear. In the mean time, I  must entertain you with an incident, that seems to confirm the judgment  of those two cynic philosophers. I took the liberty to differ in opinion  from Mr Bramble, when he observed, that the mixture of people in the  entertainments of this place was destructive of all order and urbanity;  that it rendered the plebeians insufferably arrogant and troublesome,  and vulgarized the deportment and sentiments of those who moved in the  upper spheres of life. He said such a preposterous coalition would bring  us into contempt with all our neighbours; and was worse, in fact, than  debasing the gold coin of the nation. I argued, on the contrary, that  those plebeians who discovered such eagerness to imitate the dress and  equipage of their superiors, would likewise, in time, adopt their maxims  and their manners, be polished by their conversation, and refined by  their example; but when I appealed to Mr Quin, and asked if he did not  think that such an unreserved mixture would improve the whole mass? 'Yes  (said he) as a plate of marmalade would improve a pan of sirreverence.'    I owned I was not much conversant in high-life, but I had seen what were  called polite assemblies in London and elsewhere; that those of Bath  seemed to be as decent as any; and that, upon the whole, the individuals  that composed it, would not be found deficient in good manners and  decorum. 'But let us have recourse to experience (said I)--Jack Holder,  who was intended for a parson, has succeeded to an estate of two  thousand a year, by the death of his elder brother. He is now at the  Bath, driving about in a phaeton and four, with French horns.

The people cried out to him to spare the city, and their  wives and children; saying that they had been misled by evil men,  and regretted bitterly what they had done.    Josephus told them that, assuredly, they deserved that the city  should be wholly destroyed; for that now, when there was so much  that had to be done to prepare for the war which Rome would make  against the country, they troubled the country with their  seditions. The people set up a doleful cry for mercy; and Josephus  then said that, this time, he would spare them; but that their  principal men must be handed over to him.    To this the people joyfully agreed; and a boat, with ten of their  senate, came out to the vessel. Josephus had them bound, and sent  them on board one of the other ships. Another and another boat load  came off; until all the members of the senate, and many of the  principal inhabitants, were prisoners. Some of the men had been  drawn from the other ships, and put on board those with the  prisoners; and these then sailed away to Tarichea.    The people of Tiberias--terrified at seeing so many taken away, and  not knowing how many more might be demanded--now denounced a young  man, named Clitus, as being the leader of the revolt. Seven of the  bodyguard of Josephus had gone down the lake, with the prisoners;  and one Levi, alone, remained. Josephus told him to go ashore, and  to cut off one of the hands of Clitus.    Levi was, however, afraid to land, alone, among such a number of  enemies; whereupon Josephus addressed Clitus, and told him that he  was worthy of death, but that he would spare his life, if his two  hands were sent on board a ship. Clitus begged that he might be  permitted to keep one hand, to which Josephus agreed. Clitus then  drew his sword, and struck off his left hand. Josephus now  professed to be satisfied and, after warning the people against  again listening to evil advisers, sailed away with the whole fleet.  Josephus, that evening, entertained the principal persons among the  prisoners and, in the morning, allowed all to return to Tiberias.    The people there had already learned that they had been duped; but  with time had come reflection and, knowing that in a day or two  Josephus could have assembled the whole population of Galilee  against them, and have destroyed them before any help could come,  there were few who were not well content that their revolt had been  so easily, and bloodlessly, repressed; and Josephus rose, in their  estimation, by the quickness and boldness of the stratagem by which  he had, without bloodshed save in the punishment of Clitus,  restored tranquillity.    Through the winter, Josephus was incessantly active. He endeavored  to organize an army, enrolled a hundred thousand men, appointed  commanders and captains, and strove to establish something like  military drill and order. But the people were averse to leaving  their farms and occupations, and but little progress was made.  Moreover, a great part of the time of Josephus was occupied in  suppressing the revolts, which were continually breaking out in  Sepphoris, Tiberias, and Gamala; and in thwarting the attempts of  John of Gischala, and his other enemies, who strove by means of  bribery, at Jerusalem, to have him recalled--and would have  succeeded, had it not been that the Galileans, save those of the  great cities, were always ready to turn out, in all their force, to  defend him and, by sending deputations to Jerusalem, counteracted  the efforts, there, of his enemies.    John was incessantly engaged, as he accompanied Josephus in his  rapid journeys through the province, either to suppress the risings  or to see to the work of organization; and only once or twice was  he able to pay a short visit to his family.    \"You look worn and fagged, John,\" his cousin said, on the occasion  of his last visit, when spring was close at hand.    \"I am well in health, Mary; but it does try one, to see how all the  efforts of Josephus are marred by the turbulence of the people of  Tiberias and Sepphoris. All his thoughts and time are occupied in  keeping order, and the work of organizing the army makes but little  progress.    \"Vespasian is gathering a great force, at Antioch. His son Titus  will soon join him, with another legion; and they will, together,  advance against us.\"    \"But I hear that the walling of the cities is well-nigh finished.\"    \"That is so, Mary, and doubtless many of them will be able to make  a long defense but, after all, the taking of a city is a mere  question of time. The Romans have great siege engines, which  nothing can withstand but, even if the walls were so strong that  they could not be battered down, each city could, in time, be  reduced by famine. It is not for me, who am but a boy, to judge the  doings of my elders; but it seems to me that this walling of cities  is altogether wrong. They can give no aid to each other and, one by  one, must fall; and all within perish, or be made slaves, for the  Romans give no quarter when they capture a city by storm.    \"It seems to me that it would be far better to hold Jerusalem,  only, with a strong force of fighting men; and for all the rest of  the men capable of carrying arms to gather among the hills, and  there to fight the Romans. When the legion of Cestius was destroyed  we showed that, among defiles and on rocky ground, our active,  lightly-armed men were a match for the Roman soldiers, in their  heavy armor; and in this way I think that we might check even the  legions of Vespasian. The women and the old men and children could  gather in the cities, and admit the Romans when they approached. In  that case they would suffer no harm; for the Romans are clement,  when not opposed.    \"As it is, it seems to me that, in the end, destruction will fall  on all alike. Here in Galilee we have a leader, but he is hampered  by dissensions and jealousies. Samaria stands neutral. Jerusalem,  which ought to take the lead, is torn by faction. There is war in  her streets. She thinks only of herself, and naught of the country;  although she must know that, when the Romans have crushed down all  opposition elsewhere she must, sooner or later, fall. The country  seems possessed with madness, and I see no hope in the future.\"    \"Save in the God of Israel,\" Mary said, gently; \"that is what Simon  and Martha say.\"    \"Save in him,\" John assented; \"but, dear, He suffered us to be  carried away into Babylon; and how are we to expect His aid  now--when the people do naught for themselves, when His city is  divided in itself, when its streets are wet with blood, and its  very altars defiled by conflict? When evil men are made high  priests, and all rule and authority is at an end, what right have  we to expect aid at the hands of Jehovah?    \"My greatest comfort, Mary, is that we lie here on the east of the  lake, and that we are within the jurisdiction of King Agrippa. On  this side, his authority has never been altogether thrown off;  though some of the cities have made common cause with those of the  other side. Still, we may hope that, on this side of Jordan, we may  escape the horrors of war.\"    \"You are out of spirits, John, and take a gloomy view of things;  but I know that Simon, too, thinks that everything will end badly,  and I have heard him say that he, too, is glad that his farm lies  on this side of the lake; and that he wishes Gamala had not thrown  off the authority of the king, so that there might be naught to  bring the Romans across Jordan.    \"Our mother is more hopeful. She trusts in God for, as she says,  though the wealthy and powerful may have forsaken Him, the people  still cling to Him; and He will not let us fall into the hands of  our enemies.\"    \"I hope it will be so, Mary; and I own I am out of spirits, and  look at matters in the worst light. However, I will have a talk  with father, tonight.\"    That evening, John had a long conversation with Simon, and repeated  the forebodings he had expressed to Mary.    \"At any rate, father, I hope that when the Romans approach you will  at least send away my mother, Mary, and the women to a place of  safety. We are but a few miles from Gamala and, if the Romans come  there and besiege it, they will spread through the country; and  will pillage, even if they do not slay, in all the villages. If, as  we trust, God will give victory to our arms, they can return in  peace; if not, let them at least be free from the dangers which are  threatening us.\"    \"I have been thinking of it, John. A fortnight since, I sent old  Isaac to your mother's brother--whose farm, as you know, lies upon  the slopes of Mount Hermon, a few miles from Neve, and very near  the boundary of Manasseh--to ask him if he will receive Martha, and  Mary, and the women, until the troubles are over. He will gladly do  so; and I purpose sending them away, as soon as I hear that the  Romans have crossed the frontier.\"    \"I am, indeed, rejoiced to hear it, father; but do not let them  tarry for that, let them go as soon as the snows have melted on  Mount Hermon, for the Roman cavalry will spread quickly over the  land. Let them go as soon as the roads are fit for travel. I shall  feel a weight off my mind, when I know that they are safe.    \"And does my mother know what you have decided?\"    \"She knows, John, but in truth she is reluctant to go. She says, at  present, that if I stay she also will stay.\"    \"I trust, father, that you will overrule my mother; and that you  will either go with her or, if you stay, you will insist upon her  going. Should you not overcome her opposition, and finally suffer  her, with Miriam and the older women, to remain with you, I hope  that you will send Mary and the young ones to my uncle. The danger,  with them, is vastly greater. The Romans, unless their blood is  heated by opposition, may not interfere with the old people--who  are"]]]
