He or she is greatest who is nearest to God.\"    One morning 'Abdu'l-Baha, on entering the room looked about and said: \"It  is just like a miracle, our being here together. There is no racial,  political or patriotic tie. We are drawn together by the words of  Baha'u'llah, and in like manner will all the races of the earth be drawn  together. Of this, rest assured!\"            THE TRUE BAHA'I      \"I have never heard of Baha'u'llah,\" said a young man. I have only  recently read about this movement, but I recognize the mission of  'Abdu'l-Baha and desire to be a disciple. I have always believed in the  brotherhood of man as the ultimate solvent of all our national and  international difficulties.\"    \"It makes no difference whether you have ever heard of Baha'u'llah or  not,\" was the answer, \"the man who lives the life according to the  teachings of Baha'u'llah is already a Baha'i. On the other hand a man may  call himself a Baha'i for fifty years and if he does not live the life he  is not a Baha'i. An ugly man may call himself handsome, but he deceives no  one, and a black man may call himself white yet he deceives no one: not  even himself!\"            THE COMING OF PEACE      \"By what process\" continued the questioner, \"will this peace on earth be  established? Will it come at once after a universal declaration of the  Truth?\"    \"No, it will come about gradually,\" said 'Abdu'l-Baha. \"A plant that grows  too quickly lasts but a short time. You are my family\" and he looked about  with a smile, \"my new children! if a family lives in unison, great results  are obtained. Widen the circle; when a city lives in intimate accord  greater results will follow, and a continent that is fully united will  likewise unite all other continents. Then will be the time of the greatest  results, for all the inhabitants of the earth belong to one native land.\"            THE PURE HEART      When asked for a definition of a pure heart, 'Abdu'l-Baha said, \"The pure  heart is one that is entirely cut away from self. To be selfless is to be  pure.\"            TRUE SPIRITUALITY      Another morning 'Abdu'l-Baha began at once to speak as he joined the group  of seekers. He said: \"Praise be to God, this century is a glorious  century; may love increase every day; may it strike fire to light the  candle in the darkness, like a gift and mercy of God.    \"Know, O thou possessors of insight, that true spirituality is like unto a  lake of clear water which reflects the divine. Of such was the  spirituality of Jesus Christ. There is another kind which is like a  mirage, seeming to be spiritual when it is not. That which is truly  spiritual must light the path to God, and must result in deeds. We cannot  believe the call to be spiritual when there is no result. Spirit is  reality, and when the spirit in each of us seeks to join itself with the  Great Reality, it must in turn give life. The Jews in the time of Christ  were dead, having no real life, and Jesus actually wafted a new breath  into their bodies. Behold what has been accomplished since!\"            KNOWLEDGE MUST RESULT IN ACTION      A representative from a well known society made reference to its meetings  for the purpose of a search into the reality of truth, and 'Abdu'l-Baha  said \"I know of your work. I think a great deal of it. I know your desire  is to serve mankind, and to draw together Humanity under the banner of  Oneness; but its members must beware less it become only a discussion.  Look about you. How many committees have been formed, and living for a  little while, have died! Committees and Societies can not create or give  life.    \"People get together and talk, but it is God's Word alone that is powerful  in its results. Consider for a moment: you would not trade together if you  had no income from it and derived no benefit! Look at the followers of  Christ. Their power was due to their ardour and their deeds. Every effort  must have its result, else it is not a true effort. You must become the  means of lighting the world of humanity. This is the infallible proof and  sign. Every progress depends on two things, knowledge and practice. First  acquire knowledge, and, when conviction is reached, put it into practice.    \"Once a learned man journeyed to see me to receive my blessing, saying he  knew and comprehended the Baha'i teachings. When I told him that he could  receive the blessings of the Holy Spirit at any time when he put himself  in a receptive attitude to accept them, he said he was always in a  receptive attitude.    \"'What would you do,' I asked 'if I were to suddenly turn and strike you?'  He instantly flared with indignation and strode angrily about the room.    \"After a little I went over and took his arm, saying, 'But you must return  good for evil. Whether I honoured you or despised you, you should follow  the teachings; now you merely read them. Remember the words of Jesus who  said, 'The first shall be last, and the last first.' The man turned, shook  my hand and departed, and I have since heard of many kind acts he has  done.\"    When 'Abdu'l-Baha was addressed by the name of prophet, he answered, \"My  name is 'Abdu'l-Baha, the Servant of God\" [literally, the Slave of  Glory.](1)            VISIT TO THE LORD MAYOR      At the express wish of the Lord Mayor, 'Abdu'l-Baha paid him a visit early  one morning at the Mansion House. The talk turned chiefly upon the social  conditions of great cities, and 'Abdu'l-Baha said that London was the best  regulated city he had seen.    He said: \"Every man walking in the street is free as if he were in his own  kingdom. There is a great spiritual light in London. The effort made for  justice is real and in this country the law is the same for the poor as  for the rich.\" He took great interest in hearing of the care that is taken  of prisoners as they leave jail, and spoke of the land being happy where  the magistrates are as fathers to the people.    Before 'Abdu'l-Baha left London, he went to an East-end hospital to visit  there a young writer lying seriously ill, who was very anxious to see him.            SOME PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS      There is a note in 'Abdu'l-Baha's character that has not been emphasized,  and with which no idea of him is complete. The impressive dignity which  distinguishes his presence and bearing is occasionally lighted by a  delicate and tactful humour, which is as unaffected as it is infectious  and delightful.    On his last afternoon in London, a reporter called to ask him of his  future plans, finding him surrounded by a number of friends who had called  to bid him good-bye. When, in answer to this query, 'Abdu'l-Baha told in  perfect English of his intention to visit Paris and go from there to  Alexandria, the press representative evinced surprise at his faultless  pronunciation. Thereupon 'Abdu'l-Baha proceeded to march with a free  stride up and down the flower-scented drawing room, his Oriental garb  contrasting strangely with his modern surroundings; and, to the amusement  of the assembly, uttered a string of elaborate English words, laughingly  ending, \"Very difficult English words I speak!\" Then, a moment later, with  the swift transition of one who knows both how to be grave and gay, he  showed himself terribly in earnest.    He had left orders that none were to be turned away, but one who had twice  vainly sought his presence, and was, through some oversight, prevented  from seeing him, wrote a heartbreaking letter showing that he thought  himself rebuffed. It was translated by the Persian interpreter.  'Abdu'l-Baha at once put on his coat, and, turning towards the door, said,  with an expression of unspeakable sadness, \"A friend of mine has been  martyred, and I am very grieved. I go out alone.\" and he swept down the  steps. One could then see how well the title of \"Master\" became him.    Another phase of his character which none who saw him could ever forget  was his attitude towards children who were brought to him. Many of his  talks were given as he sat with his arm encircling one of them.    He invariably admonished the parents thus: \"Give this child a good  education; make every effort that it may have the best you can afford, so  that it may be enabled to enjoy the advantage of this glorious age. Do all  you can to encourage spirituality in them.\"    One who sought the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha realized the father-like  sympathy which is his. Speaking of his and others' love for 'Abdu'l-Baha  the reply was: \"I know that you love me, I can see that it is so. I will  pray for you that you may be firm and serve in the Cause, becoming a true  servant to Baha'u'llah. Though I go away I will always be present with you  all.\" These words were spoken with the greatest loving sympathy and  understanding of difficulties; during the moments of this little talk  'Abdu'l-Baha held and stroked the speaker's hands, and at the end took his  head and with a gentle touch drew it to him kissing the forehead of the  young man, who felt that he had found a father and a friend.            THE FAREWELL      On the last morning of 'Abdu'l-Baha's stay in London many friends gathered  both at Cadogan Gardens and at the station to bid him farewell. An  impressive and interesting ceremony was performed at the house by a  Zoroastrian (a physician), who sent an elaborate telegram to some Parsis  in Bombay, saying: \"The Torch of Truth has been lighted again in the East  and the West by 'Abdu'l-Baha.\" Instructed by his brethren, this follower  of one of the most ancient religions in the world had brought with him a  sacred oil of a rare perfume, with which he anointed the head and breast  of 'Abdu'l-Baha, afterwards touching the hands of all present. He then  placed around 'Abdu'l-Baha's neck and shoulders an exquisite garland of  rose-buds and lilies.

You may be sure he will pray for your success, With Baha'i greetings, R.  Rabbani          (66) June 27th, 1957      Secretary, National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of New Zealand.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to write you on his behalf and  assure you he was most happy to receive your letter dated May 4.    He rejoices with the New Zealand Baha'is in the formation of their  historic National Assembly. They are now firmly launched on the course of  their own destiny, and undoubtedly the Faith will go forward very much  faster. They have an advantage not shared by many of their fellow National  Assemblies, of exclusively administering the affairs of the Faith in a  small area, which means that they can function much more efficiently. When  one remembers the many years that the New Zealand and Australian believers  toiled to carry on the work in those two countries, with the sea in  between, and inadequate funds to provide transportation, which  necessitated so much of the National Assembly's work being carried on by  correspondence, one can appreciate the advantages you now enjoy.    The formation of a new National Body in any case is an organic thing, and  a new and lively flow of life will go out into all the members of the  Community from this Assembly.    As regards the question you asked him about the site for the Temple, this  need not be a large piece of land at this time--three or four acres would  be sufficient for the site if you find suitable land is expensive. If the  worst comes to the worst, when the time comes to build the Temple, the  site can be changed. In Uganda some years ago, they purchased a Temple  site, and later, a large piece of land for their endowment. With the  Guardian's permission, they exchanged the two as the Endowment's position  was better for the Temple. So you see, it need not be too rigid. The point  is to get a Temple site as soon as possible. He feels it should be in the  outskirts of Auckland, within easy motoring distance, so that the friends  can attend services there. Naturally the closer to the city, the better.    As you formulate your plans and carry them out for the work entrusted to  you during the next six years, he wishes you to particularly bear in mind  the need of teaching the Maoris. These original discoverers of New Zealand  are of a very fine race, and they are a people long admired for their  noble qualities; and special effort should be made, not only to contact  the Maoris in the cities and draw them into the Faith, but to go to their  towns and live amongst them and establish Assemblies in which at least the  majority of the believers will be Maoris, if not all. This would be indeed  a worthy achievement.    The beloved Guardian assures you all of his prayers for the success of the  historic work you are now undertaking, and he feels sure you will achieve  your goals.    With warmest Baha'i greetings,  Ruhiyyih    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear and valued co-workers:_    _The emergence of the New Zealand National Spiritual Assembly, as a result  of the convocation of the first Baha'i historic Convention held in that  far-away and promising Dominion, will be hailed by posterity as an event  of the greatest significance, marking the erection of another pillar  designed to support, in the South Pacific area, the future Universal House  of Justice. My heart overflows with happiness and is filled with gratitude  as I contemplate the splendid progress achieved, in recent years, in that  far-off island, and note the loyalty and devotion with which the members  of this valiant community, now standing on the threshold of unprecedented  achievements, have discharged their manifold and sacred responsibilities._    _The six brief years that now lie ahead must witness a swift expansion in  the scope of Baha'i activities throughout the length and breadth of that  Dominion, as well as a steady consolidation of the foundations of the  institutions that have been so painstakingly laid. The Six-Year Plan upon  which the New Zealand believers have now so auspiciously embarked must be  diligently prosecuted and brought to a triumphant conclusion. All must  participate, whether young or old, veterans as well as newly enrolled  believers, all must contribute their share to the ultimate success of this  mighty collective enterprise, however limited their means, however modest  their abilities, however restricted the range of their previous  experiences._    _The increase in the number of the avowed adherents of the Faith; the  multiplication of isolated centres, groups, and local assemblies; the  incorporation of the newly formed National Spiritual Assembly as well as  all firmly grounded local assemblies; the recognition of the Baha'i  marriage certificate by the civil authorities, and of the Baha'i Holy Days  by the Superintendent of schools in that island; the rapid conversion of  the Maoris and their close association with the white believers in the  administration of the affairs of the community; the consolidation of the  work energetically initiated in the South Island; the selection and  purchase of the site for the Mother Temple of New Zealand--these stand out  as the foremost objectives of the Plan now demanding of its high minded  determined prosecutors, the utmost consecration, unrelaxing vigilance and  the noblest self-sacrifice._    _The tasks, challenging the spirit and resources of this community, whose  numerical strength is as yet so limited, whose material resources are so  circumscribed, whose past experiences have, in many respects, been  confined to a narrow range, are truly formidable. The alloted time, during  which so stupendous an undertaking is to be consummated, is short. The  obstacles confronting its members are varied and manifold. Yet the  sustaining grace promised to all those who will arise, with  single-mindedness, courage, dedication and high resolve to aid in the  attainment of these noble objectives, is of such potency that no earthly  power can resist the ultimate fulfilment of so glorious a task, or even  delay its eventual fruition._    _I appeal most earnestly to all those who, in both the teaching and  administrative fields, are committed to carry out so magnificent an  enterprise, as well as to those who, in an unofficial capacity, are called  upon to further, by every means in their power, the interests of this  epoch-making Plan, to dedicate themselves, at this hour to the arduous,  yet infinitely precious task they have shouldered, and to devote, in the  days and years that lie ahead, every ounce of their energy to the  systematic prosecution of a Plan, on which the immediate destinies of the  entire New Zealand Baha'i community directly depend; and which can alone  provide the stepping-stone to the still more brilliant achievements  destined to ennoble the annals of the Faith in that remote island of the  globe._    _Shoghi_          (67) July 19th, 1957      Secretary, National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia.    Dear Baha'i Brother:    ...As regards the \"Herald of the South\" magazine, in view of the important  work lying ahead of your Assembly, and the fact that this magazine is a  drain on the limited resources of the Community, he thinks it would be  quite all right to suspend publication until a future date when the  financial situation permits such expenditures to be made with relative  ease. He leaves, however, the final decision to your Assembly.    The Committee responsible for the publication of this magazine has  certainly laboured valiantly throughout the years, and the publication  will be missed by its readers. However, it is some years since the  American Baha'i Magazine was abandoned for similar reasons, and the  Guardian feels that you can do so in Australia, and the funds be used to  better advantage, at this time. However, now that you have found a printer  in Sydney and appointed a new committee, he thinks you should continue it  and give the new Plan a try....    The successful culmination of the long standing partnership of the  Australian and New Zealand believers thru the emergence of the New Zealand  N. S. A. is a source of great satisfaction to the Guardian, and no doubt  to all the members of both communities. He feels sure this will mark a  turning point in the work in the Antipodes and the neighbouring islands  and give a new lease of life to the teaching work throughout that area.  Both your Assembly and that of New Zealand have now emerged into your  permanent form as pillars of the future International House of Justice.  The bones of the skeleton of the World Order are growing strong, but only  the teaching work can clothe them with flesh....    [From the Guardian:]    _Dear and valued co-workers:_    _...Particularly commendable, and indeed exemplary, has been the share of  the Australian believers in enabling the New-Zealand Baha'i Community to  make such rapid strides, in recent years, strides that have prepared it  for the assumption of its sacred and vital function as an independent  community, and which culminated in the formation of a body qualified to  take its place, and assume the weighty responsibilities incumbent on it,  as a distinct and separate member of the world-wide family of Baha'i  national and regional Spiritual Assemblies...._    (Extract, ibid., pp. 135, 137, 138)          (68) August 30th, 1957      Secretary, Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the City of Auckland.    Dear Baha'i Friends:    This is just a brief note, on behalf of the beloved Guardian, to  acknowledge your letter of July 5th (8th Rahmat, 114) and tell you he  appreciates your action in sending the cable to Iran, and assure you of  his loving prayers for the rapid progress of the Faith in Auckland.
