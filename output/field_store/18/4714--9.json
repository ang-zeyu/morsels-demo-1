Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, \"How many years  have you lived?\" Jacob answered, \"I have lived a hundred and thirty  years; few and evil have been the years of my life, and they have not  been as many as those that my forefathers lived on earth.\" After Jacob  had blessed Pharaoh, he went out from Pharaoh's presence. So Joseph gave  his father and his brothers a place to live in and a home in the land of  Goshen, in the best part of the land of Egypt, as Pharaoh had commanded.    Joseph also provided food for his father and his brothers and all his  father's family according to the number of the little children. So the  Israelites lived in Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and there they grew  wealthy and had many children.      THE BOYHOOD AND TRAINING OF MOSES    After the death of Joseph and his brothers, the Israelites increased so  rapidly and became so many and powerful that the land was filled with  them. But a new king who did not know Joseph ruled over Egypt. He said  to his people, \"See, the Israelites are becoming too many and powerful  for us. Come, let us deal wisely with them, for fear that they become so  many that, if war is begun against us, they will join our enemies and  fight against us and leave the land.\"    So the Egyptians set taskmasters over them to put burdens upon them. And  they built for Pharaoh the store-cities, Pithom and Rameses. But the  more the Egyptians afflicted them, the more numerous they became and the  more they spread everywhere, so that the Egyptians dreaded what they  might do. And the Egyptians were cruel and made slaves of them, making  their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and brick, and by all kinds  of hard work in the field.    Pharaoh also gave this command to all his people, \"You shall throw into  the river every son that is born to the Hebrews, but every daughter you  shall save alive.\"    Now a man of the tribe of Levi married a woman of the same tribe, and  she had a son. When she saw that he was a beautiful child, she hid him  for three months. But when she could no longer hide him, she took a  basket made of papyrus reeds, daubed it with mortar and pitch, and put  the child in it. Then she placed it in the reeds by the bank of the  river Nile, while his sister stayed near by to see what would happen to  him.    The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the Nile, and while her  maids were walking along the river's bank, she saw the basket among the  reeds and sent her waiting-maid to bring it. When she opened it and saw  the child, the boy was crying; and she felt sorry for him and said,  \"This is one of the Hebrew children.\"    Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, \"Shall I go and call one of  the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?\" Pharaoh's daughter said to  her, \"Go.\" So the maiden went and called the child's mother, and  Pharaoh's daughter said to her, \"Take this child away and nurse it for  me, and I will pay you your wages.\" Then the woman took the child and  nursed it. When the child had grown up, she brought him to Pharaoh's  daughter, and he became her son; and she named him Moses, for she said,  \"I drew him out of the water.\"    One time, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his own people; and  as he was watching them at their hard labor, he saw an Egyptian beating  a Hebrew, one of his own race. He looked around and seeing that there  was no one in sight, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.    On the next day Moses went out, and saw two Hebrews struggling together;  and he said to the one who was in the wrong, \"Why do you strike your  fellow workman?\" The man replied, \"Who made you a ruler and a judge over  us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?\" Then Moses was  afraid and said, \"What I have done is known!\" When Pharaoh heard what  had taken place, he tried to put Moses to death; but Moses left the  country and made his home in the land of Midian.    As he was sitting by a well, the seven daughters of the priest of Midian  came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's  flock, but the shepherds came and drove them away. Then Moses stood up  and protected the women and watered their flock.    When they came to their father, he said, \"How is it that you have come  back so early to-day?\" They replied, \"An Egyptian protected us from the  shepherds, and besides, he drew water for us and watered the flock.\"  Then he said to his daughters, \"Where is he? Why have you left the man?  Ask him to eat with us.\" So Moses made his home with the man; and he  gave Moses his daughter Zipporah to be his wife. She had a son, and  Moses named him Gershom.      THE VOICE FROM THE BUSH    After a long time the king of Egypt died. Moses was taking care of the  flock of Jethro his wife's father. Once he led the flock to the other  side of the pasture and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. There the  angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a  thorn bush. As he looked, the bush flamed up without being burned. Moses  said, \"I will stop here and see this wonderful sight, why the bush is  not burned up.\"    [Illustration: _The Finding of Moses_    Painted by Juliaan de Vriendt]    When Jehovah saw that Moses stopped to look, he called to him from the  midst of the bush, \"Moses, Moses.\" Moses answered, \"Here am I.\" Then God  said, \"Do not come near; take your shoes off your feet, for the place  where you are standing is holy ground.\" He also said, \"I am the God of  your forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of  Jacob.\" Then Moses covered his face; for he was afraid to look upon  God.    But Jehovah said, \"I have certainly seen the suffering of my people who  are in Egypt and have heard their cry of distress because of their  taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. I have come down to rescue them  from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them out of that land into  a land that is beautiful and wide, to a land with plenty of milk and  honey. I have heard the cry of the Israelites and I have seen how they  suffer at the hands of the Egyptians. Come now, I will send you to  Pharaoh that you may bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.\"    But Moses said to God, \"Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and should  bring the Israelites out of Egypt?\" He answered, \"I will surely be with  you; and this shall be the sign to you that I have sent you: when you  have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God upon this  mountain.\"    Then Moses said to God, \"If I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The  God of your forefathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is  his name?' what shall I answer them?\" God said to Moses, \"I AM WHAT I  AM\"; and he said, \"Declare to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'  Go and gather the leaders of Israel together and say to them, 'Jehovah  the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has  appeared to me and said, I have surely remembered you and have seen what  is being done to you in Egypt, and I have declared that I will bring you  up out of the suffering in Egypt to a land with plenty of milk and  honey.' They will listen to your voice; and you, together with the  leaders of Israel, shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him,  'Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, has appeared to us. Now let us go  three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may offer a sacrifice  to Jehovah our God.' But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you  go unless he is made to do so by a mighty power. Therefore I will use my  power and overwhelm Egypt with all the marvellous deeds that I will do  there. After that he will let you go.\"    Moses said to Jehovah, \"O, Lord I am not able to speak well; for I am  slow to speak and slow in saying what I think.\" Jehovah said to him,  \"Who has given man a mouth? Or who makes one deaf or dumb, or blind or  able to see? Is it not I, Jehovah? Now go, and I will be with you and  teach you what you shall say; and your brother Aaron shall speak for you  to the people.\"    Then Moses went back to Jethro, his wife's father, and said to him,  \"Let me go again to my people in Egypt to see whether they are still  alive.\" Jethro answered Moses, \"Go, with my blessing.\"      PHARAOH THE STUBBORN RULER    Then Jehovah said to Aaron, \"Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.\" So  he went and met him on the mountain of God and kissed him. And Moses  told Aaron all that Jehovah had sent him to declare. So Moses and Aaron  gathered all the leaders of the Israelites, and Aaron repeated all the  words which Jehovah had spoken to Moses. The people believed; and when  they heard that Jehovah had remembered the Israelites and that he had  seen their suffering, they bowed their heads and worshipped.    Then Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, \"Jehovah, the God  of Israel commands, 'Let my people go that they may hold a feast in my  honor in the wilderness.'\" But Pharaoh said, \"Who is Jehovah that I  should obey his command to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah, and I  will not let Israel go.\" They said, \"The God of the Hebrews has appeared  to us; let us go three days' journey into the wilderness that we may  offer a sacrifice to Jehovah our God, that he may not attack us with  pestilence or with the sword.\" But the king of Egypt replied, \"Moses and  Aaron, why do you try to turn the people from their work? Go to your  tasks!\"    The same day Pharaoh gave this command to the taskmasters who were over  the people: \"You shall no longer give the people straw for making bricks  as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. But you shall  demand of them the same number of bricks that they have been making  before; you "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23593"],[0,"Lectures on Architecture and Painting, Delivered at Edinburgh in November 1853 (#12)"],[1," a simple natural form before him, and tell him to copy it, we are sure  we have given him a wholesome and useful piece of education; but if we  told him to paint it, he might, with all the honesty in the world, paint  it wrongly and falsely, to the end of his days.    49. So much for the workman. But the workman is not the only person  concerned. Observe farther, that when you buy a print, the enjoyment of  it is confined to yourself and to your friends. But if you carve a piece  of stone, and put it on the outside of your house, it will give pleasure  to every person who passes along the street--to an innumerable  multitude, instead of a few.    Nay, but, you say, we ourselves shall not be benefited by the sculpture  on the outsides of our houses. Yes, you will, and in an extraordinary  degree; for, observe farther, that architecture differs from painting  peculiarly in being an art of _accumulation_. The prints bought by your  friends, and hung up in their houses, have no collateral effect with  yours: they must be separately examined, and if ever they were hung side  by side, they would rather injure than assist each other's effect. But  the sculpture on your friend's house unites in effect with that on your  own. The two houses form one grand mass--far grander than either  separately; much more if a third be added--and a fourth; much more if  the whole street--if the whole city--join in the solemn harmony of  sculpture. Your separate possessions of pictures and prints are to you  as if you sang pieces of music with your single voices in your own  houses. But your architecture would be as if you all sang together in  one mighty choir. In the separate picture, it is rare that there exists  any very high source of sublime emotion; but the great concerted music  of the streets of the city, when turret rises over turret, and casement  frowns beyond casement, and tower succeeds to tower along the farthest  ridges of the inhabited hills,--this is a sublimity of which you can at  present form no conception; and capable, I believe, of exciting almost  the deepest emotion that art can ever strike from the bosoms of men.    And justly the deepest: for it is a law of God and of Nature, that your  pleasures--as your virtues--shall be enhanced by mutual aid. As, by  joining hand in hand, you can sustain each other best, so, hand in hand,  you can delight each other best. And there is indeed a charm and  sacredness in street architecture which must be wanting even to that of  the temple: it is a little thing for men to unite in the forms of a  religious service, but it is much for them to unite, like true brethren,  in the arts and offices of their daily lives.    50. And now, I can conceive only of one objection as likely still to  arise in your minds, which I must briefly meet. Your pictures, and other  smaller works of art, you can carry with you, wherever you live; your  house must be left behind. Indeed, I believe that the wandering habits  which have now become almost necessary to our existence, lie more at the  root of our bad architecture than any other character of modern times.  We always look upon our houses as mere temporary lodgings. We are always  hoping to get larger and finer ones, or are forced, in some way or  other, to live where we do not choose, and in continual expectation of  changing our place of abode. In the present state of society, this is in  a great measure unavoidable; but let us remember it is an _evil_; and  that so far as it _is_ avoidable, it becomes our duty to check the  impulse. It is not for me to lead you at present into any consideration  of a matter so closely touching your private interests and feelings; but  it surely is a subject for serious thought, whether it might not be  better for many of us, if, on attaining a certain position in life, we  determined, with God's permission, to choose a home in which to live and  die,--a home not to be increased by adding stone to stone and field to  field, but which, being enough for all our wishes at that period, we  should resolve to be satisfied with forever. Consider this; and also,  whether we ought not to be more in the habit of seeking honor from our  descendants than our ancestors; thinking it better to be nobly  remembered than nobly born; and striving so to live, that our sons, and  our sons' sons, for ages to come, might still lead their children  reverently to the doors out of which we had been carried to the grave,  saying, \"Look: This was his house: This was his chamber.\"    51. I believe that you can bring forward no other serious objection to  the principles for which I am pleading. They are so simple, and, it  seems to me, so incontrovertible, that I trust you will not leave this  room, without determining, as you have opportunity, to do something to  advance this long-neglected art of domestic architecture. The reasons I  have laid before you would have weight, even were I to ask you to go to  some considerable expenditure beyond what you at present are accustomed  to devote to such purposes; but nothing more would be needed than the  diversion of expenditures, at present scattered and unconsidered, into a  single and effective channel. Nay, the mere interest of the money which  we are accustomed to keep dormant by us in the form of plate and  jewelry, would alone be enough to sustain a school of magnificent  architecture. And although, in highly wrought plate, and in finely  designed jewelry, noble art may occasionally exist, yet in general both  jewels and services of silver are matters of ostentation, much more than  sources of intellectual pleasure. There are also many evils connected  with them--they are a care to their possessors, a temptation to the  dishonest, and a trouble and bitterness to the poor. So that I cannot  but think that part of the wealth which now lies buried in these  doubtful luxuries, might most wisely and kindly be thrown into a form  which would give perpetual pleasure, not to its possessor only, but to  thousands besides, and neither tempt the unprincipled, nor inflame the  envious, nor mortify the poor; while, supposing that your own dignity  was dear to you, this, you may rely upon it, would be more impressed  upon others by the nobleness of your house-walls than by the glistening  of your sideboards.    [Illustration: PLATE XII. (Fig. 19.)]    52. And even supposing that some additional expenditure _were_ required  for this purpose, are we indeed so much poorer than our ancestors, that  we cannot now, in all the power of Britain, afford to do what was done  by every small republic, by every independent city, in the Middle Ages,  throughout France, Italy, and Germany? I am not aware of a vestige of  domestic architecture, belonging to the great mediaeval periods, which,  according to its material and character, is not richly decorated. But  look here (_fig._ 19), look to what an extent decoration _has_ been  carried in the domestic edifices of a city, I suppose not much superior  in importance, commercially speaking, to Manchester, Liverpool, or  Birmingham--namely, Rouen, in Normandy. This is a _garret_ window, still  existing there,--a garret window built by William de Bourgtheroude in  the early part of the sixteenth century. I show it you, first, as a  proof of what may be made of the features of domestic buildings we are  apt to disdain; and secondly, as another example of a beautiful use of  the pointed arch, filled by the solid shield of stone, and inclosing a  square casement. It is indeed a peculiarly rich and beautiful instance,  but it is a type of which many examples still exist in France, and of  which many once existed in your own Scotland, of ruder work indeed, but  admirable always in the effect upon the outline of the building.[18]    [Footnote 18: One of the most beautiful instances I know of this kind of  window is in the ancient house of the Maxwells, on the estate of Sir  John Maxwell of Polloc. I had not seen it when I gave this lecture, or I  should have preferred it, as an example, to that of Rouen, with  reference to modern possibilities of imitation.]    53. I do not, however, hope that you will often be able to go as far as  this in decoration; in fact I would rather recommend a simpler style to  you, founded on earlier examples; but, if possible, aided by color,  introduced in various kinds of naturally colored stones. I have  observed that your Scottish lapidaries have admirable taste and skill in  the disposition of the pebbles of your brooches and other ornaments of  dress; and I have not the least doubt that the genius of your country  would, if directed to this particular style of architecture, produce  works as beautiful as they would be thoroughly national. The Gothic of  Florence, which owes at least the half of its beauty to the art of  inlaying, would furnish you with exquisite examples; its sculpture is  indeed the most perfect which was ever produced by the Gothic schools;  but, besides this rich sculpture, all its flat surfaces are inlaid with  colored stones, much being done with a green serpentine, which forms the  greater part of the coast of Genoa. You have, I believe, large beds of  this rock in Scotland, and other stones besides, peculiarly Scottish,  calculated to form as noble a school of color as ever existed.[19]    [Footnote 19: A series of four examples of designs for windows was  exhibited at this point of the lecture, but I have not engraved them, as  they were hastily made for the purposes of momentary illustration, and  are not such as I choose to publish or perpetuate.]    54. And, now, I have but two things more to say to you in conclusion.    Most of the lecturers whom you allow to address you, lay before you  views of the sciences they profess, which are either generally received,  or incontrovertible. I come before you at a disadvantage; for I cannot  conscientiously tell you anything about architecture but what is at"]]]
