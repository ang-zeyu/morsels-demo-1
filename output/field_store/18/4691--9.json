You ought to carry a compass if you're  going to be a sailor.\"    Tom was beginning to think so himself and wondered that he had not  thought of it before.  He found the one the hunter had, and placing it  on the seat near him, he carefully listened to the wounded man's  directions.  Tom easily comprehended and soon had the boat headed in  the proper direction.  After that it was comparatively easy to keep on  the right course, even in the fog.    But there was another danger, however, and this was that he might run  into another boat.  True, there were not many on Lake Carlopa, but  there were some, and one of the few motor-boats might be out in spite  of the bad weather.    \"Guess I'll not run at full speed,\" decided Tom.  \"I wouldn't like to  crash into the RED STREAK.  We'd both sink.\"    So he did not run his motor at the limit and sat at the steering-wheel,  peering ahead into the fog for the first sight of another craft.    He turned to look at Mr. Duncan and was alarmed at the pallor of his  face.  The man's eyes were closed and he was breathing in a peculiar  manner.    \"Mr. Duncan,\" cried Tom, \"are you worse?\"    There was no answer.  Leaving the helm for a moment, Tom bent over the  injured hunter.  A glance showed him what had happened.  The tourniquet  had slipped and the wound was bleeding again.  Tom quickly shut off the  motor, so that he might give his whole attention to the work of  tightening the handkerchief.  But something seemed to be wrong.  No  matter how tightly he twisted the stick the blood did not stop flowing.  The lad was frightened.  In a short time the man would bleed to death.    \"I've got to get him to the sanitarium in record time!\"  exclaimed Tom.  \"Fog or no fog, I've got to run at full speed!  I've got to chance it!\"    Making the bandage as tight as he could and fastening it in place, the  young inventor sprang to the motor and set it in motion.  Then he went  to the wheel.  In a few minutes the ARROW was speeding through the  water as it had never done before, except when it had raced the RED  STREAK.  \"If I hit anything--good-by!\"  thought Tom grimly.  His hands  were tense on the rim of the steering-wheel and he was ready in an  instant to reverse the motor as he sat there straining his eyes to see  through the curtain of mist that hung over the lake.  Now and then he  glanced at the compass, to keep on the right course, and from time to  time he looked at Mr. Duncan.  The hunter was still unconscious.    How Tom accomplished that trip he hardly remembered afterward.  Through  the fog he shot, expecting any moment to crash into some other boat.  He did pass a rowing craft in which sat a lone fisherman.  The lad was  upon him in an instant, but a turn of the wheel sent the ARROW safely  past, and the startled fisherman, whose frail craft was set to rocking  violently by the swell from the motor-boat, sent an objecting cry  through the fog after Tom.  But the youth did not reply.  On and on he  raced, getting the last atom of power from his motor.    He feared Mr. Duncan would be dead when he arrived, but when he saw the  dock of the sanitarium looming up out of the mist and shut off the  power to slowly run up to it, he placed his hand on the wounded man's  heart and found it still beating.    \"He's alive, anyhow,\" thought the youth, and then his craft bumped up  against the bulkhead and a man in the boathouse on the dock was sent on  the run for a physician.    Mr. Duncan was quickly taken up to the sanitarium on a stretcher and  Tom followed.    \"You must have made a record run,\" observed one of the physicians a  little while afterward, when Tom was telling of his trip while waiting  in the office to hear the report on the hunter's condition.    \"I guess I did,\" muttered the young inventor \"only I didn't think so at  the time.  It seemed as if we were only crawling along.\"          CHAPTER XII    SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS      Under the skill of the physicians at the lake sanitarium Mr. Duncan's  wound was quickly attended to and the bleeding, which Tom had partly  checked, was completely stopped.  Some medicines having been  administered, the hunter regained a little of his strength, and, about  an hour after he had been brought to the resort, he was able to see  Tom, who, at his request, was admitted to his room.  The young inventor  found Mr. Duncan propped up in bed, with his injured arm bandaged.    \"Is the injury a bad one?\"  asked Tom, entering softly.    \"Not as bad as I feared,\" replied the hunter, while a trained nurse  placed a chair for the lad at the bedside.  \"If it had not been for  you, though, I'm afraid to think of what might have happened.\"    \"I am glad I chanced to be going past when you called,\" replied the lad.    \"Well, you can imagine how thankful I am,\" resumed Mr. Duncan.  \"I'll  thank you more properly at another time.  I hope I didn't delay you on  your trip.\"    \"It's not of much consequence,\" responded the youth.  \"I was only going  to see that everything was all right at our house,\" and he explained  about his father being at the hotel and mentioned his worriment.  \"I  will go on now unless I can do something more for you,\" resumed Tom.  \"I will probably stay at our house all night to-night instead of trying  to get back to Sandport.\"    \"I'd like to send word to my wife about what has happened,\" said the  hunter.  \"If it would not be too much out of your way, I'd appreciate  it if you could stop at my home in Waterford and tell her, so she will  not be alarmed at my absence.\"    \"I'll do it,\" replied our hero.  \"There is no special need of my  hurrying.  I have brought your gun and compass up from the boat.  They  are down in the office.\"    \"Will you do me a favor?\"  asked Mr. Duncan quickly.    \"Of course.\"    \"Then please accept that gun and compass with my compliments.  They are  both of excellent make, and I don't think I shall use that gun this  season.  My wife would be superstitious about it.  As for the compass,  you'll need one in this fog, and I can recommend mine as being  accurate.\"    \"Oh, I couldn't think of taking them,\" expostulated Tom, but his eyes  sparkled in anticipation, for he had been wishing for a gun such as Mr.  Duncan owned.  He also needed a compass.    \"If you don't take them I shall feel very much offended,\" the hunter  said, \"and the nurse here will tell you that sick persons ought to be  humored.  Hadn't they?\"  and he appealed to the pretty young woman, who  was smiling at Tom.    \"That's perfectly true,\" she said, showing her white, even teeth.  \"I  think, Mr. Swift, I shall have to order you to take them.\"    \"All right,\" agreed Tom, \"only it's too much for what I did.\"    \"It isn't half enough,\" remarked Mr. Duncan solemnly.  \"Just explain  matters to my wife, if you will, and tell her the doctor says I can be  out in about a week.  But I'm not going hunting or practicing shots  again.\"    A little later Tom, with the compass before him to guide him on his  course through the fog, was speeding his boat toward Waterford.  Now  and then he glanced at the fine shotgun which he had so unexpectedly  acquired.    \"This will come in handy this fall!\"  he exclaimed.  \"I'll go hunting  quail and partridge as well as wild ducks.  This compass is just what I  need, too.\"    Mrs. Duncan was at first very much alarmed when Tom started to tell her  of the accident, but she soon calmed down as the lad went more into  details and stated how comparatively out of danger her husband now was.  The hunter's wife insisted that Tom remain to dinner, and as he had  made up his mind he would have to devote two days instead of one to the  trip to his house, he consented.    The fog lifted that afternoon, and Tom, rejoicing in the sunlight,  which drove away the storm clouds, speeded up the ARROW until she was  skimming over the lake like a shaft from a bow.    \"This is something like,\" he exclaimed.  \"I'll soon be at home, find  everything all right and telephone to dad.  Then I'll sleep in my own  room and start back in the morning.\"    When Tom was within a few miles of his own boathouse he heard behind  him the \"put-put\"  of a motor craft.  Turning, he saw the RED STREAK  fairly flying along at some distance from him.    \"Andy certainly is getting the speed out of her now,\" he remarked.  \"He'd beat me if we were racing, but the trouble with his boat and  engine is that he can't always depend on it.  I guess he doesn't  understand how to run it.  I wonder if he'll offer to race now?\"    But the red-haired owner of the auto boat evidently did not intend to  offer Tom a race.  The RED STREAK went on down the lake, passing the  ARROW about half a mile away.  Then the young inventor saw that Andy  had two other lads in the boat with him.    \"Sam Snedecker and Pete Bailey, I guess,\" he murmured.  \"Well, they're  a trio pretty much alike.  The farther off they are the better I like  it.\"    Tom once more gave his attention to his own boat.  He was going at a  fair speed, but not the limit, and he counted on reaching home in about  a half hour.  Suddenly, when he was just congratulating himself on the  smooth-running qualities of his motor, which had not missed an  explosion, the machinery stopped.    \"Hello!\"  exclaimed the young inventor in some alarm.  \"What's up now?\"    He quickly shut off the gasoline and went back to the motor.  Now there  are so many things that may happen to a gasoline engine that it would  be difficult to name them all offhand, and Tom, who had not had very  much experience, was at a loss to find what had stopped his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22748"],[0,"Explanation of Terms Used in Entomology (#12)"],[1,"rated.
