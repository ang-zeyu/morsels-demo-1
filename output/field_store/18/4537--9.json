He had suspected her for some considerable time,  and had not only kept secret the birth of her son but had secluded  the child from the mother. No heir resulting from his second marriage,  however, the son of Mirza became Baron Lashmore, and after death  became what his mother had been before him.    \"Lord Lashmore, the curse of the house of Dhoon will prevail until the  Polish Jewess who originated it has been treated as her son was  treated!\"    \"Dr. Cairn, it is not known where her husband had her body concealed.  He died without revealing the secret. Do you mean that the taint, the  devil's taint, may recur--Oh, my God! do you want to drive me mad?\"    \"I do not mean that after so many generations which have been free  from it, the vampirism will arise again in your blood; but I mean that  the spirit, the unclean, awful spirit of that vampire woman, is still  earth-bound. The son was freed, and with him went the hereditary  taint, it seems; but the mother was _not_ freed! Her body was  decapitated, but her vampire soul cannot go upon its appointed course  until the ancient ceremonial has been performed!\"    Lord Lashmore passed his hand across his eyes.    \"You daze me, Dr. Cairn. In brief, what do you mean?\"    \"I mean that the spirit of Mirza is to this day loose upon the world,  and is forced, by a deathless, unnatural longing to seek incarnation  in a human body. It is such awful pariahs as this, Lord Lashmore, that  constitute the danger of so-called spiritualism. Given suitable  conditions, such a spirit might gain control of a human being.\"    \"Do you suggest that the spirit of the second lady--\"    \"It is distinctly possible that she haunts her descendants. I seem to  remember a tradition of Dhoon Castle, to the effect that births and  deaths are heralded by a woman's mocking laughter?\"    \"I, myself, heard it on the night--I became Lord Lashmore.\"    \"That is the spirit who was known, in life, as Mirza, Lady Lashmore!\"    \"But--\"    \"It is possible to gain control of such a being.\"    \"By what means?\"    \"By unhallowed means; yet there are those who do not hesitate to  employ them. The danger of such an operation is, of course, enormous.\"    \"I perceive, Dr. Cairn, that a theory, covering the facts of my recent  experiences, is forming in your mind.\"    \"That is so. In order that I may obtain corroborative evidence, I  should like to call at your place this evening. Suppose I come  ostensibly to see Lady Lashmore?\"    Lord Lashmore was watching the speaker.    \"There is someone in my household whose suspicions you do not wish to  arouse?\" he suggested.    \"There is. Shall we make it nine o'clock?\"    \"Why not come to dinner?\"    \"Thanks all the same, but I think it would serve my purpose better if  I came later.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Cairn and his son dined alone together in Half-Moon Street that  night.    \"I saw Antony Ferrara in Regent Street to-day,\" said. Robert Cairn. \"I  was glad to see him.\"    Dr. Cairn raised his heavy brows.    \"Why?\" he asked.    \"Well, I was half afraid that he might have left London.\"    \"Paid a visit to Myra Duquesne in Inverness?\"    \"It would not have surprised me.\"    \"Nor would it have surprised me, Rob, but I think he is stalking other  game at present.\"    Robert Cairn looked up quickly.    \"Lady Lashmore,\" he began--    \"Well?\" prompted his father.    \"One of the Paul Pry brigade who fatten on scandal sent a veiled  paragraph in to us at _The Planet_ yesterday, linking Ferrara's name  with Lady Lashmores.' Of course we didn't use it; he had come to the  wrong market; but--Ferrara was with Lady Lashmore when I met him  to-day.\"    \"What of that?\"    \"It is not necessarily significant, of course; Lord Lashmore in all  probability will outlive Ferrara, who looked even more pallid than  usual.\"    \"You regard him as an utterly unscrupulous fortune-hunter?\"    \"Certainly.\"    \"Did Lady Lashmore appear to be in good health?\"    \"Perfectly.\"    \"Ah!\"    A silence fell, of some considerable duration, then:    \"Antony Ferrara is a menace to society,\" said Robert Cairn. \"When I  meet the reptilian glance of those black eyes of his and reflect upon  what the man has attempted--what he has done--my blood boils. It is  tragically funny to think that in our new wisdom we have abolished the  only laws that could have touched him! He could not have existed in  Ancient Chaldea, and would probably have been burnt at the stake even  under Charles II.; but in this wise twentieth century he dallies in  Regent Street with a prominent society beauty and laughs in the face  of a man whom he has attempted to destroy!\"    \"Be very wary,\" warned Dr. Cairn. \"Remember that if you died  mysteriously to-morrow, Ferrara would be legally immune. We must wait,  and watch. Can you return here to-night, at about ten o'clock?\"    \"I think I can manage to do so--yes.\"    \"I shall expect you. Have you brought up to date your record of those  events which we know of, together with my notes and explanations?\"    \"Yes, sir, I spent last evening upon the notes.\"    \"There may be something to add. This record, Rob, one day will be a  weapon to destroy an unnatural enemy. I will sign two copies to-night  and lodge one at my bank.\"          CHAPTER X    THE LAUGHTER      Lady Lashmore proved to be far more beautiful than Dr. Cairn had  anticipated. She was a true brunette with a superb figure and eyes  like the darkest passion flowers. Her creamy skin had a golden  quality, as though it had absorbed within its velvet texture something  of the sunshine of the South.    She greeted Dr. Cairn without cordiality.    \"I am delighted to find you looking so well, Lady Lashmore,\" said the  doctor. \"Your appearance quite confirms my opinion.\"    \"Your opinion of what, Dr. Cairn?\"    \"Of the nature of your recent seizure. Sir Elwin Groves invited my  opinion and I gave it.\"    Lady Lashmore paled perceptibly.    \"Lord Lashmore, I know,\" she said, \"was greatly concerned, but indeed  it was nothing serious--\"    \"I quite agree. It was due to nervous excitement.\"    Lady Lashmore held a fan before her face.    \"There have been recent happenings,\" she said--\"as no doubt you are  aware--which must have shaken anyone's nerves. Of course, I am  familiar with your reputation, Dr. Cairn, as a psychical  specialist--?\"    \"Pardon me, but from whom have you learnt of it?\"    \"From Mr. Ferrara,\" she answered simply. \"He has assured me that you  are the greatest living authority upon such matters.\"    Dr. Cairn turned his head aside.    \"Ah!\" he said grimly.    \"And I want to ask you a question,\" continued Lady Lashmore. \"Have you  any idea, any idea at all respecting the cause of the wounds upon my  husband's throat? Do you think them due to--something supernatural?\"    Her voice shook, and her slight foreign accent became more marked.    \"Nothing is supernatural,\" replied Dr. Cairn; \"but I think they are  due to something supernormal. I would suggest that possibly you have  suffered from evil dreams recently?\"    Lady Lashmore started wildly, and her eyes opened with a sort of  sudden horror.    \"How can you know?\" she whispered. \"How can you know! Oh, Dr. Cairn!\"  She laid her hand upon his arm--\"if you can prevent those dreams; if  you can assure me that I shall never dream them again--!\"    It was a plea and a confession. This was what had lain behind her  coldness--this horror which she had not dared to confide in another.    \"Tell me,\" he said gently. \"You have dreamt these dreams twice?\"    She nodded, wide-eyed with wonder for his knowledge.    \"On the occasions of your husband's illnesses?\"    \"Yes, yes!\"    \"What did you dream?\"    \"Oh! can I, dare I tell you!--\"    \"You must.\"    There was pity in his voice.    \"I dreamt that I lay in some very dark cavern. I could hear the sea  booming, apparently over my head. But above all the noise a voice was  audible, calling to me--not by name; I cannot explain in what way; but  calling, calling imperatively. I seemed to be clothed but scantily, in  some kind of ragged garments; and upon my knees I crawled toward the  voice, through a place where there were other living things that  crawled also--things with many legs and clammy bodies....\"    She shuddered and choked down an hysterical sob that was half a laugh.    \"My hair hung dishevelled about me and in some inexplicable way--oh!  am I going mad!--my head seemed to be detached from my living body! I  was filled with a kind of unholy anger which I cannot describe. Also,  I was consumed with thirst, and this thirst....\"    \"I think I understand,\" said Dr. Cairn quietly. \"What followed?\"    \"An interval--quite blank--after which I dreamt again. Dr. Cairn, I  _cannot_ tell you of the dreadful, the blasphemous and foul thoughts,  that then possessed me! I found myself resisting--resisting--something,  some power that was dragging me back to that foul cavern with my thirst  unslaked! I was frenzied; I dare not name, I tremble to think, of the  ideas which filled my mind. Then, again came a blank, and I awoke.\"    She sat trembling. Dr. Cairn noted that she avoided his gaze.    \"You awoke,\" he said, \"on the first occasion, to find that your  husband had met with a strange and dangerous accident?\"    \"There was--something else.\"    Lady Lashmore's voice had become a tremulous whisper.    \"Tell me; don't be afraid.\"    She looked up; her magnificent eyes were wild with horror.    \"I believe you know!\" she breathed. \"Do you?\"    Dr. Cairn nodded.    \"And on the second occasion,\" he said, \"you awoke earlier?\"    Lady Lashmore slightly moved her head.    \"The dream was identical?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Excepting these two occasions, you never dreamt it before?\"    \"I dreamt _part_ of it on several other occasions; or only remembered  part of it on waking.\"    \"Which part?\"    \"The first; that awful cavern--\"    \"And now,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19713"],[0,"The Laughing Prince: Jugoslav Folk and Fairy Tales (#12)"],[1,"had again been stripped of its golden fruit.    He called his three sons to him and said:    \"Is it seemly that a Tsar who has three able-bodied sons should be  robbed night after night of his golden apples? Are you willing that this  should happen and you do nothing about it?\"    The eldest son who was a braggart said:    \"My father, you need say no more. I myself will watch to-night and when  the thief appears I will overpower him and bring him to you.\"    So the eldest son watched that night, standing on guard under the  apple-tree and leaning against its trunk.    As midnight approached his eyes grew heavy and he fell asleep. While he  slept the golden apples ripened and were stolen and the next morning, as  usual, the branches were bare.    The second son who was a crafty youth laughed at his brother and said:    \"To-night I will watch. I will pretend to be asleep and when the thief  appears I will jump upon him and overpower him.\"    So when night came the second son went on guard under the tree and in  order to deceive the thief he lay down on the ground and closed his  eyes. At first he stayed wide awake but as the hours dragged by he grew  tired and then, because he was in such a comfortable position, he too  fell soundly asleep. Midnight came and the apples ripened but the next  morning, when the second prince awoke, the tree had again been stripped  of its golden fruit.    The Tsar's Youngest Son now said:    \"Father, let me go on guard to-night.\"    His brothers jeered and the Tsar shook his head.    \"Nay, nay, my boy, why should you succeed where your older brothers have  failed? It is God's will that my golden apples should be stolen and I  must submit.\"    But the Youngest Son insisted that he, too, be given a chance to capture  the thief and at last the Tsar consented.    \"I will sleep soundly the first part of the night,\" the Youngest Prince  thought to himself, \"and with God's help wake up at midnight.\"    As soon as it was dark he had his bed carried outdoors and placed under  the apple-tree. Then after commending his undertaking to God he lay down  and fell soundly to sleep. Just before midnight he awoke. The apples  had ripened and were shining among the leaves like golden lanterns.    On the stroke of midnight there was a whirr of wings and nine beautiful  peafowl came flying down from the sky. Eight of them settled on the  branches of the apple-tree and began eating the golden fruit. The ninth  alighted beside the Young Prince and as she touched the ground changed  into a lovely maiden.    She was so beautiful and gentle that the Young Prince fell madly in love  with her and at once began wooing her with kisses and caresses. She  responded to his love and they spent the night together in great  happiness.    At the first streak of dawn she jumped up, saying:    \"My dear one, I must leave you now!\"    \"But you will come again, won't you?\" the Prince asked.    \"Yes,\" she promised him. \"To-night.\"    Suddenly the Prince remembered the golden apples. The peafowl in the  tree were about to eat the last of them.    \"Can't you make them leave just one apple for my father?\" the Prince  begged.    The maiden spoke to the birds and they flew down with two of the golden  apples, one for the Tsar and one for the Prince himself.    Then the maiden lifted her arms above her head, changed into a peafowl,  and with the other eight flew off into the morning sky.    The Prince carried the two apples to his father and the Tsar was so  delighted that he forgot to ask the Prince the particulars of his  adventure.    The next night the Prince again slept under the apple-tree and awoke  just before midnight to hear the whirr of wings and see the nine peafowl  come flying down from the sky. Eight of them settled on the branches of  the apple-tree and the ninth, as before, alighted beside him and as she  touched the earth changed into the lovely maiden of his heart. Again  they passed the night together in great happiness and in the early dawn  before she flew away the maiden gave him the last two of the golden  apples.    This went on night after night until the Prince's two elder brothers  were mad with jealousy and consumed with curiosity to know what happened  every night under the apple-tree. At last they went to an evil old woman  and bribed her to spy on the Young Prince.    \"Find out what happens every night at the apple-tree,\" they told her,  \"and we will reward you richly.\"    So the evil old woman hid herself near the apple-tree and that night  when the prince fell asleep she crept under his bed. Midnight came and  she heard the whirr of wings and presently she saw the white feet of a  lovely maiden touch the ground and she heard the prince say: \"My love,  is it you?\"    Then as the Prince and the maiden began kissing each other and  exchanging vows of love very slowly and cautiously she reached up her  hand from under the bed and groped around until she felt the maiden's  hair. Then with a scissors she snipped off a lock.    \"Oh!\" the maiden cried in terror. She jumped up, lifted her arms above  her head, changed into a peafowl, and without another word flew off with  the other eight and vanished in the sky.    In a fury the Prince searched about to see what had frightened his loved  one. He found the old woman under the bed and dragging her out by the  hair he struck her dead with his sword. And good riddance it was, too,  for she was an evil old thing and only caused mischief in the world.    But putting the evil old woman out of the way did not, alas, bring back  the lovely maiden. The Prince waited for her the next night and the next  and many following nights but she nevermore returned.    The magic apple-tree of course was no longer robbed of its golden fruit,  so the Tsar was happy once again and never tired of praising the valor  of his youngest son. But as for the prince, in spite of his father's  praise he grew sadder and sadder.    Finally he went to the Tsar and said:    \"Father, I have lost the maiden whom I love and life without her is not  worth the living. Unless I go out in the world and find her I shall  die.\"    The Tsar tried to dissuade him but when he could not he mounted him on a  fine horse, gave him a serving man to accompany him, and sent him off  with his blessing.    The Prince and his man wandered hither and thither over the world  inquiring everywhere for news of nine peafowl one of whom was a lovely  maiden. They came at last to a lake on the shore of which lived an ugly  old woman with an only daughter.    \"Nine peafowl,\" she repeated, \"and one of them a lovely maiden! You must  mean the nine sisters, the enchanted princesses, who fly about as  peafowl. They come here every morning to bathe in the lake. What can you  want with them?\"    The Prince told the old woman that one of them was his love and that  unless he married her he would die.    \"Die, indeed!\" scoffed the old woman. \"That's no way for a handsome  young man to talk! I'll tell you what you ought to do: give up thought  of this peafowl princess and marry my daughter. Then I'll make you heir  to all my riches.\"    She called out her daughter who was as ugly as herself and cross and  ill-natured in the bargain. Just one look at her and the Prince said  firmly:    \"No! If I can't marry my own dear love I won't marry any one!\"    \"Very well!\" said the old woman shortly.    When the Prince's back was turned she called the serving man aside and  whispered:    \"Will you do what I tell you if I pay you well?\"    The serving man who was a mean greedy fellow nodded his head and the old  woman handed him a small bellows.    \"Hide this in your shirt,\" she told him, \"and don't let your master see  it. Then to-morrow morning when you go down to the lake with him to see  the nine peafowl slip it out and blow it on the back of his neck. Do  this and I'll give you a golden ducat.\"    The serving man took the bellows and did as the old woman directed. The  next morning down at the lake just as the nine peafowl came flying into  sight he crept up behind the Prince and blew the bellows on the back of  his neck. Instantly sleep overcame the Prince. His eyes closed, his head  drooped, and the reins fell from his hands.    Eight of the peafowl alighted on the water's edge, changed into lovely  maidens and went bathing in the lake, but the ninth flew straight down  to the Prince, fluttered her wings in his face and uttering sad cries  tried hard to arouse him.    The eight finished their baths, changed back into birds, and calling  their sister they all flew off together. Then and not till then did the  Prince awaken.    \"Ah!\" he cried, \"how could I have fallen asleep just when the peafowl  appeared? Where are they now? Are they gone?\"    \"Yes,\" his man told him, \"they're gone. Eight of them changed into  lovely maidens and went bathing in the lake but the ninth fluttered  about your head and tried in every way to arouse you. I tried to arouse  you, too, but you kept on sleeping.\"    \"Strange!\" thought the Prince. \"How could I have fallen asleep at such a  time? I'll have to try again to-morrow morning.\"    The next morning the same thing happened. The treacherous serving man  again blew the bellows on the back of the Prince's neck and instantly  the Prince sank into a deep sleep from which the ninth peafowl was  unable to arouse him.    As she rose to join her sisters she said to the serving man:    \"When your master awakens tell him that to-morrow is the last day we  shall come here to bathe in the lake.\"    The peafowl were no sooner gone than the Prince rubbed his eyes and  looked about.    \"What! Where are they? Have I been asleep again?\"    The serving man pretended to be deeply grieved.    \"I tried hard to awaken you, master, but I couldn't. The ninth peafowl  as she flew away said to tell you that to-morrow is the last day they'll  come to the lake.\"    The next day as the Prince waited for the appearance of the nine"]]]
