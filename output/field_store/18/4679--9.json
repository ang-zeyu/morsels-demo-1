How different from Hale's the  treatment bestowed upon Andre, the British spy who fell into our hands.  He was fed from Washington's table, and supported to his execution by  every manifestation of sympathy for his suffering.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  John Paul Jones.      The stanch and useful loyalty of the New England clergy in the  Revolution has been much dwelt upon--none too much, however. With them  should be mentioned the Rev. James Caldwell, Presbyterian pastor at  Elizabeth, N. J., who, when English soldiers raided the town, and its  defenders were short of wadding, tore up his hymn-book for their use,  urging: \"Give them Watts, boys, give them Watts.\"    No fiercer naval battle was ever fought than when Jones, in the old and  rotten Bon Homme Richard, grappled with the new British frigate Serapis.  Yard-arm to yardarm, port-hole to port-hole, the fight raged for hours.  Three times both vessels were on fire. The Serapis's guns tore a  complete breach in the Richard from main-mast to stern. The Richard was  sinking, but the intrepid Jones fought on, and the Serapis struck.      [Illustration: Hand-to-hand fighting; a shell explodes in the  background.]  Fight between the Bon Homme Richard and the Serapis.      As the roll of Revolutionary officers is called, what matchless figures  file past the mind's eye! We see stalwart Ethan Allen entering  Ticonderoga too early in the morning to find its commander in a  presentable condition, and demanding possession \"in the name of Almighty  God and the Continental Congress \"--destined, himself, in a few months,  to be sailing down the St. Lawrence in irons, bound for long captivity  in England. We behold gallant Prescott leisurely promenading the Bunker  Hill parapet to inspirit his men, shot and shell hurtling thick around.  There is Israel Putnam--\"Old Put\" the boys dubbed him. He was no  general, but we forgive his costly blunders at Brooklyn Heights and  Peekskill as we think of him leaving plough in furrow at the drum-beat  to arms, and speeding to the deadly front at Boston, or with iron  firmness stemming the retreat from Bunker Hill. Young Richard Montgomery  might have been next to Washington in the war but for Sir Guy Carleton's  deadly grape-shot from the Quebec walls the closing moments of 1775.  Buried at Quebec, his remains were transferred by the State of New York,  July 8, 1818, to their present resting-place in front of St. Paul's, New  York City, the then aged widow tearfully watching the funeral barge as  it floated past Montgomery Place on the Hudson.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  General Anthony Wayne.      During a four years' apprenticeship under Washington, General Greene had  caught more of his master's spirit and method than did any other  American leader, and one year's separate command at the South gave him a  martial fame second only to Washington's own. In him the great chief's  word was fulfilled, \"I send you a general.\" A naked, starving army, an  empty military chest, the surrounding country impoverished and full of  loyalists--these were his difficulties. Three States practically cleared  of the royal army in ten months--this was his achievement. He retreated  only to advance, was beaten only to fight again. One hardly knows which  to admire most, his tireless energy and vigilance, his prudence in  retreat, his boldness and vigor in attack, his cheerful courage in  defeat, or his mingled kindness and firmness toward a suffering and  mutinous army.    John Stark, eccentric but true, famous for cool courage--how stubbornly,  with his New Hampshire boys, he held the rail fence at Bunker Hill, and  covered the retreat when ammunition was gone! But Stark's most brilliant  deed was at Bennington. \"There they are, boys--the redcoats, and by  night they're ours, or Molly Stark's a widow.\" Those \"boys,\" without  bayonets, their artillery shooting stones for balls, were little more  than a mob. But with confidence in him, on they rush, up, over, sweeping  Baume's Hessians from the field like a tornado. The figure of General  Schuyler comes before us--quieter but not less noble, an invalid, set to  hard tasks with little glory. His magnanimous soul forgets self in  country as he cheerfully gives all possible help to Gates, his  supplanter, and puts the torch to his own grain-fields at Saratoga lest  they feed the foe.      [Illustration: Several soldiers on horseback, fighting with swords and  pistols.]  The Encounter between Tarleton and Colonel Washington.      And matchless Dan Morgan of Virginia, with his band of riflemen, tall,  sinewy fellows, in hunting-shirts, leggins, and moccasins, each with  hatchet, hunter's knife, and rifle, dead sure to hit a man's head every  time at two hundred and fifty yards. It was one of these men who shot  the gallant Briton, Fraser, at Bemis's Heights. Morgan became the ablest  leader of light troops then living. How gallantly he headed the forlorn  hope under the icy walls of Quebec, where he was taken prisoner, and at  Saratoga with his shrill whistle and stentorian voice called his  dauntless braves where the fight was thickest! But Cowpens was Morgan's  crowning feat. Inspiring militia and veterans alike with a courage they  had never felt before, he routs Tarleton's trained band of horse, and  then, skilful in retreat as he had been bold in fight, laughs at baffled  Cornwallis's rage.    Gladly would one form fuller acquaintance with other Revolutionary  leaders: Stirling, Sullivan, Sumter, Mad Anthony Wayne, of Monmouth and  Stony Point fame, Glover with his brave following of  Marblehead  fishermen, who, able to row as well as shoot, manned the oars that  critical night when General Washington crossed to Trenton. But space is  too brief. Colonel Washington, the dashing cavalryman, was the Custer of  the Revolution. All the patriot ladies idolized him. In a hot  sword-fight with the Colonel, Tarleton had had three fingers nearly  severed. Subsequently in conversation with a South Carolina lady  Tarleton said: \"Why do you ladies so lionize Colonel Washington? He is  an ignorant fellow. He can hardly write his name.\" \"But you are a  witness that he can make his mark,\" was the reply.      [Illustration: An officer on horseback looking down at a wounded man  lying on the ground.]  DeKalb Wounded at Camden.      DeKalb was an American, too--by adoption. It is related that he  expostulated with Gates for fighting so unprepared at Camden, and that  Gates intimated cowardice. \"Tomorrow will tell, sir, who is the coward,\"  the old fellow rejoined. And tomorrow did tell. As the battle reddened,  exit Gates from Camden and from fame. We have recounted elsewhere how  like a bull De Kalb held the field. A monster British grenadier rushed  on him, bayonet fixed. DeKalb parried, at the same time burying his  sword in the grenadier's breast so deep that he was unable to extract  it. Then seizing the dead man's weapon he fought on, thrusting right and  left, till at last, overpowered by numbers, he slipped and fell,  mortally hurt.    Among the civilian heroes of the Revolution, Robert Morris, the  financier, deserves exceeding praise. Now turning over the lead ballast  of his ships for bullets, now raising $50,000 on his private credit and  sending it to Washington in the nick of time, now leading the country  back to specie payment in season to save the national credit, the  Philadelphia banker aided the cause as much as the best general in the  field.    Faithful and successful envoys as Jay and John Adams were, the  Revolution brought to light one, and only one, true master in the  difficult art of diplomacy--Franklin. Wise with a lifetime's shrewd  observation, venerable with years, preceded by his fame as scientist and  Revolutionary statesman, grand in his plain dignity, the Philadelphia  printer stood unabashed before the throne of France, and carried king  and diplomats with an art that surprised Europe's best-trained  courtiers. Never missing an opportunity, he yet knew, by delicate  intuition, when to speak and when to hold his tongue. Through  concession, intrigue, and delay, his resolute will kept steady to its  purpose. To please by yielding is easy. To carry one's point and be  pleasing still, requires genius. This Franklin did--how successfully,  our treaty of alliance with France and our treaty of peace with England  splendidly attested.    Towering above Revolutionary soldier, general, and statesman stands a  figure summing up in himself all these characters and much more. That  figure is George Washington, the most perfect human personality the  world has known. Washington's military ability has been much underrated.  He was hardly more First in Peace than First in War. That he had  physical courage and could give orders calmly while bullets whizzed all  about, one need not repeat. He was strategist and tactician too. Trenton  and Yorktown do not cover his whole military record. With troops  inferior in every single respect except natural valor, he  out-generalled Howe in 1776, and he almost never erred when acting upon  his own good judgment instead of yielding to Congress or to his  subordinates. His movements on the Delaware even such a captain as  Frederick the Great declared \"the most brilliant achievements in the  annals of military action.\" Washington advised against the attempt to  hold Fort Washington, which failed; against the Canada campaign, which  failed; against Gates for commander in the South, who failed; and in  favor of Greene for that post, who succeeded. His army was indeed driven  back in several battles, but never broken up. At Monmouth his plan was  perfect, and it seems that he must have captured Clinton but for the  treason of Charles Lee, set, by Congress's wish, to command the van.  Indeed, of Washington's military career, \"take it all in all, its long  duration,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22581"],[0,"The Child-Voice in Singing (#12)"],[1," must, however, be ruthlessly suppressed. As before  suggested, this will frequently appear in words containing the sound of  _a_ as in _at, past, fast_, etc. It is recommended that such words be  sung with _a_ as in _father_, or if not quite as broadly, at least  approaching the sound of _ah_.    If the movements of the vocal organs are quick, flexible and without  muscular tension or stiffness, and if the mouth opens neither too much  nor too little for each vowel-sound, words may be sung and understood  while beauty of tone is not sacrificed.          CHAPTER VII.    MUTATION OF THE VOICE.      The anatomical and physiological changes which occur in the larynx at  puberty have been described in the chapter on \"Physiology of the Voice.\"  It may be added that at this period the resonance cavities also undergo  considerable alteration in size and form.    As childhood is left behind the individual emerges. Divergences in face,  in form and in mental characteristics become emphasized. The traits of  race and family are manifested and self-consciousness becomes more  acute. This period of development, bringing as it does so much  disturbance to the vocal organs, is particularly inimical to singing;  and yet public school music is expected to produce its most elaborate  results in those grades where the pupils are just about to enter, or are  passing through this period of rapid growth and change. The singing in  such grades may be discussed with reference first to the singing of  girls and then to that of boys.    The vocal organs of girls often develop so gradually in size, and with  so little congestion of the laryngeal substance, that no aversion is  manifested to singing. In other cases the inflamed condition of the  vocal organs is shown by the hoarseness which follows their use, and the  huskiness of the singing-tone. The voices of nearly all during the  mutation period show more volume of tone on the lower tones and  evidences of strain at the higher tones.    It is a good plan to put girls who show throat-weakness, characteristic  of their age, upon that part which requires only a medium range of  tones, and to repress all inclination to force and push the voice. The  desire which girls often express to sing the upper soprano need not  affect the teacher to any great extent. A multitude of strong and  constantly-shifting ambitions are thronging through their minds. Some  wish to sing the highest part because it seems to them to be the most  prominent part; some wish to sing it because they can do so with the  least mental effort, and so on. These whims and wishes must be treated  tactfully, but if the teacher is sure that a certain course is right,  there is no alternative but to carry it out, with as little friction as  may be. Large voices, that is, voices that proceed from large resonance  cavities, are often badly strained at this period of life by too loud  and too high singing. It must not for a moment be forgotten that the age  is a critical one for vocal effort, and a strain that the adult woman's  voice will endure with apparent impunity may produce lasting evil  effects on the voice of a girl of from fourteen to sixteen years of age.    If the requirements of the music are such that pitches above F, the  fifth line G clef, must be occasionally sung, let the voices upon the  part sing lightly. If some of the girls are put upon the lower of three  parts, do not let them use the chest-voice, which is just beginning to  develop, otherwise than lightly also.    The boy's voice may change from the soprano to a light bass of eight or  twelve tones in compass in a few months, or the change may extend over  two or three years; that is, two or three years may elapse after the  first distinct break before there is any certainty of vocal action in  the newly-acquired compass. When the voice changes rapidly, all singing  should be stopped. Really, in such cases, boys cannot sing even if they  attempt to do so.    They are so hoarse, and the pitch alternates so unexpectedly between an  \"unearthly treble and a preternatural bass\" that a boy can usually sing  only in monotone, if, with courage proof against the ridicule occasioned  by his uncontrollable vocal antics, he tries to join in. In those cases,  where the larynx undergoes a slow change in growth, it is often possible  for the boy to sing all through the period of change. The upper tones  may be lost, while there is a corresponding gain of lower tones. This  process, in many cases, goes on slowly and with so little active  congestion of the larynx that the voice changes from soprano to alto,  and thence to tenor almost imperceptibly. Voices which change in this  way often become tenor, but not invariably.    The question now arises, Should those boys who can sing while the voice  is breaking be required to take part in school singing exercises?    In Browne and Behnke's work, \"The Child Voice,\" to which allusion has  been made, there is given a resume of 152 replies to the question: Have  you ever known of boys being made to sing through the period of puberty,  and, if so, with what result?    The answers were:    Forty correspondents have no knowledge.    Five think the voice is improved by the experiment.    Ten quote _solitary instances_ where no harm has arisen.    Ten know of the experiment having been made, and consider it has caused  no harm to the voice.    Eight mention results so variable as to admit of no conclusion.    Seventy-nine say the experiment causes _certain injury_, deterioration  or ruin to the after voice, and of this number ten observe that they  have suffered disastrous effects _in their own person_.    These answers were from English choirmasters, organists, music teachers,  singers, etc. It will be noticed that only fifteen of those who give a  positive opinion upon the subject think that boys can sing through the  period of break safely; while seventy-nine are positive that the result  is unsafe. The other replies are vague.    It must be remembered that many of the opinions are those of instructors  in cathedral schools, where one or two rehearsals and a daily church  service means a great deal of singing; while other answers come from  choirmasters who require of their boys equally hard work, though less in  quantity.    Every individual voice must be judged by itself, if such demands as  choir-singing are made upon it; and, while there are some cases, as  every choirmaster will probably agree, where no perceptible injury  results from singing during the change, the rule is that even when  possible, it is very unsafe.    But the daily time given to singing in schools is very short; the work  bears no comparison with choir-singing. It might almost be thought as  necessary to forbid reading and talking during the break of voice as to  forbid its use in a daily drill of fifteen or twenty minutes in singing.    Certainly it is absurd to advocate entire non-use of the voice at this  period in either speech or song. It is rather correct to guard against  its misuse. If boys have up to this time used only the thick register,  they will in singing through the break intensify their bad habits;  throatiness, harshness, nasality will become chronic. This would be bad  enough, but each bad vocal habit results from the abnormal use of the  vocal organs, and occasions hoarseness, chronic sore throat, catarrh,  etc.    It is quite customary in school music to assign the boys to the lower  part, in part music. This practice continued from the time part-singing  begins in the music course, compels the boys to use the thick register.  As the larynx gains in firmness from year to year, they experience more  and more difficulty with their upper tones-- those lying from F to C.  Having used only the thick voice in all their school singing, they know  of no other, and very likely consider the thin voice which they are now  obliged to use in singing the higher tones as altogether too girlish for  the prospective heirs of manly bass tones.    The reluctance of boys to sing the soprano would be amusing were it not,  in the light of utterly false training, so pitiful.    School music is educational; its scope is controlled by those in charge.  The public expects good educational, rather than show work, and employs  those to supervise and teach who are supposed to know what good  educational work is in vocal music.    The supposition that children's voices can, owing to individual  differences analogous to those existing among adults, be divided into  alto and soprano voices, is erroneous; children can most assuredly sing  in parts, but the quality of tone which in the woman's voice is called  alto or contralto cannot be secured for certain physical reasons  previously explained; and the use of the chest-tone, which resembles the  adult woman's chest-voice as a clarinet resembles a viola, is wholly  objectionable.    If, however, the voices have been trained in the use of the thin  register only, the management of the boy's voice during the change is  simplified; the influence of good vocal habits will be felt; the vocal  bands which have never been strained will respond when their condition  admits of tone-production. The boy who has been accustomed to sing with  an easy action of the vocal ligaments and with open throat will at once  become conscious of any unusual strain or wrong adjustment in the vocal  organs. If he has learned to sing well, he has also learned not to sing  badly.    The test to apply to the subject of boys' singing in school during the  break may be: Can they sing without strain or push? Can they sing  easily, or does it hurt? There is a certain amount of humbug in boys  that must be allowed for, but it does not affect calculations as to  their singing-powers more than upon their other abilities, if singing is  well taught.    The speaking-voice also indicates the state of the vocal organs, and  shows the effect of the break "]]]
