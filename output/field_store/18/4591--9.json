These bodies were, first, the Convention; second, the  Commune of Paris; and thirdly, the Jacobin Club. The jealousy thus  existing outside the Committee would have made any failure instantly  destructive. At one moment, at the end of 1793, it was only the  surrender of Toulon that saved the Committee from a hostile motion in  the Convention, and such a motion would have sent half of them to the  guillotine. They were reviled by the extreme party who ruled at the Town  Hall for not carrying the policy of extermination far enough. They were  reproached by Danton and his powerful section for carrying that policy  too far. They were discredited by the small band of intriguers, like  Bazire, who identified government with peculation. Finally, they were  haunted by the shadow of a fear, which events were by and by to prove  only too substantial, lest one of their military agents on the frontier  should make himself their master. The key to the struggle of the  factions between the winter of 1793 and the revolution of the summer of  1794 is the vigorous resolve of the governing Committees not to part  with power. The drama is one of the most exciting in the history of  faction; it abounds in rapid turns and unexpected shifts, upon which the  student may spend many a day and many a night, and after all he is  forced to leave off in despair of threading an accurate way through the  labyrinth of passion and intrigue. The broad traits of the situation,  however, are tolerably simple. The difficulty was to find a principle of  government which the people could be induced to accept. 'The rights of  men and the new principles of liberty and equality,' Burke said, 'were  very unhandy instruments for those who wished to establish a system of  tranquillity and order. The factions,' he added with fierce sarcasm,  'were to accomplish the purposes of order, morality, and submission to  the laws, from the principles of atheism, profligacy, and sedition. They  endeavoured to establish distinctions, by the belief of which they hoped  to keep the spirit of murder safely bottled up and sealed for their own  purposes, without endangering themselves by the fumes of the poison  which they prepared for their enemies.' This is a ferocious and  passionate version, but it is substantially not an unreal account of the  position.    Upon one point all parties agreed, and that was the necessity of  founding the government upon force, and force naturally meant Terror.  Their plea was that of Dido to Ilioneus and the stormbeaten sons of  Dardanus, when they complained that her people had drawn the sword upon  them, and barbarously denied the hospitality of the sandy shore:--       Res dura et regni novitas me talia cogunt Moliri.    And that pithy chapter in Machiavelli's _Prince_ which treats of cruelty  and clemency, and whether it be better to be loved or feared,  anticipates the defence of the Terrorists, in the maxim that for a new  prince it is impossible to avoid the name of cruel, because all new  states abound in many perils. The difference arose on the question when  Terror should be considered to have done as much of its work as it could  be expected to do. This difference again was connected with difference  of conception as to the type of the society which was ultimately to  emerge from the existing chaos. Billaud-Varennes, the guiding spirit of  the Committees, was without any conception of this kind. He was a man of  force pure and simple. Danton was equally untouched by dreams of social  transformation; his philosophy, so far as he had a definite philosophy,  was, in spite of one or two inconsistent utterances, materialistic: and  materialism, when it takes root in a sane, perspicacious, and indulgent  character, as in the case of Danton, and, to take a better-known  example, in the case of Jefferson, usually leads to a sound and positive  theory of politics; chimeras have no place in it, though a rational  social hope has the first place of all. Neither Danton nor Billaud  expected a millennium; their only aim was to shape France into a  coherent political personality, and the war between them turned upon the  policy of prolonging the Terror after the frontiers had been saved and  the risings in the provinces put down. There were, however, two parties  who took the literature of the century in earnest; they thought that the  hour had struck for translating, one of them, the sentimentalism of  Rousseau, the other of them, the rationality of Voltaire and Diderot,  into terms of politics that should form the basis of a new social life.  The strife between the faction of Robespierre and the faction of  Chaumette was the reproduction, under the shadow of the guillotine, of  the great literary strife of a quarter of a century before between Jean  Jacques and the writers whom he contemptuously styled Holbachians. The  battle of the books had become a battle between bands of infuriated men.  The struggle between Hebert and Chaumette and the Common Council of  Paris on the one part, and the Committee and Robespierre on the other,  was the concrete form of the deepest controversy that lies before modern  society. Can the social union subsist without a belief in God? Chaumette  answered Yes, and Robespierre cried No. Robespierre followed Rousseau in  thinking that any one who should refuse to recognise the existence of a  God, should be exiled as a monster devoid of the faculties of virtue and  sociability. Chaumette followed Diderot, and Diderot told Samuel Romilly  in 1783 that belief in God, as well as submission to kings, would be at  an end all over the world in a very few years. The Hebertists might have  taken for their motto Diderot's shocking couplet, if they could have  known it, about using       Les entrailles du pretre     Au defaut d'un cordon pour etrangler les rois.    The theists and the atheists, Chaumette and Robespierre, each of them  accepted the doctrine that it was in the power of the armed legislator  to impose any belief and any rites he pleased upon the country at his  feet. The theism or the atheism of the new France depended, as they  thought, on the issue of the war for authority between the Hebertists in  the Common Council of Paris, and the Committee of Public Safety. That  was the religious side of the attitude of the government to the  opposition, and it is the side that possesses most historic interest.  Billaud cared very little for religion in any way; his quarrel with the  Commune and with Hebert was political. What Robespierre's drift appears  to have been, was to use the political animosity of the Committee as a  means of striking foes, against whom his own animosity was not only  political but religious also.    It would doubtless show a very dull apprehension of the violence and  confusion of the time, to suppose that even Robespierre, with all his  love for concise theories, was accustomed to state his aim to himself  with the definite neatness in which it appears when reduced to literary  statement. Pedant as he was, he was yet enough of a politician to see  the practical urgency of restoring material order, whatever spiritual  belief or disbelief might accompany it. The prospect of a rallying point  for material order was incessantly changing; and Robespierre turned to  different quarters in search of it almost from week to week. He was only  able to exert a certain limited authority over his colleagues in the  government, by virtue of his influence over the various sections of  possible opposition, and this was a moral, and not an official,  influence. It was acquired not by marked practical gifts, for in truth  Robespierre did not possess them, but by his good character, by his  rhetoric, and by the skill with which he kept himself prominently before  the public eye. The effective seat of his power, notwithstanding many  limits and incessant variations, was the Jacobin Club. There a speech  from him threw his listeners into ecstasies, that have been  disrespectfully compared to the paroxysms of Jansenist convulsionaries,  or the hysterics of Methodist negroes on a cotton plantation. We  naturally think of those grave men who a few years before had founded  the republic in America. Jefferson served with Washington in the  Virginian legislature and with Franklin in Congress, and he afterwards  said that he never heard either of them speak ten minutes at a time;  while John Adams declared that he never heard Jefferson utter three  sentences together. Of Robespierre it is stated on good authority that  for eighteen months there was not a single evening on which he did not  make to the assembled Jacobins at least one speech, and that never a  short one.    Strange as it may seem, Robespierre's credit with this grim assembly was  due to his truly Philistine respectability and to his literary faculty.  He figured as the philosopher and bookman of the party: the most  iconoclastic politicians are usually willing to respect the scholar,  provided they are sure of his being on their side. Robespierre had from  the first discountenanced the fantastic caprices of some too excitable  allies. He distrusted the noisy patriots of the middle class, who  curried favour with the crowd by clothing themselves in coarse garments,  clutching a pike, and donning the famous cap of red woollen, which had  been the emblem of the emancipation of a slave in ancient Rome. One  night at the Jacobin Club, Robespierre mounted the tribune, dressed with  his usual elaborate neatness, and still wearing powder in his hair. An  onlooker unceremoniously planted on the orator's head the red cap  demanded by revolutionary etiquette. Robespierre threw the sacred symbol  on the ground with a severe air, and then proceeded with a discourse of  much austerity. Not that he was averse to a certain seemly decoration,  or to the embodiment of revolutionary sentiment by means of a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20748"],[0,"Favorite Fairy Tales (#12)"],[1,"  slipper it would fit none of them--their feet were all too big!    At last the heralds came to the house where Cinderella lived. The eldest  stepsister tried the slipper on first, but it was quite impossible for  her to get her foot into it, for her great toe was too big. Then her  mother, who was watching eagerly, fetched a carving-knife.    [Illustration]    \"Be quick, cut the toe off,\" she said; \"what does it matter if you are  lame--if you are the Prince's bride you will always ride in a carriage!\"    So the eldest sister cut off her big toe, but it was no use, the slipper  would not fit, and at last she was obliged to hand it to her sister.    But the other sister had no better luck. She did, indeed, get her toes  inside, but her foot was much too long, and her heel stuck out behind.  The mother urged her to cut it off.    \"What does it matter?\" she said. \"If you are the Prince's bride you will  never need to walk any more.\"    But although she cut her heel off, the slipper was still too small; and  at length she, too, had to give up the attempt to force her foot into  it.    Then Cinderella came shyly out from behind the door where she had been  standing out of sight, and asked if she might try on the slipper. Her  stepmother and sisters were very angry, and were about to drive her away  with blows, but the herald stopped them.    \"The Prince wishes every woman in the land to try on this slipper,\" he  said; and asking Cinderella to sit on a chair, he knelt down and tried  the slipper on her foot.    And it fitted her exactly!    While everyone stood and stared in astonishment, Cinderella drew from  her pocket the other slipper and put it on. No sooner had she done so  than her ragged frock changed into the beautiful ball dress again, and  she stood up before them all--the beautiful lady with whom the Prince  had fallen in love at the ball.    The Prince was overjoyed to find her again; and they were married at  once with much pomp amid great rejoicings.    As for the wicked sisters they were so jealous that they both turned  green with envy. They grew uglier and uglier every day, until at last  they grew so dreadfully ugly that nobody could bear to look at them any  longer. But Cinderella became more and more beautiful, and lived happily  with the Prince for ever afterwards.          JACK THE GIANT KILLER    [Illustration]      In the reign of King Arthur there lived in the County of Cornwall a  worthy farmer, who had an only son, named Jack. Jack was strong and  brave and very daring, and was never backward when danger was in the  way.    Now, in those days there lived a huge giant in a gloomy cavern on St.  Michael's Mount, which rises out of the sea near the shores of Cornwall.  The Cornish people had suffered greatly from his thefts and pillaging;  for he used to wade through the sea to the mainland, and carry off half  a dozen or more of their oxen at a time.    At last Jack made up his mind to destroy this monster. He took a horn,  a shovel, a pickaxe, and a dark lantern, and one winter's evening swam  over the sea to the Mount. Then he set to work, and before morning had  dug a great pit. He covered it carefully over with sticks and straw,  and strewed some earth on the top to make it look like solid ground.  And then he blew his horn so loudly that the Giant awoke, and came  out roaring like thunder:    \"You impudent villain--you shall pay dearly for disturbing my rest. I  will broil you for my breakfast!\"    But almost as he spoke, he tumbled headlong into the pit.    \"Oh, ho, Mr. Giant!\" said Jack. \"How is your appetite now! Will nothing  serve you for breakfast but broiling poor Jack?\" Then he struck the  giant such a blow on the head with a pickaxe that he killed him.    When the Justices of Cornwall heard of this valiant deed, they sent  for Jack, and declared that he should always be called Jack the Giant  Killer; and they gave him a sword, and a belt upon which was written,  in letters of gold:        \"This is the valiant Cornishman       Who slew the giant Cormoran.\"    [Illustration]    There was another giant in England called Blunderbore, who vowed to take  revenge on Jack for this exploit. One day, as Jack was passing through a  wood on a journey to Wales, he fell asleep by the side of a fountain.  The Giant, coming along, found him there; and, seeing by the writing on  the belt who Jack was, he lifted him on his shoulder and carried him off  to his castle.    When Jack awoke and found himself in the clutches of Blunderbore he was  terribly frightened. The giant carried him into a room and locked him  up, while he went to fetch another giant who lived close by to help him  eat Jack for dinner. While he was gone, Jack heard dreadful shrieks and  groans from different parts of the castle, and soon after he heard a  mournful voice saying:        \"Haste, valiant stranger, haste away,       Lest you become the giant's prey.       On his return he'll bring another,       Still more savage than his brother;       A horrid, cruel monster, who       Before he kills will torture you!\"    Poor Jack looked out of the window, which was just over the gate of the  castle, and saw two giants coming along arm in arm.    [Illustration]    \"Now,\" thought he, \"death or freedom is at hand.\" There happened to  be two strong cords in the room, and Jack made a large noose with a  slip-knot in each of them. Then, just as the giants were coming through  the gate he threw the ropes over their heads, and, fastening the other  ends to a beam in the ceiling, he pulled the ropes with all his might  until he had nearly strangled the giants. Then he drew his sword and  slipped down the ropes and killed them both.    Next Jack took the keys from Giant Blunderbore and searched through the  castle. In one of the rooms he found three ladies who told him that  their husbands had been killed by the giant, who had afterwards  condemned them to be starved to death.    [Illustration]    Jack gave them the castle and all the riches it contained to make some  amends for the dreadful pains they had suffered, and then went on his  way.    After traveling some days, he lost himself in a lonely valley; but, when  he had wandered about some while, he at length succeeded in finding a  large house. He went up to it and knocked loudly at the gate, when, to  his great horror, a monstrous giant with two heads came forth. He spoke  very civilly, however, and took Jack into the house, leading him to a  room where there was a good bed, in which he could pass the night.    Jack took off his clothes; but, though he was very tired, he could not  go to sleep. Presently he heard the giant walking about in the  bedchamber, which was the next room, saying to himself:        \"Though here you lodge with me this night;       You shall not see the morning light;       My club shall dash your brains out quite.\"    When he heard this, Jack got out of bed, and, taking a large, thick  piece of wood, he laid it in his own place in the bed, and hid himself  in a dark corner of the room.    In the middle of the night, the giant came with his great club, and  struck several heavy blows upon the bed. Then he went off, thinking he  had broken all Jack's bones.    Early next morning Jack walked into the giant's room and thanked him  for the night's lodging. The giant was terribly startled to see him,  and stammered out:    \"Oh, dear me! Is it you? Pray, how did you sleep last night? Did you  hear or see anything to disturb you?\"    \"Nothing worth speaking of, thank you,\" answered Jack, carelessly. \"A  rat, I believe, gave me three or four slaps with his tail; but that was  all.\"    The giant said nothing; but went and fetched two bowls of hasty pudding  for their breakfast.    Jack did not wish the giant to think that he could not eat as much as  himself, so he contrived to fasten a leathern bag inside his coat. He  then managed to slip the pudding into this bag, while pretending to eat  it. When breakfast was done, he said to the giant:    \"Now I will show you a fine trick. I can cure all wounds with a touch.  You shall see an example.\" He then took a knife, ripped up the leathern  bag, and all the hasty pudding tumbled out upon the floor.    \"Ods splutter hur nails!\" cried the giant, who was ashamed to be outdone  by such a little fellow. \"Hur can do that hurself!\" and, snatching up  the knife, he plunged it into his stomach and fell down dead.    [Illustration]    After this, Jack went farther on his journey. In a few days he met King  Arthur's only son, who was traveling into Wales to deliver a beautiful  lady from the power of a wicked magician. Jack attached himself to the  Prince, and they traveled on together.    The Prince was very generous, and soon gave away all the money he  possessed.    After having parted with his last penny to an old beggar-woman, he was  very uneasy as to where they were to pass the night.    [Illustration]    \"Sir,\" said Jack, \"two miles farther on there lives a giant with three  heads, who can fight five hundred men at once and make them fly. I will  go on and visit him--do you wait here until I return.\"    Jack rode on to the gates of the castle, and gave a loud knock. The  giant, with a voice like thunder, roared out:    \"Who is there?\"    \"No one but your poor Cousin Jack.\"    \"Well, what news, Cousin Jack?\"    \"Dear Uncle, I have bad news for you. Here is the King's son coming  with two thousand men to kill you!\"    \"Cousin Jack, this is bad news indeed! But I have a large cellar  underground, where I shall hide myself, and you shall lock, bolt  and bar me in until the King's son is gone.\"    So Jack locked, bolted and barred the giant in the cellar, and then  went back and fetched the Prince, and they feasted and made merry,  and spent the night very comfortably in the castle.    [Illustration]    In the morning Jack gave the Prince gold and silver from the giant's  treasury. Then the Prince set forth on his journey,"]]]
