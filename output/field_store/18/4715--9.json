[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/236"],[0,"The Jungle Book (#12)"],[1,"the  herd in two, Akela. Keep the cows and calves together, and the bulls and  the plow buffaloes by themselves.\"    The two wolves ran, ladies'-chain fashion, in and out of the herd, which  snorted and threw up its head, and separated into two clumps. In one,  the cow-buffaloes stood with their calves in the center, and glared  and pawed, ready, if a wolf would only stay still, to charge down and  trample the life out of him. In the other, the bulls and the young bulls  snorted and stamped, but though they looked more imposing they were much  less dangerous, for they had no calves to protect. No six men could have  divided the herd so neatly.    \"What orders!\" panted Akela. \"They are trying to join again.\"    Mowgli slipped on to Rama's back. \"Drive the bulls away to the left,  Akela. Gray Brother, when we are gone, hold the cows together, and drive  them into the foot of the ravine.\"    \"How far?\" said Gray Brother, panting and snapping.    \"Till the sides are higher than Shere Khan can jump,\" shouted Mowgli.  \"Keep them there till we come down.\" The bulls swept off as Akela bayed,  and Gray Brother stopped in front of the cows. They charged down on him,  and he ran just before them to the foot of the ravine, as Akela drove  the bulls far to the left.    \"Well done! Another charge and they are fairly started. Careful,  now--careful, Akela. A snap too much and the bulls will charge. Hujah!  This is wilder work than driving black-buck. Didst thou think these  creatures could move so swiftly?\" Mowgli called.    \"I have--have hunted these too in my time,\" gasped Akela in the dust.  \"Shall I turn them into the jungle?\"    \"Ay! Turn. Swiftly turn them! Rama is mad with rage. Oh, if I could only  tell him what I need of him to-day.\"    The bulls were turned, to the right this time, and crashed into the  standing thicket. The other herd children, watching with the cattle half  a mile away, hurried to the village as fast as their legs could carry  them, crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away.    But Mowgli's plan was simple enough. All he wanted to do was to make a  big circle uphill and get at the head of the ravine, and then take the  bulls down it and catch Shere Khan between the bulls and the cows; for  he knew that after a meal and a full drink Shere Khan would not be in  any condition to fight or to clamber up the sides of the ravine. He was  soothing the buffaloes now by voice, and Akela had dropped far to the  rear, only whimpering once or twice to hurry the rear-guard. It was a  long, long circle, for they did not wish to get too near the ravine and  give Shere Khan warning. At last Mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd  at the head of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply down to  the ravine itself. From that height you could see across the tops of the  trees down to the plain below; but what Mowgli looked at was the sides  of the ravine, and he saw with a great deal of satisfaction that they  ran nearly straight up and down, while the vines and creepers that hung  over them would give no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get out.    \"Let them breathe, Akela,\" he said, holding up his hand. \"They have not  winded him yet. Let them breathe. I must tell Shere Khan who comes. We  have him in the trap.\"    He put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravine--it was almost  like shouting down a tunnel--and the echoes jumped from rock to rock.    After a long time there came back the drawling, sleepy snarl of a  full-fed tiger just wakened.    \"Who calls?\" said Shere Khan, and a splendid peacock fluttered up out of  the ravine screeching.    \"I, Mowgli. Cattle thief, it is time to come to the Council Rock!  Down--hurry them down, Akela! Down, Rama, down!\"    The herd paused for an instant at the edge of the slope, but Akela gave  tongue in the full hunting-yell, and they pitched over one after the  other, just as steamers shoot rapids, the sand and stones spurting up  round them. Once started, there was no chance of stopping, and before  they were fairly in the bed of the ravine Rama winded Shere Khan and  bellowed.    \"Ha! Ha!\" said Mowgli, on his back. \"Now thou knowest!\" and the torrent  of black horns, foaming muzzles, and staring eyes whirled down the  ravine just as boulders go down in floodtime; the weaker buffaloes being  shouldered out to the sides of the ravine where they tore through the  creepers. They knew what the business was before them--the terrible  charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand.  Shere Khan heard the thunder of their hoofs, picked himself up, and  lumbered down the ravine, looking from side to side for some way of  escape, but the walls of the ravine were straight and he had to hold on,  heavy with his dinner and his drink, willing to do anything rather than  fight. The herd splashed through the pool he had just left, bellowing  till the narrow cut rang. Mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot  of the ravine, saw Shere Khan turn (the tiger knew if the worst came  to the worst it was better to meet the bulls than the cows with their  calves), and then Rama tripped, stumbled, and went on again over  something soft, and, with the bulls at his heels, crashed full into the  other herd, while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet  by the shock of the meeting. That charge carried both herds out into the  plain, goring and stamping and snorting. Mowgli watched his time, and  slipped off Rama's neck, laying about him right and left with his stick.    \"Quick, Akela! Break them up. Scatter them, or they will be fighting one  another. Drive them away, Akela. Hai, Rama! Hai, hai, hai! my children.  Softly now, softly! It is all over.\"    Akela and Gray Brother ran to and fro nipping the buffaloes' legs,  and though the herd wheeled once to charge up the ravine again, Mowgli  managed to turn Rama, and the others followed him to the wallows.    Shere Khan needed no more trampling. He was dead, and the kites were  coming for him already.    \"Brothers, that was a dog's death,\" said Mowgli, feeling for the knife  he always carried in a sheath round his neck now that he lived with men.  \"But he would never have shown fight. His hide will look well on the  Council Rock. We must get to work swiftly.\"    A boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a ten-foot  tiger alone, but Mowgli knew better than anyone else how an animal's  skin is fitted on, and how it can be taken off. But it was hard work,  and Mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour, while the wolves  lolled out their tongues, or came forward and tugged as he ordered them.  Presently a hand fell on his shoulder, and looking up he saw Buldeo with  the Tower musket. The children had told the village about the buffalo  stampede, and Buldeo went out angrily, only too anxious to correct  Mowgli for not taking better care of the herd. The wolves dropped out of  sight as soon as they saw the man coming.    \"What is this folly?\" said Buldeo angrily. \"To think that thou canst  skin a tiger! Where did the buffaloes kill him? It is the Lame Tiger  too, and there is a hundred rupees on his head. Well, well, we will  overlook thy letting the herd run off, and perhaps I will give thee one  of the rupees of the reward when I have taken the skin to Khanhiwara.\"  He fumbled in his waist cloth for flint and steel, and stooped down to  singe Shere Khan's whiskers. Most native hunters always singe a tiger's  whiskers to prevent his ghost from haunting them.    \"Hum!\" said Mowgli, half to himself as he ripped back the skin of a  forepaw. \"So thou wilt take the hide to Khanhiwara for the reward, and  perhaps give me one rupee? Now it is in my mind that I need the skin for  my own use. Heh! Old man, take away that fire!\"    \"What talk is this to the chief hunter of the village? Thy luck and the  stupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee to this kill. The tiger has  just fed, or he would have gone twenty miles by this time. Thou canst  not even skin him properly, little beggar brat, and forsooth I, Buldeo,  must be told not to singe his whiskers. Mowgli, I will not give thee one  anna of the reward, but only a very big beating. Leave the carcass!\"    \"By the Bull that bought me,\" said Mowgli, who was trying to get at the  shoulder, \"must I stay babbling to an old ape all noon? Here, Akela,  this man plagues me.\"    Buldeo, who was still stooping over Shere Khan's head, found himself  sprawling on the grass, with a gray wolf standing over him, while Mowgli  went on skinning as though he were alone in all India.    \"Ye-es,\" he said, between his teeth. \"Thou art altogether right, Buldeo.  Thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward. There is an old war  between this lame tiger and myself--a very old war, and--I have won.\"    To do Buldeo justice, if he had been ten years younger he would have  taken his chance with Akela had he met the wolf in the woods, but a wolf  who obeyed the orders of this boy who had private wars with man-eating  tigers was not a common animal. It was sorcery, magic of the worst kind,  thought Buldeo, and he wondered whether the amulet round his neck would  protect him. He lay as still as still, expecting every minute to see  Mowgli turn into a tiger too.    \"Maharaj! Great King,\" he said at last in a husky whisper.    \"Yes,\" said Mowgli, without turning his head, chuckling a little.    \"I am an old man. I did not know that thou wast anything more than a  herdsboy. May I rise up and go away, or will thy servant tear me to  pieces?\"    \"Go, and peace go with thee. Only, another time do not meddle with my  game. Let him go, Akela.\"    Buldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he could, looking back  over his shoulder in case Mowgli should change into something terrible.  When he got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and  sorcery that made the priest look very grave.    Mowgli went on with his work, but it was nearly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23609"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: Light on Dark Corners (#12)"],[1,"{68} a man differs from you, do you differ from him; and that from his  standpoint you are naturally as repulsive to him, as he, from your  standpoint, is to you. So, leave all this talk of congeniality to silly  girls and transcendental dreamers.    [Illustration: GATHERING ORANGES IN THE SUNNY SOUTH.]    9. DO BUSINESS IN YOUR WAY AND BE HONEST.--Do your business in your own  way, and concede to every man the privilege which you claim for yourself.  The more you mix with men, the less you will be disposed to quarrel, and  the more charitable and liberal will you become. The fact that you do not  understand a man, is quite as likely to be your fault as his. There are a  good many chances in favor of the conclusion that, if you fail to like an  individual whose acquaintance you make it is through your own ignorance and  illiberality. So I say, meet every man honestly; seek to know him; and you  will find that in those points in which he differs from you rests his power  to instruct you, enlarge you, and do you good. Keep your heart open for  everybody, and be sure that you shall have your reward. You shall find a  jewel under the most uncouth exterior; and associated with homeliest  manners and oddest ways and ugliest faces, you will find rare virtues,  fragrant little humanities, and inspiring heroisms.    10. WITHOUT SOCIETY, WITHOUT INFLUENCE.--Again: you can have no influence  unless you are social. An unsocial man is as devoid of influence as an  ice-peak is of verdure. It is through social contact and absolute social  value alone that you can accomplish any great social good. It is through  the invisible lines which you are able to attach to the minds with which  you are brought into association alone that you can tow society, with its  deeply freighted interests, to the great haven of your hope.    11. THE REVENGE OF SOCIETY.--The revenge which society takes upon the man  who isolates himself, is as terrible as it is inevitable. The pride which  sits alone will have the privilege of sitting alone in its sublime disgust  till it drops into the grave. The world sweeps by the man, carelessly,  remorselessly, contemptuously. He has no hold upon society, because he is  no part of it.    12. THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.--You cannot move men until you are  one of them. They will not follow you until they have heard your voice,  shaken your hand, and fully learned your principles and your sympathies. It  makes no difference how much you know, or how much you are capable of  doing. You may pile accomplishment upon acquisition mountain high; but if  you fail to be a social man, demonstrating to society that your lot is with  the rest, a {69} little child with a song in its mouth, and a kiss for all  and a pair of innocent hands to lay upon the knees, shall lead more hearts  and change the direction of more lives than you.           *       *       *       *       *      {70}    Politeness.    1. BEAUTIFUL BEHAVIOR.--Politeness has been described as the art of  showing, by external signs, the internal regard we have for others. But one  may be perfectly polite to another without necessarily paying a special  regard for him. Good manners are neither more nor less than beautiful  behavior. It has been well said that \"a beautiful form is better than a  beautiful face, and a beautiful behavior is better than a beautiful form;  it gives a higher pleasure than statues or pictures--it is the finest of  the fine arts.\"    2. TRUE POLITENESS.--The truest politeness comes of sincerity. It must be  the outcome of the heart, or it will make no lasting impression; for no  amount of polish can dispense with truthfulness. The natural character must  be allowed to appear, freed of its angularities and asperities. Though  politeness, in its best form, should resemble water--\"best when clearest,  most simple, and without taste\"--yet genius in a man will always cover many  defects of manner, and much will be excused to the strong and the original.  Without genuineness and individuality, human life would lose much of its  interest and variety, as well as its manliness and robustness of character.    3. PERSONALITY OF OTHERS.--True politeness especially exhibits itself in  regard for the personality of others. A man will respect the individuality  of another if he wishes to be respected himself. He will have due regard  for his views and opinions, even though they differ from his own. The  well-mannered man pays a compliment to another, and sometimes even secures  his respect by patiently listening to him. He is simply tolerant and  forbearant, and refrains from judging harshly; and harsh judgments of  others will almost invariably provoke harsh judgments of ourselves.    4. THE IMPOLITE.--The impolite, impulsive man will, however, sometimes  rather lose his friend than his joke. He may surely be pronounced a very  foolish person who secures another's hatred at the price of a moment's  gratification. It was a saying of Burnel, the engineer--himself one of the  kindest-natured of men--that \"spite and ill-nature are among the most  expensive luxuries in life.\" Dr. Johnson once said: \"Sir, a man has no more  right to say a rude thing to another than to knock him down.\"    5. FEELINGS OF OTHERS.--Want of respect for the feelings of others usually  originates in selfishness, and issues in {71} hardness and repulsiveness of  manner. It may not proceed from malignity so much, as from want of  sympathy, and want of delicacy--a want of that perception of, and attention  to, those little and apparently trifling things, by which pleasure is given  or pain occasioned to others. Indeed, it may be said that in self-sacrifice  in the ordinary intercourse of life, mainly consists the difference between  being well and ill bred. Without some degree of self-restraint in society a  man may be found almost insufferable. No one has pleasure in holding  intercourse with such a person, and he is a constant source of annoyance to  those about him.    6. DISREGARD OF OTHERS.--Men may show their disregard to others in various  impolite ways, as, for instance, by neglect of propriety in dress, by the  absence of cleanliness, or by indulging in repulsive habits. The slovenly,  dirty person, by rendering himself physically disagreeable, sets the tastes  and feelings of others at defiance, and is rude and uncivil, only under  another form.    7. THE BEST SCHOOL OF POLITENESS.--The first and best school of politeness,  as of character, is always the home, where woman is the teacher. The  manners of society at large are but the reflex of the manners of our  collective homes, neither better nor worse. Yet, with all the disadvantages  of ungenial homes, men may practice self-culture of manner as of intellect,  and learn by good examples to cultivate a graceful and agreeable behavior  towards others. Most men are like so many gems in the rough, which need  polishing by contact with other and better natures, to bring out their full  beauty and lustre. Some have but one side polished, sufficient only to show  the delicate graining of the interior; but to bring out the full qualities  of the gem, needs the discipline of experience, and contact with the best  examples of character in the intercourse of daily life.    8. CAPTIOUSNESS OF MANNER.--While captiousness of manner, and the habit of  disputing and contradicting every thing said, is chilling and repulsive,  the opposite habit of assenting to, and sympathizing with, every statement  made, or emotion expressed, is almost equally disagreeable. It is unmanly,  and is felt to be dishonest. \"It may seem difficult,\" says Richard Sharp,  \"to steer always between bluntness and plain dealing, between merited  praises and lavishing indiscriminate flattery; but it is very easy--good  humor, kindheartedness, and perfect simplicity, being all that are  requisite to do what is right in the right way.\" At the same time many are  impolite, not because they mean to be so, but because they are awkward, and  perhaps know no better. {72}    9. SHY PEOPLE.--Again many persons are thought to be stiff, reserved, and  proud, when they are only shy. Shyness is characteristic of most people of  the Teutonic race. From all that can be learned of Shakespeare, it is to be  inferred that he was an exceedingly shy man. The manner in which his plays  were sent into the world--for it is not known that he edited or authorized  the publication of a single one of them,--and the dates at which they  respectively appeared, are mere matters of conjecture.    10. SELF-FORGETFULNESS.--True politeness is best evinced by  self-forgetfulness, or self-denial in the interest of others. Mr. Garfield,  our martyred president, was a gentleman of royal type. His friend, Col.  Rockwell, says of him: \"In the midst of his suffering he never forgets  others. For instance, to-day he said to me, 'Rockwell, there is a poor  soldier's widow who came to me before this thing occurred, and I promised  her, she should be provided for. I want you to see that the matter is  attended to at once.' He is the most docile patient I ever saw.\"    11. ITS BRIGHT SIDE.--We have thus far spoken of shyness as a defect. But  there is another way of looking at it; for even shyness has its bright  side, and contains an element of good. Shy men and shy races are ungraceful  and undemonstrative, because, as regards society at large, they are  comparatively unsociable. They do not possess those elegancies of manner  acquired by free intercourse, which distinguish the social races, because  their tendency is to shun society rather than to seek it. They are shy in  the presence of strangers, and shy even in their own families. They hide  their affections under a robe of reserve, and when they do give way to  their feelings, it is only in some very hidden inner chamber. And yet, the  feelings are there, and not the less healthy and genuine, though they are  not made the subject of"]]]
