I  wonder if ever, ever there will be a tablet with my name upon it!\"    \"I expect there will be,\" said Dorothy.  \"It's a lovely idea, and I can  imagine every girl longing to see her name on the scroll of honour; but  for my own part I never shall.  Not for this child!  There is no hope  for me, unless they put me up as `a good little tortoise who never fell  asleep.'  The worst of it is that in real life the hare keeps awake too,  and spoils one's chance.  I must be content to bloom, in obscurity--`A  violet by a mossy dell, half hidden from the eye'--\"    But Rhoda already saw a new tablet twinkling on the empty space, a  tablet recording phenomenal success and distinction, and the name at the  head of the inscription was not \"Kathleen Murray,\" but one much more  familiar in her ears!        CHAPTER EIGHT.    AN ENCOUNTER.    Sunday afternoon was hopelessly wet; but the fact was less regretted  than usual, as from three to four was the time put aside for writing  home.  So far a postcard to announce safe arrival had been the only word  written, and each girl was eager to pour forth her feelings at length,  to tell the latest news, and report changes of class.  The two new-  comers had a score of complaints and lamentations to record, and Rhoda,  at least, entered unhesitatingly into the recital.    She had never been so miserable in her life.  The girls were hateful,  domineering, and unfriendly--Miss Bruce had spoken to her three times  only--the food was good enough in its way, but so plain that she simply  longed for something _nice_; the lessons were difficult, the hours  unbearably long.--It took three whole sheets to complete the list of  grievances, by which time her hand was so tired that she read it over by  way of a rest, with the result that she was quite astonished to discover  how miserable she had been!  Everything she had said was true, and yet  somehow the impression given was of a depth of woe which she could not  honestly say she had experienced.  Perhaps it was that she had omitted  to mention the alleviating circumstances--Miss Everett's sweetness,  Fraulein's praise, hours of relaxation in the grounds, signs of  softening on the part of the girls, early hours and regular exercises,  which sent her to the simple meals with an appetite she had never known  at home.  Five days at school, and on the whole there had been as much  pleasure as suffering.  Then, was it quite fair to send home such a  misleading account?    Rhoda drew from her pocket the latest of the five loving letters penned  by the maternal hand, and read it through for the dozenth time.  Sunday  was a lonely day for new-comers, and the period occupied by the sermon  in church had been principally occupied by Rhoda in pressing back the  tears which showed a presumptuous desire to roll down her cheeks and  splash upon her gloves.  It had been a sweet consolation to read over  and over again the words which showed that though she might be one of a  crowd at \"Hurst,\" she was still the treasured darling of her home.  There was nothing original in the letter; it simply repeated in  different words the contents of its four predecessors--sorrow for her  absence, prayers for her welfare, anxiety for the first long letter.    \"I can hardly wait until Monday morning.  I am so longing to know how  you are faring!\"  Rhoda read these words, and looked slowly down upon  her own letter.  Well! it would arrive, and the butler would place it on  the breakfast-table, and her mother would come hurrying into the room,  and seize it with a little cry of joy.  She would read it over, and  then--then she would hand it to her husband, and take out her  handkerchief and begin to cry.  Mr Chester would pooh-pooh her  distress, but she would cry quietly behind the urn, and despite his  affectation of indifference he, also, would look worried and troubled;  while Harold would declare that every one must go through the same stage  before settling down, and that Rhoda might be expected to \"make a fuss.\"  She had been so spoiled at home!    Rhoda dug her pen into the blotting-paper, and frowned uneasily.  Five  days' experience at school had impressed her with the feebleness of  \"making a fuss.\"    \"If you are hurt--bear it!  If you are teased--look pleasant!  If you  are blamed--do better next time!  If you feel blue--perk up, and don't  be a baby!\"  Such were the Spartan rules of the new life, and an  unaccustomed shame rose up in her mind at the realisation of the  selfishness and weak betrayal of that first home letter.  Was it not  possible to represent the truth from the bright side as well as the  dark, to dwell on the kindnesses she had received, and leave  disagreeables untold?  Yes, it _was_ possible; she would do so, and save  her dear ones the pain of grieving for her unhappiness.  So the thick  sheets were torn across with a wrench, which made Thomasina look up from  her desk.    As a head girl, \"Tom\" possessed a study of her own, to which she had  prepared to depart earlier in the afternoon, but had been persuaded to  stay by the entreaties of her companions.    \"Tom, don't go!  Don't leave us!  It's a wet day, and so dull--do stay  with us till tea-time.  You might!  You might!\" urged the suppliant  voices, and so Tom sat down to her desk in the house-parlour which was  the property of the elder Blues, and indited letters on blue-lined,  manly paper, with a manly quill pen.    As her eyes rested on the torn letter and on the clean sheet of paper  drawn up for a fresh start, she smiled, a quiet understand-all-about-it  smile, which Rhoda chose to consider an impertinent liberty.  Then down  went her head again, and the scrape, scrape of pens continued until four  o'clock, by which time the girls were thankful to fold the sheets in  their envelopes and make them ready for post.  Rhoda read over her  second effort in a glow of virtue, and found it a model of excellence.  No complaints this time, no weak self-pity; but a plain statement of  facts without any personal bias.  Her father and mother would believe  that she was entirely contented; but Harold, having been through the  same experiences, would read between the lines and understand the  reserve.  He would say to himself that he had not expected it of Rhoda,  and that she had behaved \"like a brick,\" and Harold's praise was worth  receiving.    Altogether it was in a happier frame of mind that Rhoda left her desk  and took her place in one of the easy chairs with which the room was  supplied.  From four to five was a free hour on Sundays, and the girls  were allowed to spend it as they liked, without the presence of a  teacher.    This afternoon talk was the order of the day, each girl in turn relating  the doings of the holidays, and having her adventures capped by the next  speaker.  Thomasina, however, showed a sleepy tendency, and kept dozing  off for a short nap, and then nodding her head so violently that she  awoke with a gasp of surprise.  In one of these intervals she met  Dorothy's eyes fixed upon her with a wondering scrutiny, which seemed to  afford her acute satisfaction.    \"Ah!\" she cried, sitting up and looking in a trice quite spry and wide-  awake.  \"I know what you are doing!  You are admiring me, and wondering  what work of nature I most resemble.  I can see it in your face.  And  you came to the conclusion that it was a codfish!  No quibbles, please!  Tell me the truth.  That was just exactly it, wasn't it?\"    \"_No_!\" cried Dorothy emphatically, but the emphasis expressed rather  contrition for a lost opportunity than for a wrongful suspicion.  \"No, I  did not!\" it seemed to say, \"How stupid not to have thought of it.  You--really--are--extraordinarily like!\"    \"Humph!\" said Thomasina.  \"Then you are the exception, that's all.  All  the new-comers say so, and therein they err.  It's not a cod at all,  it's a pike.  I am the staring image of a pike!\"    She screwed up her little eyes as she spoke, and pulled back her chin in  a wonderful, fish-like grin which awoke a shriek of merriment from the  beholders.  Even Rhoda laughed with the rest, and reflected that if one  were born ugly it was a capital plan to accept the fact, and make it a  joke rather than a reproach.  Thomasina was the plainest girl she had  ever seen, yet she exercised a wonderful attraction, and was infinitely  more popular among her companions than Irene Grey, with her big eyes and  well-cut features.    \"Next time you catch a pike just look at it and see if I'm not right,\"  continued Tom easily.  \"But perhaps you don't fish.  I'm a great angler  myself.  That's the way I spend most of my time during the holidays.\"    \"I don't like fishing, its so wormy,\" said Irene, with a shudder.  \"I  like lolling about and feeling that there's nothing to do, and no  wretched bells jangling every half-hour to send you off to a fresh  class.  `Nerve rest,' that's what _I_ need in my holidays, and I take  good care that I get it.\"    \"I don't want rest.  I want to fly round the whole day and do nice  things,\" said a bright-eyed girl in a wonderful plaid dress ornamented  with countless buttons--\"lunches, and teas, and dinners, and picnics,  and dances, and plays.  I like to live in a whirl, and stay in bed to  breakfast, and be waited on hand and foot.  I don't say I _get_ it, but  it's what I would have if I could.\"    \"Well, I'm a nice, good little maid who likes to help her mother and be  useful.  When I go back I say to her, `Now don't worry any more, dear;  leave all to me,' and I run the house and make them all c-ringe before  me.  Even the cook is afraid of me.  She says I have such `masterful  ways.'\"    The speaker was a tall, fair girl, with a very large pair of spectacles  perched on the bridge of an aquiline nose.  She looked \"masterful\"  enough to frighten a dozen cooks, and made a striking contrast to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21111"],[0,"Wild Nature Won By Kindness (#12)"],[1,"alive, even though it may be  in obedience to natural instincts. Happily I soon found a substitute. I  was showing one of the shrews to a fellow-student of natural history,  and with a long feather soon attracted the little animal's attention; he  always came out of his bed and sprang upon the feather like a little  tiger, dragging it about and holding on with the grip of a bull-dog, so  that one could lift him off the ground and keep him swinging a minute in  the air to see the pretty white fur underneath. My friend suggested that  it probably fed on small birds and thought the feather was part of its  daily fare.    I obtained a fowl's head from the larder, and then it was a sight to see  how it was pounced upon and dragged about until securely hidden under  the moss, when we could hear our little friend crunching the bones and  tearing it to pieces as if he had not had anything so good for a long  while.    One shrew died in a few days, but the other lived three weeks in perfect  health, and I believe it was an accidental failure of sufficient food  that led to the death of the second; their appetite seems to be, like  that of the mole, most voracious, and unless they obtain a constant and  ample supply of food they quickly die of hunger.    They are worth studying for a few days, but their dreadful odour and  fierce character make them anything but pets. I suppose there is hardly  any animal in England so fierce and combative, and probably that may  account for the fact that one so often comes across a dead shrew lying  on the path in summer.    When swimming, the shrew's furry coat perfectly resisted the entrance of  moisture; it always came out absolutely dry. The said coat was most  carefully kept in order; a daily brushing and cleansing went on, the  little tongue was often at work licking off every little speck of dust;  the toes were spread out and examined; the small amount of tail kept in  order. I could but think how many a lesson we may learn from the small  as well as the great creations of God's hand--habits such as this little  animal possessed might, in the way of cleanliness, lead to the  prevention of endless diseases, if imitated by those who never dream of  daily cleansings as being necessary to health and life.    [Illustration]          [Illustration: SQUIRREL.]    SQUIRRELS.      If one lives in the country where these graceful little animals exist,  it is well worth while to attract them near the house so that one may  enjoy the sight their gambols and minister to their wants by suitable  diet. As I have already said, for many years food was placed in a basket  outside the dining-room window to attract the charming little titmice,  and four species might be seen feasting on fat of different kinds. I  placed Barcelona nuts for the nuthatches, and they came and shared the  contents of the basket with the tits. The nuts also drew a squirrel to  the spot, and after about a year, the little fellow became so used to  seeing us moving in the room that he would sit in the basket with his  graceful little tail curved over his back, cracking his nuts, and  nibbling away quite at ease. Then the window was opened and the nuts put  on a table inside the room, and there little \"Frolic\" sits whilst we are  at meals and forms one of the family, holding his nuts cleverly in his  paws, whilst his sharp teeth bite a hole in them, and, regardless of  tidiness, he flings the shells about as he nibbles at the kernels,  looking at us with his black, beady eyes, perhaps speculating upon what  our breakfast may be. How much more enjoyable is this sort of pet than a  poor caged squirrel whirling round in his wheel, condemned to a dreary  life, with no freedom or change, no intercourse with his kind.    In town there is, perhaps, no way to keep a squirrel but in a cage; even  so, by an occasional release from its captivity, a constant variety in  its food, and its being talked to and noticed, its life may be made  less irksome, and, if young, it may eventually be made quite tame, and  become an interesting daily companion.    We derived great amusement from our squirrel visitors; one after another  they would leap up the side of the window and spring in and out of the  basket in quick succession, carrying away a nut at each visit, playing  and skirmishing with each other in lively fashion. I am sorry to confess  there was great jealousy amongst them. A second squirrel took to coming  into the room, and Frolic and he had a pitched battle, in which our  favourite, poor little fellow! lost half his ear, and a sponge and water  were needed to efface the sanguinary stains left by the fight.    The squirrel's great enemy is the cat. One would not think she could  catch the agile little creature; but one day we saw a cat watching an  unconscious little squirrel under the tulip-tree: we did not dream that  she could harm it, but in a moment she made one swift rush at her prey.  The squirrel ran at full speed, but alas! before we could interfere it  was caught and carried away.    At Dropmore, the gardener told us he had a cat that kept the Pinetum  quite clear of squirrels. They certainly nibble the young shoots of firs  and horse-chestnuts unmercifully in the spring, and one very dry summer  they took very kindly to our peaches and nectarines; but I freely  forgive their little sins, and should be sorry to miss them from the  lawn where there are often four or five to be seen at once.    They chase each other round a tree-stem with wonderful agility, and  express their animosity with angry grunts and a stamp of the foot like a  rabbit. In autumn I have acorns and beech-mast collected, and store some  bushels of each to be doled out through the winter and spring; strewn  under the tulip-tree this food, mixed with corn, attracts an amusing  variety of live creatures. Besides the squirrels which are constantly  there, we see jays, wood-pigeons, jackdaws, rooks, and flocks of the  smaller birds; if snow should prevail, a whole rookery will come to see  what is to be had. By constantly watching their movements I have learnt  that the squirrel's tail has quite a language of its own. It can be  curved over its back and so spread out that on a wet day it forms a  complete shelter from rain. It will take the form of a note of  interrogation or lie flat on the ground, stand out at an angle or  bristle with anger, according to the mood of the possessor.    I did not find the American chipmunks, before alluded to, at all  tameable. They were very handsome, of grey colour with dark brown  stripes on their sides.    They were extremely wild, and would spring round their cage in perfect  terror when looked at, so, finding they could not be made happy in  confinement, I let them loose in the garden in the hope they might  burrow under a large rhododendron clump, but after a day or two they  disappeared, and I suppose they made their escape to a neighbouring  wood, so that I have little hope of ever seeing them again.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    A MOLE.      A live mole above-ground is a somewhat rare sight, for, as a rule, his  habits are altogether subterranean; but now and then he may be captured  by a sudden grasp as he scrambles along in his odd, unwieldly fashion,  and a curious fellow he is in many ways.    Strolling quietly along a country lane one summer's evening, I heard a  great rustling in a dry ditch, the dead leaves were being scattered  right and left, and I stopped to see what could be the cause. In a  minute the black velvet coat of a mole appeared, and I at once resolved  to endeavour to catch it, though with little hope of success, for the  creature is apt to dive into the ground in an instant when alarmed.  However, watching my opportunity, I managed to seize and hold him  firmly; but I had nothing to put him in, and he struggled furiously to  escape. All I could do was to roll him up in one end of my black lace  shawl and hurry home with my capture. Alas! for the unlucky shawl--the  mole soon began rending and tearing it into shreds with his powerful  feet and teeth. I was rapidly becoming acquainted with the habits of  moles, and in a way that I should not soon forget; still, that mole must  be brought home somehow, and I next transferred him to my dress pocket,  which I held fast, whilst he scrambled and pushed his strong little  snout in all directions to find some way of escape. He was soon placed  in a zinc fern case, with glass sides, supplied with earth to burrow in,  and fed with worms. I also gave him a pan of water, as I remembered  seeing a plan of a mole's burrow which always includes a place for  water. It was a really painful sight to watch the creature feeding; he  pounced upon a worm with the fury of a tiger, and holding it in his  mouth, tore it to pieces with his sharp claws and rapidly devoured all  the pieces, and snuffing about to make sure he had quite finished it, he  then darted off to seek another. The mole has a most voracious appetite  and dies very quickly if unable to obtain food. I was interested to  watch the bustling, active life of the little creature; his morning  toilet when the black velvet coat was attended to, carefully brushed and  licked by a tiny red tongue (though it never seemed to pick up dirt or  defilement in its passage through the earth) and finally, after a few  days, I had the pleasure of setting him free, when he dived into the  ground out of sight in a moment.    Some years later a live mole was much desired by a young relative who  was giving Natural History lectures to some school children. It happened  that a mole had found its way into the conservatory and was doing much  damage there by making its runs close to the surface and uprooting the  plants in its course. The gardener and I resolved to catch it; he was  anxious to prevent further mischief to his plants, and I was wishing to  help the lecturer by sending a lively specimen"]]]
