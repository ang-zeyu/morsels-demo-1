In particular, in the four eastern bays the  triforium passage runs outside instead of inside the building. The  clerestory windows are recessed, and in front of them, running flush  with the buttresses, is a screen of three divisions to each bay (see  illustration, p. 62). The triforium passage, hidden by the roof of the  aisle, runs below the screen and the windows, and between the two. The  mullions dividing the screen run straight up to the battlement. The tops  of the divisions are ornamented with cusped arches of open stonework.  There is a transom crossing the mullions of the screen about one-third  of the way up. It is difficult to say what was the object of this  screen. It must have been included in the original design, and so cannot  have been added afterwards to strengthen the walls. Whether it was a  merely decorative experiment or an architectural device for the purpose  of allowing the walls to be pierced with very large windows for the  display of glass cannot now be decided. The effect from the outside is  not good. The mullions break the surface into too many vertical lines,  and, with the transom, take away from the dignity and purity of outline  of the exterior. Inside, whether by a lucky chance or not, this screen,  by darkening the clerestory windows, has greatly added to the effect of  the wall of glass at the east end. There are also slight points of  difference in the clerestory windows, showing the transitional character  of those in the four eastern bays. The windows of the aisle are  delicately moulded with capitals to their shafts, and are ornamented  with a crocketed gable, ogee-shaped and topped with a prominent finial  rising just above the battlements of the aisle. These battlements are  pierced with cusped circles, below them is a cornice ornamented with  foliage. The buttresses of the aisles are decorated with gargoyles and  crowned with pinnacles of a considerable size with crocketed spires and  finials. The front of these pinnacles is ornamented with characteristic  Perpendicular panelling. The buttresses of the main wall are thin and  plain, and, with the pinnacles, much resemble those of the nave. The  battlements are of pierced stonework of a common Perpendicular pattern.  The eastern transepts do not project beyond the aisles. Their fronts  contain very long windows of five lights, each with three transoms. The  southern one has strong buttresses ornamented with panelling, and  gargoyles at the corners. The northern is much plainer. Their side  windows are like those of the clerestory. Britton conjectures that the  unfinished state of the stonework on the north side of the choir beneath  the window shows that a cloister or other low building was intended in  this part, which was never executed. The cornice, he says, under the  battlements is more perfect towards the western part and shows beautiful  foliage. The spouts are sculptured with bold projecting figures through  which the water is conveyed from the roofs.    [Illustration: Bay of Choir--Exterior.]    The east end of the cathedral is square. The great east window of nine  lights fills almost the whole of the central division. The buttresses  separating it from the aisle are decorated with six storeys of niches,  two to each storey, except the lowest, which contains only one. The east  window has an ogee gable above it, topped by a curious pierced pinnacle  at present in process of restoration. The ends, both of the aisles and  of the choir itself, are square, and do not reveal the roof behind them.  The arch of the great east window is surrounded with panelling, each  panel curiously broken at different heights by cusped arches. The aisle  windows have ogee gables above them with finials, and immediately above  them a band of panelling running right across the exterior buttresses.  These buttresses are large, and capped with lofty spires. The niches on  them contained statues of Vavasour and Percy. Below the east window are  the remains of sculpture representing Christ and His Apostles, Edward  III. (on the north), and Archbishop Thoresby (on the south). These have  suffered much in the frosts of recent winters. The square ends of both  choir and aisles are decorated with arches with crocketed gables above  them. Those of the south aisle differ from those of the north, being  fewer in number and wider. All the niches on the east front except those  mentioned have lost their statues.    There was certainly not very much opportunity for a fine architectural  design in this east end with its great wall of glass, but, allowing for  all disadvantages, it cannot be considered successful. There is no  justification for the square ends concealing the roof. They are  misrepresentations, and they are not beautiful. The decoration, with its  monotonous rows of panelling and niches, shows the poverty of invention  often characteristic of Perpendicular architects, and is sometimes  positively ugly. The whole east front must surprise most people by its  apparent smallness. It seems merely the end of an overgrown parish  church, and not of a great cathedral, and though that apparent smallness  is partly owing to the enormous size of the windows, which prevent any  structural division of parts, it is increased by the monotony and  shallowness of the decoration. It is almost impossible, in fact, to  believe that this is the east end of the loftiest and widest choir in  England. The buildings on the south side of the choir are the vestry,  the treasury, and the record room.    #The South Transept# has a front entirely different from that of the  north, though the sides are much the same. This front has three storeys  of windows. Below, on each side of the porch, are two lancet windows.  Above these are three more lancet windows, the central one of which,  wider than the others, is divided by a mullion, probably a later  insertion. These windows alternate with blind arches. On each side of  the windows are slender shafts with capitals, and dog-tooth moulding  runs round them and round the blank arches. Above these windows is a  large rose window of \"plate tracery\"--tracery, that is to say, in its  earlier form, in which the openings for the glass appear to have been  cut out of the stone rather than the stone to have been added as a frame  for the glass. This window is of a very elaborate design, and consists  of three circles, the outer being the circumference of the window; the  middle about equi-distant from the circumference and the centre, and  connected with the circumference by pillars, twenty-four in all, and  cusped arches; and the inner connected with the centre in the same way  and ornamented with cusps. The spaces between the arches of the middle  circle are pierced with trefoil holes, those between the outer arches  are pierced and filled with glass. The outer circle is ornamented with  three rows of dog-tooth moulding. Above this window, in the crown of the  gable, is a small three-cornered window ornamented also with dog-tooth  moulding. On either side of the rose window are small lancet windows  with smaller blind arches on each side of them. Both windows and arches  are surrounded also with dog-tooth moulding. An arcading with shafts and  cusped arches runs along the base of the front, not quite reaching the  exterior buttresses. In the centre is the porch by which entrance to the  minster is generally obtained. It is reached by an ascent of two flights  of steps. The porch is rather small, and not particularly remarkable  architecturally. It consists of a single arch supported by an outer and  inner group of clustered shafts. On each side of it is a small blind  arch. All three of these arches are decorated with dog-tooth moulding.  The interior of the porch is vaulted and decorated with blind arches.  Above this porch are three blind arches surrounded with heavy gables,  the middle and largest of which runs up to the lancet windows above it.  It is difficult to believe that these arches and gables are not an  addition later in date than the transept itself; they are so ugly and so  meaningless, but they appear in the old prints of the minster, and the  ancient clock, with two wooden statues in armour of the date of Henry  VII., seems to have stood there from time immemorial. This clock was  removed, with the statues, to make room for another at the beginning of  this century, and it appears that the arches and gables were also  altered, which may perhaps account for their present ugly appearance.  The clock is now in the north transept. It should be stated that the  whole of this front has been rather badly restored, and nearly all of  its beauty of detail is gone. The aisle fronts have upper storeys  ornamented with blind arches and an upper row of small lancet windows.  These upper storeys do not correspond with the roof of the aisle behind  them. The aisle windows are lancet, two to each aisle. The external  buttresses are large, ornamented with gables and blind arches, and the  other buttresses are of the same character.    [Illustration: South Transept--Porch.]    On the whole, the front of the north transept, though very rich in  ornament, is distinctly inferior to the front of the south. The rose  window is too large for its lofty position, and its elaborate tracery  and rich mouldings make it seem heavy. The lancet windows below it,  being too long and badly spaced, have rather a bald look, increased by  the richness of the rose window above them, and the porch is altogether  too"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19423"],[0,"The Story of Porcelain (#12)"],[1,"mane, and claws  like a lion. A Chinese artist would have scorned to copy a real dog,  for that would not have been considered art; nor would a picture of  any living type of dog be half as imposing as was this imaginary  creature with its fierce teeth, mane, and claws. Sometimes the  _Kylin_, a sort of stag with a dragon's head, and a symbol of  good-fortune, was used. There were many other of these symbolic  designs employed to enhance the beauty of Chinese porcelains, and of  course to the Chinese each one had its meaning.\"    \"It is an interesting idea, isn't it?\" Theo said slowly.    \"Very; and makes much of our own art seem pitifully thin. And when you  consider that the colors the Chinese used also had their meaning, as  did various geometric forms introduced, you can readily see how much  one must study to understand Chinese--and for that matter, Japanese  art; for the Japanese used much the same methods in decorating their  potteries and porcelains, although of course their symbolism  varied. With the Chinese green and vermilion were colors sacred to the  wall decorations of Emperors' houses; red typified fire; black, water;  green, wood; white, metal. Fire was also sometimes represented by a  circle, and the earth by a square. All this I tell you that you may  see how much thought went into everything they did. In addition  certain objects were made for especial purposes, and decorated in  accordance with their use. There were drinking cups for poets,  authors, and government officials, each cup having an appropriate  picture in the bottom. Then there were incense-burners, vases, bowls,  and vessels for libations at ceremonials; there were, too, statues of  the various gods. Besides these many types of workmanship the Chinese  made a very thin egg-shell porcelain, the most fragile and transparent  of which we now get from Japan; and a porcelain decorated with a fine,  open-work design cut through the ware, and styled 'grains-of-rice  pattern.' Moreover they manufactured a variety which in firing took on  a crackled effect and has for that reason been christened Chinese  Crackle. You see how many kinds of thing they worked out.\"    \"I should say so!\" exclaimed Theo.    \"Most of the painting of Chinese porcelain was done directly on the  glaze instead of underneath it, although some of the brush work was  done on the clay itself before the glaze was put over it. In either  case the ware required several firings, and before even such a simple  article as a cup was completed it frequently passed through as many as  seventy pairs of hands. Add to this the dangers risked in packing and  importing, and the tumult of the many wars that racked China, and is  it anything short of a marvel that so many perfect pieces of ancient  make have come down to us?\"    \"I think it is wonderful that all of them were not broken,\" gasped  Theo.    \"It is not until 1171 that there is any mention of porcelain being  seen outside of China. Then the Mohammedan Saladin sent as a present  to another ruler forty pieces of Chinese porcelain. In 1487 the Sultan  of Turkey gave to Lorenzo de Medici, a great art lover, a porcelain  vase. After that porcelain began, as I have already told you, to find  its way into Europe--first through the Portuguese traders, and later  through the Dutch. What we know of Chinese porcelain applies largely  to that of Japan, because for many years Japan was merely an imitator  of China so far as porcelain-making was concerned. By and by, however,  the Japanese Government encouraged the industry by giving money toward  its manufacture, and as a result about the year 1200 the porcelains of  the Japanese rivaled those of China. The Chrysanthemo-Paeonienne was  worked out to a degree of perfection hitherto unknown; and the  Famille-rose was also made, but not as perfectly as in China. The  Famille-vert, on the contrary, was not attempted to any extent in  Japan, probably because the Japanese lacked the necessary clays to  make it.\"    Mr. Croyden paused as if reflecting, then added:    \"As I explained to you, the Japanese had their symbolism of color and  design as well as the Chinese; and not only did they make similar  sorts of porcelain, but they subsequently invented styles of  decoration of their own. They did much medallion-painting, a form of  design unknown in China. They also gave to the world their wonderful  Japanese lacquer, a varnish of gums that could be applied not only to  wood but in some cases to porcelain. They also were the race to invent  Cloisonne ware, a very difficult type of thing when made as they made  it. To the surface of the porcelain they fastened a tiny metal outline  of the design and afterward filled in the spaces between it with  colored enamels. You can easily see what careful workmanship such a  process required.\"    \"We have a Cloisonne vase at home,\" said Theo soberly, \"but I never  knew it was made that way.\"    \"If it is the genuine old Japanese Cloisonne it was,\" answered  Mr. Croyden. \"The Japanese also gave us the Mandarin china so highly  prized by collectors. This is an interesting ware because on it we  find the tiny Mandarins pictured in the decoration, wearing their  little toques or caps topped with the button denoting their rank. You  see when the Thsing victors conquered the Ming Dynasty of China they  decreed that many of the old Chinese customs and modes of dress should  give place to those of Japan. Among other things they ordered that  officials wear the toque or mandarin-cap. The Chinese were, as you can  well imagine, very angry; and although they wore the cap you see no  little mandarins thus arrayed adorning their porcelain. But the  Japanese not only immortalized these reminders of their supremacy on  their chinaware, but they even took some of their mandarin-decorated  porcelain to China and forced the Chinese to buy it. In most  collections you will find some of this Mandarin china; but remember,  although it may have come from China, it probably was not made there.\"    Theo smiled.    \"The Japanese came in time to be great traders,\" continued  Mr. Croyden, \"and they are going to be still greater ones some  day. They invented many other kinds of pottery and porcelain which  they sold to the merchants of Holland. Satsuma is a pottery in which  they excelled. It has a body of cream-colored earthenware not unlike  Wedgwood's Queen's ware, and this is richly decorated in dull colors  and gold. In order to please the Dutch traders the Japanese even  painted angels, saints, and other Christian figures both on their  pottery and porcelain, which proves they must have been pretty eager  for European customers. At the present moment they are equally willing  to cater to American and European demands, and to gratify our  inartistic public by sending into our markets all sorts of cheap,  gaudily decorated goods which they themselves would not tolerate. It  is a deplorable fact, too, that we buy them. Now you surely have got  your money's worth of lecture for to-night. If you are not tired, I  am. Good-night, sonny!\"    \"Good-night,\" called Theo as Mr. Croyden passed out, \"and thank  you. I'm sorry you're tired. I am _not_. I could listen all over  again.\"          [Illustration]          CHAPTER VIII    THE THIRD FAMOUS POTTER      Theo's crutches did not arrive as soon as he expected, both because of  the remoteness of the camp and a confusion in transportation.    Poor Theo! After getting his hopes up it was hard to be cheerful over  this disappointment, and the courage that until now had buoyed him up  suddenly began to fail.    \"I just wish one of those miserable expressmen could have a broken leg  and then he'd see how good it is to be laid up like this,\" fretted the  boy indignantly.    \"Oh, come, don't wish that!\" Mr. Croyden protested laughing, \"for if  you decree that the expressmen be disabled you will never get your  crutches.\"    \"I suppose not,\" admitted Theo grudgingly. \"But it is so irritating.\"    \"I know that; still, it might be worse, Theo. You really are pretty  comfortable, you know.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"You are not suffering.\"    \"No,\" murmured the lad, hanging his head.    \"You have plenty to eat.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And the food is good.\"    Theo flushed, but said nothing.    \"There is many a boy worse off than you are.\"    \"Probably.\"    \"I guess your father could show you a score of them were you to  accompany him on one of his hospital rounds. Suppose, for example, you  were in pain every moment, and were never to walk again. That would be  a real calamity, and something to fuss about.\"    Theo raised his eyes.    \"I know it, sir,\" he said instantly. \"I'm afraid I have been pretty  grumpy and cross.\"    \"No. Until now you have been most patient--phenomenally patient for a  lad who loves to be doing something every minute. It is precisely  because you have done so well that I'd like you to hold out a little  longer.\"    Theo's lip quivered; then suddenly his scowl melted into a mischievous  smile.    \"I believe, Mr. Croyden, that you are as good at preaching as you are  at lecturing,\" he observed gaily.    Mr. Croyden nodded his head.    \"You are one of the few persons, Theo, who appreciate me at my full  value. I am really a very gifted person if only other people suspected  it. In return for your recognition of my talents I have half a mind to  favor you with another of my celebrated lectures this very instant.\"    \"I wish you would,\" came eagerly from Theo. \"But aren't you going off  fishing this morning?\"    \"No. Your father and Manuel are going to fish some secret trout hole,  and they did not invite me. You see, your father's guide and mine are  the best of friends until it comes to trout holes; then they are sworn  enemies.
