Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the  forest. Squirrels were chattering, birds singing, and overhead honked  the wild-fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the  air.    From every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of  unseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping. The Yukon  was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. It ate away  from beneath; the sun ate from above. Air-holes formed, fissures sprang  and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into  the river. And amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening  life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like  wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.    With the dogs falling, Mercedes weeping and riding, Hal swearing  innocuously, and Charles's eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into  John Thornton's camp at the mouth of White River. When they halted,  the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. Mercedes  dried her eyes and looked at John Thornton. Charles sat down on a log  to rest. He sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great  stiffness. Hal did the talking. John Thornton was whittling the last  touches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. He whittled  and listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse  advice. He knew the breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that  it would not be followed.    \"They told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and  that the best thing for us to do was to lay over,\" Hal said in response  to Thornton's warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice. \"They  told us we couldn't make White River, and here we are.\" This last with a  sneering ring of triumph in it.    \"And they told you true,\" John Thornton answered. \"The bottom's likely  to drop out at any moment. Only fools, with the blind luck of fools,  could have made it. I tell you straight, I wouldn't risk my carcass on  that ice for all the gold in Alaska.\"    \"That's because you're not a fool, I suppose,\" said Hal. \"All the same,  we'll go on to Dawson.\" He uncoiled his whip. \"Get up there, Buck! Hi!  Get up there! Mush on!\"    Thornton went on whittling. It was idle, he knew, to get between a fool  and his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter the  scheme of things.    But the team did not get up at the command. It had long since passed  into the stage where blows were required to rouse it. The whip flashed  out, here and there, on its merciless errands. John Thornton compressed  his lips. Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. Teek followed.  Joe came next, yelping with pain. Pike made painful efforts. Twice he  fell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. Buck  made no effort. He lay quietly where he had fallen. The lash bit into  him again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. Several times  Thornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. A moisture  came into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked  irresolutely up and down.    This was the first time Buck had failed, in itself a sufficient reason  to drive Hal into a rage. He exchanged the whip for the customary club.  Buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell upon  him. Like his mates, he was barely able to get up, but, unlike them, he  had made up his mind not to get up. He had a vague feeling of impending  doom. This had been strong upon him when he pulled in to the bank, and  it had not departed from him. What of the thin and rotten ice he had  felt under his feet all day, it seemed that he sensed disaster close at  hand, out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying to drive  him. He refused to stir. So greatly had he suffered, and so far gone was  he, that the blows did not hurt much. And as they continued to fall upon  him, the spark of life within flickered and went down. It was nearly  out. He felt strangely numb. As though from a great distance, he was  aware that he was being beaten. The last sensations of pain left him. He  no longer felt anything, though very faintly he could hear the impact of  the club upon his body. But it was no longer his body, it seemed so far  away.    And then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was  inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang  upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as  though struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on  wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his  stiffness.    John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, too  convulsed with rage to speak.    \"If you strike that dog again, I'll kill you,\" he at last managed to say  in a choking voice.    \"It's my dog,\" Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came  back. \"Get out of my way, or I'll fix you. I'm going to Dawson.\"    Thornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting  out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed,  cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.  Thornton rapped Hal's knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife  to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up.  Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck's  traces.    Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, his hands were full with his  sister, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of  further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out  from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head  to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were  Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the  loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in  the rear.    As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly  hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed  nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the  sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along  over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut,  and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. Mercedes's  scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to  run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans  disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The bottom had  dropped out of the trail.    John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.    \"You poor devil,\" said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.          Chapter VI. For the Love of a Man      When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners  had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves  up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still  limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued  warm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the river  bank through the long spring days, watching the running water, listening  lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck slowly won back  his strength.    A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles,  and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his  muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For  that matter, they were all loafing,--Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet  and Nig,--waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to  Dawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with  Buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first  advances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a  mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck's  wounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast,  she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her  ministrations as much as he did for Thornton's. Nig, equally friendly,  though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and  half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.    To Buck's surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him. They  seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of John Thornton. As Buck  grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games, in  which Thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion  Buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence. Love,  genuine passionate love, was his for the first time. This he had never  experienced at Judge Miller's down in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley.  With the Judge's sons, hunting and tramping, it had been a working  partnership; with the Judge's grandsons, a sort of pompous guardianship;  and with the Judge himself, a stately and dignified friendship. But love  that was feverish and burning, that was adoration, that was madness, it  had taken John Thornton to arouse.    This man had saved his life, which was something; but, further, he was  the ideal master. Other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a  sense of duty and business expediency; he saw to the welfare of his as  if they were his own children, because he could not help it. And he saw  further. He never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word, and to  sit down for a long talk with them (\"gas\" he called it) was as much his  delight as theirs. He had a way of taking Buck's head roughly between  his hands, and resting his own head upon Buck's, of shaking him back  and forth, the while calling him ill names that to Buck were love  names. Buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21511"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Priory Church of St. Bartholomew-the-Great, Smithfield (#12)"],[1,"a Christian church  there--probably on the site of a temple to the god--which was named  after St. Bartholomew, on the supposition that it contained the saint's  relics.[1] Below the church there are the remains of the old travertine  ramparts which gave the island the appearance of a ship on which the  edifice was resting--a fanciful picture of the \"Navis Ecclesiae\" as  reproduced in the twelfth century Priory seal. (_Vide_ Fig. C, page 73)  The combination of a hospital with a church, suggested by the island and  the vision, was realized in Rahere's double foundation on his return to  England. Until the time of the Dissolution the corporate body of the  hospital, and the staff for attendance upon the patients, were  identical, and consisted of a master, eight brethren, and four sisters,  all living in obedience to the Augustinian rule. Unfortunately no record  is preserved of the grant of the site, or of the deed of endowment; but  a Charter granted by Henry I in 1133 is extant, conferring certain  privileges on the church, prior, canons, and poor of the hospital.  (_Vide ante_ chap. i.) The annexation of the hospital to the priory was  subsequently confirmed by a Charter of King John in the fifth year of  his reign, which remained in force without material change till the  separation effected under Henry VIII. The connection involved the  presentation of each newly elected Master to the Prior of St.  Bartholomew's, or, if he refused institution, to the Bishop of London;  the assent of the prior and canons being, however, required before any  one could become a member of the Hospital Society. The Act of 1539  superseded all previous legislation affecting the monastic foundations;  the Priory and Hospital were separated; and the revenues of both  transferred to the royal exchequer. But on the petition of Sir Richard  Gresham, Lord Mayor of London, and father of Sir Thomas Gresham, the  Hospital was refounded by royal charter--27th December, 1546, 38 Henry  VIII--which restored the greater part of its former revenues, in  consideration of        the miserable estate of the poore, aged, sick, low, and impotent      people, as well men as women, lying and going about begging in      the common streets of the said City of London and the suburbs of      the same, to the great paine and sorrowe of the same poore,      aged, sick, and impotent people, and to the great infection,      hurt, and annoyance of His Grace's loving subjects, which of      necessity must daily goe and pass by the same poore, sick, low,      and impotent people, being infected with divers great and      horrible sicknesses and diseases.    The Indenture goes on to convey to the mayor, commonalty, and citizens  of London the buildings formerly belonging to the Grey Friars as well as        the late Hospital of St. Bartholomew, in West Smithfield,      otherwise called the Hospital of Little St. Bartholomew, and the      Church of the same, and all the manors, parsonages, messuages,      lands, tithes, advowsons, and hereditaments, late part of the      possession of the said Hospital    with certain specified exceptions which the charity had to lose, and  no longer form part of its history. The immediate result was that the  Church of the Grey Friars became the parish church of Christ Church,  Newgate, and the chapel pertaining to the hospital (the survivor of  four, three of which were alienated) the parish church of Little St.  Bartholomew, now more familiarly known as St. Bartholomew-the-Less. Two  priests were then attached to it, one called the vicar, who was granted  a mansion and a stipend of _L13 6s. 8d._ per annum; the other, the  hospitaller or visitor, whose stipend was fixed at _L10_. The  accommodation of the hospital at that time was for one hundred poor men  and women, lodging within it, under the superintendence of a single  matron, with twelve women assistants. It is interesting to compare these  figures with those of the present day, when the hospital contains as  many as six hundred and seventy beds, with three hundred and fifty  nurses on the staff, and every year relieves over one hundred and fifty  thousand poor sick people, besides maintaining a convalescent home, with  seventy beds, at Kettlewell, Swanley, Kent.[2]    [Illustration: ST. BARTHOLOMEW-THE-LESS                 _E. Scamell. Photo._]    The hospital chapel, converted into a parish church after the  Dissolution, had fallen into a very dilapidated state towards the end of  the eighteenth century. In the year 1789 the restoration of the building  was committed to Mr. George Dance, then architect and surveyor to the  hospital. He made a considerable alteration in the interior by  ruthlessly destroying the old work, for which he substituted an  octagonal structure, within the rectangular plan, allowing the external  walls to remain in their original form, with the square tower which  still stands at the western end--the whole enveloped in a coating of  cement. The internal erection was entirely in wood, ingeniously carved  and coloured to resemble stone; but the false economy of it was soon  manifested in dry-rot, which spread to such an alarming extent that a  reconstruction became necessary. The rebuilding was taken in hand in  1823 by Mr. Thomas Hardwick, who had a much better knowledge of pointed  architecture than his predecessor. He removed the whole of the timber,  substituting stone and iron for it, and while adhering to Mr. Dance's  general design, improved upon it by introducing fresh details of his  own, more in harmony with the fabric in which it was enclosed. The  church has since been restored, but the incongruity is still obvious  enough, especially from the outside, where the octagon projects above  the ancient walls, and the small pentagonal chancel beyond them at the  eastern end.    [Illustration: BRASS OF WILLIAM AND ALICE MARKEBY]    The entrance is by a low Tudor doorway in the tower, which still bears  traces of the original work. On the pavement of the vestibule there is  an interesting brass, with the figures of William Markeby and his wife,  and an inscription which now reads: \"Hic jacent Will'mo Markeby de  Londiniis gentlemo' qui obiit XI die Julii A. D'ni MCCCCXXXIX et Alicia  uxor ei,\" the concluding words \"quorum animabus propitietur Deus. Amen\"  having been erased.[3] There are two other ancient memorials in this  part of the church which call for special notice, viz.: on the north  wall, within the present vestry, a niche contains the figure of an angel  bearing a shield of arms, beneath which another shield, surmounted by a  crown, and upheld by two angels, displays the arms of Edward the  Confessor impaled with those of England. And against the western wall  there is a good example of a canopied altar-tomb, in the Tudor style,  with a memorial tablet (1741) inserted in it, which is obviously much  later than the tomb itself. This is said to have originally stood at the  eastern end of the south wall, where it was discovered during the  eighteenth century reconstruction, and then deprived of its ornamental  projections, where the marks of the chisel are seen upon the surface.    [Illustration: ANCIENT SCULPTURED TABLETS IN ST. BARTHOLOMEW-THE-LESS                 WEST END OF NORTH WALL]    At the eastern end of the north wall there is a tablet to the memory of  the wife of Sir Thomas Bodley, whose name has been given to the famous  library at Oxford. The curious old stone beneath it, which was  discovered during the alterations, and then affixed to the wall, has the  double interest of great antiquity and a puzzling inscription beginning,  \"_Ecce sub hoc tumulo Guliemus conditur_.\"    The exterior of the church, though spoilt by the composition laid over  the walls, has still a certain interest as part of the original fabric,  and still contains the arches of most of the old windows, viz., three on  each side, one at the west end, another immediately over the doorway,  and four in the uppermost storey of the tower. There were originally  four windows on each side, but those in the easternmost bays have been  removed, and the spaces filled up. Besides containing the memorials  above mentioned, the vestibule has more architectural interest than any  other part of the building in the surviving arches on the northern and  eastern sides of the space beneath the tower. Here there is an  aggregation of columns, with moulded bases and capitals, and banded in  the centre, varied by the introduction of half-length shafts resting on  sculptured corbels. The central area is nearly square, but has been  formed into an octagon by an arcading, on a series of clustered columns,  from each of which spring the moulded ribs of the ceiling. These ribs  are of Bath stone, and after an elaborate intertwining, are brought  together above in a central boss, from which hangs a large brass corona  to light the church. The roof is of iron, the panels within the groining  being overlaid with plaster. Above the main arcade there is a clerestory  of dwarfed windows, filled with tinted glass in an ornamental framework,  as are also the side windows, excepting those nearest the east. These  display a selection of Scripture miracles. There are three painted  windows over the altar, the central containing scenes from the life of  Christ, those to the north and south representing the Old and New  Testaments respectively. To the north of the recess forming the  sanctuary there is an alabaster pulpit,[4] and on the south stands a  small organ.    Services are held at eleven and five o'clock on Sundays, and the church  is open every day for private devotion. It is provided with seats to  accommodate about 200 people. The present vicar and hospitaller is the  Rev. Herbert Skillicorn Close, M.A.      FOOTNOTES:     [1] St. Bartholomew was first interred at Albanopolis, in       Greater Armenia, the scene of his passion, and his remains were       afterwards"]]]
