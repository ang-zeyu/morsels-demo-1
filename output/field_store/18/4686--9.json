Our sugar bowls were called  sugar boxes and sugar pots; milk pitchers were milk jugs, milk ewers,  and milk pots. Vegetable dishes were called basins, pudding dishes  twifflers, small cups were called sneak cups.    We have still to-day a custom much like one of olden times, when we have  the crumbs removed from our tables after a course at dinner. Then a  voider was passed around the table near the close of the dinner, and  into it the persons at the table placed their trenchers, napkins, and  the crumbs from the table. The voider was a deep wicker, wooden, or  metal basket. In the _Boke of Nurture_, written in 1577, are these  lines:--        \"When meate is taken quyte awaye        And Voyders in presence,      Put you your trenchour in the same        and all your resydence.      Take you with your napkin & knyfe        the croms that are fore the,      In the Voyder your Napkin leave        for it is a curtesye.\"          CHAPTER V    FOOD FROM FOREST AND SEA      Though all the early explorers and travellers came to America eager to  find precious and useful metals, they did not discover wealth and  prosperity underground in mines, but on the top of the earth, in the  woods and fields. To the forests they turned for food, and they did not  turn in vain. Deer were plentiful everywhere, and venison was offered by  the Indians to the first who landed from the ships. Some families lived  wholly on venison for nine months of the year. In Virginia were vast  numbers of red and fallow deer, the latter like those of England, except  in the smaller number of branches of the antlers. They were so devoid of  fear as to remain undisturbed by the approach of men; a writer of that  day says: \"Hard by the Fort two hundred in one herd have been usually  observed.\" They were destroyed ruthlessly by a system of fire-hunting,  in which tracts of forests were burned over, by starting a continuous  circle of fire miles around, which burnt in toward the centre of the  circle; thus the deer were driven into the middle, and hundreds were  killed. This miserable, wholesale slaughter was not for venison, but for  the sake of the hides, which were very valuable. They were used to make  the durable and suitable buckskin breeches and jackets so much worn by  the settlers; and they were also exported to Europe in large numbers. A  tax was placed on hides for the support of the beloved William and Mary  College.    In Georgia, in 1735, the Indians sold a deer for sixpence. Deer were  just as abundant in the more Northern colonies. At Albany a stag was  sold readily by the Indians for a jack-knife or a few iron nails. The  deer in winter came and fed from the hog-pens of Albany swine. Even in  1695, a quarter of venison could be bought in New York City for  ninepence. At the first Massachusetts Thanksgiving, in 1621, the Indians  brought in five deer to the colonists for their feast. That year there  was also \"great store of wild turkies.\" These beautiful birds of gold  and purple bronze were at first plentiful everywhere, and were of great  weight, far larger than our domestic turkeys to-day. They came in flocks  of a hundred, Evelyn says of three hundred on the Chesapeake, and they  weighed thirty or forty pounds each: Josselyn says he saw one weighing  sixty pounds. William Penn wrote that turkeys weighing thirty pounds  apiece sold in his day and colony for a shilling only. They were shy  creatures and fled inland from the white man, and by 1690 were rarely  shot near the coast of New England, though in Georgia, in 1733, they  were plentiful enough and cheap enough to sell for fourpence apiece.  Flights of pigeons darkened the sky, and broke down the limbs of trees  on which they lighted. From Maine to Virginia these vast flocks were  seen. Some years pigeons were so plentiful that they were sold for a  penny a dozen in Boston. Pheasant, partridge, woodcock, and quail  abounded, plover, snipe, and curlew were in the marsh-woods; in fact, in  Virginia every bird familiar to Englishmen at home was found save  peacock and domestic fowl.    Wild hare and squirrels were so many that they became pests, and so much  grain was eaten by them that bounties were paid in many towns for the  heads of squirrels. County treasuries were exhausted by these premiums.  The Swedish traveller, Kalm, said that in Pennsylvania in one year,  1749, L8000 was paid out for heads of black and gray squirrels, at  threepence a head, which would show that over six hundred thousand were  killed.    From the woods came a sweet food-store, one specially grateful when  sugar was so scarce and so high-priced,--wild honey, which the colonists  eagerly gathered everywhere from hollow tree-trunks. Curiously enough,  the traveller, Kalm, insisted that bees were not native in America, but  were brought over by the English; that the Indians had no name for them  and called them English flies.    Governor Berkeley of Virginia, writing in 1706, called the maple the  sugar-tree; he said:--         \"The Sugar-Tree yields a kind of Sap or Juice which by boiling is       made into Sugar. This Juice is drawn out, by wounding the Trunk of       the Tree, and placing a Receiver under the Wound. It is said that       the Indians make one Pound of Sugar out of eight Pounds of the       Liquor. It is bright and moist with a full large Grain, the       Sweetness of it being like that of good Muscovada.\"    The sugar-making season was ever hailed with delight by the boys of the  household in colonial days, who found in this work in the woods a  wonderful outlet for the love of wild life which was strong in them. It  had in truth a touch of going a-gypsying, if any work as hard as  sugaring-off could have anything common with gypsy life. The maple-trees  were tapped as soon as the sap began to run in the trunk and showed at  the end of the twigs; this was in late winter if mild, or in the  earliest spring. A notch was cut in the trunk of the tree at a  convenient height from the ground, usually four or five feet, and the  running sap was guided by setting in the notch a semicircular basswood  spout cut and set with a special tool called a tapping-gauge. In earlier  days the trees were \"boxed,\" that is, a great gash cut across the side  and scooped out and down to gather the sap. This often proved fatal to  the trees, and was abandoned. A trough, usually made of a butternut log  about three feet long, was dug out, Indian fashion, and placed under the  end of the spout. These troughs were made deep enough to hold about ten  quarts. In later years a hole was bored in the tree with an augur; and  sap-buckets were used instead of troughs.    Sometimes these troughs were left in distant sugar-camps from year to  year, turned bottom side up, through the summer and winter. It was more  thrifty and tidy, however, to carry them home and store them. When this  was done, the men and boys began work by drawing the troughs and spouts  and provisions to the woods on hand-sleds. Sometimes a mighty man took  in a load on his back. It is told of John Alexander of Brattleboro,  Vermont, that he once went into camp _upon snowshoes_ carrying for three  miles one five-pail iron kettle, two sap-buckets, an axe and trappings,  a knapsack, four days' provisions, and a gun and ammunition.    The master of ceremonies--the owner of the camp--selected the trees and  drove the spouts, while the boys placed the troughs. Then the snow had  to be shovelled away on a level spot about eighteen or twenty feet  square, in which strong forked sticks were set twelve feet apart. Or the  ground was chosen so that two small low-spreading and strong trees could  be trimmed and used as forks. A heavy green stick was placed across from  fork to fork, and the sugaring-off kettles, sometimes five in number,  hung on it. Then dry wood had to be gathered for the fires; hard work it  was to keep them constantly supplied. It was often cut a year in  advance. As the sap collected in the troughs it was gathered in pails or  buckets which, hung on a sap-yoke across the neck, were brought to the  kettles and the sap set a-boiling down. When there was a \"good run of  sap,\" it was usually necessary to stay in the camp over night. Many  times the campers stayed several nights. As the \"good run\" meant milder  weather, a night or two was not a bitter experience; indeed, I have  never heard any one speak nor seen any account of a night spent in a  sugar-camp except with keen expressions of delight. If possible, the  time was chosen during a term of moonlight; the snow still covered the  fields and its pure shining white light could be seen through the trees.        \"God makes sech nights, so white and still        Fer's you can look and listen.      Moonlight an' snow, on field and hill,        All silence and all glisten.\"    The great silence, broken only by steady dropping of the sap, the  crackle of blazing brush, and the occasional hooting of startled owls;  the stars seen singly overhead through the openings of the trees,  shining down the dark tunnel as bright as though there were no moon;  above all, the clearness and sweetness of the first atmosphere of  spring,--gave an exaltation of the senses and spirit which the country  boy felt without understanding, and indeed without any formulated  consciousness.    If the camp were near enough to any group of farmhouses to have  visitors, the last afternoon and evening in camp was made a country  frolic. Great sled-loads of girls came out to taste the new sugar, to  drop it into the snow to candy, and to have an evening of fun.    Long ere the full riches of the forests were tested the colonists turned  to another food-supply,--the treasures of the sea.    The early voyagers and colonists came to the coasts of the New World to  find gold and furs. The gold was not found by them nor their children's  children in the land which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22677"],[0,"Greece and the Allies, 1914-1922 (#12)"],[1,"contrary to her own.[23]    The Entente Ministers at Athens, as was natural, had greater  opportunities of displaying their solidarity with M. Venizelos.  They  would perhaps have been better advised had they followed the example of  their colleagues at Rome.  It can hardly be questioned that the  discreet and decorous aloofness of the Entente diplomats from the  long-protracted struggle between the Italian advocates of war and  neutrality, assisted by Prince von Buelow's indiscreet and indecorous  participation in that struggle, facilitated a decision in our favour:  nothing does so much to alienate a high-spirited nation as an attempt  on the part of outsiders to direct its internal affairs.  In Greece the  need for discretion was even more imperative.  All controversy at such  a juncture was injudicious.  But if preference had to be shown, it  would have been better to have taken the King's side, for all that was  valuable to us from the military point of view rallied round him; and,  in any case, since the hopes of the Venizelists for oversea expansion  depended on the goodwill of the Sea Powers, {48} they were tied to us  securely enough: so if the land school represented by the General Staff  could have been satisfied, the country would have remained united and  on our side.  Instead of adopting this sane attitude, the local agents  of the Entente ostentatiously associated themselves with the  Venizelists and boycotted the others, thus gratuitously contributing to  a cleavage from which only our enemies could profit.    And that was not all.  Having begun by endeavouring to influence the  Greeks, they ended by being entirely influenced by them.  Forgetting  that no correct perception of facts or estimate of motives is possible  without a certain mental detachment, they allowed themselves to be  swallowed up, as it were, in the atmosphere of suspicion and slander  generated by party friction: they ceased to have any eyes, ears, or  minds of their own; they saw and heard just what M. Venizelos willed  them to see and hear, and thought just as M. Venizelos willed them to  think.  If the King refused to enter the War, his refusal was inspired  by the desire to serve the Kaiser; if he offered to do so, his offers  were prompted by the desire to dish M. Venizelos.[24]    Hence, every proposal made to the Entente by M. Venizelos's successors  was rejected.  Greece was kept out of the Allies' camp, and Servia was  sacrificed.  For it should be clearly understood that the fate of  Servia was decided in the months of June and July, 1915, not only by  the development of the Germano-Bulgarian plan, but also by the failure  of all co-operative counter-measures on the part of the Serbs, Greeks,  and Entente Powers while time was still available.  If only there had  been anyone of sufficient authority and independence of view to  correlate and compose the clashing interests of the moment, a gallant  ally might have been saved from destruction.  But those best qualified  to judge of what was coming, and in a position to frame the  corresponding policy, had been driven into reserve by the storm of  calumny, whereby their motives were misconstrued, their counsels  derided, and their authority undermined; so that in the general uproar  their voices were scarcely heard.  And there were none--or {49} very  few--to act as intermediaries; for the personnel of the Entente  Legations, \"wholly believing a lie,\" had withdrawn in a body from all  intercourse with them, had nicknamed them \"Boches,\" and were accustomed  to assess as concocted in Berlin every notion that emanated from them.  Even the few members of those Legations who had the moral courage to  walk the streets without blinkers were subjected to every form of  odious insinuation and attack.  Venizelos in office, out of office, on  matters technical or lay, to him and to him only would anyone listen,  and as he knew rather less about the rudiments of the military art than  most people, and refrained from consulting those that did, the results  were not difficult to predict.    Yet, as late as June, the elements of a good plan were ready to hand in  abundance.  The General Staff was, as stated, continuing its efforts  for co-operation with the Serbs.  The King, though too ill to conduct  business, would have assented to any military proposal put forward by  the General Staff.  The people would have followed the King as one man.  And the enemy were not ready.  All that was necessary was to study with  attention and sympathy the advice of the experts: to call the soldiers  of the countries concerned to council, and to inaugurate a joint  campaign.  It was not done--and it is difficult to say now to whom the  failure proved most disastrous--to Servia, to Greece, or to the Entente  Powers.  But for this failure a proportionate share of blame must be  laid upon those who, instead of striving to heal divisions in Greece,  did everything they could to foment them.

[4] The best proof is to be found in the Venizelist _White Book_, No.  36,--an exhaustive memorandum by M. Streit on the probabilities of the  War, dated 13/26 March, 1915.  It is both striking and illuminating  that, while in dealing with the attitude of Bulgaria, the author  considers three alternatives: (1) Bulgaria in alliance with the  Entente.  (2) Bulgaria as neutral.  (3) Bulgaria as an enemy of the  Entente.  In dealing with the attitude of Greece he does not for a  single moment contemplate more than two alternatives: (1) Greece as an  ally of the Entente.  (2) Greece as neutral.  Further, in the course of  the argument which follows, M. Streit discusses a possible  understanding between Greece on the one part and Rumania and Bulgaria  on the other, with the object either of a common neutrality or, failing  that, of a simultaneous entry into war in favour of the Entente, \"on  whose side alone we can range ourselves.\"    [5] See the _Nea Hellas_, 22 March (O.S.), 1915.

Delcasse, then and for months afterwards, strove to gain over  Bulgaria _coute que coute_, deploring the possession of Cavalla by  Greece.  See Deville, pp. 163, 218.

[21] See the _Nea Hellas_, 20, 21 March (O.S.), 1915; _Orations,  passim_.    [22] _Journal Officiel_, p. 76.  To appreciate the community of  sentiments between M. Venizelos and M. Delcasse fully, one must compare  the above statement with that in _Orations_, pp. 68-9.  The differences  are equally instructive.  The Venizelist orator, prudently suppresses  from a Greek audience the fact that his Chief frustrated the General  Staff's efforts to co-operate with Servia; he boldly surmises, on the  other hand, that behind the General Staff's stipulations as to the  sphere of Greek military action lurked the _arriere pensee_ to confront  the Allies with the risk of provoking Bulgaria, whom they still  regarded as a potential friend: so the stipulations were, as they were  intended to be, unacceptable.  Again, while M. Delcasse, addressing a  French audience nervous about the Western Front, reckoned that the  Entente contingents demanded by the Greek General Staff would amount to  at least 600,000 or 800,000 men, M. Politis, less fantastically,  estimates them at 450,000 men: this force, which Greece deemed  necessary for success, it will be seen, was not far removed from that  which France and England eventually wasted in failure.

Venizelos returned to power as a result of the General  Elections held on June 13.  The outcome of those elections proved how  great his popularity still was.  True, in 1910 he had obtained 146  seats out of 182, and now only 185 out of 314.  But the majority,  though diminished, remained substantial enough to show that he still  was, for most people, the man who had cleansed Greece.  Nor did M.  Venizelos imperil his popularity by revealing his differences with the  King.  On the contrary, in his own country, his attacks were carefully  confined to the statesmen and soldiers opposed to him: the King, M.  Venizelos proclaimed, far from sharing their narrow, unpatriotic,  pro-German views, \"did not exclude exit from neutrality under given  conditions, but"]]]
