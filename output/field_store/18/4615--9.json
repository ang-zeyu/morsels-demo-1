I believe, Purchase, that you were cut adrift last night, either by the  individual who spun the yarn, or by some emissary or emissaries of his  who have a lurking-place somewhere in this neighbourhood; and, if the  truth could be got at, I believe it would be found that the schooner  which we saw come out of this river on the day before yesterday--and  which the captain was led to believe was a decoy intended to draw us off  the coast--was actually chock-full of slaves!\"    \"By Jove!\" ejaculated Purchase.  \"What a very extraordinary idea!\"    \"I don't think so at all,\" cut in Hoskins, before Mr Perry could reply.  \"It may seem so to you, Purchase, because it has just been presented to  you, fresh and unexpectedly, as it were.  But when we arrived at King  Olomba's town yesterday morning, and found neither slaves nor barracoon  there, I must confess that I was visited by some such suspicion as that  of which Captain Perry has just been speaking, although in my case it  did not take quite such a concrete and connected form.  To my mind there  is only one thing against your theory, sir,\" he continued, turning to  the skipper, \"and that is the existence of the factory on the lagoon.\"    \"Yes,\" agreed the captain, \"I admit that to be somewhat difficult to  account for.  And yet, perhaps not so very difficult either; because if  the fellows who gave Captain Harrison the information upon which he  acted happened to have a grudge against the owners of that factory they  would naturally be more than glad if, while groping about in search of  the imaginary slavers and barracoon, we should stumble upon the real  thing and destroy it.  All this, however, is mere idle conjecture, which  may be either well founded or the opposite; but there is one  indisputable fact about this business, which is--unless Mr Purchase is  altogether mistaken, which I do not for a moment believe--that the  _Psyche_ was last night cut adrift from her anchors and wrecked by  somebody who must have a lurking-place in this immediate neighbourhood;  and I intend to have a hunt for that somebody to-morrow.\"        CHAPTER FIVE.    THE BATTLE OF THE SAND SPIT.    As the evening progressed it became evident to me that our new captain  had developed a very preoccupied mood; he fell into long fits of  abstraction; and often answered very much at random such remarks as  happened to be addressed to him.  He appeared to be turning over some  puzzling matter in his mind; and at length that matter came to the  surface and found expression in speech.    \"Mr Purchase,\" he said, \"I have been trying to put two and two  together--or, in other words, I have been endeavouring to find an  explanation of the puzzle which this business of the wreck of the  _Psyche_ presents.  I can understand quite clearly that poor Captain  Harrison was deliberately deceived and misled by certain persons in  Sierra Leone in order that the ship might be cast away.  But why _here_  particularly?  For if my theory be correct that the supposed decoy  schooner actually sailed out of this river with a full cargo of black  ivory, there must certainly be a barracoon somewhere close at hand from  which she drew her supplies; and the people who planned the destruction  of the sloop could scarcely have been so short-sighted as to have  overlooked the fact that such a happening would leave us here stranded  in close proximity to a slave factory which, presumably, they would be  most anxious should remain undiscovered by us.  That is the point which  I cannot understand; and I have come to the conclusion that my theory  with regard to the schooner must be altogether wrong, or there must be  something else in the wind--that, in short, the wreck of the sloop is  only a part instead of the whole of their plan.\"    \"But what about the barracoon which you destroyed to-day, sir?\" asked  Purchase.  \"Might not that be the place from which those fellows draw  their supplies of slaves?\"    \"It might, of course,\" admitted the skipper; \"but, all the same, I do  not believe it was.  For the people who supplied Captain Harrison with  false information would surely know enough of him and his methods to be  certain that, failing to find anything in the nature of a slave factory  at King Olomba's town, we should not leave the river again until we had  thoroughly explored it; and if they knew the river at all they would  also know that the factory on the Camma Lagoon could scarcely be  overlooked by us.  No; in my own mind I feel convinced that the factory  which we destroyed to-day was not the one in which those fellows are  interested; there is another one somewhere in the river; and I will not  leave until I have discovered and destroyed it.  But that only brings me  back to the point from which I started, and once more raises the  question, Why did they cast us away within a few miles of this other  factory which I am persuaded exists?  Is it that the place is so  strongly fortified that they are confident of our inability to take it?  Or is there something else at the back of it all, of which we have not  yet got an inkling?\"    Purchase shook his head hopelessly.  \"Upon my word, sir,\" he answered,  \"it is quite impossible for me to say.  When you come to put the matter  like that it becomes as inexplicable as a Chinese puzzle.  What is your  own opinion?\"    \"I haven't been able to form one at all,\" answered the skipper.  \"But  the matter is puzzling enough to convince me that it would be folly on  our part to assume that the casting away of the ship is the beginning  and ending of the adventure; therefore we will neglect no precautions,  Mr Purchase, lest we find ourselves landed in an even worse predicament  than our present one.  Our first and most important precaution must be  to maintain a strict watch throughout the night.  It need not be a very  strong watch, but it must be a vigilant one; therefore each watch will  be kept under the supervision of an officer who will be responsible for  the vigilance of the men under him.  Moreover, all hands must see that  their muskets and pistols are loaded and ready for instant action; for  it would not be a very difficult matter to surprise this camp of ours  sometime during the small hours.  Just come outside with me and let us  take a look round.\"    The result of the above conversation and the \"look round\" was an  arrangement that the night was to be divided into five watches of two  hours each, beginning at eight o'clock in the evening and ending at six  o'clock in the morning; each watch to consist of twelve men, fully  armed, who were to act as sentries, half of them being detailed to watch  the river in the neighbourhood of the boats, while the other half kept  watch and ward over the land approach to our encampment, being stretched  across the narrow isthmus in open order from the water's edge on the  river-side to that on the sea-side.  Each watch was commanded by an  officer, with a midshipman under him; and the general orders were to  fire a single shot at the first sign of anything of an alarming  character, and then retire upon the camp, if an attack should threaten  to cut off the outpost from the main body.    The first watch was taken by the captain, with me for his subordinate;  and I was given the command of the party of six guarding the shore  approach to the camp, while the skipper took the party mounting guard  near the boats, as it was his opinion that if danger threatened it was  most likely to come by way of the river.    My instructions were to march my men out to a distance of not more than  two cables' lengths from the camp, and there take such cover as might be  possible.  At first sight it did not appear that there was the least bit  of cover of any description available, for the spit or peninsula on  which we were encamped was just bare sand for a distance of fully a mile  from the spot whereon our camp was pitched, and then there began a  growth of scrubby bush which gradually became more dense as one  proceeded in a southerly direction; but I solved the difficulty by  causing each man to scoop a little pit for himself in the loose sand, in  which it was easy for him to crouch perfectly concealed particularly as  there was no moon, and the light from the stars was not strong enough to  reveal objects at a distance much beyond a quarter of a mile.    The first, second, and third watches passed uneventfully; but the fourth  watch was little more than half through when--about a quarter after  three o'clock in the morning--the whole camp was roused from its  slumbers by the sound of musket-shots, one from the party guarding the  boats and the river approach, quickly followed by three in rapid  succession from the contingent that occupied the sand pits stretched  across the neck of the peninsula.  Then three or four more shots from  the river party spurted out, and it began to dawn upon us that the  matter threatened to be serious.  Of course none of us had thought of  discarding any of our clothing that night, the second shot therefore had  scarcely pealed out upon the night air before we in the camp were upon  our feet, with our weapons in our hands, and all drawn up in regular  array ready for the next move in the game, with the skipper in command.    \"Where are Mr Fortescue and Mr Copplestone?\" demanded the captain,  looking about him, as soon as the first momentary bustle was over.    \"Here I am, sir,\" answered I, stepping forward and mechanically touching  my hat; and \"Here I am, sir,\" answered Tom Copplestone, suddenly  appearing from nowhere in particular.    \"Mr Fortescue,\" ordered the captain, \"take to your heels and run out to  Mr Nugent as fast as you can; ascertain from him the reason for the  firing from his party; ask him whether he requires any assistance; and  then return to me with his reply as quickly as possible.  Mr  Copplestone, you will run down to the boats with a similar message to  Mr"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21077"],[0,"The Mind and the Brain (#12)"],[1,"understood, that in these definitions I am going against the ordinary  acceptation of the terms; I am taking the liberty of proposing new  meanings. This reality is, then, perceived in one case and conceived  in the other. Perceptibility or conceivability are, then, the two  forms which reality may assume. But _reality_ is not synonymous with  _truth_; notwithstanding the custom to the contrary, we may well  introduce a difference between these two terms. Reality is that which  is perceived or conceived; truth is that which accords with the whole  of our knowledge. Reality is a function of the senses or of ideation;  truth is a function of reasoning or of the reason.    For cognition to be complete, it requires the aid of all these  functions. And, in fact, what does conception by itself give? It  allows us to see if a thing is capable of representation. This is not  a common-place thing, I will observe in passing; for many things we  name are not capable of representation, and there is often a criticism  to be made; we think we are representing, and we are not. What is  capable of representation exists as a representation, but is it true?  Some philosophers have imagined so, but they are mistaken; what we  succeed in conceiving is alone possible.    Let us now take the Perceptible. Is what one perceives true? Yes, in  most cases it is so in fact; but an isolated perception may be false,  and disturbed by illusions of all kinds. It is all very well to say,  \"I see, I touch.\" There is no certainty through the senses alone in  many circumstances that the truth has been grasped. If I am shown the  spirit of a person I know to be dead, I shall not, notwithstanding the  testimony of my eyes, believe it to be true, for this apparition would  upset all my system of cognitions.    Truth is that which, being deemed conceivable, and being really  perceived, has also the quality of finding its place, its relation,  and its confirmation in the whole mass of cognitions previously  acquired.    These distinctions,[21] if developed, would readily demonstrate that  the advantages of observation are not eclipsed by those of  speculation; and that those of speculation, in their turn, do not  interfere with those of observation. But we have not time to develop  these rules of logic; it will be sufficient to point out their  relation to the question of the reality of mental images. Here are my  conclusions in two words. Physical phenomena and images are always  real, since they are perceived or conceived; what is sometimes wanting  to them, and makes them false, is that they do not accord with the  rest of our cognitions.[22]    Thus, then, are all objections overruled, in my opinion at least. We  can now consider the world of ideas as a physical world; but it is  one of a peculiar nature, which is not, like the other, accessible to  all, and is subject to its own laws, which are laws of association. By  these very different characteristics, it separates itself so sharply  from the outer world that all endeavour to bring the two together  seems shocking; and it is very easy to understand that many minds  should wish to remain faithful to the conception that ideas form a  mental or moral world. No metaphysical reasoning could prevail against  this sentiment, and we must give up the idea of destroying it. But we  think we have shown that idea, like sensation, comprises at the same  time the physical and the mental.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 19: Let me say, in passing, that this separation that  DESCARTES thinks he can establish between perception and ideation, is  only conceivable on condition that it be not too closely examined, and  that no exact definition of ideation be given. If we remark, in fact,  that all thought is a reproduction, in some degree, of a sensation, we  arrive at this conclusion: that a thought operated by a soul distinct  from the body would be a thought completely void and without object,  it would be the thought of nothingness. It is not, therefore,  conceivable. Consequently the criterion, already so dangerous, which  DESCARTES constantly employs--to wit: that what we clearly conceive is  true--cannot apply to thought, if we take the trouble to analyse it  and to replace a purely verbal conception by intuition.]    [Footnote 20: I somewhat regret that TAINE fell into the common-place  idea of the opposition of the brain and thought; he took up again this  old idea without endeavouring to analyse it, and only made it his own  by the ornamentation of his style. And as his was a mind of powerful  systematisation, the error which he committed led him into much wider  consequences than the error of a more common mind would have done.]    [Footnote 21: I have just come across them again in an ingenious note  of C. L. HERRICK: _The Logical and Psychological Distinction between  the True and the Real_ (_Psych. Rev._, May 1904). I entirely agree  with this author. But it is not he who exercised a suggestion over my  mind; it was M. BERGSON. See _Matiere et Memoire_, p. 159.]    [Footnote 22: In order to remain brief, I have not thought fit to  allude in the text to a question of metaphysics which closely depends  on the one broached by me: the existence of an outer world.  Philosophers who define sensation as a modality of our Ego are much  embarrassed later in demonstrating the existence of an outer world.  Having first admitted that our perception of it is illusory, since,  when we think we perceive this world, we have simply the feeling of  the modalities of our Ego, they find themselves powerless to  demonstrate that this illusion corresponds to a truth, and invoke in  despair, for the purpose of their demonstration, instinct,  hallucination, or some _a priori_ law of the mind. The position we  have taken in the discussion is far more simple. Since every sensation  is a fragment of matter perceived by a mind, the aggregate of  sensations constitutes the aggregate of matter. There is in this no  deceptive appearance, and consequently no need to prove a reality  distinct from appearances. As to the argument drawn from dreams and  hallucinations which might be brought against this, I have shown how  it is set aside by a distinction between perceptibility and truth. It  is no longer a matter of perception, but of reasoning. In other words,  all that we see, even in dreams, is real, but is not in its due  place.]          CHAPTER IV    DEFINITION OF THE EMOTIONS      After sensations and images, we have to name among the phenomena of  consciousness, the whole series of affective states--our pleasures and  our pains, our joys and our griefs, our sentiments, our emotions, and  our passions. It is universally admitted that these states are of a  mental nature, for several reasons. (1) We never objectivate them as  we do our sensations, but we constantly consider them as indwelling or  subjective states. This rule, however, allows an exception for the  pleasure and the pain termed physical, which are often localised in  particular parts of our bodies, although the position attributed to  them is less precise than with indifferent sensations. (2) We do not  alienate them as we do our indifferent sensations. The sensations of  weight, of colour, and of form serve us for the construction of bodies  which appear to us as perceived by us, but as being other than  ourselves. On the contrary, we constantly and without hesitation refer  our emotional states to our _Ego_. It is I who suffer, we say, I who  complain, I who hope. It is true that this attribution is not  absolutely characteristic of mental phenomena, for it happens that we  put a part of our Ego into material objects, such as our bodies, and  even into objects separate from our bodies, and whose sole relation to  us is that of a legal proprietorship. We must guard against the  somewhat frequent error of identifying the Ego with the psychical.    These two reasons sufficiently explain the tendency to see only  psychological states in the emotional ones; and, in fact, those  authors who have sought to oppose mind to matter have not failed to  introduce emotion into their parallel as representing the essence of  mind. On this point I will recall the fine ironical image used by  Tyndall, the illustrious English physicist, to show the abyss which  separates thought from the molecular states of the brain. \"Let us  suppose,\" he says, \"that the sentiment love, for example, corresponds  to a right-hand spiral movement of the molecules of the brain and the  sentiment hatred to a left-hand spiral movement. We should then know  that when we love, a movement is produced in one direction, and when  we hate, in another. But the Why would remain without an answer.\"    The question of knowing what place in our metaphysical theory we ought  to secure for emotion seems difficult to resolve, and we even find  some pleasure in leaving it in suspense, in order that it may be  understood that a metaphysician is not compelled to explain  everything. Besides, the difficulties which atop us here are  peculiarly of a psychological order. They proceed from the fact that  studies on the nature of the emotions are still very little advanced.  The physical conditions of these states are pretty well known, and  their psychical and social effects have been abundantly described; but  very little is known as to what distinguishes an emotion from a  thought.    Two principal opinions may be upheld in the actual state of our  acquaintance with the psychology of the feelings. When we endeavour to  penetrate their essential and final nature, we have a choice between  two contrary theories.    The first and traditional one consists in seeing in emotion a  phenomenon _sui generis_; this is very simple, and leaves nothing more  to be said.    The second bears the name of the intellectualist theory. It consists  in expunging the characteristic of the affective states. We consider  them as derivative "]]]
