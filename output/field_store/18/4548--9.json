But the one  example to which we would call the reader's attention, though among the  earlier productions of the period, as not only most readily accessible,  but most precious to the English student, is the celebrated Alcuin Bible  in the British Museum (Add. MS. 10546). This venerable MS. is a copy of  the Vulgate revised by Alcuin himself, and said to be exactly similar to  the one at Bamberg. Biblical revision was perhaps the most important of  his many literary occupations, and this volume is reasonably believed to  be the actual copy prepared for presentation to Charlemagne under the  reviser's own superintendence, possibly, in part at least, the work of  his own hand. It is a large folio, finely written in a neat minuscule,  mainly Saxon hand, with uncial initials in two columns. The miniatures,  including their architectural details, are in the Roman manner, the  ornaments partly Byzantine, partly Celtic. The great similarity of  design between different manuscripts is strikingly exemplified by a  comparison of three borders from (_a_) the Evangeliary of St. Vaast of  Arras, fol. 28 _v._ (see Delisle); (_b_) the Evangel. in National  Library, Paris, anc. fds. Lat. 257 (see Louandre), and Evangeliary No.  309 Bibl. de Cambrai (see Durieux).    [17] Plate in t. 1 of Louandre.    Indeed, comparisons of this kind are very instructive frequently as  suggestive of _provenance_, as each working centre would have its own  set of models and designs. Of course, comparison of the MSS. themselves  is out of the question, but the comparisons can often be effected by the  student's having Louandre, Durieux, Fleury, Labarte, etc., by his side  during the examination of any given period. The limits of our little  book forbid our speaking of other examples of this splendid style, but  we cannot conclude without noticing that in the opinion of M. Ferdinand  Denis, the Golden Gospels of St. Médard of Soissons is the most  beautiful Carolingian MSS. extant.

In the sixth century the monasteries, such as they were, necessarily  kept themselves very quiet and unobtrusive. They were situated usually  in out-of-the-way corners, solitudes apart from civilisation, or, at  least, apart from the busy haunts of men. In the eighth century there is  a marked difference. The Capitular of Aix-la-Chapelle, of 789, required  that minor schools should be attached _to all monasteries and cathedral  churches_ without exception, and that children of all ranks, _both noble  and servile_, should be received into them. Also that the larger  monasteries should open major schools in which the seven sciences of  mathematics, astronomy, arithmetic, music, rhetoric, dialectics, and  geography, were to be taught--and this in two ways. There were to be two  sorts of schools--interior or _claustral_, intended for monastics only,  and exterior or _canonical_, intended for secular students. These  schools were under separate scholastics or masters, and lay students  were received in the exterior schools as freely and fully as in the  public schools of the present time. Mabillon[18] gives a list of some  twenty-seven monastic and cathedral schools, by no means confined to  great or wealthy cities, but well distributed throughout the Empire.    [18] Præfat. in iv. Sæcul. 184.    In the time of Charlemagne those most in repute were Tours, St. Gall,  Fulda, Reims, and Hirsfeld.    We have given the names of Alcuin and Paul Warnefrid as the chief  promoters of the Carolingian Revival, but we should not omit that of  Theodulf, of Orleans, the indefatigable school inspector of the time. He  it was who assisted the artistic side of the movement by his ingenious  contrivances as a writer and illustrator of school books. Undoubtedly it  was from his suggestions that we so often find in mediæval scientific  treatises of the driest kind those graphic and wonderful tabulations and  edifices, labelled and turreted, which make Aristotle, Priscian, and  Marcianus Capella, not only comprehensible, but attractive. Theodulf  composed in simple and easy Latin verse--somewhat after the style of the  _Propria quæ maribus_ our own childhood--the description of a supposed  tree of science, which he had drawn and painted, on the trunk and  branches of which were the figures and names of the seven liberal arts.  At the foot sat Grammar--the basis of all learning--holding on her hand  a lengthy rod (ominous for the tender student). On the right Rhetoric  stretched forth her hand. On the left was Dialectic. Philosophy sat on  the summit; the rest being disposed according to their relative  importance. The whole was explained in the _Carmina de septem artibus_,  in which the bishop, who was one of the famous poets of the age, strove  in flowery language to render these dry-as-dust studies acceptable to  the youthful understanding. Theodulf was a great scholar, and assisted  Alcuin in the revision of the Bible, one copy of which he himself had  written whilst still Abbat of Fleury, about 790. At the beginning of  this Bible is a poem in golden letters on purple, and a preface in  prose, also in golden letters, giving a synopsis of the several books.  The text differs somewhat from the Alcuin Bible, as it is that of Jerome  before Alcuin's revision. This MS. is now at Paris. Another Bible  executed to the order of Theodulf is now in the Town Library at Puy.    It seems incredible, after the efforts made by Charlemagne and his  ministers for the maintenance of learning and the arts, that there  should ever be any risk of a return to barbarism, but it is a fact that  the dissolution of the Empire proved in certain localities the  suspension of prosperity. Fortunately the monastics--especially the  Benedictines--and the canons of the cathedrals still kept up the  practice of copying books; but almost all the South of France,  Languedoc, and Provence, always conservative, remained more or less  illiterate. They produced poets and jongleurs, but seldom artists or  scholars. And even in the North, where the capitular schools were most  flourishing--as Paris, Reims, and Chartres--the general tendency was  towards relapse. In High Germany it was even worse. In spite of all  efforts of the clergy by the extension of secular schools, the laity  preferred the excitement of chase and camp to the quiet humdrum of the  schoolroom. Religion seemed to be regarded rather as a profession than a  principle, quite right in its place, _i.e._ the Church and the  monastery, but unsuited for active life. The wealthy land-owners,  therefore, did not cease to endow religious houses or to build churches,  but they left book-learning to the clerics. Accordingly the clerics and  the monastics flourished exceedingly.    From the beginning of the tenth century to the beginning of the  thirteenth was the Golden Age of monasticism. The Order of St. Benedict  scattered its foundations thickly over France and Western Germany, while  its reformed colonies of Cluny, Citeaux, Clairvaux, and the Chartreuse  again spread their settlements in all directions. Thus we find Cluny  established in 910, Grammont in 1076, the Chartreuse in 1080, Citeaux in  1098, Savigny in 1105, Tiron in 1109, Austin Canons in 1038,  Premonstrants in 1120, Crutched Friars in 1169. In England, from 1100,  scarcely a year passed by without the establishment of some fresh  foundation. During the thirty-five years of the reign of Henry I. more  than 150 religious houses were founded. And even during the disastrous  reign of Stephen, in less than twenty years, no fewer than 100 houses of  various Orders were established. The twelfth century in England was  especially the age of monasteries.    It is true that not very much in the way of original literature, except  theological treatises, can be assigned to the three centuries referred  to, but the unwearied labours of the copyist and illuminator did much to  preserve the works which previous centuries had created. Of course, in  so long a period changes were many and great. So great, indeed, that  between a MS. of 850 and another of 1200 scarcely is there a common  feature.    From 850 to 1000 in France the Carolingian minuscule, from the first so  clear and beautiful, remained with scarce a stroke of alteration. But  immediately after the opening of the eleventh century a series of rapid  changes set in, and by the beginning of the twelfth a new hand,  perfectly clear and regular, but quite different from the Carolingian,  had been formed, which lasted until it was superseded by the Gothic,  while a system of contractions adopted because of the scarcity of  parchment creates a fresh need for study apart from the peculiarities of  personal habits. Side by side, too, with this there grows up a  non-professional hand--the so-called cursive or running hand of the  ordinary writer--in many cases, especially in deeds and other brief  compositions, all but utterly illegible, except to the professional  palæographer. Occasionally these autographs are of the highest  importance and intensely interesting, as, for instance, when in an  English MS. we come Across a note in the handwriting of Ordericus  (Vitalis) or Matthew Paris.    From 900 to 1200 the vast majority of MSS., illuminated and otherwise,  were the work of monastics. Every house of any note had its room set  apart for writing. The larger monasteries sometimes utilised the  cloisters of the churches themselves, in recesses of which they had  desks or tables placed for the copyist. Usually, however, they had a  large common room"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19880"],[0,"Voice Production in Singing and Speaking (#12)"],[1,"cords are brought about by muscles. But both for the  attachment of the muscles and the vocal cords themselves solid,  relatively hard structures are required. Bone would prove too  unyielding, but cartilage, or gristle, meets the case exactly. The  entire framework of the larynx--its skeleton, so to speak--is made up  of a series of cartilages united together so as to ensure sufficient  firmness with pliability.    The cartilages have been named from their shape, as that appealed to  the original observers, and the terms employed are of Greek origin.  The largest and strongest is the _thyroid_ (_thureos_, a shield)  cartilage, which resembles somewhat two shields put together in front  without any visible joint, and open behind but presenting a strongly  convex surface externally, in front and laterally. \"Front\" (anterior)  and \"back\" (posterior) always refer in anatomy to the subject  described, and not to the observer's position. In observing another's  larynx the subject observed and the observer naturally stand front to  front, and it is impossible to see or touch the back of the larynx as  it is covered behind by the other structures of the neck.    This thyroid, the largest of the cartilages, is attached to the hyoid  or tongue bone above by a membrane, so that the whole larynx hangs  suspended from this bone by a membrane, though not by it alone, for  muscles are attached to it which also serve for its support. It is of  practical importance to remember that the larynx is free to a very  considerable extent, otherwise it would go ill with the voice-producer  in the vigorous use of the voice, not to mention the advantages of  mobility as well as pliability in the movements of the neck  generally.    [Illustration: FIG. 20 (Spalteholz). Shows the thyroid cartilage above  and the cricoid below both viewed from the side. The anterior surface  is turned toward the right.]    [Illustration: FIG. 21 (Spalteholz). A front view of FIG. 20.]    [Illustration: FIG. 22 (Spalteholz). The back or signet surface of the  cricoid or ring cartilage, to which several muscles are attached.]    [Illustration: FIG. 23 (Spalteholz). The cricoid cartilage, seen from  the side, and showing behind and laterally the articular or joint  surfaces by which it connects with the thyroid below and the arytenoid  cartilage above.]    [Illustration: FIG. 24 (Spalteholz). Shows the arytenoid cartilages,  the most important of all the cartilages of the larynx, inasmuch as to  the part termed \"vocal process\" the vocal band is attached on each  side. The movements of the vocal bands are nearly all determined by  the movements of these cartilages, which have a swivel-like action. In  the above the front surfaces are turned toward each other.]    The _cricoid_ (_krikos_, a signet-ring) is the cartilage next in size.  It is situated below the thyroid cartilage, with which it is connected  by a membrane, the crico-thyroid. The wider part of this signet-ring  is situated behind, where it affords attachment to large muscles. It  also furnishes a base of support for two very important structures,  the _arytenoid_ (_arutaina_, a ladle) cartilages. As the vocal bands  are attached behind to them, and as they have a large degree of  mobility, they are from a physiological point of view the most  important of all the solid structures of the larynx.    There are two pairs of small bodies, the _cartilages of Santorini_, or  _cornicula laryngis_, surmounting the arytenoids, and the _cuneiform_,  or _cartilages of Wrisberg_, situated in the folds of mucous membrane  on each side of the arytenoids; but these structures are of little  importance.    The whole of the inner surface of the larynx is lined with mucous  membrane, though that covering over the true vocal bands is very thin,  and so does not cause them to appear red like the false vocal bands,  which are merely folds of the mucous membrane. However, the true vocal  bands may become red and thickened when inflamed, because of this same  mucous membrane, which, though ordinarily not visible to the eye,  becomes so when the condition referred to is present; for inflammation  is always attended by excess in the blood supply, with a prominence of  the small blood-vessels resulting in a corresponding redness. The  same thing happens, in fact, as in inflammation of the eyes or the  nose, both of which are more open to observation. Bearing this in mind  one can readily understand why in such a condition, which is often  approached if not actually present in the case of \"a cold,\" the voice  becomes so changed. Such vocal bands are clumsy in movement, as the  arms or any other part would be if thus swollen. The plain remedy is  rest, cessation of function--no speaking, much less attempts at  singing. Like the nose the larynx, and especially the vocal bands, may  be catarrhal, and such a condition may call for medical treatment  before the speaker or singer can do the most effective vocal work.    While the _false vocal bands_ have little or nothing to do with  phonation directly, they do serve a good purpose as protectors to the  more exalted true vocal bands. When coughing, swallowing, vomiting,  holding the breath tightly, etc., these folds of mucous membrane close  over the true bands, often completely, and thus shut up for the moment  the whole of that space between the bands known as the glottis, or  glottic chink, to which reference was made in a previous chapter as  the space through which the air finally gains access to the lungs.    The true vocal cords (which, because of having some breadth and being  rather flat, are better termed vocal bands) are composed largely of  _elastic tissue_. The reader may be familiar with this structure,  which is often to be found in the portions of the neck of the ox that  the butcher sells as soup beef. It is yellow in color, and stretching  it has furnished many a boy with amusement. It is so unmanageable when  raw that when it falls to the dog he usually bolts it, the case being  otherwise hopeless. Such elastic tissue is, however, the very material  for the construction of vocal bands, as they require to be firm yet  elastic.    [Illustration: FIG. 25 (Spalteholz). A view of the larynx from behind.  Several of the muscles are well shown, of which the two indicated  above are of the most importance. The arytenoideus proprius tends to  bring the cartilages from which it is named, and therefore the vocal  bands, toward each other; while the posterior crico-thyroid, from its  attachments and line of pull, tends to separate these and lengthen the  vocal bands.]    [Illustration: FIG. 26 (Spalteholz). Showing structures as indicated  above. The mucous membrane, that naturally covers all parts within the  vocal mechanism, has been dissected away to show the muscles.]    [Illustration: FIG. 27 (Spalteholz). Showing the parts indicated  above; and of these the crico-thyroid muscle is to be especially  observed. The oblique (especially so in the posterior part) direction  of its fibres is evident, so that when it contracts, it must pull up  the ring cartilage in front, and so tilt back its hinder portion and  with it the arytenoid cartilages, and so lengthen and tense the vocal  bands, as in the utterance of low tones.]    [Illustration: FIG. 28 (Spalteholz). A back (posterior) view of the  larynx, etc. Note how the arytenoid cartilages rest on the cricoid;  how the epiglottis overhangs, as its name implies, the glottis; and  that the posterior part of the windpipe is closed in by soft  structures, including (unstriped) muscle.]    It is important to remember the relative position of parts and to bear  in mind that most of the laryngeal structures are in pairs. To this  last statement the thyroid and cricoid cartilages and the epiglottis  are exceptions, being single.    Of the _epiglottis_, a flexible cartilage, it is necessary to say  little, as its function in voice-production, if it have any, has never  been determined. It hangs as a flexible protective lid over the  glottis, and food in being swallowed passes over and about it. It no  doubt acts to keep food and drink out of the larynx, yet in its  absence, in some cases, owing to disease, no very great difficulty was  experienced, probably because certain muscles acted more vigorously  than usual and tended to close up the glottic chink.    The following simple diagram will, it is hoped, make the relative  position of parts plain so far as the anterior (front) attachments of  parts to the thyroid cartilage are concerned. It will be understood  that the inner anterior surface is meant, and that by \"middle line\"  is intended the middle line of the body, the imaginary vertical  diameter passing like a plumb-line from the middle plane of the head,  let us suppose, downward just in front of the larynx.    [Illustration: FIG. 29.]    The angle made above and in front where the two wings of the thyroid  cartilage meet is termed _Adam's apple_ (_Pomum Adami_), and in some  cases, mostly males, is very prominent. Adam's apple has in itself,  however, no special significance in voice-production.    The little concavity between the false vocal bands above and the true  vocal bands below is termed the _ventricle of the larynx_. It allows  of more space for the free movements of the bands, especially those  more important in voice-production.    The vocal bands are attached behind to the projecting angle of the  base of the arytenoid cartilage, which is itself somewhat triangular  in shape, the base of the triangle being downward and resting on the  upper and posterior (back) surface of the cricoid cartilage, with  which it makes a free joint, so that it can move swivel-like in all  directions. This is most important, because through it is explained  the fact that the vocal bands may be either tensed and lengthened or  relaxed and shortened.    _The muscles act on these movable cartilages, and nearly all the  changes in"]]]
