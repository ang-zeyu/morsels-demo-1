He has also done the same thing in America--limited the number of Summer  Schools--as the friends in their enthusiasm to inaugurate new institutions  wanted to have very many summer schools which would have not only  weakened, instead of strengthening, the older schools, but also would have  dissipated the energy of the friends.    Assuring you and all the members of your Assembly of his loving prayers on  your behalf and for the success of your work,  Yours in His Service,  R. Rabbani.            LETTER OF MARCH 13TH, 1945      Haifa, March 13th, 1945.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    Your letter of Feb. 9th has been received (written on behalf of the  N.S.A.), and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his  behalf and to also acknowledge receipt of the copy of the resolutions  which you forwarded in it.    The news you conveyed was all very encouraging and pleased him greatly.    He was particularly happy to hear of the formation of a new Spiritual  Assembly at Caringbah as this marks an important step forward in the  growth of the Cause and its administrative institutions in Australia. He  hopes that the N.S.A. will, through travelling and visiting teachers, and  Baha'i settlers and pioneers, be able to speedily ensure the establishment  of further assemblies; wherever the conditions for their development seem  most promising, the efforts should be concentrated.    He was also very glad to hear that the Haziratu'l-Quds has been  successfully transferred to the name of the National Assembly. He is  looking forward to receiving the photographs of its opening, and of the  Centenary dinner, which you are sending him. Likewise he was pleased to  see it is being put to such active use and teaching classes, public  meetings, etc. being held in it.    He cannot stress too much the vital importance of the teaching work, and  he hopes that all the believers, however circumscribed their means,  however unqualified they may feel themselves to be, will arise and  contribute their share to this all-important work. The Cause has, all  things considered, made remarkable progress in Australia and New Zealand  of late; but the united efforts of all the friends are required to spread  the Divine Message during these moving and dark times the world is passing  through. They must fix their eyes on the abject misery of humanity and,  forgetful of their own limitations, deliver the Teachings to their fellow  countrymen.    He assures you and your co-workers that he deeply appreciates your devoted  services, and will constantly pray for the progress of the Faith in those  distant and important lands.    With Baha'i love,  R. Rabbani.    P.S. He hopes that the N.S.A. watches over dear Mother Dunn. She is now  advancing in years and deserves the greatest love and consideration in  view of the imperishable services she and Father Dunn rendered the Cause  there.    P.P.S. Your previous letter, dated Aug. 18th as well as the photostat  copies connected with the incorporation of the N.S.A. reached him. He was  delighted at this further evidence of the efficiency of that body and the  manner in which it is consolidating its foundation.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The teaching responsibilities confronting the Australian and New Zealand  believers are of supreme importance and of extreme urgency. Now that the  basis of the Administrative Order has been firmly laid, and fully  understood, and the national Haziratu'l-Quds established in the leading  city of the Australian Commonwealth, the attention of the members of the  entire community must be focussed on the teaching work--the promotion of  which is the ultimate object of the entire machinery of the Administrative  Order and its subsidiary institutions and agencies. The multiplication of  Baha'i groups, the steady increase in the number of local assemblies, the  dissemination of literature, the dispersal of the believers, no matter how  small their number, to important centers throughout the continent  constitute the vital task of the infant community which has, despite its  limited resources and isolated situation, demonstrated its capacity to  establish on a sound basis the primary institutions of its Faith, to  safeguard its unity and promote its vital interests. That it may forge  ahead and overcome every obstacle in its path and fulfil its high destiny  is my fondest hope and constant prayer.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF MAY 13TH, 1945      Haifa, May 13th, 1945.    Dear Baha'i Sister:    The beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters dated April  12th, 13th (two) and 14th, and to acknowledge receipt of the enclosures  forwarded with them.    Regarding the matter of Mrs. ... and the inharmony that seems to exist  among certain of the friends in ...: when Baha'is permit the dark forces  of the world to enter into their own relationships within the Faith they  gravely jeopardise its progress; it is the paramount duty of the  believers, the local assemblies, and particularly the N.S.A. to foster  harmony, understanding and love amongst the friends. All should be ready  and willing to set aside every personal sense of grievance--justified or  unjustified--for the good of the Cause, because the people will never  embrace it until they see in its community life mirrored what is so  conspicuously lacking in the world: love and unity.    The Baha'is are fully entitled to address criticisms to their assemblies;  they can freely air their views about policies or individual members of  elected bodies to the assembly, local or national, but then they must  whole-heartedly accept the advice or decision of the assembly, according  to the principles already laid down for such matters in Baha'i  administration.    Shoghi Effendi has repeatedly stated, to believers in every part of the  world, that the individual Baha'is are entirely free to write to him on  any matter they please; naturally he is equally free to answer in any  manner he pleases. At the present time, when the institutions of the Cause  are just beginning to function, he considers it essential to keep up this  large correspondence, much as it adds to his many other burdens. It is  sometimes the case that the very first intimation he receives of some  important step influencing the interests of the Faith, one way or another,  comes from an individual's letter instead of from an assembly; it would  naturally be preferable for the information to come from an administrative  body, but whatever the source, the Guardian is solely concerned with the  welfare of the Faith, and when he deems a certain step detrimental he  states his views in his reply. This he is at entire liberty to do.    Just as the National Assembly has full jurisdiction over all its local  Assemblies, the Guardian has full jurisdiction over all National  Assemblies; he is not required to consult them, if he believes a certain  decision is advisable in the interests of the Cause. He is the judge of  the wisdom and advisability of the decisions made by these bodies, and not  they of the wisdom and advisability of his decisions. A perusal of the  Will and Testament makes this principle quite clear.    He is the Guardian of the Cause in the very fullness of that term, and the  appointed interpreter of its teachings, and is guided in his decisions to  do that which protects it and fosters its growth and highest interests.    He always has the right to step in and countermand the decisions of a  national assembly; if he did not possess this right he would be absolutely  impotent to protect the Faith, just as the N.S.A., if it were divested of  the right to countermand the decisions of a local assembly, would be  incapable of watching over and guiding the national welfare of the Baha'i  Community.    It very seldom happens--but it nevertheless does happen--that he feels  impelled to change a major (as you put it) decision of an N.S.A.; but he  always unhesitatingly does so when necessary, and the N.S.A. in question  should gladly and unhesitatingly accept this as a measure designed for the  good of the Faith which its elected representatives are so devotedly  seeking to serve.    Regarding the position of Summer Schools in Australia: much of what you  are at present going through has already been experienced by the American  Baha'i Community, and he sympathises with your views and problems; however  he wishes to state the following:    Whatever the history of the Yerrinbool School may be, the fact remains it  is now in existence, is owned by believers ready to have it used as such,  and is known as a Baha'i Summer School all over the world. The Guardian is  not the least concerned with personalities in this matter, but with  principles. He feels at the present time that one Baha'i Summer School is  enough for the believers of Australia to maintain. In the future, as  assemblies and groups multiply, the question will naturally have to be  reconsidered.    Baha'i Summer Schools in the United States originated in the same informal  manner as Yerrinbool; they were (and some still are) the property of  individual believers who resided on them, but they are administered by  Committees appointed by the N.S.A. and which usually include, out of  courtesy and consideration, the owners. The American friends also desired  to have many more Summer Schools, but the Guardian has so far not  permitted them to add to the number, as it dissipates the energy and funds  of the believers and would at present weaken those already existing.    He feels that the duty of your Assembly is to not give up Yerrinbool  because of any inharmony over it, but to administer and support it  properly and remove the inharmony. You should appoint a Committee for the  School, purchase any extra equipment needed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19275"],[0,"God Passes By (#12)"],[1,"disciples, who were already  incensed by the cruel captivity of their Leader, and whose ardor was now  further inflamed by the outpourings of His pen which reached them  unceasingly from the place of His confinement. It provoked a heated and  prolonged controversy throughout the length and breadth of the land, in  bazaars, masjids, madrisihs and other public places, deepening thereby the  cleavage that had already sundered its people. Muhammad _Sh_ah, at so  perilous an hour, was meanwhile rapidly sinking under the weight of his  physical infirmities. The shallow-minded Haji Mirza Aqasi, now the pivot  of state affairs, exhibited a vacillation and incompetence that seemed to  increase with every extension in the range of his grave responsibilities.  At one time he would feel inclined to support the verdict of the 'ulamas;  at another he would censure their aggressiveness and distrust their  assertions; at yet another, he would relapse into mysticism, and, wrapt in  his reveries, lose sight of the gravity of the emergency that confronted  him.    So glaring a mismanagement of national affairs emboldened the clerical  order, whose members were now hurling with malignant zeal anathemas from  their pulpits, and were vociferously inciting superstitious congregations  to take up arms against the upholders of a much hated creed, to insult the  honor of their women folk, to plunder their property and harass and injure  their children. \"What of the signs and prodigies,\" they thundered before  countless assemblies, \"that must needs usher in the advent of the Qa'im?  What of the Major and Minor Occultations? What of the cities of Jabulqa  and Jabulsa? How are we to explain the sayings of Husayn-ibn-Ruh, and what  interpretation should be given to the authenticated traditions ascribed to  Ibn-i-Mihriyar? Where are the Men of the Unseen, who are to traverse, in a  week, the whole surface of the earth? What of the conquest of the East and  West which the Qa'im is to effect on His appearance? Where is the one-eyed  Anti-Christ and the ass on which he is to mount? What of Sufyan and his  dominion?\" \"Are we,\" they noisily remonstrated, \"are we to account as a  dead letter the indubitable, the unnumbered traditions of our holy Imams,  or are we to extinguish with fire and sword this brazen heresy that has  dared to lift its head in our land?\"    To these defamations, threats and protestations the learned and resolute  champions of a misrepresented Faith, following the example of their  Leader, opposed unhesitatingly treatises, commentaries and refutations,  assiduously written, cogent in their argument, replete with testimonies,  lucid, eloquent and convincing, affirming their belief in the Prophethood  of Muhammad, in the legitimacy of the Imams, in the spiritual sovereignty  of the Sahibu'z-Zaman (the Lord of the Age), interpreting in a masterly  fashion the obscure, the designedly allegorical and abstruse traditions,  verses and prophecies in the Islamic holy Writ, and adducing, in support  of their contention, the meekness and apparent helplessness of the Imam  Husayn who, despite his defeat, his discomfiture and ignominious  martyrdom, had been hailed by their antagonists as the very embodiment and  the matchless symbol of God's all-conquering sovereignty and power.    This fierce, nation-wide controversy had assumed alarming proportions when  Muhammad _Sh_ah finally succumbed to his illness, precipitating by his  death the downfall of his favorite and all-powerful minister, Haji Mirza  Aqasi, who, soon stripped of the treasures he had amassed, fell into  disgrace, was expelled from the capital, and sought refuge in Karbila. The  seventeen year old Nasiri'd-Din Mirza ascended the throne, leaving the  direction of affairs to the obdurate, the iron-hearted Amir-Nizam, Mirza  Taqi _Kh_an, who, without consulting his fellow-ministers, decreed that  immediate and condign punishment be inflicted on the hapless Babis.  Governors, magistrates and civil servants, throughout the provinces,  instigated by the monstrous campaign of vilification conducted by the  clergy, and prompted by their lust for pecuniary rewards, vied in their  respective spheres with each other in hounding and heaping indignities on  the adherents of an outlawed Faith. For the first time in the Faith's  history a systematic campaign in which the civil and ecclesiastical powers  were banded together was being launched against it, a campaign that was to  culminate in the horrors experienced by Baha'u'llah in the Siyah-_Ch_al of  Tihran and His subsequent banishment to 'Iraq. Government, clergy and  people arose, as one man, to assault and exterminate their common enemy.  In remote and isolated centers the scattered disciples of a persecuted  community were pitilessly struck down by the sword of their foes, while in  centers where large numbers had congregated measures were taken in  self-defense, which, misconstrued by a cunning and deceitful adversary,  served in their turn to inflame still further the hostility of the  authorities, and multiply the outrages perpetrated by the oppressor. In  the East at _Sh_ay_kh_ Tabarsi, in the south in Nayriz, in the west in  Zanjan, and in the capital itself, massacres, upheavals, demonstrations,  engagements, sieges, acts of treachery proclaimed, in rapid succession,  the violence of the storm which had broken out, and exposed the  bankruptcy, and blackened the annals, of a proud yet degenerate people.    The audacity of Mulla Husayn who, at the command of the Bab, had attired  his head with the green turban worn and sent to him by his Master, who had  hoisted the Black Standard, the unfurling of which would, according to the  Prophet Muhammad, herald the advent of the vicegerent of God on earth, and  who, mounted on his steed, was marching at the head of two hundred and two  of his fellow-disciples to meet and lend his assistance to Quddus in the  Jaziriy-i-_Kh_adra (Verdant Isle)--his audacity was the signal for a clash  the reverberations of which were to resound throughout the entire country.  The contest lasted no less than eleven months. Its theatre was for the  most part the forest of Mazindaran. Its heroes were the flower of the  Bab's disciples. Its martyrs comprised no less than half of the Letters of  the Living, not excluding Quddus and Mulla Husayn, respectively the last  and the first of these Letters. The directive force which however  unobtrusively sustained it was none other than that which flowed from the  mind of Baha'u'llah. It was caused by the unconcealed determination of the  dawn-breakers of a new Age to proclaim, fearlessly and befittingly, its  advent, and by a no less unyielding resolve, should persuasion prove a  failure, to resist and defend themselves against the onslaughts of  malicious and unreasoning assailants. It demonstrated beyond the shadow of  a doubt what the indomitable spirit of a band of three hundred and  thirteen untrained, unequipped yet God-intoxicated students, mostly  sedentary recluses of the college and cloister, could achieve when pitted  in self-defense against a trained army, well equipped, supported by the  masses of the people, blessed by the clergy, headed by a prince of the  royal blood, backed by the resources of the state, acting with the  enthusiastic approval of its sovereign, and animated by the unfailing  counsels of a resolute and all-powerful minister. Its outcome was a  heinous betrayal ending in an orgy of slaughter, staining with everlasting  infamy its perpetrators, investing its victims with a halo of imperishable  glory, and generating the very seeds which, in a later age, were to  blossom into world-wide administrative institutions, and which must, in  the fullness of time, yield their golden fruit in the shape of a  world-redeeming, earth-encircling Order.    It will be unnecessary to attempt even an abbreviated narrative of this  tragic episode, however grave its import, however much misconstrued by  adverse chroniclers and historians. A glance over its salient features  will suffice for the purpose of these pages. We note, as we conjure up the  events of this great tragedy, the fortitude, the intrepidity, the  discipline and the resourcefulness of its heroes, contrasting sharply with  the turpitude, the cowardice, the disorderliness and the inconstancy of  their opponents. We observe the sublime patience, the noble restraint  exercised by one of its principal actors, the lion-hearted Mulla Husayn,  who persistently refused to unsheathe his sword until an armed and angry  multitude, uttering the foulest invectives, had gathered at a farsang's  distance from Barfuru_sh_ to block his way, and had mortally struck down  seven of his innocent and staunch companions. We are filled with  admiration for the tenacity of faith of that same Mulla Husayn,  demonstrated by his resolve to persevere in sounding the a_dh_an, while  besieged in the caravanserai of Sabsih-Maydan, though three of his  companions, who had successively ascended to the roof of the inn, with the  express purpose of performing that sacred rite, had been instantly killed  by the bullets of the enemy. We marvel at the spirit of renunciation that  prompted those sore pressed sufferers to contemptuously ignore the  possessions left behind by their fleeing enemy; that led them to discard  their own belongings, and content themselves with their steeds and swords;  that induced the father of Badi, one of that gallant company, to fling  unhesitatingly by the roadside the satchel, full of turquoises which he  had brought from his father's mine in Ni_sh_apur; that led Mirza  Muhammad-Taqiy-i-Juvayni to cast away a sum equivalent in value in silver  and gold; and impelled those same companions to disdain, and refuse even  to touch, the costly furnishings and the coffers of gold and silver which  the demoralized and shame-laden Prince Mihdi-Quli Mirza, the commander of  the army of Mazindaran and "]]]
