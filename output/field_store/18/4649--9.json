In 1158 Henry, celebrating the Christmas festival  at Worcester, took the crown from his head and placed it upon the  altar, after which he never wore it. But he did not cease to keep  Christmas. In 1171 he went to Ireland, where the chiefs of the land  displayed a wonderful alacrity in taking the oath of allegiance, and  were rewarded by being entertained in a style that astonished them.  Finding no place in Dublin large enough to contain his own followers,  much less his guests, Henry had a house built in Irish fashion of  twigs and wattles in the village of Hogges, and there held high  revelry during Christmastide, teaching his new subjects to eat cranes'  flesh, and take their part in miracle plays, masques, mummeries, and  tournaments. And a great number of oxen were roasted, so that all the  people might take part in the rejoicings.      CHRISTMAS ENTERTAINMENTS AT CONSTANTINOPLE.    In his description of Christian Constantinople, Benjamin of Tudela, a  Spanish Jew, who travelled through the East in the twelfth century  (1159 or 1160), describes a \"place where the king diverts himself,  called the hippodrome, near to the wall of the palace. There it is  that every year, on the day of the birth of Jesus the Nazarene, the  king gives a grand entertainment. There are represented by magic arts  before the king and queen, figures of all kinds of men that exist in  the world; thither also are taken lions, bears, tigers, and wild  asses, which are made to fight together; as well as birds. There is no  such sight to be seen in all the world.\" At Constantinople, on the  marriage of the Emperor Manuel with Mary, daughter of the Prince of  Antioch, on Christmas Day, 1161, there were great rejoicings, and  similar spectacular entertainments to those described by Benjamin of  Tudela.      AN ARCHBISHOP MURDERED AT CHRISTMASTIDE.    During the Christmas festival of 1170 (December 29th) occurred an  event memorable in ecclesiastical history--the murder of Thomas  Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1162 Becket (who had previously  been Chancellor to Henry II.) was made Archbishop, in succession to  Archbishop Theobald. The King soon found that he who had served him  faithfully as Chancellor would oppose him doggedly as Archbishop.  Henry determined to subject the Church as well as the State to the  supremacy of the law; and Becket determined to resist the King to the  end, thus manifesting his desire for martyrdom in the cause of the  Church. Henry had greatly offended the Archbishop by causing his  eldest son to be crowned by the Archbishop of York. For this violation  of the rights of Canterbury Becket threatened to lay the country under  an interdict, which he had the power from the Pope to pronounce. A  sort of reconciliation was effected between the King and the  Archbishop at Freteval on July 21, 1170, but a further dispute arose  on Becket delaying his return to England, the King being anxious to  get him out of France. The Archbishop was full of complaints against  Henry for the injuries he had done to his see, and the King stood upon  his dignity, regardless of the threatened interdiction. The Archbishop  returned to England on the 1st of December, and was joyfully received  by the people. His enemies, however, and especially the family of De  Broc, did all they could to annoy him; and on Christmas Day he uttered  a violent anathema against them. He preached from the text, \"I come to  die among you,\" evidently anticipating what might be the personal  consequences of his action. He told his congregation that one of the  archbishops had been a martyr, and they would probably soon see  another; but before he departed home he would avenge some of the  wrongs the Church had suffered during the previous seven years. Then  he thundered forth his sentence of excommunication against Ranulph and  Robert de Broc, and Nigellus, rector of Harrow. Meanwhile news had  reached the King that Becket had excommunicated certain bishops who  had taken part in his son's coronation. In a fit of exasperation the  King uttered some hasty words of anger against the Archbishop. Acting  upon these, four of Henry's knights--Hugh de Morville, Reginald  FitzUrse, William de Tracy, and Richard Brito--crossed to England,  taking with them Ranulf de Broc and a band of men, and murdered the  Archbishop in Canterbury Cathedral. In the altercation which took  place before the consummation of the terrible deed, the Primate was  asked to absolve the bishops whom he had excommunicated, but he  refused in a defiant and insulting manner. \"Then die,\" exclaimed  FitzUrse, striking at Becket's head with his weapon; but the devoted  cross-bearer warded off the blow with his own arm, which was badly  cut, so that the Archbishop was but slightly injured. One of the  attacking party then called out, \"Fly, or thou diest!\" The Archbishop,  however, clasped his hands, and, with the blood streaming down his  face, fervently exclaimed, \"To God, to St. Mary, to the holy patrons  of this Church, and to St. Denis I commend my soul and the Church's  cause.\" He was then struck down by a second blow, and the third  completed the tragedy; whereupon one of the murderers, putting his  foot on the dead prelate's neck, cried, \"Thus dies a traitor!\" In 1173  the Archbishop was canonised, and his festival was appointed for the  day of his martyrdom; and for three centuries after his death the  shrine of St. Thomas at Canterbury was a favourite place of  pilgrimage, so great was the impression that his martyrdom made on the  minds of the English people. As early as the Easter of 1171 Becket's  sepulchre was the scene of many miracles, if Matthew Paris, the  historian, is to be believed. What must have been the credulity of the  people in an age when an historian could gravely write, as Matthew  Paris did in 1171? \"In this year, about Easter, it pleased the Lord  Jesus Christ to irradiate his glorious martyr Thomas Becket with many  miracles, that it might appear to all the world he had obtained a  victory suitable to his merits. None who approached his sepulchre in  faith returned without a cure. For strength was restored to the lame,  hearing to the deaf, sight to the blind, speech to the dumb, health to  the lepers, and life to the dead. Nay, not only men and women, but  even birds and beasts were raised from death to life.\"      ROYAL CHRISTMASES AT WINDSOR.    Windsor Castle appears to have been the favourite residence of Henry  II. When, in 1175, he had united with him his son Henry in his crown  and prerogatives, the two kings held an assembly at Windsor, attended  by the judges, deputies of counties and districts, and all the great  officers of state. Henry also kept his ensuing Christmas with the  magnificence and display peculiar to the times, and all the ancient  sports and usages; in which the nobles and gentry of the surrounding  country assisted with much splendour at the hunt and tourney, and  bestowed lavish gifts on the spectators and the people. After the  kingdom was parcelled out into four jurisdictions, another assembly  was held at the castle, in 1179, by the two kings; and, in 1184, Henry  for the last time celebrated his Christmas in the same hall of state:  his son, who had shared the throne with him, being then dead.    For the festivals of this period the tables of princes, prelates, and  great barons were plentifully supplied with many dishes of meat  dressed in various ways. The Normans sent agents into different  countries to collect the most rare dishes for their tables, by which  means, says John of Salisbury, this island, which is naturally  productive of plenty and variety of provisions, was overflowed with  everything that could inflame a luxurious appetite. The same writer  says he was present at an entertainment which lasted from three  o'clock in the afternoon to midnight; at which delicacies were served  up which had been brought from Constantinople, Babylon, Alexandria,  Palestine, Tripoli, Syria, and Phoenicia. The sumptuous  entertainments which the kings of England gave to their nobles and  prelates at the festivals of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide  diffused a taste for profuse and expensive banqueting; for the wealthy  barons, prelates, and gentry, in their own castles and mansions,  imitated the splendour of the royal entertainments. Great men had some  kinds of provisions at their tables which are not now to be found in  Britain. When Henry II. entertained his own court, the great officers  of his army, and all the kings and great men in Ireland, at the feast  of Christmas, 1171, the Irish princes and chieftains were quite  astonished at the profusion and variety of provisions which they  beheld, and were with difficulty prevailed on by Henry to eat the  flesh of cranes, a kind of food to which they had not been accustomed.  Dellegrout, maupigyrum, karumpie, and other dishes were then used, the  composition of which is now unknown, or doubtful. Persons of rank and  wealth had variety of drinks, as well as meats; for, besides wines of  various kinds, they had pigment, morat, mead, hypocras, claret, cider,  perry, and ale. The claret of those times was wine clarified and mixed  with spices, and hypocras was wine mixed with honey.    [Illustration: A COOK OF THE PERIOD.]    The profusion of viands and drinks, obtained at great expense from  different parts of the world for the gratification of the animal  appetites at such festivals as have been described, naturally led to      EXCESSES IN EATING AND DRINKING,    and from the statements and illustrations in old manuscripts it would  appear that \"the merry monks\" were prominent in gastronomical circles.  And extant records also state that the abbots of some of the  monasteries found it necessary to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22065"],[0,"An Elementary Spanish Reader (#12)"],[1,"iable= insatiable, never satisfied    =insistió= _3 sing. pret. ind. of_ =insistir=    =insistir= to insist    =instante=, _m._ instant, moment;
