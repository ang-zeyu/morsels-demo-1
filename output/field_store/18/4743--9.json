[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24416"],[0,"Life and Work in Benares and Kumaon, 1839-1877 (#12)"],[1," Benares is to  the Hindus. They form by far the largest portion of the population of  India, and to them Benares--or as they delight to call it, Kasee the  Splendid, the Glorious City--is the most sacred spot on earth. They say,  indeed, it is not built on the earth, but on a point of Shiva's trident.  They assert that at one time it was of gold, but in this degenerate age  it has been turned into stone and clay. In their belief the Ganges is  sacred through its entire course, but as it flows past the sacred city  its cleansing efficacy is supposed to be vastly increased. The rites  performed at Kasee have double merit, and its very soil and air are so  fraught with blessing that all who die there go to heaven, whatever  their character may be. With this belief diffused among the millions  who, differing widely from each other in nationality and language, are  devoted to Hinduism, it may be supposed how many eyes are reverently  turned towards Kasee, and with what eager steps and high expectations  vast numbers resort to it. I have frequently seen persons entering the  city, not on foot--that they did not deem sufficiently respectful--but  prostrating themselves on the ground, measuring the ground with their  bodies, and approaching the sacred shrines. And then, especially on the  occasion of great festivals, bands may be seen entering the city, often  composed of women--hand-in-hand lest they should lose each other in the  crowd--singing the praises of Shiva and the glories of his city. Many  aged people come from distant parts of India--the greater number, I  believe, from Bengal--to reside and end their days in it, that by  becoming Kasseebas (dwellers in Kasee) they may when they die become  Baikuntbas (dwellers in heaven).    Though Benares be _par excellence_ the sacred city of the Hindus,  strange to say they are proportionately fewer than in ten cities of the  North-West. According to the census of 1872, there were 133,549 Hindus  and 44,374 Mussulmans: that is, a little more than three Hindus to one  Mussulman. In the great commercial city of Mirzapore, about thirty miles  distant from Benares, there were five Hindus to one Mussulman. The fact  thus certified is entirely at variance with the conjecture made by those  who look at the crowds bathing at the riverside, and frequenting the  temples, and contrast them with the small number seen in the mosques,  even on Friday, the Muhammadan weekly day of worship. In the district  the Hindus vastly out-number the Muhammadans.    Benares is built on the left bank of the Ganges, and extends in a  crescent shape three miles and a half along the bank, and a little more  than a mile inward. The most imposing view is from a boat slowly  dropping down the stream in the early morning--the earlier the better,  especially if it be the hot season, as then the people betake themselves  to the river in greater numbers than at any other time. Travellers in  many lands who have seen this view, have declared it to be one of the  most remarkable sights of the kind which the world presents.    Photographic and pencil pictures of Benares have appeared in illustrated  newspapers, in periodicals and books, and give a more vivid and correct  impression than can be conveyed by a verbal description. These pictures  can, however, be better understood when those who look at them are  furnished with information which no picture can afford.    The right bank of the Ganges at Benares is very low, and is always  flooded when the river rises; but the left bank, on which the city  stands, is in many parts more than a hundred feet high. The river sweeps  round this high bank. The city is connected with the river by flights of  stone steps, called \"ghats.\" This word ghat often meets the reader of  books on India. It has various meanings. It means a mountain-pass, a  ferry, a place on the riverside where people meet, and, as is the case  at Benares, the steps which lead down to the river. Two small streams  enter the Ganges at Benares--on the southern side the Assi, on the  northern side the Burna. Some have supposed that the city has received  its name from lying between these two rivulets--Burna, Assi, making the  word Burunassi, Benares; but this derivation is more than doubtful.  Others maintain the word comes from a famous rajah called Bunar; but  this, too, is a mere conjecture.    [Sidenote: A TRIP ON THE RIVER.]    Let me take my readers with me on a trip down the river. We embark at  early dawn on a native boat at Assi Sungam, which means the confluence  of the Assi with the Ganges, at the southern extremity. Towards that end  of the city some of the houses seen on the high bank are poor, some are  falling into decay; but as you advance, lofty buildings, some of them of  a size and grandeur which entitle them to the name of palaces, come into  view. Their numerous small windows, their rich and varied carving, their  balconies and flat roofs, give them a very Eastern look. Perhaps the  most notable of the buildings are an observatory, built by a famous  Rajput prince, Jae Singh, and a massy and extensive structure, with its  buttresses and high walls looking as if recently erected, which was  built in the last half of the eighteenth century by Cheit-Singh, the  Rajah of Benares at that time, who was deposed by Warren Hastings on  account of his refusal to comply with the demands of the British  Government. In Macaulay's famous Essay on Warren Hastings there is a  long narrative of this contest, which is amusingly at variance with the  narrative given by Warren Hastings himself. This building is still  called Cheit-Singh's Palace, but since his day it has been the property  of the British Government, and has been for many years the residence of  princes of the old imperial family of Delhi, who on account of family  troubles had come to reside in Benares, and were, happily for  themselves, far from Delhi during the mutiny of 1857. Some of the  mansions facing the river belong to Indian princes, who occupy them on  the rare occasion of visits to the city, and leave them in charge of  servants, of whom a number are Brahmans performing sacred rites on  their behalf.    There is one spot on the riverside from which most visitors avert their  eyes with horror--the place where the dead of Benares and the  surrounding country are being burnt, and the ashes thrown into the  stream. The fire at that place never goes out. Cremation, not burial, it  is well known, is the Indian mode of disposing of the dead.    The peculiarity of Benares as the sacred city of the country is  strikingly attested by the temples, which crowd the high bank of the  river, and arrest the special attention of the visitor. Some of these  are much larger and more expensive than others, but there is little  variety in their form; and all of them, even the largest and most  frequented, are small compared with Christian and Muhammadan places of  worship. They are circular, with heavy domes narrowing towards the top,  and, as a rule, with a narrow doorway alone admitting light and air.  Some domes are of respectable height, but none approach that of many of  our church towers and steeples. Most of the temples are sacred to Shiva,  Mahadeo, the Great God, as his devotees delight to call him, and are  surmounted by his trident. Many have a pole at their side with a flag  attached to it. One sees at a glance they must, though small, have cost  large sums, as they are most solidly built of hewn stone, and have all  more or less of ornamentation. A few temples are built close to the  water's edge. One has got off its equilibrium, and looks as if it were  about to fall into the stream; but for many years it has remained in  this tottering position.    [Sidenote: BATHING IN THE SACRED STREAM.]    While the houses and temples on the riverside are viewed with interest,  the visitor, as he looks from his boat, is still more interested in the  living mass before him. It is the early morning. The sun has just risen  above the horizon, and is shedding its bright rays on the river and the  city. It looks as if all the inhabitants were astir and had made their  way to the river. Crowds are seen on the steps, some even then making  their way back after having bathed, and others going down to the stream.  Thousands are in the water. Men and women, boys and girls, are  there--the men and women at a short distance from each other.  Immediately above the water are platforms with huge stationary umbrellas  over them, and on these men are squatted, whose portly appearance  betokens ease and plenty. These are Gungaputrs--sons of the Ganges--a  class of Brahmans, whose duty it is to take care of the clothes of the  people as they bathe, to put a mark on their forehead to show they have  bathed, and who receive a small offering from them as they retire. All  bring with them their bathing-dress, and they most deftly take off and  put on their scanty clothing. When the bathing is over they wring out  the clothes in which they have bathed, fill with Ganges water a small  brazen vessel, which each person carries with him, and make their way  into the city to pay their homage to their favourite gods before  proceeding to their homes. I have been told that the very devout among  them visit some thirty temples of a morning.    You watch the people as they bathe. It is evident they are not engaged  in mere ablution, so important for health and comfort in that hot  climate. They are engaged in worship. You see them taking up the water  of the Ganges in the palm of their hands, and offering it up to the sun  as they mutter certain prescribed words. You observe them making a  circular motion, and if sufficiently near you see them breathing  heavily, which you are told is their way of driving away demons, who  even in that sacred spot are said to haunt them. There is no united  worship: each worshipper apart performs his and her devotion.

This temper, permeating, as it did, the dominant party of practically  every Northern State, was not unstintingly reflected upon the National  Capitol in the return to Congress of a large majority in both Houses,  of men who sympathized with and reflected back again upon their  constituents the most extreme views as to what should be the policy of  the Government towards the South.    These views characterized the legislation of the time. Partisan rancor  was unbridled, and found expression not only in coercive legislation of  various grades of severity, but in placing the Southern States generally  under almost absolute military control, and in the practical abrogation  of the common rights of American citizenship in most of them.    Quite every act of this sort of legislation was passed over the official  protest of the President, and each of these protests seemed but to add  emphasis to each succeeding act of Congress in that line, till it  seemed that there could be no end to the strife, so long as Mr. Johnson  remained in the Presidential office.    The ostensible basis of the disagreement which in a few months after  the accession of Mr. Johnson to the Presidency began to develop  between himself and the Republican leaders in Congress, was the plan  of reconstruction put in operation by him during the recess of Congress  that year, 1865, and outlined in his North Carolina Proclamation. It  availed not, that that plan had been adopted originally by Mr. Lincoln  a few days before his death--that it had been concurred in by his entire  Cabinet and would undoubtedly have been carried out successfully by him  had he lived that plan was made the ground of criticism of Mr. Johnson  by the extreme party element in control of Congress, which persistently  accused him of having abandoned the plan initiated by Mr. Lincoln, and  of setting up another of his own, for purely personal and ambitious  purposes, and to the detriment of the peace of the country.    Mr. Johnson may have been opinionated and headstrong, a characteristic  of a great many people of strong convictions of duty and purpose; while  the overwhelming numerical strength of the dominant party in and out of  Congress made it seemingly indifferent, reckless and inconsiderate  of the convictions, as of the rights and prerogatives of the Chief  Executive treating him more as a clerk whose sole duty it was to  register without suggestion the decrees of Congress.    That Mr. Lincoln, had he lived, would have pursued much the same policy  of reconstruction, is clearly indicated by the established fact that he  had determined to adopt precisely the initial measures thereto which  Mr. Johnson did inaugurate and attempt to carry out. But Mr. Lincoln's  superior ability in statecraft, his rare tact and knowledge of men,  and his capacity for moulding and directing public opinion, seeming  to follow where he actually led, would doubtless have secured a more  favorable result. And more than all else, it can scarcely be doubted,  that the unbounded confidence of the people in his patriotism and  capacity to direct public affairs, would have enabled him to dictate  terms of reconstruction strictly on the lines he had marked out, and  would have commanded the general support of the country, regardless of  partisan divisions, notwithstanding the well known fact that at the time  of his death there were unmistakable indications of alienation from him  of the extreme element of his party because of his conservative views as  to the proper methods of reconstruction.    Meantime, in the effort to hamper the President, as far as it was  possible for Congress to do, the Tenure-of-Office Act was passed,  early in 1867. The ostensible purpose of that Act was to restrict the  authority of the President in the selection of his Cabinet advisers, and  his power over appointments generally. Its specific purpose, at least so  far as the House of Representatives was concerned, and measurably so  in the Senate, was to prevent his removal of the Secretary of War, Mr.  Stanton, with the manifest if not avowed intent, as the sequel shows, to  make that Secretary not only independent of his chief, but also to make  him the immediate instrument of Congress in whatever disposition of the  Army, or of military affairs generally relating to the government of the  Southern States, the majority of Congress might dictate. In a word, the  Congress, in that Act, virtually assumed, or attempted to assume, that  control of the Army which the Constitution vests on the President.    The first effort to impeach the President, in 1867, was based upon  a general accusation of high crimes and misdemeanors without literal  specification. The second, in 1868, was based upon his alleged violation  of the Tenure-of-Office Act, in the removal of Mr. Stanton.    While it is undoubted, as already shown, that Mr. Lincoln and Mr.  Johnson were in accord as to the methods to be adopted for the  restoration of the revolted States, it was Mr. Johnson's misfortune that  he had not Mr. Lincoln's capacity for so great and so peculiar a task;  though a gentleman of proven patriotism, ability, of a kindly, genial  nature, and with record of valuable public service. Hampered by his lack  of political finesse and intricate knowledge of state-craft, and in view  of the conditions of that time, and the people with whom he had to deal,  it was obvious from the outset that the result of the controversy  could hardly be otherwise than disastrous to him. Mr. Lincoln would  undoubtedly have been met by the same character of opposition, and from  the same source. But there would have been the appearance at least of  mutual concession, and while the APPEARANCE of concession would have  been on Mr. Lincoln's side, the actual concession, so far as essentials  were involved, would have been on the other.    Mr. Johnson was a Democrat of pronounced type and profound convictions,  and in no sense did he depart from his faith. He belonged to the  school of Jackson and Jefferson. He had not the electric intuitions and  impetuous will of the former, nor the culture and genius of the latter.  He adhered more religiously to the letter of the Constitution than  either. To him it was the one law of supreme obligation, that never  ceased its guarantees. As fittingly expressed by one of his Counsel, Mr.  Groesbeck, in the trial: \"He was not learned and scholarly--not a man  of many ideas or of much speculation--but the Constitution had been the  study of his life, and by a law of the mind he was only the truer to  that which he did know.\"    As had Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Johnson keenly appreciated the importance of the  people of the South returning at once to the Union, free and independent  American citizens, clothed with all the rights, privileges and  obligations common to such. In his Cabinet Councils, and to a degree  supreme in that board sat William H. Seward, as he had throughout Mr.  Lincoln's administration, than whom the Republic has produced no wiser,  more sagacious, or patriotic statesman. He gave the subject his intense  devotion in the maturity of his great powers.    There too, sat Secretary Welles, another of Mr. Lincoln's advisers, and  a devoted friend of the Constitution and the sanctity of the Union. Each  of these men, thoroughly patriotic, and efficient, and untiring in the  administration of their respective Departments, had commenced with the  deluge of blood, and they now hoped to crown their official careers by  a triumphant peace that would Honor their lives and glorify the Nation.  These men had a salutary influence over Mr. Johnson, and greatly  modified the asperities of his disposition.    Mr. Johnson believed, as did Mr. Lincoln, that the revolted States were  still States of the Union--that all the pretended acts of secession  were null and void, and that the loyal people therein had the right to  reconstruct their State Governments on the basis proposed to them first  by Mr. Lincoln, and after him by Mr. Johnson, and thus the right to  representation in the General Government.    It was upon this question that parties divided during the reconstruction  period. Mr. Lincoln, foreseeing danger in such a division, was anxious  to bring those States into such relation that the people generally  would consider them as virtually in the Union, without reference to the  abstract question. It was with this view, undoubtedly, that he advocated  the admission of Members and Senators whenever one-tenth of the voting  population of 1860 should organize State Governments and ask for  readmission. He would not only not countenance, but repelled the  doctrine of \"State Suicide,\" as it was called, and which came to  characterize the methods of reconstruction subsequently adopted.    It is true, that on many occasions Mr. Johnson charged that the Congress  was only a Congress of part of the States, and that its acts were  therefore without validity. Yet he continued to execute those laws,  and what to him was a very unpleasant duty, the law which set aside  the State Governments organized under his own direction, so that  notwithstanding his violent denunciations of the acts of Congress, and  his personal opinions, he did not presume to act upon them. Angry and  undignified language was uttered on both sides. Many of his"]]]
