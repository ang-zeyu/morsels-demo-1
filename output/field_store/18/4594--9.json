Vol. 1 (of 2) (#12)"],[1,"     'I propose therefore, that by an _Act_ of this present       _Parliament_, this infernal _Nuisance_ be removed.'    There is no beating about the bush here, and no mincing of phrases. The  matter is at once probed with the needle.    Evelyn was not merely a rather notable person in the London society of  that period. As a man of science he was one of the most prominent  pillars of the then recently founded Royal Society. As an official he  was His Majesty's Commissioner for improving the streets and buildings  of London, in addition to various other particular duties. But  finally,--and, at the same time, first of all, if it be permissible to  emphasise the fact in so paradoxical a manner--he was a courtier; and  that at a time when expressions of loyalty to His Gracious Majesty,  King Charles II., were somewhat too highly coloured, too servile and  sycophantic, to suit our modern taste.    This short work _Fumifugium_, really only a pamphlet, was therefore  dedicated to the King in language of the period extravagant in the  highest degree, though eminently typical of the Royalists during the  early days of the Restoration. The treatise was thus occasioned:-- 'It  was one day, as I was Walking in Your Majesty's Palace at White-Hall  (where I have sometimes the honour to refresh myself with the Sight of  Your Illustrious Presence, which is the Joy of Your Peoples hearts) that  a presumptuous Smoak issuing from one or two tunnels near  _Northumberland House_, and not far from _Scotland-yard_ did so invade  the Court; that all the Rooms, Galleries, and Places about it were  fill'd and infested with it; and that to such a degree, as Men could  hardly discern one another from the Clowd, and none could support,  without manifest Inconveniency. It was not this which did first suggest  to me what I had long since conceived against this pernicious Accident,  upon frequent observation; But it was this alone, and the trouble that  it must needs procure to Your Sacred Majesty, as well as hazzard to Your  Health, which kindled this Indignation of mine against it, and was the  occasion of what it has produc'd in these Papers.    Sir, I prepare in this short Discourse an expedient how this pernicious  _Nuisance_ may be reformed; and offer at another also, by which the  _Aer_ may not only be freed from the present Inconveniency; but (that  remov'd) to render not only Your Majesties Palace, but the whole City  likewise, one of the sweetest, and most delicious Habitations in the  World; and this, with little or no expence; but by improving those  Plantations which Your Majesty so laudably affects, in the moyst,  depressed and marshy grounds about the Town, to the Culture and  production of such things, as upon every gentle emission through the  _Aer_, should so perfume the adjacent places with their breath; as if,  by a certain charm, or innocent _Magick_, they were transferred to that  part of _Arabia_, which is therefore styled the _Happy_, because it is  amongst the Gums and precious spices.'    Objectionable cottages had thus apparently only recently, probably  during the democratic Commonwealth, been erected to the east of  Whitehall, and were surrounded by fields. These fields were to be  divided into blocks of about 20 to 40 acres, and palisades or fences of  shrubs were to enclose belts of 150 feet or more between the various  fields. The fences were to be formed or filled with sweetbriar,  periclymena, woodbine, jessamine, syringa, guelder-rose, musk and other  roses, broom, juniper, lavender, and so on,--'but above all _Rosemary_,  the _Flowers_ whereof are credibly reported to give their sent above  thirty Leagues off at Sea, upon the coasts of Spain. Those who take  notice of the Sent of the _Orange_-flowers from the Rivage of Genoea, and  _St. Pietro dell' Arena_; the Blosomes of _Rosemary_ from the Coasts of  _Spain_ many leagues off at Sea; or the manifest and odoriferous wafts  which flow from _Fontenoy_ and _Vaugirard_, even to _Paris_ in the  season of _Roses_, with the contrary Effects of those less pleasing  smells from other accidents, will easily consent to what I suggest: And,  I am able to enumerate a Catalogue of native _Plants_, and such as are  familiar to our Country and Clime, whose redolent and agreeable  Emissions would even ravish our senses, as well as perfectly improve the  _Aer_ about _London_; and that, without the least prejudice to the  Owners and Proprietors of the Land to be employ'd about it.' Evelyn  further recommended 'That the _Spaces_, or _Area_ between these  _Pallisads_, and _Fences_, be employ'd in Beds and Bordures of _Pinks_,  _Carnations_, _Clove_, _Stock-gilly-flower_, _Primroses_, _Auriculas_,  _Violets_, not forgetting the _White_, which are in flower twice a year,  _April_ and _August_; _Cowslips_, _Lillies_, _Narcissus_,  _Strawberries_, whose very leaves as well as fruit, emit a _Cardiague_,  and most refreshing _Halitus_: also _Parietria Lutea_, _Musk_, _Lemmon_,  and _Mastick_: _Thyme_, _Spike_, _Cammomile_, _Balm_, _Mint_,  _Marjoram_, _Pimpernel_, _Serpillum_, etc., which upon the least  pressure and cutting, breathe out and betray their ravishing Odors.'  Plantations of trees were also to be made and nurseries formed, which  would have the additional advantage, besides mere beauty and ornament,  of providing for the fields--'better Shelter, and Pasture for Sheep and  Cattel then now; that they lie bleak, expos'd and abandon'd to the  winds, which perpetually invade them.' It is said that the planting of  Lime trees in St. James' Park was due to these suggestions. Evelyn's  recommendations concluded with the exhorting that 'the further  exhorbitant encrease of _Tenements_, poor and nasty _Cottages_ near the  City, be prohibited, which disgrace and take off from the sweetness and  amoenity of the Environs of _London_, and are already become a great  _Eye-sore_ in the grounds opposite to _His Majesty's Palace_ of  _White-hall_; which being converted to this use, might yield a diversion  inferior to none that could be imagin'd for _Health_, _Profit_, and  _Beauty_, which are the three _Transcendencies_ that render a place  without all exception. And _this_ is what (in short) I had to offer, for  the _Improvement_ and _Melioration_ of the _Aer_ about _London_, and  with which I shall conclude this discourse.'    Besides dedicating his pamphlet especially to the King, as well as  proposing, on the title-page, the remedy \"To His Sacred Majestie, and To  the Parliament now Assembled\", Evelyn likewise adresses himself \"To the  Reader\" by way of a second introduction; and he does so in these plainer  and rather contemptuous terms:-- 'I have little here to add to implore  thy good opinion and approbation, after I have submitted this Essay to  his Sacred Majesty: But as it is of universal benefit that I propound  it; so I expect a civil entertainment and reception....' Confessing  himself 'frequently displeased at the small advance and improvement of  Publick Works in this nation,' he further expresses himself as  'extremely amazed, that where there is so great affluence of all things  which may render the People of this vast City the most happy upon Earth;  the sordid and accursed Avarice of some few Particular Persons should be  suffered to prejudice the health and felicity of so many: That any  Profit (besides what is absolute necessity) should render men  regardlesse of what chiefly imports them, when it may be purchased upon  so easie conditions, and with so great advantages: For it is not  happiness to possesse Gold, but to enjoy the Effects of it and to know  how to live cheerfully and in health, _Non est vivere, sed valere vita_.  That men whose very Being is _Aer_, should not breath it freely when  they may; but (as that _Tyrant_ us'd his Vassals) condemn themselves to  this misery and _Fumo praefocari_, is strange stupidity: yet thus we see  them walk and converse in _London_, pursu'd and haunted by that  infernal Smoake, and the funest accidents which accompany it wheresoever  they retire.'    Surely, if John Evelyn could in spirit revisit the metropolis he loved  so well and was so much at home in, he would, while lamenting the  continuation and the now much more acute form of the \"infernal  _Nuisance_\", to a certainty find ample cause for rejoicing at the  admirable work of late years carried out in the London Royal Parks and  Pleasure Grounds, and in the Parks and Open Spaces under the  administration of the County Council.    It was in 1664, however, that Evelyn achieved his greatest literary  triumph by the publication of his three masterpieces, _Sylva: or a  Discourse of Forest Trees, and the Propagation of Timber in His  Majestie's Dominions_; _Pomona: or an Appendix concerning Fruit Trees in  relation to Cider, the Making and several ways of Ordering it_; and  _Kalendarium Hortense: or the Gard'ners Almanack, directing what he is  to do Monthly throughout the Year_.'    The manner in which the idea of the _Sylva_ originated is clearly shewn  by what is noted in his Diary on 15th October, 1662.--'I this day  deliver'd my \"Discourse concerning Forest Trees\" to the Society, upon  occasion of certain queries sent to us by the Commissioners of his  Majesties Navy, being the first booke that was printed by order of the  Society, and by their printer, since it was a Corporation.' This latter  reference evidently anticipates events, as one often had reason to note  in this so-called diary, because Sylva was not actually published until  the beginning of 1664, when along with it were included _Pomona_, and  the _Kalendarium Hortense_. In February, 1664, '16th, I presented my  \"Sylva\" to the Society; and next day to his Majestie, to whom it was  dedicated; also to the Lord Treasurer and the Lord Chancellor.'    There is no doubt that _Sylva_ was a work of national importance. Then,  as now, England was dependent on her Navy. But the stock of Oak timber  suitable "]]]
