Wykes, p. 59.         ** Chron. T. Wykes, p. 57.         *** Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 358. Trivet, p. 211.    He agreed to confirm anew the provisions of Oxford, even those which  entirely annihilated the royal authority; and the barons were again  reinstated in the sovereignty of the kingdom. They restored Hugh le  Despenser to the office of chief justiciary: they appointed their own  creatures sheriffs in every county of England; they took possession of  all the royal castles and fortresses; they even named all the officers  of the king's household; and they summoned a parliament to meet at  Westminster, in order to settle more fully their plan of government.  They here produced a new list of twenty-four barons, to whom they  proposed that the administration should be entirely committed; and  they insisted that the authority of this junto should continue not only  during the reign of the king, but also during that of Prince Edward.    This prince, the life and soul of the royal party, had unhappily,  before the king's accommodation with the barons, been taken prisoner by  Leicester in a parley at Windsor;[*] and that misfortune, more than  any other incident, had determined Henry to submit to the ignominious  conditions imposed upon him. But Edward, having recovered his liberty by  the treaty, employed his activity in defending the prerogatives of his  family; and he gained a great party even among-those who had at first  adhered to the cause of the barons. His cousin, Henry d'Allmaine, Roger  Bigod, earl mareschal, Earl Warrenne, Humphrey Bohun, earl of Hereford,  John Lord Basset, Ralph Basset, Hammond l'Estrange, Roger Mortimer, Henry  de Piercy, Robert de Brus, Roger de Leybourne, with almost all the lords  marchers, as they were called, on the borders of Wales and of Scotland,  the most warlike parts of the kingdom, declared in favor of the royal  cause; and hostilities, which were scarcely well composed, were again  renewed in every part of England. But the near balance of the parties,  joined to the universal clamor of the people, obliged the king and  barons to open anew the negotiations for peace; and it was agreed by  both sides to submit their differences to the arbitration of the king of  France.[**]         * M. Paris, p. 669. Trivet, p. 213.         ** M. Paris, p. 668, Chron. T. Wykes, p. 58. W. Heming, p.       580. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 363.    {1264.} This virtuous prince, the only man, who, in like circumstances,  could safely have been intrusted with such an authority by a neighboring  nation, had never ceased to interpose his good, offices between the  English factions, and had, even, during the short interval of peace,  invited over to Paris both the king and the earl of Leicester, in order  to accommodate the differences between them, but found that the fears  and animosities on both sides, as well as the ambition of Leicester,  were so violent, as to render all his endeavors ineffectual. But when  this solemn appeal, ratified by the oaths and subscriptions of  the leaders in both factions, was made to his judgment, he was not  discouraged from pursuing his honorable purpose: he summoned the states  of France at Amiens; and there, in the presence of that assembly,  as well as in that of the king of England and Peter de Mountfort,  Leicester's son, he brought this great cause to a trial and examination.  It appeared to him, that the provisions of Oxford, even had they not  been extorted by force, had they not been so exorbitant in their nature  and subversive of the ancient constitution, were expressly established  as a temporary expedient, and could not, without breach of trust,  be rendered perpetual by the barons. He therefore annulled these  provisions; restored to the king the possession of his castles, and the  power of nomination to the great offices; allowed him to retain what  foreigners he pleased in his kingdom, and even to confer on them places  of trust and dignity; and, in a word, reestablished the royal power  in the same condition on which it stood before the meeting of  the parliament at Oxford. But while he thus suppressed dangerous  innovations, and preserved unimpaired the prerogatives of the English  crown, he was not negligent of the rights of the people; and besides  ordering that a general amnesty should be granted for all past offences,  he declared, that his award was not anywise meant to derogate from  the privileges and liberties which the nation enjoyed by any former  concessions or charters of the crown.[*]    This equitable sentence was no sooner known in England, than Leicester  and his confederates determined to reject it and to have recourse  to arms, in order to procure to themselves more safe and advantageous  conditions.[**]         * Rymer, vol. i. p. 776, 777, etc. Chron. T. Wykes, p. 58.       Knyghton, p. 2446.         ** Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 363.    Without regard to his oaths and subscriptions, that enterprising  conspirator directed his two sons, richard and Peter de Mountfort, in  conjunction with Robert de Ferrers, earl of Derby, to attack the city of  Worcester; while Henry and Simon de Mountfort, two others of his sons,  assisted by the prince of Wales, were ordered to lay waste the estate  of Roger de Mortimer. He himself resided at London; and employing as  his instrument Fitz-Richard, the seditious mayor, who had violently  and illegally prolonged his authority, he wrought up that city to the  highest ferment and agitation. The populace formed themselves into  bands and companies; chose leaders; practised all military exercises;  committed violence on the royalists; and to give them greater  countenance in their disorders, an association was entered into between  the city and eighteen great barons, never to make peace with the king  but by common consent and approbation. At the head of those who swore to  maintain this association, were the earls of Leicester, Glocester,  and Derby, with Le Despenser, the chief justiciary; men who had all  previously sworn to submit to the award of the French monarch. Their  only pretence for this breach of faith was, that the latter part of  Lewis's sentence was, as they affirmed, a contradiction to the former.  He ratified the charter of liberties, yet annulled the provisions of  Oxford, which were only calculated, as they maintained, to preserve that  charter; and without which, in their estimation, they had no security for  its observance.    The king and prince, finding a civil war inevitable, prepared themselves  for defence; and summoning the military vassals from all quarters, and  being reinforced by Baliol, lord of Galloway, Brus, lord of Annandale,  Henry Piercy, John Comyn,[*] and other barons of the north, they  composed an army, formidable as well from its numbers as its military  prowess and experience. The first enterprise of the royalists was the  attack of Northampton, which was defended by Simon de Mountfort, with  many of the principal barons of that party: and a breach being; made in  the walls by Philip Basset, the place was carried by assault, and both  the governor and the garrison were made prisoners. The royalists marched  thence to Leicester and Nottingham; both which places having opened  their gates to them, Prince Edward proceeded with a detachment into the  county of Derby, in order to ravage with fire and sword the lands of  the earl of that name, and take revenge on, him for his disloyalty.  Like maxims of war prevailed with both parties throughout England; and  the kingdom was thus exposed in a moment to greater devastation, from  the animosities of the rival barons, than it would have suffered from  many years of foreign or even domestic hostilities, conducted by more  humane and more generous principles.         * Rymer, vol. i. p. 772. M. West. p. 385. Ypod. Neust. p.       469.    The earl of Leicester, master of London, and of the counties in the  south-east of England, formed the siege of Rochester, which alone  declared for the king in those parts, and which, besides Earl Warrenne,  the governor, was garrisoned by many noble and powerful barons of the  royal party. The king and prince hastened from Nottingham, where they  were then quartered, to the relief of the place; and on their approach,  Leicester raised the siege and retreated to London, which, being the  centre of his power, he was afraid might, in his absence, fall into the  king's hands, either by force or by a correspondence with the principal  citizens, who were all secretly inclined to the royal cause. Reenforced  [**unusual spelling but that is what it looks like] by a great body  of Londoners, and having summoned his partisans from all quarters,  he thought himself strong enough to hazard a general battle with  the royalists, and to determine the fate of the nation in one great  engagement, which, if it proved successful, must be decisive against  the king, who had no retreat for his broken troops in those parts, while  Leicester himself, in case of any sinister accident, could easily  take shelter in the city. To give the better coloring to his cause, he  previously sent a message with conditions of peace to Henry, submissive  in the language, but exorbitant in the demands;[*] and when the  messenger returned with the lie and defiance from the king, the prince,  and the king of the Romans, he sent a new message, renouncing, in the  name of himself and of the associated barons, all fealty and allegiance  to Henry. He then marched out of the city with his army, divided into  four bodies: the first commanded by his two sons, Henry and Guy de  Mountfort, together with Humphrey de Bohun, earl of Hereford, who had  deserted to the barons; the second led by the earl of Glocester, with  William de Montchesney and John"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19213"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part C. (#12)"],[1,"expectations of  his partisans. Having collected a band of outlaws, pirates, robbers, and  necessitous persons of all nations, to the number of six hundred men,  he put to sea, with a resolution of making a descent in England, and of  exciting the common people to arms, since all his correspondence with  the nobility was cut off by Henry vigilance and severity. Information  being brought him that the king had made a progress to the north, he  cast anchor on the coast of Kent, and sent some of his retainers ashore,  who invited the country to join him. The gentlemen of Kent assembled  some troops to oppose him; but they purposed to do more essential  service than by repelling the invasion: they carried the semblance of  friendship to Perkin, and invited him to come himself ashore, in order  to take the command over them. But the wary youth, observing that they  had more order and regularity in their movements than could be supposed  in new levied forces who had taken arms against established authority,  refused to intrust himself into their hands; and the Kentish troops,  despairing of success in their stratagem, fell upon such of his  retainers as were already landed; and besides some whom they slew, they  took a hundred and fifty prisoners. These were tried and condemned and  all of them executed, by orders from the king, who was resolved to use  no lenity towards men of such desperate fortunes.[*]         * Polyd. Virg. p. 595.    This year a parliament was summoned in England, and another in Ireland;  and some remarkable laws were passed in both countries. The English  parliament enacted, that no person who should by arms, or otherwise  assist the king for the time being, should ever afterwards, either by  course of law or act of parliament, be attainted for such an instance of  obedience. This statute might be exposed to some censure, as favorable  to usurpers; were there any precise rule, which always, even during  the most factious times, could determine the true successor, and render  every one inexcusable who did not submit to him. But as the titles of  princes are then the great subject of dispute, and each party pleads  topics in its own favor, it seems but equitable to secure those who act  in support of public tranquillity, an object at all times of undoubted  benefit and importance. Henry, conscious of his disputed title, promoted  this law, in order to secure his partisans against all events; but as  he had himself observed a contrary practice with regard to Richard's  adherents, he had reason to apprehend that, during the violence which  usually ensues on public convulsions, his example, rather than his law,  would, in case of a new revolution, be followed by his enemies. And the  attempt to bind the legislature itself, by prescribing rules to future  parliaments, was contradictory to the plainest principles of political  government.    This parliament also passed an act, empowering the king to levy, by  course of law, all the sums which any person had agreed to pay by way  of benevolence; a statute by which that arbitrary method of taxation was  indirectly authorized and justified.    The king's authority appeared equally prevalent and uncontrolled in  Ireland. Sir Edward Poynings had been sent over to that country, with  an intention of quelling the partisans of the house of York, and of  reducing the natives to subjection. He was not supported by forces  sufficient for that enterprise: the Irish, by flying into their woods,  and morasses, and mountains, for some time eluded his efforts; but  Poynings summoned a parliament at Dublin, where he was more successful.  He passed that memorable statute, which still bears his name, and which  establishes the authority of the English government in Ireland. By this  statute, all the former laws of England were made to be of force in  Ireland; and no bill can be introduced into the Irish parliament, unless  it previously receive the sanction of the council of England. This  latter clause seems calculated for insuring the dominion of the English;  but was really granted at the desire of the Irish commons who intended,  by that means, to secure themselves from the tyranny of their lords,  particularly of such lieutenants or deputies as were of Irish birth.[*]         * Sir John Davis, p. 236.    While Henry's authority was thus established throughout his dominions,  and general tranquillity prevailed, the whole continent was thrown into  combustion by the French invasion of Italy, and by the rapid success  which attended Charles in that rash and ill-concerted enterprise. The  Italians, who had entirely lost the use of arms, and who, in the midst  of continual wars, had become every day more unwarlike, were astonished  to meet an enemy that made the field of battle, not a pompous  tournament, but a scene of blood, and sought, at the hazard of their own  lives, the death of their enemy. Their effeminate troops were dispersed  every where on the approach of the French army: their best fortified  cities opened their gates: kingdoms and states were in an instant  overturned; and through the whole length of Italy, which the French  penetrated without resistance, they seemed rather to be taking quarters  in their own country, than making conquests over an enemy. The maxims  which the Italians during that age followed in negotiations, were as  ill calculated to support their states, as the habits to which they were  addicted in war: a treacherous, deceitful, and inconsistent system of  politics prevailed; and even those small remains of fidelity and honor,  which were preserved in the councils of the other European princes, were  ridiculed in Italy, as proofs of ignorance and rusticity. Ludovico, duke  of Milan, who invited the French to invade Naples, had never desired  or expected their success; and was the first that felt terror from the  prosperous issue of those projects which he himself had concerted. By  his intrigues, a league was formed among several potentates, to oppose  the progress of Charles's conquests, and secure their own independency.  This league was composed of Ludovico himself, the pope, Maximilian, king  of the Romans, Ferdinand of Spain, and the republic of Venice. Henry too  entered into the confederacy; but was not put to any expense or trouble  in consequence of his engagements. The king of France, terrified by so  powerful a combination, retired from Naples with the greater part of  his army, and returned to France. The forces which he left in his new  conquest were, partly by the revolt of the inhabitants, partly by the  invasion of the Spaniards, soon after subdued; and the whole kingdom  of Naples suddenly returned to its allegiance under Ferdinand, son to  Alphonso, who had been suddenly expelled by the irruption of the  French. Ferdinand died soon after, and left his uncle Frederick in full  possession of the throne.            CHAPTER XXVI.          HENRY VII.      {1495.} After Perkin was repulsed from the coast of Kent, he retired  into Flanders; but as he found it impossible to procure subsistence for  himself and his followers while he remained in tranquillity, he soon  after made an attempt upon Ireland, which had always appeared forward  to join every invader of Henry's authority. But Poynings had now put the  affairs of that island in so good a posture, that Perkin met with little  success; and being tired of the savage life which he was obliged to  lead, while skulking among the wild Irish, he bent his course towards  Scotland, and presented himself to James IV., who then governed that  kingdom. He had been previously recommended to this prince by the king  of France, who was disgusted at Henry for entering into the general  league against him; and this recommendation was even seconded by  Maximilian, who, though one of the confederates, was also displeased  with the king, on account of his prohibiting in England all commerce  with the Low Countries. The countenance given to Perkin by these princes  procured him a favorable reception with the king of Scotland, who  assured him, that, whatever he were, he never should repent putting  himself in his hands:[*] the insinuating address and plausible behavior  of the youth himself, seem to have gained him credit and authority.  James, whom years had not yet taught distrust or caution, was seduced to  believe the story of Perkin's birth and adventures; and he carried his  confidence so far as to give him in marriage the lady Catharine Gordon,  daughter of the earl of Huntley, and related to himself; a young lady  too, eminent for virtue as well as beauty.         * Bacon, p. 615. Polyd. Virg. p. 596, 597.    {1496.} There subsisted at that time a great jealousy between the courts  of England and Scotland; and James was probably the more forward on that  account to adopt any fiction which he thought might reduce his enemy  to distress or difficulty. He suddenly resolved to make an inroad into  England, attended by some of the borderers; and he carried Perkin along  with him, in hopes that the appearance of the pretended prince might  raise an insurrection in the northern counties. Perkin himself dispersed  a manifesto, in which he set forth his own story, and craved the  assistance of all his subjects in expelling the usurper, whose tyranny  and maladministration, whose depression of the nobility by the  elevation of mean persons, whose oppression of the people by multiplied  impositions and vexations, had justly, he said, rendered him odious  to all men. But Perkin's pretensions, attended with repeated  disappointments, were now become stale in the eyes even of the populace;  and the hostile dispositions which subsisted between the kingdoms,  rendered a prince supported by the Scots but an unwelcome present to the  English nation. The ravages also committed by the borderers, accustomed  to license and disorder, struck a terror into all men, and made the  people prepare"]]]
