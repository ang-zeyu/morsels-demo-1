This device succeeded. Pat and his friends were put on  duty, for trial, on the night of the 26th; and, the foreman of the  corking-room being satisfied, they retained their engagements till New  Year's eve, when they were paid three dollars each, and resigned their  positions.    \"Let's buy her three shoes!\" said Bill, in enthusiasm at their success.  But this proposal was rejected. Each of the other boys had a private  plan for an extra present to \"her\" by this time. The sacred six dollars  was folded up in a bit of straw paper from the brewery, and the young  gentlemen went home to make their toilets, a process they had had no  chance to go through, on Christmas eve. After this, there was really no  difficulty about their going into the shoe-shop, and none about  consummating the purchase,--to the utter astonishment of the dealer. The  gold shoes were bought, rolled up in paper, and ready for delivery.    Bill Floyd had meanwhile learned, by inquiry at the chapel, where she  lived, though there were doubts whether any of them knew her name. The  others rejected his proposals that they should take street cars, and  they boldly pushed afoot up to Clinton Avenue, and rang, not without  terror, at the door.    Terror did not diminish when black George appeared, whose acquaintance  they had made at the tree. But fortunately George did not recognize them  in their apparel of elegance. When they asked for the \"lady that gave  the tree,\" he bade them wait a minute, and in less than a minute Alice  came running out to meet them. To the boys' great delight, she was not  crying now.    \"If you please, ma'am,\" said Tom, who had been commissioned as  spokesman,--\"if you please, them's our Christmas present to you, ma'am.  Them's gold shoes. And please, ma'am, we're very sorry there was such  a row at the Christmas, ma'am. It was mean, ma'am. Good-by, ma'am.\"    Alice's eyes were opening wider and wider, nor at this moment did she  understand. \"Gold shoes,\" and \"row at the Christmas,\" stuck by her,  however; and she understood there was a present. So, of course, she said  the right thing, by accident, and did the right thing, being a lady  through and through.    \"No, you must not go away. Come in, boys, come in. I did not know you,  you know.\" As how should she. \"Come in and sit down.\"    \"Can't ye take off your hat?\" said Tom, in an aside to Pat, who had  neglected this reverence as he entered. And Tom was thus a little  established in his own esteem.    And Alice opened the parcel, and had her presence of mind by this time;  and, amazed as she was at the gold shoes, showed no amazement,--nay,  even slipped off her own slipper, and showed that the gold shoe fitted,  to the delight of Tom, who was trying to explain that the man would  change them if they were too small. She found an apple for each boy,  thanked and praised each one separately; and the interview would have  been perfect, had she not innocently asked Tom what was the matter with  his eye. Tom's eye! Why, it was the black eye John Flagg gave him. I am  sorry to say Bill Floyd sniggered; but Pat came to the front this time,  and said \"a man hurt him.\" Then Alice produced some mittens, which had  been left, and asked whose those were. But the boys did not know.    \"I say, fellars, I'm going down to the writing-school, at the Union,\"  said Pat, when they got into the street, all of them being in the mood  that conceals emotion. \"I say, let's all go.\"    To this they agreed.    \"I say, I went there last week Monday, with Meg McManus. I say, fellars,  it's real good fun.\"    The other fellows, having on the unfamiliar best rig, were well aware  that they must not descend to their familiar haunts, and all consented.    To the amazement of the teacher, these three hulking boys allied  themselves to the side of order, took their places as they were bidden,  turned the public opinion of the class, and made the Botany Bay of the  school to be its quietest class that night.    To his amazement the same result followed the next night. And to his  greater amazement, the next.    To Alice's amazement, she received on Twelfth Night a gilt valentine  envelope, within which, on heavily ruled paper, were announced these  truths:--        MARM,--The mitins wur Nora Killpatrick's. She lives inn Water      street place behind the Lager Brewery.            Yours to command,                          WILLIAM FLOYD.                          THOMAS MULLIGAN.                          PATRICK CREHORE.    The names which they could copy from signs were correctly spelled.    To Pat's amazement, Tom Mulligan held on at the writing-school all  winter. When it ended, he wrote the best hand of any of them.    To my amazement, one evening when I looked in at Longman's, two years to  a day after Alice's tree, a bright black-eyed young man, who had tied up  for me the copy of Masson's \"Milton,\" which I had given myself for a  Christmas present, said: \"You don't remember me.\" I owned innocence.    \"My name is Mulligan--Thomas Mulligan. Would you thank Mr. John Flagg,  if you meet him, for a Christmas present he gave me two years ago, at  Miss Alice MacNeil's Christmas-tree. It was the best present I ever had,  and the only one I ever deserved.\"    And I said I would do so.           *       *       *       *       *    I told Alice afterward never to think she was going to catch all the  fish there were in any school. I told her to whiten the water with  ground-bait enough for all, and to thank God if her heavenly fishing  were skilful enough to save one.          DAILY BREAD.      I.    A QUESTION OF NOURISHMENT.    \"And how is he?\" said Robert, as he came in from his day's work, in  every moment of which he had thought of his child. He spoke in a whisper  to his wife, who met him in the narrow entry at the head of the stairs.  And in a whisper she replied.    \"He is certainly no worse,\" said Mary: \"the doctor says, maybe a shade  better. At least,\" she said, sitting on the lower step, and holding her  husband's hand, and still whispering,--\"at least he said that the  breathing seemed to him a shade easier, one lung seemed to him a little  more free, and that it is now a question of time and nourishment.\"    \"Nourishment?\"    \"Yes, nourishment,--and I own my heart sunk as he said so. Poor little  thing, he loathes the slops, and I told the doctor so. I told him the  struggle and fight to get them down his poor little throat gave him more  flush and fever than any thing. And then he begged me not to try that  again, asked if there were really nothing that the child would take, and  suggested every thing so kindly. But the poor little thing, weak as he  is, seems to rise up with supernatural strength against them all. I am  not sure, though, but perhaps we may do something with the old milk and  water: that is really my only hope now, and that is the reason I spoke  to you so cheerfully.\"    Then poor Mary explained more at length that Emily had brought in Dr.  Cummings's Manual[1] about the use of milk with children, and that they  had sent round to the Corlisses', who always had good milk, and had set  a pint according to the direction and formula,--and that though dear  little Jamie had refused the groats and the barley, and I know not what  else, that at six he had gladly taken all the watered milk they dared to  give him, and that it now had rested on his stomach half an hour, so  that she could not but hope that the tide had turned, only she hoped  with trembling, because he had so steadily refused cow's milk only the  week before.        [1] Has the reader a delicate infant? Let him send for          Dr. Cummings's little book on Milk for Children.    This rapid review in her entry, of the bulletins of a day, is really the  beginning of this Christmas story. No matter which day it was,--it was a  little before Christmas, and one of the shortest days, but I have  forgotten which. Enough that the baby, for he was a baby still, just  entering his thirteenth month,--enough that he did relish the milk, so  carefully measured and prepared, and hour by hour took his little dole  of it as if it had come from his mother's breast. Enough that three or  four days went by so, the little thing lying so still on his back in his  crib, his lips still so blue, and his skin of such deadly color against  the white of his pillow, and that, twice a day, as Dr. Morton came in  and felt his pulse, and listened to the panting, he smiled and looked  pleased, and said, \"We are getting on better than I dared expect.\" Only  every time he said, \"Does he still relish the milk?\" and every time was  so pleased to know that he took to it still, and every day he added a  teaspoonful or two to the hourly dole,--and so poor Mary's heart was  lifted day by day.    This lasted till St. Victoria's day. Do you know which day that is? It  is the second day before Christmas; and here, properly speaking, the  story begins.      II.    ST. VICTORIA'S DAY.    St. Victoria's day the doctor was full two hours late. Mary was not  anxious about this. She was beginning to feel bravely about the boy, and  no longer counted the minutes till she could hear the door-bell ring.  When he came he loitered in the entry below,--or she thought he did. He  was long coming up stairs. And when he came in she saw that he was  excited by something,--was really even then panting for breath.    \"I am here at last,\" he said. \"Did you think I should fail you?\"    Why, no,--poor innocent Mary had not thought any such thing. She had  known he would come,--and baby was so well that she had not minded his  delay.    Morton looked up at the close drawn shades, which shut out the light,  and said, \"You did not think of the storm?\"    \"Storm? no!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32530"],[0,"Armageddon—2419 A.D. (#13)"],[1,"never been able to understand. Had not the night  been an unusually still one, he could not have checked the initial  pendulum-like movements. As it was, there was considerable air current  at certain of the levels, and in different directions too. But Gibbons  was an expert of rare ability and sensitivity in the handling of a  rocket ship, and he managed, with the aid of his delicate instruments,  to sense the drifts almost before they affected the fine ultron wire,  and to neutralize them with little shifts in the position of the ship.    Blash and Gaunt fastened their rings to the wire, and I hooked my own  and Wilma's on, too. But on looking around, I found Barker was still  missing.    \"Barker, come!\" I called. \"We're waiting.\"    \"Coming!\" he replied, and indeed, at that instant, his figure appeared  up the ramp. He chuckled as he fastened his ring to the wire, and said  something about a little surprise he had left for the Hans.    \"Don't reel in the wire more than a few hundred feet,\" I instructed  Gibbons. \"It will take too long to wind it in. We'll float up, and when  we're aboard, we can drop it.\"    In order to float up, we had to dispense with a pound or two of weight  apiece. We hurled our swords from us, and kicked off our shoes as  Gibbons reeled up the line a bit, and then letting go of the wire, began  to hum upward on our rings with increasing velocity.    The rush of air brought Wilma to, and I hastily explained to her that we  had been successful. Receding far below us now, I could see our dully  shining knob swinging to and fro in an ever widening arc, as it crossed  and recrossed the black square of the tower roof. As an extra  precaution, I ordered Gibbons to shut off the light, and to show one  from the belly of the ship, for so great was our speed now, that I began  to fear we would have difficulty in checking ourselves. We were  literally falling upward, and with terrific acceleration.    Fortunately, we had several minutes in which to solve this difficulty,  which none of us, strangely enough, had foreseen. It was Gibbons who  found the answer.    \"You'll be all right if all of you grab the wire tight when I give the  word,\" he said. \"First I'll start reeling it in at full speed. You won't  get much of a jar, and then I'll decrease its speed again gradually, and  its weight will hold you back. Are you ready? One--two--three!\"    We all grabbed tightly with our gloved hands as he gave the word. We  must have been rising a good bit faster than he figured, however, for it  wrenched our arms considerably, and the maneuver set up a sickening  pendulum motion.    For a while all we could do was swing there in an arc that may have been  a quarter of a mile across, about three and a half miles above the city,  and still more than a mile from our ship.    Gibbons skilfully took up the slack as our momentum pulled up the line.  Then at last we had ourselves under control again, and continued our  upward journey, checking our speed somewhat with our gloves.    There was not one of us who did not breathe a big sigh of relief when we  scrambled through the hatch safely into the ship again, cast off the  ultron line and slammed the trap shut.    Little realizing that we had a still more terrible experience to go  through, we discussed the information Blash and Gaunt had between them  extracted from the Han records, and the advisability of ultrophoning  Hart at once.          CHAPTER X    The Walls of Hell      The traitors were, it seemed, a degenerate gang of Americans, located a  few miles north of Nu-yok on the wooded banks of the Hudson, the  Sinsings. They had exchanged scraps of information to the Hans in return  for several old repellor-ray machines, and the privilege of tuning in on  the Han electronic power broadcast for their operation, provided their  ships agreed to subject themselves to the orders of the Han traffic  office, while aloft.    The rest wanted to ultrophone their news at once, since there was always  danger that we might never get back to the gang with it.    I objected, however. The Sinsings would be likely to pick up our  message. Even if we used the directional projector, they might have  scouts out to the west and south in the big inter-gang stretches of  country. They would flee to Nu-yok and escape the punishment they  merited. It seemed to be vitally important that they should not, for the  sake of example to other weak groups among the American gangs, as well  as to prevent a crisis in which they might clear more vital information  to the enemy.    \"Out to sea again,\" I ordered Gibbons. \"They'll be less likely to look  for us in that direction.\"    \"Easy, Boss, easy,\" he replied. \"Wait until we get up a mile or two  more. They must have discovered evidences of our raid by now, and their  dis-ray wall may go in operation any moment.\"    Even as he spoke, the ship lurched downward and to one side.    \"There it is!\" he shouted. \"Hang on, everybody. We're going to nose  straight up!\" And he flipped the rocket-motor control wide open.    Looking through one of the rear ports, I could see a nebulous, luminous  ring, and on all sides the atmosphere took on a faint iridescence.    We were almost over the destructive range of the disintegrator-ray wall,  a hollow cylinder of annihilation shooting upward from a solid ring of  generators surrounding the city. It was the main defense system of the  Hans, which had never been used except in periodic tests. They may or  may not have suspected that an American rocket ship was within the  cylinder; probably they had turned on their generators more as a  precaution to prevent any reaching a position above the city.    But even at our present great height, we were in great danger. It was a  question how much we might have been harmed by the rays themselves, for  their effective range was not much more than seven or eight miles. The  greater danger lay in the terrific downward rush of air within the  cylinder to replace that which was being burned into nothingness by the  continual play of the disintegrators. The air fell into the cylinder  with the force of a gale. It would be rushing toward the wall from the  outside with terrific force also, but, naturally, the effect was  intensified on the interior.    Our ship vibrated and trembled. We had only one chance of escape--to  fight our way well above the current. To drift down with it meant  ultimately, and inevitably, to be sucked into the destruction wall at  some lower level.    But very gradually and jerkily our upward movement, as shown on the  indicators, began to increase, and after an hour of desperate struggle  we were free of the maelstrom and into the rarefied upper levels. The  terror beneath us was now invisible through several layers of cloud  formations.    Gibbons brought the ship back to an even keel, and drove her eastward  into one of the most brilliantly gorgeous sunrises I have ever seen.    We described a great circle to the south and west, in a long easy dive,  for he had cut out his rocket motors to save them as much as possible.  We had drawn terrifically on their fuel reserves in our battle with the  elements. For the moment, the atmosphere below cleared, and we could see  the Jersey coast far beneath, like a great map.    \"We're not through yet,\" remarked Gibbons suddenly, pointing at his  periscope, and adjusting it to telescopic focus. \"A Han ship, and a  'drop ship' at that--and he's seen us. If he whips that beam of his on  us, we're done.\"    I gazed, fascinated, at the viewplate. What I saw was a cigar-shaped  ship not dissimilar to our own in design, and from the proportional size  of its ports, of about the same size as our swoopers. We learned later  that they carried crews, for the most part of not more than three or  four men. They had streamline hulls and tails that embodied  universal-jointed double fish-tail rudders. In operation they rose to  great heights on their powerful repellor rays, then gathered speed  either by a straight nose dive, or an inclined dive in which they  sometimes used the repellor ray slanted at a sharp angle. He was already  above us, though several miles to the north. He could, of course, try to  get on our tail and \"spear\" us with his beam as he dropped at us from a  great height.    Suddenly his beam blazed forth in a blinding flash, whipping downward  slowly to our right. He went through a peculiar corkscrew-like  evolution, evidently maneuvering to bring his beam to bear on us with a  spiral motion.    Gibbons instantly sent our ship into a series of evolutions that must  have looked like those of a frightened hen. Alternately, he used the  forward and the reverse rocket blasts, and in varying degree. We  fluttered, we shot suddenly to right and left, and dropped like a  plummet in uncertain movements. But all the time the Han scout dropped  toward us, determinedly whipping the air around us with his beam. Once  it sliced across beneath us, not more than a hundred feet, and we  dropped with a jar into the pocket formed by the destruction of the air.    He had dropped to within a mile of us, and was coming with the speed of  a projectile, when the end came. Gibbons always swore it was sheer luck.  Maybe it was, but I like pilots who are lucky that way.    In the midst of a dizzy, fluttering maneuver of our own, with the Han  ship enlarging to our gaze with terrifying rapidity, and its beam slowly  slicing toward us in what looked like certain destruction within the  second, I saw Gibbons' fingers flick at the lever of his rocket gun and  a split second later the Han ship flew apart like a clay pigeon.    We staggered, and fluttered crazily for several moments while Gibbons  struggled to bring our ship into balance, and a section of about four  square feet in the side of the ship near the stern slowly crumbled like  rusted metal. His beam actually had touched us, but our explosive rocket  had got him a"]]]
