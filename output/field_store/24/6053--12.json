(This spreads out the vaseline into a thin layer, and  besides ensuring the adhesion of the cover-slip, seals the cells and so  retards evaporation.)    7. Examine microscopically.    The examination of a \"fresh\" specimen or a \"hanging-drop\" preparation is  directed to the determination of the following data:    1. The nature of the bacteria present--e. g., cocci, bacilli, etc.    2. The purity of the cultivation; this can only be determined when gross  morphological differences exist between the organisms present.    3. The presence or absence of spores; when present, spores show their  typical refrangibility exceedingly well by this method.    4. The presence or absence of mobility. In a hanging-drop specimen some  form of movement can practically always be observed, and its character  must be carefully determined by noting the relative positions of  adjacent micro-organisms.    (a) Brownian or molecular movement. Minute particles of solid matter  (including bacteria), when suspended in a fluid, will always show a  vibratory movement affecting the entire field, but never altering the  relative positions of the bacteria. (Cocci exhibit this movement, but  with the exception of the Micrococcus agilis, the cocci are non-motile.)    (b) Streaming movement. This is due to currents set up in the hanging  drop as a result of jarring of the specimen or of evaporation, or to the  fact that the cover-slip is not perfectly level, and although the  relative positions of the bacteria may vary, still the flowing movement  of large numbers of organisms in some one direction will usually be  sufficient to demonstrate the nature of this motion.    (c) Locomotive movement, or ~true motility~, is determined by observing  some one particular bacillus changing its position in the field  independently of, and in a direction contrary to, other organisms  present.    When the examination is completed and the specimen finished with, the  \"fresh specimen\"--i. e., the slide with the cover-slip attached--must  be dropped into the lysol pot. In the hanging-drop specimen, however,  the cover-slip only is infected, and this may be raised from the ring  cell by means of forceps and dropped into the disinfectant.    _Permanent Staining of the Hanging-drop Specimen._--Occasionally it is  necessary to fix and stain a hanging-drop preparation. This may be done  as follows:    1. Remove the cover-slip from the cell by the aid of the forceps.    2. If the drop is small, fix it by dropping it face downward, whilst  still wet, on to the surface of some Gulland's solution or corrosive  sublimate solution (_vide_ page 82) in a watch-glass. If the drop is  large, place it face upward on the rubber mat, cover it with an inverted  watch-glass, and allow it to dry. Then fix it in the alcohol and ether  solution (_vide_, page 82).    3. Dip the cover-glass into a beaker containing hot water in order to  remove some of the vaseline adhering to it.    4. Wash successively in alcohol, xylol, ether, and alcohol, to remove  the last traces of grease.    5. Wash in water.    6. Stain, wash, dry, and mount as for an ordinary cover-slip film  preparation (_vide_ pages 83-85).    ~2. Killed, Stained.~--In this method three distinct processes are  necessary:        \"Preparing\" and \"fixing\" the film.      Staining.      Mounting.    _Preparing the Film._--    1. Flame a cover-slip and place it on a piece of filter paper.    2. Place a drop of water on the centre of the cover-slip by means of  platinum loop.    3. Obtain a small quantity of the material to be examined upon a  sterilised platinum loop (see pages 74-76, steps 2 to 11) and mix it  with the drops of water on the cover-slip.    4. Spread the drop of emulsion evenly over the cover-slip in the form of  a square film to within 1 mm. of each edge of the cover-slip.    5. Allow it to dry completely in the air.    _Fixing._--Fix by passing the cover-slip, held in the fingers, three or  four times through the flame of a Bunsen burner.    In some instances (e. g., when the films after staining are intended  for micrometric observations) it is almost essential to fix by exposure  to a uniform temperature of 115 deg. C., for twenty minutes. This is best  done in a carefully regulated hot-air oven.    Fixation may also be effected by immersing in some fixative fluid, such  as one of the following:    1. Absolute alcohol, for five to fifteen minutes.                             { equal parts, for five to thirty      2. Absolute alcohol, { minutes (e. g., for blood or      Ether,               { milk).    3. Osmic acid, 1 per cent. aqueous solution, for thirty seconds.    4. Corrosive sublimate, saturated aqueous solution, for five minutes.    5. Corrosive sublimate (Lang), for five minutes. This solution is  prepared by dissolving:          Sodium chloride           0.75 gramme        Hydrarg. perchloride     12.00 grammes        Acetic acid               5.00 grammes        In distilled water      100.00 c.c.      Filter.    6. Gulland's solution, for five minutes. This solution is prepared by  mixing:        Absolute alcohol                                            25.0 c.c.      Ether                                                       25.0 c.c.      Corrosive sublimate, 20 per cent. alcoholic solution         0.4 c.c.    7. Formalin 10 per cent. aqueous solution (= 4 per cent. aqueous  solution of formaldehyde since formalin is a 40 per cent. solution of  the gas in water).    Either of these methods of fixation coagulates the albuminous material  and ensures perfect adhesion of the film to the cover-slip.    _Clearing._--Wash the cover-slip thoroughly in running water and proceed  with the staining.    If the film has been prepared from broth, liquefied gelatine, or pus or  other morbid exudations, saturate the film after fixation with acetic  acid 2 per cent. and allow it to act for two minutes.    Wash with alcohol, then let the alcohol remain on the cover-slip for two  minutes. (This will \"clear\" the groundwork and give a much sharper and  cleaner film than would otherwise be obtained.)    If the film has been prepared from blood or bloodstained fluid, treat  with acetic acid 2 per cent. for two minutes after fixation. Wash with  water, dry, and proceed with the staining. (This will remove the  haemoglobin and facilitate examination.)    _Staining._--    1. Rest the cover-slip, film side uppermost, on the rubber mat.    2. By means of a drop-bottle, cover the film side of the cover-slip with  the selected stain, allow it to act for a few minutes, then wash off the  excess in running water.    The penetrating power of stains is increased by (a) physical  means--e. g., heating the stain; (b) chemical means--e. g., by the  addition of carbolic acid, 5 per cent. aqueous solution; caustic  alkalies, 2 per cent. aqueous solutions; water saturated with aniline  oil; borax, 0.5 per cent. aqueous solution.    The most commonly used dyes for cover-slip film preparations are the  aniline dyes.        (A) Basic:        (a) Methylene-blue.        (b) Gentian violet.        (c) Fuchsin.    These dyes are kept in saturated alcoholic (90 per cent.) solutions so  that decomposition may be retarded.    Two or three drops of alcoholic solution of these dyes to, say, 4 c.c.  water, usually makes a sufficiently strong staining fluid for cover-slip  film preparations.    Carbolic methylene-blue (C.M.B.) and carbol fuchsin (C.F.) are prepared  by covering the cover-slip with 5 per cent. solution of carbolic acid  and adding a few drops of the saturated alcoholic solution of  methylene-blue or fuchsin respectively to it. For aniline gentian violet  (A.G.V.) the stain is added to a saturated solution of aniline oil in  water.          (d) Thionine blue.        (e) Bismarck brown.        (f) Neutral red.      (B) Acid:        (a) Eosin, aqueous yellowish.        (b) Safranine.    These dyes are kept in 1 per cent. aqueous solution to which is added 5  per cent. of alcohol, as a preservative. They are generally used in this  form.    A few nuclear stains (carmine, haematoxylin) are occasionally used more  especially in \"section\" work.    _Decolourisation._--After overstaining, films may be decolourised by  washing for a longer or shorter time in one of the following reagents  arranged in ascending order of power    1. Water.  2. Chloroform.  3. Acetic acid, 1 per cent.  4. Alcohol.  5. Alcohol absolute,         }   equal parts.

Blot off the superfluous water with the filter paper, or dry more  completely between two folds of blotting paper.    3. Complete the drying in the air, or by holding the cover-slip in the  fingers at a safe distance above the flame of the Bunsen burner.    4. Place a drop of xylol balsam on the centre of a clean 3 by 1 glass  slide and invert the cover-slip over the balsam, and lower it carefully  to avoid the inclusion of air bubbles.         NOTE.--Xylol is used in preference to chloroform to dissolve       Canada balsam, as it does not decolourise the specimen.    ~Impression films~ (_Klatschpraeparat_) are prepared from isolated  colonies of bacteria in order that their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27748"],[0,"Popular Lectures on Zoonomia (#13)"],[1,"the frequency of the pulse is about seventy  beats in a minute; and in an infant, within the first five or six  months, the pulse is seldom less than one hundred and twenty, and  diminishes in frequency as the child grows older. But though seventy  beats in the minute may be taken as a general standard; yet in  persons of irritable constitutions the frequency is greater than  this, and many, who are in the prime of life, have the pulse only  between fifty and sixty.    It is generally observed, that the pulse is slower in the morning,  that it increases in frequency till noon, after dinner it again  becomes slow, and in the evening its frequency returns, which  increases till midnight.    These phenomena may be rationally explained on the principles just  laid down. When we rise in the morning, the contractibility being  abundant, the stimulus of the blood produces a greater effect, the  pulse becomes slow, and the contractions strong; it becomes more  frequent, however, till dinner time, from a diminished  contractibility; after dinner, from the addition of the stimulus of  food and chyle, it again decreases in frequency, and becomes slow  till the evening, when its frequency returns, because the  contractibility becomes exhausted: and this frequency continues till  the vital power have been recruited by sleep.    By the same principles it is easy to explain the quickness of the  pulse in infancy, its gradual decrease till maturity, its slowness  and strength during the meridian of life, and the return of its  frequency during the decline.    Having now described the phenomena of the circulation, it will be  proper to examine the changes produced by this function on the blood;  and, in the first place, it may be observed, that the blood which  returns by the vena cava to the heart, is of a dark colour inclining  to purple; while that which passes from the left ventricle into the  arteries, is of a bright vermilion hue. The blood which is found in  the pulmonary artery has the same dark purple colour with that in the  vena cava, while that in the pulmonary vein resembles the aortal  blood in its brightness. Hence it would appear, that the blood,  during its passage through the lungs, has its colour changed from a  dark purple to a bright vermilion, in which state it is brought by  the pulmonary vein to the left auricle of the heart; this auricle,  contracting, expels the blood into the corresponding ventricle, by  whose action, and that of the arteries, it is distributed to all  parts of the body. When it returns, however, by the veins, it is  found to have lost its fine bright colour. It would appear,  therefore, that the blood obtains its red colour during its passage  through the lungs, and becomes deprived of it during its circulation  through the rest of the body.    That the blood contains iron, may be proved by various experiments:  if a quantity of blood be exposed to a red heat in a crucible, the  greatest part will be volatilised and burnt; but a quantity of brown  ashes will be left behind, which will be attracted by the magnet. If  diluted sulphuric acid be poured on these ashes, a considerable  portion of them will dissolve; if into this solution we drop tincture  of galls, a black precipitate will take place, or if we use prussiate  of potash, a precipitate of prussian blue will be formed. These facts  prove, beyond doubt, that a quantity of iron exists in the blood.    I shall not now particularly inquire how it comes there; it may  partly be taken into the blood along with the vegetable and animal  food, which is received into the stomach; for the greatest part of  the animal and vegetable substances, which we receive as food,  contain a greater or less quantity of iron. Or it may be partly  formed by the animal powers, as would appear from the following  circumstance. The analysis of an egg, before incubation, affords not  the least vestige of iron, but as soon as the chick exists, though it  has been perfectly shut up from all external communication, if the  egg be burnt, the ashes will be attracted by the magnet.    But, however we may suppose the blood to obtain its iron, it  certainly does contain it; if the coagulable lymph and serum of the  blood be carefully freed from the red particles, by repeated washing,  the strictest analysis will not discover in either of them a particle  of iron, while the red globules thus separated will be found to  contain a considerable quantity of this metal.    That the red colour of the blood depends upon iron, appears likewise  from the experiments of Menghini, which show, that the blood of  persons who have been taking chalybeate medicines for some time, is  much more florid that it is naturally; the same is agreeable to my  own observation. A late analysis, by Fourcroy, has likewise proved,  that the red colour of the blood resides in the iron; but, though the  red colour of the blood may reside in the iron which it contains, we  shall find that this colour is likewise connected with oxidation.    If the dark coloured blood, drawn from the veins, be put under a  vessel containing oxygen gas, its surface will immediately become  florid, while the bulk of the gas will be diminished. Mr. Hewson  enclosed a portion of a vein between two ligatures, and injected into  it a quantity of oxygen gas; the blood, which was before dark  coloured, instantly assumed the hue of arterial blood. Thuvenal put a  quantity of arterial blood under the receiver of an air pump; on  exhausting the air it became of the dark colour of venous blood; on  readmitting the air, it became again florid. He put it under a  receiver filled with oxygen gas, and found the florid colour much  increased.    Dr. Priestly exposed the blood of a sheep successively to oxygen gas,  atmospheric air, and carbonic acid gas; and found, that in oxygen gas  its colour became very florid, less so in atmospheric air, and in  carbonic acid gas it became quite black. He filled a bladder with  venous blood, and exposed it to oxygen gas; the surface in contact  with the bladder immediately became florid, while the interior parts  remained dark coloured.    All these facts prove, that the red colour which the blood acquires  in the lungs, is owing to the oxygen, which probably combines with  it, and the last mentioned fact shows, that oxygen will act on the  blood, even though a membrane similar to the bladder, be interposed  between them.    The same effect, probably, takes place in the lungs; the blood is  circulated through that organ by a number of fine capillary arteries;  and it is probable that the oxygen acts upon the blood through the  membranes of these arteries, in the same manner that it does through  the bladder.    In short, it seems likely, that the blood, during its circulation  through the lungs, becomes combined with oxygen; that this oxidated  blood, on its return to the heart, is circulated by the arteries to  all parts of the body; and that, during this circulation, its oxygen  combines with the hydrogen and carbon of the blood, and perhaps with  those parts of the body with which it comes into contact; it is  therefore brought back to the heart, by the veins, of a dark colour,  and deprived of the greatest part of its oxygen.    This is the most probable theory, in the present state of our  knowledge; it was proposed by Lavoisier, who imagines the focus of  heat, or fireplace to warm the body, to be in the lungs: others,  however, have thought it more consonant to facts, to suppose, that,  instead of the oxygen uniting with carbon and hydrogen in the lungs,  and there giving out its heat, the oxygen is absorbed by the blood,  and unites with these substances during the circulation, so that heat  is produced in every part of the body; and this doctrine seems  certainly supported by several facts and experiments.    The circulation of the blood, though so simple and beautiful a  function, was unknown to the ancient physicians, and was first  demonstrated by our countryman, Harvey; when he first published his  account of this discovery, he met with the treatment which is  generally experienced by those who enlighten and improve the comfort  of their fellow creatures, by valuable discoveries. The novelty and  merit of this discovery drew upon him the envy of most of his  contemporaries in Europe, who accordingly opposed him with all their  power; and some universities even went so far, as to refuse the  honours of medicine to those students, who had the audacity to defend  this doctrine; but afterwards, when they could not argue against  truth and conviction, they attempted to rob him of the discovery, and  asserted that many of the ancient physicians, and particularly  Hippocrates, were acquainted with it. Posterity, however, who can  alone review subjects of controversy without prejudice, have done  ample justice to his memory.    LECTURE IV.  DIGESTION, NUTRITION, &c.    The human body, by the various actions to which it is subject, and  the various functions which it performs, becomes, in a short time,  exhausted; the fluids become dissipated, the solids wasted, while  both are continually tending towards putrefaction. Notwithstanding  which, the body still continues to perform its proper functions,  often for a considerable length of time; some contrivance, therefore,  was necessary to guard against these accelerators of its destruction.  There are two ways in which the living body may be preserved; the one  by assimilating nutritious substances, to repair the loss of  different parts; the other to collect, in secretory organs, the  humours secreted from these substances.    We are admonished of the necessity of receiving substances into the  body, to repair the continual waste, by the appetites of hunger and  thirst. For the stomach being gradually emptied of its contents, and  the body, in some degree, exhausted by exercise, we experience a  disagreeable sensation in the region of "]]]
