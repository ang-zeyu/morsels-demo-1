He contented himself with  gratifying his daughter's fancies and indulging her in every way allowed  him by her system of training and education. The main marvel in the  result was that the girl did not grow more selfish, superficial, and  ignorant than she did. Something in her blood helped her, but more, it  was her aunt's touch upon her life. For every week a letter came from  the country manse, bringing with it some of the sweet simplicity of the  country and something like a breath of heaven.    She was nearing her fifteenth birthday, and though almost every letter  brought an invitation to visit the manse in the backwoods, it was only  when the girl's pale cheek and languid air awakened her father's anxiety  that she was allowed to accept the invitation to spend some weeks in the  country.                *         *         *         *         *    When Ranald and Hughie drove up to the manse on Saturday evening in the  jumper the whole household rushed forth to see them. They were worth  seeing. Burned black with the sun and the March winds, they would have  easily passed for young Indians. Hughie's clothes were a melancholy and  fluttering ruin; and while Ranald's stout homespun smock and trousers  had successfully defied the bush, his dark face and unkempt hair, his  rough dress and heavy shanty boots, made him appear, to Maimie's eyes,  an uncouth, if not pitiable, object.    \"Oh, mother!\" cried Hughie, throwing himself upon her, \"I'm home again,  and we've had a splendid time, and we made heaps of sugar, and I've  brought you a whole lot.\" He drew out of his pockets three or four cakes  of maple sugar. \"There is one for each,\" he said, handing them to his  mother.    \"Here, Hughie,\" she replied, \"speak to your cousin Maimie.\"    Hughie went up shyly to his cousin and offered a grimy hand. Maimie,  looking at the ragged little figure, could hardly hide her disgust as  she took the dirty, sticky little hand very gingerly in her fingers. But  Hughie was determined to do his duty to the full, even though Ranald was  present, and shaking his cousin's hand with great heartiness, he held up  his face to be kissed. He was much surprised, and not a little relieved,  when Maimie refused to notice his offer and turned to look at Ranald.    She found him scanning her with a straight, searching look, as if  seeking to discover of what sort she was. She felt he had noticed her  shrinking from Hughie, and was annoyed to find herself blushing under  his keen gaze. But when Mrs. Murray presented Ranald to her niece,  it was his turn to blush and feel awkward, as he came forward with a  triangular sort of movement and offered his hand, saying, with an access  of his Highland accent, \"It is a fine day, ma'am.\" It required all  Maimie's good manners to keep back the laugh that fluttered upon her  lips.    Slight as it was, Ranald noticed the smile, and turning from her  abruptly to Mrs. Murray, said: \"We were thinking that Friday would be a  good day for the sugaring-off, if that will do you.\"    \"Quite well, Ranald,\" said the minister's wife; \"and it is very good of  you to have us.\"    She, too, had noted Maimie's smile, and seeing the dark flush on  Ranald's cheek, she knew well what it meant.    \"Come and sit down a little, Ranald,\" she said, kindly; \"I have got some  books here for you and Don to read.\"    But Ranald would not sit, nor would he wait a moment. \"Thank you,  ma'am,\" he said, \"but I will need to be going.\"    \"Wait, Ranald, a moment,\" cried Mrs. Murray. She ran into the next  room, and in a few moments returned with two or three books and some  magazines. \"These,\" she said, handing him the books, \"are some of Walter  Scott's. They will be good for week-days; and these,\" giving him the  magazines, \"you can read after church on Sabbath.\"    The boy's eyes lighted up as he thanked Mrs. Murray, and he shook hands  with her very warmly. Then, with a bow to the company, and without  looking at Maimie again, he left the room, with Hughie following at his  heels. In a short time Hughie came back full of enthusiastic praise of  his hero.    \"Oh, mother!\" he cried, \"he is awful smart. He can just do anything.  He can make a splendid bed of balsam brush, and porridge, and pancakes,  and--and--and--everything.\"    \"A bed of balsam brush and porridge! What a wonderful boy he must be,  Hughie,\" said Maimie, teasing him. \"But isn't he just a little queer?\"    \"He's not a bit queer,\" said Hughie, stoutly. \"He is the best, best,  best boy in all the world.\"    \"Indeed! how extraordinary!\" said Maimie; \"you wouldn't think so to look  at him.\"    \"I think he is just splendid,\" said Hughie; \"don't you, mother?\"    \"Indeed, he is fery brown whatever,\" mocked Maimie, mimicking Ranald's  Highland tongue, a trick at which she was very clever, \"and--not just  fery clean.\"    \"You're just a mean, mean, red-headed snip!\" cried Hughie, in a rage,  \"and I don't like you one bit.\"    But Maimie was proud of her golden hair, so Hughie's shot fell harmless.    \"And when will you be going to the sugaring-off, Mistress Murray?\" went  on Maimie, mimicking Ranald so cleverly that in spite of herself Mrs.  Murray smiled.    It was his mother's smile that perfected Hughie's fury. Without a word  of threat or warning, he seized a dipper of water and threw it over  Maimie, soaking her pretty ribbons and collar, and was promptly sent  upstairs to repent.    \"Poor Hughie!\" said his mother, after he had disappeared; \"Ranald is his  hero, and he cannot bear any criticism of him.\"    \"He doesn't look much of a hero, auntie,\" said Maimie, drying her face  and curls.    \"Very few heroes do,\" said her aunt, quietly. \"Ranald has noble  qualities, but he has had very few advantages.\"    Then Mrs. Murray told her niece how Ranald had put himself between her  and the pursuing wolves. Maimie's blue eyes were wide with horror.    \"But, auntie,\" she cried, \"why in the world do you go to such places?\"    \"What places, Maimie?\" said the minister, who had come into the room.    \"Why, those awful places where the wolves are.\"    \"Indeed, you may ask why,\" said the minister, gravely. He had heard the  story from his wife the night before. \"But it would need a man to be on  guard day and night to keep your aunt from 'those places.'\"    \"Yes, and your uncle, too,\" said Mrs. Murray, shaking her head at her  husband. \"You see, Maimie, we live in 'those places'; and after all,  they are as safe as any. We are in good keeping.\"    \"And was Hughie out all night with those two boys in those woods,  auntie?\"    \"Oh, there was no danger. The wolves will not come near a fire, and the  boys have their dogs and guns,\" said Mrs. Murray; \"besides, Ranald is to  be trusted.\"    \"Trusted?\" said the minister; \"indeed, I would not trust him too far. He  is just wild enough, like his father before him.\"    \"Oh, papa, you don't know Ranald,\" said his wife, warmly; \"nor his  father either, for that matter. I never did till this last week. They  have kept aloof from everything, and really--\"    \"And whose fault is that?\" interrupted the minister. \"Why should they  keep aloof from the means of grace? They are a godless lot, that's what  they are.\" The minister's indignation was rising.    \"But, my dear,\" persisted Mrs. Murray, \"I believe if they had a  chance--\"    \"Chance!\" exclaimed the minister; \"what more chance do they want? Have  they not all that other people have? Macdonald Dubh is rarely seen at  the services on the Lord's day, and as for Ranald, he comes and goes at  his own sweet will.\"    \"Let us hope,\" said his wife, gently, \"they will improve. I believe  Ranald would come to Bible class were he not so shy.\"    \"Shy!\" laughed the minister, scornfully; \"he is not too shy to stand up  on the table before a hundred men after a logging and dance the Highland  fling, and beautifully he does it, too,\" he added.    \"But for all that,\" said his wife, \"he is very shy.\"    \"I don't like shy people,\" said Maimie; \"they are so awkward and  dreadful to do with.\"    \"Well,\" said her aunt, quietly, \"I rather like people who are not too  sure of themselves, and I think all the more of Ranald for his shyness  and modesty.\"    \"Oh, Ranald's modesty won't disable him,\" said the minister. \"For my  part, I think he is a daring young rascal; and indeed, if there is any  mischief going in the countryside you may be sure Ranald is not far  away.\"    \"Oh, papa, I don't think Ranald is a BAD boy,\" said his wife, almost  pleadingly.    \"Bad? I'm sure I don't know what you call it. Who let off the dam last  year so that the saw-mill could not run for a week? Who abused poor  Duncie MacBain so that he was carried home groaning?\"    \"Duncie MacBain!\" exclaimed his wife, contemptuously; \"great, big, soft  lump, that he is. Why, he's a man, as big as ever he'll be.\"    \"Who broke the Little Church windows till there wasn't a pane left?\"  pursued the minister, unheeding his wife's interruption.    \"It wasn't Ranald that broke the church windows, papa,\" piped Hughie  from above.    \"How do you know, sir? Who did it, then?\" demanded his father.    \"It wasn't Ranald, anyway,\" said Hughie, stoutly.    \"Who was it, then? Tell me that,\" said his father again.    \"Hughie, go to your room and stay there, as I told you,\" said his  mother, fearing an investigation into the window-breaking episode,  of which Hughie had made full confession to her as his own particular  achievement, in revenge for a broken window in the new church.    \"I think,\" continued Mr. Murray, as if closing the discussion, \"you'll  find that your Ranald is not the modest, shy, gentle young man you think  him to be, but a particularly bold young rascal.\"    \"Poor Ranald,\" sighed his wife; \"he has no mother, and his father has  just let him grow up wild.\"    \"Aye, that's true enough,\" assented her husband, passing into his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3289"],[0,"The Valley of Fear (#13)"],[1,"  \"I freely admit the difficulties,\" said Holmes. \"I propose to make a  little investigation of my own to-night, and it is just possible that it  may contribute something to the common cause.\"    \"Can we help you, Mr. Holmes?\"    \"No, no! Darkness and Dr. Watson's umbrella--my wants are simple. And  Ames, the faithful Ames, no doubt he will stretch a point for me. All my  lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic question--why  should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural an instrument  as a single dumb-bell?\"    It was late that night when Holmes returned from his solitary excursion.  We slept in a double-bedded room, which was the best that the little  country inn could do for us. I was already asleep when I was partly  awakened by his entrance.    \"Well, Holmes,\" I murmured, \"have you found anything out?\"    He stood beside me in silence, his candle in his hand. Then the tall,  lean figure inclined towards me. \"I say, Watson,\" he whispered, \"would  you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic, a man with  softening of the brain, an idiot whose mind has lost its grip?\"    \"Not in the least,\" I answered in astonishment.    \"Ah, that's lucky,\" he said, and not another word would he utter that  night.          Chapter 7--The Solution        Next morning, after breakfast, we found Inspector MacDonald and White  Mason seated in close consultation in the small parlour of the local  police sergeant. On the table in front of them were piled a number of  letters and telegrams, which they were carefully sorting and docketing.  Three had been placed on one side.    \"Still on the track of the elusive bicyclist?\" Holmes asked cheerfully.  \"What is the latest news of the ruffian?\"    MacDonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence.    \"He is at present reported from Leicester, Nottingham, Southampton,  Derby, East Ham, Richmond, and fourteen other places. In three of  them--East Ham, Leicester, and Liverpool--there is a clear case against  him, and he has actually been arrested. The country seems to be full of  the fugitives with yellow coats.\"    \"Dear me!\" said Holmes sympathetically. \"Now, Mr. Mac and you, Mr. White  Mason, I wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice. When I went  into this case with you I bargained, as you will no doubt remember, that  I should not present you with half-proved theories, but that I should  retain and work out my own ideas until I had satisfied myself that they  were correct. For this reason I am not at the present moment telling you  all that is in my mind. On the other hand, I said that I would play the  game fairly by you, and I do not think it is a fair game to allow you  for one unnecessary moment to waste your energies upon a profitless  task. Therefore I am here to advise you this morning, and my advice to  you is summed up in three words--abandon the case.\"    MacDonald and White Mason stared in amazement at their celebrated  colleague.    \"You consider it hopeless!\" cried the inspector.    \"I consider your case to be hopeless. I do not consider that it is  hopeless to arrive at the truth.\"    \"But this cyclist. He is not an invention. We have his description, his  valise, his bicycle. The fellow must be somewhere. Why should we not get  him?\"    \"Yes, yes, no doubt he is somewhere, and no doubt we shall get him; but  I would not have you waste your energies in East Ham or Liverpool. I am  sure that we can find some shorter cut to a result.\"    \"You are holding something back. It's hardly fair of you, Mr. Holmes.\"  The inspector was annoyed.    \"You know my methods of work, Mr. Mac. But I will hold it back for the  shortest time possible. I only wish to verify my details in one way,  which can very readily be done, and then I make my bow and return to  London, leaving my results entirely at your service. I owe you too much  to act otherwise; for in all my experience I cannot recall any more  singular and interesting study.\"    \"This is clean beyond me, Mr. Holmes. We saw you when we returned from  Tunbridge Wells last night, and you were in general agreement with our  results. What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea  of the case?\"    \"Well, since you ask me, I spent, as I told you that I would, some hours  last night at the Manor House.\"    \"Well, what happened?\"    \"Ah, I can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment.  By the way, I have been reading a short but clear and interesting  account of the old building, purchasable at the modest sum of one penny  from the local tobacconist.\"    Here Holmes drew a small tract, embellished with a rude engraving of the  ancient Manor House, from his waistcoat pocket.    \"It immensely adds to the zest of an investigation, my dear Mr. Mac,  when one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of  one's surroundings. Don't look so impatient; for I assure you that even  so bald an account as this raises some sort of picture of the past in  one's mind. Permit me to give you a sample. 'Erected in the fifth year  of the reign of James I, and standing upon the site of a much older  building, the Manor House of Birlstone presents one of the finest  surviving examples of the moated Jacobean residence--'\"    \"You are making fools of us, Mr. Holmes!\"    \"Tut, tut, Mr. Mac!--the first sign of temper I have detected in you.  Well, I won't read it verbatim, since you feel so strongly upon the  subject. But when I tell you that there is some account of the taking  of the place by a parliamentary colonel in 1644, of the concealment of  Charles for several days in the course of the Civil War, and finally  of a visit there by the second George, you will admit that there are  various associations of interest connected with this ancient house.\"    \"I don't doubt it, Mr. Holmes; but that is no business of ours.\"    \"Is it not? Is it not? Breadth of view, my dear Mr. Mac, is one of the  essentials of our profession. The interplay of ideas and the oblique  uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest. You will excuse  these remarks from one who, though a mere connoisseur of crime, is still  rather older and perhaps more experienced than yourself.\"    \"I'm the first to admit that,\" said the detective heartily. \"You get to  your point, I admit; but you have such a deuced round-the-corner way of  doing it.\"    \"Well, well, I'll drop past history and get down to present-day facts. I  called last night, as I have already said, at the Manor House. I did not  see either Barker or Mrs. Douglas. I saw no necessity to disturb them;  but I was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining and that  she had partaken of an excellent dinner. My visit was specially made  to the good Mr. Ames, with whom I exchanged some amiabilities, which  culminated in his allowing me, without reference to anyone else, to sit  alone for a time in the study.\"    \"What! With that?\" I ejaculated.    \"No, no, everything is now in order. You gave permission for that, Mr.  Mac, as I am informed. The room was in its normal state, and in it I  passed an instructive quarter of an hour.\"    \"What were you doing?\"    \"Well, not to make a mystery of so simple a matter, I was looking for  the missing dumb-bell. It has always bulked rather large in my estimate  of the case. I ended by finding it.\"    \"Where?\"    \"Ah, there we come to the edge of the unexplored. Let me go a little  further, a very little further, and I will promise that you shall share  everything that I know.\"    \"Well, we're bound to take you on your own terms,\" said the inspector;  \"but when it comes to telling us to abandon the case--why in the name of  goodness should we abandon the case?\"    \"For the simple reason, my dear Mr. Mac, that you have not got the first  idea what it is that you are investigating.\"    \"We are investigating the murder of Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone  Manor.\"    \"Yes, yes, so you are. But don't trouble to trace the mysterious  gentleman upon the bicycle. I assure you that it won't help you.\"    \"Then what do you suggest that we do?\"    \"I will tell you exactly what to do, if you will do it.\"    \"Well, I'm bound to say I've always found you had reason behind all your  queer ways. I'll do what you advise.\"    \"And you, Mr. White Mason?\"    The country detective looked helplessly from one to the other. Holmes  and his methods were new to him. \"Well, if it is good enough for the  inspector, it is good enough for me,\" he said at last.    \"Capital!\" said Holmes. \"Well, then, I should recommend a nice, cheery  country walk for both of you. They tell me that the views from Birlstone  Ridge over the Weald are very remarkable. No doubt lunch could be got at  some suitable hostelry; though my ignorance of the country prevents me  from recommending one. In the evening, tired but happy--\"    \"Man, this is getting past a joke!\" cried MacDonald, rising angrily from  his chair.    \"Well, well, spend the day as you like,\" said Holmes, patting him  cheerfully upon the shoulder. \"Do what you like and go where you will,  but meet me here before dusk without fail--without fail, Mr. Mac.\"    \"That sounds more like sanity.\"    \"All of it was excellent advice; but I don't insist, so long as you are  here when I need you. But now, before we part, I want you to write a  note to Mr. Barker.\"    \"Well?\"    \"I'll dictate it, if you like. Ready?    \"Dear Sir:    \"It has struck me that it is our duty to drain the moat, in the hope  that we may find some--\"    \"It's impossible,\" said the inspector. \"I've made inquiry.\"    \"Tut, tut! My dear sir, please do what I ask you.\"    \"Well, go on.\"    \"--in the hope that we may find something which may bear upon our  investigation. I have made arrangements, and the workmen will be at work  early to-morrow morning diverting the stream--\"    \"Impossible!\"    \"--diverting the stream; so I thought it best to explain matters  beforehand.    \"Now sign that, and send it by hand"]]]
