These are the moments, not only of the greatest  triumph, but of the greatest exultation for the artist. He who cannot  thus sway audiences will never rise above mediocrity.      DO NOT ATTEMPT THE IMPOSSIBLE    \"To those who are still in the preparatory stage of development I am  glad to give one word of advice. _Do not play pieces that are away  beyond your grasp._ This is the greatest fault in our American musical  educational systems of to-day. Pupils are permitted to play works that  are technically impossible for them to hope to execute without years of  preparation. What a huge blunder this is!    \"The pupil comes to the teacher, let us say, with the _Second Hungarian  Rhapsody_ of Liszt. It takes some fortitude for the conscientious  teacher to tell the pupil that she should work with the _C Major Sonata_  of Haydn instead. The pupil, with a kind of confidence that is, to say  the least, dangerous, imagines that the teacher is trying to keep her  back, and often goes to another teacher who will gratify her whim.    \"American girls think that they can do everything. Nothing is beyond  them. This is a country of great accomplishment, and they do not realize  that in music 'Art is long.' The virtuoso comes to a great metropolis  and plays a Moszkowski concerto of great difficulty. The next day the  music stores exhaust their stocks of this work, and a dozen misses, who  might with difficulty play a Mendelssohn _Song With Words_, are buried  in the avalanche of technical impossibilities that the alluring concerto  provides.      FOREIGN DEBUTS    \"Unfortunately, a foreign _debut_ seems to be necessary for the artist  who would court the favor of the American public. Foreign pianists get  engagements long before their managers in America ever hear them. In the  present state of affairs, if an American pianist were to have the  ability of three Liszts and three Rubinsteins in one person, he could  only hope for meager reward if he did not have a great European  reputation behind him.    \"The condition is absurd and regrettable, but nevertheless true. We have  many splendid teachers in America--as fine as there are in the world.    \"We have in our larger cities musical audiences whose judgment is as  discriminating as that of the best European audiences. Many an artist  with a great European reputation has come to this country, and, failing  'to make good' in the judgment of our critics and audiences, went back  with his reputation seriously impaired. Nevertheless, as I have stated,  the American artist without a European reputation, has no drawing power  and therefore does not interest the managers and the piano  manufacturers, who nowadays have largely supplanted the managers. This  being so, I can only advise the American artist to do as others had to  do. Go to Europe; give a few concerts in Berlin, London, Vienna or  Paris. Let the concert director who arranges your concerts paper the  house, but be sure you get a few critics in the audience. Have your  criticisms translated, and get them republished in American papers.  Then, if you have real merit, you may get a chance.    \"The interest in music in the United States at the present time is  phenomenal. European peoples have no conception of it. Nowhere in the  world can such interest be found. Audiences in different parts of the  country do not differ very greatly from the standpoint of intelligent  appreciation. When we consider the great uncultured masses of peasants  in Europe and the conditions of our own farmers, especially in the West,  there is no basis of comparison. America is already a musical country, a  very musical country. It is only in its failure to properly support  native musicians that we are subject to criticism.      PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS    \"To the young man or woman who would learn 'The Secret of Public  Appearance' I would say:    \"1. Look deeply into your natural qualifications. Use every morsel of  judgment you possess to endeavor to determine whether you are talented  or simply 'clever' at music. Court the advice of unbiased professional  musicians and meditate upon the difficulties leading to a successful  career, and do not decide to add one more musician to the world until  you are confident of your suitability for the work. Remember that this  moment of decision is a very important time and that you may be upon the  threshold of a dangerous mistake. Remember that there are thousands of  successful and happy teachers for one successful virtuoso.    \"2. After you have determined to undertake the career of the concert  performer let nothing stand in the way of study, except the  consideration of your health. Success with a broken-down body and a  shattered mind is a worthless conquest. Remember that if you wish a  permanent position you must be thoroughly trained in all branches of  your art.    \"3. Avoid charlatanism and the kind of advertisement that will bring you  notoriety at the sacrifice of your self-respect and the respect of your  best friends. Remember that real worth is, after all, the thing that  brings enduring fame.    \"4. Study the public. Seek to find out what pleases it, but never lower  the standards of your art. Read the best literature. Study pictures.  Travel. Broaden your mind. Acquire general culture.    \"5. Be careful of your stage deportment. Endeavor to do nothing at the  keyboard that will emphasize any personal eccentricity. Always be  sincere and true to your own nature, but within these limits try to make  a pleasing impression.    \"6. Always be your own severest critic. Be not easily satisfied with  yourself. Hitch your wagon to a star. Let your standard of perfection be  the very highest. Always strive to reach that standard. Never play in  public a piece that you have not thoroughly mastered. There is nothing  more valuable than public confidence. Once secured, it is the greatest  asset an artist can possess.    \"I have repeatedly been asked to give ten rules for practice.    \"It is not possible to formulate ten all-comprehensive rules that could  be applied in every case, but the following suggestions will be found  valuable to many students:    \"1. Concentrate during every second of your practice. To concentrate  means to bring all your thinking powers to bear upon one central point  with the greatest possible intensity. Without such concentration nothing  can be accomplished during the practice period. One hour of concentrated  thinking is worth weeks of thoughtless practice. It is safe to say that  years are being wasted by students in this country who fail to get the  most out of their practice because they do not know how to concentrate.  A famous thinker has said: 'The evidence of superior genius is the power  of intellectual concentration.'    \"2. Divide your practice time into periods of not more than two hours.  You will find it impossible to concentrate properly if you attempt to  practice more than two hours at a time. Do not have an arbitrary program  of practice work, for this course is liable to make your work  monotonous. For one who practices four hours (and that is enough for  almost any student), one hour for purely technical work, one hour for  Bach, and two hours for pieces is to be recommended.    \"3. In commencing your practice, play over your piece once or twice  before beginning to memorize. Then, after working through the entire  composition, pick out the more difficult passages for special attention  and reiteration.    \"4. Always practice slowly at first. This is simply another way of  telling the pupil to concentrate. Even after you have played your piece  at the required speed and with reasonable confidence that it is correct,  never fail to go back now and then and play it at the speed at which you  learned it. This is a practice which many virtuosos follow. Pieces that  they have played time and time again before enthusiastic audiences are  re-studied by playing them very slowly. This is the only real way to  undo mistakes that are bound to creep into one's performance when pieces  are constantly played in a rapid tempo.    \"5. Do not attempt to practice your whole piece at first. Take a small  section or even a phrase. If you take a longer section than say sixteen  bars, you will find it difficult to avoid mistakes. Of course, when the  piece is mastered you should have all these sections so unified that you  can play the entire composition smoothly and without a break.    \"6. First memorize _mentally_ the section you have selected for study,  and then practice it. If you do not know it well enough to practice it  from memory, you have not grasped its musical content, but are playing  mechanically.    \"7. Occasionally memorize backwards, that is, take the last few measures  and learn them thoroughly, then take the preceding measures and  continue in this way until the whole is mastered. Even after you have  played the piece many times, this process often compels a concentration  that is beneficial.    \"8. When studying, remember that practice is simply a means of  cultivating habits. If you play correctly from the start you will form  good habits; if you play carelessly and faultily your playing will grow  continually worse. Consequently, play so slowly and correctly from the  start that you may insure the right fingering, phrasing, tone, touch  (staccato, legato, portamento, etc.), pedaling and dynamic effects. If  you postpone the attainment of any of these qualities to a later date  they are much more difficult to acquire.    \"9. Always listen while you are playing. Music is intended to be heard.  If you do not listen to your own playing it is very probable that other  people will not care to listen to it either.    \"10. Never attempt to play anything in public that you have just  finished studying.

During the four weeks before  election she spoke twenty times, everywhere to crowded, enthusiastic  audiences. Her march through the State was a succession of triumphs,  and ended in a Republican victory.    The member in the first district having no faith that a woman could  influence politics, sent word to the Secretary, \"Don't send that damn  woman down here to defeat my election.\" The Secretary replied, \"We  have work enough for her to do in other districts without interfering  with you.\" But when the would-be honorable gentleman saw the furor she  created, he changed his mind, and inundated the Secretary with letters  to have her sent there. But the Secretary replied, \"It is too late;  the programme is arranged and published throughout the State; you  would not have her when you could, and now you can not have her when  you will.\"    It is pleasant to record that this man, who had the moral hardihood to  send a profane adjective over the wires, with the name of this noble  girl, lost his election. While all other districts went strongly  Republican, his was lost by a large majority. When the news came that  the Republicans had carried the State, due credit was awarded to Anna  Dickinson. The Governor-elect made personal acknowledgment that her  eloquent speeches had secured his election. She was serenaded,  feasted, and feted, the recipient of many valuable presents, and  eulogized by the press and the people.    New Hampshire safe, all eyes were now turned to Connecticut. The  contest there was between Seymour and Buckingham. It was generally  conceded that, if Seymour was elected, Connecticut would give no more  money or troops for the war. The Republicans were completely  disheartened. They said nothing could prevent the Democrats from  carrying the State by four thousand, while the Democrats boasted that  they would carry it by ten thousand. Though the issue was one of such  vital importance, there seemed so little hope of success, that the  Republicans were disposed to give it up without making an effort. And  no resistance to this impending calamity was made until Anna Dickinson  went into the State, and galvanized the desponding loyalists to life.  She spent two weeks there, and completely turned the tide of popular  sentiment. Democrats, in spite of the scurrilous attacks made on her  by some of their leaders and editors, received her everywhere with the  warmest welcome, tore off their party badges, substituted her  likeness, and applauded whatever she said. The halls where she spoke  were so densely packed, that Republicans stayed away to make room for  the Democrats, and the women were shut out to give place to those who  could vote. There never was such enthusiasm over an orator in this  country. The period of her advent, the excited condition of the  people, her youth, beauty, and remarkable voice, and wonderful  magnetic power, all heightened the effect of her genius, and helped to  produce this result. Her name was on every lip; ministers preached  about her, prayed for her, as a second Joan of Arc, raised up by God  to save that State to the loyal party, and through it the nation to  freedom and humanity. As the election approached, the excitement was  intense; and when at last it was announced that the State was saved by  a few hundred votes, the joy and gratitude of the crowds knew no  bounds. They shouted and hurrahed for Anna Dickinson, serenaded her  with full bands of music, sent her books, flowers, and ornaments,  manifesting in every way their love and loyalty to this gifted girl,  who through so many years had bravely struggled with poverty to this  proud moment of success in her country's cause. Some leading gentlemen  of the State who had invited her there presented her a gold watch and  chain, a hundred dollars for every night she had spoken, and four  hundred for the last night before election, in Hartford. The comments  of the press, though most flattering, give the reader but a faint idea  of the enthusiasm of the people.[33]    Fresh from the victories in New Hampshire and Connecticut, she was  announced to speak in Cooper Institute, New York. That meeting, in  May, 1862, was the most splendid ovation to a woman's genius since  Fanny Kemble, in all the wealth of her youth, beauty, and wonderful  dramatic power, appeared on the American stage for the first time.  There never was such excitement over any meeting in New York; hundreds  went away unable even to get standing places in the lobbies and outer  halls. The platform was graced with the most distinguished men and  women in the country, and so crowded that the young orator had scarce  room to stand. There were clergymen, generals, admirals, judges,  lawyers, editors, the literati, and leaders of fashion, and all alike  ready to do homage to this simple girl, who moved them alternately to  laughter and tears, to bursts of applause and the most profound  silence.    Henry Ward Beecher, who presided, introduced the speaker in his  happiest manner. For nearly two hours she held that large audience  with intense interest and enthusiasm, and when she finished with a  beautiful peroration, the people seemed to take a long breath, as if  to find relief from the intensity of their emotions. Loud cries  followed for Mr. Beecher; but he arose, and with great feeling and  solemnity, said: \"Let no man open his lips here to-night; music is the  only fitting accompaniment to the eloquent utterances we have heard.\"  The Hutchinsons closed with one of their soul-stirring ballads, and  the audience slowly dispersed, singing the John Brown song with  thrilling effect, as they marched into the street.[34]    After her remarkable success in New York, the Philadelphia Union  League invited her to speak in that city. The invitation, signed by  leading Republicans, she readily accepted. Judge Wm. D. Kelley  presided, and a most appreciative audience greeted her. In this  address, reviewing the incidents of the war, she criticised General  McClellan as usual, with great severity. Some of his personal friends,  filled with indignation, left the house, while a derisive laugh  followed them to the door. The Philadelphia journals vied with each  other in their eulogiums of her grace, beauty, and eloquence. The  marked attention she has always received in her native city has been  most grateful to her, and honorable to her fellow-citizens.    In July, 1862, the first move was made to enlist colored troops in  Pennsylvania. A meeting was called for that purpose in Philadelphia.  Judge Kelley, Frederick Douglass, and Anna Dickinson were there, and  made strong appeals to the people of that State to grant to the  colored man the honor of bearing arms in defence of his country. The  effort was successful. A splendid regiment was raised, and the first  duty they discharged was to serenade the young orator, who had spoken  so eloquently for their race all through the war.    In September a field-day was announced at Camp William Penn. General  Pleasanton reviewed the troops. It was a brilliant and interesting  occasion, as many were about to leave for the seat of war. At the  close of the day when the people began to disperse it was noised round  that Miss Dickinson was there; a cry was heard at once on all sides,  \"A speech! a speech!\" The moon was just rising, mingling its pale rays  with those of the setting sun, and throwing a soft, mysterious light  over the whole scene. The troops gathered round with bristling  bayonets and flags flying, the band was hushed to silence, and when  all was still, mounted on a gun-wagon, with General Pleasanton and his  staff on one side, General Wagner and his staff on the other, this  brave girl addressed \"our boys in blue.\" She urged that justice and  equality might be secured to every citizen in the republic; that  slavery and war might end forever and peace be restored; that our  country might indeed be the land of the free and the home of the  brave.    As she stood there uttering words of warning and prophecy, it seemed  as if her lips had been touched with a live coal from the altar of  heaven. Her inspired words moved the hearts of our young soldiers to  deeds of daring, and gave fresh courage to those about her to bid  their loved ones go and die if need be for freedom and their country.  The hour, the mysterious light, the stillness, the novel surroundings,  the youth of the speaker, all gave a peculiar power to her words, and  made the scene one of the most thrilling and beautiful on the page of  history.    In January, 1864, she made her first address in Washington. Though she  now felt that her success as an orator was established, yet she  hesitated long before accepting this invitation.[35] To speak before  the President, Chief-Justice, Judges, Senators, Congressmen, Foreign  Diplomats, all the dignitaries and honorables of the Government was  one of the most trying ordeals in her experience. She had one of the  largest and most brilliant audiences ever assembled in the Capitol,  and was fully equal to the occasion. She made a profound impression,  and her speech was the topic of conversation for days afterward. At  the close of her address she was presented to many of the  distinguished ladies and gentlemen, and chief among them the  President. This was one of the grandest occasions of her life. She was  honored as no man ever had been before. The comments of the press[36]  must have been satisfactory to her highest ambition as well as to that  of her admiring countrywomen.    One of the most powerful and impressive appeals she ever made was in  the Convention of Southern Loyalists held in Philadelphia in  September, 1866. In this Convention there was a division of opinion  between the Border and the Gulf States. The latter wanted to  incorporate negro suffrage in their platform, as that was the only  means of"]]]
