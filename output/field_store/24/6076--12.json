God is light, but light is not God.    The other references to the sun in Scripture do not call for much  comment. Its apparent unchangeableness qualifies it for use as an  expression for eternal duration, as in the seventy-second, the Royal,  Psalm, \"They shall fear Thee as long as the sun and moon endure;\" and  again, \"His name shall endure for ever: His name shall be continued as  long as the sun.\" And again, in the eighty-ninth Psalm, it is said of  David: \"His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before  Me.\"    The daily course of the sun from beyond the eastern horizon to beyond  the western gives the widest expression for the compass of the whole  earth. \"The mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken, and called the  earth, from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.\" \"From  the rising of the sun, unto the going down of the same, the Lord's name  is to be praised.\" The sun's rays penetrate everywhere. \"His going forth  is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and  there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.\" Whilst in the Book of  Ecclesiastes, the melancholy words of the Preacher revert over and over  again to that which is done \"under the sun.\" \"What profit hath a man of  all his labour which he taketh under the sun?\"    It should be noted that this same Book of Ecclesiastes shows a much  clearer idea of the sun's daily apparent motion than was held by many of  the writers of antiquity. There is, of course, nowhere in Scripture any  mention of the rotation of the earth on its axis as the mechanical  explanation of the sun's daily apparent motion; any more than we should  refer to it ourselves to-day except when writing from a purely technical  point of view. As said already, the Hebrews had probably not discovered  this explanation, and would certainly have not gone out of their way to  mention it in any of their Scriptures if they had.    One passage of great beauty has sometimes been quoted as if it contained  a reference to the earth's rotation, but when carefully examined it is  seen to be dealing simply with the apparent motion of the sun in the  course of the year and of the day.         \"Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days;        And caused the dayspring to know his place;        That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,        That the wicked might be shaken out of it?        It is turned as clay to the seal;        And they stand as a garment.\"    The earth appears to be spoken of as being \"turned\" to the sun, the  dayspring; and this, we know, takes place, morning by morning, in  consequence of the diurnal rotation. But the last two lines are better  rendered in the Revised Version--         \"It is changed as clay under the seal;        And _all things_ stand forth as a garment.\"    The ancient seals were cylinders, rolled over the clay, which, formless  before, took upon it the desired relief as the seal passed over it. So a  garment, laid aside and folded up during the night, is shapeless, but  once again takes form when the wearer puts it on. And the earth,  formless in the darkness, gains shape and colour and relief with the  impress upon it of the morning light.    It is quite clear that the Hebrews did not suppose that it was a new sun  that came up from the east each morning, as did Xenophanes and the  Epicureans amongst the Greeks. It was the same sun throughout. Nor is  there any idea of his hiding himself behind a mysterious mountain during  the night. \"The sun,\" the Preacher tells us, \"ariseth and the sun goeth  down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.\" The Hebrew was quite  aware that the earth was unsupported in space, for he knew that the Lord  \"stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth  upon nothing.\" There was therefore nothing to hinder the sun passing  freely under the earth from west to east, and thus making his path, not  a mere march onward ending in his dissolution at sunset, but a complete  \"circuit,\" as noted by the writer of the nineteenth Psalm.    The fierceness of the sun's heat in Palestine rendered sun-stroke a  serious danger. The little son of the Shunammite was probably so smitten  as he watched his father at work with the reapers. So the promise is  given to God's people more than once: \"The sun shall not smite thee by  day.\" \"They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun  smite them.\" The martyrs who pass through the great tribulation \"shall  hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on  them, nor any heat.\"    There are fewer references in Scripture to the vivifying effects of  sunlight upon vegetation than we might have expected. The explanation is  possibly to be found in the terrible perversion men had made of the  benefits which came to them by means of this action of sunlight, by  using them as an excuse for plunging into all kinds of nature-worship.  Yet there are one or two allusions not without interest. As already  mentioned, \"the precious fruits brought forth by the sun\" were promised  to the tribe of Joseph, whilst the great modern discovery that nearly  every form of terrestrial energy is derived ultimately from the energy  of the sun's rays gives a most striking appropriateness to the imagery  made use of by St. James.         \"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and       cometh down from the Father of Lights, with Whom is no       variableness, neither shadow of turning.\"    God, that is to say, is the true Sun, the true Origin of all Lights, the  true bestower of every good and perfect gift. The word rendered  \"variableness,\" is a technical word, used by ourselves in modern English  as \"parallax,\" and employed in the Septuagint Version to denote the  revolutions of the heavenly bodies, described in the thirty-eighth  chapter of the book of Job, as \"the ordinances of the heavens.\" With the  natural sun, therefore, there is \"variableness,\" that is to say, real or  apparent change of place; there is none with God. Neither is there with  Him any darkness of eclipse; any \"shadow\" caused as in the case of the  material sun, by the \"turning\" of earth and moon in their orbits. The  knowledge of \"the alternations of the turning of the sun,\" described in  the Book of Wisdom as a feature of the learning of Solomon, was a  knowledge of the laws of this \"variableness\" and \"turning\"; especially  of the \"turning\" of its rising and setting points at the two solstices;  and St. James may well have had that passage in his mind when he wrote.  For Science deals with the knowledge of things that change, as they  change, and of their changes, but Faith with the knowledge of Him that  abideth for ever, and it is to this higher knowledge that St. James  wished to point his readers.    Science deals with the knowledge of things that change, as they change  and of their changes. The physical facts that we have learned in the  last years about that changeful body the sun are briefly these:--    Its core or inner nucleus is not accessible to observation, its nature  and constitution being a mere matter of inference. The \"photosphere\" is  a shell of incandescent cloud surrounding the nucleus, but the depth, or  thickness of this shell is quite unknown. The outer surface--which we  see--of the photosphere is certainly pretty sharply defined, though very  irregular, rising at points into whiter aggregations, called \"faculae,\"  and perhaps depressed at other places in the dark \"spots.\" Immediately  above the photosphere lies the \"reversing layer\" in which are found the  substances which give rise to the gaps in the sun's spectrum--the  Fraunhofer lines. Above the \"reversing layer\" lies the scarlet  \"chromosphere\" with \"prominences\" of various forms and dimensions rising  high above the solar surface; and over, and embracing all, is the  \"corona,\" with its mysterious petal-like forms and rod-like rays.    The great body of the sun is gaseous, though it is impossible for us to  conceive of the condition of the gaseous core, subjected, as it is, at  once to temperature and pressure both enormously great. Probably it is a  gas so viscous that it would resist motion as pitch or putty does. Nor  do we know much of the nature of either the sun-spots or the solar  corona. Both seem to be produced by causes which lie within the sun;  both undergo changes that are periodical and connected with each other.  They exercise some influence upon the earth's magnetism, but whether  this influence extends to terrestrial weather, to rainfall and storms,  is still a matter of controversy.    The sun itself is distant from the earth in the mean, about 92,885,000  miles, but this distance varies between January and June by 3,100,000  miles. The diameter of the sun is 866,400 miles, but perhaps this is  variable to the extent of some hundreds of miles. It would contain  1,305,000 times the bulk of the earth, but its mean density is but  one-quarter that of the earth. The force of gravity at its surface is  27-1/2 times that at the surface of the earth, and it rotates on its  axis in about 25 days. But the sun's surface does not appear to rotate  as a whole, so this time of rotating varies by as much as two days if we  consider a region on the sun's equator or at a distance from it of 45 deg..  The intensity of sunlight at the surface of the sun is about 190,000  times that of a candle-flame, and the effective temperature of the solar  surface is eight or ten thousand degrees centigrade.    Such are some of the facts about the sun that are received, or, as it  would be technically expressed, \"adopted\" to-day. Doubtless a very few  years will find them altered and rendered more accurate as observations  accumulate. In a few hundred years, knowledge of the constitution of the  sun may have so increased that these data and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28540"],[0,"Bibliomania; or Book-Madness (#13)"],[1,"his decease. In this wish the       Doctor was not singular. Many eminent collectors had       indulged it before him: and, to my knowledge, many modern       ones still indulge it. Accordingly on the death of Dr.       Askew, in 1774, appeared, in the ensuing year, a catalogue       of his books for sale, by Messrs. Baker and Leigh, under the       following title:         \"BIBLIOTHECA ASKEVIANA, sive Catalogus Librorum Rarissimorum       ANTONII ASKEW, M.D., quorum Auctio fiet apud S. Baker et G.       Leigh, in Vico dicto _York Street, Covent Garden_, Londini.       _Die Lunae_, 13 _Februarii_, MDCCLXXV, et in undeviginti       sequentes dies.\" A few copies were struck off on large       paper.         We are told by the compiler of the catalogue that it was       thought unnecessary to say much with respect to this Library       of the late Dr. Anthony Askew, as the Collector and       Collection were so well known in almost all parts of Europe.       Afterwards it is observed that \"The books in general are in       very fine condition, many of them bound in morocco, and       Russia leather, with gilt leaves.\" \"To give a particular       account,\" continues the Compiler, \"of the _many scarce       editions_ of books in this Catalogue would be almost       endless, therefore the _first editions_ of the Classics, and       some _extremely rare books_ are chiefly noticed. The       catalogue, without any doubt, contains the best, rarest, and       most valuable collection of GREEK and LATIN BOOKS that were       ever sold in England.\" This account is not overcharged. The       collection, in regard to Greek and Roman literature, was       _unique_ in its day.         The late worthy and learned Mr. M. CRACHERODE, whose library       now forms one of the most splendid acquisitions of the       British Museum, and whose _bequest_ of it will immortalize       his memory, was also among the \"Emptores literarii\" at this       renowned sale. He had enriched his collection with many       _Exemplar Askevianum_; and, in his latter days, used to       elevate his hands and eyes, and exclaim against the prices       _now_ offered for EDITIONES PRINCIPES!         The fact is, Dr. Askew's sale has been considered a sort of       _aera_ in bibliography. Since that period, rare and curious       books in Greek and Latin literature have been greedily       sought after, and obtained at most extravagant prices. It is       very well for a veteran in bibliography, as was Mr.       Cracherode, or as are Mr. Wodhull and Dr. Gosset, whose       collections were formed in the days of Gaignat, Askew, Duke       de la Valliere, and Lamoignon--it is very well for such       gentlemen to declaim against _modern prices_! But what is to       be done? Books grow scarcer every day, and the love of       literature, and of possessing rare and interesting works,       increases in an equal ratio. Hungry bibliographers meet, at       sales, with well furnished purses, and are resolved upon       sumptuous fare. Thus the hammer _vibrates_, after a bidding       of _Forty pounds_, where formerly it used regularly to       _fall_ at _Four_!         But we lose sight of Dr. Askew's _rare editions_, and _large       paper copies_. The following, gentle Reader, is but an       imperfect specimen!         No. 168.

The reader who has not seen them       can have no idea of the beauty of these vellum leaves. The       ink is of the finest lustre, and the whole typographical       arrangement may be considered a master-piece of printing.       Lord Oxford told Dr. Mead that he gave 100 guineas for this       very copy.]    After this melancholy event, one would have thought that future  _Virtuosi_ would have barricadoed their doors, and fumigated their  chambers, to keep out such a pest;--but how few are they who profit by  experience, even when dearly obtained! The subsequent history of the  disease is a striking proof of the truth of this remark; for the  madness of book-collecting rather increased--and the work of death  still went on. In the year 1776 died John Ratcliffe[47] another, and  a very singular, instance of the fatality of the BIBLIOMANIA. If he  had contented himself with his former occupation, and frequented the  butter and cheese, instead of the book, market--if he could have  _fancied himself_ in a brown peruke, and Russian apron, instead of an  embroidered waistcoat, velvet breeches, and flowing perriwig, he  might, perhaps, have enjoyed greater longevity; but, infatuated by the  Caxtons and Wynkyn De Wordes of Fletewode and of West, he fell into  the snare; and the more he struggled to disentangle himself, the more  certainly did he become a prey to the disease.

The       sale took place on March 27, 1776.         If ever there was a _unique_ collection, this was one--the       very essence of Old Divinity, Poetry, Romances, and       Chronicles!

If the present owner of it were disposed to part       with it, I could not find it in my heart to refuse him       _compound interest_ for his money. As is the wooden       frame-work to the bricklayer in the construction of his       arch, so might Mr. Ratcliffe's MS. Catalogues be to me in       the compilation of a certain _magnum opus_!         The memory of such a man ought to be dear to the       \"_black-lettered dogs_\" of the present day; for he had       [mirabile dictu!] _upwards of_ THIRTY CAXTONS!         If I might hazard a comparison between Mr. James West's and       Mr. John Ratcliffe's collections, I should say that the       former was more extensive, the latter more curious: Mr.       West's, like a magnificent _champagne_, executed by the hand       of Claude or Both, and enclosing mountains, and meadows, and       streams, presented to the eye of the beholder a scene at       once extensive, luxuriant, and fruitful: Mr. Ratcliffe's,       like one of those delicious pieces of scenery, touched by       the pencil of Rysdael or Hobbima, exhibited to the       beholder's eye a spot equally interesting, but less varied       and extensive. The sweeping foliage and rich pasture of the       former could not, perhaps, afford greater gratification than       did the thatched cottage, abrupt declivities, and gushing  "]]]
