If it therefore  is to act as one man, it ought to act by one uniform will. But,  inasmuch as political communities are made up of many natural persons,  each of whom has his particular will and inclination, these several  wills cannot by any _natural_ union be joined together, or tempered  and disposed into a lasting harmony, so as to constitute and produce  that one uniform will of the whole. It can therefore be no otherwise  produced than by a _political_ union; by the consent of all persons to  submit their own private wills to the will of one man, or of one or  more assemblies of men, to whom the supreme authority is entrusted:  and this will of that one man, or assemblage of men, is in different  states, according to their different constitutions, understood to be  _law_.    THUS far as to the _right_ of the supreme power to make laws; but  farther, it is it's _duty_ likewise. For since the respective members  are bound to conform themselves to the will of the state, it is  expedient that they receive directions from the state declaratory of  that it's will. But since it is impossible, in so great a multitude,  to give injunctions to every particular man, relative to each  particular action, therefore the state establishes general rules, for  the perpetual information and direction of all persons in all points,  whether of positive or negative duty. And this, in order that every  man may know what to look upon as his own, what as another's; what  absolute and what relative duties are required at his hands; what is  to be esteemed honest, dishonest, or indifferent; what degree every  man retains of his natural liberty; what he has given up as the price  of the benefits of society; and after what manner each person is to  moderate the use and exercise of those rights which the state assigns  him, in order to promote and secure the public tranquillity.    FROM what has been advanced, the truth of the former branch of our  definition, is (I trust) sufficiently evident; that \"_municipal law is  a rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state_.\"  I proceed now to the latter branch of it; that it is a rule so  prescribed, \"_commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is  wrong_.\"    NOW in order to do this completely, it is first of all necessary that  the boundaries of right and wrong be established and ascertained by  law. And when this is once done, it will follow of course that it is  likewise the business of the law, considered as a rule of civil  conduct, to enforce these rights and to restrain or redress these  wrongs. It remains therefore only to consider in what manner the law  is said to ascertain the boundaries of right and wrong; and the  methods which it takes to command the one and prohibit the other.    FOR this purpose every law may be said to consist of several parts:  one, _declaratory_; whereby the rights to be observed, and the wrongs  to be eschewed, are clearly defined and laid down: another,  _directory_, whereby the subject is instructed and enjoined to observe  those rights, and to abstain from the commission of those wrongs: a  third, _remedial_; whereby a method is pointed out to recover a man's  private rights, or redress his private wrongs: to which may be added a  fourth, usually termed the _sanction_, or _vindicatory_ branch of the  law; whereby it is signified what evil or penalty shall be incurred by  such as commit any public wrongs, and transgress or neglect their  duty.    WITH regard to the first of these, the _declaratory_ part of the  municipal law, this depends not so much upon the law of revelation or  of nature, as upon the wisdom and will of the legislator. This  doctrine, which before was slightly touched, deserves a more  particular explication. Those rights then which God and nature have  established, and are therefore called natural rights, such as are life  and liberty, need not the aid of human laws to be more effectually  invested in every man than they are; neither do they receive any  additional strength when declared by the municipal laws to be  inviolable. On the contrary, no human legislature has power to abridge  or destroy them, unless the owner shall himself commit some act that  amounts to a forfeiture. Neither do divine or natural _duties_ (such  as, for instance, the worship of God, the maintenance of children, and  the like) receive any stronger sanction from being also declared to be  duties by the law of the land. The case is the same as to crimes and  misdemesnors, that are forbidden by the superior laws, and therefore  stiled _mala in se_, such as murder, theft, and perjury; which  contract no additional turpitude from being declared unlawful by the  inferior legislature. For that legislature in all these cases acts  only, as was before observed, in subordination to the great lawgiver,  transcribing and publishing his precepts. So that, upon the whole, the  declaratory part of the municipal law has no force or operation at  all, with regard to actions that are naturally and intrinsically right  or wrong.    BUT with regard to things in themselves indifferent, the case is  entirely altered. These become either right or wrong, just or unjust,  duties or misdemesnors, according as the municipal legislator sees  proper, for promoting the welfare of the society, and more effectually  carrying on the purposes of civil life. Thus our own common law has  declared, that the goods of the wife do instantly upon marriage become  the property and right of the husband; and our statute law has  declared all monopolies a public offence: yet that right, and this  offence, have no foundation in nature; but are merely created by the  law, for the purposes of civil society. And sometimes, where the thing  itself has it's rise from the law of nature, the particular  circumstances and mode of doing it become right or wrong, as the laws  of the land shall direct. Thus, for instance, in civil duties;  obedience to superiors is the doctrine of revealed as well as natural  religion: but who those superiors shall be, and in what circumstances,  or to what degrees they shall be obeyed, is the province of human laws  to determine. And so, as to injuries or crimes, it must be left to our  own legislature to decide, in what cases the seising another's cattle  shall amount to the crime of robbery; and where it shall be a  justifiable action, as when a landlord takes them by way of distress  for rent.    THUS much for the _declaratory_ part of the municipal law: and the  _directory_ stands much upon the same footing; for this virtually  includes the former, the declaration being usually collected from the  direction. The law that says, \"thou shalt not steal,\" implies a  declaration that stealing is a crime. And we have seen that, in things  naturally indifferent, the very essence of right and wrong depends  upon the direction of the laws to do or to omit it.    THE _remedial_ part of a law is so necessary a consequence of the  former two, that laws must be very vague and imperfect without it. For  in vain would rights be declared, in vain directed to be observed, if  there were no method of recovering and asserting those rights, when  wrongfully withheld or invaded. This is what we mean properly, when we  speak of the protection of the law. When, for instance, the  _declaratory_ part of the law has said \"that the field or inheritance,  which belonged to Titius's father, is vested by his death in Titius;\"  and the _directory_ part has \"forbidden any one to enter on another's  property without the leave of the owner;\" if Gaius after this will  presume to take possession of the land, the _remedial_ part of the law  will then interpose it's office; will make Gaius restore the  possession to Titius, and also pay him damages for the invasion.    WITH regard to the _sanction_ of laws, or the evil that may attend the  breach of public duties; it is observed, that human legislators have  for the most part chosen to make the sanction of their laws rather  _vindicatory_ than _remuneratory_, or to consist rather in  punishments, than in actual particular rewards. Because, in the first  place, the quiet enjoyment and protection of all our civil rights and  liberties, which are the sure and general consequence of obedience to  the municipal law, are in themselves the best and most valuable of all  rewards. Because also, were the exercise of every virtue to be  enforced by the proposal of particular rewards, it were impossible for  any state to furnish stock enough for so profuse a bounty. And  farther, because the dread of evil is a much more forcible principle  of human actions than the prospect of good[i]. For which reasons,  though a prudent bestowing of rewards is sometimes of exquisite use,  yet we find that those civil laws, which enforce and enjoin our duty,  do seldom, if ever, propose any privilege or gift to such as obey the  law; but do constantly come armed with a penalty denounced against  transgressors, either expressly defining the nature and quantity of  the punishment, or else leaving it to the discretion of the judges,  and those who are entrusted with the care of putting the laws in  execution.    [Footnote i: Locke, Hum. Und. b. 2. c. 21.]    OF all the parts of a law the most effectual is the _vindicatory_. For  it is but lost labour to say, \"do this, or avoid that,\" unless we also  declare, \"this shall be the consequence of your noncompliance.\" We  must therefore observe, that the main strength and force of a law  consists in the penalty annexed to it. Herein is to be found the  principal obligation of human laws.    LEGISLATORS and their laws are said to _compel_ and _oblige_; not that  by any natural violence they so constrain a man, as to render it  impossible for him to act otherwise than as they direct, which is the  strict sense of obligation: but because, by declaring and exhibiting a  penalty against"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30850"],[0,"Philippine Mats (#13)"],[1,"appearance  and average about 4 mm. in diameter. The stems may have long leaves  at the base or may be entirely leafless, and are usually four- or  five-sided immediately under the inflorescence. The general appearance  of the stalk is round. The plant has few or no underground root-like  stems. The flowers are densely clustered together to form spikelets,  dusky brown in color, measuring 6 mm. by 3 mm. In the Visayas it is  generally known as tikug. In Agusan and Surigao it is called \"anahiwan\"  and in Bukidnon \"sudsud\". Sometimes it is called tayoc-tayoc in  confusion with the smaller sedge more properly known by that name,  which much resembles tikug. A specimen from Pampanga was labeled  \"muta\".    Tikug grows in greatest profusion and reaches its highest economic  importance in parts of Mindanao, Bohol, Leyte, and Samar. To a less  degree, it is found and utilized on Negros and Panay. While it is  found in Cebu, it is not used there. As a recognized industrial  plant, therefore, its distribution is confined to the Visayas and  Mindanao. Its appearance in Pampanga would indicate that it may be  found in other regions in which its value in hand-weaving and in the  making of matting is not understood. [25]    Tikug is utilized in making hats, mats, matting, slippers and various  minor articles.        Samar Mats.      Gathering the Straw.    The best known tikug mats are produced on the Island of Samar,  where the sedge grows wild. [26] It has never been cultivated  there. Different grades are recognized in the height and width of the  straw. The finest is 1 1/2 mm. in diameter while the largest straws  are fully four times that width. Full grown stalks sometimes reach 3  meters in height, but the average is 1 1/2 meters. In most places in  Samar only very coarse tikug is found and this is especially true in  the northern half of the island. The best material grows near the towns  of Basey and Sulat, a circumstance probably due to the fact that most  of these sedges are pulled up for weaving before they become old and  coarse, for it is in these two towns that the mat industry of Samar is  centered. All grades of tikug can be used in making mats; but as the  straw cannot be split into finer pieces, it is only from the narrower  material that the fine mats are made. The map on the distribution of  tikug shows the regions in Samar in which this sedge occurs. [27]        Bleaching.    In some parts of Samar rough mats are made from tikug dried in the  shade. In Basey and Sulat bleached straw is used. In the bleaching  process only the sun is used, the bundles being spread out where  there is neither grass nor shade. The straw must be kept perfectly  dry at all times, for if it becomes wet or damp it will mildew and  turn an unsightly black or brown. In the morning it must not be put  out until the ground is dry and in the evening it should be taken in  before dew is formed upon it. The best results are obtained by drying  the material in a place where there is no grass, as the turf generally  holds considerable moisture and retards the process. With proper care  clean white straw can be obtained in about one week under the most  favorable conditions. Sometimes, but not often, the above process  is preceded by boiling the straw for ten or twenty minutes in plain  water. Several bleaching experiments have already been made with tikug,  but as yet none has been entirely successful. In one experiment straw  was boiled in alum, but the resultant material was not so white as  that obtained by simply drying it in the sun. Boiling green tikug in  water containing acetic acid from the juice of limes and lemons was  unsatisfactory. The best straw obtained was that produced by simply  boiling the green stalk for a few minutes in water and rinsing it  well and then drying in the sunshine for several days.    The straws are of different lengths and diameters; after bleaching  they must be sorted. The seed clusters are removed and the bunches  are tied in a big bundle which is laid on the floor with root toward  the worker. The longer straws of small diameter are then pulled out  and placed in small bundles, the process continuing until the several  different grades are thus separated and nothing remains but a few short  thick straws which are kept for embroidering designs. Each bundle  is then trimmed by cutting off the roots and ragged tops and the  straw is ready for storing, dyeing, or flattening. If tikug remains  in a damp place it will mold and become worthless. It is easily kept  during the dry season, if frequently exposed to the sun. During the  rainy season it should be wrapped in a blanket or cloth.        Dyeing.      Very few uncolored straws are used in Samar mats. The dyed material  is more durable and does not mildew as readily as the uncolored  straws. Tikug dyes easily and this is probably one of the reasons why  the mats of Samar have so much color. The cost of the dye in a Basey  mat is no small part of the total expense of production. Consequently  it is necessary to employ a cheap dye. For instance, one of the best  commercial dyes known in Manila was used with great success on Samar  mats, but the value of the coloring material consumed in making  them was greater than their selling price. The dye used in making  the cheapest of Samar mats costs the weavers about 10 centavos while  the more elaborate products need as much as 65 centavos worth of dye  to color them. A common mat containing 15 centavos worth of dyestuff  sells for about a peso. [28]    The colors obtained by the Basey mat weavers have a greater variety  of shades and tints than those produced by any other workers in the  Philippines on tikug or any other mat material. The shades and tints  depend upon two considerations: (1) The amount of dyestuffs used and  (2) the length of time the boiling process is continued. Four dyestuffs  are used. Yellows are obtained from turmeric; greens and reds are  obtained from coal-tar dyes; and a red-orange from deora. The leaves  of the latter plant are crushed and the pulpy mass thus obtained is  boiled to yield the dye fluid. By combining these four dye materials  in different proportions, by using varying amounts of the material,  and by boiling varying lengths of time, different colors, shades and  tints are obtained.    The method of dyeing is as follows: The bunches of tikug are coiled  and placed in a can of hot dye, where they are boiled from two to  ten minutes, or until the desired intensity has been secured. The  more the straw is boiled, the more nearly permanent will be the  color and the greater will be its intensity. Care must be taken to  see that the dye fluid is not too strong; otherwise the color will  be too intense. In order that the material may be evenly colored,  the tikug is submerged in the dye so that it is well covered and is  turned over several times during the process. After the coils are  removed they should be laid upon the ground or floor, allowed to cool,  and then hung in the shade to dry.        Flattening.    The straws composing the bleached or dyed bundles of material are  stiff and uneven; some are bent and others are round. The process of  flattening them and making them more pliable is carried on during  damp days, in the morning or evening, for if done in the open air  on cloudless days, or at any time when the atmosphere is dry, the  straw becomes brittle and breaks. However, climatic conditions may be  overcome by wrapping the straw in banana leaves or damp cloth for an  hour or more and then working it where no breeze can dry it out. No  water should be applied. The workers employ the usual blunt-edged,  ruler-like piece of wood; between this and the thumb the straw is  drawn by the free hand. This process flattens the straw and makes it  pliable so that it does not split during weaving.        The Weaving of Samar Mats.    Up to three years ago tikug was but little used in Samar except for  weaving mats. Commercially, mat weaving was confined to Sulat and  Basey. Since the American occupation it has been widely done and  the work has been introduced into most of the schools. Not only have  methods been greatly improved but new uses have been found for the  material. To-day the sedge is woven into floor and wall mats, hats,  table mats, slippers, book-bags, hand-bags, necktie cases, pencil  holders, pencil cases, and pillow and cushion covers. Recently the  weaving of matting on looms has been undertaken in the schools and a  fine product, similar to the matting of Japan, has been produced on  the ordinary loom adjusted to the straw.    The chief use of tikug in Samar is in the weaving of mats in the towns  of Basey and Sulat. Since time immemorial tikug mats have been woven in  Samar. At Palapag, Oras, Dolores, Taft, Balangiga, Santa Rita, Gandara,  Oquendo, and Catarman, a few rough ones, the product of unskilled  workmen, were made, but they were of no commercial importance, since  the people did not weave enough to supply their own demand. As far  back as can now be traced, the people of Basey and Sulat have been  making mats for the provincial and interprovincial trade. Since 1907  the people of Dolores, Oras, Santa Rita, and Balangiga have improved  in weaving and are now producing a few mats for the market. Their work  is much inferior to that of Basey and Sulat. In the year 1911 Basey  produced about 9,000 mats and Sulat about 300. The latter town could  have increased its production greatly, but its remoteness from the  market and from the routes of commerce reduces the large demand which  might otherwise exist for the mats. Basey is better situated in these  respects; moreover, the people have been forced to fall back on mat  weaving as their chief means of support, for typhoons have destroyed  their coconuts and abaca, and their rice crop is scant. Almost every  night mat weavers are found at work in many of the houses.    Several years ago, "]]]
