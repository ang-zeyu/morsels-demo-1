They have several times applied to us for artillery officers, and  we have sent them some; but the officers thus sent have not been  sufficiently powerful, either in numbers or talent, to produce any  important result.    General Bonaparte, who, from his youth, has served in the artillery, of  which he was entrusted with the command at the siege of Toulon, and in  the two campaigns of Italy, offers his services to proceed to Turkey,  with a mission from the (French) Government.    He proposes to take along with him six or seven officers, of different  kinds, and who may be, altogether, perfect masters of the military art.    He will have the satisfaction of being useful to his country in this new  career, if he succeed in rendering the Turkish power more formidable, by  completing the defence of their principal fortresses, and constructing  new ones.    This note shows the error of the often-repeated assertion, that he  proposed entering the service of the Turks against Austria. He makes no  mention of such a thing; and the two countries were not at war.         --[The Scottish biographer makes Bonaparte say that it would be     strange if a little Corsican should become King of Jerusalem. I     never heard anything drop from him which supports the probability of     such a remark, and certainly there is nothing in his note to warrant     the inference of his having made it.--Bourrienne.]--    No answer was returned to this note. Turkey remained unaided, and  Bonaparte unoccupied. I must confess that for the failure of this  project, at least I was not sorry. I should have regretted to see a  young man of great promise, and one for whom I cherished a sincere  friendship, devote himself to so uncertain a fate. Napoleon has less  than any man provoked the events which have favoured him; no one has  more yielded to circumstances from which he was so skilful to derive  advantages. If, however, a clerk of the War Office had but written on  the note, \"Granted,\" that little word would probably have changed the  fate of Europe.    Bonaparte remained in Paris, forming schemes for the gratification  of his ambition, and his desire of making a figure in the world; but  obstacles opposed all he attempted.    Women are better judges of character than men. Madame de Bourrienne,  knowing the intimacy which subsisted between us, preserved some notes  which she made upon Bonaparte, and the circumstances which struck her as  most remarkable, during her early connection with him. My wife did not  entertain so favourable an opinion of him as I did; the warm friendship  I cherished for him probably blinded me to his faults. I subjoin Madame  de Bourrienne's notes, word for word:    On the day after our second return from Germany, which was in May 1795,  we met Bonaparte in the Palais Royal, near a shop kept by a man named  Girardin. Bonaparte embraced Bourrienne as a friend whom he loved and  was glad to see. We went that evening to the Theatre Francais. The  performance consisted of a tragedy; and 'Le Sourd, ou l'Auberge pleine'.  During the latter piece the audience was convulsed with laughter. The  part of Dasnieres was represented by Batiste the younger, and it was  never played better. The bursts of laughter were so loud and frequent  that the actor was several times obliged to stop in the midst of his  part. Bonaparte alone (and it struck me as being very extraordinary) was  silent, and coldly insensible to the humour which was so irresistibly  diverting to everyone else. I remarked at this period that his character  was reserved, and frequently gloomy. His smile was hypocritical, and  often misplaced; and I recollect that a few days after our return  he gave us one of these specimens of savage hilarity which I greatly  disliked, and which prepossessed me against him. He was telling us  that, being before Toulon, where he commanded the artillery, one of his  officers was visited by his wife, to whom he had been but a short time  married, and whom he tenderly loved. A few days after, orders were  given for another attack upon the town, in which this officer was to be  engaged. His wife came to General Bonaparte, and with tears entreated  him to dispense with her husband's services that day. The General was  inexorable, as he himself told us, with a sort of savage exaltation. The  moment for the attack arrived, and the officer, though a very brave man,  as Bonaparte himself-assured us, felt a presentiment of his approaching  death. He turned pale and trembled. He was stationed beside the General,  and during an interval when the firing from the town was very heavy,  Bonaparte called out to him, \"Take care, there is a shell coming!\" The  officer, instead of moving to one side, stooped down, and was literally  severed in two. Bonaparte laughed loudly while he described the event  with horrible minuteness. At this time we saw him almost every day. He  frequently came to dine with us. As there was a scarcity of bread,  and sometimes only two ounces per head daily were distributed in the  section, it was customary to request one's guests to bring their own  bread, as it could not be procured for money. Bonaparte and his brother  Louis (a mild, agreeable young man, who was the General's aide de army)  used to bring with them their ration bread, which was black, and mixed  with bran. I was sorry to observe that all this bad bread fell to the  share of the poor aide de camp, for we provided the General with a finer  kind, which was made clandestinely by a pastrycook, from flour which we  contrived to smuggle from Sens, where my husband had some farms. Had we  been denounced, the affair might have cost us our heads.    We spent six weeks in Paris, and we went frequently with Bonaparte to  the theatres, and to the fine concerts given by Garat in the Rue St.  Marc. These were the first brilliant entertainments that took place  after the death of Robespierre. There was always something original in  Bonaparte's behaviour, for he often slipped away from us without saying  a word; and when we were supposing he had left the theatre, we would  suddenly discover him in the second or third tier, sitting alone in a  box, and looking rather sulky.    Before our departure for Sens, where my husband's family reside, and  which was fixed upon for the place of my first accouchement, we looked  out for more agreeable apartments than we had in the Rue Grenier St.  Lazare, which we only had temporarily. Bonaparte used to assist us in  our researches. At last we took the first floor of a handsome new house,  No. 19 Rue des Marais. Bonaparte, who wished to stop in Paris, went  to look at a house opposite to ours. He had thoughts of taking it for  himself, his uncle Fesch (afterwards Cardinal Fesch), and a gentleman  named Patrauld, formerly one of his masters at the Military School.  One day he said, \"With that house over there, my friends in it, and a  cabriolet, I shall be the happiest fellow in the world.\"    We soon after left town for Sens. The house was not taken by him, for  other and great affairs were preparing. During the interval between  our departure and the fatal day of Vendemiaire several letters passed  between him and his school companion. These letters were of the most  amiable and affectionate description. They have been stolen. On our  return, in November of the same year, everything was changed. The  college friend was now a great personage. He had got the command of  Paris in return for his share in the events of Vendemiaire. Instead of  a small house in the Rue des Marais, he occupied a splendid hotel in  the Rue des Capucines; the modest cabriolet was converted into a superb  equipage, and the man himself was no longer the same. But the friends of  his youth were still received when they made their morning calls.  They were invited to grand dejeuners, which were sometimes attended  by ladies; and, among others, by the beautiful Madame Tallien and her  friend the amiable Madame de Beauharnais, to whom Bonaparte had begun  to pay attention. He cared little for his friends, and ceased to address  them in the style of familiar equality.    After the 13th of Vendemiaire M. de Bourrienne saw Bonaparte only at  distant periods. In the month of February 1796 my husband was arrested,  at seven in the morning, by a party of men, armed with muskets, on the  charge of being a returned emigrant. He was torn from his wife and his  child, only six months old, being barely allowed time to dress himself.  I followed him. They conveyed him to the guard-house of the Section, and  thence I know not whither; and, finally, in the evening, they placed him  in the lockup-house of the prefecture of police, which, I believe, is  now called the central bureau. There he passed two nights and a day,  among men of the lowest description, some of whom were even malefactors.  I and his friends ran about everywhere, trying to find somebody to  rescue him, and, among the rest, Bonaparte was applied to. It was with  great difficulty he could be seen. Accompanied by one of my husband's  friends, I waited for the commandant of Paris until midnight, but he did  not come home. Next morning I returned at an early hour, and found him.  I stated what had happened to my husband, whose life was then at stake.  He appeared to feel very little for the situation of his friend, but,  however; determined to write to Merlin, the Minister of Justice. I  carried the letter according to its address, and met the Minister as  he was coming downstairs, on his way to the Directory. Being in grand  costume, he wore a Henri IV. hat, surmounted with a multitude of plumes,  a dress which formed a singular contrast with his person. He opened the  letter; and whether it was that he cared as little for the General as  for the cause of M. de Bourrienne's arrest, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35744"],[0,"The gradual acceptance of the Copernican theory of the universe (#13)"],[1,"de caetero, quovis  modo, teneat, doceat aut defendat, verbo aut scriptis,\" and that  Galileo promised to obey.[249] Rumors evidently were rife in Rome at  the time as to what had happened at this secret interview, for Galileo  wrote to the Cardinal in May asking for a statement of what actually  had occurred so that he might silence his enemies. The Cardinal  replied:         \"We, Robert Cardinal Bellarmin, having heard that Signor       Galileo was calumniated and charged with having abjured in       our hand, and also of being punished by salutary penance,       and being requested to give the truth, state that the       aforesaid Signor Galileo has not abjured in our hand nor in       the hand of any other person in Rome, still less in any       other place, so far as we know, any of his opinions and       teachings, nor has he received salutary penance nor any       other kind; but only was he informed of the declaration made       by his Holiness and published by the Sacred Congregation of       the Index, in which it is stated that the doctrine       attributed to Copernicus,--that the earth moves around the       sun and that the sun stands in the center of the world       without moving from the east to the west, is contrary to the       Holy Scriptures and therefore cannot be defended nor held       (non si possa difendere ne tenere). And in witness of this       we have written and signed these presents with our own hand,       this 26th day of May, 1616.         ROBERT CARDINAL BELLARMIN.\"[250]    [Footnote 248: Ibid: 61.]    [Footnote 249: Doc. in Favaro: 61-62.]    [Footnote 250: Ibid: 88.]    Galileo's defense sixteen years later[251] was that he had obeyed the  order as given him by the Cardinal and that he had not \"defended nor  held\" the doctrine in his _Dialoghi_ but had refuted it. The  Congregation answered that he had been ordered not only not to hold  nor defend, but also not to treat in any way (quovis modo) this  condemned subject. When Galileo disclaimed all recollection of that  phrase and produced the Cardinal's statement in support of his  position, he was told that this document, far from lightening his  guilt, greatly aggravated it since he had dared to deal with a subject  that he had been informed was contrary to the Holy Scriptures.[252]    [Footnote 251: Ibid: 80-86.]    [Footnote 252: Ibid: 145.]    To return to 1616. On the third of March the Cardinal reported to the  Congregation in the presence of the Pope that he had warned Galileo  and that Galileo had acquiesced.[253] The Congregation then reported  its decree suspending \"until corrected\" \"Nicolai Copernici De  Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, et Didaci Astunica in Job,\" and  prohibiting \"Epistola Fratris Pauli Antonii Foscarini Carmelitae,\"  together with all other books dealing with this condemned and  prohibited doctrine. The Pope ordered this decree to be published by  the Master of the Sacred Palace, which was done two days later.[254]  But this prohibition could not have been widely known for two or three  years; the next year Mulier published his edition of the _De  Revolutionibus_ at Amsterdam without a word of reference to it; in  1618 Thomas Feyens, professor at Louvain, heard vague rumors of the  condemnation and wondered if it could be true;[255] and the following  spring Fromundus, also at Louvain and later a noted antagonist of the  new doctrine, wrote to Feyens asking:         \"What did I hear lately from you about the Copernicans? That       they have been condemned a year or two ago by our Holy       Father, Pope Paul V? Until now I have known nothing about       it; no more have this crowd of German and Italian scholars,       very learned and, as I think, very Catholic, who admit with       Copernicus that the earth is turned. Is it possible that       after a lapse of time as considerable as this, we have       nothing more than a rumor of such an event? I find it hard       to believe, since nothing more definite has come from Italy.       Definitions of this sort ought above all to be published in       the universities where the learned men are to whom the       danger of such an opinion is very great.\"[256]    [Footnote 253: Ibid: 16.]    [Footnote 254: Doc. in Favaro: 16.]    [Footnote 255: Monchamp: 46.]    [Footnote 256: Fromundus: _De Cometa Anni_ 1618: chap. VII, p. 68.  (From the private library of Dr. E.E. Slosson. A rare book which Lecky  could not find. _History of Rationalism in Europe_, I, 280, note.)]    Galileo meanwhile had retired to Florence and devoted himself to  mechanical science, (of which his work is the foundation) though  constantly harassed by much ill health and many family perplexities.  At the advice of his friends, he allowed the attacks on the Copernican  doctrine to go unanswered,[257] till with the accession to the  papacy in 1623 of Cardinal Barberini, as Urban VIII, a warm admirer  and supporter of his, he thought relief was in sight. He was further  cheered by a conversation Cardinal di Zollern reported having had with  Pope Urban, in which his Holiness had reminded the Cardinal how he  (the Pope) had defended Copernicus in the time of Paul V, and asserted  that out of just respect owed to the memory of Copernicus, if he had  been pope then, he would not have permitted his opinion to be declared  heretical.[258] Feeling that he now had friends in power, Galileo  began his great work, _Dialogo sopra i Due Sistemi Massimi del Mondo_,  a dialogue in four \"days\" in which three interlocutors discuss the  arguments for and against the Copernican theory, though coming to no  definite conclusion. Sagredo was an avowed Copernican and Galileo's  spokesman, Salviati was openminded, and the peripatetic was Simplicio,  appropriately named for the famous Sicilian sixth century commentator  on Aristotle.[259]    [Footnote 257: In 1620 the Congregation issued the changes it required  to have made in the _De Revolutionibus_. They are nine in all, and  consist mainly in changing assertion of the earth's movement to  hypothetical statement and in striking out a reference to the earth as  a planet. Doc. in Favaro: 140-141. See illustration, p. 61.]    [Footnote 258: Doc. in Favaro: 149.]    [Footnote 259: Galileo: _Dialogo_: To the Reader.]    [Illustration: A \"CORRECTED\" PAGE FROM THE _De Revolutionibus_.    A photographic facsimile (reduced) of a page from Mulier's edition  (1617) of the _De Revolutionibus_ as \"corrected\" according to the  _Monitum_ of the Congregations in 1620. The first writer underlined  the passages to be deleted or altered with marginal notes indicating  the changes ordered; the second writer scratched out these passages,  and wrote out in full the changes the other had given in abbreviated  form. The _Notae_ are Mulier's own, and so were not affected by the  order. The effect of the page is therefore somewhat contradictory!]    In 1630 he brought the completed manuscript to Riccardi, Master of the  Sacred Palace, for permission to print it in Rome. After much reading  and re-reading of it both by Riccardi and his associate, Father  Visconti, permission was at length granted on condition that he insert  a preface and a conclusion practically dictated by Riccardi,  emphasizing its hypothetical character.[260] The Pope's own argument  was to be used: \"God is all-powerful; all things are therefore  possible to Him; ergo, the tides cannot be adduced as a necessary  proof of the double motion of the earth without limiting God's  omnipotence--which is absurd.\"[261] Galileo returned to Florence in  June with the permission to print his book in Rome. Meanwhile the  plague broke out. He decided to print it in Florence instead, and on  writing to Riccardi for that permission, the latter asked for the book  to review it again. The times were too troublesome to risk sending it,  so a compromise was finally effected: Galileo was to send the preface  and conclusion to Rome and Riccardi agreed to instruct the Inquisitor  at Florence as to his requirements and to authorize him to license the  book.[262] The parts were not returned from Rome till July, 1631, and  the book did not appear till February of the following year, when it  was published at Florence with all these licenses, both the Roman and  the Florentine ones.    [Footnote 260: Doc. in Favaro: 70.]    [Footnote 261: Fahie: 230.]    [Footnote 262: Ibid: 240.]    The _Dialogo_ was in Italian so that all could read it. It begins with  an outline of the Aristotelian system, then points out the  resemblances between the earth and the planets. The second \"day\"  demonstrates the daily rotation of the earth on its axis. The next  claims that the necessary stellar parallax is too minute to be  observed and discusses the earth's annual rotation. The last seeks to  prove this rotation by the ebb and flow of the tides. It is a  brilliant book and received a great reception.    The authorities of the Inquisition at once examined it and denounced  Galileo (April 17, 1633) because in it he not merely taught and  defended the \"condemned doctrine but was gravely suspected of firm  adherence to this opinion.\"[263] Other charges made against him were  that he had printed the Roman licenses without the permission of the  Congregation, that he had printed the preface in different type so  alienating it from the body of the book, and had put the required  conclusion into the mouth of a fool (Simplicio), that in many places  he had abandoned the hypothetical treatment and asserted the forbidden  doctrine, and that he had dealt indecisively with the matter though  the Congregation had specifically condemned the Copernican doctrine as  contrary to the express words of the Scripture.[264]    [Footnote 263: Doc. in Favaro: 88-89.
