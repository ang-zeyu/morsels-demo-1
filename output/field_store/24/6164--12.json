I obtained only three series free  from gaps: one of eight cocoons, comprising only females; one of six,  likewise consisting wholly of females; lastly, one of eight, formed  exclusively of males. These instances seem to show that the Psen  arranges her laying in a succession of females and a succession of  males; but they tell us nothing of the relative order of the two series.    From the Spider-huntress, Trypoxylon figulus, I learnt nothing  decisive. She appeared to me to rove about from one bramble to the next,  utilizing galleries which she has not dug herself. Not troubling to be  economical with a lodging which it has cost her nothing to acquire, she  carelessly builds a few partitions at very unequal heights, stuffs  three or four compartments with Spiders and passes on to another  bramble-stump, with no reason, so far as I know, for abandoning the  first. Her cells, therefore, occur in series that are too short to give  us any useful information.    This is all that the bramble-dwellers have to tell us; I have enumerated  the list of the principal ones in my district. We will now look  into some other Bees who arrange their cocoons in single files: the  Megachiles (Cf. Chapter 8 of the present volume.--Translator's Note.),  who cut disks out of leaves and fashion the disks into thimble-shaped  receptacles; the Anthidia (Cf. Chapters 9 and 10 of the present  volume.--Translator's Note.), who weave their honey-wallets out  of cotton-wool and arrange their cells one after the other in some  cylindrical gallery. In most cases, the home is the produce of neither  the one nor the other. A tunnel in the upright, earthy banks, the old  work of some Anthophora, is the usual dwelling. There is no great depth  to these retreats; and all my searches, zealously prosecuted during a  number of winters, procured me only series containing a small number of  cocoons, four or five at most, often one alone. And, what is quite as  serious, nearly all these series are spoilt by parasites and allow me to  draw no well-founded deductions.    I remembered finding, at rare intervals, nests of both the Anthidium and  the Megachile in the hollows of cut reeds. I thereupon installed  some hives of a new kind on the sunniest walls of my enclosure. They  consisted of stumps of the great reed of the south, open at one end,  closed at the other by the natural knot and gathered into a sort  of enormous pan-pipe, such as Polyphemus might have employed. The  invitation was accepted: Osmiae, Anthidia and Megachiles came in  fairly large numbers, especially the first, to benefit by the queer  installation.    In this way I obtained some magnificent series of Anthidia and  Megachiles, running up to a dozen. There was a melancholy side to  this success. All my series, with not one exception, were ravaged by  parasites. Those of the Megachile (M. sericans, FONSCOL), who fashions  her goblets with robinia-, holm-, and terebinth-leaves, were inhabited  by Coelioxys octodentata (A Parasitic Bee.--Translator's Note.); those  of the Anthidium (A. florentinum, LATR.) were occupied by a Leucopsis.  Both kinds were swarming with a colony of pigmy parasites whose name I  have not yet been able to discover. In short, my pan-pipe hives, though  very useful to me from other points of view, taught me nothing about the  order of the sexes among the Leaf-cutters and the cotton-weavers.    I was more fortunate with three Osmiae (O. tricornis, LATR., O. cornuta,  LATR., and O. Latreillii, SPIN.), all of whom gave me splendid results,  with reed-stumps arranged either against the walls of my garden, as I  have just said, or near their customary abode, the huge nests of the  Mason-bee of the Sheds. One of them, the Three-horned Osmia, did  better still: as I have described, she built her nests in my study, as  plentifully as I could wish, using reeds, glass tubes and other retreats  of my selecting for her galleries.    We will consult this last, who has furnished me with documents beyond  my fondest hopes, and begin by asking her of how many eggs her average  laying consists. Of the whole heap of colonized tubes in my study, or  else out of doors, in the hurdle-reeds and the pan-pipe appliances, the  best-filled contains fifteen cells, with a free space above the series,  a space showing that the laying is ended, for, if the mother had any  more eggs available, she would have lodged them in the room which she  leaves unoccupied. This string of fifteen appears to be rare; it was the  only one that I found. My attempts at indoor rearing, pursued during two  years with glass tubes or reeds, taught me that the Three-horned  Osmia is not much addicted to long series. As though to decrease the  difficulties of the coming deliverance, she prefers short galleries, in  which only a part of the laying is stacked. We must then follow the same  mother in her migration from one dwelling to the next if we would obtain  a complete census of her family. A spot of colour, dropped on the Bee's  thorax with a paint-brush while she is absorbed in closing up the mouth  of the tunnel, enables us to recognize the Osmia in her various homes.    In this way, the swarm that resided in my study furnished me, in the  first year, with an average of twelve cells. Next year, the summer  appeared to be more favourable and the average became rather higher,  reaching fifteen. The most numerous laying performed under my eyes, not  in a tube, but in a succession of Snail-shells, reached the figure of  twenty-six. On the other hand, layings of between eight and ten are not  uncommon. Lastly, taking all my records together, the result is that the  family of the Osmia fluctuates round about fifteen in number.    I have already spoken of the great differences in size apparent in  the cells of one and the same series. The partitions, at first widely  spaced, draw gradually nearer to one another as they come closer to  the aperture, which implies roomy cells at the back and narrow cells in  front. The contents of these compartments are no less uneven between one  portion and another of the string. Without any exception known to me,  the large cells, those with which the series starts, have more abundant  provisions than the straitened cells with which the series ends. The  heap of honey and pollen in the first is twice or even thrice as large  as that in the second. In the last cells, the most recent in date,  the victuals are but a pinch of pollen, so niggardly in amount that we  wonder what will become of the larva with that meagre ration.    One would think that the Osmia, when nearing the end of the laying,  attaches no importance to her last-born, to whom she doles out space  and food so sparingly. The first-born receive the benefit of her  early enthusiasm: theirs is the well-spread table, theirs the spacious  apartments. The work has begun to pall by the time that the last eggs  are laid; and the last-comers have to put up with a scurvy portion of  food and a tiny corner.    The difference shows itself in another way after the cocoons are spun.  The large cells, those at the back, receive the bulky cocoons; the small  ones, those in front, have cocoons only a half or a third as big. Before  opening them and ascertaining the sex of the Osmia inside, let us wait  for the transformation into the perfect insect, which will take place  towards the end of summer. If impatience gets the better of us, we can  open them at the end of July or in August. The insect is then in the  nymphal stage; and it is easy, under this form, to distinguish the two  sexes by the length of the antennae, which are larger in the males,  and by the glassy protuberances on the forehead, the sign of the future  armour of the females. Well, the small cocoons, those in the narrow  front cells, with their scanty store of provisions, all belong to males;  the big cocoons, those in the spacious and well-stocked cells at the  back, all belong to females.    The conclusion is definite: the laying of the Three-horned Osmia  consists of two distinct groups, first a group of females and then a  group of males.    With my pan-pipe apparatus displayed on the walls of my enclosure and  with old hurdle-reeds left lying flat out of doors, I obtained the  Horned Osmia in fair quantities. I persuaded Latreille's Osmia to  build her nest in reeds, which she did with a zeal which I was far from  expecting. All that I had to do was to lay some reed-stumps horizontally  within her reach, in the immediate neighbourhood of her usual haunts,  namely, the nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds. Lastly, I succeeded  without difficulty in making her build her nests in the privacy of my  study, with glass tubes for a house. The result surpassed my hopes.    With both these Osmiae, the division of the gallery is the same as  with the Three-horned Osmia. At the back are large cells with plentiful  provisions and widely-spaced partitions; in front, small cells, with  scanty provisions and partitions close together. Also, the larger cells  supplied me with big cocoons and females; the smaller cells gave me  little cocoons and males. The conclusion therefore is exactly the same  in the case of all three Osmiae.    Before dismissing the Osmiae, let us devote a moment to their cocoons, a  comparison of which, in the matter of bulk, will furnish us with fairly  accurate evidence as to the relative size of the two sexes, for the  thing contained, the perfect insect, is evidently proportionate to the  silken wrapper in which it is enclosed. These cocoons are oval-shaped  and may be regarded as ellipsoids formed by a revolution around the  major axis. The volume of one of these solids is expressed in the  following formula:    4 / 3 x pi x a x (b squared),    in which 2a is the major axis and 2b the minor axis.

[Sidenote: 15. Meats, whence derived? Why important? Flesh of young  animals?]    15. MEATS.--The meats, so called, are derived from the muscular parts of  various animals. They are most {69} important articles of food for adults,  inasmuch as they are richly stored with albuminoid substances, and contain  more or less fat. Such food is very nourishing and easily digested if eaten  when fresh,--veal and pork being exceptions. The flesh of young animals is  more tender and, in general, more digestible than that of older ones. All  meat is more tough immediately after the killing of the animal, but  improves by being kept a certain length of time.    [Sidenote: 16. Preference of persons? Venison? Mutton? Cheese? Uncooked  flesh?]    16. Some persons prefer flesh that has begun to show signs of  decomposition, or is unmistakably putrid. By some, venison is not  considered to have its proper flavor until it is tainted. In England,  people prefer mutton that is in a similar condition, just as on the  continent of Europe many delight in cheese that is in a state of  decomposition. In certain less civilized countries flesh is not only eaten  uncooked, but in a mouldy, rotten condition. The use of such food is not  always immediately injurious, but it predisposes to certain diseases, as  indigestion and fevers.    [Sidenote: 17. Cold as a preserver? Meat in Russia? Beef and pork, how  preserved? Salted meat as food? Scurvy?]    17. Cold is one means of preserving meat from decay. In the markets of  northern Russia, the frozen carcases of animals stand exposed for sale in  the winter air for a considerable time, and are sawn in pieces, like sticks  of wood, as the purchases are made; such meat, when thawed, being entirely  fit for food. Beef and pork are preserved by salting down in brine, and in  this condition may be carried on long voyages or kept for future use.  Salted meat is not as nutritious as fresh, since the brine absorbs its rich  juices and hardens its fibres. Long continued use of salt meats, without  fresh vegetables, gives rise to the disease called scurvy, formerly very  prevalent on shipboard and in prisons; but now scarcely known.    [Sidenote: 18. The antiquity of the custom of cooking food? Object of  cooking? The oyster? Raw meat as an occasional food?]    18. COOKING.--The preparation of food by the agency {70} of fire is of  almost universal practice, even among the rudest nations. The object of  cooking is to render food more easy of digestion by softening it, to  develop its flavor, and to raise its temperature more nearly to that of the  body. A few articles of flesh-food are eaten uncooked in civilized lands,  the oyster being an instance. Raw meat is occasionally eaten by invalids  with weak digestive powers, and by men training for athletic contests.    [Sidenote: 19. Effect of boiling meat? How may the cooking be done? The  proper method? Effect? Making of soup?]    19. In boiling meat, the water in which it is placed tends to dissolve its  nutrient juices. In fact, the cooking may be so conducted as to rob the  meat of its nourishment, its tenderness, and even of its flavor. The proper  method, in order to preserve or promote these qualities, is to place the  meat in boiling water, which, after a few minutes, should be reduced in  temperature. In this way the intense heat, at first, coagulates the  exterior layers of albumen, and imprisons the delicate juices; after that,  moderate heat best softens it throughout. When soup is to be made, an  opposite course should be pursued; for then the object is to extract the  juices and reject the fibre. Meat, for such purpose, should be cut in small  pieces and put into cold water, which should then be gradually raised to  boiling heat.    [Sidenote: 20. Roasting? How should it be done? Give the philosophy of the  process. Frying?]    20. Roasting is probably the best method of cooking meat, especially  \"joints\" or large pieces, as by this process the meat is cooked in its own  juices. Roasting should begin with intense heat, and be continued at a  moderate temperature, in order to prevent the drying out of the nutritious  juices, as by this process an outer coating or crust of coagulated albumen  is formed. During this process the meat loses one-fourth of its weight, but  the loss is almost wholly water, evaporated by the heat. Too {71} intense  or prolonged heat will dry the meat, or burn it. Frying is the worst  possible method, as the heated fat, by penetrating the meat, or other  article placed in it, dries and hardens it, and thus renders it  indigestible.    [Sidenote: 21. What is \"Trichina?\" How guarded against?]    21. TRICHINA.--It should be remembered that ham, sausages, and other forms  of pork, should never be eaten in a raw or imperfectly cooked condition.  The muscle of the pig is often infested by a minute animal parasite, or  worm, called _trichina spiralis_. This worm may be introduced alive into  the human body in pork food, where it multiplies with great rapidity, and  gives rise to a painful and serious disease. This disease has been  prevalent in Germany, and cases of it occur from time to time in this  country.    [Sidenote: 22. What part of fish is eaten? What does it resemble? Fish as  food for digestion? Fish as a diet?]    22. FISH.--The part of fish that is eaten is the muscle, just as in the  case of the meats and poultry. It closely resembles flesh in its  composition, but is more watery. Some varieties are very easy of digestion,  such as salmon, trout, and cod; others are quite indigestible, especially  lobsters, clams, and shell-fish generally. A diet in which fish enters as  the chief article, is ill adapted to strengthen mind or body, while its  continued use is said to be the fertile source of nearly every form of  disease of the skin. Some persons are so constituted that they can eat no  kind of fish without experiencing unpleasant results.    [Sidenote: 23. List of vegetable articles? Usefulness of the different  vegetables? Strychnia? What further is said in relation to the nourishing  and other qualities of vegetables?]    23. VEGETABLE FOOD.--The list of vegetable articles of diet is a very long  one, including the grains from which our bread-stuffs are made, the  vegetables from the garden, and the fruits. All the products of the  vegetable kingdom are not alike useful. Some are positively hurtful;  indeed, the most virulent poisons, as strychnia and prussic acid, are  obtained from certain vegetables. Again, of such {72} articles as have been  found good for food, some are more nourishing than others: some require  very little preparation for use, while others are hard and indigestible,  and can only be used after undergoing many preparatory processes. Great  care must therefore be exercised, and many experiments made, before we can  arrive at a complete knowledge in reference to these articles of diet. Tea,  coffee, and other substances from which drinks are made, are of vegetable  origin.    [Sidenote: 24. Wheat? \"Staff of life?\" White flour? Hard-grain wheats?  Bolting? Graham bread?]    24. BREAD.--Wheat is the principal and most valuable kind of grain for the  service of man. Bread made from wheat-flour has been in use for many  hundreds of years, and on this account, as well as because of its highly  nourishing properties, has been aptly called \"the staff of life.\" We never  become tired of good bread as an article of daily food.    The white kinds of flour contain more starch and less gluten than the  darker, and are therefore less nutritious. The hard-grain wheat yields the  best flour. In grinding wheat, the chaff or bran is separated by a process  called \"bolting.\" Unbolted flour is used for making brown or Graham bread.    [Sidenote: 25. Leavened bread? Unleavened? Hot bread?]    25. The form of bread most easily digested is that which has been  \"leavened,\" or rendered porous by the use of yeast, or by some similar  method. Unleavened bread requires much more mastication. Hot bread is  unwholesome, because it is not firm enough to be thoroughly masticated, but  is converted into a pasty, heavy mass that is not easily digested.    [Sidenote: 26. Wheaten bread? Bread and butter? Experiment on the dog?]    26. Wheaten bread contains nearly every principle requisite for sustaining  life, except fat. This is commonly added in other articles of diet,  especially in butter,--\"bread and butter,\" consequently, forming an almost  perfect article of {73} food. The following experiment is recorded: \"A dog  eating _ad libitum_ of white bread, made of pure wheat, and freely supplied  with water, did not live beyond fifty days. He died at the end of that time  with all the signs of gradual exhaustion.\" Death took place, not because  there was anything hurtful in the bread, but because of the absence of one  or more of the food-principles.    [Sidenote: 27. State what is said of the Irish potato?]    27. THE POTATO.--The common or Irish potato is the vegetable most  extensively used in this country and Great Britain. Among the poorer  classes in Ireland it is the main article of food. While it is not so rich  in nutritious substances as many others, it has some very useful qualities.  It keeps well from season to season, and men do not weary of its continuous  use. It is more than two-thirds water, the balance being chiefly starch,  with a little albumen.    [Sidenote: 28. Sweet potato? Nightshades? Potatoes when germinating?]    28. The sweet potato differs from the white or common, in containing more  water and a small proportion of sugar. The common potato and the tomato  belong to the same botanical order as the \"nightshades,\" but do not possess  their poisonous qualities, unless we except potatoes that are in the  process of germination or sprouting, when they are found injurious as food.
