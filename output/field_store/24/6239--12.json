It seems that the vocal sac atrophys in the non-breeding  season. These seasonal changes may account for the diagnoses given by  Taylor (_op. cit._) and Taylor and Smith (_op. cit._); likewise, since  many of the specimens obtained by Smith in the dry season were  juveniles and subadults, the development of the vomerine ridges could  not be diagnosed properly.    The range of this species encompasses the Pacific slopes of the Isthmus  of Tehuantepec eastward to the upper Cintalapa Valley and vicinity of  Tonala in western Chiapas. Priscilla Starrett collected tadpoles of _H.  sumichrasti_ from a stream 19 km. N of Arriaga, Chiapas. These limited  observations on the ecology of this frog suggest that it breeds in the  fast-moving streams of the Pacific slopes, and that it seeks shelter in  arboreal bromeliads during the dry season.      =Phrynohyas modesta= Taylor and Smith         _Oaxaca_: Tuxtepec. _Veracruz_: 20 km. S of Jesus Carranza;       20 km. ENE of Jesus Carranza (2); Minatitlan.    I have not collected this species in the isthmus. The locality records  indicate that the range is discontinuous (Duellman, 1956:27). The  species occurs on the humid Pacific slopes from south-central Chiapas  eastward to El Salvador and on the humid Gulf lowlands from southern  Veracruz eastward into Tabasco, but is unknown from the dry Pacific  slopes and plains in the isthmus.    The acquisition of several specimens of this species in southern  Veracruz, Tabasco, and Oaxaca, together with a knowledge of the  variation displayed by _Phrynohyas spilomma_, suggests that _modesta_  may be a color variety of _spilomma_.      =Phrynohyas spilomma= Cope         _Oaxaca_: Tapanatepec (3). _Veracruz_: Amatitlan (12);       Chacaltianguis (2); Ciudad Aleman (6); Cosamaloapan;       Novillero (3).    Like the preceding species, this frog is unknown from the arid Pacific  lowlands of the isthmus; its presence at Tapanatepec, a locality  situated in more mesic conditions than prevail on the Plains of  Tehuantepec, indicates that it may have a distribution on the Pacific  slopes much like that of _P. modesta_. Furthermore, this frog was not  detected in the rainforests of the Gulf lowlands; in that region it was  found only in scrub forest and savanna.    On July 26, 1956, numerous choruses of these frogs were heard between  Ciudad Aleman and Tlacotalpan, Veracruz. The call is a loud, nasal  \"grawl\" repeated continuously. The males call from the water. Several  clasping pairs were found in shallow grassy ponds amidst the scrub  forest. The ground color varies from reddish brown to tan with dark  brown dorsal markings. The iris is golden, and the vocal sacs are dark  olive brown. After a light shower during the dry season, six  individuals were found on the low branches of trees at night near  Ciudad Aleman.      =Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori= Funkhouser         _Oaxaca_: Donaji (9); Sarabia (8); Tolosita (6); Ubero (27).       _Veracruz_: Alvarado (7); Aquilera; Berta; Coatzacoalcos       (9); 10 km. SE of Hueyapan (5); Naranja (17).    In life this frog presents a striking array of colors. The dorsum  varies from pale green to dark olive green; there may be scattered  whitish or cream-colored spots on the back. On the flanks are bright  yellow to deep cream-colored vertical bars separated by pale blue or  purple interspaces. The thighs and undersurfaces of the hind limbs are  golden orange; the belly is yellow, and the throat is cream-colored.  The iris is crimson; the transparent part of the lower eyelid has  golden reticulations. When the frog is resting, the forefeet are folded  beneath the throat, and the limbs are folded tightly against the body.  In this position and with the eyes closed and head flattened, this  gaudy frog assumes the appearance of a small elliptical green leaf.    Throughout the month of July, 1956, _Phyllomedusa_ was breeding in  ponds in or adjacent to the rainforest in northern Oaxaca and in  southern Veracruz. Only at Alvarado was it found breeding in a grassy  pond. Males and females alike were found on bushes and trees in and  around the ponds. The call is a single \"wank.\" Amplexing males continue  to call, but the call is softer and less nasal in quality. The eggs are  encased in pale green gelatin and attached to leaves on branches  overhanging the water. Three egg clutches contained 38, 41, and 46  eggs.      =Phyllomedusa dacnicolor= Cope         _Oaxaca_: Escurano; Tehuantepec.    Although it is abundant on the Pacific lowlands to the northwest in  Guerrero, Michoacan, and Colima, this species is known only from two  specimens from Tehuantepec. There is no apparent physical barrier to  their distribution in the isthmus; in the Balsas Basin the species  lives in a hotter, more arid environment than that at Tehuantepec.      =Gastrophryne usta= Cope         _Oaxaca_: Santa Efigenia; Tehuantepec (10); 24 km. W of       Tehuantepec; Tolosita (2). _Veracruz_: Ayentes (6); La       Oaxaquena; Novillero (2); San Lorenzo.    Calling males were found in open scrub forest near Tehuantepec and in  savannas near Novillero. The specimens from Tolosita were found under  cover in a clearing in the forest (Fugler and Webb, 1957:106).    Specimens from the Pacific lowlands are typical of _Gastrophryne usta  gadowi_ Boulenger in possessing a thin line on the posterior surface of  the thighs and a thin line from the snout to the vent. Of nine  specimens from the Gulf lowlands (Ayentes, Novillero, and San Lorenzo),  seven have a middorsal line; this is narrow in four and wide in three.  Five have the stripes on the thighs. Two specimens from the middle of  the isthmus (Tolosita) have no stripes on the thighs; one has a thin  middorsal line, and the other has a broad line. The adult males have a  black throat; females have a mottled one. The brown reticulations on  the bellies of specimens from the Gulf lowlands is bolder than on  specimens from the Pacific lowlands. The presence of certain characters  supposedly diagnostic of the subspecies _gadowi_ (line on dorsum and  thighs) in the population of _usta_ in southern Veracruz suggests that  a redefinition of the ranges of these subspecies will be in order when  sufficient material is available to delimit them accurately. For the  present I prefer to consider all specimens from the isthmus solely as  _Gastrophryne usta_ without referring them to subspecies.      =Rana palmipes= Spix         _Oaxaca_: Matias Romero (11); 11 km. S of Santiago Chivela;       Santo Domingo; Sarabia. _Veracruz_: Coatzacoalcos;       Cuatotolapam; 25 km. SE of Jesus Carranza (4); Tlacotalpan       (2); Tula.    Adults were found along streams and in marshes in savannas and  rainforest. These frogs are wary and difficult to capture, even at  night. _Rana palmipes_ is another species that has a discontinuous  distribution in the isthmus. The species does not occur on the Pacific  lowlands of the isthmus, but does occur on the more humid Pacific  slopes of Chiapas and Guatemala.    Tadpoles were found in a small sluggish tributary to the Rio Sarabia.      =Rana pipiens= Schreber         _Oaxaca_: Agua Caliente; Cerro Quiengola; Escurano (14); Rio       Sarabia (2); Tapanatepec (5); Tehuantepec (24). _Veracruz_:       Acayucan; Cuatotolapam (15); Jesus Carranza (2); 20 km. S of       Jesus Carranza (11); 25 km. SE of Jesus Carranza; 20 km. ENE       of Jesus Carranza (10); San Lorenzo (10).    As in most other places in Mexico and northern Central America, this  species occurs wherever there is permanent water. Males were heard  calling from woodland ponds and from savanna ponds.          SUMMARY      Investigations of the amphibians and their environments in the Isthmus  of Tehuantepec have been presented with the aim of gaining an  understanding of the present biological and of the historical events  responsible for the present patterns of distribution of amphibians in  this region.    The Isthmus of Tehuantepec embraces three major environments--savanna,  semi-arid scrub forest, and quasi-rainforest. The rainforest presents  an environment noticeably different from the other two and has a  different amphibian fauna.    Analysis of present patterns of distribution shows that certain species  are restricted to the rainforests on the Gulf lowlands; others live  only in the semi-arid scrub forests on the Pacific lowlands. A third  group of species lives on both the Gulf and Pacific lowlands; most of  these species occur only in the scrub forests or savannas on the Gulf  lowlands, but some also inhabit the rainforest. In one way or another  the isthmus presents a barrier to the distribution of 75 per cent of  the species of amphibians living in the lowlands; it is a greater  barrier still to the species inhabiting the highlands on either side.    Present patterns of distribution are attributed to bioclimatic  fluctuation in the Pleistocene. In the course of these climatic shifts,  tropical environments and their amphibian inhabitants seem to have  survived in the isthmian region.    The amphibian fauna of the lowlands of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec  consists of 16 genera and 36 species. Systematic studies of all  available specimens from the region show that _Eleutherodactylus  conspicuus_ Taylor and Smith is a synonym of _Eleutherodactylus  alfredi_ Boulenger and that _Hyla axillamembrana_ Shannon and Werler is  a synonym of _Hyla loquax_ Gaige and Stuart.

Even the objectionable  manner in which the system was administered during more than fifty years  in Australia and Van Diemen's land could not entirely destroy its  beneficial effects upon the criminal, or blind an unprejudiced observer to  the advantages and general utility of transportation as a means of  punishment. In 1787 the eastern coast of Australia, chiefly in consequence  of the too glowing accounts of the suitability of the harbours, and the  fertility of the soil of Botany Bay, was selected by the British  Government as the site of a penal colony, and on the 26th January, 1788,  the first batch of convicts was landed there. These consisted of 600 males  and 250 women, and were accompanied by an escort of 200 men. Forty of the  latter were married men, who were accompanied by their wives and children.  The whole expedition was under the command of Captain Phillip, the first  Governor of the new settlement.[25]    The colonists had scarcely settled down after their arrival on, as was  speedily found, the anything but safe or fertile shores of Botany Bay, ere  they were removed to another harbour, lying about seven miles further  north, beautifully situate, and fulfilling every requirement, which they  named Port Jackson.    The first free settlers did not make their appearance till 1794. The  officers of the garrison were merchants also, and trafficked in whatever  merchandise they could find. Rum especially was a chief article. A  Government regulation required every ship which should put into Port  Jackson, to deliver a certain proportion of her spirits to the officers  according to their rank!! They also received a list of the merchandise  brought by each ship, from which they selected whatever seemed most  profitable, which they disposed of again at retail to the soldiers,  settlers, and convicts at an immense profit. Further, the officers enjoyed  the entire monopoly of importing spirits, as also the exclusive privilege  of selling them to the retail merchants. By these devices many of them  amassed considerable fortunes by trade, and thus the repeated efforts made  by a succession of Governors to effect a reform in the colony were  rendered fruitless. During the administration of Captain Bligh, so widely  known in connection with the tragic fate of the mutineers of the _Bounty_,  rum was the most valuable article of exchange, and the colonists found by  bitter experience that there were no other sellers of this destructive  drink than the privileged few.    The utmost anarchy and violence reigned supreme throughout New South  Wales at that period; the power of the Government was set entirely at  nought, license and violence usurped the place of law and order; the  convicts found they were not under any effective control or supervision;  whole bands of them infested the country as \"bush-rangers,\" till they grew  so bold as to enter the dwellings of peaceful settlers in broad day, where  they perpetrated the most cruel excesses.    In 1807 Mr. McArthur and Captain Abbot of the 102nd introduced the first  distilling apparatus into the country for cheapening the production of  ardent spirits. The Governor forthwith confiscated the apparatus, and  forbade distillation in any part of the colony. This prohibition gave rise  among those interested to dissensions, which gradually rose to such a  height, that about a year thereafter it led to Bligh being placed in  confinement by some of his own officers. The English Government however  now began to perceive that such a state of carelessness could no longer be  endured, and not only reinstated Bligh, but promoted him to the rank of  Admiral.    On their arrival in the colony the prisoners were sent to barracks in  Sydney, where the Government selected from their number such  handicraftsmen as they required for the public works, while the remainder  were distributed as land cultivators, labourers, artisans, &c., among such  private individuals as had made themselves agreeable to the Government. As  free labour was rare and expensive in the colony at that period, the  requests for such allocations of forced labour were greatly in excess of  the number of workmen so available.    Those consigned to private individuals were taken into the interior in  charge of a constable or overseer, where they were required to build a  shelter for themselves, which, owing to the mildness of the climate, could  be very speedily accomplished. The hours of work were from 6 A.M. to 6  P.M., and the main feature was that the convict durst not leave his  employer, whether kind and good-tempered, or harsh and cruel. When there  was no further occasion for their services they were remitted to  Government, who found another employer for them.    All land-holders in the colony were entitled, on preferring a request to  the Governor to that effect, to have assigned them, according to the  current quantity of disposable labour, in the proportion of one workman to  every 320 acres of land; but no settler, no matter how extensive his  holding, could \"take on\" more than 75 convicts. Each employer had to  engage to keep the convict assigned him one month at least, and provide,  at his own cost, food and clothing according to a scale fixed by  Government.    The weekly rations consisted of nine lbs. wheaten flour, or at the option  of the employer, three lbs. Indian corn, and seven lbs. of wheat flour,  seven lbs. of beef or mutton, four lbs. salt pork, two oz. salt, two oz.  soap. The clothing consisted of two jackets annually, three shirts of  canvas or cotton, two pairs of drawers, three pairs of shoes of stout  leather, and a hat or cap. Each labourer was also allowed the use of a  counterpane and mattress, which however remained the property of the  employer. These legal privileges had however been extended through custom  or the favour of the employers to various little articles of luxury, such  as tobacco, sugar, tea, grog, &c. In particular, with the object of  ensuring the utmost zeal on the part of the workman during the harvest  season, it was almost imperative at that season to show him those little  relaxations and favours which at length became customary, and in no slight  degree enhanced the cost of his maintenance.    On the arrival of a convict ship a crowd used to hurry down to await the  moment when the convicts were to be allotted to applicants. As no special  memoranda were made during the voyage of the offence for which each man  had been transported, or his subsequent conduct on the voyage, the  administration were not in a position to make such a selection as should  classify the prisoners, and assign them according to nature of crime and  subsequent behaviour to a determined or a more gentle employer. Hence  resulted the most lamentable injustice; the most truculent of these men  occasionally were assigned to the gentle masters, while a less hardened  criminal came under the yoke of a hard-hearted task-master, and thus had  an infinitely more severe lot to bewail than he in fact deserved.    Such a harsh, and in too many cases unjust, method of dealing with them,  drove the convicts to the commission of fresh offences, or even crimes,  and, in desperation at the wrongs to which they were exposed, they not  merely neglected utterly the interests of their temporary masters, but in  many cases, impelled by a fierce thirst for vengeance, they burned house  and property over his head at the harvest time!    The chronic alarm and anxiety of the colony during a long period was not  however traceable to the principle of the system itself, but to the method  in which it was worked by self-seeking natives, greedy of gain. No sooner  had the most glaring of the evils been rectified, and by means of a  powerful government law and order resumed their wonted sway, ere the young  colony began to make most unexpected strides in developing its  capabilities, and both in the unfolding of its natural resources and in  its trade and commerce ere long attracted the attention, not merely of  England and her manufacturers, but of all Europe.    In 1840 New South Wales ceased to be a convict settlement, at which period  there were 130,856 souls in the colony, 26,967 of whom were convicts. In  1857, when the last census was taken, there were in all 305,487, of whom  171,673 were males, and 133,814 females, who inhabited 41,479 houses, 1725  huts, 50 waggons, and 75 ships, and subsisted chiefly by pasture and  agriculture.    The morality of this population diffused over 321,579 square miles has  greatly improved, thanks to the unlimited freedom of individual power to  develope itself, and the opportunities afforded for leading an  independent, comfortable life, and in the interests of Truth we must add,  that in no part of Europe would any one be left so unfettered to travel  about alone and unarmed, or require less precautions, as in this once  penal colony.    The number of criminal cases of all sorts in the colony during the last  ten years, during which the population has increased from 189,600 to  266,189, is as follows:--      1848 ... 445 accused, of whom were executed 4    1849 ... 534   --         --      --        4    1850 ... 555   --         --      --        4    1851 ... 574   --         --      --        2    1852 ... 527   --         --      --        5    1853 ... 604   --         --      --        2    1854 ... 637   --         --      --        6    1855 ... 526   -- (one of these a woman)    5    1856 ... 461   --         --      --        0    1857 ... 395   --         --      --        4    One must not forget to take into account that by far the larger portion of  the population are recruited from the lower class, as measured by  education.
