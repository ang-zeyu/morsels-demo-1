Scarcely two seconds had passed when the barrel which was on the cart  burst with a frightful explosion. No one of the escort or of the  companions of the First Consul was slain, but several were wounded; and  the loss among the residents in the street and the passers-by near the  horrible machine was much greater. More than twenty of these were  killed, and more than sixty seriously wounded. Trepsat, the architect,  had his thigh broken. The First Consul afterwards decorated him, and  made him the architect of the Invalides, saying that he had long enough  been the most invalid of architects. All the panes of glass at the  Tuileries were broken, and many houses thrown down. All those of the  Rue Sainte-Nicaise, and even some in the adjacent streets, were badly  damaged, some fragments being blown into the house of the Consul  Cambaceres. The glass of the First Consul's carriage was shivered to  fragments. By a fortunate chance, the carriages of the suite, which  should have been immediately behind that of the First Consul, were some  distance in the rear, which happened in this way: Madame Bonaparte, after  dinner, had a shawl brought to wear to the opera; and when it came,  General Rapp jestingly criticised the color, and begged her to choose  another. Madame Bonaparte defended her shawl, and said to the general  that he knew as much about criticising a toilet as she did about  attacking a fort. This friendly banter continued for some moments; and  in the interval, the First Consul, who never waited, set out in advance,  and the miserable assassins and authors of the conspiracy set fire to the  infernal machine. Had the coachman of the First Consul driven less  rapidly, and thereby been two seconds later, it would have been all over  with his master; while, on the other hand, if Madame Bonaparte had  followed her husband promptly, it would have been certain death to her  and all her suite.    It was, in fact, the delay of an instant which saved her life, as well as  that of her daughter, her sister-in-law, Madame Murat, and all who were  to accompany them, since the carriage of these ladies, instead of being  immediately behind that of the First Consul, was just leaving the Place  Carrousel, when the machine exploded. The glass was shivered; and though  Madame Bonaparte received no injury except the terrible fright, Hortense  was slightly wounded in the face by a piece of glass, and Madame Caroline  Murat, who was then far advanced in pregnancy, was so frightened that it  was necessary to carry her back to the Tuileries. This catastrophe had  its influence, even on the health of her child; for I have been told that  Prince Achille Muratz is subject, to this day, to frequent attacks of  epilepsy. As is well known, the First Consul went on to the opera, where  he was received with tumultuous acclamations, the immobility of his  countenance contrasting strongly with the pallor and agitation of Madame  Bonaparte's, who had feared not so much for herself as for him. The  coachman who had driven the First Consul with such good fortune was named  Germain. He had followed him in Egypt, and in a skirmish had killed an  Arab, with his own hand, under the eyes of the general-in-chief, who,  struck with his courage, had cried out, \"Diable! that's a brave man, he  is a Caesar.\" The name had clung to him. It has been said that this  brave man was drunk at the time of this explosion; but this is a mistake,  which his conduct under the circumstances contradicts in the most  positive manner. When the First Consul, after he became Emperor, went  out, incognito, in Paris, it was Caesar who was his escort, without  livery. It is said in the Memorial de Sainte Helene that the Emperor,  in speaking of Caesar, stated that he was in a complete state of  intoxication, and took the noise of the explosion for an artillery  salute, nor did he know until the next day what had taken place. This is  entirely untrue, and the Emperor was incorrectly informed in regard to  his coachman. Caesar drove the First Consul very rapidly because he had  been ordered to do so, and because he considered his honor interested in  not allowing the obstacle which the infernal machine placed in his way  before the explosion to delay him. The evening of the event I saw  Caesar, who was perfectly sober, and he himself related to me part of the  details that I have just given. A few days after, four or five hundred  hackney-coachmen clubbed together to honor him, and gave him a  magnificent dinner at twenty-four francs per head.    While the infernal plot was being executed, and costing the lies of many  innocent citizens, without attaining the object the assassins proposed,  I was, as I have said, at the Theatre Feydeau, where I had prepared  myself to enjoy at my leisure an entire evening of freedom, amid the  pleasures of the stage, for which I had all my life a great liking.  Scarcely had I seated myself comfortably, however, when the box-keeper  entered in the greatest excitement, crying out, \"Monsieur Constant, it is  said that they have just blown up the First Consul; there has been a  terrible explosion, and it is asserted that he is dead.\" These terrible  words were like a thunderbolt-to me. Not knowing what I did, I plunged  down-stairs, and, forgetting my hat, ran like mad to the chateau. While  crossing Rue Vivienne and the Palais Royal, I saw no extraordinary  disturbance; but in Rue Sainte Honore there was a very great tumult, and  I saw, borne away on litters, many dead and wounded, who had been at  first carried into the neighboring houses of Rue Sainte Nicaise. Many  groups had formed, and with one voice all were cursing the still unknown  authors of this dastardly attempt. Some accused the Jacobins of this,  because three months before they had placed the poniard in the hands of  Cerrachi, of Arena, and of Topino Lebrun; whilst others, less numerous  perhaps, thought the aristocrats, the Royalists, could alone be guilty of  this atrocity. I could give no time to these various accusations, except  as I was detained in forcing my way through an immense and closely packed  crowd, and as rapidly as possible went on, and in two seconds was at the  Carrousel. I threw myself against the wicket, but the two sentinels  instantly crossed bayonets before my breast. It was useless to cry out  that I was valet de chambre of the First Consul; for my bare head, my  wild manner, the disorder, both of my dress and ideas, appeared to them  suspicious, and they refused energetically and very obstinately to allow  me to enter. I then begged them to send for the gatekeeper of the  chateau; and as soon as he came, I was admitted, or rather rushed into  the chateau, where I learned what had just happened. A short time after  the First Consul arrived, and was immediately surrounded by his officers,  and by all his household, every one present being in the greatest state  of anxiety. When the First Consul alighted from his carriage he appeared  calm and smiling; he even wore an air of gayety. On entering the  vestibule he said to his officers, rubbing his hands, \"Well, sirs, we  made a fine escape!\" They shuddered with indignation and anger. He then  entered the grand saloon on the ground floor, where a large number of  counselors of state and-dignitaries had already assembled; but hardly had  they begun to express their congratulations, when he interrupted them,  and in so vehement a manner that he was heard outside the saloon. We  were told that after this council he had a lively altercation with  Fouche, Minister of Police, whom he reproached with his ignorance of  this plot, openly accusing the Jacobins of being the authors.    That evening, on retiring, the First Consul asked me laughingly if I was  afraid. \"More than you were, my general,\" I replied; and I related to  him how I had heard the fatal news at the Feydeau, and had run without my  hat to the very wicket of the Carrousel, where the sentinels tried to  prevent my entering. He was amused at the oaths and abusive epithets  with which they had accompanied their defense of the gate, and at last  said to me, \"After all, my dear Constant, you should not be angry with  them; they were only obeying orders. They are brave men, on whom I can  rely.\" The truth is, the Consular Guard was at this period no less  devoted than it has been since as the Imperial Guard. At the first rumor  of the great risk which the First Consul had run, all the soldiers of  that faithful band had gathered spontaneously in the court of the  Tuileries.    After this melancholy catastrophe, which carried distress into all  France, and mourning into so many families, the entire police were  actively engaged in searching for the authors of the plot. The dwelling  of the First Consul was first put under surveillance, and we were  incessantly watched by spies, without suspecting it. All our walks, all  our visits, all our goings and comings, were known; and attention was  especially directed to our friends, and even our liaisons. But such was  the devotion of each and all to the person of the First Consul, such was  the affection that he so well knew how to inspire in those around him,  that not one of the persons attached to his service was for an instant  suspected of having a hand in this infamous attempt. Neither at this  time, nor in any other affair of this kind, were the members of his  household ever compromised; and never was the name of the lowest of his  servants ever found mixed up in criminal plots against a life so valued  and so glorious.    The minister of police suspected the Royalists of this attempt; but the  First Consul attributed it to the Jacobins, because they were already  guilty, he said, of crimes as odious. One hundred and thirty of the most  noted men of this party were transported on pure suspicion, and without  any form of trial.

Va fino a un luogo,      dove accende un gran fuoco      in mezzo del bosco,      alla fontana del _Corvo_.      Si mette la mano in seno,      guarda il velo,      e il cuor gli si spezza.        Â«Cari amici, guerrieri miei,      prodi figli di draghi,[48]      statevi pur qui a banchettare      e all'ombra sdrajatevi.

Â«Buona fortuna, o giovinotto mio bravo!Â»        Â«Che rechi? onde vieni?Â»        Â«Se brami, o signore, saperlo,      ad altri potrebbe esser bene,      ma Ã¨ per te mala cosa ed amara.      Tuo padre Ã¨ cÃ³rso,      il paese tutto ha posto a soqquadro,      finchÃ© ha trovato la tua bella,      e l'ha gettata      in uno stagno largo e profondo.Â»        Â«Tieni, o bravo, il mio cavallo,      e menalo al padre mio.      Se chiedesse ov'io sia,      digli ch'io sono andato      giÃº in riva allo stagno,      e nell'acqua mi son buttato      a ritrovare la fanciulla che amai.Â»      III.        Il padre si tira dietro tutto il paese;      asciuga lo stagno,      e i due giovani trova      insieme abbracciati,      su la rena gialla prostesi;      ambedue nel volto sereni,      talchÃ© vivi parevano.      Il re allora si pente;      nella seta gli avvolge,      in chiesa li fa portare,      e in due casse li mette,      casse belle da imperatore,      sopravi lettere latine:      e lui ha murato      presso l'altare ad oriente,      lei nell'atrio a occidente.      E dalla tomba di lui Ã¨ uscito, o fratello,[50]      un abete verde coperto d'ellera,      che pende su la chiesa;      e da quella di lei una piccola vite      fiorita pieghevole,      che dall'alba alla sera      alla chiesa si Ã¨ abbarbicata      e con l'abete confusa.      Tuona, o Signore, e fulmina;      tuona su chi tronca a mezzo      il dolce e fervido amore      d'un giovine e d'una fanciulla.    Alle piante cresciute su la sepoltura di amanti infelici, una canzone  italo-albanese (_La ballata di Angelina_) attribuisce virtÃº miracolosa:  Â«AndÃ² a nascere un cipresso--lÃ  dove sepolto era il garzone;--e spuntÃ²  una vite bianca--lÃ  dove sepolta era la fanciulla.--Per sotto l'alto  cipresso i feriti passavano:--prendevano foglie di cipresso,--e alle  ferite le mettevano.--E sotto quella vite bianca--i malati andavano a  passare;--prendevano gli acini della vite bianca,--e l'infermitÃ   guarivano.Â» CAMARDA, _Appendice al saggio di grammatol. comparata su la  lingua alban._, Prato, 1866, p. 113. In una delle piÃº antiche ballate  inglesi (_Fair Margaret and sweet William_), dal cuore della fanciulla  spunta un rosajo, e da quel dell'amante una rosa selvatica, che, al  solito, cresciuti, s'intrecciano insieme; e il canto finisce con una  scappatella burlesca: Â«Poi venne il cherico della parrocchia,--per dir  la veritÃ ,--e disgraziatamente li tagliÃ²;--altrimenti vi sarebbero  ancora.Â»    Quanto all'origine di questa leggiadra fantasia popolare, convien  ricercarla nella storia di Tristano e d'Isotta, che nel medio evo si  propagÃ² per quasi tutta l'Europa, e che procede visibilmente dalle  metamorfosi mitologiche. Vedi BOSSERT, _La litterature allemande au  Moyen-Age_, Paris, 1882, p. 298.--Ma dal cuore e sulle tombe di amanti  sventurati, non soltanto sorgono fiori arboscelli ed altre maggiori  piante. A mo' d'esempio, in certa novellina popolare russa raccolta  dall'ATANASIEFF e citata dal prof. PRATO (_Quattro novelline popolari  livornesi_, ecc., Spoleto, 1880, p. 105), su la tomba di due fanciulli  barbaramente sgozzati dalla zia, spuntano un ramo d'oro e uno d'argento.  NÃ© si puÃ² legger senza ridere un canto serbo, che nel luogo dove una  giovinetta innocente morÃ­ per man del fratello, fa saltar fuori di  schianto non giÃ  fiori od alberi od arbusti, ma una chiesa a dirittura:  non dice (peccato!) se col bravo suo campanile o no.    A proposito di piante venute su da cadaveri o da sepolture, vedi  MARMIER, _LÃ©gendes des plantes et des oiseaux_, Paris, 1882, p. 34-35;  DE GUBERNATIS, _La mythologie des plantes, ou les lÃ©gendes du rÃ¨gne  vÃ©gÃ©tal_, Paris, 1878, t.

DE LA VILLEMARQUÃ‰, _Barzaz-Breiz_, Paris, 1846, I, p. 45. Â«Le couplet de  la chanson de Malborough,Â» dice l'ARBAUD, I. p.

Concluderemo piuttosto  col DE GUBERNATIS, op. e t. cit., p. 160, in nota: Â«On veut absolument  revivre aprÃ¨s la mort, et l'arbre est le symbole _le plus vivant de la  vie_.Â»]    [Nota 47: In altro canto: _Sette fratelli come sette abeti_. Anco dai  Greci moderni l'uomo Ã¨ paragonato spesso ad un albero alto e diritto,  come sarebbe il cipresso. Una canzoncina nuziale albanese, raccolta da  G. JUBANY (Trieste, 1871, p. 109), dice della sposa: _Ha la statura come  il cipresso_. Nel _Libro dei re_ di Firdusi questo paragone Ã¨  frequentissimo.--_Homme grand comme un pin du dÃ¨sert, comme un sapin du  marais._ Vedi _Kalevala, runo 48_ (traduz. di L. LÃ‰OUZON LE DUC) Paris,  1879. I Serbi rassomigliano ad un pino il guerriero: un vÃ²cero cÃ²rso  ancora inedito: _Lu me altu quantu un pinu!--lu me minutu cipressu!_  Polipete e LeontÃ¨o sono da Omero paragonati a due querce. (_Iliade,  XII_.)]    [Nota 48: Orig. _Zmeu_. Forse non c'Ã¨ cosa che piÃº sovente dei draghi  s'incontri nei canti e nelle fiabe popolari rumeni; ai quali un  guerriero, un uomo valoroso Ã¨ un drago; drago un cavallo forte e veloce  al corso. Anche ai Serbi, drago (_Zmei_) vale uomo fiero, prode,  terribile: anzi, nella mitologia slava, col suddetto nome si designa  spesso qualche iddio, per es., quello del fuoco. Draghi e dragonesse  hanno i Bulgari, presso i quali mutansi talvolta in orsi in pesci ed in  uomini. DOZON, _Chansons popul. bulgares inedites_, ediz. citata.  Altrove occorrono in vece uomini trasformati in dragoni. DULAURIER, _Les  chants pop. de l'ArmÃ©nie_, in _Revue des deux mondes_, 1 avril 1852. In  un canto (_pesma_) della Macedonia, Alessandro il grande Ã¨ generato da  un drago; ed anche un'antica favola greca, riferita da Luciano, lo disse  nato da un serpente, come di un serpente fu, tanti secoli dopo, creduto  prole l'albanese Giorgio Castriota. DOZON, _Rapports sur une mission  littÃ©raire en Macedonie_, Paris, 1873, p. 42. G. MASPERO (_Contes pop.  de l'Egypte ancienne_, Paris, 1882, p. 42) fa menzione d'altro drago che  parla veramente bene ed Ã¨ signore d'un'isola incantata. Certa fiaba  calmucca narra d'un drago ch'Ã¨ una pasta di zucchero. Sono alquanto  simili ai draghi le _KoutchÃ©dras_ degli Albanesi, le quali hanno un po'  dell'uomo ed un po' della bestia. Circa i draghi e le dragonesse delle  fiabe e novelline pop. ital. e specialmente siciliane, vedasi la dotta  prefaz. di G. PITRÃ‰ al vol.

Certa sera ad un torrito          castel venne a scavalcar,          sospettando, a qualche indizio,          che il suo caro fosse lÃ .            Â«Ãˆ qui, dite, il cavaliere?          esso qui deve abitar.Â»            E una dama le rispose          con discreto e bel parlar:            Â«Non Ã¨ in casa il cavaliere,          ma non puÃ² molto indugiar:          se la pellegrina ha fretta,          glie lo manderÃ² a chiamar.Â»            Non avea finito ancora,          e fu visto ritornar:            Â«Che ci fate qua, signora?          a che mai veniste qua?Â»            Â«Per amor d'un cavaliere          mi son messa a viaggiar.
