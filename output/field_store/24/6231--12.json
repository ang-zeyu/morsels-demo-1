But not even by day is he shy, for he will  allow any quietly disposed person to approach near enough to him to  watch the movement of his bill and heaving chest. At the approach of  night he becomes silent, generally discontinuing his song about an  hour before the Thrush, and resuming it between ten and eleven. It is  a disputed point whether the Nightingale's song should be considered  joyous or melancholy. This must always remain a question of taste. My  own opinion is, that the piteous wailing note which is its most  characteristic nature, casts a shade of sadness as it were over the  whole song, even those portions which gush with the most exuberant  gladness. I think, too, though my assertion may seem a barbarous one,  that if the Nightingale's song comprised the wailing notes alone, it  would be universally shunned as the most painfully melancholy sound in  nature. From this, however, it is redeemed by the rapid transition,  just when the anguish of the bird has arrived at such a pitch as to be  no longer supportable, to a passage overflowing with joy and gladness.  In the first or second week of June he ceases his song altogether. His  cataract of sweet sounds is exhausted, and his only remaining note is  a harsh croak exactly resembling that of a frog, or the subdued note  of a raven, _wate-wate_ or _cur-cur_. On one occasion only I have  heard him in full song so late as the fourth week in June: but this  probably was a bird whose first nest had been destroyed, and whose  song consequently had been retarded until the hatching of a second  brood. From this time until the end of August, when he migrates  eastward, he may often be observed picking up grubs, worms, and ants'  eggs on the garden lawn, or under a hedge in fields, hopping from  place to place with an occasional shake of the wings and raising of  the tail, and conspicuous whenever he takes one of his short flights  by his chestnut brown tail-coverts.    The Nightingale's nest is constructed of dead leaves, principally of  the oak, loosely put together and placed on the ground under a bush.  Internally it is lined with grass, roots, and a few hairs. It contains  four or five eggs of a uniform olive-brown.       [3] This is the opinion of Gilbert White.        SUB-FAMILY ACCENTORINA      THE HEDGE SPARROW     ACCENTOR MODULARIS        Crown of the head ash colour, with brown streaks; sides of the      neck, throat, and breast, bluish grey; bill strong and broad      at base; wing-coverts and feathers on the back reddish brown,      with a tawny spot in the centre; middle wing-coverts tipped      with yellowish white; lower tail-coverts brown, with a whitish      border; middle of abdomen white. Length five and a half      inches. Eggs greenish blue, without spots.    Inveterate custom has so attached the name of Hedge Sparrow to this  bird, that in spite of all the efforts of ornithologists to convince  the world that it is no sparrow at all (a hard-beaked, grain-eating  bird), but a true warbler, it is still more frequently called by its  popular name than by any of those that have been suggested. The  gentle, innocent, confiding, little brown bird, which creeps like a  mouse through our garden flower-beds, picks up a meagre fare in our  roads and lanes, builds its nest in our thorn hedges, and though dingy  itself, lays such brilliant blue eggs, has been known to us from our  infancy as a 'Hedge Sparrow', and we decline any innovation: the name  is a time-honoured one, and no one will mistake us. Hedge Accentor,  Hedge Warbler, and Shuffle-wing, are names open to those who prefer  them, but we adhere to the old-fashioned designation of Hedge Sparrow.  This bird is a genuine Warbler, and one of the few belonging to the  tribe who remain with us all the winter; we should suppose, indeed,  that he never wandered far from the place of his birth. At all seasons  his habits and food appear to be the same. All day long he is  shuffling about on the ground picking up minute atoms, whether seeds  or insects, who knows? Every day, nearly all the year round, he  repairs at intervals to the nearest hedge, where he sings a song, soft  and gentle like himself; and every evening, when the Blackbird rings  his curfew bell, he fails not to respond with his drowsy _cheep_,  _cheep_, as he repairs to the bush he has selected for his night's  rest. Very early in spring, before his brother warblers have arrived  from the south, he has chosen his mate, built his snug nest, and too  probably commenced a second; for unsuspicious in nature, he does not  retire to solitary places for this purpose, and the leafless hedges  but ill conceal his labours from the peering eyes of all-destroying  ploughboys. Such are nearly all his \"short and simple annals\". He  quarrels with no one, he achieves no distinction, throwing no one into  ecstasies with his song, and stealing no one's fruit; unobtrusive and  innocent, he claims no notice, and dreads no resentment; and so,  through all the even tenor of his way, he is, without knowing it, the  favourite of children, and of all the good and gentle.        SUB-FAMILY SYLVIINA      THE WHITETHROAT     SYLVIA CINA%REA        Head ash-grey; rest of the upper parts grey, tinged with rust      colour; wings dusky, the coverts edged with red; lower parts      white, faintly tinged on the breast with rose colour; tail      dark brown, the outer feather white at the tip and on the      outer web, the next only tipped with white. _Female_ without      the rose tint on the breast, but with the upper plumage more      decidedly tinged with red; feet brown. Length five inches and      a half; breadth eight and a half. Eggs greenish white, thickly      spotted with reddish and greenish brown. Young, leaving nest,      differ very little from adult birds.    The Whitethroat is in England the most common of all the migratory  warblers, and is generally diffused. It is essentially a hedge-bird,  neither taking long flights nor resorting to lofty trees. Early in May  it may be detected in a hawthorn or other thick bush, hopping from  twig to twig with untiring restlessness, frequently descending to the  ground, but never making any stay, and all the while incessantly  babbling with a somewhat harsh but not unpleasant song, composed of  numerous rapid and short notes, which have but little either of  variety or compass. Occasionally it takes a short flight along the  hedge, generally on the side farthest from the spectator, and proceeds  to another bush a few yards on, where it either repeats the same  movements, or perches on a high twig for a few seconds. From time to  time it rises into the air, performing curious antics and singing all  the while. Its short flight completed, it descends to the same or an  adjoining twig; and so it seems to spend its days. From its habit of  creeping through the lower parts of hedges, it has received the  popular name of 'Nettle-creeper'. From the grey tone of its plumage,  it is in some districts of France called '_Grisette_', and in others,  from its continuous song, '_Babillarde_', names, however, which are  popularly applied without distinction to this species and the next.  While singing it keeps the feathers of its head erected, resembling in  this respect the Blackcap and several of the other warblers. Though  not naturally a nocturnal musician, it does not, like most other  birds, when disturbed at night, quietly steal away to another place of  shelter, but bursts into repeated snatches of song, into which there  seems to be infused a spice of anger against the intruder.[4] Its food  consists of insects of various kinds; but when the smaller fruits  begin to ripen, it repairs with its young brood to our gardens, and  makes no small havoc among raspberries, currants, and cherries. It  constructs its nest among brambles and nettles, raised from two to  three feet from the ground, of bents and the dry stems of herbs, mixed  with cobweb, cotton from the willow, bits of wool, and horsehair. It  usually lays five eggs.       [4] This night song is rarely heard except in the months of May         and June.        THE LESSER WHITETHROAT     SYLVIA CURRAsCA        Head and lore dark ash-grey; rest of the upper parts greyish      ash, tinged with brown; wings brown, edged with ash-grey; tail      dusky, outer feather as in the last, the two next tipped with      white; lower parts pure silvery white; feet deep lead colour.      Length five inches and a quarter. Eggs greenish white, spotted      and speckled, especially at the larger end, with ash and      brown.    Gilbert White in his charming history says, \"A rare, and I think a new  little bird frequents my garden, which I have very great reason to  think is the Pettichaps; it is common in some parts of the kingdom;  and I have received formerly dead specimens from Gibraltar. This bird  much resembles the Whitethroat, but has a more white, or rather  silvery breast and belly; is restless and active, like the  Willow-wrens, and hops from bough to bough, examining every part for  food; it also runs up the stems of the crown-imperials, and, putting  its head into the bells of those flowers, sips the liquor which stands  in the nectarium of each petal. Sometimes it feeds on the ground like  the Hedge-Sparrow, by hopping about on the grass plots and mown  walks.\" The little bird of which the amiable naturalist gives so  interesting a description, was, there is little doubt, that which is  now called the Lesser Whitethroat, then a 'new bird', inasmuch as it  had not been made a distinct species, and necessarily a 'rare bird',  not because a few only visited Britain, but because,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3810"],[0,"The Man-Eaters of Tsavo, and Other East African Adventures (#13)"],[1,"dead. When he asked me if I expected to get the  second lion soon, I well remember his half-doubting smile as I rather  too confidently asserted that I hoped to bag him also in the course of  a few days.    As it happened, there was no sign of our enemy for about ten days after  this, and we began to hope that he had died of his wounds in the bush.  All the same we still took every precaution at night, and it was  fortunate that we did so, as otherwise at least one more victim would  have been added to the list. For on the night of December 27, I was  suddenly aroused by terrified shouts from my trolley men, who slept in  a tree close outside my boma, to the effect that a lion was trying to  get at them. It would have been madness to have gone out, as the moon  was hidden by dense clouds and it was absolutely impossible to see  anything more than a yard in front of one; so all I could do was to  fire off a few rounds just to frighten the brute away. This apparently  had the desired effect, for the men were not further molested that  night; but the man-eater had evidently prowled about for some time, for  we found in the morning that he had gone right into every one of their  tents, and round the tree was a regular ring of his footmarks.    The following evening I took up my position in this same tree, in the  hope that he would make another attempt. The night began badly, as,  while climbing up to my perch I very nearly put my hand on a venomous  snake which was lying coiled round one of the branches. As may be  imagined, I came down again very quickly, but one of my men managed to  despatch it with a long pole. Fortunately the night was clear and  cloudless, and the moon made every thing almost as bright as day. I  kept watch until about 2 a.m., when I roused Mahina to take his turn.  For about an hour I slept peacefully with my back to the tree, and then  woke suddenly with an uncanny feeling that something was wrong. Mahina,  however, was on the alert, and had seen nothing; and although I looked  carefully round us on all sides, I too could discover nothing unusual.  Only half satisfied, I was about to lie back again, when I fancied I  saw something move a little way off among the low bushes. On gazing  intently at the spot for a few seconds, I found I was not mistaken. It  was the man-eater, cautiously stalking us.    The ground was fairly open round our tree, with only a small bush every  here and there; and from our position it was a most fascinating sight  to watch this great brute stealing stealthily round us, taking  advantage of every bit of cover as he came. His skill showed that he  was an old hand at the terrible game of man-hunting: so I determined to  run no undue risk of losing him this time. I accordingly waited until  he got quite close--about twenty yards away--and then fired my .303 at  his chest. I heard the bullet strike him, but unfortunately it had no  knockdown effect, for with a fierce growl he turned and made off with  great long bounds. Before he disappeared from sight, however, I managed  to have three more shots at him from the magazine rifle, and another  growl told me that the last of these had also taken effect.    We awaited daylight with impatience, and at the first glimmer of dawn  we set out to hunt him down. I took a native tracker with me, so that I  was free to keep a good look-out, while Mahina followed immediately  behind with a Martini carbine. Splashes of blood being plentiful, we  were able to get along quickly; and we had not proceeded more than a  quarter of a mile through the jungle when suddenly a fierce warning  growl was heard right in front of us. Looking cautiously through the  bushes, I could see the man-eater glaring out in our direction, and  showing his tusks in an angry snarl. I at once took careful aim and  fired. Instantly he sprang out and made a most determined charge down  on us. I fired again and knocked him over; but in a second he was up  once more and coming for me as fast as he could in his crippled  condition. A third shot had no apparent effect, so I put out my hand  for the Martini, hoping to stop him with it. To my dismay, however, it  was not there. The terror of the sudden charge had proved too much for  Mahina, and both he and the carbine were by this time well on their way  up a tree. In the circumstances there was nothing to do but follow  suit, which I did without loss of time: and but for the fact that one  of my shots had broken a hind leg, the brute would most certainly have  had me. Even as it was, I had barely time to swing myself up out of his  reach before he arrived at the foot of the tree.    When the lion found he was too late, he started to limp back to the  thicket; but by this time I had seized the carbine from Mahina, and the  first shot I fired from it seemed to give him his quietus, for he fell  over and lay motionless. Rather foolishly, I at once scrambled down  from the tree and walked up towards him. To my surprise and no little  alarm he jumped up and attempted another charge. This time, however, a  Martini bullet in the chest and another in the head finished him for  good and all; he dropped in his tracks not five yards away from me, and  died gamely, biting savagely at a branch which had fallen to the ground.    By this time all the workmen in camp, attracted by the sound of the  firing, had arrived on the scene, and so great was their resentment  against the brute who had killed such numbers of their comrades that it  was only with the greatest difficulty that I could restrain them from  tearing the dead body to pieces. Eventually, amid the wild rejoicings  of the natives and coolies, I had the lion carried to my boma, which  was close at hand. On examination we found no less than six bullet  holes in the body, and embedded only a little way in the flesh of the  back was the slug which I had fired into him from the scaffolding about  ten days previously. He measured nine feet six inches from tip of nose  to tip of tail, and stood three feet eleven and a half inches high;  but, as in the case of his companion, the skin was disfigured by being  deeply scored all over by the boma thorns.    The news of the death of the second \"devil\" soon spread far and wide  over the country, and natives actually travelled from up and down the  line to have a look at my trophies and at the \"devil-killer\", as they  called me. Best of all, the coolies who had absconded came flocking  back to Tsavo, and much to my relief work was resumed and we were never  again troubled by man-eaters. It was amusing, indeed, to notice the  change which took place in the attitude of the workmen towards me after  I had killed the two lions. Instead of wishing to murder me, as they  once did, they could not now do enough for me, and as a token of their  gratitude they presented me with a beautiful silver bowl, as well as  with a long poem written in Hindustani describing all our trials and my  ultimate victory. As the poem relates our troubles in somewhat quaint  and biblical language, I have given a translation of it in the  appendix. The bowl I shall always consider my most highly prized and  hardest won trophy. The inscription on it reads as follows:--      SIR,--We, your Overseer, Timekeepers, Mistaris and Workmen, present you  with this bowl as a token of our gratitude to you for your bravery in  killing two man-eating lions at great risk to your own life, thereby  saving us from the fate of being devoured by these terrible monsters  who nightly broke into our tents and took our fellow-workers from our  side. In presenting you with this bowl, we all add our prayers for your  long life, happiness and prosperity. We shall ever remain, Sir, Your  grateful servants,    Baboo PURSHOTAM HURJEE PURMAR,    Overseer and Clerk of Works,      on behalf of your Workmen.        Dated at Tsavo, January 30, 1899.      Before I leave the subject of \"the man-eaters of Tsavo,\" it may be of  interest to mention that these two lions possess the distinction,  probably unique among wild animals, of having been specifically  referred to in the House of Lords by the Prime Minister of the day.  Speaking of the difficulties which had been encountered in the  construction of the Uganda Railway, the late Lord Salisbury said:--    \"The whole of the works were put a stop to for three weeks because a  party of man-eating lions appeared in the locality and conceived a most  unfortunate taste for our porters. At last the labourers entirely  declined to go on unless they were guarded by an iron entrenchment. Of  course it is difficult to work a railway under these conditions, and  until we found an enthusiastic sportsman to get rid of these lions, our  enterprise was seriously hindered.\"    Also, The Spectator of March 3, 1900, had an article entitled \"The  Lions that Stopped the Railway,\" from which the following extracts are  taken:--    \"The parallel to the story of the lions which stopped the rebuilding of  Samaria must occur to everyone, and if the Samaritans had quarter as  good cause for their fears as had the railway coolies, their wish to  propitiate the local deities is easily understood. If the whole body of  lion anecdote, from the days of the Assyrian Kings till the last year  of the nineteenth century, were collated and brought together, it would  not equal in tragedy or atrocity, in savageness or in sheer insolent  contempt for man, armed or unarmed, white or black, the story of these  two beasts.    \"To what a distance the whole story carries us back, and how impossible  it becomes to account for the survival of primitive man against this  kind of foe! For fire--which has hitherto been regarded as his main  safeguard against the carnivora--these cared nothing. It is curious  that the Tsavo lions were not killed by poison, for strychnine is  easily used, and with effect. (I may mention that poison was tried, but  without effect. The poisoned carcases of"]]]
