[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3291"],[0,"John Marshall and the Constitution, a Chronicle of the Supreme Court (#13)"],[1," Washington, Marshall had, though  with some apparent reluctance, ordered the release of Bollmann and  Swartwout, two of Burr's tools, from the custody of the Federal  authorities. Alluding in his present opinion to his reason for his  earlier action, he wrote: \"More than five weeks have elapsed since the  opinion of the Supreme Court has declared the necessity of proving the  fact, if it exists. Why is it not proved? To the executive government  is entrusted the important power of prosecuting those whose crimes may  disturb the public repose or endanger its safety. It would be easy, in  much less time than has intervened since Colonel Burr has been alleged  to have assembled his troops, to procure affidavits establishing the  fact.\"    This sharp criticism brought an equally sharp retort from Jefferson, to  which was added a threat. In a private letter of the 20th of April, the  President said: \"In what terms of decency can we speak of this? As if an  express could go to Natchez or the mouth of the Cumberland and return in  five weeks, to do which has never taken less than twelve!... But all the  principles of law are to be perverted which would bear on the favorite  offenders who endeavor to overturn this odious republic!... All this,  however, will work well. The nation will judge both the offender and  judges for themselves.... They will see then and amend the error in our  Constitution which makes any branch independent of the nation.... If  their [the judges] protection of Burr produces this amendment, it will  do more good than his condemnation would have done.\" Already the case  had taken on the color of a fresh contest between the President and the  Chief Justice.    On the 22d of May the United States Court for the Fifth Circuit and the  Virginia District formally convened, with Marshall presiding and Judge  Grin at his side. On the same day the grand jury was sworn, with John  Randolph as foreman, and presently began taking testimony. Unluckily for  the prosecution, the proceedings now awaited the arrival of Wilkinson  and the delay was turned to skillful use by the defense to embroil  further the relations between the Chief Justice and the President. With  this end in view, Burr moved on the 9th of June that a subpoena duces  tecum issue to Jefferson requiring him to produce certain papers,  including the famous cipher letter to Wilkinson. The main question  involved, of course, was that of the right of the Court under any  circumstances to issue a subpoena to the President, but the abstract  issue soon became involved with a much more irritating personal one.  \"This,\" said Luther Martin, who now found himself in his element, \"this  is a peculiar case, sir. The President has undertaken to prejudge  my client by declaring that 'of his guilt there is no doubt.' He has  assumed to himself the knowledge of the Supreme Being himself and  pretended to search the heart of my highly respected friend. He has  proclaimed him a traitor in the face of the country which has rewarded  him. He has let slip the dogs of war, the hellhounds of persecution, to  hunt down my friend. And would this President of the United States, who  has raised all this absurd clamor, pretend to keep back the papers which  are wanted for this trial, where life itself is at stake?\"    Wirt's answer to Martin was also a rebuke to the Court. \"Do they [the  defense] flatter themselves,\" he asked, \"that this court feel political  prejudices which will supply the place of argument and innocence on the  part of the prisoner? Their conduct amounts to an insinuation of the  sort. But I do not believe it.... Sir, no man, foreigner or citizen, who  hears this language addressed to the court, and received with all the  complacency at least which silence can imply, can make any inference  from it very honorable to the court.\" These words touched Marshall's  conscience, as well they might. At the close of the day he asked  counsel henceforth to \"confine themselves to the point really before the  court\"--a request which, however, was by no means invariably observed  through the following days.    A day or two later Marshall ruled that the subpoena should issue,  holding that neither the personal nor the official character of the  President exempted him from the operation of that constitutional clause  which guarantees accused persons \"compulsory process for obtaining  witnesses\" in their behalf. The demand made upon the President, said the  Chief Justice, by his official duties is not an unremitting one, and,  \"if it should exist at the time when his attendance on a court is  required, it would be sworn on the return of the subpoena and would  rather constitute a reason for not obeying the process of the court than  a reason against its being issued.\" Jefferson, however, neither obeyed  the writ nor swore anything on its return, though he forwarded some of  the papers required to Hay, the district attorney, to be used as the  latter might deem best. The President's argument was grounded on the  mutual independence of the three departments of Government; and he asked  whether the independence of the Executive could long survive \"if the  smaller courts could bandy him from pillar to post, keep him constantly  trudging from North to South and East to West, and withdraw him entirely  from his executive duties?\" The President had the best of the encounter  on all scores. Not only had Marshall forgotten for the nonce the  doctrine he himself had stated in Marbury vs. Madison regarding the  constitutional discretion of the Executive, but what was worse still, he  had forgotten his own discretion on that occasion. He had fully earned  his rebuff, but that fact did not appreciably sweeten it.    On the 24th of June the grand jury reported two indictments against  Burr, one for treason and the other for misdemeanor. The former charged  that Burr, moved thereto \"by the instigation of the devil,\" had on  the 10th of December previous levied war against the United States  at Blennerhassett's island, in the county of Wood, of the District of  Virginia, and had on the day following, at the same place, set in motion  a warlike array against the city of New Orleans. The latter charged that  a further purpose of this same warlike array was an invasion of Mexico.  Treason not being a bailable offense, Burr had now to go to jail, but,  as the city jail was alleged to be unhealthful, the Court allowed him to  be removed to quarters which had been proffered by the Governor of the  State in the penitentiary just outside the city. Burr's situation here,  writes his biographer, \"was extremely agreeable. He had a suite of rooms  in the third story, extending one hundred feet, where he was allowed  to see his friends without the presence of a witness. His rooms were so  thronged with visitors at times as to present the appearance of a levee.  Servants were continually arriving with messages, notes, and inquiries,  bringing oranges, lemons, pineapples, raspberries, apricots, cream,  butter, ice, and other articles--presents from the ladies of the city.  In expectation of his daughter's arrival, some of his friends in  town provided a house for her accommodation. The jailer, too, was all  civility.\" * Little wonder that such goings-on are said to have \"filled  the measure of Jefferson's disgust.\"       * Parton's \"Life and Times of Aaron Burr\" (13th Edition, N.Y.,  1880), p. 479.      The trial itself opened on Monday, the 3d of August. The first business  in hand was to get a jury which would answer to the constitutional  requirement of impartiality--a task which it was soon discovered was  likely to prove a difficult one. The original panel of forty-eight men  contained only four who had not expressed opinions unfavorable to  the prisoner, and of these four all but one admitted some degree of  prejudice against him. These four were nevertheless accepted as jurors.  A second panel was then summoned which was even more unpromising in its  make-up, and Burr's counsel began hinting that the trial would have to  be quashed, when Burr himself arose and offered to select eight out of  the whole venire to add to the four previously chosen. The offer was  accepted, and notwithstanding that several of the jurors thus obtained  had publicly declared opinions hostile to the accused, the jury was  sworn in on the 17th of August.    At first glance Burr's concession in the selecting of a jury seems  extraordinary. But then, why should one so confident of being able to  demonstrate his innocence fear prejudice which rested on no firmer basis  than ignorance of the facts? This reflection, however, probably played  small part in Burr's calculations, for already he knew that if the  contemplated strategy of his counsel prevailed the case would never come  before the jury.    The first witness called by the prosecution was Eaton, who was prepared  to recount the substance of numerous conversations he had held with  Burr in Washington in the winter of 1805-6, in which Burr had gradually  unveiled to him the treasonable character of his project. No sooner,  however, was Eaton sworn than the defense entered the objection that  his testimony was not yet relevant, contending that in a prosecution  for treason the great material fact on which the merits of the entire  controversy pivots was the overt act, which must be \"AN OPEN ACT OF  WAR\"; just as in a murder trial the fact of the killing, the corpus  delicti, must be proved before any other testimony was relevant, so in  the pending prosecution, said they, no testimony was admissible until  the overt act had been shown in the manner required by the Constitution.    The task of answering this argument fell to Wirt, who argued, and  apparently with justice, that the prosecution was free to introduce its  evidence in any order it saw fit, provided only that the evidence was  relevant to the issue raised by the indictment, and that if an overt  act"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32934"],[0,"The Young Colonists: A Story of the Zulu and Boer Wars (#13)"],[1," it.  There was on the plateau a large number of cattle, part the  property of Umbelleni's men, but the great majority spoil taken in  raids.  It seemed to the boys that an attack could scarcely be  successful.  The sides of the mountains were extremely precipitous,  covered with bush, and contained large numbers of caves.  There was but  one path up which mounted men could ride; this was about hallway along  the west side, the hill being a much greater length from north to south  than from east to west.  Up the southern extremity of the plateau was a  path by which footmen could descend to the plain, but it was exceedingly  steep and altogether impracticable for cavalry; a handful of men should  have been able to hold the position against an army.    Colonel Wood having heard of the large quantity of cattle concealed on  the Zlobani Mountain had determined to attack it, and at three o'clock  in the morning of the 27th of March a cavalry party started.  It  consisted of 150 mounted infantry; the Frontier Light Horse, 125;  Raaff's Troop, 50; Piet-Uys' Boer Contingent, 50; Wetherby's Horse, 80;  Schermbrucker's Horse, 40;--a total of 495 men.  They were commanded by  Colonel Russell, and Colonel Wood was himself to join them in the  evening.  The party was a picked one, all being well mounted and good  rifle-shots.    The track led across a rough sandy country with deep nullahs, and  thickly covered with trees and bush.  At five o'clock they halted for  half an hour, and then again advanced.  After five miles' travelling  across a very rough country they came out into a large cultivated flat,  which terminated in a long, dark, winding gorge, black with bush and  skirted by precipices of sandstone and granite.  They turned into this  and followed a rivulet until they came to the end of the gorge, where  they discovered a steep path which seemed cut out of the solid rock, and  was only wide enough for one horseman to pass.  After three quarters of  an hour's climbing they gained the summit.  The country was wild in the  extreme.  The plateau upon which they found themselves extended for  seven or eight miles.  Huge masses of scrub and boulders, peaks,  terraces, and ledges of rock appeared everywhere, while caves and  immense fissures formed retreats for the cattle.  It was now late in the  afternoon, and the force bivouacked for the night, having brought with  them three days' provisions.  At seven in the evening Colonel Wood  joined them with his staff, eight mounted men of the 50th regiment and  six natives under Untongo, a son of Pongo, a friendly chief.  Untongo  had by some means obtained information that seven strong regiments had  marched from Ulundi seven days before, and was most anxious that the  column should return to Kambula.    Colonel Wood, however, could not carry out this advice, for Colonels  Buller and Wetherby and Piet-Uys, with their commands, who were in  front, had moved forward a long distance, and a retreat now would leave  them to be surrounded and cut off.  The troops lay down and slept, and  at half-past three o'clock again prepared to advance.  Distant shots  were heard, showing that Colonel Buller was attacked, and just as the  party was setting off, Colonel Wetherby with his troopers rode in,  having in the night got separated from Buller's men in the wild and  broken country.  As the troops advanced they came here and there across  the bodies of Zulus, showing that Buller had had to fight his way.  Captain Ronald Campbell ascended a rock and scanned the country with his  glass.  Far away, almost in the centre of the gigantic and apparently  inaccessible cliff of Zlobani, the remains of Buller's column could be  seen slowly advancing, driving some dark masses of cattle and Zulus  before them.    Colonel Wetherby obtained permission to lead his men on at once to  Buller's assistance, while Colonel Wood followed with the remainder of  the force.  Wetherby moved by a terribly difficult path to the right,  while Wood kept to what seemed the main track.  About half a mile  further the latter came on a party of 200 Zulus, armed with rifles;  these crossed in front of him, taking an occasional shot at the leading  files of the party, who on account of the difficulties of the road were  compelled to dismount and lead their horses.  Their object was evidently  to cut off Wetherby's troop from the main column.  Lieutenant Lysons,  leaving the column, reconnoitred the ground, and found that Wetherby's  party was already divided from them by a deep and impassable ravine, at  the bottom of which was the pathway by which Buller had made his way to  the summit of the cliff.  A strong party of Zulus were seen faraway in  front, working as if to cut off Buller's horse.  It was clear that there  was nothing to do but to press forward in hopes that the line taken by  Wetherby and that which the main column was following would come  together.    At this moment a heavy fire was opened by a party of the enemy from a  narrow ledge of rock a hundred yards above them.  Untongo and two of his  men guided a party of eight marksmen to a still higher point, and their  fire speedily drove off the Zulus.  Half an hour's march brought Wood  upon Wetherby's track, and high above them to the right the rear of  Buller's column could be seen.  No more unsuitable ground for the  operation of mounted men could be found; perpendicular rocks rose in all  directions, while steep precipices fell away at their feet.  Killed and  wounded horses were seen at every turn of the road, showing how stoutly  the enemy had held their ground, and how difficult an operation Buller  had performed.  Sending fifty men to work upon the right flank and  endeavour to take the Zulus in the rear, Colonel Wood kept his men for a  few moments under cover of a friendly ledge of rocks, to take breath and  look to their rifles, girths, and ammunition, and then pressed rapidly  forward and joined the Border Horse.    The scene was now most exciting.  The firing was almost continuous, and  the yells of the savages rose from every rock and bush, mingled with the  loud cheers of Buller's men far up in front, as they saw the column  approaching to their aid.  The ground was now more level and practicable  for riding, and Colonel Wood mounted his horse and, accompanied by his  own little escort of a dozen men and the Border Horse under Colonel  Wetherby himself, with his gallant boy, aged fifteen, who was fighting  by his side, galloped forward for the front, leaving Colonel Russell in  command of the column.  When within a hundred paces of the summit of the  cliff a rain of fire opened upon their front and flank from a mass of  Zulus firing from caves, crevices, and behind enormous boulders.  From  one cave to the right front an excessively heavy fire was kept up, and  Colonel Wetherby dashed at this with his men just as Colonel Wood's  horse staggered from a deep assegai wound in the chest.  At the same  moment a native from behind a boulder fired at that officer at ten  paces' distance; the bullet missed him and Lieutenant Lloyd rode at the  man, but fell, shot through the head.  Colonel Wood and Captain Ronald  Campbell rode forward to cover his body.  Two more Zulus fired at the  same instant and the colonel's horse fell dead.  Colonel Wetherby's men  were hotly engaged at close quarters with the Zulus, and were unable to  join the colonel.  Captain Campbell, Lieutenant Lysons, and the eight  90th men of the escort rushed at the opening.  Captain Campbell fell,  shot through the head, but the rest dashed forward.    There was a movement in the cave and a sudden shout in English of \"Come  on!\" and as the little band dashed in and fell upon the Zulus they saw,  to their astonishment, two English boys, armed with assegais, attacking  these in the rear.  In another minute the Zulus were all cut down, and  the party returned to Colonel Wood.    On the previous afternoon Zulu scouts had arrived at Zlobani with the  news that an English column was on its way towards it.  Messengers were  despatched to Umbelleni's kraal, and at night his force there came to  the assistance of those at Zlobani.  Early in the morning the boys  proceeded with a number of Zulus to the edge of the plateau, and were  placed with eight of their guards in a cave.  From its mouth they  watched anxiously the events of the day.    Colonel Buller's party had struck upon the right road, and after hard  fighting gained the summit of the cliff.  Here a great quantity of  cattle were collected, and these were sent off in charge of a body of  friendly natives, which accompanied the force.  This column in the  advance had not passed near the cave in which the boys were placed.  Their hearts beat high as they saw Colonel Wood's column suddenly turn  off from the line which Buller had followed, and make straight for it.  Their excitement grew higher and higher as the conflict increased in  vigour.    Soon the Zulus in the cave were at work.  When Captain Campbell charged  forward with his handful of men, Dick and Tom exchanged a glance.  They  stood quiet until it was evident that the English attack would be pushed  home; then, as the men of the 90th, led by Lysons, dashed at the  entrance of the cavern, the boys seized two assegais and each pinned one  of the crouching Zulus to the ground.  Before the others could turn  round upon them Lysons and his men were among them.    The fire of Buller's men from above drove the Zulus from their  hiding-places.  But Colonel Wood, finding it impossible to make his way  up at this point, moved round at the foot of the rocks, to try and find  the point at which Buller had ascended the cliff.  Before doing so,  however, the bodies of Captain Campbell and Lieutenant Lloyd were  carried down the hill, and buried in a hastily-made grave.  As, carrying  their wounded men, the little party made their way to the foot of the  cliff, Untongo, who had been"]]]
