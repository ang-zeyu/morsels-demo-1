[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2634"],[0,"The Evolution of Theology: an Anthropological Study (#13)"],[1," ethical and intellectual criticism of theology once more recommenced,  and arrived at a temporary resting-place in the confessions of the  various reformed Protestant sects in the sixteenth century; almost all  of which, as soon as they were strong enough, began to persecute those  who carried criticism beyond their own limit. But the movement was not  arrested by these ecclesiastical barriers, as their constructors fondly  imagined it would be; it was continued, tacitly or openly, by Galileo,  by Hobbes, by Descartes, and especially by Spinoza, in the seventeenth  century; by the English Freethinkers, by Rousseau, by the French  Encyclopaedists, and by the German Rationalists, among whom Lessing  stands out a head and shoulders taller than the rest, throughout the  eighteenth century; by the historians, the philologers, the Biblical  critics, the geologists, and the biologists in the nineteenth century,  until it is obvious to all who can see that the moral sense and  the really scientific method of seeking for truth are once more  predominating over false science. Once more ethics and theology are  parting company.    It is my conviction that, with the spread of true scientific culture,  whatever may be the medium, historical, philological, philosophical, or  physical, through which that culture is conveyed, and with its necessary  concomitant, a constant elevation of the standard of veracity, the end  of the evolution of theology will be like its beginning--it will cease  to have any relation to ethics. I suppose that, so long as the human  mind exists, it will not escape its deep-seated instinct to personify  its intellectual conceptions. The science of the present day is as  full of this particular form of intellectual shadow-worship as is the  nescience of ignorant ages. The difference is that the philosopher who  is worthy of the name knows that his personified hypotheses, such as  law, and force, and ether, and the like, are merely useful symbols,  while the ignorant and the careless take them for adequate expressions  of reality. So, it may be, that the majority of mankind may find the  practice of morality made easier by the use of theological symbols. And  unless these are converted from symbols into idols, I do not see  that science has anything to say to the practice, except to give an  occasional warning of its dangers. But, when such symbols are dealt with  as real existences, I think the highest duty which is laid upon men of  science is to show that these dogmatic idols have no greater value than  the fabrications of men's hands, the stocks and the stones, which they  have replaced.          FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 1: Even the most sturdy believers in the popular theory that the proper  or titular names attached to the books of the Bible are those of their  authors will hardly be prepared to maintain that Jephthah, Gideon, and  their colleagues wrote the book of Judges. Nor is it easily admissible  that Samuel wrote the two books which pass under his name, one of which  deals entirely with events which took place after his death. In fact, no  one knows who wrote either Judges or Samuel, nor when, within the range  of 100 years, their present form was given to these books.]    [Footnote 2: My citations are taken from the Revised Version, but for Lord and  God I have substituted Jahveh and Elohim.]    [Footnote 3: I need hardly say that I depend upon authoritative Biblical critics,  whenever a question of interpretation of the text arises. As Reuss  appears to me to be one of the most learned, acute, and fair-minded of  those whose works I have studied, I have made most use of the commentary  and dissertations in his splendid French edition of the Bible. But  I have also had recourse to the works of Dillman, Kalisch, Kuenen,  Thenius, Tuch, and others, in cases in which another opinion seemed  desirable.]    [Footnote 4: See \"Divination,\" by Hazoral, _Journal of Anthropology,_ Bombay,  vol. i.

For Jephthah, Chemosh is obviously as real  a personage as Jahveh.]    [Footnote 6: For example: \"My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire,  of a sweet savour to me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due  season\" (Num. xxviii. 2).]    [Footnote 7: In 2 Samuel xv. 27 David says to Zadok the priest, \"Art thou not a  seer?\" and Gad is called David's seer.]    [Footnote 8: This would at first appear to be inconsistent with the use of the  word \"prophetess\" for Deborah.

In China, a corresponding reverence for  parents is part and parcel of ancestor-worship; so in ancient Rome and  in Greece (where parents were even called [secondary and earthly]).  The fifth commandment, as it stands, would be an excellent compromise  between ancestor-worship and monotheism. The larger hereditary share  allotted by Israelitic law to the eldest son reminds one of the  privileges attached to primogeniture in ancient Rome, which were closely  connected with ancestor-worship.

Sometimes when a jay is hidden in a copse, he utters a low, scolding  sputter, that seems to express the very quintessence of disgust.  It is  simply his way of telling you what he thinks of a man who goes prowling  about without leave in the precincts of the birds.    Have you ever heard the jay's brief musical roulade?  It is only a wisp  of melody, rarely rich and suggestive, heard a moment, then gone.  You  know something sweet has passed by, but something so brief and elusive  that you scarcely know what it was.  Long after it has dropped on your  ear, it continues to haunt your memory, and you try again and again to  reproduce it, but in vain.  It has a kind of gurgling quality, as if  the bird were pressing his notes through an aqueous lyre, if such a  conception is possible.  Besides, I have, on more than one occasion,  heard a jay warble a soft, reserved little lay that was continued for  many minutes.  It sounded very like the song of the brown thrasher,  much modulated and partly uttered under its breath--a sort of flowing,  rythmical melody.    A question that disturbs all bird lovers more or less is this: Does the  fine white vest of the jay cover a bad heart?  Is he really a thief, a  nest robber, or even worse, a cannibal, in plumes?  May the guardian  spirit of all feathered folk forbid that I should blacken the  reputation of any bird, yet honesty compels me to give an affirmative  answer to the foregoing question.  I hasten, however, to say that I do  not believe he is as black as he has been painted by some observers,  who seem to delight in making out a verdict of capital guilt against  him.  Although a predatory bird, he is not engaged all the time in  bloodthirsty pursuits, but only while his young are in the nest  clamoring for food.  What are some of the proofs of his vandalism?  I  will mention a few of them.    First, almost all the small birds make uncompromising war upon him,  especially in the breeding season, and many of them show signs of dire  distress when he goes near their nests.  They often utter pitiful  cries, droop their wings, and the bravest of them dash at him savagely,  giving him many a cuff on the head and back.  The wood pewee and the  kingbird succeed, I think, in driving him away; but the vireos and  warblers, being so much smaller, suffer greatly from his depredations.  If there were no real cause for it, these birds would not be filled  with panic and rage on account of the jay's presence.  There is strong  presumptive evidence that they know him for an outlaw only too well.    The following incident will furnish positive proof of the jay's  cannibalistic proclivities: One spring my little boy brought home from  the country a young house wren, thinking it would make a delightful  pet.  It was quite well fledged, but its short tail and white mouth  border proclaimed the tenderness of its youth.  Fearing that the little  thing could not be reared by hand, as it refused all our proffered  tidbits, and chirped continually for its parents, I persuaded the lad  to give it its freedom.  A mother wren living on our premises seemed  inclined to adopt the little waif, and we decided to put it under her  care.  No sooner was the youngling let out of the cage than it flew to  the side of the house and began to scramble up the brick wall.  It had  a hard tug, but at length succeeded in reaching a resting place on a  window-shutter of the second story.    Presently the mother wren heard its calls and paid it a visit; but  instead of feeding it, she seemed very anxious to drive it away,  knowing, no doubt, that there were predaceous enemies in the  neighborhood.  In her attempts to drive it into hiding, she pecked it  on the head and in the mouth.  Then she dropped down into a thicket and  secured a green worm, with which she flew up to the chirping waif's  perch; but I could not make out that she fed the birdling, though she  thrust the worm toward its open mouth.  Soon after she had gone off the  second time, the little bird clambered around the corner of the wall to  the lower side of the house, where it rested a while on a narrow shelf.    All this time my boy and I were watching it intently.  Suddenly a blue  jay came flying over from one of the trees of an adjacent yard, moving  in a rapid, stealthy way.  First it plunged into an apple tree at the  corner of the house; then, before I could collect my wits enough to  know what was happening, it darted over to the brick wall, seized the  little wren with its bill, and bore it off.  The mother wren followed,  uttering a pitiful chatter, while the little victim called loudly for  help.  The blue kidnapper darted to a tree in my neighbor's yard, where  he put his booty under his claw on a limb, holding it by one slender  leg, while its body dangled below.  Hoping still to rescue the little  captive, I sprang over into the adjacent yard with a loud shout and  much waving of my hands; but my vigorous efforts only caused the jay to  pick up the wren in its bill and continue its flight, and neither wren  nor jay was seen by me again.  This incident furnishes unimpeachable  testimony against the character of the blue-coated Robin Hood.  There  was no faltering or hesitancy in his conduct, but he seized and carried  off his little victim as if he were to the manner born, and had become  hardened by practice in depredations of the sort.    A farmer once related the following incident to me: A pair of chipping  sparrows had built a nest in a bush in his front yard.  One day after  the little ones had arrived, he heard a distressed chirping coming from  the parent birds, and on going to the front yard, he caught a blue jay  in the act of picking a callow bantling from the chippie's nest.  Holding it in his bill, the jay flew across the field with his prize,  and presently returned and bore off a second nestling.  By this time  the farmer's ire was aroused; he bolted into the house and secured his  shotgun, and when the marauding jay came back on the third trip on  robbery intent, the man brought him to the ground with a shot that  ended his career.    Yet the jay is not wholly bad--indeed, not even half bad.  Before me  lies a valuable pamphlet entitled \"The Blue Jay and His Food,\" written  by F. E. L. Beal, Assistant Biologist of the Department of Agriculture  at Washington, whose researches have converted him into something of an  apologist for our blue gentleman in feathers.  He dissected the  stomachs of 292 jays, collected during every month of the year in  twenty-two states, the District of Columbia, and Canada.  After stating  that mineral substances in the stomachs examined averaged over 14 per  cent of the total contents, Mr. Beal says:    \"The real food is composed of 24.3 per cent of animal matter and 75.7  per cent of vegetable matter, or a trifle more than three times as much  vegetable as animal.  The animal food is chiefly made up of insects,  with a few spiders, myriapods, snails, and small vertebrates, such as  fish, salamanders, tree frogs, mice, and birds.  Everything was  carefully examined which might by any possibility indicate that birds  or eggs had been eaten, but remains of birds were found in only two,  and the shells of small birds' eggs in only three of the 292 stomachs.  One of these, taken on February tenth, contained the bones, claws, and  a little skin of a bird's foot.  Another, taken on June twenty-fourth,  contained the remains of a young bird.  The three stomachs with bird's  eggs were collected in June, August, and October, respectively.  The  shell eaten in October belonged to the egg of some larger bird like the  ruffed grouse and, considering the time of year, was undoubtedly merely  an empty shell from an old nest.  Shells of eggs which were identified  as those of domesticated fowls, or some bird of equal size, were found  in eleven stomachs, collected at irregular times during the year.  This  evidence would seem to show that more eggs of domesticated fowls than  of wild birds are destroyed, but it is much more probable that these  shells were obtained from refuse heaps about farm-houses.\"    Mr. Beal's dissections are very significant, proving that the jay is  not only not so destructive of eggs and bantlings as was supposed, but  also that he destroys many noxious insects, and is, therefore, a bird  of real economic value.  The great bulk of his insect diet consists of  beetles, grasshoppers, and caterpillars, with a few bugs, wasps, and  flies, and an occasional spider and myriapod.  The average of insect  food for the whole year was 23 per cent, varying from less than 1 per  cent in January to over 66 per cent in August, and it is gratifying to  know that predaceous beetles and tent caterpillars form a large part of  the jay's bill of fare.    His demands upon domesticated fruits and grains are comparatively  light.  He cares more for acorns and mast than for corn.  The last he  does not greatly relish, but eats it chiefly when the snow covers his  favorite food.  It is a little surprising that he occasionally varies  his diet with fish, salamanders, tree frogs, mice, and shrews.  Mr.  Beal's conclusion is put in the following sentence, which closes his  valuable monograph: \"In fact, the examination of nearly three hundred  stomachs shows that the blue jay does far more good than harm.\"    An important question, therefore, from more than one point of view is:  Should we ever kill the blue jay?  Perhaps as sensible an answer to  that question as can be given is this: We should by no means engage in  a war of extermination upon the jays, but it might be wise, when they  become too abundant, to thin out their numbers somewhat by shooting  some of them or driving them away.  It can scarcely be denied that if  they are permitted to thrive without hindrance, and grow to large"]]]
