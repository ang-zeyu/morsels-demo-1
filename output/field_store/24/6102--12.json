Hat in hand he  approached every possible patron with his story of certain success  if only supplied with funds with which to complete his ship. A  stock company with a capital of $225,000 of which he contributed one  half, soon found its resources exhausted and retired from the  speculation. Appeals to the Emperor met with only cold indifference.  An American millionaire newspaper owner, resident in Europe, sent  contemptuous word by his secretary that he \"had no time to bother  with crazy inventors.\" That was indeed the attitude of the business  classes at the moment when the inventors of dirigibles were on the  very point of conquering the obstacles in the way of making the  navigation of air a practical art. A governmental commission at  Berlin rejected with contempt the plans which Zeppelin presented in  his appeal for support. Members of that commission were forced to an  about-face later and became some of the inventor's sturdiest  champions. But in his darkest hour the government failed him, and  the one friendly hand stretched out in aid was that of the German  Engineers' Society which, somewhat doubtfully, advanced some funds  to keep the work in operation.    [Illustration: (C) U. & U.    _A British \"Blimp\"._]    With this the construction of the first Zeppelin craft was begun.  Though there had been built up to the opening of the war twenty-five  \"Zeps\"--nobody knows how many since--the fundamental type was not  materially altered in the later ones, and a description of the first  will stand for all. In connection with this description may be noted  the criticisms of experts some of which proved only too well  founded.    The first Zeppelin was polygonal, 450 feet long, 78 broad, and 66  feet high. This colossal bulk, equivalent to that of a 7500-ton  ship necessary to supply lifting power for the metallic frame,  naturally made her unwieldy to handle, unsafe to leave at rest,  outside of a sheltering shed, and a particularly attractive target  for artillery in time of war. Actual action indeed proved that to be  safe from the shells of anti-aircraft guns, the Zeppelins were  forced to fly so high that their own bombs could not be dropped with  any degree of accuracy upon a desired target.    The balloon's frame is made of aluminum, the lightest of metals, but  not the least costly. A curious disadvantage of this construction  was made apparent in the accident which destroyed _Zeppelin IV._  That was the first of the airships to be equipped with a full  wireless outfit which was used freely on its flight. It appeared  that the aluminum frame absorbed much of the electricity generated  for the purpose of the wireless. The effect of this was two-fold. It  limited the radius of operation of the wireless to 150 miles or  less, and it made the metal frame a perilous storehouse of  electricity. When _Zeppelin IV._ met with a disaster by a storm  which dragged it from its moorings, the stored electricity in her  frame was suddenly released by contact with the trees and set fire  to the envelope, utterly destroying the ship.    The balloon frame was divided into seventeen compartments, each of  which held a ballonet filled with hydrogen gas. The purpose of this  was similar to the practice of dividing a ship's hulls into  compartments. If one or more of the ballonets, for any reason, were  injured the remainder would keep the ship afloat. The space between  the ballonets and the outer skin was pumped full of air to keep the  latter taut and rigid. Moreover it helped to prevent the radiation  of heat to the gas bags from the outer envelope whose huge expanse,  presented to the sun, absorbed an immense amount of heat rays.    Two cars were suspended from the frame of the Zeppelin, forward and  aft, and a corridor connected them. A sliding weight was employed  to raise or depress the bow. In each car of the first Zeppelin was  a sixteen-horse-power gasoline motor, each working two screws, with  four foot blades, revolving one thousand times a minute. The engines  were reversible, thus making it possible to work the propellers  against each other and aid materially in steering the ship. Rudders  at bow and stern completed the navigating equipment.    In the first Zeppelins, the corridor connecting the two cars was  wholly outside the frame and envelope of the car. Later the perilous  experiment was tried of putting it within the envelope. This  resulted in one of the most shocking of the many Zeppelin disasters.  In the case of the ship _L-II._, built in 1912, the corridor became  filled with gas that had oozed out of the ballonets. At one end or  the other of the corridor this gas, then mixed with air, came in  contact with fire,--perhaps the exhaust of the engines,--a violent  explosion followed while the ship was some nine hundred feet aloft,  and the mass of twisted and broken metal, with the flaming envelope,  fell to the ground carrying twenty-eight men, including members of  the Admiralty Board, to a horrible death.    But to return to the first Zeppelin. Her trial was set for July 2,  1900, and though the immediate vicinity of the floating hangar was  barred to the public by the military authorities, the shores and  surface of the lake were black with people eager to witness the  test. Boats pulled out of the wide portal the huge cigar-shaped  structure, floating on small rafts, its polished surface of pegamoid  glittering in the sun. As large as a fair-sized ocean steamship, it  looked, on that little lake dotted with pleasure craft, like a  leviathan. Men were busy in the cars, fore and aft. The mooring  ropes were cast off as the vessel gained an offing, and ballast  being thrown out she began to rise slowly. The propellers began to  whir, and the great craft swung around breasting the breeze and  moved slowly up the lake. The crowd cheered. Count von Zeppelin,  tense with excitement, alert for every sign of weakness watched his  monster creation with mingled pride and apprehension. Two points  were set at rest in the first two minutes--the lifting power was  great enough to carry the heaviest load ever imposed upon a balloon  and the motive power was sufficient to propel her against an  ordinary breeze. But she was hardly in mid-air when defects became  apparent. The apparatus for controlling the balancing weight got out  of order. The steering lines became entangled so that the ship was  first obliged to stop, then by reversing the engines to proceed  backwards. This was, however, a favourable evidence of her handiness  under untoward circumstances. After she had been in the air nearly  an hour and had covered four or five miles, a landing was ordered  and she dropped to the surface of the lake with perfect ease. Before  reaching her shed, however, she collided with a pile--an accident in  no way attributable to her design--and seriously bent her frame.    The story told thus baldly does not sound like a record of glorious  success. Nevertheless not Count Zeppelin alone but all Germany was  wild with jubilation. _Zeppelin I._ had demonstrated a principle;  all that remained was to develop and apply this principle and  Germany would have a fleet of aerial dreadnoughts that would force  any hostile nation to subjection. There was little or no discussion  of the application of the principle to the ends of peace. It was as  an engine of war alone that the airship appealed to the popular  fancy.    But at the time that fancy proved fickle. With a few repairs the  airship was brought out for another test. In the air it did all that  was asked for it, but it came to earth--or rather to the surface of  the lake--with a shock that put it out of commission. When Count  Zeppelin's company estimated the cost of further repairs it gave a  sigh and abandoned the wreck. Thereupon the pertinacious inventor  laid aside his tools, got into his old uniform, and went out again  on the dreary task of begging for further funds.    It was two years before he could take up again the work of  construction. He lectured, wrote magazine articles, begged, cajoled,  and pleaded for money. At last he made an impression upon the  Emperor who, indeed, with a keen eye for all that makes for military  advantage, should have given heed to his efforts long before. Merely  a letter of approval from the all-powerful Kaiser was needed to turn  the scale and in 1902 this was forthcoming. The factories of the  empire agreed to furnish materials at cost price, and sufficient  money was soon forthcoming to build a second ship. This ship took  more than two years to build, was tested in January, 1906, made a  creditable flight, and was dashed to pieces by a gale the same  night!    The wearisome work of begging began again. But this time the  Kaiser's aid was even more effectively given and in nine months  _Zeppelin III._ was in the air. More powerful than its predecessors  it met with a greater measure of success. On one of its trials a  propeller blade flew off and penetrated the envelope, but the ship  returned to earth in safety. In October, 1906, the Minister of War  reported that the airship was extremely stable, responded readily to  her helm, had carried eleven persons sixty-seven miles in two hours  and seventeen minutes, and had made its landing in ease and safety.  Accepted by the government \"No. III.\" passed into military service  and Zeppelin, now the idol of the German people, began the  construction of \"No. IV.\"    That ship was larger than her predecessors and carried a third  cabin for passengers suspended amidships. Marked increase in the  size of the steering and stabling planes characterized the  appearance of the ship when compared with earlier types. She was at  the outset a lucky ship. She cruised through Alpine passes into  Switzerland, and made a circular voyage carrying eleven passengers  and flying from Friedrichshaven to Mayence and back via Basle,  Strassburg, Mannheim, and Stuttgart. The voyage occupied "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3005"],[0,"Tom Swift and His Airship (#13)"],[1,"\"Of course,\" answered the young inventor, though the motherly  housekeeper had not done this since he was a little chap. She had to  stand on a soap box, which Eradicate brought in order to reach Tom's  face, and, when she had kissed him she said:    \"Oh, I'm so worried! I just know you'll be killed, risking your lives  in that terrible airship!\"    \"Ha! Not a very cheerful view to take, madam,\" observed Mr. Damon.  \"Don't hold that view, I beg of you. Bless my eyelashes, but you'll see  us coming home, covered with glory and star dust.\"    \"I'm sure I hope so,\" answered Mrs. Baggert, laughing a little in spite  of herself.    The last ropes were cast off. Good-bys were shouted as the airship shot  into the air, and Mr. Sharp started the motor, to warm it up before the  propellers were thrown into gear. The twenty cylinders began exploding  with a terrific racket, as the muffler was open, and Tom, looking down,  saw Boomerang awaken with a jump. The mule was so frightened that he  started off on a dead run, swinging the rickety, old wagon along behind  him.    Eradicate Sampson, who had been feeling his muscle since he discovered  what he thought was his marvelous strength, saw what was happening.    \"Whoa, dar, Boomerang!\" he shouted. Then, as the tailboard of the wagon  swung past him, he reached out and grabbed it. Perhaps he thought he  could bring the runaway mule up standing, but, if he did, he was  grievously disappointed. Boomerang pulled his master along the gravel  walk, and kept running in spite of Eradicate's command to \"whoa, dar!\"    It might have gone hard with him, had not Garret Jackson, the engineer,  running in front of Boomerang, caught the animal. Eradicate picked  himself up, and gazed sadly at his arms. The navigators of the air  could not hear what he said, but what he thought was evident to them.    Then, as Mr. Sharp deadened the explosions of the powerful motor. Tom,  looking at a gauge, noted that their height was seven hundred feet.  \"High enough!\" called Mr. Sharp, and it was time, for Mr. Damon, in  spite of his resolution, was getting pale.    The gas was shut off, the propellers thrown into gear, and, with a rush  the Red Cloud shot toward the south, passing over the Swift homestead,  and high above the heads of the crowd that had gathered to witness the  start. The eventful voyage of the air had begun.          Chapter 12    Some Startling News      \"Well, there they go,\" remarked Mrs. Baggert to Mr. Swift, as she  strained her eyes toward the sky, against the blue of which the airship  was now only a large, black ball.    \"Yes, and a fine start they made,\" replied the inventor. \"I almost wish  I had accompanied them, but I must not stop work on my submarine  invention.\"    \"I do hope nothing will happen to them,\" went on the housekeeper. \"I  declare, though, I feel just as if something was going to happen.\"    \"Nervousness, pure nervousness,\" commented Mr. Swift. \"Better take a  little--er--I suppose catnip tea would be good.\"    \"Catnip tea! The very idea!\" exclaimed Mrs. Baggert. \"That shows how  much you know about nervousness, Mr. Swift,\" and she seemed a little  indignant.    \"Ha! Hum! Well, maybe catnip tea wouldn't be just the thing. But don't  worry about Tom. I'm sure he can look after himself. As for Mr. Sharp  he has made too many ascensions to run into any unnecessary danger.\"    \"Nervous!\" went on the housekeeper, who seemed to resent this state  being applied to her. \"I'm sure I'm not half as nervous as that Mr.  Damon. He gives me the fidgets.\"    \"Of course. Well, I must get back to my work,\" said the inventor. \"Ah,  are you hurt, Eradicate?\" he went on, as the colored man came back,  driving Boomerang, who had been stopped just before reaching the road.    \"No, Mistah Swift, I ain't exactly damaged, but mah feelin's am suah  hurted.\"    \"How's that?\"    \"Well, I thought I had growed strong in de night, when I lifted dat  airship, but when I went to stop mah mule I couldn't do it. He won't  hab no respect fo' me now.\"    \"Oh, I wouldn't let that worry me,\" commented Mr. Swift, and he  explained to Eradicate how it was that he had so easily lifted the end  of the buoyant ship, which weighed very little when filled with gas.    The colored man proceeded with his work of whitewashing, the inventor  was in his library, puzzling over tables of intricate figures, and Mrs.  Baggert was in the kitchen, sighing occasionally as she thought of Tom,  whom she loved almost as a son, high in the air, when two men came up  the walk, from the street, and knocked at the side door. Mrs. Baggert,  who answered the summons, was somewhat surprised to see Chief of Police  Simonson and Constable Higby.    \"They probably came to see the airship start,\" she thought, \"but  they're too late.\"    \"Ah, good morning, Mrs. Baggert,\" greeted the chief. \"Is Mr. Swift and  his son about this morning?\"    \"Mr. Swift is in his library, but Tom is gone.\"    \"He'll be back though, won't he?\" asked Constable Higby  quickly--anxiously, Mrs. Baggert thought.    \"Oh, yes,\" she replied. \"He and--\"    \"Just take us to see Mr. Swift,\" interrupted the chief, with a look of  caution at his aide. \"We'll explain matters to him.\"    Wondering what could be the mission of the two officers, Mrs. Baggert  led them to the library.    \"It's queer,\" she thought, \"that they don't ask something about the  airship. I suppose that was what they came for. But maybe it's about  the mysterious men who robbed Mr. Swift.\"    \"Ah, gentlemen, what can I do for you?\" asked the inventor, as he rose  to greet the officials.    \"Ahem, Mr. Swift. Ahem--er--that is--well, the fact is, Mr. Swift,\"  stammered the chief, \"we have come upon a very painful errand.\"    \"What's that?\" cried Tom's father. \"I haven't been robbed again, have  I?'    \"There has been a robbery committed,\" spoke the constable quickly.    \"But you are not the victim,\" interposed the chief.    \"I'm glad of that,\" said Mr. Swift.    \"Where is your son, Tom?\" asked the head of the Shopton police force,  sharply.    \"What do you want with him?\" inquired the inventor, struck by some  strange tone in the other's voice.    \"Mr. Swift,\" went on the chief, solemnly, \"I said we came upon a very  painful errand. It is painful, as I have known Tom since he was a  little lad. But I must do my duty, no matter how painful it is. I have  a warrant for the arrest of your son, Thomas Swift, and I have come to  serve it. I need not tell you that it is your duty to give him up to  us--the representatives of the law. I call upon you to produce your  son.\"    Mr. Swift staggered to his feet.    \"My son! You have come to arrest my son?\" he stammered.    The chief nodded grimly.    \"Upon what charge?\" faltered the father.    \"On a charge of breaking into the Shopton National Bank last night, and  stealing from the vault seventy-five thousand dollars in currency!\"    \"Seventy-five thousand dollars! Tom accused of robbing the bank!\"  faltered Mr. Swift.    \"That is the charge, and we've come to arrest him,\" broke in Constable  Higby.    \"Where is he?\" added the chief.    \"This charge is false! Absolutely false!\" shouted the aged inventor.    \"That may be,\" admitted the chief shaking his head. \"But the charge has  been made, and we hold the warrant. The courts will settle it. We must  now arrest Tom. Where is he?\"    \"He isn't here!\" cried Mr. Swift, and small blame to him if there was a  note of triumph in his voice. \"Tom sailed away not half an hour ago in  the airship Red Cloud! You can't arrest him!\"    \"He's escaped!\" shouted the constable. \"I told you, chief, that he was  a slippery customer, and that we'd better come before breakfast!\"    \"Dry up!\" commanded the chief testily. \"So he's foiled us, eh? Run away  when he knew we were coming? I think that looks like guilt, Mr. Swift.\"    \"Never!\" cried the inventor. \"Tom would never think of robbing the  bank. Besides, he has all the money he wants. The charge is  preposterous! I demand to be confronted with the proof.\"    \"You shall be,\" answered Chief Simonson vindictively. \"If you will come  to the bank you can see the rifled vault, and hear the testimony of a  witness who saw your son with burglar tools in his possession last  night. We also have a warrant for Mr. Wakefield Damon. Do you know  anything of him?\"    \"He has gone with my son in the airship.\"    \"Ha! The two criminals with their booty have escaped together!\" cried  the chief. \"But we'll nab them if we have to scour the whole country.  Come on, Higby! Mr. Swift, if you'll accompany me to the bank, I think  I can give you all the proof you want,\" and the officials, followed by  the amazed and grief-stricken inventor, left the house.          Chapter 13    Mr. Damon In Danger      The sensations of the voyagers in the airship, who meanwhile, were  flying along over the country surrounding Shopton, were not very  different than when they had undertaken some trial flights. In fact Mr.  Damon was a little disappointed after they had waved their farewells to  Mr. Swift and Mrs. Baggert.    \"I declare I'm not at all nervous,\" he remarked, as he sat in an easy  chair in the enclosed car or cabin, and looked down at the earth  through the plate-glass windows in the floor.    \"I thought you'd be all right once we got started,\" commented Mr.  Sharp. \"Do you think you can stand going a trifle higher?\"    \"Try it,\" suggested the eccentric man. \"Bless my watch chain, but, as I  said, I might as well die this way as any other. Hitting a cloud-bank  is easier than trying to climb a tree on a motorcycle, eh, Tom?\"    \"Very much so, Mr. Damon,\" conceded the young inventor, with a laugh.    \"Oh, we'll not attempt any cloud heights for a day or two,\" went on Mr.  Sharp. \"I want you, to gradually get used to the rarefied atmosphere,  Mr. Damon. Tom and I are getting to be old hands at it.  But, if you  think you can stand it, I'll go up about a thousand feet higher.\"    \"Make it two"]]]
