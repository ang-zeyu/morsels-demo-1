Where, Probably, Moliere Obtained His First Idea of the  Bourgeois Gentilhomme.    D'Artagnan found Porthos in the adjoining chamber; but no longer an  irritated Porthos, or a disappointed Porthos, but Porthos radiant,  blooming, fascinating, and chattering with Moliere, who was looking  upon him with a species of idolatry, and as a man would who had not only  never seen anything greater, but not even ever anything so great. Aramis  went straight up to Porthos and offered him his white hand, which lost  itself in the gigantic clasp of his old friend,--an operation which  Aramis never hazarded without a certain uneasiness. But the friendly  pressure having been performed not too painfully for him, the bishop of  Vannes passed over to Moliere.    \"Well, monsieur,\" said he, \"will you come with me to Saint-Mande?\"    \"I will go anywhere you like, monseigneur,\" answered Moliere.    \"To Saint-Mande!\" cried Porthos, surprised at seeing the proud bishop  of Vannes fraternizing with a journeyman tailor. \"What, Aramis, are you  going to take this gentleman to Saint-Mande?\"    \"Yes,\" said Aramis, smiling, \"our work is pressing.\"    \"And besides, my dear Porthos,\" continued D'Artagnan, \"M. Moliere is not  altogether what he seems.\"    \"In what way?\" asked Porthos.    \"Why, this gentleman is one of M. Percerin's chief clerks, and is  expected at Saint-Mande to try on the dresses which M. Fouquet has  ordered for the Epicureans.\"    \"'Tis precisely so,\" said Moliere.    \"Yes, monsieur.\"    \"Come, then, my dear M. Moliere,\" said Aramis, \"that is, if you have  done with M. du Vallon.\"    \"We have finished,\" replied Porthos.    \"And you are satisfied?\" asked D'Artagnan.    \"Completely so,\" replied Porthos.    Moliere took his leave of Porthos with much ceremony, and grasped the  hand which the captain of the musketeers furtively offered him.    \"Pray, monsieur,\" concluded Porthos, mincingly, \"above all, be exact.\"    \"You will have your dress the day after to-morrow, monsieur le baron,\"  answered Moliere. And he left with Aramis.    Then D'Artagnan, taking Porthos's arm, \"What has this tailor done for  you, my dear Porthos,\" he asked, \"that you are so pleased with him?\"    \"What has he done for me, my friend! done for me!\" cried Porthos,  enthusiastically.    \"Yes, I ask you, what has he done for you?\"    \"My friend, he has done that which no tailor ever yet accomplished: he  has taken my measure without touching me!\"    \"Ah, bah! tell me how he did it.\"    \"First, then, they went, I don't know where, for a number of lay  figures, of all heights and sizes, hoping there would be one to suit  mine, but the largest--that of the drum-major of the Swiss guard--was  two inches too short, and a half foot too narrow in the chest.\"    \"Indeed!\"    \"It is exactly as I tell you, D'Artagnan; but he is a great man, or at  the very least a great tailor, is this M. Moliere. He was not at all put  at fault by the circumstance.\"    \"What did he do, then?\"    \"Oh! it is a very simple matter. I'faith, 'tis an unheard-of thing that  people should have been so stupid as not to have discovered this method  from the first. What annoyance and humiliation they would have spared  me!\"    \"Not to mention of the costumes, my dear Porthos.\"    \"Yes, thirty dresses.\"    \"Well, my dear Porthos, come, tell me M. Moliere's plan.\"    \"Moliere? You call him so, do you? I shall make a point of recollecting  his name.\"    \"Yes; or Poquelin, if you prefer that.\"    \"No; I like Moliere best. When I wish to recollect his name, I shall  think of _voliere_ [an aviary]; and as I have one at Pierrefonds--\"    \"Capital!\" returned D'Artagnan. \"And M. Moliere's plan?\"    \"'Tis this: instead of pulling me to pieces, as all these rascals  do--of making me bend my back, and double my joints--all of them low and  dishonorable practices--\" D'Artagnan made a sign of approbation with  his head. \"'Monsieur,' he said to me,\" continued Porthos, \"'a gentleman  ought to measure himself. Do me the pleasure to draw near this glass;'  and I drew near the glass. I must own I did not exactly understand what  this good M. Voliere wanted with me.\"    \"Moliere!\"    \"Ah! yes, Moliere--Moliere. And as the fear of being measured still  possessed me, 'Take care,' said I to him, 'what you are going to do with  me; I am very ticklish, I warn you.' But he, with his soft voice (for  he is a courteous fellow, we must admit, my friend), he with his soft  voice, 'Monsieur,' said he, 'that your dress may fit you well, it must  be made according to your figure. Your figure is exactly reflected in  this mirror. We shall take the measure of this reflection.'\"    \"In fact,\" said D'Artagnan, \"you saw yourself in the glass; but where  did they find one in which you could see your whole figure?\"    \"My good friend, it is the very glass in which the king is used to look  to see himself.\"    \"Yes; but the king is a foot and a half shorter than you are.\"    \"Ah! well, I know not how that may be; it is, no doubt, a cunning way  of flattering the king; but the looking-glass was too large for me.  'Tis true that its height was made up of three Venetian plates of  glass, placed one above another, and its breadth of three similar  parallelograms in juxtaposition.\"    \"Oh, Porthos! what excellent words you have command of. Where in the  word did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary?\"    \"At Belle-Isle. Aramis and I had to use such words in our strategic  studies and castramentative experiments.\"    D'Artagnan recoiled, as though the sesquipedalian syllables had knocked  the breath out of his body.    \"Ah! very good. Let us return to the looking-glass, my friend.\"    \"Then, this good M. Voliere--\"    \"Moliere.\"    \"Yes--Moliere--you are right. You will see now, my dear friend, that I  shall recollect his name quite well. This excellent M. Moliere set to  work tracing out lines on the mirror, with a piece of Spanish chalk,  following in all the make of my arms and my shoulders, all the while  expounding this maxim, which I thought admirable: 'It is advisable that  a dress should not incommode its wearer.'\"    \"In reality,\" said D'Artagnan, \"that is an excellent maxim, which is,  unfortunately, seldom carried out in practice.\"    \"That is why I found it all the more astonishing, when he expatiated  upon it.\"    \"Ah! he expatiated?\"    \"_Parbleu!_\"    \"Let me hear his theory.\"    \"'Seeing that,' he continued, 'one may, in awkward circumstances, or in  a troublesome position, have one's doublet on one's shoulder, and not  desire to take one's doublet off--'\"    \"True,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"'And so,' continued M. Voliere--\"    \"Moliere.\"    \"Moliere, yes. 'And so,' went on M. Moliere, 'you want to draw your  sword, monsieur, and you have your doublet on your back. What do you  do?'    \"'I take it off,' I answered.    \"'Well, no,' he replied.    \"'How no?'    \"'I say that the dress should be so well made, that it will in no way  encumber you, even in drawing your sword.'    \"'Ah, ah!'    \"'Throw yourself on guard,' pursued he.    \"I did it with such wondrous firmness, that two panes of glass burst out  of the window.    \"''Tis nothing, nothing,' said he. 'Keep your position.'    \"I raised my left arm in the air, the forearm gracefully bent, the  ruffle drooping, and my wrist curved, while my right arm, half extended,  securely covered my wrist with the elbow, and my breast with the wrist.\"    \"Yes,\" said D'Artagnan, \"'tis the true guard--the academic guard.\"    \"You have said the very word, dear friend. In the meanwhile, Voliere--\"    \"Moliere.\"    \"Hold! I should certainly, after all, prefer to call him--what did you  say his other name was?\"    \"Poquelin.\"    \"I prefer to call him Poquelin.\"    \"And how will you remember this name better than the other?\"    \"You understand, he calls himself Poquelin, does he not?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"If I were to call to mind Madame Coquenard.\"    \"Good.\"    \"And change _Coc_ into _Poc_, _nard_ into _lin_; and instead of  Coquenard I shall have Poquelin.\"    \"'Tis wonderful,\" cried D'Artagnan, astounded. \"Go on, my friend, I am  listening to you with admiration.\"    \"This Coquelin sketched my arm on the glass.\"    \"I beg your pardon--Poquelin.\"    \"What did I say, then?\"    \"You said Coquelin.\"    \"Ah! true. This Poquelin, then, sketched my arm on the glass; but he  took his time over it; he kept looking at me a good deal. The fact is,  that I must have been looking particularly handsome.\"    \"'Does it weary you?' he asked.    \"'A little,' I replied, bending a little in my hands, 'but I could hold  out for an hour or so longer.'    \"'No, no, I will not allow it; the willing fellows will make it a duty  to support your arms, as of old, men supported those of the prophet.'    \"'Very good,' I answered.    \"'That will not be humiliating to you?'    \"'My friend,' said I, 'there is, I think, a great difference between  being supported and being measured.'\"    \"The distinction is full of the soundest sense,\" interrupted D'Artagnan.    \"Then,\" continued Porthos, \"he made a sign: two lads approached; one  supported my left arm, while the other, with infinite address, supported  my right.\"    \"'Another, my man,' cried he. A third approached. 'Support monsieur by  the waist,' said he. The _garcon_ complied.\"    \"So that you were at rest?\" asked D'Artagnan.    \"Perfectly; and Pocquenard drew me on the glass.\"    \"Poquelin, my friend.\"    \"Poquelin--you are right. Stay, decidedly I prefer calling him Voliere.\"    \"Yes; and then it was over, wasn't it?\"    \"During that time Voliere drew me as I appeared in the mirror.\"    \"'Twas delicate in him.\"    \"I much like the plan; it is respectful, and keeps every one in his  place.\"    \"And there it ended?\"    \"Without a soul having touched me, my friend.\"    \"Except the three _garcons_ who supported you.\"    \"Doubtless; but I have, I think, already explained to you the difference  there is between supporting and measuring.\"    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27600"],[0,"Zoonomia; Or, the Laws of Organic Life, Vol. II (#13)"],[1,"inactivity exists, when the sensorial power in  any part of the system has been previously exhausted by violent stimuli; as  the eyes after long exposure to great light; or the stomach, to repeated  spirituous potation; this may be termed inactivity from exhaustion of  sensorial power. See Sect. XII. 2. 1.    3. But there is a third source of inactivity owing to the deficient  production of sensorial power in the brain; and hence stimuli stronger than  natural are required to produce the accustomed motions of the arterial  system; in this case there is no accumulation of sensorial power produced;  as in the inactivity owing to defect of stimulus; nor any previous  exhaustion of it, as in the inactivity owing to excess of stimulus.    This third kind of inactivity causes many of the diseases of this genus;  which are therefore in general to be remedied by such medicines as promote  a greater production of sensorial power in the brain; as the incitantia,  consisting of wine, beer, and opium, in small repeated quantities; and  secondly of such as simply stimulate the arterial and glandular system into  their natural actions; as small repeated blisters, spices, and essential  oils. And lastly the sorbentia, which contribute to supply the more  permanent strength of the system, by promoting the absorption of  nourishment from the stomach, and intestines; and of the superfluous fluid,  which attends the secretions.    SPECIES.    1. _Febris inirritativa._ Inirritative fever. This is the typhus mitior, or  nervous fever of some writers; it is attended with weak pulse without  inflammation, or symptoms of putridity, as they have been called. When the  production of sensorial power in the brain is less than usual, the pulse  becomes quick as well as weak; and the heart sometimes trembles like the  limbs of old age, or of enfeebled drunkards; and when this force of the  contractions of the heart and arteries is diminished, the blood is pushed  on with less energy, as well as in less quantity, and thence its stimulus  on their sides is diminished in a duplicate ratio. In compressions of the  brain, as in apoplexy, the pulse becomes slower and fuller; for in that  disease, as in natural sleep, the irritative motions of the heart and  arteries are not diminished, volition alone is suspended or destroyed.    If the absorption of the terminations of the veins is not equally impaired  with the force of the heart and arteries, the blood is taken up by the  veins the instant it arrives at their extremities; the capillary vessels  are left empty, and there is less resistance to the current of the blood  from the arteries; hence the pulse becomes empty, as well as weak and  quick; the veins of the skin are fuller than the arteries of it; and its  appearance becomes pale, bluish, and shrunk. See Class II. 1. 3. 1.    When this pulse persists many hours, it constitutes the febris  inirritativa, or typhus, or nervous fever, of some writers; it is attended  with little heat, the urine is generally of a natural colour, though in  less quantity; with great prostration of strength, and much disturbance of  the faculties of the mind. Its immediate cause seems to be a deficient  secretion of the sensorial power from the inaction of the brain; hence  almost the whole of the sensorial power is expended in the performance of  the motions necessary to life, and little of it can be spared for the  voluntary actions of the locomotive muscles, or organs of sense, see Class  I. 2. 5. 3. Its more remote cause may be from a paralysis or death of some  other part of the body; as of the spleen, when a tumour is felt on the left  side, as in some intermittents; or of the kidnies, when the urine continues  pale and in small quantity. Does the revivescence of these affected parts,  or their torpor, recurring at intervals, form the paroxysms of these  fevers? and their permanent revivescence establish the cure? See Class IV.  2. 1. 19.    M. M. Wine and opium in small quantities repeated every three hours  alternately; small repeated blisters; warm but fresh air; sorbentia;  nutrientia; transfusion of blood. Small electric shocks passed through the  brain in all directions. Oxygene air?    2. _Paresis inirritativa._ Inirritative debility. A defective action of the  irritative motions without increase of the frequency of the pulse. It  continues three or four weeks like a fever, and then either terminates in  health, or the patient sinks into one kind of apoplexy, and perishes. Many  symptoms, which attend inirritative fevers, accompany this disease, as cold  hands and feet at periodic times, scurf on the tongue, want of appetite,  muddy urine, with pains of the head, and sometimes vertigo, and vomiting.    This disease differs from the inirritative fever by the pulse not being  more frequent than in health. The want of appetite and of digestion is a  principal symptom, and probably is the cause of the universal debility,  which may be occasioned by the want of nourishment. The vertigo is a  symptom of inirritability, as shewn in Class IV. 2. 1. 16. the muddy urine  is owing to increased absorption from the bladder in consequence of the  diminished cutaneous and cellular absorption, as in anasarca, explained in  Sect. XXIX. 5. 1. and is therefore a consequence of the inirritability of  that part of the system; the foul tongue is owing to an increased  absorption of the thinner part of the mucus in consequence of the general  deficiency of fluid, which should be absorbed by the skin and stomach. The  sickness is owing to decreased action of the stomach, which is probably the  primary disease, and is connected with the vertigo.    M. M. An emetic. Calomel, grains iv. once or twice. Then a blister.  Peruvian bark. Valerian. Columbo. Steel. Opium and wine in small  quantities, repeated alternately every three hours. Small electric  percussions through the stomach.    3. _Somnus interruptus._ Interrupted sleep. In some fevers, where the  inirritability is very great, when the patient falls asleep, the pulse in a  few minutes becomes irregular, and the patient awakes in great disorder,  and fear of dying, refusing to sleep again from the terror of this uneasy  sensation. In this extreme debility there is reason to believe, that some  voluntary power during our waking hours is employed to aid the irritative  stimuli in carrying on the circulation of the blood through the lungs; in  the same manner as we use voluntary exertions, when we listen to weak  sounds, or wish to view an object by a small light; in sleep volition is  suspended, and the deficient irritation alone is not sufficient to carry on  the pulmonary circulation. This explanation seems the most probable one,  because in cases of apoplexy the irritative motions of the arterial system  do not seem to be impaired, nor in common sleep. See Incubus III. 2. 1. 13.    M. M. Opium in very small doses, as three drops of laudanum. A person  should watch the patient, and awaken him frequently; or he should measure  the time between slumber and slumber by a stop-watch, and awaken the  patient a little before he would otherwise awake; or he should keep his  finger on the pulse, and should forcibly awaken him, as soon as it becomes  irregular, before the disorder of the circulation becomes so great as to  disturb him. See Class I. 2. 1. 9. and Sect. XXVII. 2.    4. _Syncope._ Fainting consists in the decreased action of the arterial  system; which is sometimes occasioned by defect of the stimulus of  distention, as after venesection, or tapping for the dropsy. At other times  it arises from great emotions of the mind, as in sudden joy or grief. In  these cases the whole sensorial power is exerted on these interesting  ideas, and becomes exhausted. Thus during great surprise or fear the heart  stops for a time, and then proceeds with throbbing and agitation; and  sometimes the vital motions become so deranged, as never to recover their  natural successive action; as when children have been frightened into  convulsions. See Sect. XII. 7. 1.    Miss ----, a young lady of Stafford, in travelling in a chaise was so  affected by seeing the fall of a horse and postillion, in going down a  hill, though the carriage was not overturned, that she fainted away, and  then became convulsed, and never spoke afterwards; though she lived about  three days in successive convulsions and stupor.    5. _Haemorrhagia venosa._ A bleeding from the capillaries arising from  defect of venous absorption, as in some of those fevers commonly termed  putrid. When the blood stagnates in the cellular membrane, it produces  petechiae from this torpor or paralysis of the absorbent mouths of the  veins. It must be observed, that those people who have diseased livers, are  more liable to this kind of haemorrhages, as well as to the haemorrhagia  arteriosa; the former, because patients with diseased livers are more  subject to paralytic complaints in general, as to hemiplegia, and to  dropsy, which is a paralysis of the lymphatics; and the latter is probably  owing to the delay of the circulation in the vena porta by the torpor of  this hepatic vessel, when the liver is not much enlarged; and to its  pressure on the vena cava, when it is much enlarged.    M. M. Vitriolic acid, opium, steel, bark. Sponge bound on the part. Steel  dissolved in spirit of wine externally. Flour.    6. _Haemorrhois cruenta._ In the bleeding piles the capillary vessels of  the rectum become distended and painful from the defect of the venous  absorption of the part, and at length burst; or the mucous glands are so  dilated as to give a passage to the blood; it is said to observe lunar  periods.    M. M. Venesection, poultices, cathartics, spice, cold bath, and sorbentia.  External compression by applying lint, sponge, or cotton. Internal  compression by applying a bit of candle smeared with mercurial ointment.  Strangulate the tumid piles with a silk string. Cut"]]]
