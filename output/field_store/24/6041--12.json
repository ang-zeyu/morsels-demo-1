A band of  musicians sat up in a gallery at the end of the hall, and filled the  pauses of the riotous feast with the ravishing strains of Lulli and  Destouches.    At the head of the table, first in place as in rank, sat Francois Bigot,  Intendant of New France. His low, well-set figure, dark hair, small,  keen black eyes, and swarthy features full of fire and animation,  bespoke his Gascon blood. His countenance was far from comely,--nay,  when in repose, even ugly and repulsive,--but his eyes were magnets that  drew men's looks towards him, for in them lay the force of a powerful  will and a depth and subtlety of intellect that made men fear, if they  could not love him. Yet when he chose--and it was his usual mood--to  exercise his blandishments on men, he rarely failed to captivate them,  while his pleasant wit, courtly ways, and natural gallantry towards  women, exercised with the polished seductiveness he had learned in the  Court of Louis XV., made Francois Bigot the most plausible and dangerous  man in New France.    He was fond of wine and music, passionately addicted to gambling, and  devoted to the pleasant vices that were rampant in the Court of  France, finely educated, able in the conduct of affairs, and fertile in  expedients to accomplish his ends. Francois Bigot might have saved New  France, had he been honest as he was clever; but he was unprincipled and  corrupt: no conscience checked his ambition or his love of pleasure.  He ruined New France for the sake of himself and his patroness and the  crowd of courtiers and frail beauties who surrounded the King, whose  arts and influence kept him in his high office despite all the efforts  of the Honnetes Gens, the good and true men of the Colony, to remove  him.    He had already ruined and lost the ancient Colony of Acadia, through his  defrauds and malversations as Chief Commissary of the Army, and instead  of trial and punishment, had lately been exalted to the higher and still  more important office of Royal Intendant of New France.    On the right of the Intendant sat his bosom friend, the Sieur Cadet, a  large, sensual man, with twinkling gray eyes, thick nose, and full red  lips. His broad face, flushed with wine, glowed like the harvest moon  rising above the horizon. Cadet had, it was said, been a butcher in  Quebec. He was now, for the misfortune of his country, Chief Commissary  of the Army and a close confederate of the Intendant.    On the left of the Intendant sat his Secretary, De Pean, crafty and  unscrupulous, a parasite, too, who flattered his master and ministered  to his pleasures. De Pean was a military man, and not a bad soldier in  the field; but he loved gain better than glory, and amassed an enormous  fortune out of the impoverishment of his country.    Le Mercier, too, was there, Commandant of Artillery, a brave officer,  but a bad man; Varin, a proud, arrogant libertine, Commissary of  Montreal, who outdid Bigot in rapine and Cadet in coarseness; De Breard,  Comptroller of the Marine, a worthy associate of Penisault, whose  pinched features and cunning leer were in keeping with his important  office of chief manager of the Friponne. Perrault, D'Estebe, Morin, and  Vergor, all creatures of the Intendant, swelled the roll of infamy, as  partners of the Grand Company of Associates trading in New France, as  their charter named them--the \"Grand Company of Thieves,\" as the people  in their plain Norman called them who robbed them in the King's name  and, under pretence of maintaining the war, passed the most arbitrary  decrees, the only object of which was to enrich themselves and their  higher patrons at the Court of Versailles.    The rest of the company seated round the table comprised a number of  dissolute seigneurs and gallants of fashion about town--men of great  wants and great extravagance, just the class so quaintly described by  Charlevoix, a quarter of a century previous, as \"gentlemen thoroughly  versed in the most elegant and agreeable modes of spending money, but  greatly at a loss how to obtain it.\"    Among the gay young seigneurs who had been drawn into the vortex of  Bigot's splendid dissipation, was the brave, handsome Le Gardeur de  Repentigny--a captain of the Royal Marine, a Colonial corps recently  embodied at Quebec. In general form and feature Le Gardeur was a manly  reflex of his beautiful sister Amelie, but his countenance was marred  with traces of debauchery. His face was inflamed, and his dark eyes, so  like his sister's, by nature tender and true, were now glittering with  the adder tongues of the cursed wine-serpent.    Taking the cue from Bigot, Le Gardeur responded madly to the challenges  to drink from all around him. Wine was now flooding every brain, and the  table was one scene of riotous debauch.    \"Fill up again, Le Gardeur!\" exclaimed the Intendant, with a loud and  still clear voice; \"the lying clock says it is day--broad day, but  neither cock crows nor day dawns in the Chateau of Beaumanoir, save at  the will of its master and his merry guests! Fill up, companions all!  The lamplight in the wine-cup is brighter than the clearest sun that  ever shone!\"    \"Bravo Bigot! name your toast, and we will pledge it till the seven  stars count fourteen!\" replied Le Gardeur, looking hazily at the great  clock in the hall. \"I see four clocks in the room, and every one of them  lies if it says it is day!\"    \"You are mending, Le Gardeur de Repentigny! You are worthy to belong to  the Grand Company! But you shall have my toast. We have drank it twenty  times already, but it will stand drinking twenty times more. It is the  best prologue to wine ever devised by wit of man--a woman--\"    \"And the best epilogue too, Bigot!\" interjected Varin, visibly drunk;  \"but let us have the toast, my cup is waiting.\"    \"Well, fill up all, then; and we will drink the health, wealth, and  love by stealth, of the jolliest dame in sunny France--The Marquise de  Pompadour!\"    \"La Pompadour! La Pompadour!\" Every tongue repeated the name, the  goblets were drained to the bottoms, and a thunder of applause and  clattering of glasses followed the toast of the mistress of Louis XV.,  who was the special protectress of the Grand Company,--a goodly share of  whose profits in the monopoly of trade in New France was thrown into the  lap of the powerful favorite.    \"Come, Varin! your turn now!\" cried Bigot, turning to the Commissary;  \"a toast for Ville Marie! Merry Montreal! where they eat like rats of  Poitou, and drink till they ring the fire-bells, as the Bordelais did to  welcome the collectors of the gabelle. The Montrealers have not rung the  fire-bells yet against you, Varin, but they will by and by!\"    Varin filled his cup with an unsteady hand until it ran over, and  propping his body against the table as he stood up, replied, \"A  toast for Ville Marie! and our friends in need!--The blue caps of the  Richelieu!\" This was in allusion to a recent ordinance of the Intendant,  authorizing him to seize all the corn in store at Montreal and in the  surrounding country--under pretence of supplying the army, and really to  secure the monopoly of it for the Grand Company.    The toast was drunk, amid rapturous applause. \"Well said, Varin!\"  exclaimed Bigot; \"that toast implied both business and pleasure: the  business was to sweep out the granges of the farmers; the pleasure is to  drink in honor of your success.\"    \"My foragers sweep clean!\" said Varin, resuming his seat, and looking  under his hand to steady his gaze. \"Better brooms were never made in  Besancon. The country is swept as clean as a ball-room. Your Excellency  and the Marquise might lead the dance over it, and not a straw lie in  your way!\"    \"And did you manage it without a fight, Varin?\" asked the Sieur  d'Estebe, with a half sneer.    \"Fight! Why fight? The habitans will never resist the King's name. We  conjure the devil down with that. When we skin our eels we don't  begin at the tail! If we did, the habitans would be like the eels of  Melun--cry out before they were hurt. No! no! D'Estebe! We are more  polite in Ville Marie. We tell them the King's troops need the corn.  They doff their caps, and with tears in their eyes, say, 'Monsieur le  Commissaire, the King can have all we possess, and ourselves too, if he  will only save Canada from the Bostonnais.' This is better than stealing  the honey and killing the bees that made it, D'Estebe!\"    \"But what became of the families of the habitans after this swoop of  your foragers?\" asked the Seigneur de Beauce, a country gentleman  who retained a few honorable ideas floating on top of the wine he had  swallowed.    \"Oh! the families--that is, the women and children, for we took the men  for the army. You see, De Beauce,\" replied Varin, with a mocking air,  as he crossed his thumbs like a peasant of Languedoc when he wishes to  inspire belief in his words, \"the families have to do what the gentlemen  of Beauce practise in times of scarcity--breakfast by gaping! or they  can eat wind, like the people of Poitou: it will make them spit clean!\"    De Beauce was irritated at the mocking sign and the proverbial allusion  to the gaping of the people of Beauce. He started up in wrath, and  striking his fist on the table, \"Monsieur Varin!\" cried he, \"do not  cross your thumbs at me, or I will cut them off! Let me tell you the  gentlemen of Beauce do not breakfast on gaping, but have plenty of corn  to stuff even a Commissary of Montreal!\"    The Sieur Le Mercier, at a sign from Bigot, interposed to stop the  rising quarrel. \"Don't mind Varin,\" said he, whispering to De Beauce;  \"he is drunk, and a row will anger the Intendant. Wait, and by and by  you shall toast Varin as the chief baker of Pharoah, who got hanged  because he stole the King's corn.\"    \"As he deserves to be, for his insult to the gentlemen of Beauce,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27365"],[0,"Tales of Space and Time (#13)"],[1," odd things. The bright thing, too, they seemed to  have--like that glare that comes in the sky in daytime--only it jumps  about--it's really worth seeing. It's a thing with a root, too--like  grass when it is windy.\"    \"Does it bite?\" asked the she-bear. \"If it bites it can't be a plant.\"    \"No----I don't know,\" said Andoo. \"But it's curious, anyhow.\"    \"I wonder if they _are_ good eating?\" said the she-bear.    \"They look it,\" said Andoo, with appetite--for the cave bear, like the  polar bear, was an incurable carnivore--no roots or honey for _him_.    The two bears fell into a meditation for a space. Then Andoo resumed his  simple attentions to his eye. The sunlight up the green slope before the  cave mouth grew warmer in tone and warmer, until it was a ruddy amber.    \"Curious sort of thing--day,\" said the cave bear. \"Lot too much of it, I  think. Quite unsuitable for hunting. Dazzles me always. I can't smell  nearly so well by day.\"    The she-bear did not answer, but there came a measured crunching sound  out of the darkness. She had turned up a bone. Andoo yawned. \"Well,\" he  said. He strolled to the cave mouth and stood with his head projecting,  surveying the amphitheatre. He found he had to turn his head completely  round to see objects on his right-hand side. No doubt that eye would be  all right to-morrow.    He yawned again. There was a tap overhead, and a big mass of chalk flew  out from the cliff face, dropped a yard in front of his nose, and  starred into a dozen unequal fragments. It startled him extremely.    When he had recovered a little from his shock, he went and sniffed  curiously at the representative pieces of the fallen projectile. They  had a distinctive flavour, oddly reminiscent of the two drab animals of  the ledge. He sat up and pawed the larger lump, and walked round it  several times, trying to find a man about it somewhere....    When night had come he went off down the river gorge to see if he could  cut off either of the ledge's occupants. The ledge was empty, there were  no signs of the red thing, but as he was rather hungry he did not loiter  long that night, but pushed on to pick up a red deer fawn. He forgot  about the drab animals. He found a fawn, but the doe was close by and  made an ugly fight for her young. Andoo had to leave the fawn, but as  her blood was up she stuck to the attack, and at last he got in a blow  of his paw on her nose, and so got hold of her. More meat but less  delicacy, and the she-bear, following, had her share. The next  afternoon, curiously enough, the very fellow of the first white rock  fell, and smashed precisely according to precedent.    The aim of the third, that fell the night after, however, was better. It  hit Andoo's unspeculative skull with a crack that echoed up the cliff,  and the white fragments went dancing to all the points of the compass.  The she-bear coming after him and sniffing curiously at him, found him  lying in an odd sort of attitude, with his head wet and all out of  shape. She was a young she-bear, and inexperienced, and having sniffed  about him for some time and licked him a little, and so forth, she  decided to leave him until the odd mood had passed, and went on her  hunting alone.    She looked up the fawn of the red doe they had killed two nights ago,  and found it. But it was lonely hunting without Andoo, and she returned  caveward before dawn. The sky was grey and overcast, the trees up the  gorge were black and unfamiliar, and into her ursine mind came a dim  sense of strange and dreary happenings. She lifted up her voice and  called Andoo by name. The sides of the gorge re-echoed her.    As she approached the caves she saw in the half light, and heard a  couple of jackals scuttle off, and immediately after a hyaena howled and  a dozen clumsy bulks went lumbering up the slope, and stopped and yelled  derision. \"Lord of the rocks and caves--ya-ha!\" came down the wind. The  dismal feeling in the she-bear's mind became suddenly acute. She  shuffled across the amphitheatre.    \"Ya-ha!\" said the hyaenas, retreating. \"Ya-ha!\"    The cave bear was not lying quite in the same attitude, because the  hyaenas had been busy, and in one place his ribs showed white. Dotted  over the turf about him lay the smashed fragments of the three great  lumps of chalk. And the air was full of the scent of death.    The she-bear stopped dead. Even now, that the great and wonderful Andoo  was killed was beyond her believing. Then she heard far overhead a  sound, a queer sound, a little like the shout of a hyaena but fuller and  lower in pitch. She looked up, her little dawn-blinded eyes seeing  little, her nostrils quivering. And there, on the cliff edge, far above  her against the bright pink of dawn, were two little shaggy round dark  things, the heads of Eudena and Ugh-lomi, as they shouted derision at  her. But though she could not see them very distinctly she could hear,  and dimly she began to apprehend. A novel feeling as of imminent strange  evils came into her heart.    She began to examine the smashed fragments of chalk that lay about  Andoo. For a space she stood still, looking about her and making a low  continuous sound that was almost a moan. Then she went back  incredulously to Andoo to make one last effort to rouse him.      III--THE FIRST HORSEMAN    In the days before Ugh-lomi there was little trouble between the horses  and men. They lived apart--the men in the river swamps and thickets, the  horses on the wide grassy uplands between the chestnuts and the pines.  Sometimes a pony would come straying into the clogging marshes to make a  flint-hacked meal, and sometimes the tribe would find one, the kill of a  lion, and drive off the jackals, and feast heartily while the sun was  high. These horses of the old time were clumsy at the fetlock and  dun-coloured, with a rough tail and big head. They came every  spring-time north-westward into the country, after the swallows and  before the hippopotami, as the grass on the wide downland stretches  grew long. They came only in small bodies thus far, each herd, a  stallion and two or three mares and a foal or so, having its own stretch  of country, and they went again when the chestnut-trees were yellow and  the wolves came down the Wealden mountains.    It was their custom to graze right out in the open, going into cover  only in the heat of the day. They avoided the long stretches of thorn  and beechwood, preferring an isolated group of trees void of ambuscade,  so that it was hard to come upon them. They were never fighters; their  heels and teeth were for one another, but in the clear country, once  they were started, no living thing came near them, though perhaps the  elephant might have done so had he felt the need. And in those days man  seemed a harmless thing enough. No whisper of prophetic intelligence  told the species of the terrible slavery that was to come, of the whip  and spur and bearing-rein, the clumsy load and the slippery street, the  insufficient food, and the knacker's yard, that was to replace the wide  grass-land and the freedom of the earth.    Down in the Wey marshes Ugh-lomi and Eudena had never seen the horses  closely, but now they saw them every day as the two of them raided out  from their lair on the ledge in the gorge, raiding together in search of  food. They had returned to the ledge after the killing of Andoo; for of  the she-bear they were not afraid. The she-bear had become afraid of  them, and when she winded them she went aside. The two went together  everywhere; for since they had left the tribe Eudena was not so much  Ugh-lomi's woman as his mate; she learnt to hunt even--as much, that is,  as any woman could. She was indeed a marvellous woman. He would lie for  hours watching a beast, or planning catches in that shock head of his,  and she would stay beside him, with her bright eyes upon him, offering  no irritating suggestions--as still as any man. A wonderful woman!    At the top of the cliff was an open grassy lawn and then beechwoods, and  going through the beechwoods one came to the edge of the rolling grassy  expanse, and in sight of the horses. Here, on the edge of the wood and  bracken, were the rabbit-burrows, and here among the fronds Eudena and  Ugh-lomi would lie with their throwing-stones ready, until the little  people came out to nibble and play in the sunset. And while Eudena would  sit, a silent figure of watchfulness, regarding the burrows, Ugh-lomi's  eyes were ever away across the greensward at those wonderful grazing  strangers.    In a dim way he appreciated their grace and their supple nimbleness. As  the sun declined in the evening-time, and the heat of the day passed,  they would become active, would start chasing one another, neighing,  dodging, shaking their manes, coming round in great curves, sometimes so  close that the pounding of the turf sounded like hurried thunder. It  looked so fine that Ugh-lomi wanted to join in badly. And sometimes one  would roll over on the turf, kicking four hoofs heavenward, which seemed  formidable and was certainly much less alluring.    Dim imaginings ran through Ugh-lomi's mind as he watched--by virtue of  which two rabbits lived the longer. And sleeping, his brains were  clearer and bolder--for that was the way in those days. He came near the  horses, he dreamt, and fought, smiting-stone against hoof, but then the  horses changed to men, or, at least, to men with horses' heads, and he  awoke in a cold sweat of terror.    Yet the next day in the morning, as the horses were grazing, one of the  mares whinnied, and they saw Ugh-lomi coming up the wind. They all  stopped their eating and watched him. Ugh-lomi was not coming towards  them, but strolling obliquely across the open, looking at anything in  the world but horses. He had stuck three fern-fronds into the mat of his  hair, giving him a remarkable appearance, and he walked very slowly.  \"What's up now?\" said "]]]
