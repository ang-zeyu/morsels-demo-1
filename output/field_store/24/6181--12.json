There is a black almond-eyed person belonging to the Royal  Scots, who begins to twist as far as I can see her, and comes up in long  curves, extremely genially. A small shaggy chap who belongs to the Royal  Irish stands upon his hind legs and spars with his front feet--and lots  of others--every one of them \"a soldier and a man\". The Royal Scots have  a monkey, Jenny, who goes around always trailing a sack in her hand,  into which she creeps if necessary to obtain shelter.    The other day old Jack, my horse, was bitten by his next neighbor; he  turned SLOWLY, eyed his opponent, shifted his rope so that he had a  little more room, turned very deliberately, and planted both heels in  the offender's stomach. He will not be run upon.      From a time still further back comes a note in a like strain. In 1898 he  was house physician in a children's hospital at Mt. Airy, Maryland, when  he wrote:      A kitten has taken up with a poor cripple dying of muscular atrophy who  cannot move. It stays with him all the time, and sleeps most of the  day in his straw hat. To-night I saw the kitten curled up under the  bed-clothes. It seems as if it were a gift of Providence that the little  creature should attach itself to the child who needs it most.      Of another child:      The day she died she called for me all day, deposed the nurse who was  sitting by her, and asked me to remain with her. She had to be held up  on account of lack of breath; and I had a tiring hour of it before she  died, but it seemed to make her happier and was no great sacrifice. Her  friends arrived twenty minutes too late. It seems hard that Death will  not wait the poor fraction of an hour, but so it is.      And here are some letters to his nephews and nieces which reveal his  attitude both to children and to animals.        From Bonfire to Sergt.-Major Jack Kilgour    August 6th, 1916.    Did you ever have a sore hock? I have one now, and Cruickshank puts  bandages on my leg. He also washed my white socks for me. I am glad you  got my picture. My master is well, and the girls tell me I am looking  well, too. The ones I like best give me biscuits and sugar, and  sometimes flowers. One of them did not want to give me some mignonette  the other day because she said it would make me sick. It did not make me  sick. Another one sends me bags of carrots. If you don't know how to eat  carrots, tops and all, you had better learn, but I suppose you are just  a boy, and do not know how good oats are.                                            BONFIRE His * Mark.           * Here and later, this mark is that of a horse-shoe.  A. L., 1995.        From Bonfire to Sergt.-Major Jack Kilgour    October 1st, 1916.    Dear Jack,    Did you ever eat blackberries? My master and I pick them every day on  the hedges. I like twenty at a time. My leg is better but I have a lump  on my tummy. I went to see my doctor to-day, and he says it is nothing  at all. I have another horse staying in my stable now; he is black, and  about half my size. He does not keep me awake at night. Yours truly,                                            BONFIRE His * Mark.        From Bonfire to Margaret Kilgour, Civilian    November 5th, 1916.    Dear Margaret:    This is Guy Fox Day! I spell it that way because fox-hunting was my  occupation a long time ago before the war. How are Sergt.-Major Jack and  Corporal David? Ask Jack if he ever bites through his rope at night, and  gets into the oat-box. And as for the Corporal, \"I bet you\" I can jump  as far as he can. I hear David has lost his red coat. I still have my  grey one, but it is pretty dirty now, for I have not had a new one for  a long time. I got my hair cut a few weeks ago and am to have new boots  next week. Bonneau and Follette send their love. Yours truly,                                            BONFIRE His * Mark.        In Flanders, April 3rd, 1915.    My dear Margaret:    There is a little girl in this house whose name is Clothilde. She is ten  years old, and calls me \"Monsieur le Major\". How would you like it if  twenty or thirty soldiers came along and lived in your house and put  their horses in the shed or the stable? There are not many little boys  and girls left in this part of the country, but occasionally one meets  them on the roads with baskets of eggs or loaves of bread. Most of them  have no homes, for their houses have been burnt by the Germans; but they  do not cry over it. It is dangerous for them, for a shell might hit them  at any time--and it would not be an eggshell, either.    Bonfire is very well. Mother sent him some packets of sugar, and if ever  you saw a big horse excited about a little parcel, it was Bonfire. He  can have only two lumps in any one day, for there is not much of it.  Twice he has had gingerbread and he is very fond of that. It is rather  funny for a soldier-horse, is it not? But soldier horses have a pretty  hard time of it, sometimes, so we do not grudge them a little luxury.  Bonfire's friends are King, and Prince, and Saxonia,--all nice big boys.  If they go away and leave him, he whinnies till he catches sight of  them again, and then he is quite happy. How is the 15th Street Brigade  getting on? Tell Mother I recommend Jack for promotion to corporal if  he has been good. David will have to be a gunner for awhile yet, for  everybody cannot be promoted. Give my love to Katharine, and Jack, and  David.    Your affectionate uncle Jack.        Bonfire, and Bonneau, and little Mike, are all well. Mike is about four  months old and has lost an eye and had a leg broken, but he is a very  good little boy all the same. He is very fond of Bonfire, and Bonneau,  and me. I go to the stable and whistle, and Bonneau and Mike come  running out squealing with joy, to go for a little walk with me. When  Mike comes to steps, he puts his feet on the lowest steps and turns and  looks at me and I lift him up. He is a dear ugly little chap.    The dogs are often to be seen sprawled on the floor of my tent. I like  to have them there for they are very home-like beasts. They never seem  French to me. Bonneau can \"donner la patte\" in good style nowadays, and  he sometimes curls up inside the rabbit hutch, and the rabbits seem to  like him.    I wish you could see the hundreds of rabbits there are here on the  sand-dunes; there are also many larks and jackdaws. (These are different  from your brother Jack, although they have black faces.) There are  herons, curlews, and even ducks; and the other day I saw four young  weasels in a heap, jumping over each other from side to side as they  ran.    Sir Bertrand Dawson has a lovely little spaniel, Sue, quite black, who  goes around with him. I am quite a favourite, and one day Sir Bertrand  said to me, \"She has brought you a present,\" and here she was waiting  earnestly for me to remove from her mouth a small stone. It is usually a  simple gift, I notice, and does not embarrass by its value.    Bonfire is very sleek and trim, and we journey much. If I sit down in  his reach I wish you could see how deftly he can pick off my cap and  swing it high out of my reach. He also carries my crop; his games are  simple, but he does not readily tire of them.    I lost poor old Windy. He was the regimental dog of the 1st Batt.  Lincolns, and came to this vale of Avalon to be healed of his second  wound. He spent a year at Gallipoli and was \"over the top\" twice with  his battalion. He came to us with his papers like any other patient, and  did very well for a while, but took suddenly worse. He had all that care  and love could suggest and enough morphine to keep the pain down; but he  was very pathetic, and I had resolved that it would be true friendship  to help him over when he \"went west\". He is buried in our woods like  any other good soldier, and yesterday I noticed that some one has laid  a little wreath of ivy on his grave. He was an old dog evidently, but  we are all sore-hearted at losing him. His kit is kept should his master  return,--only his collar with his honourable marks, for his wardrobe was  of necessity simple. So another sad chapter ends.        September 29th, 1915.    Bonneau gravely accompanies me round the wards and waits for me, sitting  up in a most dignified way. He comes into my tent and sits there very  gravely while I dress. Two days ago a Sister brought out some biscuits  for Bonfire, and not understanding the rules of the game, which are bit  and bit about for Bonfire and Bonneau, gave all to Bonfire, so that  poor Bonneau sat below and caught the crumbs that fell. I can see that  Bonfire makes a great hit with the Sisters because he licks their hands  just like a dog, and no crumb is too small to be gone after.        April, 1917.    I was glad to get back; Bonfire and Bonneau greeted me very  enthusiastically. I had a long long story from the dog, delivered with  uplifted muzzle. They tell me he sat gravely on the roads a great deal  during my absence, and all his accustomed haunts missed him. He is back  on rounds faithfully.          VII. The Old Land and the New      If one were engaged upon a formal work of biography rather than a mere  essay in character, it would be just and proper to investigate the  family sources from which the individual member is sprung; but I must  content myself within the bounds which I have set, and leave the larger  task to a more laborious hand. The essence of history lies in the  character of the persons concerned, rather than in the feats which  they performed. A man neither lives to himself nor in himself. He is  indissolubly bound up with his stock, and can only explain himself in  terms common to his family; but in doing so he transcends the limits of  history, and passes into the realms of philosophy and religion.    The life of a Canadian is bound up with the history of his parish, of  his town, of his province,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35304"],[0,"The Last Stroke: A Detective Story (#13)"],[1,"of the neighbours.\"    There seemed little need of this caution, for they saw no one as they  crossed to the quiet street in which Mrs. Fry lived. But Ferrars, who  had fallen behind the others, had an observant eye upon all within  range, as if, as the doctor afterward declared, he held the very town  itself under suspicion.    Mrs. Fry awaited them at the side door, and unlocked the one leading to  the front hall and stairway at once.    \"I hope one of you has got a pistol,\" she said, nervously, as they  approached the stairs.    \"There's no one up there, Mrs. Fry,\" replied Ferrars. \"Never fear.\" But  Mrs. Fry was not so positive. She closed the sitting-room door, all but  the merest crack, and stood ready to clap it entirely shut at the first  sound of attack and defence from the room above.    Meantime Robert Brierly, who had led the way upstairs, placed a firm  hand upon the key, turned it and softly opened the door. Then, for a  moment, all three stood still at the threshold, gazing within.    It was Francis Ferrars who spoke the first word, with his hand upon  Robert Brierly's shoulder, and his voice little more than a whisper.    \"Go inside, Brierly, quickly and quietly.\" He gave the shoulder under  his hand a quick, light, forward pressure, and instinctively, as it  seemed, Brierly stepped across the threshold with the other two close at  his heels, and, the moment they were inside the room, Ferrars turned and  silently withdrew the key from the outer side, closed the door  cautiously, and relocked it from within.    \"We will do well to dispense with Mrs. Fry, at least for the present,\"  he said, coolly. \"It's plain enough there has been mischief here. Mr.  Brierly, you saw this room last night, for a moment.\"    Robert Brierly, who had dropped weakly upon a chair, stopped him with a  movement of the hand.    \"Mr. Ferrars,\" he said, \"I realise the importance of a right beginning  here, and if you will undertake this case--I am not a rich man, you  understand--all I have is at your disposal. I could hardly bear to have  my brother's rooms searched by strange hands in my absence, but will it  not be wise that you should take the lead, and begin as you deem best?\"    \"Yes,\" replied the detective, \"but your assistance will be helpful.\"    \"Mrs. Fry is coming upstairs,\" broke in the doctor, who had been  standing near the door.    Ferrars sprang across the room, turned the key, and put his head out  through the smallest possible opening in the door.    \"There's no one here, Mrs. Fry; and nothing missing, that we have  observed. It was, no doubt, a boyish trick.\"    He smiled amiably at the somewhat surprised woman.    \"When Mr. Brierly has had time to look about a bit he will of course  report to you.\" And he closed the door in the good woman's astonished  face. \"Better make no confidants until we know what we have to confide,\"  he said, turning back to survey the room afresh. \"Now let us have more  light here.\"    The room in which they were was dimly lighted, for the outer blinds of  its three windows had been closed, and all the light afforded them came  from the one nearest the front corner, where half the shutter was  swinging loosely at the will of the morning breeze. This light, however,  enabled them to see that the room was in some confusion, or rather,  that it was not in the same neat order in which they had seen it on the  previous day.    The writing desk, which later Mrs. Fry declared to have been closed, was  now open, and a portion of the contents of its usually neatly arranged  pigeon-holes was scattered upon the leaf.    \"This,\" said Brierly, as they approached it, \"was closed when I saw it  last night.\"    \"I remember,\" Ferrars nodded, and sat down in the revolving chair before  the desk, and, without touching anything, ran his eye carefully over the  scattered papers, examined the pigeon-holes, the locks, and even the  fine coating of dust.    Upon a round table near the front window were some scattered books,  mostly of reference, a pile of unruled manuscript tablets, and a little  heap of written sheets. There was a set of bookshelves above the  writing-desk, and a wire rack near it was filled with newspapers and  magazines.    When Ferrars had carefully noted the appearance of the desk and its  contents, he swung slowly around in the swivel chair and gazed all about  him without rising. He had noted the books above him with a thoughtful  gaze, and he now fixed that same speculative glance upon those upon the  table. Then he got up.    \"Oblige me by not so much as touching this desk yet,\" he said, and  crossed to the table. \"Your brother was a magazinist, Mr. Brierly?\" he  queried.    \"Yes,\" replied Brierly.    Ferrars turned toward the inner room which the others had not yet  approached.    \"Ah!\" he exclaimed suddenly, and then, in an altered tone, \"Here is Mrs.  Fry's missing lamp.\"    His two companions came to the door of the room, where Ferrars was now  looking down at the pillows of the bed.    \"Brierly,\" asked Ferrars, as they paused in the doorway, \"what had your  brother with him in the way of valuables, to your knowledge?\"    The young man, who had been looking sharply about the room like one who  seeks something which should be there, started slightly.    \"Why, he had a somewhat odd and valuable watch, which was given him by  our father upon our setting out for Europe. It was like this,\" and he  produced a very beautiful specimen of the watchmaker's art, and held it  out for inspection. \"He also had a ring set with a fine opal, that was  once our mother's, and a locket with her monogram. There were also some  odd trifles that he had picked up abroad, saying that they would become  his future wife, no doubt.\"    \"And you think these were still in his possession?\"    \"I do. In writing of Miss Grant not long ago he mentioned as a proof of  her refinement and womanly delicacy that she would accept no gifts from  him other than books or flowers.\"    \"I think,\" said Ferrars, gravely, \"that we had better have Mrs. Fry in  here now, and I want you to do the talking, Brierly. Doctor, if you  would ask her to come up, I'll post Mr. Brierly, meantime.\"    The doctor turned the key in the lock and then hesitated. \"I dare say I  will not be needed here longer?\"    \"You!\" Ferrars turned upon him quickly. \"Is there anything urgent  outside?\"    \"Not especially so--only----\"    \"Only you fancy yourself _de trop_? If you can spare us the time, we  want you right here, doctor. Eh, Mr. Brierly?\"    \"By all means.\"    \"Then of course I am at your disposal,\" and the doctor went out in  search of Mrs. Fry.    \"I wish there were more men with his combined delicacy and good sense,\"  grumbled Ferrars, and then he began to explain to Brierly what was  wanted from Mrs. Fry.    When that good woman entered, Ferrars was seated by the furthest  window, and Robert Brierly met her at the door.    \"Mrs. Fry,\" he began, \"will you kindly look about you, without, of  course, disturbing or changing things, and tell us if you see anything  that has changed? If you miss anything, or if anything in your opinion,  has been tampered with? Look through both rooms carefully, and then give  us your opinion.\"    Mrs. Fry, who had been expecting just such a summons and who fully  realised the gravity of the occasion, stood still in her place near the  door and looked slowly about her; then she began to walk about the room.  Once or twice Brierly, prompted by a glance from the detective, had to  warn her against putting a finger upon some object, but she went about  with firmly closed lips until she had reached the little sleeping room.  Then--    \"Well, I declare!\" she broke out. \"If they haven't even been at the  bed!\"    Brierly started forward, but Ferrars held up a warning finger.    \"And there's that lamp!\" she went on, \"with the chimney all smoked!  Somebody's been carrying it around burning full tilt.\"    By this time Ferrars was so close beside Brierly that he could breathe a  low word in his ear, from time to time, unnoted by the woman as she went  peering about.    \"You are sure the bed has been disturbed?\" Brierly asked.    \"Certain of it!\"    \"And can you guess why?\"    \"Well, he always kept his pistol under the bolster.\"    The men started and looked at each other. \"What an oversight,\" murmured  the doctor.    \"Do you mean,\" went on the enquiry, \"that it was there yesterday morning  when you made the bed?\"    \"I can't say, sir. The fact is, I was awfully afraid of the thing, and  when I told him I was, he put it clear under the bolster with his own  hand, and said it should stay there, instead of on top, as it used to be  at first.\"    \"You don't mean that he left it there during the day?\"    \"Yes, sir! This one. You see he had two. The one he used to practise  with--the one they found--was different. This one was bigger and  different somehow, and not like any pistol I ever saw. He told me 'twas  a foreign weapon.\"    \"She is right,\" said Brierly. \"My brother brought a pair of duelling  pistols from Paris. They were elaborately finished. He gave me one of  them.\" He looked anxiously toward the crushed and displaced pillows.  \"Shall we not look,\" he asked, \"and find out if anything is there? Will  you look, Mr. Ferrars? Or did you?\"    Ferrars moved forward. \"No, I did not look,\" he said. \"But the weapon is  not there; I could almost swear to it. Come--see, all of you.\"    With a quick light hand he removed the pillows, turned back the sheets  and lifted the bolster. There was nothing beneath it, save the  impression where the weapon had laid upon the mattress.    The detective turned toward Mrs. Fry. \"You are sure it was here  usually?\" he questioned.    \"I have lifted that bolster carefully every day, and have always seen  it,\" she declared. \"When I wanted to turn the mattress he always took  away the pistol himself.\"    Ferrars turned away from the bed, and Brierly resumed his role of  questioner.
