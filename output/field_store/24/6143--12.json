For  I had not known or learned that neither was evil a substance, nor our  soul that chief and unchangeable good.    For as deeds of violence arise, if that emotion of the soul be  corrupted, whence vehement action springs, stirring itself insolently  and unrulily; and lusts, when that affection of the soul is ungoverned,  whereby carnal pleasures are drunk in, so do errors and false opinions  defile the conversation, if the reasonable soul itself be corrupted; as  it was then in me, who knew not that it must be enlightened by another  light, that it may be partaker of truth, seeing itself is not that  nature of truth. For Thou shalt light my candle, O Lord my God, Thou  shalt enlighten my darkness: and of Thy fulness have we all received,  for Thou art the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the  world; for in Thee there is no variableness, neither shadow of change.    But I pressed towards Thee, and was thrust from Thee, that I might taste  of death: for thou resistest the proud. But what prouder, than for me  with a strange madness to maintain myself to be that by nature which  Thou art? For whereas I was subject to change (so much being manifest  to me, my very desire to become wise, being the wish, of worse to become  better), yet chose I rather to imagine Thee subject to change, and  myself not to be that which Thou art. Therefore I was repelled by Thee,  and Thou resistedst my vain stiffneckedness, and I imagined corporeal  forms, and, myself flesh, I accused flesh; and, a wind that passeth  away, I returned not to Thee, but I passed on and on to things which  have no being, neither in Thee, nor in me, nor in the body. Neither were  they created for me by Thy truth, but by my vanity devised out of  things corporeal. And I was wont to ask Thy faithful little ones, my  fellow-citizens (from whom, unknown to myself, I stood exiled), I was  wont, prating and foolishly, to ask them, \"Why then doth the soul err  which God created?\" But I would not be asked, \"Why then doth God  err?\" And I maintained that Thy unchangeable substance did err upon  constraint, rather than confess that my changeable substance had gone  astray voluntarily, and now, in punishment, lay in error.    I was then some six or seven and twenty years old when I wrote those  volumes; revolving within me corporeal fictions, buzzing in the ears  of my heart, which I turned, O sweet truth, to thy inward melody,  meditating on the \"fair and fit,\" and longing to stand and hearken to  Thee, and to rejoice greatly at the Bridegroom's voice, but could not;  for by the voices of mine own errors, I was hurried abroad, and through  the weight of my own pride, I was sinking into the lowest pit. For Thou  didst not make me to hear joy and gladness, nor did the bones exult  which were not yet humbled.    And what did it profit me, that scarce twenty years old, a book of  Aristotle, which they call the ten Predicaments, falling into my hands  (on whose very name I hung, as on something great and divine, so often  as my rhetoric master of Carthage, and others, accounted learned,  mouthed it with cheeks bursting with pride), I read and understood it  unaided? And on my conferring with others, who said that they scarcely  understood it with very able tutors, not only orally explaining it, but  drawing many things in sand, they could tell me no more of it than I had  learned, reading it by myself. And the book appeared to me to speak very  clearly of substances, such as \"man,\" and of their qualities, as the  figure of a man, of what sort it is; and stature, how many feet high;  and his relationship, whose brother he is; or where placed; or when  born; or whether he stands or sits; or be shod or armed; or does, or  suffers anything; and all the innumerable things which might be ranged  under these nine Predicaments, of which I have given some specimens, or  under that chief Predicament of Substance.    What did all this further me, seeing it even hindered me? when,  imagining whatever was, was comprehended under those ten Predicaments,  I essayed in such wise to understand, O my God, Thy wonderful and  unchangeable Unity also, as if Thou also hadst been subjected to Thine  own greatness or beauty; so that (as in bodies) they should exist in  Thee, as their subject: whereas Thou Thyself art Thy greatness and  beauty; but a body is not great or fair in that it is a body, seeing  that, though it were less great or fair, it should notwithstanding be  a body. But it was falsehood which of Thee I conceived, not truth,  fictions of my misery, not the realities of Thy blessedness. For Thou  hadst commanded, and it was done in me, that the earth should bring  forth briars and thorns to me, and that in the sweat of my brows I  should eat my bread.    And what did it profit me, that all the books I could procure of the  so-called liberal arts, I, the vile slave of vile affections, read by  myself, and understood? And I delighted in them, but knew not whence  came all, that therein was true or certain. For I had my back to the  light, and my face to the things enlightened; whence my face, with which  I discerned the things enlightened, itself was not enlightened.  Whatever was written, either on rhetoric, or logic, geometry, music,  and arithmetic, by myself without much difficulty or any instructor,  I understood, Thou knowest, O Lord my God; because both quickness of  understanding, and acuteness in discerning, is Thy gift: yet did I not  thence sacrifice to Thee. So then it served not to my use, but rather  to my perdition, since I went about to get so good a portion of my  substance into my own keeping; and I kept not my strength for Thee, but  wandered from Thee into a far country, to spend it upon harlotries. For  what profited me good abilities, not employed to good uses? For I felt  not that those arts were attained with great difficulty, even by the  studious and talented, until I attempted to explain them to such; when  he most excelled in them who followed me not altogether slowly.    But what did this further me, imagining that Thou, O Lord God, the  Truth, wert a vast and bright body, and I a fragment of that body?  Perverseness too great! But such was I. Nor do I blush, O my God, to  confess to Thee Thy mercies towards me, and to call upon Thee, who  blushed not then to profess to men my blasphemies, and to bark against  Thee. What profited me then my nimble wit in those sciences and all  those most knotty volumes, unravelled by me, without aid from human  instruction; seeing I erred so foully, and with such sacrilegious  shamefulness, in the doctrine of piety? Or what hindrance was a far  slower wit to Thy little ones, since they departed not far from Thee,  that in the nest of Thy Church they might securely be fledged, and  nourish the wings of charity, by the food of a sound faith. O Lord our  God, under the shadow of Thy wings let us hope; protect us, and carry  us. Thou wilt carry us both when little, and even to hoar hairs wilt  Thou carry us; for our firmness, when it is Thou, then is it firmness;  but when our own, it is infirmity. Our good ever lives with Thee;  from which when we turn away, we are turned aside. Let us now, O Lord,  return, that we may not be overturned, because with Thee our good lives  without any decay, which good art Thou; nor need we fear, lest there  be no place whither to return, because we fell from it: for through our  absence, our mansion fell not--Thy eternity.          BOOK V      Accept the sacrifice of my confessions from the ministry of my tongue,  which Thou hast formed and stirred up to confess unto Thy name. Heal  Thou all my bones, and let them say, O Lord, who is like unto Thee? For  he who confesses to Thee doth not teach Thee what takes place within  him; seeing a closed heart closes not out Thy eye, nor can man's  hard-heartedness thrust back Thy hand: for Thou dissolvest it at Thy  will in pity or in vengeance, and nothing can hide itself from Thy heat.  But let my soul praise Thee, that it may love Thee; and let it confess  Thy own mercies to Thee, that it may praise Thee. Thy whole creation  ceaseth not, nor is silent in Thy praises; neither the spirit of man  with voice directed unto Thee, nor creation animate or inanimate, by the  voice of those who meditate thereon: that so our souls may from their  weariness arise towards Thee, leaning on those things which Thou hast  created, and passing on to Thyself, who madest them wonderfully; and  there is refreshment and true strength.    Let the restless, the godless, depart and flee from Thee; yet Thou seest  them, and dividest the darkness. And behold, the universe with them is  fair, though they are foul. And how have they injured Thee? or how have  they disgraced Thy government, which, from the heaven to this lowest  earth, is just and perfect? For whither fled they, when they fled from  Thy presence? or where dost not Thou find them? But they fled, that they  might not see Thee seeing them, and, blinded, might stumble against Thee  (because Thou forsakest nothing Thou hast made); that the unjust, I say,  might stumble upon Thee, and justly be hurt; withdrawing themselves from  thy gentleness, and stumbling at Thy uprightness, and falling upon their  own ruggedness. Ignorant, in truth, that Thou art every where, Whom no  place encompasseth! and Thou alone art near, even to those that remove  far from Thee. Let them then be turned, and seek Thee; because not as  they have forsaken their Creator, hast Thou forsaken Thy creation. Let  them be turned and seek Thee; and behold, Thou art there in their heart,  in the heart of those that confess to Thee, and cast themselves upon  Thee, and weep in Thy bosom, after all their rugged ways. Then dost  Thou gently wipe away their tears, and they weep the more, and joy  in"]]]
