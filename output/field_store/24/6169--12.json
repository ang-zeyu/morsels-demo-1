Here, as the others rode up, he sat  cross-legged in his saddle, and waited.    \"We'll hang up awhile,\" he said. \"Reckon you're tired?\"    \"I'm hungry, but not tired yet,\" replied Bo.    Helen dismounted, to find that walking was something she had apparently  lost the power to do. Bo laughed at her, but she, too, was awkward when  once more upon the ground.    Then Roy got down. Helen was surprised to find him lame. He caught her  quick glance.    \"A hoss threw me once an' rolled on me. Only broke my collar-bone, five  ribs, one arm, an' my bow-legs in two places!\"    Notwithstanding this evidence that he was a cripple, as he stood there  tall and lithe in his homespun, ragged garments, he looked singularly  powerful and capable.    \"Reckon walkin' around would be good for you girls,\" advised Dale. \"If  you ain't stiff yet, you'll be soon. An' walkin' will help. Don't go  far. I'll call when breakfast's ready.\"      A little while later the girls were whistled in from their walk and  found camp-fire and meal awaiting them. Roy was sitting cross-legged,  like an Indian, in front of a tarpaulin, upon which was spread a homely  but substantial fare. Helen's quick eye detected a cleanliness and  thoroughness she had scarcely expected to find in the camp cooking of  men of the wilds. Moreover, the fare was good. She ate heartily, and  as for Bo's appetite, she was inclined to be as much ashamed of that as  amused at it. The young men were all eyes, assiduous in their service  to the girls, but speaking seldom. It was not lost upon Helen how  Dale's gray gaze went often down across the open country. She divined  apprehension from it rather than saw much expression in it.    \"I--declare,\" burst out Bo, when she could not eat any more, \"this  isn't believable. I'm dreaming.... Nell, the black horse you rode is the  prettiest I ever saw.\"    Ranger, with the other animals, was grazing along the little brook.  Packs and saddles had been removed. The men ate leisurely. There  was little evidence of hurried flight. Yet Helen could not cast off  uneasiness. Roy might have been deep, and careless, with a motive to  spare the girls' anxiety, but Dale seemed incapable of anything he did  not absolutely mean.    \"Rest or walk,\" he advised the girls. \"We've got forty miles to ride  before dark.\"    Helen preferred to rest, but Bo walked about, petting the horses and  prying into the packs. She was curious and eager.    Dale and Roy talked in low tones while they cleaned up the utensils and  packed them away in a heavy canvas bag.    \"You really expect Anson 'll strike my trail this mornin'?\" Dale was  asking.    \"I shore do,\" replied Roy.    \"An' how do you figure that so soon?\"    \"How'd you figure it--if you was Snake Anson?\" queried Roy, in reply.    \"Depends on that rider from Magdalena,\" Said Dale, soberly. \"Although  it's likely I'd seen them wheel tracks an' hoss tracks made where we  turned off. But supposin' he does.\"    \"Milt, listen. I told you Snake met us boys face to face day before  yesterday in Show Down. An' he was plumb curious.\"    \"But he missed seein' or hearin' about me,\" replied Dale.    \"Mebbe he did an' mebbe he didn't. Anyway, what's the difference whether  he finds out this mornin' or this evenin'?\"    \"Then you ain't expectin' a fight if Anson holds up the stage?\"    \"Wal, he'd have to shoot first, which ain't likely. John an' Hal, since  thet shootin'-scrape a year ago, have been sort of gun-shy. Joe might  get riled. But I reckon the best we can be shore of is a delay. An' it'd  be sense not to count on thet.\"    \"Then you hang up here an' keep watch for Anson's gang--say long enough  so's to be sure they'd be in sight if they find our tracks this mornin'.  Makin' sure one way or another, you ride 'cross-country to Big Spring,  where I'll camp to-night.\"    Roy nodded approval of that suggestion. Then without more words both men  picked up ropes and went after the horses. Helen was watching Dale, so  that when Bo cried out in great excitement Helen turned to see a savage  yellow little mustang standing straight up on his hind legs and pawing  the air. Roy had roped him and was now dragging him into camp.    \"Nell, look at that for a wild pony!\" exclaimed Bo.    Helen busied herself getting well out of the way of the infuriated  mustang. Roy dragged him to a cedar near by.    \"Come now, Buckskin,\" said Roy, soothingly, and he slowly approached the  quivering animal. He went closer, hand over hand, on the lasso. Buckskin  showed the whites of his eyes and also his white teeth. But he stood  while Roy loosened the loop and, slipping it down over his head,  fastened it in a complicated knot round his nose.    \"Thet's a hackamore,\" he said, indicating the knot. \"He's never had a  bridle, an' never will have one, I reckon.\"    \"You don't ride him?\" queried Helen.    \"Sometimes I do,\" replied Roy, with a smile. \"Would you girls like to  try him?\"    \"Excuse me,\" answered Helen.    \"Gee!\" ejaculated Bo. \"He looks like a devil. But I'd tackle him--if you  think I could.\"    The wild leaven of the West had found quick root in Bo Rayner.    \"Wal, I'm sorry, but I reckon I'll not let you--for a spell,\" replied  Roy, dryly.    \"He pitches somethin' powerful bad.\"    \"Pitches. You mean bucks?\"    \"I reckon.\"    In the next half-hour Helen saw more and learned more about how horses  of the open range were handled than she had ever heard of. Excepting  Ranger, and Roy's bay, and the white pony Bo rode, the rest of the  horses had actually to be roped and hauled into camp to be saddled and  packed. It was a job for fearless, strong men, and one that called for  patience as well as arms of iron. So that for Helen Rayner the thing  succeeding the confidence she had placed in these men was respect. To an  observing woman that half-hour told much.    When all was in readiness for a start Dale mounted, and said,  significantly: \"Roy, I'll look for you about sundown. I hope no sooner.\"    \"Wal, it'd be bad if I had to rustle along soon with bad news. Let's  hope for the best. We've been shore lucky so far. Now you take to the  pine-mats in the woods an' hide your trail.\"    Dale turned away. Then the girls bade Roy good-by, and followed. Soon  Roy and his buckskin-colored mustang were lost to sight round a clump of  trees.    The unhampered horses led the way; the pack-animals trotted after them;  the riders were close behind. All traveled at a jog-trot. And this gait  made the packs bob up and down and from side to side. The sun felt  warm at Helen's back and the wind lost its frosty coldness, that almost  appeared damp, for a dry, sweet fragrance. Dale drove up the shallow  valley that showed timber on the levels above and a black border of  timber some few miles ahead. It did not take long to reach the edge of  the forest.    Helen wondered why the big pines grew so far on that plain and no  farther. Probably the growth had to do with snow, but, as the ground  was level, she could not see why the edge of the woods should come just  there.    They rode into the forest.    To Helen it seemed a strange, critical entrance into another world,  which she was destined to know and to love. The pines were big,  brown-barked, seamed, and knotted, with no typical conformation except  a majesty and beauty. They grew far apart. Few small pines and little  underbrush flourished beneath them. The floor of this forest appeared  remarkable in that it consisted of patches of high silvery grass and  wide brown areas of pine-needles. These manifestly were what Roy  had meant by pine-mats. Here and there a fallen monarch lay riven or  rotting. Helen was presently struck with the silence of the forest and  the strange fact that the horses seldom made any sound at all, and when  they did it was a cracking of dead twig or thud of hoof on log. Likewise  she became aware of a springy nature of the ground. And then she saw  that the pine-mats gave like rubber cushions under the hoofs of the  horses, and after they had passed sprang back to place again, leaving no  track. Helen could not see a sign of a trail they left behind. Indeed,  it would take a sharp eye to follow Dale through that forest. This  knowledge was infinitely comforting to Helen, and for the first time  since the flight had begun she felt a lessening of the weight upon mind  and heart. It left her free for some of the appreciation she might have  had in this wonderful ride under happier circumstances.    Bo, however, seemed too young, too wild, too intense to mind what the  circumstances were. She responded to reality. Helen began to suspect  that the girl would welcome any adventure, and Helen knew surely now  that Bo was a true Auchincloss. For three long days Helen had felt a  constraint with which heretofore she had been unfamiliar; for the last  hours it had been submerged under dread. But it must be, she concluded,  blood like her sister's, pounding at her veins to be set free to race  and to burn.    Bo loved action. She had an eye for beauty, but she was not  contemplative. She was now helping Dale drive the horses and hold them  in rather close formation. She rode well, and as yet showed no symptoms  of fatigue or pain. Helen began to be aware of both, but not enough yet  to limit her interest.    A wonderful forest without birds did not seem real to her. Of all living  creatures in nature Helen liked birds best, and she knew many and could  imitate the songs of a few. But here under the stately pines there were  no birds. Squirrels, however, began to be seen here and there, and in  the course of an hour's travel became abundant. The only one with which  she was familiar was the chipmunk. All the others, from the slim bright  blacks to the striped russets and the white-tailed grays, were totally  new to her. They appeared tame and curious.

These words are so old that we can only guess their history.    Those of you who like pretty things have often fingered admiringly  some bright, shining necklace of amber beads. The pieces of amber  from which those beads were cut were picked up on the shores of the  Baltic Sea, and it is supposed that once upon a time some great pines  or firs dropped their gummy juice and this hardened into these  beautiful transparent stones.    Pines and firs are some of our greatest tree givers. They seem never  tired of giving. Can you think of anything that is made of pine or fir  wood? Perhaps you remember hearing that the seats or panels or  ceilings in your school or church were of the wood of an American pine  called the pitch pine. But common fir wood has a name of its own. Who  has not heard of _deal_? A _deal_ is a part or portion, and so we talk  of a great deal of something meaning a large portion. Our fir wood  comes in great quantities from Norway and Germany, where it is first  cut and sawn into planks. Each plank is a _deal_--that is, a portion  of the wood. It has been easy to leave out the article and call the  wood _deal_.    Our white deal comes from the firs, chiefly from the Norway spruce.  The darker-coloured deal is the gift of the Scotch pine.    How can the great trees be carried from the mountain-tops, do you  suppose? The streams are the carriers; they float the great trunks  down to the rivers, where they are tied together in great rafts and  floated on again to their new home, or to the seaport from which they  can be shipped to foreign lands. Sometimes when the nearest stream is  at a long distance from the trees, a wooden slide is made to it. In  the winter, water is poured down the slide, and when it freezes the  trees easily shoot down the slippery way to the stream. Oh, what fun  it must be! You would like to be there to see. In the year 1810, when  all Europe was at war with the great Emperor Napoleon, the deal  traffic on the Baltic Sea was stopped. What was to be done? Near the  Lake of Lucerne there is a high mountain, called Mont Pilate, covered  with great forests of pine and fir. If these could only be cut down  and brought to the lake, they could easily be floated down the Rhine  to the sea. So a tremendous slide was made from Mont Pilate to the  lake. It was six feet broad, and from three to six feet deep, and  eight miles long, and twenty-five thousand pine trees were used in  making it. When water had been poured down and had frozen, the great  trunks were started one at a time. Away they shot, and reached the  lake, eight miles off, in six minutes, and in wet weather, when the  slide was very slippery, they were only three minutes on the way.    Look at the deal planks on the floor of your room. Do you see those  dark knots? They show you where once branches sprang out of the trunk.  Many of these decayed and dropped off while quite young, and a little  store of juice prepared for the branch gathered into the knot and  turned it brown and dark. You will often find the knots in pairs,  showing you how the branches grew opposite one another.    These long straight lines in the plank that we call the _grain_ show  the rings of wood made by the pine tree year by year.    How astonished you would be if suddenly out of that plank a great  insect were to creep and spread out its wings. This sometimes  happens, to the alarm of the people in the room, but only when the  wood is new and has been used too soon, before it was properly dried  and seasoned. The insect looks very formidable, for it has a long,  pointed weapon at the end of its body, but it is quite harmless. It is  called the _giant sirex_, and it looks something like a wasp or  hornet. With its weapon it pierces holes in the pine tree bark and  lays its eggs there. The grubs eat great tunnels in the trunk, and  when they are full grown they creep nearly to the outside, and there  wait till they are changed and their wings are ready before they creep  out. Sometimes while they wait the tree is cut down and then they are  either sawn in two or left inside the plank.    We often see young fir trees in a very strange place, bearing  wonderful fruit of gold and silver shining lights, and glittering  toys.                  \"The fir tree stood                  In a beautiful room;                A hundred tapers                  Dispelled the gloom.        All decked with gold and silver was he,      And lilies and roses so fair to see.      Hurrah for the fir tree, the Christmas tree;      A prince in all the forests is he!                  The little children                  With merry shout                Came crowding, clustering                  Round about.        Brighter and rounder grew their eyes,      And they gazed at the fir in glad surprise.      Hurrah for the fir tree, the Christmas tree;      A prince in all the forests is he!\"          WHO LOVES THE TREES BEST?          Who loves trees best?      \"I,\" said the spring,      \"Their leaves so beautiful      To them I bring.\"        Who loves the trees best?      \"I,\" summer said,      \"I give them blossoms,      White, yellow, red.\"        Who loves the trees best?      \"I,\" said the fall,      \"I give luscious fruits,      Bright tints to all!\"        Who loves the trees best?      \"I love them best,\"      Harsh winter answered,      \"I give them rest.\"          CHRISTMAS EVERYWHERE          A CHRISTMAS SONG          Everywhere, everywhere, Christmas to-night!

Phillips Brooks.          THE SHEPHERD MAIDEN'S GIFT    (Eastern Legend)      In the quiet midnight, peace brooded over the fields where the  shepherds were watching their flocks. The tinkling of sheepbells, the  bleating of lambs, and the barking of watchdogs had gradually ceased.  Around a large campfire several shepherds lay resting, for they had  had a long, hard day. Each had beside him a strong shepherd's crook  and a stout club ready for use in case any lurking danger threatened  the beloved flocks.    Not far away from the campfire a shepherd maiden lay sleeping in the  rude shelter of a rocky cave. All day long she had helped her father  guard the sheep, and when darkness fell over the fields and hills, she  was glad to lie down in her snug bed made of the fleecy skins of kids  and lambs.    Suddenly a light filled the cave and wakened the maiden. Thinking it  was daybreak, she sprang up, stepped to the rude doorway, and pushed  aside the curtain of goatskin.    \"What has happened?\" she whispered.    The fields and hills were flooded with light. The group of shepherds  were standing close together, gazing intently at the luminous eastern  sky. A moment later she saw them fall on their knees in worship. There  in the entrance of her rude shelter, she, too, knelt and prayed.  Clearly she saw the shining angel appear and in the peaceful stillness  of the night she heard these words:    \"Be not afraid; for, behold, I bring good tidings of great joy which  shall be to all the people: for there is born to you this day, in the  city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be  the sign unto you: ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes  and lying in a manger.\"    And suddenly there was with the angel many, many others. Together they  lifted up their voices in praise and sang,        \"Glory to God in the highest,      Peace on earth      Good will toward men.\"    When the sweet music died away, the maiden rose to her feet and joined  the shepherds.    \"I saw the angel, Father, and heard the singing,\" she whispered.    \"Christ, the Lord, is born,\" answered her father.    \"Let us hasten to Bethlehem and see the Heavenly Child who fulfills  the promise of God,\" said one of the shepherds.    \"Shall we leave our flocks?\" asked another. But the question was not  answered.    \"Come, let us see what gifts we have to carry to the Christ-child,\"  said the shepherd who first saw the light in the sky.    In a few moments these simple-hearted men were ready to start across  the fields and over the low hills to Bethlehem. Very humble gifts they  had to offer, but their hearts were filled with joy and wonder.    Standing near the entrance to the cave the shepherd maiden could see  the outline of the group of men making their way to the city of David.  \"They are going to see the Christ-child,\" she said to herself, \"a babe  wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.\"    How she would love to see the Heavenly Child! A deep longing to behold  the little new-born King seized her. She would follow the shepherds to  Bethlehem. One glimpse at the Christ-child would fill her heart with  joy.    Away over the star-lit fields and hills she started. Not once did she  falter, although the way was long and some of the hillsides were hard  to climb.    Finally, she saw the shepherds pass in the gate of the city of  Bethlehem.    \"I came to see the Christ-child,\" she said to a group of people who  stood whispering together. They looked at her in astonishment.    \"I am following the shepherds,\" she added.    \"They have gone to the inn,\" was the answer.    When she reached the inn she was directed to a cave near, which served  as a stable.    There through the entrance she saw the shepherds lay their humble  presents at Mary's feet and then kneel in solemn adoration.    \"I have brought nothing to offer,\" whispered the maiden, looking  wistfully into the rude shelter."]]]
