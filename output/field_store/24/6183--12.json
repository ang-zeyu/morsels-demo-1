During this time, it was observed, that one of the Indians, instead of  mixing with the rest, stood aloof, in a musing posture, contemplating what  passed. When we offered to approach him, he shunned us not, and willingly  shook hands with all who chose to do so. He seemed to be between 30 and 40  years old, was jolly, and had a thoughtful countenance, much marked by the  smallpox. He wore a string of bits of dried reed round his neck, which I  asked him to exchange for a black stock. He smiled at the proposal, but  made no offer of what I wanted; which our young friend, Imeerawanyee,  observing, flew to him, and taking off the necklace, directly fixed it  about my neck. I feared he would be enraged, but he bore it with serenity,  and suffered a gentleman present to fasten his black stock upon him, with  which he appeared to be pleased. To increase his satisfaction, some other  trifle was given to him.    Having remained here an hour we went in quest of Baneelon, agreeably to the  directions which his companions pointed out. We found him and Barangaroo  shivering over a few lighted sticks, by which they were dressing small  fish, and their canoe hauled up on the beach near them. On first seeing the  boat, they ran into the woods; but on being called by name, they came back,  and consented to our landing. We carried on shore with us the remaining  part of the fish-gigs and spears which had been stolen, and restored them  to Baneelon. Among other things, was a net full of fishing lines and  other tackle, which Barangaroo said was her property and, immediately on  receiving it, she slung it around her neck.    Baneelon inquired, with solicitude, about the state of the governor's  wound, but he made no offer of restoring the dirk; and when he was asked  for it, he pretended to know nothing of it, changing the conversation with  great art, and asking for wine, which was given to him.    At parting, we pressed him to appoint a day on which he should come to  Sydney, assuring him, that he would be well received, and kindly treated.  Doubtful, however, of being permitted to return, he evaded our request, and  declared that the governor must first come and see him, which we promised  should be done.    The governor did not hesitate to execute the engagement which we had  contracted for him. But Baneelon still resisted coming among us, and  matters continued in this fluctuating state until the 8th of October, when  a fire, which they had agreed to light as a signal for us to visit them,  was observed. The eager desire by which we were stimulated to carry our  point of effecting an intercourse had appeared. Various parties accordingly  set out to meet them, provided with different articles, which we thought  would prove acceptable to them. We found assembled, Baneelon, Barangaroo,  and another young woman, and six men, all of whom received us with welcome,  except the grave looking gentleman before mentioned, who stood aloof in  his former musing posture. When they saw that we had brought hatchets, and  other articles with us, they produced spears, fish-gigs, and lines, for  the purpose of barter,* which immediately commenced, to the satisfaction  of both parties. I had brought with me an old blunted spear, which wanted  repair. An Indian immediately undertook to perform the task, and carrying  it to a fire, tore with his teeth a piece of bone from a fish-gig, which he  fastened on the spear with yellow gum, rendered flexible by heat.    [*It had long been our wish to establish a commerce of this sort. It is a  painful consideration, that every previous addition to the cabinet of the  virtuosi, from this country, had wrung a tear from the plundered Indian.]      October, 1790. Many of them now consented to be shaved by a barber whom we  had purposely brought over. As I thought he who could perform an operation  of such importance must be deemed by them an eminent personage, I bade him  ask one of them for a fine barbed spear which he held in his hand; but all  the barber's eloquence was wasted on the Indian, who plainly gave him to  understand that he meant not to part with his spear, without receiving an  equivalent. Unfortunately, his price was a hatchet, and the only one which  I had brought with me was already disposed of to the man who had pointed  my spear. In vain did I tempt him with a knife, a handkerchief, and a hat;  nothing but a hatchet seemed to be regarded. 'Bulla mogo parrabugo' (two  hatchets to-morrow) I repeatedly cried; but having probably experienced our  insincerity, he rejected the proposal with disdain. Finding him inflexible,  and longing to possess the spear, I told him at length that I would go  to Sydney and fetch what he required. This seemed to satisfy, and he  accompanied me to my boat, in which I went away, and as quickly as possible  procured what was necessary to conclude the bargain. On my return, I was  surprised to see all our boats rowing towards home, and with them a  canoe, in which sat two Indians paddling. I pulled to them, and found that  Baneelon, and another Indian, were in one of the boats, and that the whole  formed a party going over to visit the governor. I now learned, that during  my absence, the governor had passed in a boat, on his return from Rose  Hill, near the place where they were standing; and that finding he would  not come to them, although they had called to him to do so, they had at  once determined to venture themselves unreservedly among us. One of the men  in the canoe was the person to whom I was to give the hatchet I had been  to fetch; and directly as he saw me, he held up his spear, and the exchange  took place, with which, and perhaps to reward me for the trouble I had  taken, he was so delighted that he presented me with a throwing-stick  'gratis'.    Not seeing Barangaroo of the party, I asked for her, and was informed that  she had violently opposed Baneelon's departure. When she found persuasion  vain, she had recourse to tears, scolding, and threats, stamping the  ground, and tearing her hair. But Baneelon continuing determined, she  snatched up in her rage one of his fish-gigs, and dashed it with such fury  on the rocks, that it broke. To quiet her apprehensions on the score of her  husband's safety, Mr. Johnson, attended by Abaroo, agreed to remain as a  hostage until Baneelon should return.    We landed our four friends opposite the hospital, and set out for the  governor's house. On hearing of their arrival, such numbers flocked to view  them that we were apprehensive the crowd of persons would alarm them,  but they had left their fears behind, and marched on with boldness and  unconcern. When we reached the governor's house, Baneelon expressed  honest joy to see his old friend, and appeared pleased to find that he had  recovered of his wound. The governor asked for Wileemarin, and they said  he was at Broken Bay. Some bread and beef were distributed among them but  unluckily no fish was to be procured, which we were sorry for, as a promise  of it had been one of the leading temptations by which they had been  allured over. A hatchet apiece was, however, given to them, and a couple  of petticoats and some fishing tackle sent for Barangaroo, and the other  woman.    The ceremony of introduction being finished, Baneelon seemed to consider  himself quite at home, running from room to room with his companions, and  introducing them to his old friends, the domestics, in the most familiar  manner. Among these last, he particularly distinguished the governor's  orderly sergeant, whom he kissed with great affection, and a woman who  attended in the kitchen; but the gamekeeper, M'Entire*, he continued to  hold in abhorrence, and would not suffer his approach.    [*Look at the account of the governor being wounded, when his detestation  of this man burst forth.]    Nor was his importance to his countrymen less conspicuous in other  respects. He undertook to explain the use and nature of those things which  were new to them. Some of his explanations were whimsical enough. Seeing,  for instance, a pair of snuffers, he told them that they were \"Nuffer* for  candle,\"--which the others not comprehending, he opened the snuffers, and  holding up the fore-finger of his left hand, to represent a candle, made  the motion of snuffing it. Finding, that even this sagacious interpretation  failed, he threw down the snuffers in a rage, and reproaching their  stupidity, walked away.    [*The S is a letter which they cannot pronounce, having no sound in their  language similar to it. When bidden to pronounce sun, they always say tun;  salt, talt, and so of all words wherein it occurs.]    It was observed, that a soft gentle tone of voice, which we had taught him  to use, was forgotten, and his native vociferation returned in full force.  But the tenderness which (like Arabanoo) he had always manifested to  children, he still retained; as appeared by his behaviour to those who were  presented to him.    The first wish they expressed to return, was complied with, in order to  banish all appearance of constraint, the party who had conducted them to  Sydney returning with them. When we reached the opposite shore, we  found Abaroo and the other woman fishing in a canoe, and Mr. Johnson  and Barangaroo sitting at the fire, the latter employed in manufacturing  fish-hooks. At a little distance, on an adjoining eminence, sat an Indian,  with his spear in his hand, as if sentinel over the hostages, for the  security of his countrymen's return. During our absence, Barangaroo  had never ceased whining, and reproaching her husband. Now that he was  returned, she met him with unconcern, and seemed intent on her work only,  but this state of repose did not long continue. Baneelon, eyeing the broken  fish-gig, cast at her a look of savage fury and began to interrogate "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35345"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 5, No. 4, April, 1852 (#13)"],[1,"ficient,  and was the article then turned out of hand complete for that other  state? The Inquisition biographer does not dwell upon this, it was  perhaps as well.

BITTER WORDS.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE,    BY R. H. STODDARD.

Even now, without endeavor,        Thou hast wounded so my pride,      I could leave thee, and for ever--        Though I died!          THE MURDER OF LATOUR.    WRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE,    BY HON. W. H. STILES.[2]      The cabinet remained in deliberation at the Ministry of War, situated at  the corner of the square called the Hof. The tide of insurrection now  rose to an unconquerable height. The nearest shots of the retiring  cannons, the advancing shouts of the infuriated people, warned the  ministers that all defence was rapidly becoming hopeless. The building  itself still offered some means of resistance, and there were two  cannons in the court; but at that crisis was issued a written order,  signed by Latour and Wessenberg, \"to cease the fire at all points,\" and  given to officers for distribution.[3] It was in vain. The popular  torrent rolled on toward the seat of government, which was destined ere  long to be disgraced by atrocious crime. The minister of war, Count  Latour, prepared for defence. The military on guard in front of the war  office were withdrawn into the yards, with two pieces of artillery  loaded with grape. The gates were closed, the military distributed to  the different threatened points, and the cannons directed towards the  two gates; soon the scene of battle had reached the Bogner Gasse,  immediately under the windows of the war department; the ministers in  consultation heard the cry, \"The military retreat.\" The great square of  the Hof was soon cleared, the soldiers retiring by the way of the  Freyung. The guards and academic legion pursuing; the military  commander's quarters in the Freyung are soon captured. The retiring  military not being able to escape through the Schotten-Thor, as they had  expected, that gate being closed and barricaded, they cut their way  through the Herrn Gasse.    So intent were the respective combatants, either in retreat or pursuit,  that the whole tempest of war swept over the Hof, and left that square,  for a short time, deserted and silent.    But that stillness was but of short duration; a few moments only had  elapsed, when a number of straggling guards, students, and people, came  stealing silently from the Graben, through the Bogner, Naglus, and  Glosken Gasse, on to the Hof, and removed the dead and the wounded into  the neighboring dwellings, and into the deserted guard-house in the war  department. These were soon followed by a fierce and noisy mob, armed  with axes, pikes, and iron bars, which halted before the war office, and  began to thunder at its massive doors.    The officer of ordnance in vain attempted to communicate to the crowd  the order of the ministry, that all firing should cease. A member of the  academic legion, from the window, over the gateway, waved with a white  handkerchief to the tumultuous masses, and, exhibiting the order signed  by Latour and Wessenberg, read its contents to the crowd.    But a pacification was not to be thought of; the people were too  excited, their fury could only be appeased by blood; that delayed  measure was not sufficient; they made negative gesticulations, and  summoned the student to come down and open the portals to their  admission. The tumult increased from minute to minute; the closed doors  at length gave way under the axes of the mob, and the people streamed  in, led by a man \"in a light gray coat.\"    The secretary of war, having by this time abandoned the idea of defence,  on the ground either that it was useless or impolitic, no shots were  fired or active resistance offered; but the orderlies with their horses  retired to the stables, and the grenadiers into an inner court. At first  only single individuals entered, and their course was not characterized  by violence; then groups, proceeding slowly, listening, and searching;  and, at last the tumultuous masses thundered in the rear.    Ere long the cry rung on the broad staircase, \"Where is Latour? he must  die!\" At this moment the ministers and their followers in the building,  with the exception of Latour himself, found means to escape, or mingled  with the throng. The deputies, Smolka, Borrosch, Goldmark, and  Sierakowski, who had undertaken to guarantee protection to the  threatened ministers, arrived in the hope of restraining the mob. The  numerous corridors and cabinets of the war office (formerly a monastery  of the Jesuits) were filled with the crowd; the tide of insurrection now  rose to an uncontrollable height; and the danger of Latour became every  moment more imminent.    The generals who were with him, perceiving the peril, entreated him to  throw himself upon the Nassau regiment or the Dutch Meister grenadiers,  and retreat to their barracks. He scorned the proposal, denied the  danger, and even refused, for some time, to change his uniform for a  civilian's dress, until the hazard becoming more evident, he put on  plain clothes, and went up into a small room in the roof of the  building, where he soon after signed a paper declaring that, with his  majesty's consent, he was ready to resign the office of minister of war.  A Tecnicker, named Ranch,[4] who, it was said, had come to relieve the  secretary of war, was seized and hung in the court by his own scarf, but  fortunately cut down by a National Guard before life was extinct. The  mob rushed into the private apartment of the minister, but plundered it  merely of the papers, which were conveyed to the university. They came  with a sterner purpose. The act of resignation, exhibited to the crowd  by the deputy Smolka, was scornfully received by the people, while the  freshness of the writing, the sand adhering still to the ink, betrayed  the proximity of the hand which had just traced it. Meanwhile, the crowd  had penetrated the corridors of the fourth story, and were not long in  discovering the place of Latour's concealment. Hearing their approach,  and recognizing the voice of Smolka, vice-president of the assembly, who  was doubtless anxious to protect him, Latour came out of his retreat.    They descended together from the fourth story by a narrow stairway, on  the right-hand side of the building, and entered the yard by the pump.  At each successive landing place, the tumult and the crowd increased;  but the descent was slow, and rendered more and more difficult by the  numbers which joined the crowd at every turn of the stairs. At length  they reached the court below, and Count Latour, although he had been  severely pressed, was still unhurt; but here the populace, which awaited  them, broke in upon the group that still clustered around Latour, and  dispersed it. In vain did the deputies, Smolka and Sierakowski, endeavor  to protect the minister; in vain did the Count Leopold Gondrecourt  attempt to cover him by the exposure of his own body. A workman struck  the hat from his head; others pulled him by his gray locks, he defending  himself with his hands, which were already bleeding. At length a  ruffian, disguised as a Magyar, gave him, from behind, a mortal blow  with a hammer, the man in the gray coat cleft his face with a sabre, and  another plunged a bayonet into his heart. A hundred wounds followed,  and, with the words, \"I die innocent!\" he gave up his loyal and manly  spirit. A cry of exultation from the assembled crowd rent the air at  this event. Every indignity was offered to his body; before he had  ceased to breathe even, they hung him by a cord to the grating of a  window in the court of the war office. He had been suspended there but a  few minutes when, from the outrages committed on it, the body fell.    They then dragged it to the Hof, and suspended it to one of the bronze  candelabras that adorn that extensive, and much frequented square, and  there treated it with every indignity; it remained for fourteen hours  exposed to the gaze of a mocking populace.    FOOTNOTES:    [2] A chapter from Mr. Stiles's forthcoming work on Austria, which we  have mentioned elsewhere in this number of the International.    [3] The last order issued by the unfortunate Latour was instructed to  Colonel Gustave Schindler, of the imperial engineers, an efficient  officer, as well as a most amiable and accomplished gentleman, and one  well and favourably known in the United States, from his kind attention  to Americans who have visited the Austrian capital. The colonel was in  the act of passing out of the great door of the war office, which opens  on the Hof, when the mob reached that spot. Recognized by his imperial  uniform, he was instantly surrounded and attacked. He received many  blows on the head, inflicted by the crowd with clubs and iron bars; was  most severely wounded, and would probably have been killed but for the  timely interference of one of the rabble, who, riding up on horseback  between the colonel and the mob, shielded him from further blow, and  finally effected his escape.
