[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#13)"],[1,"I was, by an anatomical peculiarity similar to that which the larvae  of the Cetoniae and Anoxiae had shown me in their nerve-centres. Having  observed in the Silk-worm a nervous system formed of ganglia distinct  one from the other, he was quite surprised to find that, in the grub  of the Oryctes, the same system was concentrated into a short chain of  ganglia in juxtaposition. His was the surprise of the anatomist who,  studying the organ qua organ, sees for the first time an unusual  conformation. Mine was of a different nature: I was amazed to see the  precision with which the paralysis of the victim sacrificed by the  Scolia, a paralysis so profound in spite of the difficulties of an  underground operation, had guided my forecast as to structure when,  anticipating the dissection, I declared in favour of an exceptional  concentration of the nervous system. Physiology perceived what anatomy  had not yet revealed, at all events to my eyes, for since then,  on dipping into my books, I have learnt that these anatomical  peculiarities, which were then so new to me, are now within the domain  of current science. We know that, in the Scarabaeidae, both the larva  and the perfect insect are endowed with a concentrated nervous system.    The Garden Scolia attacks Oryctes nasicornis; the Two-banded Scolia  the Cetonia; the Interrupted Scolia the Anoxia. All three operate below  ground, under the most unfavourable conditions; and all three have for  their victim a larva of one of the Scarabaeidae, which, thanks to the  exceptional arrangement of its nerve-centres, lends itself, alone of all  larvae, to the Wasp's successful enterprises. In the presence of  this underground game, so greatly varied in size and shape and yet  so judiciously selected to facilitate paralysis, I do not hesitate to  generalize and I accept, as the ration of the other Scoliae, larvae of  Lamellicorns whose species will be determined by future observation.  Perhaps one of them will be found to give chase to the terrible enemy of  my crops, the voracious White Worm, the grub of the Cockchafer; perhaps  the Hemorrhoidal Scolia, rivalling in size the Garden Scolia and like  her, no doubt, requiring a copious diet, will be entered in the insects'  \"Who's Who\" as the destroyer of the Pine-chafer, that magnificent  Beetle, flecked with white upon a black or brown ground, who of an  evening, during the summer solstice, browses on the foliage of the  fir-trees. Though unable to speak with certainty or precision, I am  inclined to look upon these devourers of Scarabaeus-grubs as valiant  agricultural auxiliaries.    The Cetonia-larva has figured hitherto only in its quality of a  paralysed victim. We will now consider it in its normal state. With its  convex back and its almost flat ventral surface, the creature is like a  semi-cylinder in shape, fuller in the hinder portion. On the back, each  of the segments, except the last, or anal, segment, puckers into three  thick pads, bristling with stiff, tawny hairs. The anal segment, much  wider than the rest, is rounded at the end and coloured a deep brown by  the contents of the intestine, which show through the translucent skin;  it bristles with hairs like the other segments, but is level, without  pads. On the ventral surface, the segments have no creases; and the  hairs, though abundant, are rather less so than on the back. The legs,  which are quite well-formed, are short and feeble in comparison with  the animal's size. The head has a strong, horny cap for a cranium. The  mandibles are powerful, with bevelled tips and three or four teeth on  the edge of the bevel.    Its mode of locomotion marks it as an idiosyncratic, exceptional,  fantastic creature, having no fellow, that I know of, in the insect  world. Though endowed with legs--a trifle short, it is true, but after  all as good as those of a host of other larvae--it never uses them for  walking. It progresses on its back, always on its back, never otherwise.  By means of wriggling movements and the purchase afforded by the dorsal  bristles, it makes its way belly upwards, with its legs kicking the  empty air. The spectator to whom these topsy-turvy gymnastics are a  novelty thinks at first that the creature must have had a fright of some  sort and that it is struggling as best it can in the face of danger.  He puts it back on its belly; he lays it on its side. Nothing is of any  use; it obstinately turns over and resumes its dorsal progress. That is  its manner of travelling over a flat surface; it has no other.    This reversal of the usual mode of walking is so peculiar to the  Cetonia-larva that it is enough in itself to reveal the grub's identity  to the least expert eyes. Dig into the vegetable mould formed by the  decayed wood in the hollow trunks of old willow-trees, search at the  foot of rotten stumps or in heaps of compost; and, if you come upon a  plumpish grub moving along on its back, there is no room for doubt: your  discovery is a Cetonia-larva.    This topsy-turvy progress is fairly swift and is not less in speed to  that of an equally fat grub travelling on its legs. It would even be  greater on a polished surface, where walking on foot is hampered by  incessant slips, whereas the numerous hairs of the dorsal pads find  the necessary support by multiplying the points of contact. On polished  wood, on a sheet of paper and even on a strip of glass, I see my grubs  moving from point to point with the same ease as on a surface of garden  mould. In the space of one minute, on the wood of my table, they cover a  distance of eight inches. The pace is no swifter on a horizontal bed of  sifted mould. A strip of glass reduces the distance covered by one  half. The slippery surface only half paralyses this strange method of  locomotion.    We will now place side by side with the Cetonia-grub the larva of the  Morning Anoxia, the prey of the Interrupted Scolia. It is very like the  larva of the Common Cockchafer. It is a fat, pot-bellied grub, with a  thick, red cap on its head and armed with strong, black mandibles, which  are powerful implements for digging and cutting through roots. The legs  are sturdy and end in a hooked nail. The creature has a long, heavy,  brown paunch. When placed on the table, it lies on its side; it  struggles without being able to advance or even to remain on its belly  or back. In its usual posture it is curled up into a narrow hook. I have  never seen it straighten itself completely; the bulky abdomen prevents  it. When placed on a surface of moist sand, the ventripotent creature is  no better able to shift its position: curved into a fish-hook, it lies  on its side.    To dig into the earth and bury itself, it uses the fore-edge of its  head, a sort of weeding-hoe with the two mandibles for points. The  legs take part in this work, but far less effectually. In this way it  contrives to dig itself a shallow pit. Then, bracing itself against the  wall of the pit, with the aid of wriggling movements which are favoured  by the short, stiff hairs bristling all over its body, the grub changes  its position and plunges into the sand, but still with difficulty.    Apart from a few details, which are of no importance here, we may repeat  this sketch of the Anoxia-grub and we shall have, if the size be at  least quadrupled, a picture of the larva of Oryctes nasicornis, the  monstrous prey of the Garden Scolia. Its general appearance is the same:  there is the same exaggeration of the belly; the same hook-like curve;  the same incapacity for standing on its legs. And as much may be said  of the larva of Scarabaeus pentodon, a fellow-boarder of the Oryctes and  the Cetonia.        CHAPTER 5. THE PROBLEM OF THE SCOLIAE.    Now that all the facts have been set forth, it is time to collate them.  We already know that the Beetle-hunters, the Cerceres (Cf. \"The Hunting  Wasps\": chapters 1 to 3.--Translator's Note.), prey exclusively on the  Weevils and the Buprestes, that is, on the families whose nervous system  presents a degree of concentration which may be compared with that of  the Scolia's victims. Those predatory insects, working in the open  air, are exempt from the difficulties which their emulators, working  underground, have to overcome. Their movements are free and are directed  by the sense of sight; but their surgery is confronted in another  respect with a most arduous problem.    The victim, a Beetle, is covered at all points with a suit of armour  which the sting is unable to penetrate. The joints alone will allow the  poisoned lancet to pass. Those of the legs do not in any way comply with  the conditions imposed: the result of stinging them would be merely a  partial disorder which far from subduing the insect, would render it  more dangerous by irritating it yet further. A sting in the joint of the  neck is not admissible: it would injure the cervical ganglia and lead  to death, followed by putrefaction. There remains only the joint between  the corselet and the abdomen.    The sting, in entering here, has to abolish all movement with a single  stab, for any movement would imperil the rearing of the larva. The  success of the paralysis, therefore, demands that the motor ganglia,  at least the three thoracic ganglia, shall be packed in close contact  opposite this point. This determines the selection of Weevils and  Buprestes, both of which are so strongly armoured.    But where the prey has only a soft skin, incapable of stopping the  sting, the concentrated nervous system is no longer necessary, for  the operator, versed in the anatomical secrets of her victim, knows to  perfection where the centres of innervation lie; and she wounds them  one after another, if need be from the first to the last. Thus do the  Ammophilae go to work when dealing with their caterpillars and the  Sphex-wasps when dealing with their Locusts, Ephippigers and Crickets.    With the Scoliae we come once again to a soft"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34645"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 3 (of 6) (#13)"],[1,"penetrative oils, came into use. Thus, after the imitation  of buildings, easily drawn from the number of their right lines, that of  figures began to be practised in an able manner, though it had formerly  been tried with less success. The chief merit of such improvement, or  rather perfection of the art, was due to the Venetian School. Lorenzo  Canozio, from Lendinara, a fellow student of Mantegna, who died about  1477, inlaid the entire choir of the church of S. Antonio, even, as it  would appear, with figures. The whole, however, having been consumed by  fire, there is nothing remaining but the epitaph of the artificer, in  which he is highly applauded for his labours. There likewise exist other  works of the same kind, in the armadj, chests, or presses, of the  sacristy, and, as it is supposed, also in some of the confessionals.  Besides Lorenzo, his brother Cristofano, and his son-in-law Pierantonio,  who assisted him in these labours, are equally applauded by Matteo  Siculo, as worthy of vieing with Phidias and Apelles themselves.  Tiraboschi likewise enumerates the two brothers among the artists of  Modena, whose fellow citizens they were.    But the fame of these soon expired. For Giovanni da Verona, a layman of  Oliveto, not long after, surpassed them in the same art. He practised it  in various cities of Italy, and at Rome itself, in the service of Pope  Julius II; but still more successfully in the sacristy of his own order,  where his works are still to be seen in the best condition. F. Vincenzo  delle Vacche, also a native of Verona, and a layman of Oliveto,  mentioned by the learned Morelli in his _Notizia_ of works of design,  during the first half of the sixteenth century, deserves mention here  for the merit of his inlaid works; and in particular for those wrought  in Padua, at the church of S. Benedetto Novello. Unacquainted, however,  with the period in which he flourished, I shall not venture to announce  him either as a pupil or assistant to Fra Giovanni. Similar productions,  from the hand of Fra Raffaello da Brescia, also of Oliveto, adorning the  choir of S. Michele in Bosco at Bologna, might here be mentioned in  competition with those in the sacristy of Verona, by natives of Oliveto.    Moreover, there remains Fra Damiano da Bergamo, a Dominican monk, who  ornamented his own church at Bergamo, and that of Bologna in a still  better style; in which the choir is inlaid with the greatest art. In S.  Pietro, at Perugia, he also wrought the most beautiful histories. The  same artist, as we find recorded in Vasari, succeeded also in refining  the art of colours and of shades, to such a degree as to be held the  very first in this line. He possessed either a rival, or a pupil, in  Gianfrancesco Capodiferro, whose mansions at S. Maria Maggiore, in  Bergamo, are the finest specimens of the kind, though occasionally  betraying some traces of stiffness in their manner. There too he worked  after the designs of Lotto, and instructed in the art his brother Pietro  and his son Zinino, so that the city continued to be supplied with  excellent artificers during a number of years. The largest and most  artificially wrought figures I have seen in this line are in a choir of  the Certosa at Pavia, distributed one by one upon each side. The  artificer is said to have been one Bartolommeo da Pola, whose name I  have not met with elsewhere. In each of the squares is represented a  bust of one of the Apostles, or some other saint, designed in the taste  of the Da Vinci School. A few of the pictures of these artists are to be  found in galleries of art; among which, those from the hand of F.  Damiano are the most esteemed. Finally, this species of workmanship,  embracing materials too much exposed to the moth and to the fire, by  degrees began to grow out of date: and if more lately it appears to have  again revived, it has failed hitherto in producing any works deserving  of commemoration.

The learned  Morelli also, in his Annotations to the _Notizia_, confirms, by fresh  arguments, the same epoch, p. 146.]    [Footnote 9: Page 101.]    [Footnote 10: This was given to the public by Muratori, with the  following title--_Riccobaldi Ferrariensis, sive anonimi scriptoris  compilatio chronologica usque ad annum 1312._ (Rerum Italicarum  Scriptores, vol. ix. p. 255.)]    [Footnote 11: Sig. Sasso observed one extremely like it in Venice, with  the subscription _Guglielmus pinxit_, 1368; from which he inferred that  he had belonged to the school of Guariento.]    [Footnote 12: This _Sebeto_ of Vasari appeared so new to Maffei, that he  would willingly have substituted Stefano; (_see Ver. Illust._ p. iii.  col. 152,) but Stefano da Verona, or da Zevio, is a name posterior to  these times. The _Notizia_ of the anonymous writer, recently published,  says, that the church of the before mentioned S. George was ornamented  by \"Jacopo Davanzo, a Paduan, or a Veronese, if not, as some will have  it, a Bolognese; by Altichiero Veronese, according to Campagnuola, p.  6.\" It must be observed that Vasari also consulted the latter, or  probably one of his Latin letters to Niccolo Leonico Tomeo, quoting it  several times. (See Morelli, p. 101.) Now in this it was probably  written, _ab Alticherio de Jebeto_; that is, da Zevio, which was at one  time called _Jebetum_, and Vasari believed it to be the name of an  unknown painter. Such is the conjecture communicated to me by Sig.  Brandolese, and it appears extremely probable.]    [Footnote 13: Signor Abbate Morelli, since P. della Valle, has  discovered another painting existing in the Sacristy of the Padri  Conventuali, at Vicenza, with this inscription, 1333, PAULUS DE VENETIIS  PINXIT HOC OPUS, (_Notiz._ p. 222). He adds also, two other Venetian  painters, with whom I have enriched this new edition; the name of one  found in a small picture of the Conventuali, at S. Arcangelo, under an  image of the Virgin, among various saints, dated 1385. _Jachobelus de  Bonomo Venetus pinxit hoc opus._ The other, in the territory of  Verruchio, on a crucifixion, with the symbols of the four Evangelists,  is in the possession of the Agostiniani, and inscribed 1404: _Nicholaus  Paradixi miles de Venetiis pinxit_.]    [Footnote 14: Among these is counted Stefano Pievano, of St. Agnese, an  able artist, who left his name along with the date, 1381, on an  altarpiece of the _Assumption_:--a piece in which the Venetian colouring  is displayed to advantage, while the expression, lively and full of  meaning, compensates for its inaccuracy of design. Another artist  deserving of being known is Jacopo di _Alberegno_, whose family still  remains in Venice, and who has been ascertained to be the author of a  painting without date, representing the Crucifixion of our Saviour,  among various saints. Tommaso da Modena has also been referred to the  Venetian School, who, about the period of 1351, produced two Holy  Virgins at Venice; a St. Catherine, at present in the gallery of N. H.  Ascanio Molin, together with the two preceding, and other rare Venetian  pictures of the same epoch; and a S. Barbara, belonging to the Abbate  Mauro Boni, so fraught with expression, grace, and power of colouring,  as to lead me to conjecture he had flourished at a much later period,  were it not for the inscribed date. His beginning to be known at Venice  is some reason why he should be referred to this school, if the name of  his native place, _de Mutina_, did not restrain us from so doing without  some further doubt. The Ab. Boni, who has given us an account of these  pictures in an article put forth by the Italian academy, was the first  to discover them.]    [Footnote 15: Before their time, however, Bergamo could boast a school  of painting, as witness what Count Tassi adduces in a parchment of the  year 1296, naming a certain Guglielmo, _pittore_. It does not appear in  what style he drew. One of his successors, who painted the tree of St.  Bonaventura, abounding in sacred figures, shews himself an artist more  rude, indeed, but more original than either of the brothers de Nova. Of  his name we are, however, ignorant, as he only attached the date of  1347.]    [Footnote 16: In the work intitled _Narrazione dell'Isola di Murano_, by  _G. A. Moschini_, the supposition I have above stated has been combated  by its excellent author. A picture in the gallery of the N. H. Molin, at  Venice, subscribed _Johannes Vivarinus_, seems to have persuaded him of  my mistake. In a work embracing an account of some thousand painters, I  cannot pretend to boast of its being free from some human errors, and  was about to express my gratitude to the above mentioned author for  having pointed one of them out. But I am now convinced that the picture  is from the hand of another artist, and that the signature in question  is a forgery, the author of which has confounded the character of what  is called Gothic and Roman, in place of imitating the true character of  those times, which he might very easily have done, inasmuch as he had  before his eyes a small chart, with a most devout oration, _Deus meus  charitas_, &c. in the most complete Gothic, or rather German character  that can be conceived. The impostor therefore must have been extremely  ignorant of his art. The examination was made by the cavalier Gio. da  Lazara, Abate Mauro Boni, Bartolommeo Gamba, names sufficiently known to  the public to justify our adoption of their opinion. The very able  Brandolese has likewise pronounced the inscription false, and published  thereon a little work, entitled \"_Doubts respecting the existence of  such a painter as Giovanni Vivarino da Murano, newly confirmed; and a  refutation of some recently asserted authority, to confirm them_.\" And  in this he displays much"]]]
