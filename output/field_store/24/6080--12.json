He stooped as he spoke, and gently lifting Otto from his rude and rugged  bed he drew his broad leathern belt around them both, buckling it firmly  and securely. \"It does not hurt thee?\" said he.    \"Not much,\" whispered Otto faintly.    Then Hans spat upon his hands, and began slowly climbing the rope.    They reached the edge of the window and there they rested for a moment,  and Otto renewed his hold around the neck of the faithful Hans.    \"And now art thou ready?\" said Hans    \"Aye,\" said Otto.    \"Then courage,\" said Hans, and he turned and swung his leg over the  abyss below.    The next moment they were hanging in mid-air.    Otto looked down and gave a gasp. \"The mother of heaven bless us,\" he  whispered, and then closed his eyes, faint and dizzy at the sight of  that sheer depth beneath. Hans said nothing, but shutting his teeth  and wrapping his legs around the rope, he began slowly descending, hand  under hand. Down, down, down he went, until to Otto, with his eyes shut  and his head leaning upon Hans' shoulder, it seemed as though it could  never end. Down, down, down. Suddenly he felt Hans draw a deep breath;  there was a slight jar, and Otto opened his eyes; Hans was standing upon  the ground.    A figure wrapped in a dark cloak arose from the shadow of the wall, and  took Otto in its arms. It was Baron Conrad.    \"My son--my little child!\" he cried, in a choked, trembling voice, and  that was all. And Otto pressed his cheek against his father's and began  crying.    Suddenly the Baron gave a sharp, fierce cry. \"Dear Heaven!\" he cried;  \"what have they done to thee?\" But poor little Otto could not answer.    \"Oh!\" gasped the Baron, in a strangled voice, \"my little child! my  little child!\" And therewith he broke down, and his whole body shook  with fierce, dry sobs; for men in those days did not seek to hide their  grief as they do now, but were fierce and strong in the expression of  that as of all else.    \"Never mind, dear father,\" whispered Otto; \"it did not hurt me so very  much,\" and he pressed his lips against his father's cheek.    Little Otto had but one hand.          XII. A Ride For Life.    But not yet was Otto safe, and all danger past and gone by. Suddenly, as  they stood there, the harsh clangor of a bell broke the silence of  the starry night above their heads, and as they raised their faces and  looked up, they saw lights flashing from window to window. Presently  came the sound of a hoarse voice shouting something that, from the  distance, they could not understand.    One-eyed Hans smote his hand upon his thigh. Look said he, \"here is  what comes of having a soft heart in one's bosom. I overcame and bound a  watchman up yonder, and forced him to tell me where our young Baron lay.  It was on my mind to run my knife into him after he had told me every  thing, but then, bethinking how the young Baron hated the thought of  bloodshed, I said to myself, 'No, Hans, I will spare the villain's  life.' See now what comes of being merciful; here, by hook or by crook,  the fellow has loosed himself from his bonds, and brings the whole  castle about our ears like a nest of wasps.\"    \"We must fly,\" said the Baron; \"for nothing else in the world is  left me, now that all have deserted me in this black time of trouble,  excepting these six faithful ones.\"    His voice was bitter, bitter, as he spoke; then stooping, he raised Otto  in his arms, and bearing him gently, began rapidly descending the rocky  slope to the level road that ran along the edge of the hill beneath.  Close behind him followed the rest; Hans still grimed with soot and in  his bare feet. A little distance from the road and under the shade of  the forest trees, seven horses stood waiting. The Baron mounted upon  his great black charger, seating little Otto upon the saddle in front of  him. \"Forward!\" he cried, and away they clattered and out upon the road.  Then--\"To St. Michaelsburg,\" said Baron Conrad, in his deep voice, and  the horses' heads were turned to the westward, and away they galloped  through the black shadows of the forest, leaving Trutz-Drachen behind  them.    But still the sound of the alarm bell rang through the beating of the  horses' hoofs, and as Hans looked over his shoulder, he saw the light  of torches flashing hither and thither along the outer walls in front of  the great barbican.    In Castle Trutz-Drachen all was confusion and uproar: flashing torches  lit up the dull gray walls; horses neighed and stamped, and men shouted  and called to one another in the bustle of making ready. Presently Baron  Henry came striding along the corridor clad in light armor, which he had  hastily donned when roused from his sleep by the news that his prisoner  had escaped. Below in the courtyard his horse was standing, and without  waiting for assistance, he swung himself into the saddle. Then away they  all rode and down the steep path, armor ringing, swords clanking, and  iron-shod hoofs striking sparks of fire from the hard stones. At their  head rode Baron Henry; his triangular shield hung over his shoulder, and  in his hand he bore a long, heavy, steel-pointed lance with a pennant  flickering darkly from the end.    At the high-road at the base of the slope they paused, for they were at  a loss to know which direction the fugitives had taken; a half a score  of the retainers leaped from their horses, and began hurrying about  hither and thither, and up and down, like hounds searching for the lost  scent, and all the time Baron Henry sat still as a rock in the midst of  the confusion.    Suddenly a shout was raised from the forest just beyond the road; they  had come upon the place where the horses had been tied. It was an easy  matter to trace the way that Baron Conrad and his followers had taken  thence back to the high-road, but there again they were at a loss. The  road ran straight as an arrow eastward and westward--had the fugitives  taken their way to the east or to the west?    Baron Henry called his head-man, Nicholas Stein, to him, and the  two spoke together for a while in an undertone. At last the Baron's  lieutenant reined his horse back, and choosing first one and then  another, divided the company into two parties. The baron placed himself  at the head of one band and Nicholas Stein at the head of the other.  \"Forward!\" he cried, and away clattered the two companies of horsemen in  opposite directions.    It was toward the westward that Baron Henry of Trutz-Drachen rode at the  head of his men.    The early springtide sun shot its rays of misty, yellow light across the  rolling tops of the forest trees where the little birds were singing in  the glory of the May morning. But Baron Henry and his followers thought  nothing of the beauty of the peaceful day, and heard nothing of the  multitudinous sound of the singing birds as, with a confused sound of  galloping hoofs, they swept along the highway, leaving behind them a  slow-curling, low-trailing cloud of dust.    As the sun rose more full and warm, the misty wreaths began to dissolve,  until at last they parted and rolled asunder like a white curtain and  there, before the pursuing horsemen, lay the crest of the mountain  toward which they were riding, and up which the road wound steeply.    \"Yonder they are,\" cried a sudden voice behind Baron Henry of  Trutz-Drachen, and at the cry all looked upward.    Far away upon the mountain-side curled a cloud of dust, from the midst  of which came the star-like flash of burnished armor gleaming in the  sun.    Baron Henry said never a word, but his lips curled in a grim smile.    And as the mist wreaths parted One-eyed Hans looked behind and down  into the leafy valley beneath. \"Yonder they come,\" said he. \"They have  followed sharply to gain so much upon us, even though our horses are  wearied with all the travelling we have done hither and yon these five  days past. How far is it, Lord Baron, from here to Michaelsburg?\"    \"About ten leagues,\" said the Baron, in a gloomy voice.    Hans puckered his mouth as though to whistle, but the Baron saw nothing  of it, for he was gazing straight before him with a set and stony face.  Those who followed him looked at one another, and the same thought was  in the mind of each--how long would it be before those who pursued would  close the distance between them?    When that happened it meant death to one and all.    They reached the crest of the hill, and down they dashed upon the other  side; for there the road was smooth and level as it sloped away into the  valley, but it was in dead silence that they rode. Now and then those  who followed the Baron looked back over their shoulders. They had gained  a mile upon their pursuers when the helmeted heads rose above the crest  of the mountain, but what was the gain of a mile with a smooth road  between them, and fresh horses to weary ones?    On they rode and on they rode. The sun rose higher and higher, and  hotter and hotter. There was no time to rest and water their panting  horses. Only once, when they crossed a shallow stretch of water, the  poor animals bent their heads and caught a few gulps from the cool  stream, and the One-eyed Hans washed a part of the soot from his hands  and face. On and on they rode; never once did the Baron Conrad move his  head or alter that steadfast look as, gazing straight before him, he  rode steadily forward along the endless stretch of road, with poor  little Otto's yellow head and white face resting against his steel-clad  shoulder--and St. Michaelsburg still eight leagues away.    A little rise of ground lay before them, and as they climbed it, all,  excepting the baron, turned their heads as with one accord and looked  behind them. Then more than one heart failed, for through the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28681"],[0,"The Cook's Oracle; and Housekeeper's Manual (#13)"],[1,"be evident, to all who will  consider how much easier it is to return any thing when done with to its  proper place, than it is to find it when mislaid; and it is as easy to  put things in one place as in another.    Keep your kitchen and furniture as clean and neat as possible, which  will then be an ornament to it, a comfort to your fellow-servants, and  a credit to yourself. Moreover, good housewifery is the best  recommendation to a good husband, and engages men to honourable  attachment to you; she who is a tidy servant gives promise of being a  careful wife.      _Giving away Victuals._    Giving away any thing without consent or privity of your master or  mistress, is a liberty you must not take; charity and compassion for the  wants of our fellow-creatures are very amiable virtues, but they are not  to be indulged at the expense of your own honesty, and other people's  property.    When you find that there is any thing to spare, and that it is in danger  of being spoiled by being kept too long, it is very commendable in you  to ask leave to dispose of it while it is fit for Christians to eat: if  such permission is refused, the sin does not lie at your door. But you  must on no account bestow the least morsel in contradiction to the will  of those to whom it belongs.    \"Never think any part of your business too trifling to be well done.\"    \"Eagerly embrace every opportunity of learning any thing which may be  useful to yourself, or of doing any thing which may benefit others.\"    Do not throw yourself out of a good place for a slight affront. \"Come  when you are called, and do what you are bid.\" Place yourself in your  mistress's situation, and consider what you would expect from her, if  she were in yours; and serve, reverence, and obey her accordingly.    Although there may be \"more places than parish-churches,\" it is not very  easy to find many more good ones.      \"A rolling stone never gathers moss.\"    \"Honesty is the best policy.\"    \"A still tongue makes a wise head.\"    _Saucy answers_ are highly aggravating, and answer no good purpose.    Let your master or mistress scold ever so much, or be ever so  unreasonable; as \"a soft answer turneth away wrath,\" \"so will SILENCE be  _the best a servant can make_\".    _One rude answer_, extorted perhaps by harsh words, or unmerited  censure, has cost many a servant the loss of a good place, or the total  forfeiture of a regard which had been growing for years.    \"If your employers are hasty, and have scolded without reason, bear it  patiently; they will soon see their error, and not be happy till they  make you amends. Muttering on leaving the room, or slamming the door  after you, is as bad as an impertinent reply; it is, in fact, showing  that you would be impertinent if you dared.\"    \"A faithful servant will not only never speak disrespectfully _to_ her  employers, but will not hear disrespectful words said _of_ them.\"    Apply direct to your employers, and beg of them to explain to you, as  fully as possible, how they like their victuals dressed, whether much or  little done.[50-*]    Of what complexion they wish the ROASTS, of a gold colour, or well  browned, and if they like them frothed?    Do they like SOUPS and SAUCES thick or thin, or white or brown, clean or  full in the mouth? What accompaniments they are partial to?    What flavours they fancy? especially of SPICE and HERBS:        \"Namque coquus domini debet habere gulam.\"--MARTIAL.    It is impossible that the most accomplished cook can please their  palates, till she has learned their particular taste: this, it will  hardly be expected, she can hit exactly the first time; however, the  hints we have here given, and in the 7th and 8th chapters of the  Rudiments of Cookery, will very much facilitate the ascertainment of  this main chance of getting into their favour.    Be extremely cautious of seasoning high: leave it to the eaters to add  the piquante condiments, according to their own palate and fancy: for  this purpose, \"THE MAGAZINE OF TASTE,\" or \"_Sauce-box_,\" (No. 462,) will  be found an invaluable acquisition; its contents will instantaneously  produce any flavour that may be desired.        \"De gustibus non est disputandum.\"    Tastes are as different as faces; and without a most attentive  observation of the directions given by her employers, the most  experienced cook will never be esteemed a profound palatician.    It will not go far to pacify the rage of a ravenous _gourmand_, who  likes his chops broiled brown, (and done enough, so that they can appear  at table decently, and not blush when they are cut,) to be told that  some of the customers at Dolly's chop-house choose to have them only  half-done, and that this is the best way of eating them.    We all think that is the best way which we relish best, and which agrees  best with our stomach: in this, reason and fashion, all-powerful as they  are on most occasions, yield to the imperative caprice of the palate.      _Chacun a son gout._      \"THE IRISHMAN loves _Usquebaugh_, the SCOT loves ale call'd _Blue-cap_,    The WELCHMAN he loves _toasted cheese_, and makes his mouth like a    mouse-trap.\"    Our ITALIAN neighbours regale themselves with _macaroni_ and _parmesan_,  and eat some things which we call _carrion_.--Vide RAY'S _Travels_, p.  362 and 406.    While the ENGLISHMAN boasts of his _roast beef, plum pudding, and  porter_,    The FRENCHMAN feeds on his favourite _frog and soupe-maigre_,    The TARTAR feasts on _horse-flesh_,    The CHINAMAN on _dogs_,    The GREENLANDER preys on _garbage_ and _train oil_; and each \"blesses  his stars, and thinks it luxury.\" What at one time or place is  considered as beautiful, fragrant, and savoury, at another is regarded  as deformed and disgustful.[51-*]    \"Ask _a toad_ what is beauty, the supremely beautiful, the ~TO KALON~!  He will tell you it is _my wife_,--with two large eyes projecting out of  her little head, a broad and flat neck, yellow belly, and dark brown  back. With _a Guinea negro_, it is a greasy black skin, hollow eyes, and  a flat nose. Put the question to the _devil_, and he will tell you that  BEAUTY is a pair of horns, four claws, and a tail.\"--VOLTAIRE'S _Philos.  Dict._ 8vo. p. 32.    \"_Asafoetida_ was called by the ancients 'FOOD FOR THE GODS.' The  Persians, Indians, and other Eastern people, now eat it in sauces, and  call it by that name: the Germans call it _devil's dung_.\"--_Vide_ POMET  _on Drugs_.    Garlic and clove, or allspice, combined in certain proportions, produce  a flavour very similar to asafoetida.    The organ of taste is more rarely found in perfection, and is sooner  spoiled by the operations of time, excessive use, &c. than either of our  other senses.    There are as various degrees of sensibility of palate as there are of  gradations of perfection in the eyes and ears of painters and musicians.  After all the pains which the editor has taken to explain the harmony of  subtle relishes, unless nature has given the organ of taste in a due  degree, this book will, alas! no more make an OSBORNE,[52-*] than it  can a REYNOLDS, or an ARNE, or a SHIELD.    Where nature has been most bountiful of this faculty, its sensibility is  so easily blunted by a variety of unavoidable circumstances, that the  tongue is very seldom in the highest condition for appreciating delicate  flavours, or accurately estimating the relative force of the various  materials the cook employs in the composition of an harmonious relish.  Cooks express this refinement of combination by saying, a well-finished  _ragout_ \"tastes of every thing, and tastes of nothing:\" (this is  \"_kitchen gibberish_\" for a sauce in which the component parts are well  proportioned.)    However delicately sensitive nature may have formed the organs of taste,  it is only during those few happy moments that they are perfectly awake,  and in perfect good humour, (alas! how very seldom they are,) that the  most accomplished and experienced cook has a chance of working with any  degree of certainty without the auxiliary tests of the balance and the  measure: by the help of these, when you are once right, it is your own  fault if you are ever otherwise.    The sense of taste depends much on the health of the individual, and is  hardly ever for a single hour in the same state: such is the extremely  intimate sympathy between the stomach and the tongue, that in proportion  as the former is empty, the latter is acute and sensitive. This is the  cause that \"good appetite is the best sauce,\" and that the dish we find  savoury at _luncheon_, is insipid at _dinner_, and at _supper_ quite  tasteless.    To taste any thing in perfection, the tongue must be moistened, or the  substance applied to it contain moisture; the nervous papillae which  constitute this sense are roused to still more lively sensibility by  salt, sugar, aromatics, &c.    If the palate becomes dull by repeated tasting, one of the best ways of  refreshing it, is to masticate an apple, or to wash your mouth well with  milk.    The incessant exercise of tasting, which a cook is obliged to submit to  during the education of her tongue, frequently impairs the very faculty  she is trying to improve. \"'Tis true 'tis pity and pity 'tis,\" (says a  _grand gourmand_) \"'tis true, her too anxious perseverance to penetrate  the mysteries of palatics may diminish the _tact_, exhaust the power,  and destroy the _index_, without which all her labour is in vain.\"    Therefore, a sagacious cook, instead of idly and wantonly wasting the  excitability of her palate, on the sensibility of which her reputation  and fortune depends, when she has ascertained the relative strength of  the flavour of the various ingredients she employs, will call in the  balance and the measure to do the ordinary business, and endeavour to  preserve her organ of taste with the utmost care, that it may be a  faithful oracle to refer to on grand occasions, and new"]]]
