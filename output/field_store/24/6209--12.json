[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36970"],[0,"The Confessions of a Poacher (#13)"],[1,"e. Poaching was right by the Bible, but wrong by the  law,\"--and so he was rushing on. One of the Justices deigned to remark  that it was a question of \"property\" not morality. \"Oh!\" rejoined the  \"Otter,\" \"because blue blood doesn't run in my veins that's no reason  why I shouldn't have my share. But it's a queer kind of property that's  yours in that field, mine on the turnpike, and a third man's over the  next fence.\" The end of it was, however, a fine of L5, with an  alternative. And so the case ended. But that day the keepers and their  assistants had forgotten the first principles of watching. The best  keeper is the one that is the least seen. Only let the poacher know his  whereabouts, and the latter's work is easy. It was afterwards remarked  that during our trial not a poacher was in court. To any keeper skilled  in his craft this fact must have appeared unusual--and significant. It  became even more so when both of us were released by reason of our heavy  fine having been paid the same evening. Most of the keepers had had  their day out, and were making the most of it. Had their heads not been  muddled they might have seen more than one woman labouring under loaded  baskets near the local game dealers; these innocently covered with  mantling cresses, and so, at the time, escaping suspicion. Upon the  memorable day the pheasants had been fed by unseen hands--and had  vanished. The only traces left by the covert side were fluffy feathers  everywhere. Few hares remained on the land; the rest had either been  snared or netted at the gates. The rabbits' burrows had been ferreted,  the ferrets having been slyly borrowed at the keeper's cottage during  his absence for the occasion. I may say that, in connection with this  incident, we always claimed to poach square, and drew the line at  home-reared pheasants--allowing them \"property.\" Those found wild in the  woods were on a different footing, and we directed our whole knowledge  of woodcraft against them.    Here is another \"court\" incident, in which I and my companion played a  part. We came in contact with the law just sufficient to make us know  something of its bearings. When charged with being in possession of  \"game\" we reiterated the old argument that rabbits were vermin--but it  rarely stood us in good stead. On one occasion, however, we scored.  Being committed for two months for \"night poaching,\" we respectfully  informed the presiding Justice that, at the time of our capture, the sun  had risen an hour; and further, that the law did not allow more than  half the sentence just passed upon us. Our magistrate friend--to whom I  have more than once referred--was on the bench, and he told his brother  Justices that he thought there was something in the contention. The old  Clerk looked crabbed as he fumbled for his horn spectacles, and, after  turning over a book called \"Stone's Justices' Manual,\" he solemnly  informed the bench that defendants in their interpretation were right.  We naturally remember this little incident, and as the law has had the  whip hand of us upon so many occasions, chuckle over it.    We invariably made friends with the stone-breakers by the road-sides,  and just as invariably carried about us stone-breakers' hammers, and  \"preserves\" for the eyes. When hard pressed, and if unknown to the  pursuing keeper, nothing is easier than to dismiss the dog, throw off  one's coat, plump down upon the first stone heap on the road, and go to  work. If the thing is neatly done, and the \"preserves\" cover the face,  it is wonderful how often this ruse is successful. The keeper may put a  hasty question, but he oftener rushes after his man. Mention of  stone-heaps reminds me of the fact that they are better \"hides\" for nets  than almost anything else, especially the larger unbroken heaps. We  invariably hid our big cumbrous fishing nets beneath them, and the  stones were just as invariably true to their trust.    Going back to my earliest poaching days I remember a cruel incident  which had a very different ending to what its author intended. A young  keeper had made a wager that he would effect my capture within a certain  number of days, and my first intimation of this fact was a sickening  sight which I discovered in passing down a woodland glade just at dawn  on a bright December morning. I heard a groan, and a few yards in front  saw a man stretched across the ride. His clothes were covered with hoar  frost, he was drenched in blood, and the poor fellow's pale face showed  me that of the keeper. He was held fast in a man-trap which had terribly  lacerated his lower limbs. He was conscious, but quite exhausted.  Although in great agony he suffered me to carry him to a neighbouring  hay-rick, from whence we removed him to his cottage. He recovered  slowly, and the man-trap which he had set the night before was, I  believe, the last ever used in that district.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    Chapter 11.    PERSONAL ENCOUNTERS.      When I had finished the last chapter I thought I had completed my work,  but the gentleman who is to edit these \"Confessions\" now tells me that I  am to confess more. He reminds me that I cannot have been an active  poacher nearly all my life without having had numerous personal  encounters with keepers and others. And in this he is right. But there  is some difficulty in my additional task for the following reasons: I  have never cared to take much credit to myself for having broken the  head of a keeper, and there is but little pleasure to me in recounting  the occasions when keepers have broken mine. However, speaking of broken  heads reminds me of an incident which was amusing, though, at the time,  somewhat painful to me.    One night in November when the trees were bare, and the pheasants had  taken to the branches, we were in a mixed wood of pine and beech. A good  many birds roosted on its confines, and, to a practised eye, were not  difficult to see against the moon as they sat on the lower limbs of the  trees, near the trunks. I and my companion had old, strong guns with  barrels filed down, and, as we got very near to the birds, we were using  small charges of powder. As the night was windy the shots would not be  heard very far, and we felt fairly safe. When we had obtained about  three brace of birds, however, I heard a sudden crash among the  underwood, when I immediately jumped behind the bole of a tree, and kept  closely against it.    The head-keeper had my companion down before he could resist, and I only  remained undiscovered for a few seconds. One of the under-keepers seized  me, but, being a good wrestler, I soon threw him into a dense brake of  brambles and blackthorn. Then I bolted with the third man close behind.  I could easily have outrun him over the rough country that lay outside  the wood, but--ah! these \"buts\"--there was a stiff stone fence fully  five feet high betwixt me and the open. Unless I could \"fly\" the fence  he would have me. I clutched my pockets, steadied myself for the  leap--and then sprang. I heard my pursuer stop for a second to await the  issue. Weighted as I was I caught the coping, and fell back heavily into  the wood. As soon as the keeper saw I was down he rushed forward and hit  me heavily on the head with a stave. The sharp corner cut right through  the skin, and blood spurted out in little jets. Then I turned about,  determined to close with my opponent if he was inclined for further  roughness. But he was not. When he saw that the blood was almost  blinding me he dropped his hedge-stake, and ran, apparently terrified at  what he had done. I leaned for a few moments against the wall, then  dragged myself over, and started for a stream which ran down the field.  But I felt weaker at every step, and soon crept into a bed of tall  brackens, and plugged the wound in my head with a handful of wet moss,  keeping it in position with my neckerchief. After this I munched some  bread and hard cheese, sucked the dew from the fern fronds, and then  fell into a broken sleep. I must have slept for four or five hours, when  I woke thirsty and feverish, and very weak. I tried to walk, but again  and again fell down. Then I crawled for about a hundred yards, but this  caused my wound to bleed afresh, and I fainted. Just as day was coming a  farm labourer came across, and kindly helped me to his cottage. He and  his wife bathed my head and eyes, and then assisted me to the bed from  which they had just risen. At noon I was able to take some bread and  milk, and at night, an hour after darkness had fallen, I was able to  start for home.    Well, the sequel came in due time. We each received a summons (my  companion had been released after identification), we were tried in  about a fortnight from the date of our capture. There was a full bench  of Magistrates; my companion pleaded guilty (with a view to a lenient  sentence); myself--not guilty. In the first instance the case was clear,  but not one of the three keepers (to their credit) would swear to me.  They looked me carefully over, particularly my assailant. He was  reminded that it was a fine, moonlight night. Yes, but his man, he  thought, was taller, was more strongly built, and looked pale and  haggard--no, he would not say that I was the man--in short, he thought I  was not. Then came my innings. The keeper had sworn that, after running  a mile, the poacher he chased had turned on him, and threatened to \"do  for him,\" if he advanced; that he had hit him on the head with his  stick, and must have wounded him severely. He was also careful to  explain that he had done this in \"self defence.\" I then pointed out to  the \"bench\" that it was no longer a matter of opinion; that I claimed to  have my head examined, and asked that the Police Superintendent, who was  conducting the case, should settle the point.    But my assumption of an air of injured innocence had already done its  work, and the presiding"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36974"],[0,"Old Trails on the Niagara Frontier (#13)"],[1," matter. Over and over again  in the correspondence which I have examined, one finds vigorous  condemnation of the Indian method of slaughter of women and children,  and the torture of captives. Over and over again the officers are urged  not to allow it; and over and over again they report, after a raid, that  they deplore the acts of wantonness which were committed, and which they  were unable to prevent. But nowhere do I find any suggestion that the  services of the Indians be dispensed with. Throughout the Revolution,  the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas and Delawares--for the last, also, were  often at Fort Niagara--were sent against the Americans, by the British.  The Oneidas, as is well known, were divided and vacillating in their  allegiance. In August, 1780, 132 of them who hitherto had been  ostensibly friendly to the Americans, were induced to go to Niagara and  give their pledges to the British. When they arrived Guy Johnson put on  a severe front and censured them for their lack of steadfastness to the  King. According to him, some 500 Oneidas in all came to the fort that  year and declared themselves ready to fight the Americans. The last  party that arrived delivered up to the Superintendent a commission  which, he says, \"the Rebels had issued with a view to form the Oneidas  into a corps, ... they also delivered up to me the Rebel flag.\"    So far as I am aware this is the first mention of the Stars and Stripes  on the banks of the Niagara. By resolution of June 14, 1777, the  American Congress had decreed \"That the flag of the thirteen United  States be thirteen stripes alternate red and white; that the union be  thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new  constellation.\" A little over three years had passed since John Paul  Jones had first flung to the breeze, at the mast of his ship Ranger,  this bright banner of the new nation. It was not to appear in a British  port for two and a half years to come; sixteen years were to pass before  it could fly triumphant over the old walls of Fort Niagara; but France  had saluted it, Americans were fighting for it, and although it is first  found here in hostile hands, yet I like to reckon from that August day  in 1780, the beginning, if in prophecy only, of the reign of that new  constellation over the Niagara region.    Col. Bolton's life at Fort Niagara was one of infinite care. Besides the  routine of the garrison, he was constantly harrassed by the demands of  the Indians, whom the British did not wish to feed, but whom they dared  not offend. The old fort, which now sleeps so quietly at the mouth of  the river, was a busy place in those days. There was constant coming and  going. Schooners, snows[12] and batteaux with provisions from Quebec, or  with munitions of war or detachments of troops for Detroit or  Michillimackinac, were constantly arriving. I question if the lower  Niagara were not busier in that period than it is now. The transfer of  supplies around the falls--the \"great portage\"--was hard and tedious  work. Not Quebec, but Great Britain, was the real base of supplies.  There were many detentions, and constant interruption in shipment, at  every stage of the way. Sometimes a cargo of salt pork from Ireland or  flour from London would reach Quebec too late in the summer to admit of  transfer to the posts until spring. Sometimes, in crossing Lake Ontario,  the provisions would be damaged so as to be unfit for use; sometimes  they would be lost. Then not only the garrison at Niagara had to face  starvation, but Col. Bolton soon had his ears ringing with messages and  maledictions from Detroit and Mackinac, buried still farther in the  wilderness, and all looking to Niagara for food and clothing. At such  times of distress the upper posts questioned whether goods intended for  them were not irregularly held at Niagara; the meanwhile, Col. Bolton  would be straining every effort to get provisions enough to keep his own  command from starvation. Indian supplies and traders' goods, too, were  liable to loss and detention; and on very slight provocation, the  demands of the Indians grew insolent.    There were constant desertions, too, among the troops. Indeed, there  seems never to have been a time at Fort Niagara when desertions were not  frequent, and, more than once, so numerous as to threaten the very  existence of the garrison. This, however, not in Bolton's time. As the  correspondence shows, he enjoyed the utmost confidence of his superiors,  and there is nothing to indicate that his men were not as devoted to him  as any officer could expect at a frontier post where service meant hard  work and possible starvation.    Frequent as had been the raids against the settlements before the  expedition of Sullivan, they became thereafter even more frequent; and,  if less disastrous, they were so merely because the American frontier  settlements had already paid their utmost tribute to Butler and Brant.  The expeditions, along certain much-worn trails, had to go farther and  farther in order to find foes to attack or cattle to steal. This was  especially so in the valleys of the Mohawk and Susquehanna; yet in one  quarter and another this border warfare went on, and there is no lack of  evidence, in the official correspondence, of its effectiveness. Thus,  writing from Fort Niagara, August 24, 1780, Guy Johnson reports: \"I have  the pleasure to inform your excellency that the partys who subdivided  after Capt. Brant's success at the Cleysburg\"--an expedition which he  had previously reported--\"have all been successful; that Capt. Brant  has destroyed twenty houses in Schoharie and taken and killed twelve  persons, besides releasing several women and children. Among the  prisoners is Lieut. Vrooman, the settlement of that name being that  which was destroyed. The other divisions of that party have been also  successful, particularly Capt. David's party, and the number of killed  and taken by them within that time, so far as it has come to my hands,  is, killed, thirty-five, taken, forty-six, released, forty.... The  remaining inhabitants on the frontiers are drawing in so as to deprive  the rebels of any useful resources from them. I have at present on  service, several partys that set out within one and the same week, and I  apprehend that falling on the frontiers in different places at the same  time will have a good effect.\" September 18th he writes, telling of the  destruction of \"Kleysberg,\" \"containing a church, 100 houses and as many  barnes, besides mills and 500 cattle and horses.\" In the same letter he  wrote: \"I have now 405 warriors out in different parties and quarters,  exclusive of some marched from Kadaragawas.... The greater part of the  rest are at their planting grounds, and many sick here, as fevers and  fluxes have for some time prevailed at this Post.\" October 1st he  reports the number of men in the war parties sent out from Fort Niagara  as 892. A return, dated June 30, 1781, shows that the war parties \"have  killed and taken during the season already 150 persons.\" September 30th  he reports an expedition under Walter Johnson and Montour, in which  about \"twenty rebels\" were killed; and on that day Capt. Nelles arrived  with eleven prisoners taken in Pennsylvania. A postscript to this letter  says: \"Since writing, I have received the disagreeable news of the death  of the gallant Montour, who died of the wounds he received in the action  before related. He was a chief of the greatest spirit and readiness, and  his death is a loss.\" We can well believe that; for Montour, who, from  the American view-point, had the reputation of being a fiend incarnate,  had indeed shown \"spirit and readiness\" in stealing cattle, burning log  cabins, killing and scalping their occupants or bringing them captive to  Fort Niagara.    In another paper[13] I have stated that I have traced out the individual  experiences in captivity of thirty-two of these Americans, who were  taken by the Indians and British and brought as prisoners to Fort  Niagara. How much might be done on this line may be judged from a review  of Col. Johnson's transactions, furnished by that officer at Montreal,  March 24, 1782, in which it is stated that the number of Americans  killed and taken captive by parties from Fort Niagara, amounted at that  time to near 900. The time was rife with like experiences. For instance,  there was the famous raid on Cherry Valley, from which Mrs. Jane  Campbell and her four children, after a long detention among the  Indians, were brought to Fort Niagara. There was Jane Moore, who was  also taken at Cherry Valley, and who subsequently was married to Capt.  Powell of the Niagara garrison in the winter of 1779--the ceremony, by  the Church of England service, so impressing Joseph Brant that he  immediately led up to the minister the squaw with whom he had been  living for a long time, and insisted on being married over again, white  man's fashion. There was Lieut. Col. Stacia, another prisoner from  Cherry Valley, whose head Molly Brant wanted for a football. Some of the  stories of these captives, like that of Alexander Harper, who ran the  gauntlet at Fort Niagara (the ordeal apparently being made light in his  case), are familiar to readers of our history; others, I venture to say,  are unknown. For instance, there were John and Robert Brice, two little  boys, who were taken in 1779 near Rensselaerville by a scouting party,  and brought, with other prisoners and eight scalps, to Fort Niagara. But  they did not come together. Robert, who was but eleven years old, was  taken to Fort Erie and sold to a lake sailor for the sum of L3. This  little Son of the Revolution was kept on the upper lakes until 1783,  when he was summoned to Fort Niagara where he met his brother John, from  whom he had parted near the mouth of the Unadilla River some four years  before. They were sent to Montreal with nearly 200 liberated captives,"]]]
