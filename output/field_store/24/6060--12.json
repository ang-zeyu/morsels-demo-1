The female is also infinitely more valuable than the cow, from  the very much greater quantity of milk she yields.\" The hide is also  much valued for its strength and durability.    In India they are used as beasts of burden; but the nature of the goods  they carry must be such as will not suffer from being wet, as they have  an invincible propensity to lie down in water. The native princes use  them to fight with tigers in their public shows; and from their fierce  and active nature, when excited, they frequently prove more than a match  for their formidable assailants. With the native herdsman, however, they  are generally docile: these men ride on their favorites, and spend the  night with them in the midst of jungles and forests, without fear of  wild beasts. When driven along, the herds keep close together, so that  the driver, if necessary, walks from the back of one to the other,  perfectly at his ease. In the south of Europe they are managed by means  of a ring passed through the cartilage of the nose, but in India it is a  mere rope.    Their fierceness and courage are well exemplified in the following  anecdote, related by Mr. D. Johnson in his interesting 'Sketches of  Indian Field Sports:' \"Two Biparies, or carriers of grain and  merchandise on the backs of bullocks, were driving a loaded string of  these animals from Palamow to Chittrah: when they were come within a few  miles of the latter place, a tiger seized on the man in the rear, which  was seen by a Guallah (herdsman), as he was watching his Buffaloes  grazing. He boldly ran up to the man's assistance, and cut the tiger  severely with his sword; upon which he dropped the Biparie, and seized  the herdsman. The Buffaloes observing it, attacked the tiger, and  rescued the herdsman; they tossed him about from one to the other, and,  to the best of my recollection, killed him. Both the wounded men were  brought to me; the Biparie recovered, and the herdsman died.\"    Speaking of the Buffalo at Malabar, Dillon says, \"It is an ugly animal,  almost destitute of hair, goes slowly, but carries very heavy burdens.  Herds may be seen, as of common cows; and they afford milk, which serves  to make butter and cheese. Their flesh is good, though less delicate,  than that of the ox: the animal swims perfectly well, and traverses the  broadest rivers. Besides the tame ones, there are wild Buffaloes, which  are extremely dangerous, tearing men to pieces, or crushing them with a  single blow of the head; they are less to be dreaded in woods than  elsewhere, because their horns often catch in the branches, and give  time for the persons pursued to escape by flight. The skins of these  animals serve for an infinity of purposes, and even cruses are made of  them for holding water or liquors. The animals on the coast of Malabar  are all wild, and strangers are not prevented from hunting them for  their flesh.\"    Whether the animals alluded to, in all these cases, constitute only one  species, or consist of several, the accounts which have been given of  them (from their vagueness and want of precision) afford no means of  deciding.    The following tail-piece is a representation of the Herefordshire Cow,  _Bos Taurus_.    [Illustration]          The Manilla Buffalo.    _Bos Bubalis?_      [Illustration]    The animal which is represented in the above engraving, was living in  the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park, in 1846, at which time the sketch  was taken.    In size the Manilla Buffalo is about equal to the Kyloe Ox. The horns  are of a similar shape, and take nearly the same direction, as those of  the Italian Buffalo. They differ, however, from the horns of the Italian  Buffalo in three particulars: first, in not being above half so thick or  bulky; second, in having a much larger curve; and third, in being  considerably more compressed, which compression exists throughout their  entire length: the colour of the upper surface of the horn is lightish,  on the lower side nearly black. The head is narrow, and the muzzle fine;  the ears are long and nearly naked; the eyes large and bright, with a  peculiarly timid and suspicious expression. The limbs are slender, and  indeed the whole frame is slight, and seems to betoken greater speed  than strength.    We have a notable example of the uncertainty of framing generic  characters, before the peculiar attributes of each species are known,  in Griffiths' work, already referred to (vol. iv, p. 382). \"Buffaloes  _in general_\" are there said to possess _strong and solid_ limbs,  _large_ head, _broad_ muzzle, _long_ and slender tail, back _rather_  straight. Here we have an animal (a Buffalo by universal consent) whose  limbs are _slender_, head _small_, muzzle _fine_; whose tail is _not_  long, and whose back is any thing but straight. The Cape Buffalo, also,  (see p. 86,) has _rather_ a small head, its tail is absolutely _short_,  and its back has very considerable curvature.    [Illustration]    The preceding outline of the backs of four Buffaloes will show how  inappropriate the character of a _straight back_ is, when applied to  \"Buffaloes _in general_.\" The lowest outline (5), inserted by way of  contrast, represents the back of the Domestic Ox, to which the character  of straight might very properly be applied. (1) Italian Buffalo. (2)  Manilla Buffalo. (3) Pulo Condore Buffalo. (4) Cape Buffalo.    Generic characters should be such (and such _only_) as will apply to  every species included in the genus.    The period of gestation of the Manilla Buffalo is between forty-eight  and forty-nine weeks. In two actual cases of a female now living in the  Zoological Gardens, the periods were, in the one case, 340 days, in the  other, 341 days; being 70 days longer than the ordinary term of the  domestic Cow.    [Illustration: Head of Manilla Buffalo--female.]          PULO CONDORE BUFFALO.    _Bos Bubalus?_    [Illustration]    Not much is known of the Buffalo which is found in the island of Pulo  Condore. It is related by those navigators who completed the voyage to  the Pacific Ocean, begun by Captain Cook, that when at Pulo Condore,  they procured eight Buffaloes, which were to be conducted to the ships  by means of ropes put through their nostrils and round their horns; but  when they were brought within sight of the sailors, they became so  furious that some of them tore out the cartilage of their nostrils, and  set themselves at liberty. All attempts to get them on board would have  proved fruitless, had it not been for some children, whom the animals  would suffer to approach them, and by whose puerile management their  rage was quickly appeased; and when the animals were brought to the  beach, it was by their assistance, in twisting ropes around their legs,  that the men were enabled to throw them down, and by that means get them  into the boats. And what appears to have been no less singular than this  circumstance was, that they had not been a day on board before they  became perfectly gentle.    Whether this be a distinct species, or merely a variety, we have not, at  present, the least means of ascertaining.    Osteology unknown.    Period of gestation unknown.    The tail-piece below represents a short-horned Bull of the Domestic  species, _Bos Taurus_.    [Illustration]          THE CAPE BUFFALO.    _Bos Caffer._      [Illustration]    This species of ox is only to be found in Africa, and is chiefly  confined to the wooded districts lying north of the Cape of Good Hope.  What Lavater endeavours to prove of the human being, namely, that the  face is the index of the mind or disposition, may be applied, with at  least equal truth, to the Cape Buffalo. His broad, projecting muzzle,  lowering eyebrows, shaggy pendulous ears, surmounted by a pair of huge  horns, give a look of bold determination to this animal, which forms a  tolerably correct index of his character; his firm-set limbs and bulky  body convey a no less adequate idea of his enormous strength.    These animals are gregarious, living in small herds in the brushwoods or  open forests, of Caffraria, occasionally uniting in large droves. Old  bulls are often met with alone; but though they are fiercer than the  young ones, they are less dangerous, because less active, and less  inclined to exertion.    It is worthy of observation, that the males of every species of the  Genus Bos are remarkably bold and courageous, as are likewise the  females when they have calves. It is not, therefore, surprising that the  hunting of this animal should be attended with danger, and frequently  with fatal consequences. The European colonists generally pursue the  sport on horseback; but the Caffers and other natives, who are more  active, and accustomed to the intricacies of the forest, prefer  following the game on foot.    Professor Thunberg, whilst investigating the interior of Caffraria, in  1772, in company with a sergeant and a European gardener, who had  resided in the colony some time, and who acted as guide on the occasion,  met with the following perilous adventure:--    \"We had not advanced far into the wood,\" says the traveller, \"before we  had the misfortune of meeting with a large old male Buffalo, which was  lying down quite alone, in a spot that was free from bushes for the  space of a few square yards. He no sooner discovered Auge, the gardener,  who went first, than, roaring horribly, he rushed upon him. The gardener  turning his horse short round, behind a large tree, by that means got in  some measure out of the Buffalo's sight, which now rushed straight  forward towards the sergeant, who followed next, and gored his horse in  the belly in such a terrible manner, that it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27977"],[0,"Austral English (#13)"],[1,"branches have earned for it the local and expressive  name of `tangle-foot' or `leg ropes.'

Its food is the young leaves of the Eucalyptus,  and it is said that the Native Bear cannot be taken to England  because it would die on board ship, owing to there being no  fresh gum leaves.  The writers are incorrect who call the  animal a sloth.    1827.  P. Cunningham, `Two Years in New South Wales,' vol. i.  p. 317    \"Our coola (sloth or native bear) is about the size of an  ordinary poodle dog, with shaggy, dirty-coloured fur, no tail,  and claws and feet like a bear, of which it forms a tolerable  miniature.  It climbs trees readily and feeds upon their  leaves.\"    1846.  G. H. Haydon, `Five Years in Australia Felix,' p. 57:    \"The bear (phascolomys) of the colonists is in reality a  species of sloth, and partakes of all the characteristics of  that animal; it is of the marsupial order, and is found chiefly  in the neighbourhood of thickly timbered high land; its flesh  is used by the aborigines for food, but is tough and  unpalatable; its usual weight is from eight to twelve pounds.\"  [Note: <i>Phascolomys</i> is the name of the Wombat, not the  Bear.]    1854.

Lumholtz, `Among Cannibals,' p. 9:    \"We learned that a koala or native bear (<i>Phascolarctus  cinereus</i>) was sitting on a tree near the but of a  shepherd . . . not a dangerous animal.  It is called `native  bear,' but is in no wise related to the bear family.  It is an  innocent and peaceful marsupial, which is active only at night,  and sluggishly climbs the trees, eating leaves and sleeping  during the whole day.
