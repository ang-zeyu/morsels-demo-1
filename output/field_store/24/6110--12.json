To prevent those who believed in war from taking part in  it would be as much a violation of liberty of conscience as to force  enlistments among those who had conscientious scruples against it. Nor  would the Quaker majority have any right to compel others to bear arms  and at the same time exempt themselves. Therefore a voluntary militia  system was established under which a fighting Quaker, a Presbyterian, an  Episcopalian, or anybody, could enlist and have all the military glory  he could win.    It was altogether a volunteer system. Two years afterwards, as the  necessities of war increased, the Quaker Assembly passed a rather  stringent compulsory militia bill; but the governor vetoed it, and the  first law with its volunteer system remained in force. Franklin busied  himself to encourage enlistments under it and was very successful.  Though a philosopher and a man of science, almost as much opposed to war  as the Quakers and not even owning a shotgun, he was elected commander  and led a force of about five hundred men to protect the Lehigh Valley.  His common sense seems to have supplied his lack of military training.  He did no worse than some professional soldiers who might be named.  The valley was supposed to be in great danger since its village of  Gnadenhutten had been burned and its people massacred. The Moravians,  like the Quakers, had suddenly found that they were not as much opposed  to war as they had supposed. They had obtained arms and ammunition from  New York and had built stockades, and Franklin was glad to find them so  well prepared when he arrived. He built small forts in different parts  of the valley, acted entirely on the defensive, and no doubt checked the  raids of the Indians at that point. They seem to have been watching  him from the hilltops all the time, and any rashness on his part would  probably have brought disaster upon him. After his force had been  withdrawn, the Indians again attacked and burned Gnadenhutten.    The chain of forts, at first seventeen, afterwards increased to fifty,  built by the Assembly on the Pennsylvania frontier was a good plan so  far as it went, but it was merely defensive and by no means completely  defensive, since Indian raiding parties could pass between the forts.  They served chiefly as refuges for neighboring settlers. The colonial  troops or militia, after manning the fifty forts and sending their quota  to the operations against Canada by way of New England and New York,  were not numerous enough to attack the Indians. They could only act on  the defensive as Franklin's command had done. As for the rangers, as  the small bands of frontiersmen acting without any authority of either  governor or legislature were called, they were very efficient as  individuals but they accomplished very little because they acted at  widely isolated spots. What was needed was a well organized force which  could pursue the Indians on their own ground so far westward that the  settlers on the frontier would be safe. The only troops which could  do this were the British regulars with the assistance of the colonial  militia.    Two energetic efforts to end the war without aid from abroad were made,  however, one by the pacific Quakers and the other by the combatant  portion of the people. Both of these were successful so far as they  went, but had little effect on the general situation. In the summer  of 1756, the Quakers made a very earnest effort to persuade the two  principal Pennsylvania tribes, the Delawares and Shawanoes, to withdraw  from the French alliance and return to their old friends. These two  tribes possessed a knowledge of the country which enabled them greatly  to assist the French designs on Pennsylvania. Chiefs of these tribes  were brought under safe conducts to Philadelphia, where they were  entertained as equals in the Quaker homes. Such progress, indeed, was  made that by the end of July a treaty of peace was concluded at Easton  eliminating those two tribes from the war. This has sometimes been  sneered at as mere Quaker pacifism; but it was certainly successful in  lessening the numbers and effectiveness of the enemy.    The other undertaking was a military one, the famous attack upon  Kittanning conducted by Colonel John Armstrong, an Ulsterman from  Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and the first really aggressive officer the  province had produced. The Indians had two headquarters for their raids  into the province, one at Logstown on the Ohio a few miles below Fort  Duquesne, and the other at Kittanning or, as the French called it,  Attique, about forty miles northeast. At these two points they assembled  their forces, received ammunition and supplies from the French, and  organized their expeditions. As Kittanning was the nearer, Armstrong in  a masterly maneuver took three hundred men through the mountains without  being discovered and, by falling upon the village early in the morning,  he effected a complete surprise. The town was set on fire, the Indians  were put to flight, and large quantities of their ammunition were  destroyed. But Armstrong could not follow up his success. Threatened  by overwhelming numbers, he hastened to withdraw. The effect which the  fighting and the Quaker treaty had on the frontier was good. Incursions  of the savages were, at least for the present, checked. But the root of  the evil had not yet been reached, and the Indians remained massed  along the Ohio, ready to break in upon the people again at the first  opportunity.    The following year, 1757, was the most depressing period of the war.  The proprietors of Pennsylvania took the opportunity to exempt their own  estate from taxation and throw the burden of furnishing money for the  war upon the colonists. Under pressure of the increasing success of the  French and Indians and because the dreadful massacres were coming nearer  and nearer to Philadelphia, the Quaker Assembly yielded, voted the  largest sum they had ever voted to the war, and exempted the proprietary  estates. The colony was soon boiling with excitement. The Churchmen, as  friends of the proprietors, were delighted to have the estates exempted,  thought it a good opportunity to have the Quaker Assembly abolished, and  sent petitions and letters and proofs of alleged Quaker incompetence  to the British Government. The Quakers and a large majority of the  colonists, on the other hand, instead of consenting to their own  destruction, struck at the root of the Churchmen's power by proposing  to abolish the proprietors. And in a letter to Isaac Norris, Benjamin  Franklin, who had been sent to England to present the grievances of the  colonists, even suggested that \"tumults and insurrections that might  prove the proprietary government unable to preserve order, or show the  people to be ungovernable, would do the business immediately.\"    Turmoil and party strife rose to the most exciting heights, and the  details of it might, under certain circumstances, be interesting to  describe. But the next year, 1758, the British Government, by sending  a powerful force of regulars to Pennsylvania, at last adopted the  only method for ending the war. Confidence was at once restored. The  Pennsylvania Assembly now voted the sufficient and, indeed, immense sum  of one hundred thousand pounds, and offered a bounty of five pounds  to every recruit. It was no longer a war of defense but now a war of  aggression and conquest. Fort Duquesne on the Ohio was taken; and the  next autumn Fort Pitt was built on its ruins. Then Canada fell, and  the French empire in America came to an end. Canada and the Great West  passed into the possession of the Anglo-Saxon race.        Chapter VII. The Decline Of Quaker Government    When the treaty of peace was signed in 1763, extinguishing France's  title to Canada and turning over Canada and the Mississippi Valley to  the English, the colonists were prepared to enjoy all the blessings of  peace. But the treaty of peace had been made with France, not with the  red man. A remarkable genius, Pontiac, appeared among the Indians, one  of the few characters, like Tecumseh and Osceola, who are often cited  as proof of latent powers almost equal to the strongest qualities of the  white race. Within a few months he had united all the tribes of the  West in a discipline and control which, if it had been brought to the  assistance of the French six years earlier, might have conquered the  colonies to the Atlantic seaboard before the British regulars could have  come to their assistance. The tribes swept westward into Pennsylvania,  burning, murdering, and leveling every habitation to the ground with a  thoroughness beyond anything attempted under the French alliance. The  settlers and farmers fled eastward to the towns to live in cellars,  camps, and sheds as best they could. * Fortunately the colonies retained  a large part of the military organization, both men and officers, of  the French War, and were soon able to handle the situation. Detroit and  Niagara were relieved by water; and an expedition commanded by Colonel  Bouquet, who had distinguished himself under General Forties, saved Fort  Pitt.          * For an account of Pontiac's conspiracy, see \"The Old Northwest\"  by Frederic A. Ogg (in \"The Chronicles of America\").      At this time the Scotch-Irish frontiersmen suddenly became prominent.  They had been organizing for their own protection and were meeting with  not a little success. They refused to join the expedition of regular  troops marching westward against Pontiac's warriors, because they wanted  to protect their own homes and because they believed the regulars to be  marching to sure destruction. Many of the regular troops were invalided  from the West Indies, and the Scotch-Irish never expected to see any  of them again. They believed that the salvation of Pennsylvania, or at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3050"],[0,"Notes of a War Correspondent (#13)"],[1,"brother correspondents, so I tried to steal away  from the three who were present.  They were Thomas F. Millard, Walstein  Root of the _Sun_, and Horace Thompson.  By dodging through a coffee  _central_ I came out a half mile from them and in advance of the Third  Wisconsin.  There I encountered two \"boy officers,\" Captain John C.  Breckenridge and Lieutenant Fred. S. Titus, who had temporarily abandoned  their thankless duties in the Commissariat Department in order to seek  death or glory in the skirmish-line.  They wanted to know where I was  going, and when I explained, they declared that when Coamo surrendered  they also were going to be among those present.    So we slipped away from the main body and rode off as an independent  organization.  But from the bald ridge, where the artillery was still  hammering the town, the three correspondents and Captain Alfred Paget,  Her Majesty's naval attache, observed our attempt to steal a march on  General Wilson's forces, and pursued us and soon overtook us.    We now were seven, or to be exact, eight, for with Mr. Millard was  \"Jimmy,\" who in times of peace sells papers in Herald Square, and in  times of war carries Mr. Millard's copy to the press post.  We were much  nearer the ford than the bridge, so we waded the \"drift\" and started on a  gallop along the mile of military road that lay between us and Coamo.  The firing from the Sixteenth Pennsylvania had slackened, but as we  advanced it became sharper, more insistent, and seemed to urge us to  greater speed.  Across the road were dug rough rifle-pits which had the  look of having been but that moment abandoned.  What had been intended  for the breakfast of the enemy was burning in pots over tiny fires,  little heaps of cartridges lay in readiness upon the edges of each pit,  and an arm-chair, in which a sentry had kept a comfortable lookout, lay  sprawling in the middle of the road.  The huts that faced it were empty.  The only living things we saw were the chickens and pigs in the  kitchen-gardens.  On either hand was every evidence of hasty and  panic-stricken flight.  We rejoiced at these evidences of the fact that  the Wisconsin Volunteers had swept all before them.  Our rejoicings were  not entirely unselfish.  It was so quiet ahead that some one suggested  the town had already surrendered.  But that would have been too bitter a  disappointment, and as the firing from the further side of Coamo still  continued, we refused to believe it, and whipped the ponies into greater  haste.  We were now only a quarter of a mile distant from the built-up  portion of Coamo, where the road turned sharply into the main street of  the town.    Captain Paget, who in the absence of the British military attache on  account of sickness, accompanied the army as a guest of General Wilson,  gave way to thoughts of etiquette.    \"Will General Wilson think I should have waited for him?\" he shouted.  The words were jolted out of him as he rose in the saddle.  The noise of  the ponies' hoofs made conversation difficult.  I shouted back that the  presence of General Ernst in the town made it quite proper for a foreign  attache to enter it.    \"It must have surrendered by now,\" I shouted.  \"It's been half an hour  since Ernst crossed the bridge.\"    At these innocent words, all my companions tugged violently at their  bridles and shouted \"Whoa!\"    \"Crossed the bridge?\" they yelled.  \"There is no bridge!  The bridge is  blown up!  If he hasn't crossed by the ford, he isn't in the town!\"    Then, in my turn, I shouted \"Whoa!\"    But by now the Porto Rican ponies had decided that this was the race of  their lives, and each had made up his mind that, Mexican bit or no  Mexican bit, until he had carried his rider first into the town of Coamo,  he would not be halted.  As I tugged helplessly at my Mexican bit, I saw  how I had made my mistake.  The volunteers, on finding the bridge  destroyed, instead of marching upon Coamo had turned to the ford, the  same ford which we had crossed half an hour before they reached it.  They  now were behind us.  Instead of a town which had surrendered to a  thousand American soldiers, we, seven unarmed men and Jimmy, were being  swept into a hostile city as fast as the enemy's ponies could take us  there.    Breckenridge and Titus hastily put the blame upon me.    \"If we get into trouble with the General for this,\" they shouted, \"it  will be your fault.  You told us Ernst was in the town with a thousand  men.\"    I shouted back that no one regretted the fact that he was not more keenly  than I did myself.    Titus and Breckenridge each glanced at a new, full-dress sword.    \"We might as well go in,\" they shouted, \"and take it anyway!\"  I decided  that Titus and Breckenridge were wasted in the Commissariat Department.    The three correspondents looked more comfortable.    \"If you officers go in,\" they cried, \"the General can't blame us,\" and  they dug their spurs into the ponies.    \"Wait!\" shouted Her Majesty's representative.  \"That's all very well for  you chaps, but what protects me if the Admiralty finds out I have led a  charge on a Spanish garrison?\"    But Paget's pony refused to consider the feelings of the Lords of the  Admiralty.  As successfully Paget might have tried to pull back a  row-boat from the edge of Niagara.  And, moreover, Millard, in order that  Jimmy might be the first to reach Ponce with despatches, had mounted him  on the fastest pony in the bunch, and he already was far in the lead.  His sporting instincts, nursed in the pool-rooms of the Tenderloin and at  Guttenburg, had sent him three lengths to the good.  It never would do to  have a newsboy tell in New York that he had beaten the correspondents of  the papers he sold in the streets; nor to permit commissioned officers to  take the dust of one who never before had ridden on anything but a cable  car.  So we all raced forward and, bunched together, swept into the main  street of Coamo.  It was gratefully empty.  There were no American  soldiers, but, then, neither were there any Spanish soldiers.  Across the  street stretched more rifle-pits and barricades of iron pipes, but in  sight there was neither friend nor foe.  On the stones of the deserted  street the galloping hoofs sounded like the advance of a whole regiment  of cavalry.  Their clatter gave us a most comfortable feeling.  We almost  could imagine the townspeople believing us to be the Rough Riders  themselves and fleeing before us.    And then, the empty street seemed to threaten an ambush.  We thought  hastily of sunken mines, of soldiers crouching behind the barriers,  behind the houses at the next corner, of Mausers covering us from the  latticed balconies overhead.  Until at last, when the silence had become  alert and menacing, a lonely man dashed into the middle of the street,  hurled a white flag in front of us, and then dived headlong under the  porch of a house.  The next instant, as though at a signal, a hundred  citizens, each with a white flag in both hands, ran from cover, waving  their banners, and gasping in weak and terror-shaken tones, \"Vivan los  Americanos.\"    We tried to pull up, but the ponies had not yet settled among themselves  which of us had won, and carried us to the extreme edge of the town,  where a precipice seemed to invite them to stop, and we fell off into the  arms of the Porto Ricans.  They brought us wine in tin cans, cigars,  borne in the aprons and mantillas of their women-folk, and demijohns of  native rum.  They were abject, trembling, tearful.  They made one  instantly forget that the moment before he had been extremely frightened.    One of them spoke to me the few words of Spanish with which I had an  acquaintance.  He told me he was the Alcalde, and that he begged to  surrender into my hands the town of Coamo.  I led him instantly to one  side.  I was afraid that if I did not take him up he would surrender to  Paget or to Jimmy.  I bade him conduct me to his official residence.  He  did so, and gave me the key to the _cartel_, a staff of office of gold  and ebony, and the flag of the town, which he had hidden behind his  writing-desk.  It was a fine Spanish flag with the coat of arms  embroidered in gold.  I decided that, with whatever else I might part,  that flag would always be mine, that the chance of my again receiving the  surrender of a town of five thousand people was slender, and that this  token would be wrapped around me in my coffin.  I accordingly hid it in  my poncho and strapped it to my saddle.  Then I appointed a hotel-keeper,  who spoke a little English, as my official interpreter, and told the  Alcalde that I was now Military Governor, Mayor, and Chief of Police, and  that I wanted the seals of the town.  He gave me a rubber stamp with a  coat of arms cut in it, and I wrote myself three letters, which, to  insure their safe arrival, I addressed to three different places, and  stamped them with the rubber seals.  In time all three reached me, and I  now have them as documentary proof of the fact that for twenty minutes I  was Military Governor and Mayor of Coamo.    During that brief administration I detailed Titus and Breckenridge to  wigwag the Sixteenth Pennsylvania that we had taken the town, and that it  was now safe for them to enter.  In order to compromise Paget they used  his red silk handkerchief.  Root I detailed to conciliate the inhabitants  by drinking with every one of them.  He tells me he carried out my  instructions to the letter.  I also settled one assault and battery case,  and put the chief offender under arrest.  At least, I told the official  interpreter to inform him that he was under arrest, but as I had no one  to guard him he grew tired of being under arrest and went off to  celebrate his emancipation from the rule of Spain.    My administration came to an end in twenty minutes, when General Wilson  rode into Coamo at the head of his staff and three thousand men.  He "]]]
