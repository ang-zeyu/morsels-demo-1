As the  son-in-law of a Southern planter in North Carolina, and as the father  of sons who inherited slave property, Douglas, although born in Vermont,  knew the South as did no other Northern statesman. He knew also the  institution of slavery at first hand. As a pronounced expansionist  and as the congressional leader in all matters pertaining to the  Territories, he acquired detailed information as to the qualities of  these new possessions, and he spoke, therefore, with a good degree of  authority when he said, \"If there was one inch of territory in the whole  of our acquisitions from Mexico where slavery could exist, it was in the  valleys of the Sacramento and the San Joaquin.\" But this region was at  once preempted for freedom upon the discovery of gold.    Douglas did not admit that even the whole of Texas would remain  dedicated to slavery. Some of the States to be formed from it would be  free, by the same laws of climate and resources which determined that  the entire West would remain free. Before the Mexican War the Senator  had become convinced that the extension of slavery had reached its  limit; that the Missouri Compromise was a dead letter except as a  psychological palliative; that Nature had already ordained that slave  labor should be forever excluded from all Western territory both north  and south of that line. His reply to Calhoun's contention that a balance  must be maintained between slave and free States was that he had plans  for forming seventeen new States out of the vast Western domains, every  one of which would be free. And besides, said he, \"we all look forward  with confidence to the time when Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky,  and Missouri, and probably North Carolina and Tennessee will adopt a  gradual system of emancipation.\" Douglas was one of the first to favor  the admission of California as a free State. According to the Missouri  Compromise law and the laws of Mexico, all Western territory was  free, and he was opposed to interference with existing conditions. The  Missouri Compromise was still held sacred. Finally, however, it was with  Douglas's assistance that the Compromise measures of 1850 were passed,  one of which provided for territorial Governments for Utah and New  Mexico with the proviso that, when admitted as States, slavery should be  permitted or prohibited as the citizens of those States should determine  at the time. Congress refrained from any declaration as to slavery in  the Territories. It was this policy of \"non-intervention\" which four  years later furnished plausible excuse for the repeal of the Missouri  Compromise.    It was not strange that there was general ignorance in all parts of the  country as to the resources of the newly acquired territory. The rush  to the goldfields precipitated action in respect to California. Before  General Taylor, the newly elected President, was inaugurated, there  was imminent need of an efficient government. An early act of the  Administration was to send an agent to assist in the formation of a  state Government, and a convention was immediately called to frame a  constitution. By unanimous vote of the convention, slavery was excluded.  The constitution was approved by popular vote and was presented to  Congress for final acceptance in December, 1849.    In the meantime a great commotion had arisen among the people. Southern  state legislatures passed resolutions demanding that the rights of their  peculiar institution should be recognized in the new Territory. Northern  legislatures responded with resolutions favoring the admission of  California as a State and the application of the Wilmot Proviso to the  remaining territory. Northern Democrats had very generally denied that  the affair with Mexico had as a chief purpose the extension of slavery.  Democrats therefore united with Whigs in maintaining the principle of  free soil. In the South there was a corresponding fusion of the two  parties in support of the sectional issue.    General concern prevailed as to the attitude of the Administration.  Taylor's election had been effected by both a Southern and a Northern  split in the Democratic party. Northern Democrats had voted for the  Free-soil candidate because of the alleged pro-slavery tendencies of  their own party. Southern Democrats voted for Taylor because of their  distrust of Lewis Cass, their own candidate. Some of these met in  convention and formally nominated Taylor, and Taylor accepted their  nomination with thanks. Northern anti-slavery Whigs had a difficult task  to keep their members in line. There is evidence that Taylor held the  traditional Southern view that the anti-slavery North was disposed  to encroach upon the rights of the South. Meeting fewer Northern  Whig supporters, he became convinced that the more active spirit of  encroachment was in the pro-slavery South. California needed a state  Government, and the President took the most direct method to supply  that need. As the inhabitants were unanimous in their desire to exclude  slavery, their wish should be respected. New Mexico was in a similar  situation. As slavery was already excluded from the territory under  Mexican law, and as there was no wish on the part of the inhabitants to  introduce slavery, the President recognized existing facts and made  no change. When Southern leaders projected a scheme to enlarge the  boundaries of Texas so as to extend slavery over a large part of New  Mexico, President Taylor set a guard of United States troops to maintain  the integrity of the Territory. When a deputation of Southern Whigs  endeavored to dissuade him from his purpose, threatening a dissolution  of the Union and intimating that army officers would refuse to act  against citizens of Texas, the soldier President replied that in such an  event he would take command in person and would hang any one caught in  acts of treason. When Henry Clay introduced an elaborate project for a  compromise between the North and the South, the President insisted  that each question should be settled on its own merits and directed the  forces of the Administration against any sort of compromise. The debate  over Clay's Omnibus Bill was long and acrimonious. On July 4, 1850,  the President seemed triumphant. But upon that day, notwithstanding his  apparent robust health, he was stricken down with an acute disease and  died five days later. With his passing, the opposing Whig faction came  into power. The so-called compromise measures were at length one by one  passed by Congress and approved by President Fillmore.    California was admitted as a free State; but as a palliative to the  South, Congress passed bills for the organization of territorial  Governments for New Mexico and Utah without positive declarations  regarding the powers of the territorial Legislatures over slavery. All  questions relating to title to slaves were to be left to the courts.  Meantime it was left in doubt whether Mexican law excluding slavery was  still in force. Southern malcontents maintained that this act was a  mere hoax, using words which suggested concession when no concession was  intended. Northern anti-slavery men criticized the act as the entering  wedge for another great surrender to the enemy. Because of the  uncertainty regarding the meaning of the law and the false hopes likely  to be created, they maintained that it was fitted to foment discord and  prolong the period of distrust between the two sections. At all events  such was its actual effect.    A third act in this unhappy series gave to Texas ten millions of dollars  for the alleged surrender of claims to a part of New Mexico. This had  little bearing on the general subject of compromise; yet anti-slavery  men criticized it on the ground that the issue raised was insincere;  that the appropriation was in fact a bribe to secure votes necessary to  pass the other measures; that the bill was passed through Congress  by shameless bribery, and that even the boundaries conceded to Texas  involved the surrender of free territory.    The abolition of the slave-trade in the District of Columbia was  supported by both sections of the country. The removal of the slave  pens within sight of the Capitol to a neighboring city deprived the  abolitionists of one of their weapons for effective agitation, but it  did not otherwise affect the position of slavery.    Of the five acts included in the compromise measures, the one which  provided for the return of fugitive slaves was most effective in the  promotion of hostility between the two sections. During the six months  of debate on the Omnibus Bill, numerous bills were presented to take the  place of the law of 1793. Webster brought forward a bill which provided  for the use of a jury to establish the validity of a claim to an escaped  slave. But that which was finally adopted by a worn-out Congress is  characterized as one of the most barbarous pieces of legislation ever  enacted by a civilized country. A single incident may indicate the  nature of the act. James Hamlet, for three years a resident of New York  City, a husband and a father and a member of the Methodist Church, was  seized eight days after the law went into effect by order of the agent  of Mary Brown of Baltimore, cut off from all communication with his  friends, hurried before a commissioner, and on ex parte testimony was  delivered into the hands of the agent, by whom he was handcuffed and  secretly conveyed to Baltimore. Mr. Rhodes accounts for the enactment  in the following words: \"If we look below the surface we shall find a  strong impelling motive of the Southern clamor for this harsh enactment  other than the natural desire to recover lost property.

Gibbon, when speaking of his own genealogy, refers to the fact of  Fielding being of the same family as the Earl of Denbigh, who, in common  with the Imperial family of Austria, is descended from the celebrated  Rodolph, of Hapsburgh. \"While the one branch,\" he says, \"have contented  themselves with being sheriffs of Leicestershire, and justices of the  peace, the others have been emperors of Germany and kings of Spain; but  the magnificent romance of _Tom Jones_ will be read with pleasure, when  the palace of the Escurial is in ruins, and the Imperial Eagle of  Austria is rolling in the dust.\"           *       *       *       *       *      FIELDING'S \"TOM JONES.\"    Fielding having finished the manuscript of _Tom Jones_, and being at the  time hard pressed for money took it to a second-rate publisher, with the  view of selling it for what it would fetch at the moment. He left it  with the trader, and called upon him next day for his decision. The  bookseller hesitated, and requested another day for consideration; and  at parting, Fielding offered him the MS. for 25_l._    On his way home, Fielding met Thomson, the poet, whom he told of the  negotiation for the sale of the MS.; when Thomson, knowing the high  merit of the work, conjured him to be off the bargain, and offered to  find a better purchaser.    Next morning, Fielding hastened to his appointment, with as much  apprehension lest the bookseller should stick to his bargain as he  had felt the day before lest he should altogether decline it. To the  author's great joy, the ignorant trafficker in literature declined, and  returned the MS. to Fielding. He next set off, with a light heart, to  his friend Thomson; and the novelist and the poet then went to Andrew  Millar, the great publisher of the day. Millar, as was his practice with  works of light reading, handed the MS. to his wife, who, having read it,  advised him by no means to let it slip through his fingers.    Millar now invited the two friends to meet him at a coffee-house in the  Strand, where, after dinner, the bookseller, with great caution, offered  Fielding 200_l._ for the MS. The novelist was amazed at the largeness  of the offer. \"Then, my good sir,\" said Fielding, recovering himself  from his unexpected stroke of good fortune, \"give me your hand--the book  is yours. And, waiter,\" continued he, \"bring a couple of bottles of your  best port.\"    Before Millar died, he had cleared eighteen thousand pounds by _Tom  Jones_, out of which he generously made Fielding various presents, to  the amount of 2000_l._; and he closed his life by bequeathing a handsome  legacy to each of Fielding's sons.           *       *       *       *       *      VOLTAIRE AND FERNEY.    The showman's work is very profitable at the country-house of Voltaire,  at Ferney, near Geneva. A Genevese, an excellent calculator, as are all  his countrymen, many years ago valued as follows the yearly profit  derived by the above functionary from his situation:--                                                             Francs.   8000 busts of Voltaire, made with earth of      Ferney, at a franc a-piece                            8,000   1200 autograph letters, at 20 francs                    24,000   500 walking canes of Voltaire, at 50 francs each        25,000   300 veritable wigs of Voltaire, at 100 francs           30,000                                                           ------                                           In all          87,000           *       *       *       *       *      CLEAN HANDS.    Lord Brougham, during his indefatigable canvass of Yorkshire, in the  course of which he often addressed ten or a dozen meetings in a day,  thought fit to harangue the electors of Leeds immediately on his  arrival, after travelling all night, and without waiting to perform his  customary ablutions. \"These hands are clean!\" cried he, at the  conclusion of a diatribe against corruption; but they happened to be  very dirty, and this practical contradiction raised a hearty laugh.           *       *       *       *       *      MODERATE FLATTERY.    Jasper Mayne says of Master Cartwright, the author of tolerable comedies  and poems, printed in 1651:--     \"Yes, thou to Nature hadst joined art and skill;    In thee, Ben Jonson still held Shakspeare's quill.\"           *       *       *       *       *      EVERY-DAY LIFE OF JAMES SMITH.    \"One of the Authors of the _Rejected Addresses_\" thus writes to a  friend:[3]--    \"Let me enlighten you as to the general disposal of my time. I breakfast  at nine, with a mind undisturbed by matters of business; I then write to  you, or to some editor, and then read till three o'clock. I then walk to  the Union Club, read the journals, hear Lord John Russell deified or  _diablerized_, (that word is not a bad coinage,) do the same with  Sir Robert Peel or the Duke of Wellington; and then join a knot of  conversationists by the fire till six o'clock, consisting of lawyers,  merchants, members of Parliament, and gentlemen at large. We then and  there discuss the three per cent. consols, (some of us preferring Dutch  two-and-a-half per cent.), and speculate upon the probable rise, shape,  and cost of the New Exchange. If Lady Harrington happen to drive past  our window in her landau, we compare her equipage to the Algerine  Ambassador's; and when politics happen to be discussed, rally Whigs,  Radicals, and Conservatives alternately, but never seriously,--such  subjects having a tendency to create acrimony. At six, the room begins  to be deserted; wherefore I adjourn to the dining-room, and gravely  looking over the bill of fare, exclaim to the waiter, 'Haunch of mutton  and apple tart.' These viands despatched, with the accompanying liquids  and water, I mount upward to the library, take a book and my seat in  the arm-chair, and read till nine. Then call for a cup of coffee and a  biscuit, resuming my book till eleven; afterwards return home to bed. If  I have any book here which particularly excites my attention, I place my  lamp on a table by my bed-side, and read in bed until twelve. No danger  of ignition, my lamp being quite safe, and my curtains moreen. Thus  'ends this strange eventful history,'\" &c.

The celebrated Mrs. Thicknesse undertook to construct a letter, every  word of which should be French, yet no Frenchman should be able to read  it; while an illiterate Englishman or Englishwoman should decipher it  with ease. Here is the specimen of the lady's ingenuity:--    \"Pre, dire sistre, comme and se us, and pass the de here if yeux canne,  and chat tu my dame, and dine here; and yeux mai go to the faire if yeux  plaise; yeux mai have fiche, muttin, porc, buter, foule, hair, fruit,  pigeon, olives, sallette, forure diner, and excellent te, cafe, port  vin, an liqueurs; and tell ure bette and poll to comme; and Ile go tu  the faire and visite the Baron.

Flatman's beautiful lines to Walton, (says Mr. Jesse) commencing--     \"Happy old man, whose worth all mankind knows    Except himself,\"    have always struck us as conveying a true picture of Walton's character,  and of the estimation in which he was held after the appearance of his  \"Angler.\"    The last male descendant of our \"honest father,\" the Rev. Dr. Herbert  Hawes, died in 1839. He very liberally bequeathed the beautiful painting  of Walton, by Houseman, to the National Gallery; and it is a curious  fact, as showing the estimation in which anything connected with Walton  is held in the present day, that the lord of the manor in which Dr.  Hawes resided, laid claim to this portrait as a heriot, though not  successfully. Dr. Hawes also bequeathed the greater portion of his  library to the Dean and Chapter of Salisbury; and his executor and  friend presented the celebrated prayer-book, which was Walton's, to  Mr. Pickering, the publisher. The watch which belonged to Walton's  connexion, the excellent Bishop Ken, has been presented to his amiable  biographer, the Rev. W. Lisle Bowles.    Walton died at the house of his son-in-law, Dr. Hawkins, at Winchester.  He was buried in Winchester Cathedral, in the south aisle, called Prior  Silkstead's Chapel. A large black marble slab is placed over his remains;  and, to use the poetical language of Mr. Bowles, \"the morning sunshine  falls directly on it, reminding the contemplative man of the mornings  when he was, for so many years, up and abroad with his angle, on the  banks of the neighbouring stream.\"           *       *       *       *       *      PRAISE OF ALE.    Dr. Still, though Bishop of Bath and Wells, seems not to have been over  fond of water; for thus he sings:--     \"A stoup of ale, then, cannot fail,      To cheer both heart and soul;    It hath a charm, and without harm      Can make a lame man whole.
