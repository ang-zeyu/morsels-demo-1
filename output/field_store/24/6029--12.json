If a stranger queen appears, she is instantly seized by the  bees on guard, which prevent her entry by laying hold of her legs or  wings with their teeth, and crowd so closely around her, that she cannot  move. Other bees, from the interior of the hive, gradually come to their  assistance, and confine her still more narrowly, all having their heads  towards the centre where the queen is inclosed; and they remain with  such evident anxiety, eagerness, and attention, that the cluster they  form may be carried about for some time, without their being sensible  of it. A stranger queen, so closely confined and hemmed in, cannot  possibly penetrate the hive. If the bees retain her too long imprisoned,  she perishes. Her death probably ensues from hunger, or the privation of  air; it is undoubted, at least, that she is never stung. We never saw  the bees direct their stings against her, except a single time, and then  it was owing to ourselves. We endeavoured, from compassion for a queen's  situation, to remove her from the center of a cluster; the bees became  enraged; and, in darting out their stings, some struck the queen, and  killed her. It is so certain that the stings were not purposely directed  against her, that several of the workers were themselves killed; and  surely they could not intend destroying one another. Had we not  interfered, they would have been content with confining the queen, and  would not have massacred her.    It was in similar circumstances that M. Riems saw the workers anxiously  pursue a queen. He thought they designed to sting her, and thence  concluded, that the office of the common bees is to kill supernumerary  queens. You have quoted his observations in the _Contemplation de la  Nature, part II, chap. 27, note 7_. But you are sensible, Sir, from  these details, that he has been mistaken. He did not know the attention  that bees bestow on what passes at the entrance of their hive, and he  was entirely ignorant of the means they take to prevent supernumerary  queens from penetrating it.           *       *       *       *       *    After ascertaining that the workers in no situation sting the  supernumerary queens, we were curious to learn how a stranger queen  would be received in a hive wanting a reigning one. To elucidate this  matter, we made numerous experiments, the detail of which would protract  this letter too much, therefore I shall relate only the principal  results.    Bees do not immediately observe the removal of their queen; their  labours are uninterrupted; they watch over the young, and perform all  their ordinary occupations. But, in a few hours, agitation ensues; all  appears a scene of tumult in the hive. A singular humming is heard; the  bees desert their young; and rush over the surface of the combs with a  delirious impetuosity. Then they discover their queen is no longer among  them. But how do they become sensible of it? How do the bees on the  surface of the comb discover that the queen is not on the next comb? In  treating of another characteristic of these animals, you have yourself,  Sir, proposed the same question; I am incapable of answering it indeed,  but I have collected some facts, that may perhaps facilitate the  elucidation of this mystery.    I cannot doubt that the agitation arises from the workers having lost  their queen; for on restoring her, tranquillity is instantly regained  among them; and, what is very singular, they _recognise_ her: you must  interpret this expression strictly. Substitution of another queen is not  attended with the same effect, if she is introduced into the hive within  the first twelve hours after removal of the reigning one. Here the  agitation continues; and the bees treat the stranger the same as when  the presence of their own leaves them nothing to desire. They surround,  seize, and keep her captive, a very long time, in an impenetrable  cluster; and she commonly dies either from hunger or privation of air.    If eighteen hours elapse before substitution of a stranger queen for the  native one removed, she is at first treated in the same manner, but the  bees leave her sooner; nor is the surrounding cluster so close; they  gradually disperse; and the queen is at last liberated. She moves  languidly; and sometimes expires in a few minutes. However some queens  have escaped in good health from an imprisonment of seventeen hours; and  ended with reigning in the hives where they had originally been ill  received.    If, before substituting the stranger queen, twenty-four hours elapse,  she will be well received, and reign from the moment of her introduction  into the hive. Here I speak of the good reception given to a queen after  an interregnum of twenty-four hours. But as this word reception is very  indefinite, it is proper to enter into some detail for explaining the  exact sense in which I use it. On the 15. of August, I introduced a  fertile queen, eleven months old, into a glass hive. The bees were  twenty-four hours deprived of their queen, and had already begun the  construction of twelve royal-cells, such as described in the preceding  chapter. Immediately on placing this female stranger on the comb, the  workers near her touched her with their antennae, and, passing their  trunks over every part of her body, they gave her honey. Then these gave  place to others that treated her exactly in the same manner. All  vibrated their wings at once, and ranged themselves in a circle around  their sovereign. Hence resulted a kind of agitation which gradually  communicated to the workers situated on the same surface of the comb,  and induced them to come and reconnoitre, in their turn, what was going  on. They soon arrived; and, having broke through the circle formed by  the first, approached the queen, touched her with the antennae, and gave  her honey. After this little ceremony they retired; and, placing  themselves behind the others, enlarged the circle. There they vibrated  their wings, and buzzed without tumult or disorder, and as if  experiencing some very agreeable sensation. The queen had not yet moved  from the place where I had put her, but in a quarter of an hour she  began to move. The bees, far from opposing her, opened the circle at  that part to which she turned, followed her, and formed a guard around.  She was oppressed with the necessity of laying, and dropped eggs.  Finally, after four hours abode, she began to deposit male eggs in the  cells she met.    While these events passed on the surface of the comb where the queen  stood, all was quiet on the other side. Here the workers were apparently  ignorant of a queen's arrival in the hive. They laboured with great  activity at the royal cells, as if ignorant that they no longer stood in  need of them: they watched over the royal worms, supplied them with  jelly and the like. But the queen having at length come to this side,  she was received with the same respect that she had experienced from  their companions on the other side of the comb. They encompassed her;  gave her honey; and touched her with their antennae: and what proved  better that they treated her as a mother, was their immediately  desisting from work at the royal cells; they removed the worms, and  devoured the food collected around them. From this moment the queen was  recognised by all her people, and conducted herself in this new  habitation as if it had been her native hive.    These particulars will give a just idea of the manner that bees receive  a stranger queen; when they have time to forget their own, she is  treated exactly as if she was their natural one, except that there is  perhaps at first greater interest testified in her, or more conspicuous  demonstrations of it. I am sensible of the impropriety of these  expressions, but M. de Reaumur in some respect authorises them. He does  not scruple to say, that bees pay _attention_, _homage_, and _respect_,  to their queen, and from his example the like expressions have escaped  most authors that treat on bees.    Twenty-four or thirty hours absence is sufficient to make them forget  their first queen, but I can hazard no conjecture on the cause.           *       *       *       *       *    Before terminating this letter, which is full of combats and disastrous  scenes, I should, perhaps, give you an account of some more pleasing  and interesting facts relative to their industry. However, to avoid  returning to duels and massacres, I shall here subjoin my observations  on the massacre of the males.    You will remember, Sir, it is agreed by all observers, that at a certain  period of the year, the workers kill and expel the drones. M. de Reaumur  speaks of these executions as a horrible massacre. He does not expressly  affirm, indeed, that he has himself witnessed it, but what we have seen  corresponds so well with his account, that there can be no doubt he has  beheld the peculiarities of the massacre.    It is usually in the months of July and August, that the bees free  themselves of the males. Then they are drove away and pursued to the  inmost parts of the hive, where they collect in numbers; and as at the  same time we find many dead drones on the ground before the hives, it is  indubitable that after being expelled, the bees sting them to death.  Yet on the surface of the comb, we do not see the sting used against  them; there the bees are content to pursue and drive them away. You  observe this, Sir, yourself, in the new notes added to _la Contemplation  de la Nature_; and you seem disposed to think, that the drones forced to  retire to the extremity of the hive, perish from hunger. Your conjecture  was extremely probable. Still it was possible the carnage might take  place in the bottom of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26477"],[0,"Observations on the Florid Song; Or, Sentiments on the Ancient and Modern (#13)"],[1,"all, the Hindrance of Study.    Sec. 13.[93] The golden Age of Musick would be already at an End, if the  Swans did not make their Nests on some Theatres in _Italy_, or on the  royal Banks of the _Thames_. O dear _London_!----On the other Streams,  they sing no more as they used to do their sweet Notes at their  expiring; but rather sadly lament the Expiration of those august and  adorable Princes, by whom they were tenderly belov'd and esteemed. This  is the usual Vicissitude of Things in this World; and we daily see, that  whatever is sublunary must of Necessity decline. Let us leave the Tears  to the Heart, and return to the Singer.    Sec. 14. A discreet Person will never use such affected Expressions as, _I  cannot sing To-day;--I've got a deadly Cold;_ and, in making his Excuse,  falls a Coughing. I can truly say, that I have never in my Life heard a  Singer own the Truth, and say, _I'm very well to-day_: They reserve the  unseasonable Confession to the next Day, when they make no Difficulty to  say, _In all my Days my Voice was never in better Order than it was  Yesterday_. I own, on certain Conjunctures, the Pretext is not only  suitable, but even necessary; for, to speak the Truth, the indiscreet  Parsimony of some, who would hear Musick for Thanks only, goes so far,  that they think a Master is immediately obliged to obey them _gratis_,  and that the Refusal is an Offence that deserves Resentment and Revenge.  But if it is a Law human and divine, that every Body should live by  their honest Labour, what barbarous Custom obliges a Musician to serve  without a Recompence? A cursed Over-bearing; O sordid Avarice!    Sec. 15. A Singer, that knows the World, distinguishes between the  different Manners of Commanding; he knows how to refuse without  disobliging, and how to obey with a good Grace; not being ignorant, that  one, who has his Interest most at Heart, sometimes finds his Account in  serving without a Gratification.    Sec. 16. One who sings with a Desire of gaining Honour and Credit, cannot  sing ill, and in time will sing better; and one, who thinks on nothing  but Gain, is in the ready way to remain ignorant.    Sec. 17. Who would ever think (if Experience did not shew it) that a Virtue  of the highest Estimation should prejudice a Singer? And yet, whilst  Presumption and Arrogance triumph (I'm shock'd to think on't) amiable  Humility, the more the Singer has of it, the more it depresses him.    Sec. 18. At first Sight, Arrogance has the Appearance of Ability; but,  upon a nearer View, I can discover Ignorance in Masquerade.    Sec. 19. This Arrogance serves them sometimes, as a politick Artifice to  hide their own Failings: For Example, certain Singers would not be  unconcern'd, under the Shame of not being able to sing a few Barrs at  Sight, if with Shrugs, scornful Glances, and malicious shaking of their  Heads, they did not give the Auditors to understand that those gross  Errors are owing to him that accompanies, or to the _Orchestre_.    Sec. 20. To humble such Arrogance, may it never meet with that Incense  which it expects.    Sec. 21. Who could sing better than the Arogant, if they were not ashamed  to study?    Sec. 22. It is a Folly in a Singer to grow vain at the first Applauses,  without reflecting whether they are given by Chance, or out of Flattery;  and if he thinks he deserves them, there is an End of him.    Sec. 23. He should regulate his Voice according to the Place where he  sings; for it would be the greatest Absurdity, not to make a Difference  between a small Cabinet and a vast Theatre.[94]    Sec. 24. He is still more to be blam'd, who, when singing in two, three, or  four Parts, does so raise his Voice as to drown his Companions; for if  it is not Ignorance, it is something worse.    Sec. 25. All Compositions for more than one Voice ought to be sung strictly  as they are written; nor do they require any other Art but a noble  Simplicity. I remember to have heard once a famous _Duetto_ torn into  Atoms by two renown'd Singers, in Emulation; the one proposing, and the  other by Turns answering, that at last it[95] ended in a Contest, who  could produce the most Extravagancies.    Sec. 26. The Correction of Friends, that have Knowledge, instructs very  much; but still greater Advantage may be gain'd from the ill-natur'd  Criticks; for, the more intent they are to discover Defects, the greater  Benefit may be receiv'd from them without any Obligation.    Sec. 27. It is certain, that the Errors corrected by our Enemies are better  cur'd, than those corrected by ourselves; for we are apt to indulge our  Faults, nor can we so easily perceive them.    Sec. 28. He that sings with Applause in one Place only, let him not have  too good an Opinion of himself; let him often change Climates, and then  he will judge better of his Talent.    Sec. 29. To please universally, Reason will tell you, that you must always  sing well; but if Reason does not inform you, Interest will persuade you  to conform to the Taste of that Nation (provided it be not too deprav'd)  which pays you.    Sec. 30. If he that sings well provokes Envy, by singing better he will get  the Victory over it.    Sec. 31. I do not know if a perfect Singer can at the same time be a  perfect Actor; for the Mind being at once divided by two different  Operations, he will probably incline more to one than the other; It  being, however, much more difficult to sing well than to act well, the  Merit of the first is beyond the second. What a Felicity would it be, to  possess both in a perfect Degree![96]    Sec. 32. Having said, a Singer should not copy, I repeat it now with this  Reason; that to copy is the part of a Scholar, that of a Master is to  invent.    Sec. 33. Let it be remembered by the Singer, that copying comes from  Laziness, and that none copy ill but out of Ignorance.    Sec. 34. Where Knowledge with Study makes one a good Singer, Ignorance with  one single Copy makes a thousand bad ones; however, among these there  are none that will acknowledge her for a Teacher.    Sec. 35. If many of the female Singers (for whom I have due Respect) would  be pleased to consider, that by copying a good one, they are become very  bad ones, they would not appear so ridiculous on the Stage for their  Affectation in presuming to sing the _Airs_ of the Person they copy,  with the same Graces. In this great Error, (if it does not proceed from  their Masters) they seem to be governed by Instinct, like the inferior  Creatures, rather than by Reason; for That would shew them, that we may  arrive at Applause by different ways, and past Examples, as well as one  at this present make us sensible, that two Women would not be equally  eminent if the one copy'd the other.[97]    Sec. 36. If the Complaisance, which is due to the fair Sex, does not excuse  the Abuse of copying when it proves prejudicial to the Profession, what  ought one then to say of those Men, who, instead of inventing, not only  copy others of their own Sex, but also Women. Foolish and  shameful!----Supposing an Impossibility, _viz._ that a Singer has  arrived at copying in such a Manner as not to be distinguished from the  Original, should he attribute to himself a Merit which does not belong  to him, and dress himself out in the Habits of another without being  afraid of being stripp'd of them?    Sec. 37. He, that rightly knows how to copy in Musick, takes nothing but  the Design; because that Ornament, which we admire when _natural_,  immediately loses its Beauty when _artificial_.    Sec.38. The most admired Graces of a Professor ought only to be imitated,  and not copied; on Condition also, that it does not bear not even so  much as a Shadow of Resemblance of the Original; otherwise, instead of a  beautiful Imitation, it will become a despicable Copy.    Sec. 39. I cannot decide, which of the two deserves most to be despised,  one who cannot imitate a good Singer without _Caricatura's_, or He that  cannot imitate any well but bad ones.    Sec. 40. If many Singers knew, that a bad Imitation is a contagious Evil,  to which one who studies is not liable, the World would not be reduc'd  to the Misfortune of seeing in a _Carnaval_ but one Theatre provided  with eminent Performers, without Hopes of[98] an approaching Remedy.  Let them take it for their Pains. Let the World learn to applaud Merit;  and (not to use a more harsh Expression) be less complaisant to Faults.    Sec. 41. Whoever does not know how to steal the Time in Singing, knows not  how to Compose, nor to Accompany himself, and is destitute of the best  Taste and greatest Knowledge.[99]    Sec. 42. The stealing of Time, in the _Pathetick_, is an honourable Theft  in one that sings better than others, provided he makes a Restitution  with Ingenuity.    Sec. 43. An Exercise, no less necessary than this, is That of agreeably  _putting forth_ of the Voice, without which all Application is vain.  Whosoever pretends to obtain it, must hearken more to the Dictates of  the Heart, than to those of Art.    Sec. 44. Oh! how great a Master is the Heart! Confess it, my beloved  Singers, and gratefully own, that you would not have arrived at the  highest Rank of the Profession if you had not been its Scholars; own,  that in a few Lessons from it, you learned the most beautiful  Expressions, the most refin'd Taste, the most noble Action, and the most  exquisite Graces: Own, (though it be hardly credible) that the Heart  corrects the Defects of Nature, since it softens a Voice that's harsh,  betters an indifferent one, and perfects a good one: Own, when the Heart  sings you cannot dissemble, nor has Truth a greater Power of persuading:  And, lastly, do you convince the World, (what is not in my Power to do)  that from the Heart alone you have learn'd that _Je ne scai quoy_, that  pleasing Charm, that so subtily passes from Vein to Vein, and makes its  way to the very Soul.
