If the horse is at all frightened at  the candle, he can be blindfolded; but the operation is so quick, that  generally it is all over before he is aware of what is being done. The  long hairs on the muzzle and chin can be clipped off with a pair of  ordinary scissors. If the horse is not clipped all over, attention to  these one or two little details make all the difference in his appearance,  and in his being turned out smart, or the reverse.      Trimming Tails.    The tail should be grasped close to the root with one hand, which is run  down so that the hairs are all gathered together, and a string or tape  tied round below the fleshy part at the tip. The tail should then be drawn  out straight, and the hair cut off with a single sweep of a sharp knife  just below where the string is tied. The blade of the knife must be long  enough to give a drawing sweep, which an ordinary pocket-knife will not  do. There is nothing better for this than a sharp native sword, or  \"tulwar,\" as it is long enough to cut through all the hair at one stroke;  or, failing a sword, a sharp carving-knife will do, the longer in the  blade the better. Any uneven ends of hair that remain can afterwards be  trimmed off with a pair of scissors; or, better still, by a pair of sheep  shears. Tail-cutting machines are sold with an arrangement to fix the hair  of the tail with a clamp, on which there is a sliding cutting-blade. These  cut the hair off very smoothly and evenly; the only drawback is that they  are somewhat expensive, costing about Rs. 16 in Calcutta or Bombay.      Clipping.    Arabs and many country-breds carry such fine coats that they do not  require clipping, but most Australians and colonials do; and if the coat  is at all inclined to get long and thick, it certainly should be taken  off, for horse-clothing is so cheap that an extra rug can always be got.  Horses should not be clipped till the coat has \"set,\" _i.e._ till the long  winter coat has grown, and no more hairs will come off when the hand is  rubbed over the skin. This is generally about the beginning of October in  Northern India. They will generally require clipping twice or three times  during the winter, or up to the middle of March. There are generally some  professional clippers in every station, who bring their own  clipping-machines, and charge about two or three rupees for a pony, and an  extra rupee for a horse each time; or, if there is not such an individual  about, permission can generally be obtained to have it done by any of the  cavalry regiments in the station. It should be remembered that horses  having just lost their coats will require an extra rug that night.      Cleaning the Sheath.    The owner must himself occasionally see that the horse's sheath is washed  out. \"Syces\" never think this necessary, and the part gets into a filthy,  dirty state, that in the summer months is likely to give rise to a  troublesome sore, called a \"bursattee\" ulcer. Some horses are very  troublesome to do this with, and it may be necessary to put on a twitch  (\"kinch mhal\"); but this should always be done in the owner's presence.      Light in Stables.    With a new-comer, \"syces\" usually ask for oil to burn in a native  earthenware lamp (charragh) at night, but it is a thing I never allow. In  the first place, even if the lamp was kept burning, it is not required;  horses rest better in the dark. In the second, it is dangerous with so  much inflammable material about. In the third, the lamp will not be used  in the stable, but the \"syce's\" own house. If a light is ever required,  which is only on rare occasions, it is better to bring a lantern out of  the house; and in India there is always a hurricane-lantern to be found in  every house.      Fires in Verandahs.    \"Syces\" are very fond of lighting fires and making cooking places in the  verandah of the stable, but this I never allow, as it litters the place up  with cooking pots, and makes a great mess; also, it is dangerous. I always  make them carry on their cooking operations in the verandahs of their own  houses.          SADDLERY, HARNESS, CARRIAGES, AND SERVANTS.      Saddles (_zin_) and Harness (_saz_).    Saddles, harness, and all leatherwork requires a good deal more care and  attention in India than in England, especially during the hot season, when  the fierce dry heat will dry up and perish all sorts of leather; and in  the rains, especially in Southern India, where the atmosphere is so loaded  with moisture that leather, put on one side and neglected for a very few  days, soon becomes covered with mildew. There are no saddle rooms in  Indian stables, and it is usual to keep them in a corner of a room in the  house on a wooden saddle-stand, called by natives a \"ghorra\" horse. In the  rains, a pan or brazier of burning charcoal should be kept in the room for  a few hours daily, if there is not a fire-place. Saddles are cleaned in  the same way as in England, and excellent saddle soap and dubbing is made  by the North-west Province Soap Works at Meerut, and can be obtained  almost anywhere. If this is not used, the \"syces\" can always make up  dubbing of their own, called \"momrogan.\" Some people give their head  \"syce\" a monthly allowance to provide dubbing, soap, bathbrick, oil, etc.;  but as they frequently put lime and bleaching materials with it, I prefer  to buy it myself, and let them get the other articles. They require a  chamoise leather and a burnisher for steel-work, but one of each will do  for a stable of half a dozen horses, and very good country-made leathers  (sabur) can be got for from one to one and a half rupees. The soap is put  on to and rubbed into leather-work with the hands; but the great fault  they have is that they will put on too much, and won't work it in enough,  and one's breeches and hands will get into a great mess.      Saddle Covers (_buk bund_).    A sheet, made out of a description of coarse country cloth (karwah), is  necessary for each saddle or set of harness, to wrap it up in, and keep  the dust and dirt off. It should be sufficiently large to wrap the saddle  up in completely, and in the summer the \"syce\" can bring it with him to  act as a horse-cloth to throw over the quarters when standing about.  These saddle-sheets can be made by any tailor in a few hours.      Bridles.    Bridles, double (dahna), snaffle (kazai), can be hung up on the walls, but  a piece of cloth or a few sheets of paper should be fastened up behind  them; and they should be frequently taken down if not in daily use, as the  white ants are most destructive. It is best to have one or two extra  saddle-stands made with pegs on them, and to hang the bridles on them in  the middle of the room, away from the walls. This may be a little more  expensive, but a saddle-stand can be brought for Rs. 5 that will hold a  couple of dozen bridles, worth Rs. 20 apiece. At one time plated bits were  used in India, but I think steel ones are the best. \"Syces\" never can tell  the difference, and I have more than once found a plated bit being  industriously scrubbed and polished with sand.      Harness.    Unless particularly desired, brown harness with brass mounts is the  best--for India, at all events--for pony-harness, and it is this class of  animal that is generally used in an up-country station. Not one \"syce\" in  a hundred knows how to clean black harness properly, and if this is not  done nothing looks worse, whereas almost any native can clean brown  leather after a fashion, and even if it does not stand close inspection,  it will pass muster at a little distance. Fairly good brown harness is  made out of country leather, and it does well enough for rough work, but  it never has the finish of English. Country leather reins and country bits  should never be used; they are not reliable, and are most dangerous; these  should always be English.      Carriages.    The ordinary two-wheeled pony-trap or dogcart, used in an up-country  Indian station, is best varnished, not painted. The hot weather ruins  paint, and, unless in some of the very large towns, it is nearly  impossible to get them properly repainted again. Any native workman can,  however, varnish a trap with white or copal varnish. Before allowing new  varnish to be put on, the trap should be produced for inspection with the  old scraped off, as it is a favourite trick to daub new varnish over the  old, when it cannot properly set, and the first hot sun cracks and  blisters it. In the hot weather a large earthen basin, called a \"naund,\"  should be kept full of water under the carriage in the coach-house; the  evaporation of the water will keep the woodwork moist, and prevent its  cracking with the heat. A matting made of the fibres of the \"khus khus,\"  or lemon grass, should also be put round the nave of the wheel, and kept  wet, for the same purpose, as it is exceedingly likely to crack with the  heat. The shafts of the trap should not be left resting on the ground, as  they will warp and bend; they should be supported either by a wooden  trestle, or else by a couple of ropes from the beams of the roof. The  whip, when not in use, should be hung by a string at the upper part to a  nail in the wall, and a weight, such as a brick, tied to the butt end to  keep it straight; otherwise, in a very short time, it will get crooked.      Servants.    Indian \"syces\" are different to English grooms, as the new arrival will  soon find. They have peculiar customs of their own, which, like all  Orientals, they cling to tenaciously, and will not give up. If they are  understood they are easily managed, and work well; but if not, the  horse-owner's life is a burden to him, for no European can overcome the  passive resistance of the Oriental. In the first place, I never let any  of the house servants interfere with the stable. Many persons,  particularly those new to the country, do everything through their head  servant,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32426"],[0,"A Synopsis of the North American Lagomorpha (#13)"],[1,"outside).                               _Lepus californicus_ and _Lepus insularis_,                                                                 pp. 181, 186                            12'.
