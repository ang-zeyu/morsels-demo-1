If I did not accomplish these things, my ghost story would be  unworthy of its name. I thought and pondered--vainly. I felt that blank  incapability of invention which is the greatest misery of authorship,  when dull Nothing replies to our anxious invocations. _Have you thought  of a story?_ I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to  reply with a mortifying negative. Every thing must have a beginning, to  speak in Sanchean phrase; and that beginning must be linked to something  that went before. The Hindoos give the world an elephant to support it,  but they make the elephant stand upon a tortoise. Invention, it must be  humbly admitted, does not consist in creating out of void, but out of  chaos; the materials must, in the first place, be afforded: it can give  form to dark, shapeless substances, but cannot bring into being the  substance itself. In all matters of discovery and invention, even of  those that appertain to the imagination, we are continually reminded of  the story of Columbus and his egg. Invention consists in the capacity of  seizing on the capabilities of a subject, and in the power of moulding  and fashioning ideas suggested to it. Many and long were the  conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley, to which I was a devout  but nearly silent listener. During one of these, various philosophical  doctrines were discussed, and among others the nature of the principle  of life, and whether there was any probability of its ever being  discovered and communicated. They talked of the experiments of Dr.  Darwin (I speak not of what the Doctor really did, or said that he did,  but, as more to my purpose, of what was then spoken of as having been  done by him), who preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case, till  by some extraordinary means it began to move with voluntary motion. Not  thus, after all, would life be given. Perhaps a corpse would be  re-animated; galvanism had given token of such things: perhaps the  component parts of a creature might be manufactured, brought together,  and endued with vital warmth. Night waned upon this talk; and even the  witching hour had gone by, before we retired to rest. When I placed my  head upon my pillow, I did not sleep, nor could I be said to think. My  imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me, gifting the successive  images that arose in my mind with a vividness far beyond the usual  bounds of reverie. I saw--with shut eyes, but acute mental vision--I saw  the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put  together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then on  the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with  an uneasy, half vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely  frightful would be the effect of any human endeavor to mock the  stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world. His success would  terrify the artist; he would rush away from his odious handywork,  horror-stricken. He would hope that, left to itself, the slight spark of  life which he had communicated would fade; that this thing, which had  received such imperfect animation, would subside into dead matter; and  he might sleep in the belief that the silence of the grave would quench  for ever the transient existence of the hideous corpse which he had  looked upon as the cradle of life. He sleeps; but he is awakened; he  opens his eyes; behold the horrid thing stands at his bedside, opening  his curtains, and looking on him with yellow, watery, but speculative  eyes.    \"I opened mine in terror. The idea so possessed my mind, that a thrill  of fear ran through me, and I wished to exchange the ghastly image of my  fancy for the realities around. I see them still; the very room, the  dark _parquet_, the closed shutters, with the moonlight struggling  through, and the sense I had that the glassy lake and white high Alps  were beyond. I could not so easily get rid of my hideous phantom; still  it haunted me. I must try to think of something else. I recurred to my  ghost story,--my tiresome unlucky ghost story! O! if I could only  contrive one which would frighten my reader as I myself had been  frightened that night! Swift as light and as cheering was the idea that  broke in upon me. 'I found it! What terrified me will terrify others;  and I need only describe the spectre which had haunted my midnight  pillow.' On the morrow I announced that I had _thought of a story_. I  began that day with the words, _It was on a dreary night of November_,  making only a transcript of the grim terrors of my waking dream.\"    The next year Shelley and herself were in Buckinghamshire, where the  great poet wrote _The Revolt of Islam_. In the spring of 1818, they  quitted England for Italy, and their eldest child died in Rome. Soon  after, they took a house near Leghorn--half way between the city and  Monte Nero, where they remained during the summer.         \"Our villa,\" she says, \"was situated in the midst of a podere;       the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows, during       the heats of a very hot season, and at night the water-wheel       creaked as the process of irrigation went on, and the       fire-flies flashed from among the myrtle hedges:--nature was       bright, sunshiny, and cheerful, or diversified by storms of a       majestic terror, such as we had never before witnessed.\"    _The Cenci_ and several other poems were written here. The summer of  1818 they passed at the Baths of Lucca, and in the autumn went to a  villa belonging to Lord Byron, near Venice, whence they proceeded to  Naples, where the winter was spent; after which they visited Florence,  and in the fall of 1820 took up their residence at Pisa. The next  year--in July--Shelley's death occurred: he was drowned in the gulf of  Lerici. The details must be familiar to all readers of literary history.  Mrs. Shelley wrote of the time:        \"This morn thy gallant bark        Sailed on a sunny sea,      'Tis noon, and tempests dark        Have wrecked it on the lee,            Ah woe! Ah woe!      By spirits of the deep      Thou'rt cradled on the billow,      To thy eternal sleep.        Thou sleep'st upon the shore        Beside the knelling surge,      And sea-nymphs evermore        Shall sadly chant thy dirge.            They come! they come,      The spirits of the deep,      While near thy sea-weed pillow      My lonely watch I keep.        From far across the sea        I hear a loud lament,      By echo's voice for thee,        From ocean's caverns sent.            O list! O list,      The spirits of the deep;      They raise a wail of sorrow,      While I for ever weep.\"    Mrs. Shelley returned to England, and for nearly twenty years supported  herself by writing. In the last ten years--more especially since 1844,  when her son succeeded to the Shelley estates--she had no need to write  for money, and it is understood that she devoted the time to the  composition of _Memoirs of Shelley_.    The _Frankenstein_, _or Modern Prometheus_, of Mrs. Shelley,--a fearful  and fantastic dream of genius--was never very much read; it was one of  those books made to be talked of; her _Lodore_ was more easily  apprehended; it is a love story, from every-day life, but written with  remarkable boldness and directness, and a real appreciation of the  nature of both woman and man. The hero of this novel is the son of a  gentleman ennobled for his services in the American war, and some of the  scenes are in New-York. The _Last Man_ has for its hero her husband,  whose character is delineated in it with singular delicacy, but the book  is in the last degree improbable and gloomy, while abounding in scenes  of beauty and intense interest. She wrote also _Perkin Warbeck_,  _Falkner_, _Walpurga_, and other novels, _Journal in Italy and Germany_,  and _Lives of eminent French Writers_, besides editing the _Poems_ and  the _Letters_ of Shelley--a labor which she performed judiciously, and  with feeling and accuracy.    Mrs. Shelley's son succeeded to his grandfather's baronetcy on the 24th  of April, 1844, and is the present Sir Percy Florence Shelley, Bart., of  Castle Goring, in Sussex.          REV. H. N. HUDSON'S EDITION OF SHAKSPEARE.      It has been known among his friends for several years that the Rev.  Henry N. Hudson was preparing for the press an edition of the works of  Shakspeare. The office of a Shakspeare restorer and commentator at this  time is one of the most ambitious in the republic of letters. More than  any collection of works except the Holy Scriptures--to which only they  are second in dignity and importance among books--the Works of  Shakspeare demand for their fit illustration not only the most varied  and profound scholarship but the most eminent qualities of mind and  feeling. Mr. Hudson had vindicated his capacities for the noble service  upon which he has entered in his Lectures upon Shakspeare, published  about three years ago. The fame he then acquired will be increased by  his present performance, of which, we understand, the initial volume  will in a few days be published by James Munroe & Co., of Boston, who  will issue at short intervals the other ten, the last of which will  embrace a Life of the Poet by the editor. Some of the main  characteristics of this edition may be inferred from these paragraphs,  which we are enabled to make from an early copy of the preface.    \"The celebrated Chiswick edition, of which this is meant to be as near  an imitation as the present state of Shaksperian literature renders  desirable, was published in 1826, and has for some time been out of  print. In size of volume, in type, style of execution, and adaptedness  to the wants of both the scholar and the general reader, it presented a  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25341"],[0,"The 28th: A Record of War Service in the Australian Imperial Force, 1915-19, (#13)"],[1," later the return march was commenced and camp  reached some time after dark.    On the 17th July the quarantine restrictions were removed. A system was  instituted whereby 25 per cent. were able to leave camp after evening  parade on week days, 12 noon on Saturdays, and 8 a.m. on Sundays. Leave  was usually commenced by tours within the city and visits to the Mouski  for the purpose of purchasing gifts for the people at home. Here western  methods were copied by some of the shopkeepers, and a sign which read--                         SUCCOUR SALE, DRAPERIE HIGH LIFE    suggested that bargains might be hoped for. Gharri drives were popular  but some men, with humane feeling, were averse to being hauled by a  beast almost too poor and degraded to be longer termed a horse and one  which, in our own land, would have received the attention of the  S.P.C.A. The drivers of these vehicles cleared their way through the  pedestrian traffic by cries such as \"Ya meenuk\" (To the right), \"She  maluk\" (To the left), or \"Owar riglak\" (Mind your legs), repeated  incessantly.    Donkey rides seemed to provide a certain amount of amusement. The beasts  were hardy, and it was no uncommon sight to see two or three Australians  trying the speed of their mounts down one of the main  streets--enthusiastically encouraged by the donkeys' owners.  Occasionally donkey and rider were facing in opposite directions. When  tired, the soldier could go for rest to the Club established in the open  air of the Esbekieh Gardens by the Australian Red Cross Society and  Y.M.C.A. Here, comfortable seats, meals, and music could be obtained.  Other places were picture theatres, and the \"Kursaal\" and \"Casino\" where  variety entertainments were given nightly--mostly by French artists.  Some very good turns were to be seen at the Kursaal, the popular  favourite being a soprano, Mimi Pinson, who could bring the house down  by her rendering of \"Two Eyes of Grey.\" At the Casino the audience sat  about at tables and consumed cool drinks whilst listening to or watching  the performers on the stage. The feminine element predominated here, and  there was an air of friendliness about their open glances and  conversation at first somewhat bewildering to the unsophisticated. The  officers, in their peregrinations, made free use of the large  hotels--such as \"Shepheard's\" or the \"Continental,\" and the various  clubs such as the Italian and Ghezirah Sporting Clubs. Shepheard's Hotel  had been placed out of bounds to all but officers. Various reasons for  this step were suggested. What, however, is believed to have had a good  deal to do with it is the fact that during dinner on one occasion a  rather stout and pompous senior general, sitting at table with his wife  and daughters, was very affectionately greeted, embraced, and kissed by  an hilarious youth from the southern seas.    [Illustration: THE WALL OF THE CITADEL.  From which the Mameluke leaped. The twin minarets are those of  the Mehemet Ali Mosque.  _Photo. by Sergt. Arundel._]    [Illustration: THE GREAT PYRAMID.  _From the plan by C. Piazzi Smyth._]    At the commencement of all tours guides were offering freely, and were  often required. They were of two kinds. The genuine type was usually a  graduate of one of the educational institutions, and would arrange and  conduct, more or less satisfactorily, any expedition--were it to visit  the Cairo Museum, the Pyramids and other monuments, or to go duck  shooting near Alexandria or gazelle hunting in the Fayum. The other type  of guide hailed from somewhere at the back of the bazaars; he was loudly  importunate, proclaimed himself as named Macpherson, Abdullah, or  Johnson, and stated that he was \"dinkum.\" The possibilities with him  seemed extensive. Anyone who employed this kind of person, and expected  to have a kind of Arabian Nights entertainment, returned richer by his  experience but, usually, unless he was very very careful, with the  sensations of having just emerged from a garbage pit.    The Australian's interest in Egypt was immense. He had no marked  admiration for the existing inhabitants, but his reading had given him  an insatiable longing to know more of the ancients and their great  works. He let no opportunity, therefore, escape him of viewing and  studying the monuments which had withstood the ravages of time for so  many centuries. Various expeditions were arranged by bands of friends  who, after engaging a dragoman, would often pool their resources in  order that the day might be as pleasant as it was instructive. As a rule  the first expedition was to the great Pyramids at Gizeh--distant  glimpses of which can be obtained from points not far from Abbasia.  Situated about eight miles from Cairo, the route to this objective lies  through the city, across the Nile bridge, and along the delightful  causeway said to have been built by the Khedive Ismail for use by the  Empress Eugenie during her visit on the occasion of the opening of the  Suez Canal. On arrival at the village, camels and donkeys are used to  traverse the stretch of heavy sand which intervenes between the road and  the plateau upon which the Pyramids stand.    The Pyramids are three in number, but vary in size. The largest is that  of Cheops, the second that of Chephren, and the smallest that of  Menkaura. The tomb of Cheops attracts all visitors and, once having been  \"done,\" any curiosity in regard to the remainder is, as a rule, entirely  lacking. There are two ways of \"doing\" it. One is to climb up the  exterior to the summit, and the other to go inside and visit the King's  and Queen's chambers. No ordinary individual has the strength to achieve  both in the one day. The visit to the top gives the better result in a  magnificent view of Cairo, the Nile, and the surrounding desert, but  gaining this involves a climb to a height of 451 feet by means of the  several courses of stone, each course being about three feet high; nor  is the descent very much easier. To inspect the interior it is necessary  to first ascend about 30 feet to the entrance. Here, on the occasion of  the Western Australians' visit, were met the guides or caretakers  attached to the place. Bedlam instantly broke out. All wanted a job or  \"bakshish.\" Some grabbed the soldiers' sticks, others their boots and  leggings. After much remonstrance, and an occasional hard knock or kick  to some too enthusiastic native, the party, in its stockinged feet,  eventually passed within the entrance. The passage was narrow, low,  steep, and extremely slippery. With an Arab to each hand--as a  precaution against a nasty fall--the soldier, breathing a muggy  atmosphere, sweating at every pore, and filled with repulsion at the  close proximity of his yelling conductors, made a crab-like and painful  progress through darkness over the 220 feet of distance to the King's  Chamber. This apartment, viewed by candlelight or a flare now and then  from a piece of magnesium wire, does not present, beyond some carvings  on the walls, anything of great interest.    After a brief rest the party retraced some of its steps and visited the  Queen's Chamber, situated lower down. Here it was necessary to have  another breather, and at this stage some Arab evinced a desire to  foretell the fortune of anyone who would listen to him and, of course,  produce the necessary monetary encouragement. Finally, the open air was  regained, perspiration ceased to pour, and with luck it was possible to  recover those portions of clothing left behind when entering. Now  thoughts were directed to the Pyramids Hotel at Mena--noticed earlier in  the day--where, under the shade of trees, tables were set and lunch  could be obtained, together with much good and cool English ale.  Sometimes the parties had enough energy left to first pay a call on the  Sphinx, which is situated about 300 yards distant from the great tomb.  Very few thoroughly explored this relic of the ancients, but its great  antiquity, alleged by some authorities to date long prior to the  creation as fixed by the Christian calendar, and the riddle associated  with it, demanded that everyone should at least go and gaze on its face  for a little while. Here it was customary to submit to the camera man.  Many photographs were thus secured which, when posted, were of great  interest to the friends at home.    The next place of interest was the site of the City of Memphis--the  ancient capital of Egypt--and its necropolis at Sakkara. Memphis was  reached either by train or donkey ride from Cairo, or by a ride of about  two hours across from the Pyramids at Gizeh. Of the city itself nothing  is left to mark its ancient magnificence except the two giant statues of  Rameses II. However, the country between there and Gizeh is one vast  cemetery containing the tombs of the notables. The most conspicuous of  these is the Step Pyramid--the oldest of such and the resting-place of  the body of King Teheser. Less conspicuous, but more interesting to the  newcomers, were the Apis Tombs, which contain the sarcophagi of 24 of  the Sacred Bulls. These sarcophagi, complete with lids, are of an  immense size--each weighing some 65 tons. Near by are the tombs of  Ptah-hetep and Ti, in which the rich and well-preserved mural  decorations give a very full representation of the life and habits of  the inhabitants of the city in their time. Other interesting remains,  some Greek and some Roman, were also to be seen, but by this time the  average Australian had had enough for one day, and turned to the means  of getting back to the more congenial surroundings of the modern city or  camp.
