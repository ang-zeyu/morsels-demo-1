In the Windy River area nearly all the Caribou were secured with rifles.  A few, however, were speared by the Eskimo boy as they swam across Windy  Bay. The spears used here are manufactured articles of iron, fitted to a  wooden shaft.    Katello, a Kazan River Eskimo, informed Charles Schweder that his people  used to construct snow-covered pits for the Caribou to fall into. The  present generation is considered too lazy to undertake such a task.  Although information is lacking in the present case, urine may have been  employed to entice the Caribou into these pits, as reported by Hanbury  (1904: 114-115, 123, fig.).    A general deterioration of antler size in the Barren Ground Caribou  seems to constitute a case parallel with that of the European Red Deer  (_Cervus elaphus elaphus_). The reason is evidently the same in each  case--the long-continued selection by hunters of old males with the best  \"heads.\" Only the motive differs decidedly in each case: the European  hunter looks upon the antlers themselves as the main prize; the Eskimo  and the Indian are indifferent to these ornaments, but realize that the  bucks with great antlers provide the most meat and _fat_. The bucks are  said to become much fatter than the does. The Eskimos are especially  keen on getting the big bucks. According to Charles Schweder, the old  antlers left at the river crossings from bygone days are superior in  size to those of the present day. He himself has never secured a set of  antlers equal to one (fig. 25) lying on the shore of Simons' Lake; it  may have been there for 20 or 30 years prior to 1947.    From about mid-September to nearly mid-October the flesh is counted upon  as being in especially fine condition. In August, 1947, the animals had  scarcely any fat, but by the middle of September the roasts were  delicious. On October 8 the fresh strips of back fat from several bucks  weighed about 5 to 10 lbs. each. A good many of these strips were put in  a storehouse at Windy River for winter use. Charles Schweder remarked on  having seen such a piece of fat 3 inches thick. At the rutting season,  which commences about mid-October, the bucks become very poor and thin.  They neglect their feeding and do not have full stomachs, as earlier in  the season. Their fat becomes tinted with red, and the flesh becomes so  musky that even the dogs and the Wolves disdain it. (See also the  section on _Fat_.)    In some cases, when a local Caribou is being dressed, a part of the  stomach is utilized as a receptacle into which the blood is dipped from  the body cavity with the hands, in Eskimo style. The blood goes into the  making of soup. The tripe also is relished. Once I found the children of  our camp boiling up a section of the aorta as a delicacy. The ribs are  commonly impaled on a stick thrust into the ground and roasted in front  of an open fire. Leg bones may be cracked to render the raw marrow  accessible; if they are cooked, the marrow may be blown out of the open  ends with the mouth. The Padleimiut consume much of the meat in the raw  state, and frequently wash it down with hot tea.    Much needless wounding and suffering of the Caribou, as well as waste of  valuable resources, result from extensive use of such a small-calibred  rifle as the .22. It may seem remarkable that such a large animal should  succumb at all to such a slight weapon; but it does happen, usually  after a number of shots. For example, an Eskimo boy secured 13 Caribou  in a single day with a .22. On the other hand, many of the animals must  get away from the hunter, only to die, after much suffering, at a  considerable distance, where they are not likely to be recovered and  utilized. The absolute outlawing of the use of the .22 on such large  game would seem to be in order.    Once Charles Schweder shot a doe whose jaw had been broken by a bullet.  A piece of the bone had \"grown into the tongue\" but the jaw was healed.    At the Windy River post, in the latter part of summer, portions of the  caribou bodies are placed in the river not merely for refrigeration, but  for protection from blowflies. Such meat is used mainly for the dogs.  The Eskimos are said not to engage in this practice. Consequently, some  of the caribou bodies lying about their camps become masses of maggots.    On the last day of September I observed how Charles Schweder prepared a  fresh caribou body in the field and endeavored to protect it from beasts  and birds. First he cut off the head with his hunting-knife; then the  hind legs, which were severed very readily at the hip joint. Next he  opened the body cavity and pulled out the viscera, setting aside a mass  of fat (apparently the omentum). The hind legs were placed beneath the  body, and the head was thrust into the opening of the abdominal cavity,  as an obstacle to such scavengers as Herring Gulls, Rough-legged Hawks,  Canada Jays, Ravens, and Foxes (_cf._ Downes, 1943: 227, 228). The skin  was left on the body, and the whole was covered with small spruce tops.    An interesting device in the hunting of Caribou consists of \"stone men\"  (Harper, 1949: 231, fig.). They are made of rocks, piled one upon  another in such a manner as to faintly suggest a human figure. \"Moss\"  (either moss or lichens) is added to some of them to enhance the  human appearance. A considerable number may be seen in the Windy River  area, where they are generally placed along the summits of the ridges.  Construction was probably begun many years ago by natives, and has been  continued by the present residents. When Caribou, in fleeing from a  hunter, catch sight of these \"stone men,\" they are likely to pause in  suspicion of the figures, and to be deflected from their chosen course.  This may give the hunter a chance to come within range of the animals.  The Kazan River Eskimos are said to use converging lines of such rock  piles to direct migrating Caribou to certain river-crossings, where the  hunters lie in wait for them. Occasionally a single pile is erected  merely to mark the spot where a caribou body is left until the hunter  can return with a dogteam to fetch the meat.      [Transcriber's Note: \"... stone men\": Inuksuit (sing. inuksuk).]    On first securing one of the animals, the hunter makes a practice of  cutting out the tongue and carrying it to camp in a pocket or a  game-bag. On a subsequent trip, if there is sufficient snow on the  ground, the meat is generally transported by dog sleigh or toboggan  (_cf._ Harper, 1949: 231, fig.). Occasionally a hunter will carry it on  his shoulder (fig. 4) or in a pack.    In all the Canadian North, as far as I am aware, the Windy River post is  virtually the only place where summer transportation is accomplished by  dog-drawn travois (fig. 5). This device, consisting of two trailing  poles, with a small platform midway, is recognizable immediately by  readers of Parkman's _Oregon Trail_ (1849), where its use by Indians of  our Western Plains is mentioned again and again. The travois was  introduced into this region by the late Charles Planchek?, a Czech?  trapper of somewhat sinister repute, whose headquarters were at Putahow  Lake. He was the \"Eskimo Charlie\" of Downes (1943: 160-161, pl.). In  years gone by he took a travois with him on a visit to the Windy River  area, and it was thereupon copied and subsequently used regularly by the  Schweder family. Their Eskimo friends of the upper Kazan will  occasionally borrow one, but I am not aware that they have made any  travois of their own. During the summer the two younger boys of the  Windy River post made a practice of hauling in caribou meat from the  surrounding Barrens by means of travois.    In the latter part of summer some small pieces of caribou meat were  occasionally laid on a stone for drying, in front of the door at the  post. Other pieces were said to have been hung up in the air for the  same purpose, without fire or smoke, out in the field where the animals  were killed. Apparently blowflies did not pay much attention to this  meat. No considerable quantity seemed to be preserved locally in this  way. Three Caribou-eater Chipewyans from the south end of Nueltin Lake,  who visited our camp in late October, were carrying dried meat with them  as travel rations and eating it without cooking.    The larvae of the warble fly (_Oedemagena tarandi_), found beneath the  skin of the Caribou, are relished by the Eskimos, being eaten apparently  while alive and raw. The Eskimo boy of our camp continued this practice  after his little sister had given it up. Hearne (1795: 197) reported the  Indians as eating the warbles in his day.        [Illustration: FIG. 9.

The squad  should be under the leadership of a counsellor who is particularly  fitted to direct and instruct the squad and be responsible for the work  it does.    Going on duty in the middle of the afternoon gives the members an  opportunity to have a swim earlier in the day, and after going off duty  the next day, which is a privilege not to be despised. The work which  this squad does is for the benefit of the entire group and raises or  lowers the camp standard each day.    The general program should be posted on the bulletin board and explained  to each new group that enters camp. It should be given in detail as to  hours, activities and requirements. Whether the program is planned for  the group divided into two or three units or for the group as one unit,  depends upon the size of the camp. No counsellor can do justice to her  work if she has too large a group, and on the other hand, the group if  too large will lose interest in the subject. The accompanying program  has been tried and may be of value as a suggestion.

SPORTS    Every girl who goes to a camp in the summer is interested in some form  of sport. But perhaps swimming and boating head the list for popularity.    There are many interesting ways in which to run your swimming program so  that it is taught systematically and leads to real progress and  efficiency.    One method that has been tried successfully in a very large camp, but  which would apply equally well in any camp, is the arrangement of the  entire camp into groups designated as \"Swimming Classes\" and indicated  by a special color bathing cap for each group or class so that they may  be easily distinguished in the water.    [Illustration: THE TOP OF THE MORNING]    _Class Number 4, Red Cap._--All who have not passed the canoe test which  is explained under the heading \"Class Number 3.\"    _Class Number 3, Green Cap._--Pass the canoe test which consists of  swimming, floating or otherwise staying above depth for fifteen minutes,  and swimming in from an overturned canoe 20 yards from shore.    _Class Number 2, Blue Cap._      _Strokes_: Breast stroke--25 yards               Side Stroke--25 yards               Back stroke--25 yards               Single overhand--25 yards               Double overhand--25 yards    _Dives_: Standing or running dive from spring board               (3 perfect out of 5).

Back somersault, spring board               Front somersault, spring board               Sailor running, spring board               Back dive, high tower               Jack knife, high tower               Double dive, high tower    Another method is to record the swimming achievements on a chart under  the following headings:    Form swimming, ornamental swimming, speed swimming, canoe tests, life  saving and dives.    Did you ever work to become a member of the Women's Life Saving Corps of  the American Red Cross? The purpose of this organization is to train  women in all coast cities, and cities bordering on lakes and rivers, to  be able to meet emergencies in the water and save lives.    There are six tests which have to be passed before a girl is considered  worthy of a W. L. S. C. certificate.              Test 1. Jump off a low dock dressed in bathing            suit, shoes, shirt waist and skirt. Swim to a            given point, (about 20 yards), there undress and            swim in bathing suit to another dock (about 20            yards).              2. Swim down from surface in 10 feet of water and            fetch up a 2-foot birch log from bottom.              3. Rescue a non-resisting person and demonstrate            the \"carries\" (head, under-arm and side stroke) as            you bring them ashore.              4.
