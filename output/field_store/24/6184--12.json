Besides the emu, many birds of prodigious size have been seen, which  promise to increase the number of those described by naturalists,  whenever we shall be fortunate enough to obtain them; but among these  the bat of the Endeavour River is not to be found. In the woods are  various little songsters, whose notes are equally sweet and plaintive.    Of quadrupeds, except the kangaroo, I have little to say. The few met  with are almost invariably of the opossum tribe, but even these do not  abound. To beasts of prey we are utter strangers, nor have we yet any  cause to believe that they exist in the country. And happy it is for us  that they do not, as their presence would deprive us of the only fresh  meals the settlement affords, the flesh of the kangaroo. This singular  animal is already known in Europe by the drawing and description of Mr.  Cook. To the drawing nothing can be objected but the position of the  claws of the hinder leg, which are mixed together like those of a  dog, whereas no such indistinctness is to be found in the animal I am  describing. It was the Chevalier De Perrouse who pointed out this to me,  while we were comparing a kangaroo with the plate, which, as he justly  observed, is correct enough to give the world in general a good idea of  the animal, but not sufficiently accurate for the man of science.    Of the natural history of the kangaroo we are still very ignorant.  We may, however, venture to pronounce this animal, a new species of  opossum, the female being furnished with a bag, in which the young is  contained; and in which the teats are found. These last are only two in  number, a strong presumptive proof, had we no other evidence, that  the kangaroo brings forth rarely more than one at a birth. But this  is settled beyond a doubt, from more than a dozen females having  been killed, which had invariably but one formed in the pouch.  Notwithstanding this, the animal may be looked on as prolific, from the  early age it begins to breed at, kangaroos with young having been taken  of not more than thirty pounds weight; and there is room to believe that  when at their utmost growth, they weigh not less than one hundred and  fifty pounds. A male of one hundred and thirty pounds weight has been  killed, whose dimensions were as follows:         ------------------------------------------------------------------                                               Feet.             Inches.       Extreme length                            7                  3       Ditt of the tail                          3                  4 1/2       Ditto of the hinder legs                  3                  2       Ditto of the fore paws                    1                  7 1/2       Circumference of the tail of the root     1                  5       ------------------------------------------------------------------    After this perhaps I shall hardly be credited, when I affirm that the  kangaroo on being brought forth is not larger than an English mouse.  It is, however, in my power to speak positively on this head, as I have  seen more than one instance of it.    In running, this animal confines himself entirely to his hinder, legs,  which are possessed with an extraordinary muscular power. Their speed  is very great, though not in general quite equal to that of a greyhound;  but when the greyhounds are so fortunate as to seize them, they are  incapable of retaining their hold, from the amazing struggles of the  animal. The bound of the kangaroo, when not hard pressed, has been  measured, and found to exceed twenty feet.    At what time of the year they copulate, and in what manner, we know  not: the testicles of the male are placed contrary to the usual order of  nature.    When young the kangaroo eats tender and well flavoured, tasting like  veal, but the old ones are more tough and stringy than bullbeef. They  are not carnivorous, and subsist altogether on particular flowers and  grass. Their bleat is mournful, and very different from that of any  other animal: it is, however, seldom heard but in the young ones.    Fish, which our sanguine hopes led us to expect in great quantities, do  not abound. In summer they are tolerably plentiful, but for some months  past very few have been taken. Botany Bay in this respect exceeds Port  Jackson. The French once caught near two thousand fish in one day, of  a species of grouper, to which, from the form of a bone in the head  resembling a helmet, we have given the name of light horseman. To this  may be added bass, mullets, skait, soles, leather-jackets, and many  other species, all so good in their kind, as to double our regret at  their not being more numerous. Sharks of an enormous size are found  here. One of these was caught by the people on board the Sirius, which  measured at the shoulders six feet and a half in circumference. His  liver yielded twenty-four gallons of oil; and in his stomach was found  the head of a shark, which had been thrown overboard from the same ship.  The Indians, probably from having felt the effects of their voracious  fury, testify the utmost horror on seeing these terrible fish.    Venomous animals and reptiles are rarely seen. Large snakes beautifully  variegated have been killed, but of the effect of their bites we are  happily ignorant. Insects, though numerous, are by no means, even in  summer, so troublesome as I have found them in America, the West Indies,  and other countries.    The climate is undoubtedly very desirable to live in. In summer the  heats are usually moderated by the sea breeze, which sets in early;  and in winter the degree of cold is so slight as to occasion no  inconvenience; once or twice we have had hoar frosts and hail, but  no appearance of snow. The thermometer has never risen beyond 84, nor  fallen lower than 35, in general it stood in the beginning of February  at between 78 and 74 at noon. Nor is the temperature of the air less  healthy than pleasant. Those dreadful putrid fevers by which new  countries are so often ravaged, are unknown to us: and excepting a  slight diarrhoea, which prevailed soon after we had landed, and was  fatal in very few instances, we are strangers to epidemic diseases.    On the whole, (thunder storms in the hot months excepted) I know not any  climate equal to this I write in. Ere we had been a fortnight on shore  we experienced some storms of thunder accompanied with rain, than  which nothing can be conceived more violent and tremendous, and their  repetition for several days, joined to the damage they did, by killing  several of our sheep, led us to draw presages of an unpleasant  nature. Happily, however, for many months we have escaped any similar  visitations.          CHAPTER XVI.        The Progress made in the Settlement; and the Situation of Affairs at the  Time of the Ship, which conveys this Account, sailing for England.      For the purpose of expediting the public work, the male convicts have  been divided into gangs, over each of which a person, selected from  among themselves, is placed. It is to be regretted that Government did  not take this matter into consideration before we left England, and  appoint proper persons with reasonable salaries to execute the office of  overseers; as the consequence of our present imperfect plan is such, as  to defeat in a great measure the purposes for which the prisoners were  sent out. The female convicts have hitherto lived in a state of total  idleness; except a few who are kept at work in making pegs for tiles,  and picking up shells for burning into lime. For the last time I repeat,  that the behaviour of all classes of these people since our arrival in  the settlement has been better than could, I think, have been expected  from them.    Temporary wooden storehouses covered with thatch or shingles, in which  the cargoes of all the ships have been lodged, are completed; and  an hospital is erected. Barracks for the military are considerably  advanced; and little huts to serve, until something more permanent can  be finished, have been raised on all sides. Notwithstanding this the  encampments of the marines and convicts are still kept up; and to  secure their owners from the coldness of the nights, are covered in with  bushes, and thatched over.    The plan of a town I have already said is marked out. And as freestone  of an excellent quality abounds, one requisite towards the completion  of it is attained. Only two houses of stone are yet begun, which are  intended for the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. One of the greatest  impediments we meet with is a want of limestone, of which no signs  appear. Clay for making bricks is in plenty, and a considerable quantity  of them burned and ready for use.    In enumerating the public buildings I find I have been so remiss as  to omit an observatory, which is erected at a small distance from  the encampments. It is nearly completed, and when fitted up with the  telescopes and other astronomical instruments sent out by the Board of  Longitude, will afford a desirable retreat from the listlessness of a  camp evening at Port Jackson. One of the principal reasons which induced  the Board to grant this apparatus was, for the purpose of enabling  Lieutenant Dawes, of the marines, (to whose care it is intrusted) to  make observations on a comet which is shortly expected to appear in the  southern hemisphere. The latitude of the observatory, from the result of  more than three hundred observations, is fixed at 33 deg 52 min 30 sec  south, and the longitude at 151 deg 16 min 30 sec east of Greenwich. The  latitude of the south head which forms the entrance of the harbour, 33  deg 51 min, and that of the north head opposite to it at 33 deg 49 min  45 sec south.    Since landing here our military force has suffered a diminution of only  three persons, a serjeant and two privates. Of the convicts fifty-four  have perished,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3536"],[0,"The Enchanted Castle (#13)"],[1,"'t suppose anything very much happened,  anyhow.\" This, of course, was Jimmy.    \"That shows,\" remarked Gerald sweetly, \"how much you know.  The melancholy Mabel will await the tryst without success, as far  as this one is concerned.\" 'Fish, fish, other fish other fish I fry!'\" he  warbled to the tune of 'Cherry Ripe' , till Kathleen could have  pinched him.    Jimmy turned coldly away, remarking, \"When you've quite done.\"    But Gerald went on singing    \"Where the lips of Johnson smile,    There's the land of Cherry Isle.    Other fish, other fish, Fish I fry.    Stately Johnson, come and buy!\"    \"How can you,\" asked Kathleen, \"be so aggravating?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Gerald, returning to prose.    \"Want of sleep or intoxication of success, I mean. Come where no  one can hear us.    'Oh, come to some island where no one can hear,    And beware of the keyhole that's glued to an ear,'\"    he whispered, opened the door suddenly, and there, sure enough,  was Eliza, stooping without. She flicked feebly at the wainscot  with a duster, but concealment was vain.    \"You know what listeners never hear,\" said Jimmy severely.    \"I didn't, then so there!\" said Eliza, whose listening ears were  crimson. So they passed out, and up the High Street, to sit on the  churchyard wall and dangle their legs. And all the way Gerald's  lips were shut into a thin, obstinate line.    \"Now,\" said Kathleen. \"Oh, Jerry, don't be a goat! I'm simply dying  to hear what happened.\"    \"That's better,\" said Gerald, and he told his story. As he told it  some of the white mystery and magic of the moonlit gardens got  into his voice and his words, so that when he told of the statues  that came alive, and the great beast that was alive through all its  stone, Kathleen thrilled responsive, clutching his arm, and even  Jimmy ceased to kick the wall with his boot heels, and listened  open-mouthed.    Then came the thrilling tale of the burglars, and the warning letter  flung into the peaceful company of Mabel, her aunt, and the  bread-and-butter pudding. Gerald told the story with the greatest  enjoyment and such fullness of detail that the church clock chimed  half-past eleven as he said, \"Having done all that human agency  could do, and further help being despaired of, our gallant young  detective Hullo, there's Mabel!\"    There was. The tail-board of a cart shed her almost at their feet.    \"I couldn't wait any longer,\" she explained, \"when you didn't come.  And I got a lift. Has anything more happened?\" The burglars had  gone when Bates got to the strong-room.    \"You don't mean to say all that wheeze is real?\" Jimmy asked.    \"Of course it's real,\" said Kathleen. \"Go on, Jerry. He's just got to  where he threw the stone into your bread-and-butter pudding,  Mabel. Go on.    Mabel climbed on to the wall. \"You've got visible again quicker  than I did,\" she said.    Gerald nodded and resumed:    \"Our story must be told in as few words as possible, owing to the  fish-frying taking place at twelve, and it's past the half-hour now.  Having left his missive to do its warning work, Gerald de Sherlock  Holmes sped back, wrapped in invisibility, to the spot where by the  light of their dark-lanterns the burglars were still still burgling with  the utmost punctuality and despatch. I didn't see any sense in  running into danger, so I just waited outside the passage where the  steps are you know?\"    Mabel nodded.    \"Presently they came out, very cautiously, of course, and looked  about them. They didn't see me so deeming themselves unobserved  they passed in silent Indian file along the passage one of the sacks  of silver grazed my front part and out into the night.\"    \"But which way?\"    \"Through the little looking-glass room where you looked at  yourself when you were invisible. The hero followed swiftly on his  invisible tennis-shoes. The three miscreants instantly sought the  shelter of the groves and passed stealthily among the  rhododendrons and across the park, and his voice dropped and he  looked straight before him at the pinky convolvulus netting a heap  of stones beyond the white dust of the road \"the stone things that  come alive, they kept looking out from between bushes and under  trees and I saw them all right, but they didn't see me. They saw the  burglars though, right enough; but the burglars couldn't see them.  Rum, wasn't it?\"    \"The stone things?\" Mabel had to have them explained to her.    \"I never saw them come alive,\" she said, \"and I've been in the  gardens in the evening as often as often.    \"I saw them,\" said Gerald stiffly.    \"I know, I know,\" Mabel hastened to put herself right with him;  \"what I mean to say is I shouldn't wonder if they re only visible  when you're invisible the liveness of them, I mean, not the  stoniness.\"    Gerald understood, and I'm sure I hope you do.    \"I shouldn't wonder if you're right,\" he said. \"The castle garden's  enchanted right enough; but what I should like to know is how and  why. I say, come on, I've got to catch Johnson before twelve. We'll  walk as far as the market and then we'll have to run for it.\"    \"But go on with the adventure,\" said Mabel. \"You can talk as we  go.\" \"Oh, do it is so awfully thrilling!\"    This pleased Gerald, of course.    \"Well, I just followed, you know, like in a dream, and they got out  the cavy way you know, where we got in and I jolly well thought I  d lost them; I had to wait till they'd moved off down the road so  that they shouldn't hear me rattling the stones, and I had to tear to  catch them up. I took my shoes off I expect my stockings are done  for. And I followed and followed and followed and they went  through the place where the poor people live, and right down to  the river. And    I say, we must run for it.\"    So the story stopped and the running began.    They caught Johnson in his own back-yard washing at a bench  against his own back-door.    \"Look here, Johnson,\" Gerald said, \"what'll you give me if I put  you up to winning that fifty pounds reward?\"    \"Halves,\" said Johnson promptly, \"and a clout 'long-side your head  if you was coming any of your nonsense over me.\"    \"It's not nonsense,\" said Gerald very impressively. \"If you'll let us  in I'll tell you all about it. And when you've caught the burglars and  got the swag back you just give me a quid for luck. I won't ask for  more.\"    \"Come along in, then,\" said Johnson, \"if the young ladies'll excuse  the towel. But I bet you do want something more off of me. Else  why not claim the reward yourself?\"    \"Great is the wisdom of Johnson he speaks winged words.\" The  children were all in the cottage now, and the door was shut. \"I  want you never to let on who told you. Let them think it was your  own unaided pluck and far-sightedness.\"    \"Sit you down,\" said Johnson, \"and if you're kidding you'd best  send the little gells home afore I begin on you.\"    \"I am not kidding,\" replied Gerald loftily, \"never less. And anyone  but a policeman would see why I don't want anyone to know it was  me. I found it out at dead of night, in a place where I wasn't  supposed to be; and there'd be a beastly row if they found out at  home about me being out nearly all night. Now do you see, my  bright-eyed daisy?\"    Johnson was now too interested, as Jimmy said afterwards, to  mind what silly names he was called. He said he did see and asked  to see more.    \"Well, don't you ask any questions, then. I'll tell you all it's good  for you to know. Last night about eleven I was at Yalding Towers.  No it doesn't matter how I got there or what I got there for and  there was a window open and I got in, and there was a light. And it  was in the strong-room, and there were three men, putting silver in  a bag.\"    \"Was it you give the warning, and they sent for the police?\"  Johnson was leaning eagerly forward, a hand on each knee.    \"Yes, that was me. You can let them think it was you, if you like.  You were off duty, weren't you?\"    \"I was,\" said Johnson, \"in the arms of Murphy \"    \"Well, the police didn't come quick enough. But I was there a  lonely detective. And I followed them.\"    \"You did?\"    \"And I saw them hide the booty and I know the other stuff from  Houghton's Court's in the same place, and I heard them arrange  about when to take it away.\"    \"Come and show me where,\" said Johnson, jumping up so quickly  that his Windsor arm-chair fell over backwards, with a crack, on  the red-brick floor.    \"Not so,\" said Gerald calmly; \"if you go near the spot before the  appointed time you'll find the silver, but you'll never catch the  thieves.\"    \"You're right there.\" The policeman picked up his chair and sat  down in it again. \"Well?\"    \"Well, there's to be a motor to meet them in the lane beyond the  boat-house by Sadler's Rents at one o clock tonight. They'll get the  things out at half-past twelve and take them along in a boat. So  now's your chance to fill your pockets with chink and cover  yourself with honour and glory.\"    \"So help me!\" Johnson was pensive and doubtful still \"So help me!  you couldn't have made all this up out of your head.\"    \"Oh yes, I could. But I didn't. Now look here. It's the chance of  your lifetime, Johnson! A quid for me, and a still tongue for you,  and the job's done. Do you agree?\"    \"Oh, I agree right enough,\" said Johnson. \"I agree. But if you're  coming any of your larks \"    \"Can't you see he isn't?\" Kathleen put in impatiently. \"He's not a  liar we none of us are.\"    \"If you're not on, say so,\" said Gerald, \"and I'll find another  policeman with more sense.\"    \"I could split about you being out all night,\" said Johnson.    \"But you wouldn't be so ungentlemanly,\" said Mabel brightly.  \"Don't you be so unbelieving, when we're trying to do you a good  turn.\"    \"If I were you,\" Gerald advised, \"I'd go to the place where the  silver is, with two other men. You could make a nice little ambush  in the wood-yard it's close there. And I'd have two or three"]]]
