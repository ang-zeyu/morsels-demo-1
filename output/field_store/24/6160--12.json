A. McKinnon, of Canada, and as for the month of November we sold  $85.00 worth of fur, it will be easily seen that they pay for their  keep. The fox hound, like the coon dog, must be a good one, properly  bred and trained for the purpose, and they are never first class  until they are two or three years old, although I have killed foxes  ahead of dogs that were only nine months old, but these turned out to  be exceptionally good dogs, and out of a litter of six or eight  puppies half of the number may be worthless for what I call a good  fox hound is one that will hunt for his fox alone, and that will run  all day if necessary.    I went out on the first snow and in one day captured three foxes, two  of which I shot, and the other ran into a hollow log; he was running  so hard I believe he would have got into the rail if there had been  no hole at all. I also find that the morning is the best time to find  a fresh track, as it is then that Reynard is up and taking his  morning walk through the old barren meadows, and partly cleared  fields, in search of mice and other small game.    In my experience I find that the females do not move around so much  in the day time as the males do, for they are shyer than the males  and are possessed of more cunningness. In our travels we always mark  any fox dens we come across, so as to pay them a friendly call after  a fresh fall of snow.    We use the Winchester repeating shot guns, and find that for long  range and quick shooting they are the best. We sometimes use our  rifles but a fox is a small mark to shot at if he is running at full  speed. Brother trappers, get a pair of good fox hounds and you will  get more foxes than with all the traps you could set in a week.      * * *    I don't think there are many men now living that have skinned many  more fox than I have, yet I can learn every year something new about  Reynard, says O. Douglass, of Michigan. But what I do want to know is  this: I see so much about water sets, and I don't understand how it  can be done only for the fun of it. I have bought for many years, and  I have as yet to see many prime water trapped fox. They are caught  too early to be prime, and I can't see where the money comes in to  pay for your trouble.    Now trappers, don't you think it is better to make some fine dry land  sets in July or August and bait them once a week until they are  prime, and you have them coming to your beds and they are not afraid  of your work? I say this to young trappers. I have been trying all  ways for sixty years and have caught them many different ways, but I  do think the water set is the poorest way of all. Dry land sets for  me every time in November and December.    I make my beds early and I use the scrap from hog's lard. I take one  skunk scent bag to each bed to draw them to the bait, and when they  come once they will call again.    I see where a buyer was called to buy 14 fox hides and only found one  prime skin. All water caught. That is my experience with water caught  fox. They have to be caught too early. It may be different in some  localities, but not here, as the water is frozen by the time fox are  prime. Try dry land sets and see if I am not right, and have more  money for your work later on.    I always set two traps to one bed, and cover with dry dirt until it  freezes. Then I use chaff. Handle all with clean gloves and be as  cunning as a fox yourself.      [Illustration: PACK OF NEW ENGLAND FOX HOUNDS.]        CHAPTER XV.    FRED AND THE OLD TRAPPER.    Young trappers can learn much by making the rounds with experienced  trappers. The following conversation between Fred and an old  Pennsylvania trapper is interesting:    \"Where was the trap set? I do not see any bait pen.\"    \"Fred, you take this stick and walk up slowly to him; go up close and  give him a sharp blow across the back of the neck. That will fix him.  You see that big mossy log laying on the bank over there. That was  where he was caught. We will now set the trap again. See this little  sink in the log. That is where the trap was set. This limb is what  the trap was fastened to, one end on the ground and the other comes  just up to the log where the trap is set, and we will staple the trap  to it. We will now cover it with moss just like this on this log, but  we will get it from another log. No one could tell that there was a  trap there.\"    \"Will not the fox smell it?\"    \"He might if it was not for this fox carcass. We will skin the fox.  Look out there, Fred, do not disturb the moss or anything on that log  where the trap is. Keep away from that. We will put this carcass in  the little hollow and will drive a crotched stake straddle of its  neck; drive it well down; now take this stick and rake some leaves  over it, cover the neck where the stake is quite well, the rest of  the carcass only lightly. You have done it very well and the fox will  not notice what scent there is on the trap as long as that carcass is  there.\"    \"But you had no carcass there when you caught this one, and I have  heard that a fox was afraid of the scent of iron.\"    \"That is all bosh! Keep the traps free from all foreign scent and you  need not be afraid of the scent of the iron, but if you catch some  animal in the trap then you must have some of the scent of that  animal around near the trap. This will overcome what scent there is  on the trap. This, however, is only necessary with shy animals like  the fox. Coon and skunk are not afraid of what they smell.    \"How did you know that a fox would go on that log where that trap was  set?\"    \"By knowing the nature of the animal. When the fox smelt the bear  bait in the pen there we knew that he would get on the highest point  near the pen to investigate, and that point was that log.\"    \"Is this the only way you catch foxes?\"    \"No, this is only one of the many ways.\"        CHAPTER XVI.    EXPERIENCED TRAPPER'S TRICKS.    The fox is the most cunning animal we have, consequently he is the  most difficult one to trap, says C. E. Matheny, of Ohio. But like all  other animals he has a weak point, and if you attack him at this  point he will, without a doubt, fall into your snares. One of the  most important things when about to trap a fox is to have the trap  perfectly clean. The word clean, in this sense, does not allude to  freedom from rust, but means that the trap should be entirely free  from human scent. In order to avoid this, the trap must be thoroughly  washed in lye and when dry, well greased and smoked over burning  feathers. It has already been said that the fox has a very keen  scent, but it is particularly shy and scary at the least odor of the  human body. It is therefore necessary when handling the trap to use  clean buckskin, or still better, rubber gloves, and unless this  important precaution is observed success is very improbable. The next  step is to make the bed for the trap, and although there are various  ways of doing this, the following, I believe, is the best method.    The bed should be about three and a half feet in diameter, and made  of wheat, hay or buckwheat chaff. Some trappers use wood ashes, but  any of the above will be found better. The ground upon which the bed  is made should be hollowed out in the center so as to admit the trap,  and the bed should be made as hard as possible and deep enough to  cover the trap, and at the same time be perfectly level with the  ground.    When the bed is made as directed, take the trap (which should be a  No. 2 and have a chain and clog attached to it) and place it in the  hollow in the center of the bed. After setting the trap put some of  the chaff inside the jaws as high as the pan. Cover the pan with  paper so that the chaff will not prevent its working freely, and then  cover the whole with chaff and level it off so that the fox will not  suspect a trap to be there; finally bait it with fresh meat, cheese,  or better still, cracklings after lard is pressed out. Scatter them  liberally over the bed; do not tramp about the bed more than is  absolutely necessary, and cover up all foot-tracks as much as  possible.    It is a good plan to smear the trap with assafoetida or melted  beeswax, with a few drops of the oil of rhodium. These are all good  and may be employed for the purpose of deceiving a particularly  cunning fellow after all other stratagems fail. Another good plan is  to bait the bed several times before setting the trap, until the fox  begins to think that this is the best place it ever knew to find a  choice morsel ready at all hours. When a proper degree of confidence  appears to have been established then put the trap in its place and  catch him--if you can.      * * *    First take a No. 3 Blake & Lamb trap, and look around over the fields  or woods and find where the sand has washed down and is fine as wood  ashes, says F. A. Aurand, of Michigan. You will always find if you  keep close watch over the fields that a fox likes to get on the fine  sand and play or walk over and around on it for some reason, as you  will always find their tracks on the sand in the fall and spring. Now  take for bait any of the following: dead chicken, or turkey, or  beef's hind leg, but I think the best is beef's old head. Now take  the old head, dig down in the sand and set the head down in the sand  so that the jaws and nose are out of the sand about to the eyes. Now  take your traps, about three No. 3 B. & L. traps, take a stake and  fasten the rings to the stake, and drive the stake below the surface  of the sand and cover it over the top.    Now dig a small trench for the chains, lay the chains in the  trenches, a trench for each chain. Spread the traps each way from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34093"],[0,"Mink Trapping: A Book of Instruction Giving Many Methods of Trapping (#13)"],[1,"are  as easy to catch as muskrats. Now which is right? I believe here in  Washington that where there are lots of quail, rabbits and other wild  fowl that the mink is harder to catch with dead bait that he would be  if game was more scarce. But that ought not to interfere with the  mink being hard to catch. When he can get a warm meal he would be a  fool to take cold and sometimes stale meat.    I will tell you the way I catch them when they refuse dead bait.  First see that there are no broken links in your trap and that the  jaws close together good, for many trappers never look to this and  thereby lose a valuable pelt, and worst of all it teaches the mink to  be more careful next time.    Now that you have your traps in order, go to some small stream where  you see fresh mink tracks. Go up until you find there is a log across  the creek, and nine time out of ten you will see where the mink go  under the log, and now there is the place to nab him. First block up  all space under the log so as to force the mink into the water,  stones, stick or anything handy is good to stop their runway. Now set  your trap in about two inches of water. If it is too deep shovel in  some dirt and if too shallow dig a trench. Then fasten your chain to  a sliding pole and your set is complete. Splash some water on the  ground where you have stood and you have a good set that will catch  mink.    Some say that mink are afraid of iron. Well in some cases they are,  but in others they are not. For instance a mink goes out in search of  food and comes to a wire fence or a railroad track. I do not think he  will shy of that for he is used to the smell of iron and rust at that  place. But jam an old rusty trap in his den and not cover it or set a  rusty trap under old rotten bait. I don't think any mink will get  caught there. I catch as many mink with bait as without it, but when  I bait I bait with strictly fresh bait. Muskrat, quail, rabbits and  fish are all good baits. When I bait with muskrat I use the glands  for scent and fish oil when with fish. But have the traps free from  rust in all cases.    Go along a stream where the mink frequents and look for holes in the  bank, most of which are made by the muskrat, and set the trap just on  the outside squarely in front of it, says an Iowa trapper, Never set  inside the hole. Now the reason for this is that the mink will very  often just take a peep in and then go on, in which case if the trap  was set inside you would fail to get him. When if it were on the  outside you would stand a chance. Then turn the spring to one side  and set the trap so the mink will step between the jaws and not over  one, for in stepping over them the jaw strikes the foot and throws it  upwards, catching by the end of the toe or failing to catch at all.  Cover trap lightly and carefully, being careful not to get anything  on the jaws to hinder them from closing on the foot.    Another good set is at the root of a tree which has a small hole in  it. Set the trap the same as at the hole in the bank. Still another  is where the muskrats got an opening through the ice or frozen bank.  Mr. Mink is always looking for such places and is very easily caught  at them. I caught six mink in one week at a place of this kind last  winter, and would have caught still more if the water hadn't spoiled  the place. A good way to kill a mink is to strike him on the end of  the nose and stove towards the eyes. This will kill them quicker than  pounding their heads into a mush, and then the head is easily  skinned.    In regard to mink being afraid of human scent, that is all nonsense,  says a Maine trapper. They are no more afraid of human scent than a  skunk, and every trapper knows that a skunk is not. Now the way I  catch mink mostly is in ditches and springs and runs at the head of  marshes and around rivers and trout brooks.      [Illustration: A FEW DAYS CATCH.]    Find a ditch and pick out a narrow place and where the bank is quite  steep on each side, so that when a mink goes up and down he will have  to walk on the bottom of the ditch. Now get some dry sticks and begin  on each side and stop up the ditch all but in the center, the bigness  of a Blake & Lamb trap, have the sticks ten inches high and put them  very close together, because a mink will go through a very small  place.    Scoop out a hollow where the trap sets and be sure to set the trap  with spring pointing straight up or down the ditch, because if it  sets crossways and he steps on edge of pan, the jaw will knock the  foot out of the trap. Now don't forget about setting the trap right  and be sure to stop every little place so he will have to go over the  trap. Do a good job and you are sure of your mink. You don't have to  have any bait when you set this way.    Always keep your eyes open, look into every hole and ditch, and when  you see mink tracks in a place that is the place to put your traps. I  never fail to get them when I find signs of them. For the benefit of  those who haven't a marsh or ditch this is another way that I use,  and know it to be all right. Go along the brook and find the roots of  an old tree in under the bank. Build a coop with sticks, bark or  rocks, cover it over with stuff to make it tight. Make it eight  inches long and wide enough so a trap will fill the entrance.  Remember about the spring pointing in or straight out. Hollow out a  place for trap, and cover trap, chain and all, with fine dry grass or  leaves, and have the trap set level with the earth. Now for the bait,  shoot a red squirrel and cut him open from one end to the other and  hang him up in back end of coop, and you will get them if there are  any around there.    I have used all kinds of bait including muskrats, fish, birds and  chicken heads, but find squirrel to be the best. I have caught more  mink with this bait than all the others put together. In setting  traps for any animal be sure to set your trap as near as possible  where they are in the habit of traveling. Some set down anywhere and  think they ought to catch everything that comes along. You can read  lots of ways of trapping but you can't learn it all. Experience and  practice is what teaches any one to be a successful trapper, and when  you learn anything yourself you know it to be a fact.    A mink, like a man, prefers dry footing when traveling up stream,  says a Wisconsin trapper, and will always run along on an old log if  they can, in muddy places or across small bays along the bank of a  stream. Find a place where a mink makes small detours around soft  places and lay a chunk of log about 6 inches in diameter across the  place. Put a trap on the end of it. Arrange it so he will have to  make a long jump on the up stream end to reach hard footing. He will  naturally put his feet as near to the end of the log as he can so as  to make the jump, and you will have him. Use no bait or scent and  leave no signs of your presence. Make the place look natural.    It was while running a line of traps up Deer Creek last November that  mink got to disturbing my muskrat sets, says an Indiana trapper. Mr.  Mink would wait until the muskrat drowned, then he would spoil the  pelt. As usual, he got in his work rainy nights. One morning I found  a rat pretty badly torn and I began scheming at once to catch the sly  chap. I observed a shallow sand bar out in the middle of the creek,  just in front of my set, so I laid my plans at once. I cut out a  piece of sod one-half foot square, placed it on the sand bar; this  made the water over the sod two inches deep. I now took the muskrat  and placed him in the center of the piece of sod, putting his head  under the water so he would not appear dangerous, as a mink is afraid  of a large muskrat. I fixed him so that one half was under water and  the other half above. I left the fur on, you understand, so as to  make it appear more natural.    I now took four Newhouse No. 1 traps and placed one on each side of  the rat, staked out in deep water, full length of chain, so anything  caught in one trap would not disturb the others. I covered the traps  well with water soaked leaves, the grass on the sod helping to cover  traps some. You will observe that the traps are well concealed, being  two inches under water. It is well to drive stakes out of sight under  the water also. The next morning the set was not disturbed, but the  following morning, it having rained some that night, I expected  something was doing, and I was not disappointed, for on approaching  the set I saw distinctly outlined beneath the water the dark forms of  a mink and another muskrat, caught in two of the traps.    One mink I caught by placing an old rotten piece of wood on each side  of a muskrat slide, close to the water. I then covered it over with  the same material, leaving an opening at each end; then I placed a  No. 1 Newhouse trap under the water at the mouth of the tunnel. Mr.  Mink simply had to go through this runway, and of course was caught  and drowned.        CHAPTER XV.    SALT SET.    A good many trappers, both amateur and professional, speak of mink  being hard to catch. I can't see it that way, says a Pennsylvania  trapper. Really they are as easy as the water vole or skunk with me.  I simply set all my traps bare, no covering whatever, you clog your  trap when sprung. I lost a good many by so doing, so now I set bare  at all times for both skunk and mink, and I get my share of them.    I use both bait and blind set; water set I think is the best, that  is, in bitter cold weather when the ice is thick. My way of making, I  call it the ice set, is to take a piece of oil cloth or an old buggy  top cover will do, and put about five pounds of salt in same and sew  up; have it about two inches thick. Don't make it too solid, leave it  loose enough so you can work the most of the salt around the edges to  bed trap in. Now puncture with needle to let fumes of salt through;  cut a"]]]
