He is sure to hang from them  and any sportsman having dogs of that strain will enjoy the use of  his dog at once, but where it takes three or five seasons and  sometimes more to make a good dog, is when they come from exhibition  stock or from stock that have never been broken right. If a hound is  wrongly taught to hunt he will always be a crazy dog and will, if  bred, give poor hunters exactly like himself.    An Ohio Fox Hunter goes on record thus: In breeding hounds some seem  to expect great work on any line they wish to see the hound, not  stopping to think everything to its kind and everything to be perfect  must be true to his nature. The bloodhound is true to his nature with  reasonable opportunity. He is a man trailer, a large, strong dog,  built for strength and endurance but not for fleetness which all  breeders concede the 'coon dog should be built upon. Strong in my  opinion with strong jaws, good size and a good muzzle, a good scent  with as much speed and determination as you can inject into their  blood.    I am now speaking of coon dogs. They may be bred almost any way and  yet be good coon dogs but I find it is just as necessary to have them  bred from coon hunting stock as for any dog or animal to be trained  for any specific or especial purpose. It must be bred with that  object in view and as much of that blood and disposition injected  into the veins as is possible to get.    The fox hound is a special or specific type or breed of dog. He is  bred for it, built for it, trained for it and if a true type of  hound, is it. Not all well bred dogs are fox dogs nor are all well  bred horses fast. Only one in many. But in order to have grounds to  expect speed, we must have breeding, as the saying goes, \"Blood will  tell.\" Some are daffy on pedigree, others must have everything  registered, others ask only for the swing and staying qualities of  their ancestors, etc.    All breeds of hounds have some worthless, yet some may be fairly good  along some particular line and very much at fault in others. Some  have speed but cannot be got to use it, will not get in with a pack  and run to a finish. Some will run with a slow pack all right but put  them in with a fast pack and they will have their gallop out in from  one to two hours. They seem to have all the courage necessary but not  the speed. Some will go after the first fox trail they ever smell of  and others you have to train to follow.    I think this difference largely between the dog that is allowed to  run at large and one raised in a corral. One is fearful of  everything, the other fearless and full of self-confidence.  Confidence is worth much in both dog and man. So many cannot run  unless they have their noses directly over the trail and have no  driving instinct. If they lose the trail, go back and get it and  bring it up to where they lost it before. So for several times,  perhaps, before getting away, the dog running all the time, Mr. Fox  sitting down waiting, resting. You never hear of such dogs catching  or holding a fox. They seem to be willing but lack the tact and fox  sense.    I would say to breeders there are only a few characteristics  necessary for good foxhounds and every breeder should see to this  with careful study and tests. First--Courage. Do not breed a dog on  either side that has not got it. It will crop out to make you ashamed  of your dog some time. Second--Speed. It is just as natural for the  lover of a chase to want to be ahead, as for the lover of the horse  race, but we cannot all be so; often we find it easy to beat our slow  packs in the neighborhood and how we swell up and think we can best  anybody until we get away from home and get that bubble pricked.    Other qualifications as to form and shape. A dog should be compact  enough to be strong. He should be just as long as he can be to gather  quickly. A dog too long turning on all kinds of ground is like a  horse with a very long stride trying to go fast on a short track. His  stride is too long for the lay of the ground. Another qualification  and not in the least,--is voice. The dog that has no voice holds not  the highest place in his owner's pride. A good hound, one prized by  his owner and loved by the lover of the chase must do three things at  once, run fast, carry the trail and tongue well. These requisitions  make a good fox dog and if his shape and symmetry is good, he is a  valued dog.    Breeders should look to it that these qualities are bred for at the  sacrifice of everything else. There may be places, especially in very  hilly country, that a small hound is best. In this section, give me a  good, medium large dog, say from 22 to 24 inches at shoulder and  built in proportion with from 16 to 18 inches earage. Color is a  matter of taste. I believe that our English cousins breed them so  straight that the spots and marks are stamped on all alike. I have  heard it said so much that a stranger could hardly see any difference  in a pack and when the American breeder gets to giving so much  attention to their breeding, then we will soon have a true type of  hound.    Then I will say courage, driving with courage goes largely, speed and  voice, good sound chest and body, good wide head and long muzzle,  good bone and heavy forearm, good long back, good sound feet, well  padded, with black upper mouth, a hazel eye, a strong loin and not  too much flank. Regardless of color you have my ideal fox hound.        CHAPTER XV.    PECULIARITIES OF DOGS AND PRACTICAL HINTS.    Never purchase a dog from an unknown party unless the said party can  supply good references and testimonials regarding the square dealing  and the merits of his strain of dogs. If a man cannot give you this,  wait until you find one who can.    Some people are inclined to believe that a big dog cannot compete  with a smaller one. Most of them have to come to this conclusion  because they have seen some big sloppy and lazy hound, but take a  big, well built, lively, fleet and nervous hound, and full of grit  and he will hold his own and more. It is just like trying to make a  pony cover the same ground as a roadster, declares a lover of hounds.    A pup of most any large breed of dogs will make a good watch dog if  properly brought up. If fondled and played with while young by  everybody that happened to come to the house, then the dog will be  playful and friendly with people always later on. If to be made cross  and shun strangers, the pup should be reared in a lot with high board  fence to prevent him seeing what goes on outside. The owner, in  disguise, or better still some other person, should now and then  pound against the fence, look over the top so the dog gets a glimpse  at supposed intruders; partly open the gate and peek in, let the dog  make a rush towards him but slam gate shut before quite coming up,  etc. Such practice will make any dog watchful and cross towards all  strangers, and will never make friends with any but his master. For  an imposing, powerful and the best of watch dogs get a Mastiff or a  Great Dane.    It is not wise to expect too much of a new dog. Some of them will  fret and worry after their friends and home for a long time, will  hardly eat or drink, and it takes the best of care and attention to  bring good results. Eventually they will become acquainted and regain  their old form, if properly encouraged.    I never pet my dogs while hunting except after killing game which in  my opinion is pretty good policy as a dog like a man likes to have  credit for what he had done. Remember also, though contrary to the  old fashioned theory that it is just as unreasonable to ask a dog to  hunt without food as it would be to hitch up a horse and drive him  all day without either hay or grain, there has been many a good dog  called a \"quitter\" simply because he was weak from the lack of food.  As for a quitter, in my opinion a vast majority of them have never  commenced, not because they had a \"yellow streak,\" as most hunters  say, but because like the Irishman's pig, they have too many streaks  of lean. As your dog is a better friend to you than most people of  the J. Sneakum caliber, why not treat him right?    In some journals there is considerable criticism and complaints, and  sometimes one feels like steering shy of many advertisements of fox  hounds. One publication invites all persons to inform its editor  where any dog has been misrepresented and sold through its columns.  No doubt in many instances it may be the fault of the purchaser  handling a strange dog. I purchased a dog that followed at my heels  for several trips and would not leave me until one day he put his  nose in a fresh trail. The other dog was out of hearing when he went  out in a good race, tongueing in good shape, and was a No. 1 fox  hound.    When a sportsman wishes to purchase a strange hound if he desires to  get a good one he must pay the price and the way for him to not be  fooled is to deposit his money at the express office and then have  the dog sent on trial and if not satisfactory, he returns the dog and  pays the express charges one way. This is the only safe way to get a  good dog, as a man that will accept these conditions will most  certainly send you the right stuff at once and not a \"cull\", that he  has scraped somewhere for $5.00 and sells you from $15 to $30.    It's detrimental to allow a bird dog to roam and go self-hunting. Not  being restricted he gets in all sorts of mischief. Keeping at home is  the only remedy. To give ample exercise arrange a trolley in the yard  by driving two stakes into ground without projecting; fasten a strong  wire to top of posts and on this slip a ring to slide on; to this  snap the chain and the dog can run up and down the full length of  wire.

This is the title given by the Talmudists to the fifth of  the seven heavens.    3 This phrase is of constant recurrence in the Talmud. Maimonides, Yad Hach.  i. 3, makes it one of the positive commands of the Rabbins to believe \"that  there exists a first Being . . .    and that all things existing, Heaven and  Earth, and whatever is between them, exist only through the truth of his  existence.\"    4 Gabriel.
