To resist it would be construed into  treason and would bring on him the whole forces of the State. This  stratagem succeeded--Nauvoo, its legion and its general, were declared  in rebellion. His Excellency, Thomas Ford, Governor of the State of  Illinois, mustered an army, marched to the scene of conflict, took  sides with the enemy, and in fact incorporated their entire forces  with his own troops.    With this formidable force he marched to Carthage, a small town  eighteen miles from Nauvoo. He then sent a captain, named Singleton,  to take command of the Nauvoo legion, and demanded its  Lieutenant-General to repair to Carthage, and place himself in the  hands of those who had publicly combined to take his life. Sooner than  have submitted to these insults and humiliating demands, the legion  would have joyfully marched to Carthage, and cut to pieces this  cowardly band of rebels against American institutions and all the  rights of man.    But the Saints were located between two powerful States, who were now  combined against the laws, constitutions and liberties of their  country. To destroy one army, or even resist its most extravagant  demands, would be to draw upon themselves and families, the  overwhelming forces of the ferocious, ignorant, and worse than savage  beings, who had long thirsted for their plunder and their blood.    The young Prophet had no confidence in the Governor's pledge to  protect his person. He felt the hour had come, when his own blood  alone could appease the enemy, and preserve the lives of his flock. He  restrained the ardour of the legion; called upon them, by the love  they had ever borne to him as a Prophet and Apostle; and conjured  them, by the respect and confidence they had shown him as their  General, to submit to the extravagant demands of his Excellency, and  leave the event with God. He now took an affectionate leave of his  beloved legion, who were dissolved in tears; tore himself from the  embraces of his aged and widowed mother, and frantic wife and  children, and repaired to Carthage. He was accompanied by his brother  Hyrum, and the two of the Twelve, that were not abroad on foreign  missions, who would not forsake him. On the way he was cheerful but  solemn. He spoke little, but observed to those about him, _\"I am going  like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer's morning; I  have a conscience void of offence towards God, and towards all men. I  shall die innocent: and it shall yet be said of me--He was murdered in  cold blood_.\"    Arriving at Carthage, he delivered himself to his enemies; answered to  the charge in the original writ, to enforce which all the Governor's  forces had been mustered, and was then committed to prison to answer  the charge of treason.    In this dungeon he was still accompanied by the two Apostles and his  brother Hyrum, who were determined to die with him.    Here as the four friends sat in the upper room, singing hymns, on the  afternoon of the 27th day of June, 1844, the prison was suddenly  surrounded with demons in the flesh, armed with muskets and bayonets,  and their faces as black as Cain--the original murderer. These  commenced firing through the doors and windows of the prison, while a  portion assaulted and broke open the door. Hyrum suddenly fell, and  died without a groan, being pierced with four balls. Taylor fled,  wounded and bleeding, to the window, and was about to throw himself  out, when a ball aimed at his heart, hit his watch in his vest pocket,  and threw him back into the room. The other Apostle, Willard Richards,  stood and parried the guns with his hand staff, receiving slight  injury.    In the midst of all this scene, the Prophet's presence of mind did not  forsake him. He saw his brother Hyrum fall, stiffen and die. He then  exclaimed, in the anguish of his soul--\"O my brother!\" and sprang for  the window, amid showers of ball as thick as hail. He instantly threw  himself from the upper story into the midst of the bristling bayonets  of the enemy, and, on alighting, was pierced with a shower of balls,  and instantly died without a struggle or a groan.    His presence of mind, and prompt action, in thus throwing himself  among the enemy, drew them from the prison in time to save the lives  of the two Apostles, which was, no doubt, the object of this, the last  glorious act of his life.    Thus ended the mortal career of a youth who had revealed the ancient  history of a continent; restored to man the keys and powers of the  divine science of Theology; organized the Church and kingdom of God,  and revealed, and re-established those principles, which will  eventually prevail, and govern the sons of earth, in countless ages  yet unborn. \"The good shepherd,\" said Jesus, \"layeth down his life for  the sheep.\"    When the news of this horrid tragedy spread abroad, the fear of  vengeance from the Nauvoo legion seized the Governor, his troops, and  the whole gang of pirates; all fled, and even the inhabitants of the  guilty villages in the vicinity, vacated their habitations, and fled  in terror and dismay.    As the news reached Nauvoo, a thrill of horror and of anguish  unutterable ran, as with electricity, through every pulse. The legion  sprang to arms, and would have desolated the whole rebel counties, now  left unprotected, had not their judgments balanced the burning  attribute of justice which swelled their bosoms.    As it was, they smothered their resentment, and prepared for the  burial of the illustrious dead. The bodies of the two martyrs were  borne to the city; being met by the entire populace, bowed with  sorrow, bathed in tears, and their bosoms upheaved with a sense of  sorrow and outraged humanity, such as, perhaps, an entire populace at  once never felt, since man was doomed to mourn.    The Twelve, who were abroad, soon returned, soothed and comforted the  sheep, and exhorted them to union and perseverance. The work on the  temple was resumed, and finally completed, at an expense of many  hundred thousand dollars. In this holy edifice, after its dedication  to the Lord, a portion of the Priesthood received those holy washings,  anointings, keys, ordinances, oracles and instructions, which were yet  wanting to perfect them in the fulness of the Priesthood.    In the autumn of 1845, the enemy again rallied, and commenced to  desolate the borders of the Nauvoo settlements by fire and sword.    Wearied with long continued vexation and persecution, the council of  the Apostles now determined to seek peace for the Saints, amid the  far-off and almost unexplored deserts and mountains of the interior.  In February, 1846, this emigration was commenced, headed by the  Apostles and their families.    On the 24th of July, 1847, the first pioneers of this vast emigration,  headed by the President of the whole Church, Brigham Young, entered  the Valley of Great Salt Lake.    In the meantime, the beautiful Nauvoo, and its surrounding farms and  villas fell a prey to the enemy, after a vigorous defence. Its temple,  the pride and glory of America, was laid in ashes. Its last remnant  plundered, robbed of their all, sick, destitute, wounded, bleeding,  dying, at length disappeared beyond the horizon of the illimitable  plains of the west, and, for a moment, the curtain of oblivion closed  over this strange drama, and the kingdom of God seemed lost to mortal  view.    Again it rises, and what do we behold!    The banner of freedom unfurled a thousand miles from the frontiers of  the persecuting foe; its waving folds, amid the snow-clad peaks of the  Rocky mountains, inviting to liberty and light, the oppressed of every  clime; and a free and sovereign State rising, in majesty and smiling  splendour, amid the fastnesses of nature's eternal ramparts; while the  exhaustless treasures of the golden mountains of California, revealed  by the providence-guiding keys of modern Theology, are poured like a  flowing stream into the treasury of the Lord, to aid in the gathering  and subsistence of the Saints.    Can the student of Theology contemplate all these grand events and  their results, all verging to one focus, all combining to prepare the  way for the consummation of the entire volume of unfulfilled prophecy,  and still be so much at a loss as to query, like one of old, \"Art thou  he that should come; or, look we for another?\" If so, we can only  recommend, to one so slow of heart, to search the Scriptures, and all  good books extant on the subject. And, while he searches, let him turn  from his sins, and live in newness of life, and call upon God, the  Father of all, in the name of Messiah, that his understanding may be  enlightened, and his stubborn heart subdued, and constrained to yield  to the force of Truth.          CHAPTER X.    KEYS OF INITIATION IN PRACTICAL THEOLOGY.          Is't possible! A sinful man like me,      A candidate for heaven's mystery!      May I approach the gate and enter in,      Be wash'd and cleans'd from all my former sin,      Renew'd in spirit, and partake the power      Of bless'd Theology from this good hour.    The student of this deeply interesting science, who has traced, with  us, the thrilling incidents of its history on earth, till he finds it  restored in all its beauties, and its powers taking root in the earth,  to bear eternal fruit, will, doubtless, feel a desire to be instructed  in the first principles--the ordinances or means by which he may  personally partake of its benefits, and exercise its gifts.    There are certain qualifications, or personal preparations  indispensably necessary, without which, no person can be a proper  candidate for blessings so divine.    First. He must believe in Jesus Christ, and in the testimony of the  Apostle, or commissioned officer, to whom he looks for the  administration of these blessings.    Secondly.

But the substance connecting all these organs is not to be  distinguished from the element in which it floats, and the whole  structure looks like a slight web of threads in the water, without our  being able to discern by what means they are held together. Under the  microscope, however, the invisible presently becomes visible, and we  find that this Jelly-fish, like all others, has a solid gelatinous  disk.        [Illustration: Fig. 65. Young Oceania just escaped from its      reproductive calycle; magnified.]        [Illustration: Fig. 66. The same as Fig. 65, from below, still      more magnified; _t_ long tentacles., _t'_ rudimentary tentacle,      _e_ eye-speck on each side of base of tentacles.]        [Illustration: Fig. 67. Young Oceania, older than Fig. 65;      magnified.]        [Illustration: Diagram of succession of tentacles.]    Let us begin with its earlier condition. When it first escapes from  the parent Hydroid stock, the Oceania is almost spherical in form.  (See Fig. 65.) The disk is divided by four chymiferous tubes, running  from the summit to the margin, where they meet the circular tube in  which they all unite. At this time, it has but two well-developed  tentacles, opposite each other on the margin of the disk, just at the  base of two of the chymiferous tubes (Fig. 66), while two others are  just discernible in a rudimentary state, forming slight projections at  the base of the two other tubes. Fig. 66 gives a view of the animal  from below, at this stage of its growth, while Fig. 65 shows it in  profile. It will be seen by the latter how very spherical is the  outline of the disk at this period, while the proboscis, in which are  placed the mouth and digestive cavity, is quite long, and hangs down  considerably below the lower surface of the disk. As the animal  advances in age the disk loses its spherical outline, and becomes much  flattened, as may be seen in Fig. 67. It may be well to introduce here  some explanation of the law according to which the different sets of  tentacles follow each other in successive cycles of growth, since it  is a law of almost universal application in Jelly-fishes and Polyps;  and, owing to the smaller number and simpler arrangement of the  tentacles in Oceania, it may be more easily analyzed in them than in  many others, where the number and complication of the different sets  of tentacles make it very difficult to trace their relation to each  other during their successive growth. We have seen that the Oceania  begins life with only two tentacles. These form the first set, and are  marked with the number 1 in the subjoined diagram, which gives the  plan of all the different sets in their regular order. The second set,  marked 2, consists also of two, which are developed at equal distances  between the first two, i.e. at right angles with them. The third set,  however, marked 3, consists of four, as do all the succeeding sets,  and they are developed between the first and second. The fourth set  comes in between the first and third; the fifth between the third and  second; the sixth between the first and fourth; the seventh between  the fifth and second; the eighth between the third and fourth; the  ninth between the fifth and third. The ultimate number of tentacles in  the Oceania is thirty-two, or sometimes thirty-six, and the cycles  always in twos or multiples of two. But whatever be the number  included in the successive sets of tentacles, and the unit for the  first set ranges from two to forty-eight, the law in different kinds  of Jelly-fishes is always the same, the youngest set always forming  between the oldest preceding set. Thus the fourth set comes in between  the first and third, and the fifth between the second and third, the  intervals occupied now by the fourth set, being limited by the first  set of tentacles on one side, and by the third set on the other side,  while the intervals occupied by the fifth set are bounded by the  second and third sets.        [Illustration: Fig. 68. Adult Oceania; natural size.]    The little spheres represented between the tentacles on the margin of  the disk, in Figs. 65-67, are eye-specks, and these continue to  increase in number with age; in this the Oceania differs from the  Eucope, in which it will be remembered there were but two eye-specks  in each quarter-segment of the disk throughout life. Fig. 68  represents the adult Oceania in full size, when it averages from an  inch and a half to two inches in diameter. It is slow and languid in  its movements, coming to the surface only in the hottest hours of the  summer days; at such times it basks in the sun, turning lazily about,  and dragging its tentacles after it with seeming effort. Sometimes it  remains for hours suspended in the water, not moving even its  tentacles, and offering a striking contrast to its former great  activity when young, and to the lively little Eucope, which darts  through the water at full speed, hardly stopping to rest for a moment.  If the Oceania be disturbed it flattens its disk, and folds itself up  somewhat in the shape of a bale (see Fig. 69), remaining perfectly  still, with the tentacles stretching in every direction. When the  cause of alarm is removed, it gently expands again, resuming its  natural outline and indolent attitudes. The number of these animals is  amazing. At certain seasons, when the weather is favorable, the  surface of the sea may be covered with them, for several miles, so  thickly that their disks touch each other. Thus they remain packed  together in a dense mass, allowing themselves to be gently drifted  along by the tide till the sun loses its intensity, when they retire  to deeper waters. Some points, not yet observed, are still wanting to  complete the history of this Jelly-fish. By comparing such facts,  however, as are already collected respecting it, with our fuller  knowledge of the same process of growth in the Eucope, Tima, and  Melicertum, we may form a tolerably correct idea of its development.  It is hatched from a Campanularia.        [Illustration: Fig. 69. Attitude assumed by Oceania when      disturbed.]      _Clytia_. (_Clytia bicophora_ AG.)    In Figs. 70-73 we have the Acalephian and Hydroid stages of the Clytia  (Fig. 73), another very pretty little Jelly-fish, closely allied to  the Oceania. When first hatched, like the Oceania, it is very convex,  almost thimble-shaped (see Fig. 70), but a little later the disk  flattens and becomes more open, as in Fig. 71. In Fig. 72, we have a  branch of the Hydroid, a Campanularia, greatly magnified, with the  annulated reproductive calycle attached to it, and crowded with  Jelly-fishes ready to make their escape as soon as the calycle bursts.  The adult Clytia (Fig. 73) is somewhat smaller and more active than  the Oceania, and is easily recognized by the black base of its  tentacles, at their point of juncture with the margin of the disk. It  is more commonly found at night, than in the day-time, being nocturnal  in its habits.        [Illustration: Fig. 70. Young Clytia just escaped from the      reproductive calycle.]        [Illustration: Fig. 71. Clytia somewhat older than Fig. 70.]        [Illustration: Fig. 72. Magnified portion of Hydrarium of Clytia.]        [Illustration: Fig. 73. Adult Clytia; twice natural size.]      _Zygodactyla_. (_Zygodactyla groenlandica_ AG.)    Little has been known, and still less published, of this remarkable  genus of Jelly-fish (Figs. 74, 75) up to the present time. The name  Zygodactyla, or Twinfinger, was given to it by Brandt, from drawings  made by Mertens, who had some opportunity of studying it in his  journey around the world. These drawings were published in the  Transactions of the St. Petersburg Academy. In the year 1848 Professor  Agassiz read a paper upon one of the species of this genus belonging  to our coast, before the American Academy, in which he called it  Rhacostoma, not being aware that it had already received a name, and  gave some account of its extraordinary phosphorescent properties. The  name Rhacostoma must of course yield to that of Zygodactyla, which has  a prior claim.        [Illustration: Fig. 74. Zygodactyla seen from above.]    The average size of this Jelly-fish when full grown is from seven to  eight inches in diameter; sometimes it may measure even ten or eleven,  but this is rather rare. The light-violet colored disk is exceedingly  delicate and transparent, its edge being fringed with long fibrous  tentacles, tinged with darker violet at their point of juncture with  the disk, and hanging down a yard and more when fully extended, though  they vary in length according to the size of the specimen, and, in  consequence of their contractile power, may seem much shorter at some  moments than at others. The radiating tubes in this Jelly-fish are  exceedingly numerous, the whole inner surface of the disk being ribbed  with them. (See Figs. 74 and 75.) The ovaries follow the length of the  tubes, though they do not extend quite to their extremity, where they  join the circular tube around the margin of the disk; nor do they  start exactly at the point where the tubes diverge from the central  cavity, but a little below it. (Fig. 74.) Each ovary consists of a  long, brownish, flat bag, split along the middle, so closely folded  together that it seems like a flat blade attached along the length of  the tube. Perhaps a better comparison would be to a pea-pod greatly  elongated, with the edges split along their line of juncture, and  attached to a tube of the same length. The ovaries are not perfectly  straight, but slightly waving, as may be seen in Fig. 74, and these  undulations are stronger when the ovaries are crowded with eggs, as is  the case at the"]]]
