But as he was in peril about Pamphylia, and obliged to cast out  the greatest part of the ship's lading, he with difficulty got safe  to Rhodes, a place which had been grievously harassed in the war with  Cassius. He was there received by his friends, Ptolemy and Sappinius;  and although he was then in want of money, he fitted up a three-decked  ship of very great magnitude, wherein he and his friends sailed to  Brundusium, 21 and went thence to Rome with all speed; where he first  of all went to Antony, on account of the friendship his father had with  him, and laid before him the calamities of himself and his family; and  that he had left his nearest relations besieged in a fortress, and  had sailed to him through a storm, to make supplication to him for  assistance.    4. Hereupon Antony was moved to compassion at the change that had been  made in Herod's affairs, and this both upon his calling to mind how  hospitably he had been treated by Antipater, but more especially on  account of Herod's own virtue; so he then resolved to get him made king  of the Jews, whom he had himself formerly made tetrarch. The contest  also that he had with Antigonus was another inducement, and that of no  less weight than the great regard he had for Herod; for he looked upon  Antigonus as a seditious person, and an enemy of the Romans; and as for  Caesar, Herod found him better prepared than Antony, as remembering  very fresh the wars he had gone through together with his father, the  hospitable treatment he had met with from him, and the entire good-will  he had showed to him; besides the activity which he saw in Herod  himself. So he called the senate together, wherein Messalas, and after  him Atratinus, produced Herod before them, and gave a full account of  the merits of his father, and his own good-will to the Romans. At the  same time they demonstrated that Antigonus was their enemy, not only  because he soon quarreled with them, but because he now overlooked the  Romans, and took the government by the means of the Parthians. These  reasons greatly moved the senate; at which juncture Antony came in, and  told them that it was for their advantage in the Parthian war that Herod  should be king; so they all gave their votes for it. And when the senate  was separated, Antony and Caesar went out, with Herod between them;  while the consul and the rest of the magistrates went before them, in  order to offer sacrifices, and to lay the decree in the Capitol. Antony  also made a feast for Herod on the first day of his reign.              CHAPTER 15.           Antigonus Besieges Those That Were In Masada, Whom Herod       Frees From Confinement When He Came Back From Rome, And       Presently Marches To Jerusalem Where He Finds Silo Corrupted       By Bribes.    1. Now during this time Antigonus besieged those that were in Masada,  who had all other necessaries in sufficient quantity, but were in want  of water; on which account Joseph, Herod's brother, was disposed to run  away to the Arabians, with two hundred of his own friends, because he  had heard that Malichus repented of his offenses with regard to Herod;  and he had been so quick as to have been gone out of the fortress  already, unless, on that very night when he was going away, there had  fallen a great deal of rain, insomuch that his reservoirs were full of  water, and so he was under no necessity of running away. After which,  therefore, they made an irruption upon Antigonus's party, and slew a  great many of them, some in open battles, and some in private ambush;  nor had they always success in their attempts, for sometimes they were  beaten, and ran away.    2. In the mean time Ventidius, the Roman general, was sent out of Syria,  to restrain the incursions of the Parthians; and after he had done that,  he came into Judea, in pretense indeed to assist Joseph and his party,  but in reality to get money of Antigonus; and when he had pitched his  camp very near to Jerusalem, as soon as he had got money enough, he went  away with the greatest part of his forces; yet still did he leave Silo  with some part of them, lest if he had taken them all away, his taking  of bribes might have been too openly discovered. Now Antigonus hoped  that the Parthians would come again to his assistance, and therefore  cultivated a good understanding with Silo in the mean time, lest any  interruption should be given to his hopes.    3. Now by this time Herod had sailed out of Italy, and was come to  Ptolemais; and as soon as he had gotten together no small army of  foreigners, and of his own countrymen, he marched through Galilee  against Antigonus, wherein he was assisted by Ventidius and Silo, both  whom Dellius, 22 a person sent by Antony, persuaded to bring Herod  [into his kingdom]. Now Ventidius was at this time among the cities, and  composing the disturbances which had happened by means of the Parthians,  as was Silo in Judea corrupted by the bribes that Antigonus had given  him; yet was not Herod himself destitute of power, but the number of his  forces increased every day as he went along, and all Galilee, with few  exceptions, joined themselves to him. So he proposed to himself to set  about his most necessary enterprise, and that was Masada, in order to  deliver his relations from the siege they endured. But still Joppa stood  in his way, and hindered his going thither; for it was necessary to take  that city first, which was in the enemies' hands, that when he should  go to Jerusalem, no fortress might be left in the enemies' power behind  him. Silo also willingly joined him, as having now a plausible occasion  of drawing off his forces [from Jerusalem]; and when the Jews pursued  him, and pressed upon him, [in his retreat,] Herod made all excursion  upon them with a small body of his men, and soon put them to flight, and  saved Silo when he was in distress.    4. After this Herod took Joppa, and then made haste to Masada to free  his relations. Now, as he was marching, many came in to him, induced by  their friendship to his father, some by the reputation he had already  gained himself, and some in order to repay the benefits they had  received from them both; but still what engaged the greatest number on  his side, was the hopes from him when he should be established in his  kingdom; so that he had gotten together already an army hard to be  conquered. But Antigonus laid an ambush for him as he marched out,  in which he did little or no harm to his enemies. However, he easily  recovered his relations again that were in Masada, as well as the  fortress Ressa, and then marched to Jerusalem, where the soldiers that  were with Silo joined themselves to his own, as did many out of the  city, from a dread of his power.    5. Now when he had pitched his camp on the west side of the city, the  guards that were there shot their arrows and threw their darts at them,  while others ran out in companies, and attacked those in the forefront;  but Herod commanded proclamation to be made at the wall, that he was  come for the good of the people and the preservation of the city,  without any design to be revenged on his open enemies, but to grant  oblivion to them, though they had been the most obstinate against him.  Now the soldiers that were for Antigonus made a contrary clamor, and did  neither permit any body to hear that proclamation, nor to change their  party; so Antigonus gave order to his forces to beat the enemy from the  walls; accordingly, they soon threw their darts at them from the towers,  and put them to flight.    6. And here it was that Silo discovered he had taken bribes; for he set  many of the soldiers to clamor about their want of necessaries, and to  require their pay, in order to buy themselves food, and to demand that  he would lead them into places convenient for their winter quarters;  because all the parts about the city were laid waste by the means of  Antigonus's army, which had taken all things away. By this he moved the  army, and attempted to get them off the siege; but Herod went to the  captains that were under Silo, and to a great many of the soldiers, and  begged of them not to leave him, who was sent thither by Caesar, and  Antony, and the senate; for that he would take care to have their wants  supplied that very day. After the making of which entreaty, he went  hastily into the country, and brought thither so great an abundance  of necessaries, that he cut off all Silo's pretenses; and in order to  provide that for the following days they should not want supplies, he  sent to the people that were about Samaria [which city had joined itself  to him] to bring corn, and wine, and oil, and cattle to Jericho. When  Antigonus heard of this, he sent some of his party with orders to  hinder, and lay ambushes for these collectors of corn. This command was  obeyed, and a great multitude of armed men were gathered together about  Jericho, and lay upon the mountains, to watch those that brought the  provisions. Yet was Herod not idle, but took with him ten cohorts, five  of them were Romans, and five were Jewish cohorts, together with  some mercenary troops intermixed among them, and besides those a few  horsemen, and came to Jericho; and when he came, he found the city  deserted, but that there were five hundred men, with their wives and  children, who had taken possession of the tops of the mountains; these  he took, and dismissed them, while the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2853"],[0,"Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero (#13)"],[1,"also. Among the columns, at the  side of white statues of the Danaides and others, representing gods or  heroes, crowds of people flowed past,--men and women; resembling statues  also, for they were draped in togas, pepluses, and robes, falling with  grace and beauty toward the earth in soft folds, on which the rays of  the setting sun were expiring. A gigantic Hercules, with head in the  light yet, from the breast down sunk in shadow cast by the columns,  looked from above on that throng. Acte showed Lygia senators in  wide-bordered togas, in colored tunics, in sandals with crescents on  them, and knights, and famed artists; she showed her Roman ladies, in  Roman, in Grecian, in fantastic Oriental costume, with hair dressed in  towers or pyramids, or dressed like that of the statues of goddesses,  low on the head, and adorned with flowers. Many men and women did Acte  call by name, adding to their names histories, brief and sometimes  terrible, which pierced Lygia with fear, amazement, and wonder. For her  this was a strange world, whose beauty intoxicated her eyes, but whose  contrasts her girlish understanding could not grasp. In those twilights  of the sky, in those rows of motionless columns vanishing in the  distance, and in those statuesque people, there was a certain lofty  repose. It seemed that in the midst of those marbles of simple lines  demigods might live free of care, at peace and in happiness. Meanwhile  the low voice of Acte disclosed, time after time, a new and dreadful  secret of that palace and those people. See, there at a distance is the  covered portico on whose columns and floor are still visible red stains  from the blood with which Caligula sprinkled the white marble when he  fell beneath the knife of Cassius Chaerea; there his wife was slain;  there his child was dashed against a stone; under that wing is the  dungeon in which the younger Drusus gnawed his hands from hunger; there  the elder Drusus was poisoned; there Gemellus quivered in terror, and  Claudius in convulsions; there Germanicus suffered,--everywhere those  walls had heard the groans and death-rattle of the dying; and those  people hurrying now to the feast in togas, in colored tunics, in  flowers, and in jewels, may be the condemned of to-morrow; on more than  one face, perhaps, a smile conceals terror, alarm, the uncertainty of  the next day; perhaps feverishness, greed, envy are gnawing at this  moment into the hearts of those crowned demigods, who in appearance  are free of care. Lygia's frightened thoughts could not keep pace with  Acte's words; and when that wonderful world attracted her eyes with  increasing force, her heart contracted within her from fear, and in  her soul she struggled with an immense, inexpressible yearning for the  beloved Pomponia Graecina, and the calm house of Aulus, in which love,  and not crime, was the ruling power.    Meanwhile new waves of guests were flowing in from the Vicus Apollinis.  From beyond the gates came the uproar and shouts of clients, escorting  their patrons. The courtyard and the colonnades were swarming with the  multitude of Caesar's slaves, of both sexes, small boys, and pretorian  soldiers, who kept guard in the palace. Here and there among dark or  swarthy visages was the black face of a Numidian, in a feathered helmet,  and with large gold rings in his ears. Some were bearing lutes and  citharas, hand lamps of gold, silver, and bronze, and bunches of  flowers, reared artificially despite the late autumn season. Louder and  louder the sound of conversation was mingled with the splashing of the  fountain, the rosy streams of which fell from above on the marble and  were broken, as if in sobs.    Acte had stopped her narration; but Lygia gazed at the throng, as if  searching for some one. All at once her face was covered with a blush,  and from among the columns came forth Vinicius with Petronius. They  went to the great triclinium, beautiful, calm, like white gods, in their  togas. It seemed to Lygia, when she saw those two known and friendly  faces among strange people, and especially when she saw Vinicius, that  a great weight had fallen from her heart. She felt less alone. That  measureless yearning for Pomponia and the house of Aulus, which had  broken out in her a little while before, ceased at once to be painful.  The desire to see Vinicius and to talk with him drowned in her other  voices. In vain did she remember all the evil which she had heard of the  house of Caesar, the words of Acte, the warnings of Pomponia; in spite of  those words and warnings, she felt all at once that not only must she be  at that feast, but that she wished to be there. At the thought that soon  she would hear that dear and pleasant voice, which had spoken of love to  her and of happiness worthy of the gods, and which was sounding like a  song in her ears yet, delight seized her straightway.    But the next moment she feared that delight. It seemed to her that she  would be false to the pure teaching in which she had been reared, false  to Pomponia, and false to herself. It is one thing to go by constraint,  and another to delight in such a necessity. She felt guilty, unworthy,  and ruined.    Despair swept her away, and she wanted to weep. Had she been alone, she  would have knelt down and beaten her breast, saying, \"Mea culpa! mea  culpa!\" Acte, taking her hand at that moment, led her through the  interior apartments to the grand triclinium, where the feast was to  be. Darkness was in her eyes, and a roaring in her ears from internal  emotion; the beating of her heart stopped her breath. As in a dream, she  saw thousands of lamps gleaming on the tables and on the walls; as in  a dream, she heard the shout with which the guests greeted Caesar; as  through a mist, she saw Caesar himself. The shout deafened her, the  glitter dazzled, the odors intoxicated; and, losing the remnant of her  consciousness, she was barely able to recognize Acte, who seated her at  the table and took a place at her side.    But after a while a low and known voice was heard at the other side,--\"A  greeting, most beautiful of maidens on earth and of stars in heaven. A  greeting to thee, divine Callina!\"    Lygia, having recovered somewhat, looked up; at her side was Vinicius.  He was without a toga, for convenience and custom had enjoined to cast  aside the toga at feasts. His body was covered with only a sleeveless  scarlet tunic embroidered in silver palms. His bare arms were ornamented  in Eastern fashion with two broad golden bands fastened above the elbow;  below they were carefully stripped of hair. They were smooth, but too  muscular,--real arms of a soldier, they were made for the sword and the  shield. On his head was a garland of roses. With brows joining above the  nose, with splendid eyes and a dark complexion, he was the impersonation  of youth and strength, as it were. To Lygia he seemed so beautiful  that though her first amazement had passed, she was barely able to  answer,--\"A greeting, Marcus.\"    \"Happy,\" said he, \"are my eyes, which see thee; happy my ears, which  hear thy voice, dearer to me than the sound of lutes or citharas. Were  it commanded me to choose who was to rest here by my side at this feast,  thou, Lygia, or Venus, I would choose thee, divine one!\"    And he looked at the maiden as if he wished to sate himself with the  sight of her, to burn her eyes with his eyes. His glance slipped from  her face to her neck and bare arms, fondled her shapely outlines,  admired her, embraced her, devoured her; but besides desire, there was  gleaming in him happiness, admiration, and ecstasy beyond limit.    \"I knew that I should see thee in Caesar's house,\" continued he; \"but  still, when I saw thee, such delight shook my whole soul, as if a  happiness entirely unexpected had met me.\"    Lygia, having recovered herself and feeling that in that throng and in  that house he was the only being who was near to her, began to converse  with him, and ask about everything which she did not understand and  which filled her with fear. Whence did he know that he would find her in  Caesar's house? Why is she there? Why did Caesar take her from Pomponia?  She is full of fear where she is, and wishes to return to Pomponia. She  would die from alarm and grief were it not for the hope that Petronius  and he will intercede for her before Caesar.    Vinicius explained that he learned from Aulus himself that she had been  taken. Why she is there, he knows not. Caesar gives account to no one of  his orders and commands. But let her not fear. He, Vinicius, is near her  and will stay near her. He would rather lose his eyes than not see her;  he would rather lose his life than desert her. She is his soul, and  hence he will guard her as his soul. In his house he will build to her,  as to a divinity, an altar on which he will offer myrrh and aloes,  and in spring saffron and apple-blossoms; and since she has a dread of  Caesar's house, he promises that she shall not stay in it.    And though he spoke evasively and at times invented, truth was to  be felt in his voice, because his feelings were real. Genuine pity  possessed him, too, and her words went to his soul so thoroughly that  when she began to thank him and assure him that Pomponia would love him  for his goodness, and that she herself would be grateful to him all  her life, he could not master his emotion, and it seemed to him that  he would never be able in life to resist her prayer. The heart began to  melt in him. Her beauty intoxicated his senses, and he desired her;  but at the same time he felt that she was very dear to him, and that  in truth he might do homage to her, as to a divinity; he felt also  irresistible need of speaking of her beauty and of his own homage. As  the noise at the feast increased, he drew nearer to her, whispered kind,  sweet words flowing from the depth of his soul, words as resonant as  music and intoxicating as"]]]
