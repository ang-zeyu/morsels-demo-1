Ah Sing must be making quite a  profit out of the slave business. I'll bet he shipped two hundred to  China last year.\"    He glanced quizzically at his associate.    \"By the way, _mynheer_,\" he observed, \"you ought to know something about  that. I understand you get a per cent on it.\"    \"I?\" Muller exclaimed, and looked affrightedly about him. \"I,  _kapitein_?\"    \"Oh, yes you do,\" Van Slyck asserted airily. \"You've got money invested  with Ah Sing in two proas that are handling that end of the business.  And it's the big end just now. The merchandise pickings are small, and  that is all I share in.\"    He looked at Muller meaningly. There was menace in his eyes and menace  in his voice as he announced:    \"I'm only mentioning this, _mynheer_, so that if the new resident should  happen to be one of us, with a claim to the booty, his share comes out  of your pot, not mine. Remember that!\"    For once cupidity overcame Muller's fear of the sharp-witted cynical  soldier.    \"_Wat de drommel_,\" he roared, \"do you expect me to pay all, _kapitein_,  all? Not in a thousand years! If there must be a division you shall give  up your per cent as well as I, _stuiver_ for _stuiver_, _gulden_ for  _gulden_!\"    A hectic spot glowed in each of Van Slyck's cheeks, and his eyes  glittered. Muller's anger rose.    \"Ah Sing shall decide between us,\" he cried heatedly. \"You cannot rob me  in that way, _kapitein_.\"    Van Slyck turned on his associate with an oath. \"Ah Sing be damned.  We'll divide as I say, or--\"    The pause was more significant than words. Muller's ruddy face paled.  Van Slyck tapped a forefinger significantly on the arm of his chair.    \"Just remember, if the worst comes to the worst, there's this one  difference between you and me, _mynheer_. I'm not afraid to die, and  you--are!\" He smiled.    Muller's breath came thickly, and he stared fascinatedly into the  evilly handsome face of the captain, whose eyes were fixed on his with a  basilisk glare. Several seconds passed; then Van Slyck said:    \"See that you remember these things, _mynheer_, when our next accounting  comes.\"    The silence that followed was broken by the rhythmic pad-pad of wicker  sandals on a bamboo floor. Cho Seng came on the veranda, bearing a tray  laden with two glasses of finest crystal and a decanter of colorless  liquid, both of which he placed on a small porch table. Drops of dew  formed thickly on the chilled surface of the decanter and rolled off  while the Chinaman mixed the juices of fruits and crushed leaves with  the potent liquor. The unknown discoverer of the priceless recipe he  used receives more blessings in the Indies daily than all the saints on  the calendar. When Cho Seng had finished, he withdrew. Muller swallowed  the contents of his glass in a single gulp. Van Slyck sipped leisurely.  Gradually the tension lessened. After a while, between sips, the captain  remarked:    \"I hear you have a chance to pick up some prize money.\"    Muller looked up with interest. \"So, _kapitein_!\" he exclaimed with  forced jocularity. \"Have you found a place where guilders grow on  trees?\"    \"Almost as good as that,\" Van Slyck replied, playing his fish.    Finesse and indirection were not Muller's forte. \"Well, tell us about  it, _kapitein_,\" he demanded bluntly.    Van Slyck's eyes twinkled.    \"Catch Koyala,\" he replied.    The captain's meaning sank into Muller's mind slowly. But as  comprehension began to dawn upon him, his face darkened. The veins  showed purple under the ruddy skin.    \"You are too clever this morning, _kapitein_,\" he snarled. \"Let me  remind you that this is your duty. The _controlleur_ sits as judge, he  does not hunt the accused.\"    Van Slyck laughed.    \"And let me remind you, _mynheer_, that I haven't received the  governor's orders as yet, although they reached you more than a week  ago.\" Ironically he added: \"You must not let your friendship with Koyala  blind you to your public duties, _mynheer_.\"    Muller's face became darker still. He had not told any one, and the fact  that the orders seemed to be public property both alarmed and angered  him.    \"How did you hear of it?\" he demanded.    \"Not from you, _mynheer_,\" Van Slyck mocked. \"I really do not remember  who told me.\" (As a matter of fact it was Wang Fu, the Chinese  merchant.)    Muller reflected that officers from the gun-boat which carried Van  Schouten's mandate might have told more than they should have at the  stockade. But Koyala had received his warning a full week before, so she  must be safely hidden in the jungle by now, he reasoned. Pulling himself  together, he replied urbanely:    \"Well, _kapitein_, it is true that I have rather neglected that matter.  I intended to speak to you to-day. His excellency orders Koyala Bintang  Burung's arrest.\"    \"The argus pheasant,\" Van Slyck observed, \"is rarely shot. It must be  trapped.\"    \"_Nu, kapitein_, that is a chance for you to distinguish yourself,\"  Muller replied heartily, confident that Van Slyck could never land  Koyala.    Van Slyck flecked the ash from his cigar and looked at the glowing coal  thoughtfully.    \"It seems to me that you might be of material assistance, _mynheer_,\" he  observed.    \"In what way?\"    \"I have noticed that the witch-woman is not--er--\" He glanced at Muller  quizzically, wondering how far he might venture to go--\"not altogether  indifferent to you.\"    Muller drew a deep breath. His ruddy face became a grayish purple. His  clenched hands gripped each other until the bones crunched and the veins  stood in ridges. Drops of perspiration gathered on his forehead, he  wiped them away mechanically.    \"_Kapitein!_\" he gasped.    Van Slyck looked at him increduously, for he had not dreamed Muller's  feelings ran so deeply.    \"You think--she--sometimes thinks of me?\"    Van Slyck's nimble wits were calculating the value to him of this new  weakness of the _controlleur_. He foresaw infinite possibilities,  Muller in love would be clay in his hands.    \"I am positive, _mynheer_,\" he assured with the utmost gravity.    \"_Kapitein_, do not make a mistake,\" Muller entreated. His voice  trembled and broke. \"Are you absolutely sure?\"    Van Slyck restrained a guffaw with difficulty. It was so  ridiculous--this mountain of flesh, this sweaty, panting porpoise in his  unwashed linen in love with the slender, graceful Koyala. He choked and  coughed discreetly.    \"I am certain, _mynheer_,\" he assured.    \"Tell me, _kapitein_, what makes you think so?\" Muller begged.    Van Slyck forced himself to calmness and a judicial attitude.    \"You know I have seen something of women, _mynheer_,\" he replied  gravely. \"Both women here and in the best houses in Amsterdam, Paris,  and London. Believe me, they are all the same--a fine figure of a man  attracts them.\"    He ran his eye over Muller's form in assumed admiration.    \"You have a figure any woman might admire, _mynheer_. I have seen  Koyala's eyes rest on you, and I know what she was thinking. You have  but to speak and she is yours.\"    \"Say you so, _kapitein_!\" Muller cried ecstatically.    \"Absolutely,\" Van Slyck assured. His eyes narrowed. The devilish humor  incarnate in him could not resist the temptation to harrow this tortured  soul. Watching Muller closely, he inquired:    \"Then I can expect you to spread the net, _mynheer_?\"    The light died in Muller's eyes. A slow, volcanic fury succeeded it. He  breathed deeply and exhaled the breath in an explosive gasp. His hands  clenched and the veins in his forehead became almost black. Van Slyck  and he leaped to their feet simultaneously.    \"Kapitein Van Slyck,\" he cried hoarsely, \"you are a scoundrel! You would  sell your own mother. Get out of my sight, or God help you, I will break  you in two.\"    The door of the _controlleur's_ dwelling opened. Muller leaped back, and  Van Slyck's hand leaped to his holster.    \"I am here, Kapitein Van Slyck,\" a clear, silvery voice announced  coolly.    Koyala stood in the doorway.          CHAPTER VIII    KOYALA'S WARNING      For a moment no one spoke. Koyala, poised lightly on her feet, her  slender, shapely young figure held rigidly and her chin uptilted, gazed  steadily at Van Slyck. Her black eyes blazed a scornful defiance. Before  her contempt even the proud Amsterdammer's arrogance succumbed. He  reddened shamefacedly under his tan.    \"I am here, Kapitein Van Slyck,\" Koyala repeated clearly. She stepped  toward him and reached out a slender, shapely arm, bare to the shoulder.  \"Here is my arm, where are your manacles, _kapitein_?\"    \"Koyala!\" Muller gasped huskily. His big body was trembling with such  violence that the veranda shook.    \"This is my affair, _mynheer_,\" Koyala declared coldly, without removing  her eyes from Van Slyck. She placed herself directly in front of the  captain and crossed her wrists.    \"If you have no irons, use a cord, _kapitein_,\" she taunted. \"But bind  fast. The Argus Pheasant is not easily held captive.\"    Van Slyck thrust her roughly aside.    \"Let's have done with this foolishness,\" he exclaimed bruskly.    \"What folly, _mynheer kapitein_?\" Koyala demanded frigidly.    \"You had no business eavesdropping. If you heard something unpleasant  you have only yourself to blame.\"    Koyala's eyes sparkled with anger.    \"Eavesdropping, _kapitein_? I came here with a message of great  importance to _mynheer_ the _controlleur_. Even the birds cock their  ears to listen when they hear the hunter approach, _kapitein_.\"    Turning her back with scornful indifference on Van Slyck, she crossed  over to Muller and placed both her hands on his shoulder. Another fit of  trembling seized the acting resident and his eyes swam.    \"You will forgive me, will you not, _mynheer_, for taking such liberties  in your house?\"    \"Of--of course,\" Muller stammered.    \"I heard a little of what"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3725"],[0,"Famous Men of the Middle Ages (#13)"],[1," Charles, then king of the Franks, although his people called him  the Simple, or Senseless, had sense enough to see that this must  be stopped.    So he sent a message to Rollo and proposed that they should have  a talk about peace. Rollo agreed and accordingly they met. The  king and his troops stood on one side of a little river, and Rollo  with his Vikings stood on the other. Messages passed between them.  The king asked Rollo what he wanted.    \"Let me and my people live in the land of the Franks; let us make  ourselves home here, and I and my Vikings will become your vassals,\"  answered Rollo. He asked for Rouen and the neighboring land. So  the king gave him that part of Francia; and ever since it has been  called Normandy, the land of the Northmen.    When it was decided that the Vikings should settle in Francia and  be subjects of the Frankish king, Rollo was told that he must kiss  the foot of Charles in token that he would be the king's vassal.  The haughty Viking refused. \"Never,\" said he, \"will I bend my knee  before any man, and no man's foot will I kiss.\" After some persuasion,  however, he ordered one of his men to perform the act of homage  for him. The king was on horseback and the Norseman, standing by  the side of the horse, suddenly seized the king's foot and drew  it up to his lips. This almost made the king fall from his horse,  to the great amusement of the Norsemen.    Becoming a vassal to the king meant that if the king went to war  Rollo would be obliged to join his army and bring a certain number  of armed men--one thousand or more.    Rollo now granted parts of Normandy to his leading men on condition  that they would bring soldiers to his army and fight under him.  They became his vassals, as he was the king's vassal.    The lands granted to vassals in this way were called feuds, and  this plan of holding lands was called the Feudal System.    It was established in every country of Europe during the Middle  Ages.    The poorest people were called serfs. They were almost slaves and  were never permitted to leave the estate to which they belonged.  They did all the work. They worked chiefly for the landlords, but  partly for themselves.    Having been a robber himself, Rollo knew what a shocking thing it  was to ravage and plunder, and he determined to change his people's  habits. He made strict laws and hanged robbers. His duchy thus  became one of the safest parts of Europe.    The Northmen learned the language of the Franks and adopted their  religion.    The story of Rollo is especially interesting to us, because Rollo  was the forefather of that famous Duke of Normandy who, less than  a hundred and fifty years later, conquered England and brought  into that country the Norman nobles with their French language and  customs.          ALFRED THE GREAT    KING FROM 871-901 A.D.    I    The Danes were neighbors of the Norwegian Vikings, and like them  were fond of the sea and piracy. They plundered the English coasts  for more than a century; and most of northern and eastern England  became for a time a Danish country with Danish kings.    What saved the rest of the country to the Saxons was the courage  of the great Saxon king, Alfred.    Alfred was the son of Ethelwulf, king of the West Saxons. He had  a loving mother who brought him up with great care. Up to the age  of twelve, it is said, he was not able to read well, in spite of  the efforts of his mother and others to teach him.    When Alfred was a boy there were no printed books. The wonderful  art of printing was not invented until about the year 1440--nearly  six hundred years later than Alfred's time. Moreover, the art of  making paper had not yet been invented. Consequently the few books  in use in Alfred's time were written by skillful penmen, who wrote  generally on leaves of parchment, which was sheepskin carefully  prepared so that it might retain ink.    One day Alfred's mother showed him and his elder brothers a beautiful  volume which contained a number of the best Saxon ballads. Some of  the words in this book were written in brightly colored letters,  and upon many of the leaves were painted pictures of gaily-dressed  knights and ladies.    \"Oh, what a lovely book!\" exclaimed the boys.    \"Yes, it is lovely,\" replied the mother. \"I will give it to whichever  of you children can read it the best in a week.\"    Alfred began at once to take lessons in reading, and studied hard  day after day. His brothers passed their time in amusements and  made fun of Alfred's efforts. They thought he could not learn to  read as well as they could, no matter how hard he should try.    At the end of the week the boys read the book to their mother,  one after the other. Much to the surprise of his brothers, Alfred  proved to be the best reader and his mother gave him the book.    While still very young Alfred was sent by his father to Rome to  be anointed by His Holiness, the Pope. It was a long and tiresome  journey, made mostly on horseback.    With imposing, solemn ceremony he was anointed by the Holy Father.  Afterwards he spent a year in Rome receiving religious instruction.    II    In the year 871, when Alfred was twenty-two years old, the Danes  invaded various parts of England. Some great battles were fought,  and Alfred's elder brother Ethelred, king of the West Saxons, was  killed. Thus Alfred became king.    The Danes still continued to fight the Saxons, and defeated Alfred  in a long and severe struggle. They took for themselves the northern  and eastern parts of England.    Moreover, Danes from Denmark continued to cross the sea and ravage  the coast of Saxon England. They kept the people in constant alarm.  Alfred therefore determined to meet the pirates on their own element,  the sea. So he built and equipped the first English navy, and in  875 gained the first naval victory ever won by the English.    A few years after this, however, great numbers of Danes from the  northern part of England came pouring into the Saxon lands. Alfred  himself was obliged to flee for his life.    For many months he wandered through forests and over hills to avoid  being taken by the Danes. He sometimes made his home in caves and  in the huts of shepherds and cowherds. Often he tended the cattle  and sheep and was glad to get a part of the farmer's dinner in  pay for his services.    [Illustration: INVASION OF ENGLAND BY THE DANES]    Once, when very hungry, he went into the house of a cowherd and  asked for something to eat. The cowherd's wife was baking cakes  and she said she would give him some when they were done.    \"Watch the cakes and do not let them burn, while I go across the  field to look after the cows,\" said the woman, as she hurried away.  Alfred took his seat on the chimney-corner to do as he was told.  But soon his thoughts turned to his troubles and he forgot about  the cakes.    When the woman came back she cried out with vexation, for the cakes  were burned and spoiled. \"You lazy, good-for-nothing man!\" she  said, \"I warrant you can eat cakes fast enough; but you are too  lazy to help me bake them.\"    With that she drove the poor hungry Alfred out of her house. In  his ragged dress he certainly did not look like a king, and she  had no idea that he was anything but a poor beggar.    III    Some of Alfred's friends discovered where he was hiding and joined  him. In a little time a body of soldiers came to him and a strong  fort was built by them. From this fort Alfred and his men went  out now and then and gave battle to small parties of the Danes.  Alfred was successful and his army grew larger and larger.    One day he disguised himself as a wandering minstrel and went into  the camp of the Danes. He strolled here and there, playing on a  harp and singing Saxon ballads. At last, Guth'rum, the commander  of the Danes, ordered the minstrel to be brought to his tent.    Alfred went. \"Sing to me some of your charming songs,\" said Guthrum.  \"I never heard more beautiful music.\" So the kingly harper played  and sang for the Dane, and went away with handsome presents. But  better than that, he had gained information that was of the greatest  value.    In a week he attacked the Danish forces and defeated them with  great slaughter in a battle which lasted all day and far into the  night. Guthrum was taken prisoner and brought before Alfred.    Taking his harp in his hands, Alfred played and sang one of the  ballads with which he had entertained Guthrum in the camp. The  Dane started in amazement and exclaimed:    \"You, then, King Alfred, were the wandering minstrel?\"    [Illustration: ALFRED THE GREAT IN DANISH CAMP]    \"Yes,\" replied Alfred, \"I was the musician whom you received so  kindly. Your life is now in my hands; but I will give you your  liberty if you will become a Christian and never again make war  on my people.\"    \"King Alfred,\" said Guthrum, \"I will become a Christian, and so  will all my men if you will grant liberty to them as to me; and  henceforth, we will be your friends.\"    Alfred then released the Danes, and they were baptized as Christians.    An old road running across England from London to Chester was then  agreed upon as the boundary between the Danish and Saxon kingdoms;  and the Danes settled in East Anglia, as the eastern part of England  was called.    Years of peace and prosperity followed for Alfred's kingdom. During  these years the king rebuilt the towns that had been destroyed by  the Danes, erected new forts, and greatly strengthened his army  and navy.    He also encouraged trade; and he founded a school like that established  by Charlemagne. He himself translated a number of Latin books into  Saxon, and probably did more for the cause of education than any  other king that ever wore the English crown.
