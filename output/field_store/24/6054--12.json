This slimy change is due to the growth of  _Streptococcus Hollandicus_.[63]    ~Alcoholic fermentations.~ Although glucose or cane-sugar solutions are  extremely prone to undergo alcoholic fermentation, milk sugar does not  readily undergo this change. Where such changes are produced it is due  to yeasts. Several outbreaks attributable to such a cause have been  reported.[64] Russell and Hastings[65] have found these milk-sugar  splitting yeasts particularly abundant in regions where Swiss cheese is  made, a condition made possible by the use of whey-soaked rennets in  making such cheese.    Kephir and Koumiss are liquors much used in the Orient which are made  from milk that has undergone alcoholic fermentation. Koumiss was  originally made from mare's milk but is now often made from cows' milk  by adding cane sugar and yeast. In addition to the CO_{2} developed,  alcohol, lactic acid, and casein-dissolving ferments are formed. Kephir  is made by adding to milk Kephir grains, which are a mass of yeast and  bacterial cells. The yeasts produce alcohol and CO_{2} while the  bacteria change the casein of milk, rendering it more digestible. These  beverages are frequently recommended to persons who seem to be unable to  digest raw milk readily. The exact nature of the changes produced are  not yet well understood.[66]    ~Bitter milk.~ The presence of bitter substances in milk may be ascribed  to a variety of causes. A number of plants, such as lupines, ragweed and  chicory, possess the property of affecting milk when the same are  consumed by animals. At certain stages in lactation, a bitter salty  taste is occasionally to be noted that is peculiar to individual  animals.    A considerable number of cases of bitter milk have, however, been traced  to bacterial origin. For a number of years the bitter fermentation of  milk was thought to be associated with the butyric fermentation, but  Weigmann[67] showed that the two conditions were not dependent upon each  other. He found that the organism which produced the bitter taste acted  upon the casein.    Conn[68] observed a coccus form in bitter cream that was able to impart  a bitter flavor to milk. Sometimes a bitter condition does not develop  in the milk, but may appear later in the milk products, as in the case  of a micrococcus which Freudenreich[69] found in cheese.    Harrison[70] has traced a common bitter condition in Canadian milk to a  milk-sugar splitting yeast, _Torula amara_ which not only grows rapidly  in milk but produces an undesirable bitterness in cheddar cheese.    Cream ripened at low temperatures not infrequently develops a bitter  flavor, showing that the optimum temperature for this type of  fermentation is below the typical lactic acid change.    Milk that has been heated often develops a bitter condition. The  explanation of this is that the bacteria producing the bitter substances  usually possess endospores, and that while the boiling or sterilizing of  milk easily kills the lactic acid germs, these forms on account of their  greater resisting powers are not destroyed by the heat.    ~Soapy milk:~ A soapy flavor in milk was traced by Weigmann and Zirn[71]  to a specific bacillus, _B. lactis saponacei_, that they found gained  access to the milk in one case from the bedding and in another instance  from hay. A similar outbreak has been reported in this country,[72] due  to a germ acting on the casein and albumen.    ~Red milk.~ The most common trouble of this nature in milk is due to  presence of blood, which is most frequently caused by some wound in the  udder. The ingestion of certain plants as sedges and scouring rushes is  also said to cause a bloody condition; madders impart a reddish tinge  due to coloring matter absorbed. Defects of this class can be readily  distinguished from those due to germ growth because they are apparent at  time of milking. Where blood is actually present, the corpuscles settle  out in a short time if left undisturbed.    There are a number of chromogenic or color-producing bacteria that are  able to grow in milk, but their action is so slow that generally they  are not of much consequence. Moreover their development is usually  confined to the surface of the milk as it stands in a vessel. The most  important is the well-known _B. prodigiosus_. Another form found at  times in milk possessing low acidity[73] is _B. lactis erythrogenes_.  This species only develops the red color in the dark. In the light, it  forms a yellow pigment. Various other organisms have been reported at  different times.[74]    ~Blue milk.~ Blue milk has been known for many years, its communicable  nature being established as long ago as 1838. It appears on the surface  of milk first as isolated particles of bluish or grey color, which  later become confluent, the blue color increasing in intensity as the  acidity increases. The causal organism, _B. cyanogenes_, is very  resistant toward drying,[75] thus accounting for its persistence. In  Mecklenberg an outbreak of this sort once continued for several years.  It has frequently been observed in Europe in the past, but is not now so  often reported. Occasional outbreaks have been reported in this country.    ~Other kinds of colored milk.~ Two or three chromogenic forms producing  still other colors have occasionally been found in milk. Adametz[76]  discovered in a sample of cooked milk a peculiar form (_Bacillus  synxanthus_) that produced a citron-yellow appearance which precipitated  and finally rendered soluble the casein. Adametz, Conn, and List have  described other species that confer tints of yellow on milk. Some of  these are bright lemon, others orange, and some amber in color.    Still other color-producing bacteria, such as those that produce violet  or green changes in the milk, have been observed. In fact, almost any of  the chromogenic bacteria are able to produce their color changes in milk  as it is such an excellent food medium. Under ordinary conditions, these  do not gain access to milk in sufficient numbers so that they modify the  appearance of it except in occasional instances.    ~Treatment of abnormal fermentations.~ If the taint is recognized as of  bacterial origin (see p. 57) and is found in the mixed milk of the herd,  it is necessary to ascertain, first, whether it is a general trouble, or  restricted to one or more animals. This can sometimes be done by  separating the milk of the different cows and noting whether any  abnormal condition develops in the respective samples.    ~Fermentation tests.~ The most satisfactory way to detect the presence of  the taints more often present is to make a fermentation test of one kind  or another. These tests are most frequently used at the factory, to  enable the maker to detect the presence of milk that is likely to prove  unfit for use, especially in cheese making. They are based upon the  principle that if milk is held at a moderately high temperature, the  bacteria will develop rapidly. A number of different methods have been  devised for this purpose. In Walther's lacto-fermentator samples of milk  are simply allowed to stand in bottles or glass jars until they sour.  They are examined at intervals of several hours. If the curdled milk is  homogeneous and has a pure acid smell, the milk is regarded as all  right. If it floats in a turbid serum, is full of gas or ragged holes,  it is abnormal. As generally carried out, no attempt is made to have  these vessels sterile. Gerber's test is a similar test that has been  extensively employed in Switzerland. Sometimes a few drops of rennet are  added to the milk so as to curdle the same, and thus permit of the more  ready detection of the gas that is evolved.    ~Wisconsin curd test.~ The method of testing milk described below was  devised at the Wisconsin Experiment Station in 1895 by Babcock, Russell  and Decker.[77] It was used first in connection with experimental work  on the influence of gas-generating bacteria in cheese making, but its  applicability to the detection of all taints in milk produced by  bacteria makes it a valuable test for abnormal fermentations in general.    In the curd test a small pat of curd is made in a glass jar from each  sample of milk. These tests may be made in any receptacle that has been  cleaned in boiling water, and to keep the temperature more nearly  uniform these jars should be immersed in warm water, as in a wash tub or  some other receptacle. When the milk is about 95 deg. F., about ten drops  of rennet extract are added to each sample and mixed thoroughly with the  milk. The jars should then remain undisturbed until the milk is  completely curdled; then the curd is cut into small pieces with a case  knife and stirred to expel the whey. The whey should be poured off at  frequent intervals until the curd mats. If the sample be kept at blood  heat (98 deg. F.) for six to eight hours, it will be ready to examine.    [Illustration: FIG. 18. Improved bottles for making curd test. _A_, test  bottle complete; _B_, bottle showing construction of cover; _S_, sieve  to hold back the curd when bottle is inverted; _C_, outer cover with _(D  H)_ drain holes to permit of removal of whey.]    More convenient types of this test than the improvised apparatus just  alluded to have been devised by different dairy manufacturers.  Generally, they consist of a special bottle having a full-sized top,  thus permitting the easy removal of the curd. The one shown in Fig. 18  is provided with a sieve of such construction that the bottles will  drain thoroughly if inclined in an inverted position.    ~Interpretation of results of test.~ The curd from a good milk has a firm,  solid texture, and should contain at most only a few small pin holes. It  may have some large, irregular, \"mechanical\" holes where the curd  particles have failed to cement, as is seen in Fig. 19. If gas-producing  bacteria are very prevalent in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27785"],[0,"A Book About Lawyers (#13)"],[1,"young lady was  wooed under circumstances of peculiar difficulty; and she promised to  elope with him if her father refused to receive him as a son-in-law.  Ill-luck befell the scheme; and whilst young Jeffreys was waiting in  the Temple for the letter which should decide his movements, an  intimation reached him that elopement was impossible and union  forbidden. The bearer of this bad news was a young lady--the child of a  poor clergyman--who had been the confidential friend and paid companion  of the squire's daughter.    The case was hard for Jeffreys, cruel for the fair messenger. He had  lost an advantageous match, she had lost her daily bread. Furious with  her for having acted as the _confidante_ of the clandestine lovers, the  squire had turned this poor girl out of his house; and she had come to  London to seek for employment as well as to report the disaster.    Jeffreys saw her overpowered with trouble and shame--penniless in the  great city, and disgraced by expulsion from her patron's roof. Seeing  that her abject plight was the consequence of amiable readiness to serve  him, Jeffreys pitied and consoled her. Most young men would have soothed  their consciences and dried the running tears with a gift of money or a  letter recommending the outcast to a new employer. As she was pretty, a  libertine would have tried to seduce her. In Jeffreys, compassion roused  a still finer sentiment: he loved the poor girl and married her. On May  23, 1667, Sarah Neesham was married to George Jeffreys of the Inner  Temple; and her father, in proof of his complete forgiveness of her  _escapade_, gave her a fortune of L300--a sum which the poor clergyman  could not well afford to bestow on the newly married couple.    Having outlived Sarah Neesham, Jeffreys married again--taking for his  second wife a widow whose father was Sir Thomas Bludworth, ex-Lord Mayor  of London. Whether rumor treated her unjustly it is impossible to say at  this distance of time; but if reliance may be put on many broad stories  current about the lady, her conduct was by no means free from fault. She  was reputed to entertain many lovers. Jeffreys would have created less  scandal if, instead of taking her to his home, he had imitated the pious  Sir Matthew Hale, who married his maid-servant, and on being twitted by  the world with the lowliness of his choice, silenced his censors with a  jest.    Amongst the love affairs of seventeenth-century lawyers place must be  made for mention of the second wife whom Chief Justice Bramston brought  home from Ireland, where she had outlived two husbands (the Bishop of  Clogher and Sir John Brereton), before she gave her hand to the judge  who had loved her in his boyhood. \"When I see her,\" says the Chief  Justice's son, who describes the expedition to Dublin, and the return to  London, \"I confess I wondered at my father's love. She was low, fatt,  red-faced; her dress, too, was a hat and ruff, which tho' she never  changed to death. But my father, I believe, seeing me change  countenance, told me it was not beautie, but virtue, he courted. I  believe she had been handsome in her youth; she had a delicate, fine  hand, white and plump, and indeed proved a good wife and mother-in-law,  too.\" On her journey to Charles I.'s London, this elderly bride, in her  antiquated attire, rode from Holyhead to Beaumaris on a pillion behind  her step-son. \"As she rode over the sandes,\" records her step-son,  \"behind mee, and pulling off her gloves, her wedding ringe fell off, and  sunk instantly. She caused her man to alight; she sate still behind me,  and kept her eye on the place, and directed her man, but he not guessing  well, she leaped off, saying she would not stir without her ringe, it  being the most unfortunate thinge that could befall any one to lose the  wedding-ringe--made the man thrust his hand into the sands (the nature  of which is not to bear any weight but passing), he pulled up sand, but  not the ringe. She made him strip his arme and put it deeper into the  sand, and pulled up the ringe; and this done, he and shee, and all that  stood still, were sunk almost to the knees, but we were all pleased that  the ringe was found.\"    In the legal circle of Charles the Second's London, Lady King was  notable as a virago whose shrill tongue disturbed her husband's peace of  mind by day, and broke his rest at night. Earning a larger income than  any other barrister of his time, he had little leisure for domestic  society; but the few hours which he could have spent with his wife and  children, he usually preferred to spend in a tavern, beyond the reach of  his lady's sharp querulousness. \"All his misfortune,\" says Roger North,  \"lay at home, in perverse consort, who always, after his day-labor done,  entertained him with all the chagrin and peevishness imaginable; so that  he went home as to his prison, or worse; and when the time came, rather  than go home, he chose commonly to get a friend to go and sit in a free  chat at the tavern, over a single bottle, till twelve or one at night,  and then to work again at five in the morning. His fatigue in business,  which, as I said, was more than ordinary to him, and his no comfort, or  rather, discomfort at home, and taking his refreshment by excising his  sleep, soon pulled him down; so that, after a short illness, he died.\"  On his death-bed, however, he forgave the weeping woman, who, more  through physical irritability than wicked design, had caused him so much  undeserved discomfort; and by his last will and testament he made  liberal provision for her wants. Having made his will, \"he said, I am  glad it is done,\" runs the memoir of Sir John King, written by his  father, \"and after took leave of his wife, who was full of tears; seeing  it is the will of God, let us part quietly in friendship, with  submissiveness to his will, as we came together in friendship by His  will.\"          CHAPTER IX.    \"CICERO\" UPON HIS TRIAL.      A complete history of the loves of lawyers would notice many scandalous  intrigues and disreputable alliances, and would comprise a good deal of  literature for which the student would vainly look in the works of our  best authors. From the days of Wolsey, whose amours were notorious, and  whose illegitimate son became Dean of Wells, down to the present time of  brighter though not unimpeachable morality, the domestic lives of our  eminent judges and advocates have too frequently invited satire and  justified regret. In the eighteenth century judges, without any loss of  _caste_ or popular regard, openly maintained establishments that in  these more decorous and actually better days would cover their keepers  with obloquy. Attention could be directed to more than one legal family  in which the descent must be traced through a succession of illegitimate  births. Not only did eminent lawyers live openly with women who were not  their wives, and with children whom the law declined to recognize as  their offspring; but these women and children moved in good society,  apparently indifferent to shame that brought upon them but few  inconveniences. In Great Ormond Street, where a mistress and several  illegitimate children formed his family circle, Lord Thurlow was visited  by bishops and deans; and it is said that in 1806, when Sir James  Mansfield, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, was invited to the  woolsack and the peerage, he was induced to decline the offer more by  consideration for his illegitimate children than by fears for the  stability of the new administration.    Speaking of Lord Thurlow's undisguised intercourse with Mrs. Hervey,  Lord Campbell says, \"When I first knew the profession, it would not  have been endured that any one in a judicial situation should have had  such a domestic establishment as Thurlow's; but a majority of judges had  married their mistresses. The understanding then was that a man elevated  to the bench, if he had a mistress, must either marry her or put her  away. For many years there has been no necessity for such an  alternative.\" Either Lord Campbell had not the keen appetite for  professional gossip, with which he is ordinarily credited, or his  conscience must have pricked him when he wrote, \"For many years there  has been no necessity for such an alternative.\" To show how far his  lordship erred through want of information or defect of candor is not  the duty of this page; but without making any statement that can wound  private feeling, the present writer may observe that 'the  understanding,' to which Lord Campbell draws attention, has affected the  fortune of ladies within the present generation.    That the bright and high-minded Somers was the debauchee that Mrs.  Manley and Mr. Cooksey would have us believe him is incredible. It is  doubtful if Mackey in his 'Sketch of Leading Characters at the English  Court' had sufficient reasons for clouding his sunny picture of the  statesman with the assertion that he was \"something of a libertine.\" But  there are occasions when prudence counsels us to pay attention to  slander.    Having raised himself to the office of Solicitor General, Somers, like  Francis Bacon, found an alderman's daughter to his liking; and having  formed a sincere attachment for her, he made his wishes known to her  father. Miss Anne Bawdon's father was a wealthy merchant, styled Sir  John Bawdon--a man proud of his civic station and riches, and thinking  lightly of lawyers and law. When Somers stated his property and  projects, the rental of his small landed estate and the buoyancy of his  professional income, the opulent knight by no means approved the  prospect offered to his child. The lawyer might die in the course of  twelve months; in which case the Worcestershire estate would be still a  small estate, and the professional income would cease. In twelve mouths  Mr. Solicitor might be proved a scoundrel, for at heart all lawyers were  arrant rogues; in which case"]]]
