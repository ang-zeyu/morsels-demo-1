Its ungainly features of shafts, chimneys, and mounds of debris  are relieved in places by woodlands, an appearance of a hilly country is  presented where the pit mounds have been planted with fir trees. Apart  from its mining aspect, Mons is a city of historic importance. It  contains a Gothic cathedral and town hall of medieval architectural  note. It also, cherishes a special yearly fete of its own on Trinity  Sunday, when in the parade of the Limacon, or snail, the spectacle of  St. George and the Dragon is presented. With great pride the citizens  of Mons showed the British soldiers of occupation an ancient cannon,  claimed to have been used by their forefathers as an ally of the English  at Crecy.    Especially east of Mons, toward Binche, the British line ran through  this district. Several of the greatest European battles have been fought  in its vicinity--Ramilles, Malplaquet, Jemappe, and Ligny.    The night of Saturday, August 22, 1914, passed peacefully for the  British soldiers, still working on their trenches. But distant boom of  guns from the east continued to vibrate to them at intervals. Of its  portend they knew nothing. Doubtless as they plied the shovel they again  speculated over it, wondering and possibly regretting a chance of their  having been deprived of the anticipated battle.    Sunday morning, August 23, 1914, dawned brightly with no sign of the  enemy. In Mons and the surrounding villages the workmen donned their  usual holiday attire, women stood about their doors chatting, children  played in the streets. Church bells rung as usual summoning to public  worship. General French gathered his generals for an early conference.  General Joffre's message on Saturday morning, assured General French of  victory, and positively informed him that Von Kluck was advancing upon  him with no more than one or two army corps. In testimony of it, General  French thus wrote a subsequent official dispatch.    \"From information I received from French headquarters, I understood that  little more than one or at most two of the enemy's army corps, with  perhaps one cavalry division, were in front of my position, and I was  aware of no outflanking movement attempted by the enemy\" (Von Hausen's  advance on the right). \"I was confirmed in this opinion by the fact that  my patrols encountered no undue opposition in their reconnoitering  operations. The observations of my aeroplanes seemed also to bear out  this estimate.\"    To General French, therefore, his position seemed well secured. In the  light of it he awaited Von Kluck's attack with confidence. Toward  mid-day some German aeroplanes swept up above the woods in front, and  circled over the British line. British marksmen at once fired on the  bodies and hawklike wings of the intruders.    Some tense interest was roused among the men as British aeroplanes rose  to encounter the German aircraft. It was the first real battle of the  sky they had witnessed. General French's cavalry patrols now brought  information that the woods were thick with German troops, some of them  deploying eastward toward their right at Binche.    At twenty minutes to one the first shots swept from the woods upon the  British line. Presently, Von Kluck's main attack developed with great  rapidity. The German artillery was brought to the front edge of the  woods to hurl a storm of shells on the British trenches. It was returned  with equal vigor. But very soon it became apparent to British commanders  along the line that the German artillery fire was in far greater volume  than what might be expected from two army corps, whose normal complement  would be some 340 guns. Instead it was estimated 600 German guns were  shortly brought into action.    The battle field was described by the Germans as \"an emptiness.\" The  term is intended to emphasize that the old martial display and pomp has  completely gone. A grand advance upon each other, with trumpets  sounding, banners fluttering, brilliant uniforms, and splendid cavalry  charges, was impossible with long range weapons hailing storms of  bullets and shells of devastating explosive power. Cover was the all  important immediate aim of both attack and defense. In this respect as  we have seen, the German gray-green uniform assisted by rendering them  almost invisible within shelter of such woods as those before Mons. On  the other hand, the brown khaki shade of the British field  uniforms--originally designed for the same purpose on the sandy wastes  of Egypt and Northern India--became conspicuous upon a green background.    As the battle of Mons developed, the British line of the Conde Canal was  swept with German shrapnel. German shells, also, began bursting in the  suburbs of Mons and in the near-by villages. Sir Douglas Haig's right  thus came under strong fire. German aeroplanes assisted by dropping  smoke bombs over the British positions to give the angle of range for  their artillery. Thereupon fights above took place between British and  German airmen, while the armies beneath thundered shot and shell upon  each other. The Germans came on in massed formation of attack. The  British were accustomed to attack in open extended line, and their  shooting from any available cover was generally excellent. They could  not understand the German attack in such close order that they were  mowed down in groups of hundreds.    The German infantry rifle fire, breaking from the shelter of the woods  to encounter a stronger British fire than was anticipated, was at first  ineffective. As to the mass formation they depended upon overwhelming  reserves to take the places of those dead piled in heaps before the  British trenches. It was General Grant's \"food for powder\" plan of  attack repeated.    Thus the battle raged upon the entire length of the British line, with  repeated advances and retreats on the part of the Germans. Now and then  the bodies almost reached the British trenches, and a breach seemed in  certain prospect. But the British sprang upon the invaders, bayonet in  hand, and drove them back to the shelter of the woods. The Irish  regiments, especially, were considered invincible in this \"cold steel\"  method of attack, their national impulsive ardor carrying them in a fury  through the ranks of an enemy. But at Mons always the Germans returned  in ever greater numbers. The artillery increased the terrible rain of  shells. Pen pictures by British soldiers vividly describe the battle  somewhat conflictingly.    \"They were in solid square blocks, standing out sharply against the  skyline, and you couldn't help hitting them. It was like butting your  head against a stone wall.... They crept nearer and nearer, and then our  officers gave the word. A sheet of flame flickered along the line of  trenches and a stream of bullets tore through the advancing mass of  Germans. They seemed to stagger like a drunken man hit between the eyes,  after which they made a run for us.... Halfway across the open another  volley tore through their ranks, and by this time our artillery began  dropping shells around them. Then an officer gave an order and they  broke into open formation, rushing like mad toward the trenches on our  left. Some of our men continued the volley firing, but a few of our  crack shots were told off for independent firing.... They fell back in  confusion, and then lay down wherever cover was available. We gave them  no rest, and soon they were on the move again in flight.... This sort of  thing went on through the whole day.\"    From another view we gather that \"We were in the trenches waiting for  them, but we didn't expect anything like the smashing blow that struck  us. All at once, so it seemed, the sky began to rain down bullets and  shells. At first they went wide ... but after a time ... they got our  range and then they fairly mopped us up.... I saw many a good comrade go  out.\"    During the early part of the battle Von Kluck directed his main attack  upon the British right, with a furious artillery bombardment of Binche  and Bray. This was coincident with the crumpling of the French right at  Charleroi by the army of Von Buelow, and its threatened retreat by that  of Von Hausen. The retirement of the French Fifth Army, therefore, left  General Haig exposed to a strong flank attack by Von Kluck. Confronted  with this danger, General Haig was compelled to withdraw his right to a  rise of ground southward of Bray. This movement left Mons the salient of  an angle between the First and Second British Army Corps. Shortly after  this movement was performed, General Hamilton, in command of Mons, found  himself in peril of converging German front and flank attacks. If the  Germans succeeded in breaking through the British line beyond Mons, he  would be cut off and surrounded. General Hamilton informed his superior,  General French, of this danger, and was advised in return \"to be careful  not to keep the troops in the salient too long, but, if threatened  seriously to draw back the center behind Mons.\"    A little after General French had sent General Hamilton this warning, he  received a telegram from General Joffre which he describes as \"a most  unexpected message.\" General Joffre's telegram conveyed the first news  to General French not only that the French Fifth Army had been defeated  and was in retreat--the first intimation even that the French right at  Charleroi under General Lanrezac was in peril--but that at least three  German army corps were attacking the British. Doubtless the German  smashing of General Joffre's planned grand counterattack, after the  Germans were to be beaten, was disheartening as well as a sore  disappointment.    General French possessed 75,000 men. It was now disclosed that in front  Von Kluck was hurling upon him 200,000 men, Von Buelow was hammering on  his right, Von Hausen in pursuit of the French threatened his rear,  while some 50,000 Germans were enveloping his "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29349"],[0,"Creatures of the Night: A Book of Wild Life in Western Britain (#13)"],[1,"the grassy ledge at the river's brim and peered  into the little bay below. If nothing stirred between the salmon \"hover\"  and the bank, he dropped quietly into the pool, inhaled a long, deep  breath, dived beneath the willow-roots, and watched, through the clear  depths, each moving fish or swaying stem of river-weed within the range  of his vision. But not till, after several visits to his water-entrance,  he was perfectly convinced of the absence of danger, did he dare to  brave the passage of the pool.    The water-entrance to the vole's burrow was situated about a foot below  the summer level of the river, and in a kind of buttress of gravel and  soil, which, at its base, sloped abruptly inwards like an arch. This  buttress jutted out at the lower corner of a little horse-shoe bay; and  hereabouts, during summer, a shoal of minnows had often played,  following each other in and out of every nook and cranny beneath the  bank, or floating up and flashing in sun-flecked ripples faintly stirred  by a breeze that wandered lightly from across the stream.    Ordinarily, Brighteye found that the hole in the perpendicular bank  served its purpose well; at the slightest disturbance he could escape  thither, and, safe from pursuit, climb the irregular stairway to the  hollow chamber above high-water mark. But it was different in times of  flood. If he had to flee from the big trout, or from the otter, when the  stream rushed madly past his open doorway, he found that an interval,  which, however brief, was sufficient to imperil his life, must  necessarily elapse before he could secure a foothold in his doorway and  lift himself into the dark recess beyond.    [Illustration: \"THE BIG TROUT, IN HIS TORPEDO-LIKE RUSH TO CUT OFF  BRIGHTEYE FROM SURE REFUGE.\" (_See_ p. 105).]    Lutra had almost caught him after his adventure with the owl. He had,  however, eluded the otter by diving, in the nick of time, from the stone  to which he clung before the entrance, and then seeking the land. If he  had been an instant later, she would have picked him off, as a bat picks  a moth from a lighted window-pane, and he would never have reached the  down-stream shallow. At that time the water, clearing after a summer  freshet, was fairly low. Brighteye's danger in some wild winter flood  would, therefore, be far greater; so, timorous from his recent  experiences, and sufficiently intelligent to devise and carry out plans  by which he would secure greater safety, he occupied his spare time in  the lengthening nights with driving a second shaft straight inward  from the chamber to a roomy natural hollow among the willow-roots, and  thence in devious course, to avoid embedded stones, downward to a tiny  haven in the angle of the buttress far inside the archway of the bank,  where the space was so confined that the otter could not possibly follow  him. Even the big trout, in his torpedo-like rush to cut off Brighteye  from sure refuge, utterly failed to turn, and then enter the narrow  archway, in time to catch the artful vole.    The task of digging out the second tunnel was exceedingly arduous; yet,  on its completion, Brighteye, taught by the changes going on around him  that months of scarcity were impending, set to work again about half-way  between his sleeping chamber and the upper entrance of the burrow. Here  he scratched out a small, semicircular \"pocket,\" which he filled with  miscellaneous supplies--seeds of many kinds, a few beech-nuts,  hazel-nuts, and acorns, as well as roots of horse-tail grass and fibrous  river-weed.    He was careful, like his small relative the field-vole, and like the  squirrel in the woods above the river-bank, to harvest only ripe,  undamaged seeds and nuts; and in making his choice he was helped by his  exquisite sense of smell. He found some potatoes and carrots--so small  that they had been dropped as worthless by a passing labourer on the  river-path--and selected the best, leaving the others to rot among the  autumn leaves. As the \"pocket\" was inadequate to contain his various  stores, the vole used the chamber also as a granary, and slept in the  warm, dry hollow by the willow-roots.    In the depth of winter, when the mist-wreaths on the stream were icy  cold and brought death to the sleeping birds among the branches of the  leafless alders, and when Lutra, ravenous with hunger, chased the great  grey trout from his \"hover,\" but lost him in a crevice near the stakes,  Brighteye, saved from privation by his hoarded provender, seldom  ventured from his home. But if the night was mild and the stars were not  hidden by a cloud of mist, he would steal along his run-way to the main  road of the riverside people, strip the bark from the willow-stoles, and  feed contentedly on the juicy pith; while his friend, the shrew, busy in  the shallows near the reed-bed, searched for salmon-spawn washed from  the \"redd\" by the turbulent flood, or for newly hatched fry no longer  guarded by the lonely parent fish long since departed on her way to the  distant sea.    The spirit of winter brooded over the river valley. The faint summer  music of the gold-crest in the fir-tops, the sweet, flute-like solo of  the meditative thrush in the darkness of the hawthorn, and the weird,  continuous rattle of the goatsucker perched moveless on an oak-bough  near the river-bend, were no longer heard when at dusk Brighteye left  his burrow and sat, watching and listening, on the little eminence above  the river's brink. Even the drone of the drowsy beetle, swinging over  the ripples of the shadowed stream or from tuft to tuft of grass beside  the woodland path, had ceased. But at times the cheery dipper still sang  from the boulder whence the vole had dived to escape the big brown owl;  and, when other birds had gone to sleep, the robin on the alder-spray  and the wren among the willow-stoles piped their glad vespers to assure  a saddened world that presently the winter's gloom would vanish before  the coming of another spring.    Like a vision of glory, which, in the first hour of some poor wanderer's  sleep, serves but to mock awhile his awakened mind with recollections of  a happy past, so had the Indian summer shone on Nature's tired heart,  and mocked, and passed away. The last red roseleaf had fluttered  silently down; the last purple sloe had fallen from its sapless stem.    A sharp November frost was succeeded by a depressing month of mist and  drizzling rain. Then the heavens opened, and for day after day, and  night after night, their torrents poured down the stony water-courses of  the hills. The river rose beyond the highest mark of summer freshets,  till the low-lying meadow above the village was converted into a lake,  and Brighteye's burrow disappeared beneath the surface of a raging  flood.    Gifted with a mysterious knowledge of Nature's moods--which all wild  animals in some degree possess--the vole had made ready for the sudden  change. On the night preceding the storm, when in the mist even the  faintest sounds seemed to gain in clearness and intensity, he had  hollowed out for himself a temporary dwelling among the roots of a  moss-grown tree on the steep slope of the wood behind the river-path,  and had carried thither all his winter supplies from the granary where  first they had been stored.    Brighteye was exposed to exceptional danger by his compulsory retirement  from the old burrow in the river-bank. Stoats and weasels were ever on  the prowl; no water-entrance afforded him immediate escape from their  relentless hostilities, and he was almost as liable to panic, if pursued  for any considerable distance on land, as were the rabbits living on the  fringe of the gravel-pit within the heart of the silent wood. If a  weasel or a stoat had entered the vole's new burrow during the period  when the flood was at its highest, only the most fortunate circumstances  could have saved its occupant. Even had he managed to flee to the river,  his plight would still have been pitiful. Unable to find security in his  former retreat, and effectually deterred by the lingering scent of his  pursuers from returning to his woodland haunts, Brighteye, a homeless,  hungry little vagabond, at first perplexed, then risking all in search  of food and rest, would inevitably have met his fate.    But neither stoat nor weasel learned of his new abode. His burrow was  high and dry in the gravelly soil under the tree-trunk; and before his  doorway, as far as a hollow at the river's verge, stretched a natural  path of rain-washed stones on which the line of his scent could never  with certainty be followed. While many of his kindred perished,  Brighteye survived this period of flood; and when the waters, having  cleansed each riverside dwelling, abated to their ordinary winter level,  he returned to his burrow in the buttress by the stakes, and once more  felt the joy of living in safety among familiar scenes.    Since the leaves had fallen, the brown rats had become fewer and still  fewer along the river, and, when the flood subsided, it might have been  found that none of these creatures remained in their summer haunts. They  had emigrated to the rick-yard near the village inn; many of the stoats  and weasels, finding provender scarce, had followed in their footsteps;  and Brighteye and his kindred, with the water-shrews, the moorhens, and  the coots, were unmolested in their wanderings both by night and day.    The vole's favourite reed-bed was now seldom visited. Besides being  inundated, it was silted so completely with gravel that to cut through  the submerged stems would have been an arduous and almost impossible  task. Luckily, in his journeys along the edge of the shallows during the  flood, Brighteye had found a sequestered pond, near an old hedgerow  dividing the wood, where tender duckweed was plentiful, and, with  delicious roots of watercress, promised him abundant food. Every evening  he stole through the"]]]
