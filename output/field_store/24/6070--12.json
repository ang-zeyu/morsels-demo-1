I'm to marry the woman I adore, and I've  brought up my child, as I wished, in the old way.\"    He was very fond, in all things, of the \"old way\"; that had struck  Isabel as one of his fine, quiet, sincere notes. \"It occurs to me that  you'll not know whether you've succeeded until you've told her,\" she  said. \"You must see how she takes your news, She may be horrified--she  may be jealous.\"    \"I'm not afraid of that; she's too fond of you on her own account. I  should like to leave her in the dark a little longer--to see if it will  come into her head that if we're not engaged we ought to be.\"    Isabel was impressed by Osmond's artistic, the plastic view, as it  somehow appeared, of Pansy's innocence--her own appreciation of it being  more anxiously moral. She was perhaps not the less pleased when he told  her a few days later that he had communicated the fact to his daughter,  who had made such a pretty little speech--\"Oh, then I shall have a  beautiful sister!\" She was neither surprised nor alarmed; she had not  cried, as he expected.    \"Perhaps she had guessed it,\" said Isabel.    \"Don't say that; I should be disgusted if I believed that. I thought it  would be just a little shock; but the way she took it proves that her  good manners are paramount. That's also what I wished. You shall see for  yourself; to-morrow she shall make you her congratulations in person.\"    The meeting, on the morrow, took place at the Countess Gemini's, whither  Pansy had been conducted by her father, who knew that Isabel was to come  in the afternoon to return a visit made her by the Countess on learning  that they were to become sisters-in-law. Calling at Casa Touchett the  visitor had not found Isabel at home; but after our young woman had been  ushered into the Countess's drawing-room Pansy arrived to say that her  aunt would presently appear. Pansy was spending the day with that lady,  who thought her of an age to begin to learn how to carry herself in  company. It was Isabel's view that the little girl might have given  lessons in deportment to her relative, and nothing could have justified  this conviction more than the manner in which Pansy acquitted herself  while they waited together for the Countess. Her father's decision, the  year before, had finally been to send her back to the convent to receive  the last graces, and Madame Catherine had evidently carried out her  theory that Pansy was to be fitted for the great world.    \"Papa has told me that you've kindly consented to marry him,\" said this  excellent woman's pupil. \"It's very delightful; I think you'll suit very  well.\"    \"You think I shall suit YOU?\"    \"You'll suit me beautifully; but what I mean is that you and papa will  suit each other. You're both so quiet and so serious. You're not so  quiet as he--or even as Madame Merle; but you're more quiet than many  others. He should not for instance have a wife like my aunt. She's  always in motion, in agitation--to-day especially; you'll see when she  comes in. They told us at the convent it was wrong to judge our elders,  but I suppose there's no harm if we judge them favourably. You'll be a  delightful companion for papa.\"    \"For you too, I hope,\" Isabel said.    \"I speak first of him on purpose. I've told you already what I myself  think of you; I liked you from the first. I admire you so much that I  think it will be a good fortune to have you always before me. You'll be  my model; I shall try to imitate you though I'm afraid it will be  very feeble. I'm very glad for papa--he needed something more than  me. Without you I don't see how he could have got it. You'll be my  stepmother, but we mustn't use that word. They're always said to be  cruel; but I don't think you'll ever so much as pinch or even push me.  I'm not afraid at all.\"    \"My good little Pansy,\" said Isabel gently, \"I shall be ever so kind to  you.\" A vague, inconsequent vision of her coming in some odd way to need  it had intervened with the effect of a chill.    \"Very well then, I've nothing to fear,\" the child returned with her  note of prepared promptitude. What teaching she had had, it seemed to  suggest--or what penalties for non-performance she dreaded!    Her description of her aunt had not been incorrect; the Countess Gemini  was further than ever from having folded her wings. She entered the room  with a flutter through the air and kissed Isabel first on the forehead  and then on each cheek as if according to some ancient prescribed rite.  She drew the visitor to a sofa and, looking at her with a variety of  turns of the head, began to talk very much as if, seated brush in hand  before an easel, she were applying a series of considered touches to  a composition of figures already sketched in. \"If you expect me to  congratulate you I must beg you to excuse me. I don't suppose you care  if I do or not; I believe you're supposed not to care--through being so  clever--for all sorts of ordinary things. But I care myself if I tell  fibs; I never tell them unless there's something rather good to be  gained. I don't see what's to be gained with you--especially as you  wouldn't believe me. I don't make professions any more than I make paper  flowers or flouncey lampshades--I don't know how. My lampshades would be  sure to take fire, my roses and my fibs to be larger than life. I'm very  glad for my own sake that you're to marry Osmond; but I won't pretend  I'm glad for yours. You're very brilliant--you know that's the way  you're always spoken of; you're an heiress and very good-looking and  original, not banal; so it's a good thing to have you in the family.  Our family's very good, you know; Osmond will have told you that; and  my mother was rather distinguished--she was called the American Corinne.  But we're dreadfully fallen, I think, and perhaps you'll pick us up.  I've great confidence in you; there are ever so many things I want to  talk to you about. I never congratulate any girl on marrying; I think  they ought to make it somehow not quite so awful a steel trap. I suppose  Pansy oughtn't to hear all this; but that's what she has come to me  for--to acquire the tone of society. There's no harm in her knowing what  horrors she may be in for. When first I got an idea that my brother had  designs on you I thought of writing to you, to recommend you, in the  strongest terms, not to listen to him. Then I thought it would be  disloyal, and I hate anything of that kind. Besides, as I say, I was  enchanted for myself; and after all I'm very selfish. By the way, you  won't respect me, not one little mite, and we shall never be intimate.  I should like it, but you won't. Some day, all the same, we shall be  better friends than you will believe at first. My husband will come and  see you, though, as you probably know, he's on no sort of terms with  Osmond. He's very fond of going to see pretty women, but I'm not afraid  of you. In the first place I don't care what he does. In the second, you  won't care a straw for him; he won't be a bit, at any time, your affair,  and, stupid as he is, he'll see you're not his. Some day, if you can  stand it, I'll tell you all about him. Do you think my niece ought to go  out of the room? Pansy, go and practise a little in my boudoir.\"    \"Let her stay, please,\" said Isabel. \"I would rather hear nothing that  Pansy may not!\"        CHAPTER XXXVI    One afternoon of the autumn of 1876, toward dusk, a young man of  pleasing appearance rang at the door of a small apartment on the third  floor of an old Roman house. On its being opened he enquired for Madame  Merle; whereupon the servant, a neat, plain woman, with a French face  and a lady's maid's manner, ushered him into a diminutive drawing-room  and requested the favour of his name. \"Mr. Edward Rosier,\" said the  young man, who sat down to wait till his hostess should appear.    The reader will perhaps not have forgotten that Mr. Rosier was an  ornament of the American circle in Paris, but it may also be remembered  that he sometimes vanished from its horizon. He had spent a portion of  several winters at Pau, and as he was a gentleman of constituted habits  he might have continued for years to pay his annual visit to this  charming resort. In the summer of 1876, however, an incident befell him  which changed the current not only of his thoughts, but of his customary  sequences. He passed a month in the Upper Engadine and encountered at  Saint Moritz a charming young girl. To this little person he began to  pay, on the spot, particular attention: she struck him as exactly the  household angel he had long been looking for. He was never precipitate,  he was nothing if not discreet, so he forbore for the present to declare  his passion; but it seemed to him when they parted--the young lady to go  down into Italy and her admirer to proceed to Geneva, where he was under  bonds to join other friends--that he should be romantically wretched if  he were not to see her again. The simplest way to do so was to go in  the autumn to Rome, where Miss Osmond was domiciled with her family. Mr.  Rosier started on his pilgrimage to the Italian capital and reached it  on the first of November. It was a pleasant thing to do, but for the  young man there was a strain of the heroic in the enterprise. He might  expose himself, unseasoned, to the poison of the Roman air, which in  November lay, notoriously, much in wait. Fortune, however, favours the  brave; and this adventurer, who took three grains of quinine a day, had  at the end of a month no cause to deplore his temerity. He had made to  a certain extent good use of his time; he had devoted it in vain  to finding a flaw in Pansy Osmond's composition. She was admirably  finished; she had had the last touch; she was really a consummate piece.  He thought of her in amorous meditation a good deal as he might have  thought of a Dresden-china shepherdess. Miss Osmond, indeed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],[0,"Deathworld (#13)"],[1,"like the care you take with your old books,\" Jason said disgustedly.    \"They could have been of no importance,\" Meta said coolly, \"or they  would be filed correctly in the library upstairs.\"    Jason wandered gloomily through the rooms. Nothing remained of any  value. Fragments and scraps of writing and printing. Never enough in one  spot to bother collecting. With the toe of one armored boot, he kicked  angrily at a pile of debris, ready to give up the search. There was a  glint of rusty metal under the dirt.    \"Hold this!\" He gave the light to Meta and began scratching aside the  rubble. A flat metal box with a dial lock built into it, was revealed.    \"Why that's a log box!\" Meta said, surprised.    \"That's what I thought,\" Jason said.    [Illustration]          XI.      Resealing the cellar, they carried the box back to Jason's new office.  Only after spraying with decontaminant, did they examine it closely.  Meta picked out engraved letters on the lid.    \"S. T. POLLUX VICTORY--that must be the name of the spacer this log came  from. But I don't recognize the class, or whatever it is the initials  _S. T._ stand for.\"    \"Stellar Transport,\" Jason told her, as he tried the lock mechanism.  \"I've heard of them but I've never seen one. They were built during the  last wave of galactic expansion. Really nothing more than gigantic metal  containers, put together in space. After they were loaded with people,  machinery and supplies, they would be towed to whatever planetary system  had been chosen. These same tugs and one-shot rockets would brake the  S. T.'s in for a landing. Then leave them there. The hull was a ready  source of metal and the colonists could start right in building their  new world. And they were _big_. All of them held at least fifty thousand  people ...\"    Only after he said it, did he realize the significance of his words.  Meta's deadly stare drove it home. There were now less people on Pyrrus  than had been in the original settlement.    And human population, without rigid birth controls, usually increased  geometrically. Jason dinAlt suddenly remembered Meta's itchy trigger  finger.    \"But we can't be sure how many people were aboard this one,\" he said  hurriedly. \"Or even if this is the log of the ship that settled Pyrrus.  Can you find something to pry this open with? The lock is corroded into  a single lump.\"    Meta took her anger out on the box. Her fingers managed to force a gap  between lid and bottom. She wrenched at it. Rusty metal screeched and  tore. The lid came off in her hands and a heavy book thudded to the  table.    The cover legend destroyed all doubt.        LOG OF S. T. POLLUX VICTORY. OUTWARD BOUND--SETANI TO PYRRUS. 55,000      SETTLERS ABOARD.    Meta couldn't argue now. She stood behind Jason with tight-clenched  fists and read over his shoulder as he turned the brittle, yellowed  pages. He quickly skipped through the opening part that covered the  sailing preparations and trip out. Only when he had reached the actual  landing did he start reading slowly. The impact of the ancient words  leaped out at him.    \"Here it is,\" Jason shouted. \"Proof positive that we're on the right  trail. Even _you_ will have to admit that. Read it, right here.\"        _... Second day since the tugs left, we are completely on our own      now. The settlers still haven't grown used to this planet, though we      have orientation talks every night. As well as the morale agents who      I have working twenty hours a day. I suppose I really can't blame      the people, they all lived in the underways of Setani and I doubt if      they saw the sun once a year. This planet has weather with a      vengeance, worse than anything I've seen on a hundred other planets.      Was I wrong during the original planning stages not to insist on      settlers from one of the agrarian worlds? People who could handle      the outdoors._        _These citified Setanians are afraid to go out in the rain. But of      course they have adapted completely to their native 1.5 gravity so      the two gee here doesn't bother them much. That was the factor that      decided us. Anyway--too late now to do anything about it. Or about      the unending cycle of rain, snow, hail, hurricanes and such. Answer      will be to start the mines going, sell the metals and build      completely enclosed cities._        _The only thing on this forsaken planet that isn't actually against      us are the animals. A few large predators at first, but the guards      made short work of them. The rest of the wild life leaves us alone.      Glad of that! They have been fighting for existence so long that I      have never seen a more deadly looking collection. Even the little      rodents no bigger than a man's hand are armored like tanks ..._    \"I don't believe a word of it,\" Meta broke in. \"That can't be Pyrrus  he's writing about ...\" Her words died away as Jason wordlessly pointed  to the title on the cover.    He continued scanning the pages, flipping them quickly. A sentence  caught his eye and he stopped. Jamming his finger against the place, he  read aloud.    \"'... And troubles keep piling up. First Har Palo with his theory that  the vulcanism is so close to the surface that the ground keeps warm and  the crops grow so well. Even if he is right--what can we do? We must be  self-dependent if we intend to survive. And now this other thing. It  seems that the forest fire drove a lot of new species our way. Animals,  insects and even birds have attacked the people. (Note for Har: check if  possible seasonal migration might explain attacks.) There have been  fourteen deaths from wounds and poisoning. We'll have to enforce the  rules for insect lotion at all times. And I suppose build some kind of  perimeter defense to keep the larger beasts out of the camp.'    \"This is a beginning,\" Jason said. \"At least now we are aware of the  real nature of the battle we're engaged in. It doesn't make Pyrrus any  easier to handle, or make the life forms less dangerous, to know that  they were once better disposed towards mankind. All this does is point  the way. Something took the peaceful life forms, shook them up, and  turned this planet into one big deathtrap for mankind. That _something_  is what I want to uncover.\"          XII.      Further reading of the log produced no new evidence. There was a good  deal more information about the early animal and plant life and how  deadly they were, as well as the first defenses against them.  Interesting historically, but of no use whatsoever in countering the  menace. The captain apparently never thought that life forms were  altering on Pyrrus, believing instead that dangerous beasts were being  discovered. He never lived to change his mind. The last entry in the  log, less than two months after the first attack, was very brief. And  in a different handwriting.        _Captain Kurkowski died today, of poisoning following an insect      bite. His death is greatly mourned._    The \"why\" of the planetary revulsion had yet to be uncovered.    \"Kerk must see this book,\" Jason said. \"He should have some idea of the  progress being made. Can we get transportation--or do we walk to city  hall?\"    \"Walk, of course,\" Meta said.    \"Then you bring the book. At two G's I find it very hard to be a  gentleman and carry the packages.\"    They had just entered Kerk's outer office when a shrill screaming burst  out of the phone-screen. It took Jason a moment to realize that it was a  mechanical signal, not a human voice.    \"What is it?\" he asked.    Kerk burst through the door and headed for the street entrance. Everyone  else in the office was going the same way. Meta looked confused, leaning  towards the door, then looking back at Jason.    \"What does it mean? Can't you tell me?\" He shook her arm.    \"Sector alarm. A major breakthrough of some kind at the perimeter.  Everyone but other perimeter guards has to answer.\"    \"Well, go then,\" he said. \"Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.\"    His words acted like a trigger release. Meta's gun was in her hand and  she was gone before he had finished speaking. Jason sat down wearily in  the deserted office.    The unnatural silence in the building began to get on his nerves. He  shifted his chair over to the phone-screen and switched it on to  _receive_. The screen exploded with color and sound. At first Jason  could make no sense of it at all. Just a confused jumble of faces and  voices. It was a multi-channel set designed for military use. A number  of images were carried on the screen at one time, rows of heads or hazy  backgrounds where the user had left the field of view. Many of the heads  were talking at the same time and the babble of their voices made no  sense whatsoever.    After examining the controls and making a few experiments, Jason began  to understand the operation. Though all stations were on the screen at  all times, their audio channels could be controlled. In that way two,  three or more stations could be hooked together in a link-up. They would  be in round-robin communication with each other, yet never out of  contact with the other stations.    Identification between voice and sound was automatic. Whenever one of  the pictured images spoke, the image would glow red. By trial and error  Jason brought in the audio for the stations he wanted and tried to  follow the course of the attack.    Very quickly he realized this was something out of the ordinary. In some  way, no one made it clear, a section of the perimeter had been broken  through and emergency defenses had to be thrown up to encapsulate it.  Kerk seemed to be in charge, at least he was the only one with an  override transmitter. He used it for general commands. The many, tiny  images faded and his face appeared on top of them, filling the entire  screen.    \"All perimeter stations send twenty-five per cent of your complement to  Area Twelve.\"    The small images"]]]
