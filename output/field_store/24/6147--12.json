That was after the retreat from Mons, the victory  of the Marne, the early battles round Ypres, and the slaughter at Neuve  Chapelle. The \"Old Contemptibles\" were an army of ghosts whose dead  clay was under earth in many fields of France, but whose spirit still  \"carried on\" as an heroic tradition to those who came after them into  those same fields, to the same fate. The only survivors were Regular  officers taken out of the fighting-lines to form the staffs of new  divisions and to train the army of volunteers now being raised at home,  and men who were recovering from wounds or serving behind the lines:  those, and non-commissioned officers who were the best schoolmasters of  the new boys, the best friends and guides of the new officers, stubborn  in their courage, hard and ruthless in their discipline, foul-mouthed  according to their own traditions, until they, too, fell in the  shambles. It was in March of 1915 that a lieutenant-colonel in the  trenches said to me: \"I am one out of 150 Regular officers still serving  with their battalions. That is to say, there are 150 of us left in the  fighting-lines out of 1,500.\"    That little Regular Army of ours had justified its pride in a long  history of fighting courage. It had helped to save England and France by  its own death. Those boys of ours whom I had seen in the first August  of the war, landing at Boulogne and marching, as though to a festival,  toward the enemy, with French girls kissing them and loading them with  fruit and flowers, had proved the quality of their spirit and training.  As riflemen they had stupefied the enemy, brought to a sudden check by  forces they had despised. They held their fire until the German ranks  were within eight hundred yards of them, and then mowed them down as  though by machine-gun fire--before we had machine-guns, except as rare  specimens, here and there. Our horse artillery was beyond any doubt the  best in the world at that time. Even before peace came German generals  paid ungrudging tributes to the efficiency of our Regular Army, writing  down in their histories of war that this was the model of all armies,  the most perfectly trained... It was spent by the spring of '15. Its  memory remains as the last epic of those professional soldiers who,  through centuries of English history, took \"the King's shilling\" and  fought when they were told to fight, and left their bones in far places  of the world and in many fields in Europe, and won for the British  soldier universal fame as a terrible warrior. There will never be a  Regular Army like that. Modern warfare has opened the arena to the  multitude. They may no longer sit in the Coliseum watching the paid  gladiators. If there be war they must take their share of its sacrifice.  They must be victims as well as victors. They must pay for the luxury of  conquest, hatred, and revenge by their own bodies, and for their safety  against aggression by national service.    After the first quick phases of the war this need of national soldiers  to replace the professional forces became clear to the military leaders.  The Territorials who had been raised for home defense were sent out to  fill up the gaps, and their elementary training was shown to be good  enough, as a beginning, in the fighting-lines. The courage of those  Territorial divisions who came out first to France was quickly proved,  and soon put to the supreme test, in which they did not fail. From the  beginning to the end these men, who had made a game of soldiering in  days of peace, yet a serious game to which they had devoted much of  their spare time after working-hours, were splendid beyond all words of  praise, and from the beginning to the end the Territorial officers--men  of good standing in their counties, men of brain and business  training--were handicapped by lack of promotion and treated with  contempt by the High Command, who gave preference always to the Regular  officers in every staff appointment.    This was natural and inevitable in armies controlled by the old Regular  school of service and tradition. As a close corporation in command of  the machine, it was not within their nature or philosophy to make way  for the new type. The Staff College was jealous of its own. Sandhurst  and Woolwich were still the only schools of soldiering recognized  as giving the right \"tone\" to officers and gentlemen fit for high  appointment. The cavalry, above all, held the power of supreme command  in a war of machines and chemistry and national psychology....    I should hate to attack the Regular officer. His caste belonged to the  best of our blood. He was the heir to fine old traditions of courage and  leadership in battle. He was a gentleman whose touch of arrogance was  subject to a rigid code of honor which made him look to the comfort of  his men first, to the health of his horse second, to his own physical  needs last. He had the stern sense of justice of a Roman Centurian, and  his men knew that though he would not spare them punishment if guilty,  he would give them always a fair hearing, with a point in their favor,  if possible. It was in their code to take the greatest risk in time of  danger, to be scornful of death in the face of their men whatever secret  fear they had, and to be proud and jealous of the honor of the regiment.  In action men found them good to follow--better than some of the young  officers of the New Army, who had not the same traditional pride nor  the same instinct for command nor the same consideration for their men,  though more easy-going and human in sympathy.    So I salute in spirit those battalion officers of the Old Army who  fulfilled their heritage until it was overwhelmed by new forces, and  I find extenuating circumstances even in remembrance of the high  stupidities, the narrow imagination, the deep, impregnable, intolerant  ignorance of Staff College men who with their red tape and their general  orders were the inquisitors and torturers of the new armies. Tout  comprendre c'est tout pardonner. They were molded in an old system, and  could not change their cliche.          II      The New Army was called into being by Lord Kitchener and his advisers,  who adopted modern advertising methods to stir the sluggish imagination  of the masses, so that every wall in London and great cities, every  fence in rural places, was placarded with picture-posters.    ... \"What did you do in the Great War, Daddy?\"... \"What will your best  girl say if you're not in khaki?\"    Those were vulgar appeals which, no doubt, stirred many simple souls,  and so were good enough. It would have been better to let the people  know more of the truth of what was happening in France and Flanders--the  truth of tragedy, instead of carefully camouflaged communiques, hiding  the losses, ignoring the deeds of famous regiments, veiling all the  drama of that early fighting by a deliberate screen of mystery, though  all was known to the enemy. It was fear of their own people, not of the  enemy, which guided the rules of censorship then and later.    For some little time the British people did not understand what was  happening. How could they know? It appeared that all was going well.  Then why worry? Soon there would be the joy-bells of peace, and the boys  would come marching home again, as in earlier wars. It was only very  slowly--because of the conspiracy of silence--that there crept into the  consciousness of our people the dim realization of a desperate struggle  ahead, in which all their young manhood would be needed to save France  and Belgium, and--dear God!--England herself. It was as that thought  touched one mind and another that the recruiting offices were crowded  with young men. Some of them offered their bodies because of the promise  of a great adventure--and life had been rather dull in office and  factory and on the farm. Something stirred in their blood--an old call  to youth. Some instinct of a primitive, savage kind, for open-air life,  fighting, killing, the comradeship of hunters, violent emotions, the  chance of death, surged up into the brains of quiet boys, clerks,  mechanics, miners, factory hands. It was the call of the wild--the  hark-back of the mind to the old barbarities of the world's dawn, which  is in the embryo of modern man. The shock of anger at frightful tales  from Belgium--little children with their hands cut off (no evidence for  that one); women foully outraged; civilians shot in cold blood--sent  many men at a quick pace to the recruiting agents. Others were sent  there by the taunt of a girl, or the sneer of a comrade in khaki, or the  straight, steady look in the eyes of a father who said, \"What about it,  Dick?... The old country is up against it.\" It was that last thought  which worked in the brain of England's manhood. That was his real call,  which whispered to men at the plow--quiet, ruminating lads, the peasant  type, the yeoman--and excited undergraduates in their rooms at Oxford  and Cambridge, and the masters of public schools, and all manner of  young men, and some, as I know, old in years but young in heart. \"The  old country is in danger!\" The shadow of a menace was creeping over some  little patch of England--or of Scotland.    \"I's best be going,\" said the village boy.    \"'Dulce et decorum est--'\" said the undergraduate.    \"I hate the idea, but it's got to be done,\" said the city--bred man.    So they disappeared from their familiar haunts--more and more of them  as the months passed. They were put into training-camps, \"pigged\" it on  dirty straw in dirty barns, were ill-fed and ill-equipped, and trained  by hard--mouthed sergeants--tyrants and bullies in a good cause--until  they became automata at the word of command, lost their souls, as it  seemed, in that grinding-machine of military training, and cursed their  fate.

Not ashamed  of their poverty, they made it endurable by moderate desires and  kind dispositions.  One need not look there for master or for  servant; they two were the whole household, master and servant  alike.  When the two heavenly guests crossed the humble  threshold, and bowed their heads to pass under the low door, the  old man placed a seat, on which Baucis, bustling and attentive,  spread a cloth, and begged them to sit down.  Then she raked out  the coals from the ashes, kindled up a fire, and fed it with  leaves and dry bark, and with her scanty breath blew it into a  flame.  She brought out of a corner split sticks and dry  branches, broke them up, and placed them under the small kettle.  Her husband collected some pot-herbs in the garden, and she shred  them from the stalks, and prepared them for the pot He reached  down with a forked stick a flitch of bacon hanging in the  chimney, cut a small piece, and put it in the pot to boil with  the herbs, setting away the rest for another time.  A beechen  bowl was filled with warm water that their guests might wash.  While all was doing they beguiled the time with conversation.    On the bench designed for the guests was laid a cushion stuffed  with sea-weed; and a cloth, only produced on great occasions, but  old and coarse enough, was spread over that.  The old woman, with  her apron on, with trembling hand set the table.  One leg was  shorter than the rest, but a shell put under restored the level.  When fixed, she rubbed the table down with some sweet-smelling  herbs.  Upon it she set some olives, Minerva's-fruit, some  cornel-berries preserved in vinegar, and added radishes and  cheese, with eggs lightly cooked in the ashes.  All were served  in earthen dishes, and an earthenware pitcher, with wooden cups,  stood beside them.  When all was ready, the stew, smoking hot,  was set on the table.  Some wine, not of the oldest, was added;  and for dessert, apples and wild honey; and over and above all,  friendly faces, and simple but hearty welcome.    Now while the repast proceeded, the old folks were astonished to  see that the wine, as fast as it was poured out, renewed itself  in the pitcher, of its own accord.  Struck with terror, Baucis  and Philemon recognized their heavenly guests, fell on their  knees, and with clasped hands implored forgiveness for their poor  entertainment.  There was an old goose, which they kept as the  guardian of their humble cottage; and they bethought them to make  this a sacrifice in honor of their guests.  But the goose, too  nimble for the old folks, eluded their pursuit with the aid of  feet and wings, and at last took shelter between the gods  themselves.  They forbade it to be slain; and spoke in these  words: \"We are gods.  This inhospitable village shall pay the  penalty of its impiety; you alone shall go free from the  chastisement.  Quit your house, and come with us to the top of  yonder hill.\"  They hastened to obey, and staff in hand, labored  up the steep ascent. They had come within an arrow's flight of  the top, when turning their eyes below, they beheld all the  country sunk in a lake, only their own house left standing.  While they gazed with wonder at the sight, and lamented the fate  of their neighbors, that old house of theirs was changed into a  TEMPLE.  Columns took the place of the corner-posts, the thatch  grew yellow and appeared a gilded roof, the floors became marble,  the doors were enriched with carving and ornaments of gold.  Then  spoke Jupiter in benignant accents: \"Excellent old man, and woman  worthy of such a husband, speak, tell us your wishes; what favor  have you to ask of us?\"  Philemon took counsel with Baucis a few  moments; then declared to the gods their united wish.  \"We ask to  be priests and guardians of this your temple; and since here we  have passed our lives in love and concord, we wish that one and  the same hour may take us both from life, that I may not live to  see her grave, nor be laid in my own by her.\"  Their prayer was  granted.  They were the keepers of the temple as long as they  lived.  When grown very old, as they stood one day before the  steps of the sacred edifice, and were telling the story of the  place, Baucis saw Philemon begin to put forth leaves, and old  Philemon saw Baucis changing in like manner.  And now a leafy  crown had grown over their heads, while exchanging parting words,  as long as they could speak.  \"Farewell, dear spouse,\" they said,  together, and at the same moment the bark closed over their  mouths.  The Tyanean shepherd long showed the two trees, standing  side by side, made out of the two good old people.    The story of Baucis and Philemon has been imitated by Swift, in a  burlesque style, the actors in the change being two wandering  saints and the house being changed into a church, of which  Philemon is made the parson The following may serve as a  specimen:--      \"They scarce had spoke when, fair and soft,    The roof began to mount aloft;    Aloft rose every beam and rafter;    The heavy wall climbed slowly after.    The chimney widened and grew higher,    Became a steeple with a spire.    The kettle to the top was hoist,    And there stood fastened to a joist,    But with the upside down, to show    Its inclination for below;    In vain, for a superior force,    Applied at bottom, stops its course;    Doomed ever in suspense to dwell,    'Tis now no kettle, but a bell.    A wooden jack, which had almost    Lost by disuse the art to roast,    A sudden alteration feels,    Increased by new intestine wheels;    And, what exalts the wonder more,    The number made the motion slower;    The flier, though 't had leaden feet,    Turned round so quick you scarce could see 't:    But slackened by some secret power,    Now hardly moves an inch an hour.    The jack and chimney, near allied,    Had never left each other's side.    The chimney to a steeple grown,    The jack would not be left alone;    But up against the steeple reared,    Became a clock, and still adhered;    And still its love to household cares    By a shrill voice at noon declares.    Warning the cook-maid not to burn    That roast meat which it cannot turn.    The groaning chair began to crawl,    Like a huge snail, along the wall;    There stuck aloft in public view,    And, with small change, a pulpit grew.    A bedstead of the antique mode,    Compact of timber many a load,    Such as our ancestors did use,    Was metamorphosed into pews,    Which still their ancient nature keep    By lodging folks disposed to sleep.\"      PROSERPINE    Under the island of Aetna lies Typhoeus the Titan, in punishment  for his share in the rebellion of the giants against Jupiter.  Two mountains press down   the one his right and the other his  left hand   while Aetna lies over his head.  As Typhoeus moves,  the earth shakes; as he breathes, smoke and ashes come up from  Aetna.  Pluto is terrified at the rocking of the earth, and fears  that his kingdom will be laid open to the light of day.  He  mounts his chariot with the four black horses and comes up to  earth and looks around.  While he is thus engaged, Venus, sitting  on Mount Eryx playing with her boy Cupid, sees him and says: \"My  son, take your darts with which you conquer all, even Jove  himself, and send one into the breast of yonder dark monarch, who  rules the realm of Tartarus.  Why should he alone escape?  Seize  the opportunity to extend your empire and mine.  Do you not see  that even in heaven some despise our power?  Minerva the wise,  and Diana the huntress, defy us; and there is that daughter of  Ceres, who threatens to follow their example.  Now do you, if you  have any regard for your own interest or mine, join these two in  one.\"  The boy unbound his quiver, and selected his sharpest and  truest arrow; then, straining the bow against his knee, he  attached the string, and, having made ready, shot the arrow with  its barbed point right into the heart of Pluto.    In the vale of Enna there is a lake embowered in woods, which  screen it from the fervid rays of the sun, while the moist ground  is covered with flowers, and spring reigns perpetual.  Here  Proserpine was playing with her companions, gathering lilies and  violets, and filling her basket and her apron with them, when  Pluto saw her from his chariot, loved her, and carried her off.  She screamed for help to her mother and her companions; and when  in her fright she dropped the corners of her apron and let the  flowers fall, childlike, she felt the loss of them as an addition  to her grief.  The ravisher urged on his steeds, calling them  each by name, and throwing loose over their heads and necks his  iron-colored reins.  When he reached the River Cyane, and it  opposed his passage, he struck the river bank with his trident,  and the earth opened and gave him a passage to Tartarus.    Ceres sought her daughter all the world over.  Bright-haired  Aurora, when she came forth in the morning, and Hesperus, when he  led out the stars in the evening, found her still busy in the  search.  But it was all unavailing.  At length, weary and sad,  she sat down upon a stone and continued sitting nine days and  nights, in the open air, under the sunlight and moonlight and  falling showers.  It was where now stands the city of Eleusis,  then the home of an old man named Celeus.  He was out in the  field, gathering acorns and blackberries, and sticks for his  fire.  His little girl was driving home their two goats, and as  she passed the goddess, who appeared in the guise of an old  woman, she said to her, \"Mother,\" and the name was sweet to the  ears of Ceres, \"why do you sit here alone upon the rocks?\"  The  old man also stopped, though his load was heavy, and begged her  to come into his cottage, such as it was.  She declined, and he  urged her.  \"Go in peace,\" she replied, \"and be happy in your  daughter; I have lost mine.\"  As she spoke,"]]]
