Approximately the same potency was  determined for cottonmouths. Several rattlesnakes that he tested showed  a higher toxicity than copperheads or cottonmouths.    Criley (1956:378) found the venom of copperheads to be 6.95, nearer  Minton's earlier estimate, and rated cottonmouth venom as being twice as  toxic as that of copperheads. The relative toxicities of other crotalids  tested, considering the cottonmouth to be one unit, were: _C.  basiliscus_, 0.3; _A. contortrix_, 0.5; _C. viridis oreganus_, 1.4; _A.  bilineatus_, 2.2; _C. adamanteus_, 2.3; _C. v. viridis_, 3.2; _C.  durissus terrificus_, 27.5.    It can be seen from the above examples that toxicity of venoms and the  resistance of the animal receiving an injection of venom is highly  variable. Possibly the venom of each species of snake has greatest  effect on animals of the particular group relied on for food by the  snake. If that is so, the venom of cottonmouths would be expected to be  more toxic when tested on fish, reptiles, and amphibians than on birds  and mammals. Likewise, the venom of most species of rattlesnakes would  be expected to be more virulent when injected into mammals than when  injected into lower vertebrates. But, according to Netting (1929:108),  species of rattlesnakes that prey on cold-blooded animals, which are  less susceptible to venoms than warm-blooded animals, are thought to  have highly toxic venoms. This explanation accounts for the powerful  venom of _Sistrurus catenatus_; and, in this respect, venom of  cottonmouths should be highly toxic also. However, no clear-cut trends  have been shown in most cases. Allen (1937) injected 250-gram guinea  pigs with 4 milligrams of venom of various poisonous snakes. Survival  time was recorded in order to indicate the relative potency of the  venoms. Of 16 such tests _C. adamanteus_ held places 1, 2, 3, 12, and  16; _Bothrops atrox_ held places 4, 9, 10, and 13; and _A. piscivorus_  held places 5, 7, 8, and 15. Places 6, 11, and 14 were held by three  individuals of different species. No relationship to size or sex was  indicated by the results of this experiment.      Susceptibility of Snakes    Numerous experiments have been conducted to determine the susceptibility  of various snakes to venom. The majority of these experiments were  performed to learn whether or not venomous snakes were immune to their  own poison. Conant (1934:382) reported on a 30-inch cottonmouth that  killed two Pacific rattlesnakes and another cottonmouth. One rattlesnake  was bitten on the tail and the other on or near the head and partially  swallowed. Gloyd (1933:13-14) recorded fatal effects to a rattlesnake  from the bite of a cottonmouth. He also reported on the observations of  three other crotalids bitten by themselves or other snakes, from which  no harmful effects were observed. Allen (1937) injected several snakes  with dried cottonmouth venom which was diluted with distilled water just  before each injection. Four cottonmouths receiving 9, 18, 19, and 20  milligrams of venom per ounce of body weight survived, while another  receiving 18.7 milligrams per ounce died after three hours. A specimen  of _S. miliarius_ receiving 8.3 milligrams per ounce died in about ten  hours, while a _C. durissus_ receiving 12.5 milligrams per ounce  succumbed in 45 minutes. An alligator receiving 6 milligrams per ounce  died in 14 hours. Even the snakes that survived showed some degree of  swelling.    The studies of Keegan and Andrews (1942:252) show that king-snakes are  sometimes killed by poisonous snakes. A _Lampropeltis calligaster_  injected with _A. contortrix_ venom (0.767 milligrams per gram) died  five days following the injection. This amount was more than twice the  amount of _A. piscivorus_ venom injected into a _L. getulus_ by Allen  (1937) in which the snake showed no ill effects. Keegan and Andrews  (_loc. cit._) stated that success in overpowering and eating poisonous  snakes by _Lampropeltis_ and _Drymarchon_ may be due to the ability to  avoid bites rather than to immunity to the venom. However, Rosenfeld and  Glass (1940) demonstrated that the plasma of _L. g. getulus_ had an  inhibiting effect on the hemorrhagic action on mice of the venoms of  several vipers.    One of the more extensive studies on effects of venoms on snakes is that  by Swanson (1946:242-249). In his studies freshly extracted liquid venom  was used. His studies indicated that snakes are not immune to venom of  their own kind or to closely related species. Copperhead venom killed  copperheads faster than did other venoms but took more time to kill  massasaugas, cottonmouths, and timber rattlers. However, most of the  snakes were able to survive normal or average doses of venom although  they are not necessarily immune to it.    One of the major problems in comparing the data on toxicity of venom in  studies of this type is that no standard method of estimating toxicity  has been used. Swanson's (_loc. cit._) amount of venom equalling one  minim (M.L.D.?) ranged from 0.058 to 0.065 cubic centimeters. There were  no different values given for each species, but the time that elapsed  from injection of the venom to death represented the toxicity. There  also was no attempt in his study to convert the amount of venom used  into a ratio of the volume of venom per weight of snake, making the  results somewhat difficult to interpret. Additional work in this field  should provide for many injections into many individuals of several size  classes. The studies to date have been on far too few individuals to  allow statistical analyses to be accurate.          THE BITE    Effects of the Bite      Factors determining the outcome of snakebite are: size, health, and  species of snake; individual variation of venom toxicity of the species;  age and size of the victim; allergic or immune responses; location of  the bite; and the amount of venom injected and the depth to which it is  injected. The last factor is one of the most variable, owing to (1)  character and thickness of clothing between the snake and the victim's  skin, (2) accuracy of the snake's strike, and (3) size of the snake,  since a large snake can deliver more venom and at a greater depth than  can a small snake.    Pope and Perkins (1944) demonstrated that pit-vipers of the United  States bite as effectively as most innocuous snakes and that a careful  study of the bite may reveal the location of the pocket of venom, size  of the snake, and possibly its generic identity (see Dentition). The  bite pattern of the cottonmouth as well as the other crotalids showed  the typical fang punctures plus punctures of teeth on both the pterygoid  and mandible. Even so, a varying picture may be presented because from  one to four fang marks may be present. At times in the fang-shedding  cycle three and even four fangs can be in operation simultaneously.    Various authors have attributed death of the prey to the following  causes: paralysis of the central nervous system, paralysis of the  respiratory center, asphyxiation from clotting of the blood, stoppage of  the heart, urine suppression due to crystallized hemoglobin in the  kidney tubules, dehydration of the body following edema in the area of  the bite, or tissue damage. Mouths of snakes are reservoirs for  infectious bacteria, which are especially prolific in damaged tissue.  Bacterial growth is aided by the venom which blocks the bactericidal  power of the blood.    Three grades in the severity of snakebite (I, minimal; II, moderate; and  III, severe) were described by Wood, Hoback, and Green (1955). Parrish  (1959:396) added a zero classification to describe the bite of a  poisonous snake in which no envenomation occurred. Grade IV (very  severe) was added by McCollough and Gennaro (1963:961) to account for  many bites of the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes.    The first symptom of poisonous snakebite is an immediate burning  sensation at the site of the bite. Within a few minutes the loss of  blood into the tissues causes discoloration. Swelling proceeds rapidly  and can become so great as to rupture the skin. Pain is soon felt in the  lymph ducts and glands. Weakness, nausea, and vomiting may ensue at a  relatively early stage. Loss of blood into tissues may spread to the  internal organs. In conjunction with a rapid pulse, the blood pressure  and body temperature can drop. Some difficulty in breathing can occur,  especially if large amounts of neurotoxin are present in the venom. In  severe cases the tension due to edema obstructs venous and even arterial  flow, in which case bacteria may multiply rapidly in the necrotic tissue  and gangrene can occur. Blindness due to retinal hemorrhages may occur.  Symptoms of shock may be present after any bite.      Treatment    Perhaps one of the most important factors in the outcome of snakebite is  the treatment. Because of the variable reactions to snakebite, treatment  should vary accordingly. Many methods have been proposed for treating  snakebite, and there is disagreement as to which is the best. The list  of remedies that have been used in cases of snakebite includes many that  add additional injury or that possibly increase the action of the venom.  The use of poultices made by splitting open living chickens and the use  of alcohol, potassium permanganate, strychnine, caffeine, or injection  of ammonia have no known therapeutic value, and may cause serious  complications. The most important steps in the treatment of snakebite  are to prevent the spread of lethal doses of venom, to remove as much  venom as possible, and to neutralize the venom as quickly as possible.    It is generally agreed that the first step in snakebite treatment should  be to place a ligature above the bite to restrict the flow of venom, and  also to immobilize the patient as much as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38315"],[0,"Artistic Anatomy of Animals (#13)"],[1,". In the cat, the anterior  outline of the scapula, formed by the union of the cervical border and  the corresponding half of the spinal, is more convex; the posterior  angle is not obtuse, as in the dog. The spine is bent slightly downwards  and backwards; before terminating in the acromion process it presents a  triangular projection, the apex of which is directed downwards. The  tubercle which represents the coracoid process is curved inwards more  strongly than that of the dog, thus resembling more closely the  appearance of this process in the human being.    All proportions considered, the scapula of the cat is broader than that  of the dog; its width, measured along the length of its spinal border  (from A to A', Fig. 36), equals three-fourths of the length of the  spine.    The clavicle is rudimentary; it is, however, better developed in the cat  than in the dog. The clavicle of the cat is represented by a small,  elongated bone, curved in outline, the convexity being turned forward;  it is united to the acromion and the sternum by ligamentous fibres; that  of the dog is merely a scale-like osseous plate situated on the  posterior surface of a muscle of this region (see Figs. 16 and 17).    The humerus is long and twisted in the shape of an S. The inferior  articular surface has the form of a simple pulley, for the condyle is  very slightly marked. The internal part of this articular surface  descends lower than the external; this condition resembles that found in  the human being, where the inner lip of the trochlea is lower than the  condyle.    In the dog, the olecranon fossa communicates with the coronoid by an  opening.    In the cat, there is a supra-epitrochlear canal (see Fig. 19), but no  olecranon perforation.    The bones of the forearm articulate at their extremities. The body of  the radius is united to the body of the ulna by a short, thick,  interosseous ligament; the fibres of this ligament, though short, do not  prevent the production of some movements at the articulations of the  bones.    The radius so crosses the ulna that above, it is in front and external  to the latter, while below, it is internal. This bone is flattened from  front to back, and slightly convex anteriorly. Its superior extremity is  formed, externally, of a portion which represents the head of the radius  in man; internally, by another portion which represents half of the  coronoid process of the ulna, which, in the human being, belongs  exclusively to the latter (see p. 39, the encroachment of the radius on  the ulna). This extremity is surrounded with a vertical articular  surface which is placed in contact with a small cavity which is hollowed  out on the ulna (the lesser sigmoid cavity); and presents at its  superior aspect a surface which articulates with the inferior extremity  of the humerus. The shaft of the bone has on its internal border  rugosities analogous to the imprint of the pronator radii teres of the  human skeleton; these rugosities, indeed, give insertion to a muscle of  the same function, and bearing the same name. The inferior extremity,  broader than the superior, is hollowed on its external aspect by a small  cavity which receives the inferior extremity of the ulna; its inferior  surface (concave) articulates with the carpus; its anterior surface (the  homologue of the posterior surface of the corresponding extremity of the  human radius) presents grooves which serve for the passage of the  tendons of the muscles which pass from the forearm to the back of the  hand. (For the names of the muscles whose tendons pass in these grooves,  see Fig. 29.)    The ulna is furnished at its superior extremity with an olecranon  process, which is more prominent than that of the human ulna; this  process is compressed laterally, and its internal surface is hollowed;  there we also find a great sigmoid cavity, and a coronoid process  situated at the internal part of the anterior surface, a process which,  as we have previously shown, it shares with the radius.    The shaft of the bone, prismatic and triangular, diminishes in thickness  as it approaches the lower extremity, which articulates with the  corresponding extremity of the radius. In the dog, the ulna terminates  inferiorly in a blunt point, without enlargement, analogous to the head  of the human ulna; in the cat, by a head which is prolonged into a  styloid process, by which it articulates with a portion of the carpus.    The carpus consists of seven bones--three in the superior row and four  in the inferior. In the superior row the scaphoid and semilunar bones  are fused together. The pisiform is elongated and expanded at its two  extremities; it forms a prominence which, directed backwards, projects  beyond the level of the other bones of this region.    The metacarpal bones are five in number; they are enumerated from within  outwards; they articulate with the carpus and with each other. The  inferior extremity of each metacarpal bone presents the form of a  condyle in front; and is divided behind so as to form two lateral  condyles, which are separated by a median crest; on these posterior  condyles are applied two small sesamoid bones. The metacarpal bone of  the thumb is very short; the third and fourth are the longest. The  metacarpus, as a whole, is directed vertically.    The phalanges are three in number for each finger, except the thumb,  which has but two. The first phalanx, directed almost horizontally  forwards, is the longest; the second is directed downwards and forwards;  the third consists of two portions: a posterior part, which forms a sort  of sheath into which the base of the nail is received; and an anterior,  conical in form, and curved in crochet shape, which forms a support for  the nail (Fig. 37).    The third and fourth digits are the longest; the second and fifth are of  equal length; the thumb is the shortest; it does not touch the ground,  and does not even reach the articulation of the metacarpal bone and  first phalanx of the second finger.    In the cat, the metacarpal bone of the thumb, although shorter than any  of the others, is quite as thick. The third digit is a little longer  than either the second or fourth. In animals of this genus, the claws,  in the condition of repose, are retracted, and removed from the ground;  this prevents their being worn, and thus preserves their sharpness. At  such times the third phalanx is received into a groove which is found on  the external surface of the second phalanx. In the dog, the claws are  not tractile.    [Illustration: FIG. 37.--SKELETON OF THE FINGER OF A FELIDE (LION): LEFT  SIDE, INTERNAL SURFACE.    1, Metacarpus; 2, sesamoid bones; 3, first phalanx; 4, second phalanx;  5, third phalanx; 6, gutter for the reception of the base of the nail;  7, prominent osseous crest formed to lodge in the concavity of the  nail.]    [Illustration: FIG. 38.--SKELETON OF THE PIG: LEFT LATERAL SURFACE.    1, Cranium; 2, face; 3, atlas; 4, axis; 5, seventh cervical vertebra; 6,  first dorsal vertebra; 7, fourteenth and last dorsal vertebra; 8, lumbar  vertebrae; 9, sacrum; 10, coccygeal vertebrae; 11, anterior extremity of  the sternum; 12, xiphoid appendix; 13, seventh and last sternal rib; 14,  costal cartilage; 15, cartilage of prolongation of the scapula; 16,  great tuberosity of the humerus; 17, olecranon process; 18, radius; 19,  ulna; 20, pisiform; 21, metacarpus; 22, phalanges of the two great toes;  23, phalanges of the external toe; 24, ilium; 25, pubis; 26, tuberosity  of the ischium; 27, great trochanter; 28, knee-cap; 29, anterior  tuberosity of the tibia; 30, fibula; 31, tarsus; 32, calcaneum; 33,  metatarsus; 34, phalanges of the two great toes; 35, phalanges of the  external toe.]    =Unguligrades=: =Pig= (Fig. 38).--The scapula is markedly narrowed in  the region above the glenoid cavity. The spine is atrophied at both its  extremities, so that at its inferior part we do not find the acromion  process. In its middle portion the spine is prominent, and presents a  triangular process which turns backwards, overlapping a part of the  infraspinous fossa; this latter is much larger than the supraspinous.  The spinal border is surmounted by the cartilage of prolongation, the  superior margin of which is convex; this cartilage extends posteriorly  beyond the posterior (axillary) border of the bone.    The small tuberosity of the superior extremity of the humerus is but  slightly developed; the great tuberosity, on the contrary, is very  large. The bicipital groove is situated internal to this. The deltoid  impression is scarcely marked.    The forearm is short, directed obliquely downwards and inwards, thus  forming with the hand an angle, of which the apex is directed inwards.  The two bones of the forearm are strongly bound to one another by an  interosseous ligament, which is formed of very short fibres. The radius  appropriates, at its superior extremity, the coronoid process of the  ulna. The latter is, notwithstanding, well developed in the rest of its  extent; it has a flattened shaft which almost completely overlaps the  posterior surface of the radius; its inferior extremity reaches to the  carpus.    The carpus is formed of eight bones--four in the superior row, and four  in the inferior. The third bone of the superior row (cuneiform) is more  in contact with the ulna than with the radius.    There are but four metacarpal bones; there is no metacarpal of the  thumb. The two median metacarpal bones are the longest; they are those  which correspond to the digits which alone touch the ground. The  internal digit and the external one are thin and short; they are  functionless, as a rule, taking no part in supporting the limbs on the  ground. Notwithstanding this, they are formed, as the other digits, of a  number of phalanges, which give them the semblance of perfect digits.
