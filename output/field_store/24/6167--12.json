[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34376"],[0,"Our Domestic Birds: Elementary Lessons in Aviculture (#13)"],[1," Dwarfs  occur and undoubtedly have occurred frequently in every race of fowls.  Usually they are unsymmetrical and weakly, and are called runts and put  out of the way as soon as possible. But occasionally an undersized  individual is finely formed, active, and hardy. By mating such a  specimen with the smallest specimen of the other sex that can be found  (even though the latter is much larger), and by repeated selection of  the smallest specimens, a dwarf race may be obtained. It could be made,  though not so rapidly, by systematic selection of the smallest ordinary  specimens and by keeping the growing chicks so short of food that they  would be stunted. The latter process, however, is so tedious that no one  is likely to adopt it. Usually the idea of making a new variety of  bantams does not occur to a breeder until he sees a good dwarf specimen  of a race of which there is no dwarf variety. Then, if he undertakes to  make such a variety, he is likely to use in the process both small  specimens of large races and birds of long-established dwarf races.    [Illustration: Fig. 61.

Dwarf types of most of the popular breeds have been made here and  exhibited, but the originators were given very little encouragement to  perfect them.    [Illustration: Fig. 65.

Only the  self-colored varieties--buff, black, and white--are natives of China.  The Partridge variety was made in England, where there are several other  color varieties not known in this country. The Common Game Bantam is a  dwarf Pit Game fowl; the Exhibition Game Bantam is a dwarf type  resembling the Exhibition Game, developed from the Common Game Bantam.  Rose-Comb Black and Rose-Comb White Bantams are diminutive Hamburg  fowls; Polish Bantams are diminutive Polish. The Sebright Bantams are of  the same general type as the Rose-Combs, but in color they are laced  like the large varieties of Polish, not spangled like the party-colored  Hamburgs. They are further distinguished by being \"hen-tailed,\" that is,  the males having tails like hens. Sebright Bantams were made in England  about a hundred years ago, by Sir John Sebright, for whom they were  named. Although the large Brahmas and Cochins are originally of the same  stock, no bantams of the colors of the Brahmas have come from China. The  Light and Dark Brahma Bantams were made in England and America in very  recent times. From Japan has come a peculiar type of bantam with very  short legs, a large tail carried very high, and a large single comb. In  their native country the Japanese Bantams are not separated into  distinct color varieties. In England and America there are black, white,  gray, black-tailed white, and buff varieties.          CHAPTER V    MANAGEMENT OF FOWLS      The methods of managing fowls vary according to the conditions under  which they are kept and the time that the keeper can give them. Fowls  ought to have an outdoor run, and it is desirable that this should be  large enough to be kept in sod; but very few people in towns can give  their fowls grass yards, and the advantages of an outdoor run will not  in themselves compensate for neglect in other matters. Hence we often  see fowls under poor conditions, with good care, doing better than  fowls, in a much more favorable environment, that are given indifferent  care. No absolute rules for keeping fowls under any given conditions can  be made. In general, small flocks of fowls that have free range or  large, grassy yards need very little attention, while those that are  closely confined require a great deal.    With good care the egg production of fowls in close confinement is often  better than that from fowls at liberty, but if the cost of caring for  the fowls is computed at current rates for common labor, the rate of  compensation is often higher on fowls running at large than on fowls in  confinement which are producing many more eggs. The question of profits  from amateur poultry keeping, however, should not be considered solely  with reference to the compensation for time used, nor should such work  be adjusted wholly with reference to economic results, for it combines  recreation, education, and money compensation, and the first two results  should have as much consideration as the last.    In this chapter the methods adapted to small flocks are first described  for the instruction of the pupil, and then descriptions of operations on  a larger scale are given for his information.      SMALL FLOCKS ON TOWN LOTS    =Numbers in flocks.= The average number of fowls kept by a town family  for its own use is about one dozen. Very few who keep hens have less  than half a dozen, and not many who plan only to supply their own tables  have more than a dozen and a half. Six fowls, if well cared for, will  produce all the eggs used by an average family of two or three persons  during the greater part of the year.    =Houses and yards.= For a dozen medium-sized fowls the house should be  about 8 ft. x 8 ft. on the ground, with the highest point of the roof  about 6 or 7 feet from the floor. The general rule is to make the  poultry house face the sun, and have the windows and the outside doors  in or near the front. The object of this is to get as much sunlight in  the house as possible in winter, when the sun is low, and to have the  walls tight that are exposed to the prevailing cold winds. In the  Northern Hemisphere the front of the house is toward the south; in the  Southern Hemisphere it is toward the north. In tropical and subtropical  countries houses are often so constructed that they can be kept open on  all sides in summer and closed tightly, except in front, during cool  weather.    [Illustration: Fig. 69. Small house used for fowls and pigeons]    If the land on which a house stands is sandy and well drained, the floor  may be of earth. The common practice where earth floors are used is to  fill the earth level with the top of the sill and renew it once a year  by removing the soil that has become mixed with droppings of the fowls  and putting in fresh earth. When a house stands on wet land or on clay  soil, it is better to have a floor of boards or of cement.    Fowls may be confined to a house for a year or more and lay well and be  in apparently good condition at the end of such a period, but as the  chickens hatched from the eggs of fowls that have been so closely  confined for even a few months are almost invariably less vigorous than  those produced from fowls that live a more natural life, this plan is  not much used except by those who keep a few fowls for their eggs only  and renew the stock by purchase as often as necessary.    [Illustration: Fig. 70. An old-style small poultry house and yard]    To give a flock of a dozen fowls outdoor air and exercise enough to keep  them in good condition, a yard containing about 300 sq. ft. is  necessary. There is no perceptible advantage in giving more yard room  than this, unless the yard can be made so large that grass will grow  continuously in the greater part of it. On most soils this would  require a yard containing from 750 to 1000 sq. ft. in sod before being  used for poultry.    [Illustration: Fig. 71. Coop and shade for flock of Bantams[9]]    [9] The coop is an old dry-goods box; the shade is a burlap bag.  Makeshift arrangements are not always nice looking, but some of the  finest chickens are kept in very poor quarters.    When fowls are confined to their houses, or to the houses and small  yards, the droppings must be removed at frequent, regular intervals. To  facilitate this it is customary to have a wide board, called the  droppings board, under the roost at a distance of eight or ten inches.  All the droppings made while the birds are on the roost fall on this  board and are easily collected and removed. It is a good plan to keep a  supply of dry earth in a convenient place, and strew a little of this  over the droppings board after each cleaning. Sifted coal ashes, land  plaster, and dry sawdust are sometimes used instead of earth on the  droppings boards. The droppings of fowls, when not mixed with other  matter, are often salable for use in tanning leather, but in most cases  the difference in their value for this purpose and for use as plant  fertilizer is not great enough to pay for the extra trouble which is  made by saving them for the tanners. Poultry manure is one of the most  valuable fertilizers and can always be used to good advantage on lawns  and gardens.    [Illustration: Fig. 72. Neat house for six hens]    If the floor is of wood or of cement, a thin layer of earth or sand  spread upon it makes it more comfortable for the fowls. On all kinds of  floors the modern practice is to use a few inches of litter of some  kind. There is a great variety of materials that will serve this  purpose. Lawn clippings raked up after they are dry, dried weeds and  grass from the garden, leaves collected when dry and stored to be used  as wanted, straw, hay, cornstalks cut into short lengths, and shavings,  such as are sold baled for bedding horses and cattle, are all good.  Fresh litter should be added in small quantities about once a week."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34479"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 1 (of 6) (#13)"],[1,"the art of  working in mosaic; a piece wrought by him in the Navicella, or ship of  St. Peter, may be seen in the portico of that cathedral; but it has been  so much repaired, that now the design is wholly different, and appears  the work of another artist. It is believed that the art of miniature  painting, so much prized in that age for the ornamenting of missals,  received great improvement from him.[49] Architecture undoubtedly did;  the admirable belfry of the cathedral of Florence is the work of Giotto.    After collecting all the notices he could of the scholars of Cimabue and  Giotto, Baldinucci endeavours to make us believe that all the benefits  which accrued to painting, sculpture, and architecture in Italy, and  even throughout the world, came directly or indirectly from Florence.  The following is the manner in which he expresses himself in his first  pages, with the proofs which he adduces. \"During my researches, I have  ascertained beyond all doubt the truth of an opinion I always considered  as indisputable, and which is not controverted by respectable ancient  historians; that these arts in the first place were restored by Cimabue  and Giotto, and afterwards diffused over the world by their disciples;  and I conceived the idea of making it evident by the help of a tree,  which at a glance might shew their progress from the earliest to the  present times.\" He published the first small part of this tree, just as  I exhibit it to the reader; and promised in each succeeding volume to  give another part, that would establish the connexion with the principal  root (Cimabue), or with the branches derived from it; a promise from  which he adroitly delivered himself; therefore we are without any more  than these few branches that follow:                           CIMABUE.    _____________________________________________________    |               |       |         |        |         |    Arnolfo,        |       |         |        |      Oderigi,    |             Gaddo.

But with all his pains he has not satisfied the public expectation, as  is observed by Signor Piacenza, who published the splendid Turin edition  of Baldinucci as far as the life of Franciabigio, accompanied with very  useful notes and dissertations.[50] It is alleged, that to make this  tree fair and flourishing, he has inserted in it branches dexterously  stolen from his neighbours, who have not failed to reclaim their  property. I rejoice to write in an age when the opinions of Baldinucci  have few followers even in Florence. The excellent work entitled  \"_Etruria Pittrice_,\" composed and applauded in that city in proportion  as it is free from the prejudice of former times, proves this  sufficiently. Following in like manner the light of history and of  reason, unswayed by party spirit, I shall in the first place observe,  that among all the scholars of Cimabue, I do not find any named by  Vasari, but Giotto and Arnolfo di Lapo, concerning whom it is certain  that the historian was in error. Lapo and Arnolfo are the names of two  different sculptors, _disciples_ of Niccolo Pisano, who, being already  versed in the art, assisted him in 1266 to adorn with history pieces the  pulpit of the cathedral at Siena, an authentic document of which remains  in the archives of the work.[51] Thus this branch of the tree belongs to  Pisa, unless Cimabue have a claim to it, by contributing in some degree  to the instruction of Arnolfo in the principles of architecture. Andrea  Tafi was the pupil of Apollonius, a Greek artist, and assisted him in  the church of St. John, in some pieces of mosaic, from scriptural  history, which, according to Vasari, are without invention and without  design; but he improved as he proceeded, for the last part of the work  was less despicable than the beginning. Cimabue is not named in these  works, nor in what Tafi afterwards executed without assistance; and as  he was old when Cimabue began to teach, I cannot conceive how he can be  reckoned the scholar of the latter, or a branch from that root. Gaddo  Gaddi, says Vasari, was contemporary with Cimabue, and was his intimate  friend, as well as that of Tafi; through their friendship he received  hints for his improvement in mosaic. At first he followed the manner of  the Greeks, mingled with that of Cimabue. After long working in this  manner, he went to Rome, and there improved his style, while employed on  the facade of S. Maria Maggiore, by his own genius, assisted in my  opinion by imitating the ancient workers in mosaic. He also painted some  altar-pieces, and I saw at Florence one of his crucifixions, of a square  figure, and very respectable workmanship. This circumstance induces me  to consider Gaddo, in some measure, among the imitators of Cimabue, but  not one of his pupils; for it appears to me unjust, should a  contemporary communicate with an artist either as a friend, or for the  sake of advice on the art, to set him immediately down as a branch from  that stock. Vasari relates of Ugolino Senese, that he was a tenacious  follower of the Greek style, and inclined more to imitate Cimabue than  Giotto. He does not on this account, indeed, expressly say, that he had  been his scholar; he rather hints that he had other instructors at  Siena, for which reason it will be better to consider him under that  school, there being no reason to doubt that he belonged to it. In that  of Bologna we should also class Oderigo, who, as a miniature painter,  was more likely to employ some other master than a painter in fresco  like Cimabue. In the mean time it is useful to reflect, that were the  method of Baldinucci to be pursued, nothing authentic would remain in a  history of painting; and the schools of the early masters would increase  beyond all limits, were the scholars of each master to be confounded  with his friends, acquaintances, and contemporaries, who paid attention  to his maxims.    It is still more strange to peruse the account of the connexion between  the first and secondary branches of the tree, or if one may use the  expression, between the children and grandchildren of Cimabue. There is  nothing natural in their succession, and the labour is wholly useless  which derives the professors of every fine art, of whatever country,  past, present, and to come, from one individual. F. Ristoro and F. Sisto  were eminent architects, who rebuilt the grand bridges of the Carraja  and the Holy Trinity, about 1264, when Cimabue was twenty-four years of  age. Baldinucci writes of both, that they were, perhaps, disciples or  imitators of Arnolfo, from the state of their works. But how comes he to  found on a _perhaps_, what he, a little before, had vaunted as a _clear  demonstration_? And then, on what does this _perhaps_ rest? Is it not  more probable that Arnolfo, and Cimabue himself, imitated them? That Fra  Mino da Turrita should appear in his tree as a scholar of Tafi, and as  posterior to Cimabue, is no less absurd. In 1225, a date omitted by  Baldinucci, Mino wrought in mosaic at Florence, fifteen years before  Cimabue was born. In his old age he commenced a similar work in the  cathedral of Pisa, \"in the same style in which he had executed his other  labours,\" says Vasari, who adds, that Tafi and Gaddi (both his inferiors  in age and reputation) assisted him. The work was \"little more than  begun,\" from which we may infer that they were not long associated. It  seems to me extraordinary how Baldinucci could assert, \"it appears that  Vasari imagined that Mino was the pupil of Andrea Tafi,\" which is  contrary to fact: instead of the \"_clear demonstration_,\" which he  promised, he has amused us with \"_it appears_,\" which is evident only to  himself. At length, wishing to make us believe that Giovanni Pisano the  sculptor is a _pupil_ of Giotto the painter, he again turns to Vasari,  from whom he brings evidence that Giovanni, having completed his work in  the cathedral of Arezzo, and being then established at Orvieto, came to  Florence to examine the architecture of S. Maria del Fiore, and to  become acquainted with Giotto: he further notices two pieces which he  executed at Florence, the one a Madonna between two little angels, over  the gate of the cathedral; the other a small baptism of St. John; this  happened in 1297. Here Baldinucci hazards a reflection, that \"if one  compares the other works of this artist with the above mentioned figure  of the Virgin Mary ... we may recognize in it such improvement ... and  so much of the manner of Giotto, that there cannot remain a doubt but he  is to be reckoned a disciple of this master, both in respect of his  imitation of him, and his observance of his precepts, _which he followed  during so many years in the exercise of the profession_.\" Every  attentive reader will discover here not a clear demonstration of the  assumption, but a mass of difficulties. He compares this to the other  figures made by Pisano at Florence, before he was acquainted with  Giotto; and yet this was the first which he there executed. He wishes to  make Giovanni, already sixty years of age, an imitator of Giotto, then  twenty-one, when it is much more probable that Giotto would follow him,  the best sculptor of the age. There is no foundation for the supposed  instruction which Giovanni received from Giotto, who, shortly after,  departed for Rome; where, after some other works, he executed the mosaic  of the _boat_ in 1298. In short, the whole question of preceptorship  rests on no better authority than a single figure. How great are the  inconsistencies in this"]]]
