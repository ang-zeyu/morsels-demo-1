Now it so chanced that, while they fooled it within somewhat  recklessly, he being overwrought with passion, the abbot awoke and passing  slowly by the young monk's cell, heard the noise which they made within, and  the better to distinguish the voices, came softly up to the door of the  cell, and listening discovered that beyond all doubt there was a woman  within. His first thought was to force the door open; but, changing his  mind, he returned to his chamber and waited until the monk should come out.    Delightsome beyond measure though the monk found his intercourse with the  girl, yet was he not altogether without anxiety. He had heard, as he  thought, the sound of footsteps in the dormitory, and having applied his eye  to a convenient aperture had had a good view of the abbot as he stood by the  door listening. He was thus fully aware that the abbot might have detected  the presence of a woman in the cell. Whereat he was exceedingly distressed,  knowing that he had a severe punishment to expect; but he concealed his  vexation from the girl while he busily cast about in his mind for some way  of escape from his embarrassment. He thus hit on a novel stratagem which was  exactly suited to his purpose. With the air of one who had had enough of the  girl's company he said to her:--\"I shall now leave you in order that I may  arrange for your departure hence unobserved. Stay here quietly until I  return.\" So out he went, locking the door of the cell, and withdrawing the  key, which he carried straight to the abbot's chamber and handed to him, as  was the custom when a monk was going out, saying with a composed air:--\"Sir,  I was not able this morning to bring in all the faggots which I had made  ready, so with your leave I will go to the wood and bring them in.\" The  abbot, desiring to have better cognisance of the monk's offence, and not  dreaming that the monk knew that he had been detected, was pleased with the  turn matters had taken, and received the key gladly, at the same time giving  the monk the desired leave. So the monk withdrew, and the abbot began to  consider what course it were best for him to take, whether to assemble the  brotherhood and open the door in their presence, that, being witnesses of  the delinquency, they might have no cause to murmur against him when he  proceeded to punish the delinquent, or whether it were not better first to  learn from the girl's own lips how it had come about. And reflecting that  she might be the wife or daughter of some man who would take it ill that she  should be shamed by being exposed to the gaze of all the monks, he  determined first of all to find out who she was, and then to make up his  mind. So he went softly to the cell, opened the door, and, having entered,  closed it behind him. The girl, seeing that her visitor was none other than  the abbot, quite lost her presence of mind, and quaking with shame began to  weep. Master abbot surveyed her from head to foot, and seeing that she was  fresh and comely, fell a prey, old though he was, to fleshly cravings no  less poignant and sudden than those which the young monk had experienced,  and began thus to commune with himself:--\"Alas! why take I not my pleasure  when I may, seeing that I never need lack for occasions of trouble and  vexation of spirit? Here is a fair wench, and no one in the world to know.  If I can bring her to pleasure me, I know not why I should not do so. Who  will know? No one will ever know; and sin that is hidden is half forgiven;  this chance may never come again; so, methinks, it were the part of wisdom  to take the boon which God bestows.\" So musing, with an altogether different  purpose from that with which he had come, he drew near the girl, and softly  bade her to be comforted, and besought her not to weep; and so little by  little he came at last to show her what he would be at. The girl, being made  neither of iron nor of adamant, was readily induced to gratify the abbot,  who after bestowing upon her many an embrace and kiss, got upon the monk's  bed, where, being sensible, perhaps, of the disparity between his reverend  portliness and her tender youth, and fearing to injure her by his excessive  weight, he refrained from lying upon her, but laid her upon him, and in that  manner disported himself with her for a long time. The monk, who had only  pretended to go to the wood, and had concealed himself in the dormitory, no  sooner saw the abbot enter his cell than he was overjoyed to think that his  plan would succeed; and when he saw that he had locked the door, he was well  assured thereof. So he stole out of his hiding-place, and set his eye to an  aperture through which he saw and heard all that the abbot did and said. At  length the abbot, having had enough of dalliance with the girl, locked her  in the cell and returned to his chamber. Catching sight of the monk soon  afterwards, and supposing him to have returned from the wood, he determined  to give him a sharp reprimand and have him imprisoned, that he might thus  secure the prey for himself alone. He therefore caused him to be summoned,  chid him very severely and with a stern countenance, and ordered him to be  put in prison. The monk replied trippingly:--\"I Sir, I have not been so long  in the order of St. Benedict as to have every particular of the rule by  heart; nor did you teach me before to-day in what posture it behoves the  monk to have intercourse with women, but limited your instruction to such  matters as fasts and vigils. As, however, you have now given me my lesson, I  promise you, if you also pardon my offence, that I will never repeat it, but  will always follow the example which you have set me.\"    The abbot, who was a shrewd man, saw at once that the monk was not only more  knowing than he, but had actually seen what he had done; nor,  conscience-stricken himself, could he for shame mete out to the monk a  measure which he himself merited. So pardon given, with an injunction to  bury what had been seen in silence, they decently conveyed the young girl  out of the monastery, whither, it is to be believed, they now and again  caused her to return.      NOVEL V.    --  The Marchioness of Monferrato by a banquet of hens seasoned with wit checks  the mad passion of the King of France.  --    The story told by Dioneo evoked at first some qualms of shame in the minds  of the ladies, as was apparent by the modest blush that tinged their faces:  then exchanging glances, and scarce able to refrain their mirth, they  listened to it with half-suppressed smiles. On its conclusion they bestowed  upon Dioneo a few words of gentle reprehension with intent to admonish him  that such stories were not to be told among ladies. The queen then turned to  Fiammetta, who was seated on the grass at her side, and bade her follow suit  and Fiammetta with a gay and gracious mien thus began:--    The line upon which our story-telling proceeds, to wit, to shew the virtue  that resides in apt and ready repartees, pleases me well; and as in affairs  of love men and women are in diverse case, for to aspire to the love of a  woman of higher lineage than his own is wisdom in man, whereas a woman's  good sense is then most conspicuous when she knows how to preserve herself  from becoming enamoured of a man, her superior in rank, I am minded, fair my  ladies, to shew you by the story which I am now to tell, how by deed and  word a gentlewoman both defended herself against attack, and weaned her  suitor from his love.    The Marquis of Monferrato, a paladin of distinguished prowess, was gone  overseas as gonfalonier of the Church in a general array of the Christian  forces. Whose merits being canvassed at the court of Philippe le Borgne, on  the eve of his departure from France on the same service, a knight observed,  that there was not under the stars a couple comparable to the Marquis and  his lady; in that, while the Marquis was a paragon of the knightly virtues,  his lady for beauty, and honour was without a peer among all the other  ladies of the world. These words made so deep an impression on the mind of  the King of France that, though he had never seen the lady, he fell ardently  in love with her, and, being to join the armada, resolved that his port of  embarcation should be no other than Genoa, in order that, travelling thither  by land, he might find a decent pretext for visiting the Marchioness, with  whom in the absence of the Marquis he trusted to have the success which he  desired; nor did he fail to put his design in execution. Having sent his  main army on before, he took the road himself with a small company of  gentlemen, and, as they approached the territory of the Marquis, he  despatched a courier to the Marchioness, a day in advance, to let her know  that he expected to breakfast with her the next morning. The lady, who knew  her part and played it well, replied graciously, that he would be indeed  welcome, and that his presence would be the greatest of all favours. She  then began to commune with herself, what this might import, that so great a  king should come to visit her in her husband's absence, nor was she so  deluded as not to surmise that it was the fame of her beauty that drew him  thither. Nevertheless she made ready to do him honour in a manner befitting  her high degree, summoning to her presence such of the retainers as remained  in the castle, and giving all needful directions with their advice, except  that the order of the banquet and the choice of the dishes she reserved  entirely to herself. Then, having caused all the hens that could be found in  the country-side to be brought with all speed into the castle, she bade her  cooks furnish forth the royal"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],[0,"The Domestic Cat (#13)"],[1,"poor ploughman, who lived in a  little hut at the foot of the Moffat Hills, in Scotland, fell sick of a  long, lingering illness--and when the poor are ill they are poorer  still; it is then the shoe pinches.  This poor man had nothing in the  house but meal and milk.  The doctor said he must have wine.  His wife  pledged her marriage-gown to get it.  The doctor said he must have meat.  That was beyond their power to procure.  But a merciful Providence had  willed the man should live; and one day the little tortoiseshell cat,  which was a great favourite with the poor ploughman, and had been very  dull and wretched since his illness, brought in a rabbit--a thing, mind  you, she had never done before--and placed it on the bed.  She appeared  to brighten up as she saw it skinned and cooked by the ploughman's wife,  and partaken of by her sick master.  And next day she brought another,  and so on, almost every day, a rabbit or a bird, until her master was  well, after _which she brought no more_.  I took very considerable pains  to test the truth of this story, and went to some expense about it as  well, and found it in every whit true as first related to me.  [See  \"Cats,\" by same Author.  Dean and Sons, Publishers, 160a, Fleet Street.]    Since then I have had one or two cases precisely similar to the above,  in which cats brought their \"game-bag\" to the bed of a sick master or  mistress.    It is indisputable, then, that such things have been done over and over  again.  And now the question comes to be, how are we to account for it?  In ancient times, these poor, affectionate pussies would doubtless have  been condemned to death as being witches in feline form.    In our own day such cases are usually put down to a special  interposition of Providence.  Now, without doubting for a moment that  there is a Divinity which shapes the end, we must remember that that  Divinity works more by simple laws than miraculous means, and  consequently endeavour to account for the occurrences in a natural way.    Cats, we know, after they have weaned their kittens, are in the habit of  bringing them mice, etc, by way of food.  This we do not think at all  strange, and we put it down to that much-abused term--instinct.  But the  following anecdote shows, I think, something higher than mere instinct,  and will help us to understand why the cat will bring food to a sick  master or mistress.    A certain cat had kittens.  They were all drowned except one, which, of  course, became a great pet with pussy, who, after putting it through a  course of milk, put it through a course of mice, according to the custom  of country cats.  The kitten grew up into a fine large Tom, and was big  enough to thrash his mother, which I'm sorry to say the unfilial rascal  sometimes did.  But a day came when he had need of that mother's love.  Tom had his leg torn off in a trap, and was confined to his pallet of  straw for several weeks, and never, one single day of his illness, did  his mother miss bringing her wounded son either birds or mice, until he  was able to run once more, though on three legs, to go and hunt them for  himself.  This cat is living still, I believe.  It is quite evident that  a cat's affection for, and attachment to, a beloved master, are quite  equal to their love for a grown-up son, and the same feelings which  prompt her to minister to the latter when ill, and unable to move, would  cause her to attend on the other.    Cats easily know when any one they love is sick or ailing.  I returned  home a few years ago, after an absence of some six months, very bad  indeed.  I thought I was a \"gone coon,\" as the Yanks say, and didn't  feel to have any more flesh on my ribs than there is on those telegraph  wires.  Well, my pet cat was rejoiced to see me, and hardly ever left my  room.  She would never leave me, it is true, but still there was  something very strange in her behaviour.  For she must have seen  something strange in my appearance.  Whether she took me for an impostor  or not, I cannot say, but she always sat facing me whenever I was  seated, seldom taking her eyes off my face, and her brows were lowered  as if she were angry with me about something.  What were pussy's  thoughts?  I asked this question one day of my father's housekeeper.  \"The cat kens ye'er no lang for this warld,\" said Eppie; \"gin I were  you, I'd just mak' my callin' and election sure.\"  Calling and election!  How I hated the old rook!  Cats have an idea that when any one is  ailing, it _must_ be for want of food.  Poor things!  How often they  suffer hunger and privations themselves, goodness only can tell!  This  idea is not confined to cats alone.  Dogs, at least, I know possess the  same notion.  I could give many anecdotes to prove this, but as this  book is presumably on cats, I must only give one.    An Inverness-shire student was returning from the south, and with him  his faithful Scottish collie.  In the Highlands there are generally two  roads, the high and the low; the low road being the longest and of  course the safest, and the high much shorter, but usually leading  through some ugly bits of country, which are far from safe even by day,  and much less by night.  It was a beautiful night, quite clear and  starry, with just the slightest crust of snow on the ground, barely  enough to darken the heather.  But such being the case, the student  thought he could easily venture to cross by the hills, and thus save a  mile or two.  Early next morning, a woman at a neighbouring farm was  surprised, while baking bannocks, by the entrance of a strange collie.  The collie did not use much ceremony, but simply stole the largest  bannock, and fled.  This, of course, was not thought much of.  The dog  was hungry, and the morning cold, and he was welcome to the bannock,  although it would have been more satisfactory for both sides had he  asked for it.  The same dog returned, however, in a few hours, and his  behaviour was so strange that one of the family was induced to follow  him.  The dog led him a long way over the mountains, and at last brought  up at the foot of a precipice, near a stream, where \"something dark was  lying.\"  This something dark was no other than the poor student, who had  slipped his foot on the previous night, and tumbled over the rock.  He  was at first supposed to be dead, but soon revived, having merely  fractured a thigh, and become insensible from the cold; but the strange  part of the story is to come--the bannock, all untouched, reclined  against the student's cheek, _placed there by the dog_.  [At page 83,  volume three, \"Annals of Sporting,\" an instance of collie-dog sagacity  very similar to this is given.]    Not only do cats know sickness in others, but they are acquainted in  some way with the mystery of death.  Observe a cat, for instance, that  has played with a mouse until she has killed it.  Just see the critical  way she turns it over and over with her foot, and glares into its  glazing eyes.  She wants to make sure the wee thing is not shamming;  but, being satisfied, mark her as she coolly stretches herself, or walks  slowly away from her victim, as much as to say: \"Well, I've had half an  hour's good fun, anyhow.  Might have eaten it as long as it was alive,  though; but I can't bear a dead mouse.  So it's just as broad as it's  long.\"    CHAPTER FIFTEEN.    TOM, TIMBY, AND TOM BRANDY.      \"The best-laid schemes o' mice and men                    Gang aft agley,    An' leave us nought but grief and pain                    For promised joy.\"      Burns.    And if the schemes of mice and men often \"gang agley,\" it is not to be  wondered at that the sagacity of the domestic cat is sometimes at fault.  A very large and beautiful cat, belonging to a lady in Dumbarton, was  very much attached to its home--more so, perhaps, in this case, than to  its mistress, for one day, much to pussy's disgust, disreputable-looking  men in aprons--so pussy thought them--came to the house and began to  remove the furniture.  Pussy sat on the hearthrug, washing her face with  a spittle and musing.  \"I've been so happy here,\" she was thinking; \"I  know every mouse's hole in the house, and the places in the garden where  I can hide to catch the sparrows, and the gaps in the hedge through  which I can bolt when that Skye-terrier chases me, and the whitethorn  bush beneath whose scented boughs I meet dear Tom in the moonlight.  Oh!  the thoughts of leaving Tom--no, I cannot, will not, leave the old  house.  Missus can hang herself if she likes.  Happy thought, I'll  hide--hide in the linen drawer, till this cruel war is over, and then  come forth, mistress of all I survey.\"  And so she did; but,  unfortunately for her calculations, the chest of drawers was moved as  well; and when at last she did \"come forth,\" much to her bewilderment  she was in a house which she had never seen before in her life.    The following anecdotes may not be thought uninteresting; they are taken  almost at random from hosts of others in my possession, or, if there has  been any choice in the matter, they have been chosen because the three  cats, whose stories here are told, lived in widely different parts of  the globe, clearly proving that a cat is a cat all the world over.  We'll give the English cat the preference.  There is nothing very  wonderful in his history.  Tom was born and bred in Gloucestershire; he  was presented to his master and mistress, the former of whom was a  schoolmaster, when quite a little kitten, and soon became a great  favourite with both.  Tom, who was a tabby, soon grew in strength and  beauty, until there were few male or female cats in the neighbourhood  who did not own him lord and master.  But Tom was so fond of his owners  that he spent but little time either fighting or courting, much to his  credit be it said.  About this time, his master and mistress used to  make frequent visits to a neighbouring village.  Tom"]]]
