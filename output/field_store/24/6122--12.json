We have only to say, that if tobacco  yields this immense revenue annually to England, any one who passes  through Eastern Virginia and sees the poverty stricken appearance of the  thousands of acres of exhausted useless land which present themselves in  every direction, will be able to determine at whose expense this has  been, in a great measure. If England has been enriched by the traffic in  tobacco, its cultivation has been the ruin of Eastern Virginia, by far  the larger portion of which now lies in open uncultivated sterile  commons, bleaching in the sun.    Virginia, we are glad to know, is at last awaking to her true condition  and interests; the rapid increase of population in the northern and  western states, and the proportionate improvement in their arts,  sciences and agricultural industry, have excited in the minds of our  people, no inconsiderable attention. While it is true of Western  Virginia, that if not advancing with a rapidity equalling that of many  of the states, she is nevertheless improving, and with her almost  inexhaustible mineral wealth, and productiveness of soil, must continue  to improve, if the inhabitants persist in declining to cultivate  tobacco. It is painfully true of Eastern Virginia--if we except the  cities--that if not just at this time retrograding, the change from a  retrograde to a stationary condition has been but recent, and some time  must necessarily elapse before any marked evidence of an advance will be  perceptible. There are even yet to be found, on the borders of James  River and in other parts of Virginia, the wealthy, intelligent, and  hospitable planter, living in style and entertaining with liberality  scarcely unequal to that which distinguished Virginia in bygone days.  Such are still to be encountered, though not often. The Virginia  gentleman has been elbowed out. Like the Knickerbockers of New  York--most of whom have shaken the ashes from their pipes, and gone  off--the old Virginia gentleman has disappeared--but been displaced by a  different enemy from that which disturbed the cogitations of the honest  Dutchman. While _Mein Herr_, happy and contented, sat in the door of his  simple dwelling, enjoying the pleasure of his pipe, he little thought,  or if he thought, he little cared perhaps, that the weed which afforded  so much comfort to his constitutionally comfortable frame, was drawing  forth the substance and exhausting the soil of one of the richest,  fairest and most attractive portions of the earth, and would in time  cover its surface with a stunted sickly growth of pine, through which  the wind might pour her low sad requiem for departed life. The honest  Hollander and his good vrow have gone on their journey, exiled by the  enterprising Yankee, or by the needy foreigner. The old Virginia  gentleman has gone, or is going--finding that his \"old fields\" are  rapidly increasing, and his crop of tobacco year by year  diminishing--where no hopes to find a richer soil and a better market.    For some years past, most of the counties in Eastern Virginia have  produced very little tobacco--some of them none at all. When we recall  to mind that this section of Virginia was once by far the richest part  of the state, and not to be surpassed by any soil in the country--that  it was celebrated for the large crops and excellent quality of its  tobacco--we naturally look for the reasons of this change. Now, although  our good friends down below, are very sensitive upon the subject, we  have no hesitation in saying that the cause generally assigned is the  true one, viz., that the soil is exhausted, worn out, and therefore  cannot produce tobacco, or any thing else of consequence. And here let  me encroach upon established rules and digress for a few moments,  leaving tobacco, to give my reader a little advice to aid him should he  ever visit the \"Old Dominion.\" In the first place, if you stop at any  point along the shore, and especially should you reach Hampton, never  speak of \"crabs.\" If you are fond of them, get them the best way you  can; you will have no difficulty in finding them; have them cooked, and  eat them; but don't ask for them--don't speak of them. The people of  Virginia, like those of most other places, are sensitive on some points;  and it would be no less impolite to speak of crabs in Hampton, than it  would be to speak of \"persimmons\" in Fluvanna County.    In the second place, never speak of the ague and fever, especially if  you visit on the rivers, unless it be to say, that the place from which  you came is very subject to this complaint. If you take this position  you are safe, for should you be attacked (cases have been known even in  Virginia), why you have only to say you were so unfortunate as not to  leave home quite soon enough to avoid the disease. Mind what I, an M.D.  of the calomel and quinine school--no Homoeopathist, but one of the  regular troop--say upon this matter. No false charges, either direct or  indirect, no inuendos by look, word, or deed, that you might possibly  have taken the ague and fever after your arrival! It would be absurd, at  least, in you to say so. Not that the people would lay violent hands  upon you--and yet on sober second thoughts I am not so sure of this, if  we are to judge from the toast given by a young gentleman who attended  the Printers' anniversary celebration of the birth of Benjamin Franklin,  at the City Hotel, Richmond, on the night of Saturday, 17th of January:  \"A [symbol: hand] to our friends, and a [symbol: dagger] for our  enemies.\" This, perhaps, might have been simply to vary the  entertainment of the evening. We ought not be hasty in drawing  conclusions, for another young citizen, on the same occasion, gave the  following: \"The first families of Virginia--like stars seen in the  ocean, they would not be there but for their bright originals in  heaven.\" It is evident from this, although there is no roundabout  tedious effort to prove the thing, that the \"first families\" of Virginia  are not only as the stars of heaven in number--not only as thick as  stars, but that like the stars they are absolutely in heaven, and,  having carried their family dignity thither, are emitting their light to  the benighted angels--occasional sparks sometimes dropping down from  them to their numberless descendants, living here upon the shadows of  their grandfathers. It may not be amiss, in order to save future  digression, to say that the Smith in my name is on the paternal side.  Should you come to Virginia, you will hear of the Smiths. You have  already beard of Pocahontas. Well, the land on which her father lived  was famous for its tobacco: it would now be dear at three dollars per  acre. A short time since, while on a visit to and in conversation with  one of the most distinguished men of Virginia, who owns and resides on a  plantation on the James River, a few miles above Richmond--observing the  neatness of every thing around, the superiority of his land and the  largeness of his wheat and corn crops, I inquired about his tobacco. \"I  never cultivate tobacco,\" said he, \"I detest it, for it has been the  ruin of the state.\" This is the testimony of one of Virginia's most  prominent and most enlightened sons, a graduate of William and Mary  College, and the friend of Bishop Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and most of  Virginia's other distinguished men, living in his day--one who, in age,  has passed the threescore and ten allotted to mankind, and whose  dignified yet gentle bearing tells that he is one of the survivors of a  class now nearly extinct, \"the Virginia gentleman of the old school.\"    Pass through almost any part of Eastern Virginia, and wherever you go  will be found immense tracts of land, barren and useless, which were  once rich and productive, but which have been exhausted in the  cultivation of tobacco. And yet--notwithstanding this, and strange as it  may appear--there are still to be found among the people of lower  Virginia men who deny that the raising of this crop impoverishes the  soil, and who on the contrary insist that the culture of tobacco  enriches it. They are ready to acknowledge that the land has been  exhausted, but contend that it is owing to the cultivation of corn, and  not of tobacco. This, it need hardly be said, is maintained only by  those who are engaged in raising tobacco. Facts however are stubborn  things, and it may be well to present, just at this time, one or two in  point.    Virginia, when first settled, possessed a soil far superior to that of  any of the Eastern or Middle States. Little or no tobacco has ever been  raised in those states, while corn has been one of the chief products.  In Virginia, where tobacco has been the principal crop, the land has  deteriorated, the rich soil has been exhausted, and become more sterile  than were the bleak hills of New England when the Pilgrim reached her  shores; while in New England, where corn has been produced in abundance,  and but very little tobacco, the soil has been improved until it has  become almost or quite as rich as that of Virginia was at any time  since its settlement. In this day the most unproductive of the New  England states has soil superior to that of Eastern Virginia.    Another fact that cannot be denied is, that wherever tobacco has been  raised for any length of time, the result has been invariably the  same--without a single exception, the land has been exhausted, and  abandoned as useless. A particular portion of a plantation, it is true,  has been, and may be again for a time, kept very rich by concentrating  upon it all the fertilizing substance produced; but this must of course  be at the expense of all other parts of the plantation, and operate  eventually to the disadvantage of the small part kept rich at the  expense of the whole; for unless there be considerable attention"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31219"],[0,"Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews (#13)"],[1,"or not, but dey wus both Virginia women. So my  missus name wus Mary Gorman.    \"I do not know my age, but I wus 'bout 12 years old when Wheeler's  cavalry come through. Dey skeered me so much I squatted like a rat. Dey  pulled clothes off de line an' stole clothes from stores an' went down  to de depot an' changed clothes. Dey stole de womens drawers an' filled  'em wid things. Dey stole meat, corn an' other things an' put 'em in  womens drawers, throwed 'em across dere horses backs an' went on. You  know women den wore long drawers open in front, ha! ha!    \"Wheeler's cavalry tied up de legs an' front of 'em an' filled de legs  an' seat full of things dey stole. Dey jest grabbed everything an' went  on. Dey had a reason for leavin'; de Yankees wus at dere heels.    \"Jest as soon as dey lef' de Yankees come. You know, dere wus a man  here by de name of Governor Holden an' de flag wus a red an' white  flag, an' when de Yankees come dere wus another flag run up.    \"I want to try to tell de truth 'cause I wus teached dat way by marster  an' missus.    \"De flag brought peace 'cause de Yankees did not tear up de town. Dey  had guards out around de houses an' dey marched back an' forth day an'  night to keep everybody from robbin' de houses.    \"De Yankees wid dere blue uniforms on jest kivered de town. Dey wus  jest like ants. Dey played purty music on de ban' an' I liked dat. I  wus fraid of 'em dough 'cause marster an' missus said dey were goin' to  give us to 'em when dey come. I stayed hid mos' of de time right after  de surrender 'cause I didn't want de Yankees to ketch me. When de  others lef' after de surrender I run away an' went to Rev. Louis  Edwards, a nigger preacher. He sent me to my aunt at Rolesville. My  Aunt wus named Patsy Lewis. I stayed dere bout three weeks when my  uncle rented whur Cameron Park is now an' tended it dat year. We all  come to Raleigh an' I have lived here all my life, but the three weeks  I stayed at Rolesville.    \"I have wurked for white folks, washin', cookin', an' wurkin' at a  laundry ever since freedom come.    \"I never seed my father in my life. My mother wus named Tempe Gorman.  Dey would not talk to me 'bout who my father wus nor where he wus at.  Mother would laf sometime when I axed her 'bout him.    \"Marster treated his niggers mean sometimes. He beat my mother till de  scars wus on her back, so I could see 'em.    \"Dey sold my mother, sister an' brother to ole man Askew, a slave  speculator, an' dey were shipped to de Mississippi bottoms in a  box-car. I never heard from mother anymore. I neber seed my brother  agin, but my sister come back to Charlotte. She come to see me. She  married an' lived dere till she died.    \"In slavery time de food wus bad at marsters. It wus cooked one day for  de nex', dat is de corn bread wus baked an' de meat wus biled an' you  et it col' fer breakfas'. De meat wus as fat as butter an' you got one  rashen an' a hunk of corn bread fer a meal. No biscuit wus seen in de  slave houses. No sir, dat dey wus not. No biscuit for niggers at  marsters.    \"Our clothes wus bad an' our sleepin' places wus jest bunks. Our shoes  had wooden bottoms on 'em.    \"I heard 'em talk about patterollers so much I wus skeered so I could  hardly sleep at night sometimes. I wus 'fraid dey would come an' catch  me but I neber seed one in my life.    \"I neber seed any slaves sold, in chains, or a jail for slaves. I neber  seed a slave whupped. Marster took 'em in de back shed room to whup  'em.    \"We was not teached to read an' write. You better not be caught wid no  paper in yore han' if you was, you got de cowhide. I darsent to talk  back to 'em no matter what happen'd dey would git you if you talked  back to 'em.    \"I married Tom Mitchner after de war. I went by de name of Patsy Gorman  till I wus married. Now I goes by de name of Patsy Mitchner. My  husban', Tom Mitchner, was born a slave. My marster lived whar de bus  station now is on de corner of Martin an' McDowell Streets in dat ole  house dat stan's near dere now.

He give us medicine an' kep us clean out better en people is  clean out now. Dr. John McKee at de City Hall is his son. Dey pays no  'tention to me now; guess dey has forgotten me.    \"Did you say ghosts, Lawsy, no I neber seed one but our spirits is  always wonderin' aroun' eben before we dies. Spirits is wonderin'  eberywhere an' you has to look out for 'em.    \"Witches is folks. I neber had a spell put on me by one, but I knowed a  woman once who had a spell put on 'er, an' it hurt her feet, but a ole  white man witch doctor helped take de spell off, but I think it wus de  Lord who took it off.

Dey all looked at de black rain cloud in de west wid sor'ful  faces as if dey felt dey didn't know what use dey had for rain after  dey got it. Den one of de brothers said to de other brothers kinder  easy an' shameful like, 'Brothers don't you think we overdone dis  thing?' Dats what many a slave thought 'bout prayin' for freedom.    \"Before two years had passed after de surrender dere wus two out of  every three slaves who wushed dey wus back wid dere marsters.    \"De marsters kindness to de niggers after de war is de cause of de  nigger havin' things today. Dere wus a lot of love between marster an'  slave en dar is few of us dat don't love de white folks today.    \"Slavery wus a bad thing an' freedom, of de kin' we got wid nothin' to  live on wus bad.
