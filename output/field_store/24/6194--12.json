Here, good mistress housekeeper, open that window, and throw it  into the yard, and let it serve as a foundation to that pile we are to  set a blazing presently.\" She was not slack in her obedience; and thus  poor Don Esplandian was sent headlong into the yard, there patiently  to wait the time of punishment.    \"To the next,\" cried the curate. \"This,\" said the barber, \"is Amadis  of Greece; and I'm of opinion that all those that stand on this side  are of the same family.\" \"Then let them all be sent packing into the  yard,\" replied the curate. They were delivered to the housekeeper  accordingly, and many they were; and to save herself the labour of  carrying them down stairs, she fairly sent them flying out at the  window.    \"What overgrown piece of lumber have we here?\" cried the curate.  \"Olivante de Laura,\" returned the barber. \"The same author wrote the  Garden of Flowers; and, to deal ingeniously with you, I cannot tell  which of the two books has most truth in it, or, to speak more  properly, less lies: but this I know for certain, that he shall march  into the back-yard, like a nonsensical arrogant blockhead as he is.\"    \"The next,\" cried the barber, \"is Florismart of Hyrcania.\" \"How! my  Lord Florismart, is he here?\" replied the curate: \"nay, then truly, he  shall e'en follow the rest to the yard, in spite of his wonderful  birth and incredible adventures; for his rough, dull, and insipid  style deserves no better usage. Come, toss him into the yard, and this  other too, good mistress.\"    \"Here's the noble Don Platir,\" cried the barber. \"'Tis an old book,\"  replied the curate, \"and I can think of nothing in him that deserves a  grain of pity: away with him, without any more words;\" and down he  went accordingly.    Another book was opened, and it proved to be the Knight of the Cross.  \"The holy title,\" cried the curate, \"might in some measure atone for  the badness of the book; but then, as the saying is, _The devil lurks  behind the cross_! To the flames with him.\"    Then opening another volume, he found it to be Palmerin de Oliva, and  the next to that Palmerin of England. \"Ha, have I found you!\" cried  the curate. \"Here, take that Oliva, let him be torn to pieces, then  burnt, and his ashes scattered in the air; but let Palmerin of England  be preserved as a singular relic of antiquity; and let such a costly  box be made for him as Alexander found among the spoils of Darius,  which he devoted to enclose Homer's works: for I must tell you,  neighbour, that book deserves particular respect for two things;  first, for its own excellencies; and, secondly, for the sake of its  author, who is said to have been a learned king of Portugal: then all  the adventures of the Castle of Miraguarda are well and artfully  managed, the dialogue very courtly and clear, and the decorum strictly  observed in equal character, with equal propriety and judgment.  Therefore, Master Nicholas,\" continued he, \"with submission to your  better advice, this and Amadis de Gaul shall be exempted from the  fire; and let all the rest be condemned, without any further inquiry  or examination.\" \"By no means, I beseech you,\" returned the barber,  \"for this which I have in my hands is the famous Don Bellianis.\"  \"Truly,\" cried the curate, \"he, with his second, third, and fourth  parts, had need of a dose of rhubarb to purge his excessive choler:  besides, his Castle of Fame should be demolished, and a heap of other  rubbish removed; in order to which I give my vote to grant them the  benefit of a reprieve; and as they shew signs of amendment, so shall  mercy or justice be used towards them: in the mean time, neighbour,  take them into custody, and keep them safe at home; but let none be  permitted to converse with them.\" \"Content,\" cried the barber; and to  save himself the labour of looking on any more books of that kind, he  bid the housekeeper take all the great volumes, and throw them into  the yard. This was not spoken to one stupid or deaf, but to one who  had a greater mind to be burning them, than weaving the finest and  largest web: so that laying hold of no less than eight volumes at  once, she presently made them leap towards the place of execution.  \"But what shall we do with all these smaller books that are left?\"  said the barber. \"Certainly,\" replied the curate, \"these cannot be  books of knight-errantry, they are too small; you will find they are  only poets.\" And so opening one, it happened to be the Diana of  Montemayor; which made him say, (believing all the rest to be of that  stamp) \"These do not deserve to be punished like the others, for they  neither have done, nor can do, that mischief which those stories of  chivalry have done, being generally ingenious books, that can do  nobody any prejudice.\" \"Oh! good sir,\" cried the niece, \"burn them  with the rest, I beseech you; for should my uncle get cured of his  knight-errant frenzy, and betake himself to the reading of these  books, we should have him turn shepherd, and so wander through the  woods and fields; nay, and what would be worse yet, turn poet, which  they say is a catching and incurable disease.\" \"The gentlewoman is in  the right,\" said the curate; \"and it will not be amiss to remove that  stumbling-block out of our friend's way; and since we began with the  Diana of Montemayor, I am of opinion we ought not to burn it, but only  take out that part of it which treats of the magician Felicia and the  enchanted water, as also all the longer poems; and let the work escape  with its prose, and the honour of being the first of that kind.\"  \"Here,\" quoth the barber, \"I've a book called the Ten Books of the  Fortunes of Love, by Anthony de Lofraco, a Sardinian poet.\" \"Now we  have got a prize,\" cried the curate, \"I do not think since Apollo was  Apollo, the muses muses, and the poets poets, there ever was a more  humorous, more whimsical book! Of all the works of the kind commend me  to this, for in its way 'tis certainly the best and most singular that  ever was published; and he that never read it may safely think he  never in his life read any thing that was pleasant.\" With that he laid  it aside with extraordinary satisfaction; and the barber went on: \"The  next,\" said he, \"is the Shepherd of Filida.\" \"He's no shepherd,\"  returned the curate, \"but a very discreet courtier; keep him as a  precious jewel.\" \"Here's a bigger,\" cried the barber, \"called the  Treasure of divers Poems.\" \"Had there been less of it,\" said the  curate, \"it would have been more esteemed. 'Tis fit the book should be  pruned and cleared of some inferior things that encumber and deform  it: keep it, however, because the author is my friend, and for the  sake of his other more heroic and lofty productions. What's the next  book?\" \"The Galatea of Miguel de Cervantes,\" replied the barber. \"That  Cervantes has been my intimate acquaintance these many years,\" cried  the curate; \"and I know he has been more conversant with misfortunes  than with poetry. His book, indeed, has I don't know what, that looks  like a good design; he aims at something, but concludes nothing:  therefore we must stay for the second part, which he has promised us;  perhaps he may make us amends, and obtain a full pardon, which is  denied him for the present; till that time keep him close prisoner at  your house.\" \"I will,\" quoth the barber: \"but see, I have here three  more for you, the Araucana of Don Alonso de Ercilla; the Austirada of  Juan Ruffo, a magistrate of Cordova; and the Monserrato of Christopher  de Virves, a Valentian poet.\" \"These,\" cried the curate, \"are the best  heroic poems we have in Spanish, and may vie with the most celebrated  of Italy: reserve them as the most valuable performances which Spain  has to boast of in poetry.\"    At last the curate grew so tired with prying into so many volumes,  that he ordered all the rest to be burnt at a venture. But the barber  shewed him one which he had opened by chance ere the dreadful sentence  was past. \"Truly,\" said the curate, who saw by the title it was the  Tears of Angelica, \"I should have wept myself, had I caused such a  book to share the condemnation of the rest; for the author was not  only one of the best poets in Spain, but in the whole world, and  translated some of Ovid's fables with extraordinary success.\"          CHAPTER VII.    _Don Quixote's second sally in quest of adventures._      Full fifteen days did our knight remain quietly at home, without  betraying the least sign of his desire to renew his rambling; during  which time there passed a great deal of pleasant discourse between him  and his two friends, the curate and the barber; while he maintained,  that there was nothing the world stood so much in need of as  knights-errant; wherefore he was resolved to revive the order: in  which disputes Mr. Curate sometimes contradicted him, and sometimes  submitted; for had he not now and then given way to his fancies, there  would have been no conversing with him.    In the mean time Don Quixote solicited one of his neighbours, a  country labourer and honest fellow, though poor in purse as well as in  brains, to become his squire; in short, the knight talked long to him,  plied him with so many arguments, and made him so many fair promises,  that at last the poor silly clown consented to go along with him, and  be his squire. Among other inducements to entice him to do it  willingly, Don Quixote forgot not to tell him, that it was likely such  an adventure would present itself, as might secure him the conquest of  some island in the time that he might be picking up a straw or two,  and then the squire might promise himself to be made governor of the  place. Allured with these large promises, and many others, Sancho  Panza (for that was the name of the fellow) forsook his wife and  children to be his neighbour's squire.    This done, Don Quixote made it his business to furnish himself with  money; to which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/360"],[0,"What is Property? An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#13)"],[1,"ideas. He went about proclaiming everywhere that the end of the  existing society was at hand, that the world was about to experience a  new birth; that the priests were vipers, the lawyers ignoramuses,  and the philosophers hypocrites and liars; that master and slave  were equals, that usury and every thing akin to it was robbery, that  proprietors and idlers would one day burn, while the poor and pure in  heart would find a haven of peace.    This man--The Word of God--was denounced and arrested as a public enemy  by the priests and the lawyers, who well understood how to induce the  people to demand his death. But this judicial murder, though it put the  finishing stroke to their crimes, did not destroy the doctrinal seeds  which The Word of God had sown. After his death, his original disciples  travelled about in all directions, preaching what they called the GOOD  NEWS, creating in their turn millions of missionaries; and, when their  task seemed to be accomplished, dying by the sword of Roman justice.  This persistent agitation, the war of the executioners and martyrs,  lasted nearly three centuries, ending in the conversion of the world.  Idolatry was destroyed, slavery abolished, dissolution made room for a  more austere morality, and the contempt for wealth was sometimes pushed  almost to privation.    Society was saved by the negation of its own principles, by a revolution  in its religion, and by violation of its most sacred rights. In this  revolution, the idea of justice spread to an extent that had not before  been dreamed of, never to return to its original limits. Heretofore  justice had existed only for the masters; [7] it then commenced to exist  for the slaves.    Nevertheless, the new religion at that time had borne by no means all  its fruits. There was a perceptible improvement of the public morals,  and a partial release from oppression; but, other than that, the SEEDS  SOWN BY THE SON OF MAN, having fallen into idolatrous hearts, had  produced nothing save innumerable discords and a quasi-poetical  mythology. Instead of developing into their practical consequences the  principles of morality and government taught by The Word of God, his  followers busied themselves in speculations as to his birth, his origin,  his person, and his actions; they discussed his parables, and from the  conflict of the most extravagant opinions upon unanswerable questions  and texts which no one understood, was born THEOLOGY,--which may be  defined as the SCIENCE OF THE INFINITELY ABSURD.    The truth of CHRISTIANITY did not survive the age of the apostles; the  GOSPEL, commented upon and symbolized by the Greeks and Latins, loaded  with pagan fables, became literally a mass of contradictions; and to  this day the reign of the INFALLIBLE CHURCH has been a long era of  darkness. It is said that the GATES OF HELL will not always prevail,  that THE WORD OF GOD will return, and that one day men will know truth  and justice; but that will be the death of Greek and Roman Catholicism,  just as in the light of science disappeared the caprices of opinion.    The monsters which the successors of the apostles were bent on  destroying, frightened for a moment, reappeared gradually, thanks to the  crazy fanaticism, and sometimes the deliberate connivance, of priests  and theologians. The history of the enfranchisement of the French  communes offers constantly the spectacle of the ideas of justice and  liberty spreading among the people, in spite of the combined efforts of  kings, nobles, and clergy. In the year 1789 of the Christian era, the  French nation, divided by caste, poor and oppressed, struggled in the  triple net of royal absolutism, the tyranny of nobles and parliaments,  and priestly intolerance. There was the right of the king and the right  of the priest, the right of the patrician and the right of the plebeian;  there were the privileges of birth, province, communes, corporations,  and trades; and, at the bottom of all, violence, immorality, and misery.  For some time they talked of reformation; those who apparently desired  it most favoring it only for their own profit, and the people who were  to be the gainers expecting little and saying nothing. For a long  time these poor people, either from distrust, incredulity, or despair,  hesitated to ask for their rights: it is said that the habit of serving  had taken the courage away from those old communes, which in the middle  ages were so bold.    Finally a book appeared, summing up the whole matter in these two  propositions: WHAT IS THE THIRD ESTATE?--NOTHING. WHAT OUGHT IT  TO BE?--EVERY THING. Some one added by way of comment: WHAT IS THE  KING?--THE SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE.    This was a sudden revelation: the veil was torn aside, a thick bandage  fell from all eyes. The people commenced to reason thus:--    If the king is our servant, he ought to report to us;    If he ought to report to us, he is subject to control;    If he can be controlled, he is responsible;    If he is responsible, he is punishable;    If he is punishable, he ought to be punished according to his merits;    If he ought to be punished according to his merits, he can be punished  with death.    Five years after the publication of the brochure of Sieyes, the third  estate was every thing; the king, the nobility, the clergy, were no  more. In 1793, the nation, without stopping at the constitutional  fiction of the inviolability of the sovereign, conducted Louis XVI. to  the scaffold; in 1830, it accompanied Charles X. to Cherbourg. In each  case, it may have erred, in fact, in its judgment of the offence; but,  in right, the logic which led to its action was irreproachable. The  people, in punishing their sovereign, did precisely that which the  government of July was so severely censured for failing to do when it  refused to execute Louis Bonaparte after the affair of Strasburg: they  struck the true culprit. It was an application of the common law, a  solemn decree of justice enforcing the penal laws. [8]    The spirit which gave rise to the movement of '89 was a spirit of  negation; that, of itself, proves that the order of things which was  substituted for the old system was not methodical or well-considered;  that, born of anger and hatred, it could not have the effect of a  science based on observation and study; that its foundations, in a word,  were not derived from a profound knowledge of the laws of Nature and  society. Thus the people found that the republic, among the so-called  new institutions, was acting on the very principles against which they  had fought, and was swayed by all the prejudices which they had intended  to destroy. We congratulate ourselves, with inconsiderate enthusiasm,  on the glorious French Revolution, the regeneration of 1789, the great  changes that have been effected, and the reversion of institutions: a  delusion, a delusion!    When our ideas on any subject, material, intellectual, or social,  undergo a thorough change in consequence of new observations, I call  that movement of the mind REVOLUTION. If the ideas are simply extended  or modified, there is only PROGRESS. Thus the system of Ptolemy was a  step in astronomical progress, that of Copernicus was a revolution. So,  in 1789, there was struggle and progress; revolution there was none. An  examination of the reforms which were attempted proves this.    The nation, so long a victim of monarchical selfishness, thought to  deliver itself for ever by declaring that it alone was sovereign. But  what was monarchy? The sovereignty of one man. What is democracy? The  sovereignty of the nation, or, rather, of the national majority. But it  is, in both cases, the sovereignty of man instead of the sovereignty of  the law, the sovereignty of the will instead of the sovereignty of the  reason; in one word, the passions instead of justice. Undoubtedly, when  a nation passes from the monarchical to the democratic state, there  is progress, because in multiplying the sovereigns we increase the  opportunities of the reason to substitute itself for the will; but in  reality there is no revolution in the government, since the principle  remains the same. Now, we have the proof to-day that, with the most  perfect democracy, we cannot be free. [9]    Nor is that all. The nation-king cannot exercise its sovereignty itself;  it is obliged to delegate it to agents: this is constantly reiterated by  those who seek to win its favor. Be these agents five, ten, one hundred,  or a thousand, of what consequence is the number; and what matters the  name? It is always the government of man, the rule of will and caprice.  I ask what this pretended revolution has revolutionized?    We know, too, how this sovereignty was exercised; first by the  Convention, then by the Directory, afterwards confiscated by the Consul.  As for the Emperor, the strong man so much adored and mourned by the  nation, he never wanted to be dependent on it; but, as if intending to  set its sovereignty at defiance, he dared to demand its suffrage: that  is, its abdication, the abdication of this inalienable sovereignty; and  he obtained it.    But what is sovereignty? It is, they say, the POWER TO MAKE LAW. [10]  Another absurdity, a relic of despotism. The nation had long seen kings  issuing their commands in this form: FOR SUCH IS OUR PLEASURE; it wished  to taste in its turn the pleasure of making laws. For fifty years it  has brought them forth by myriads; always, be it understood, through the  agency of representatives. The play is far from ended.    The definition of sovereignty was derived from the definition of the  law. The law, they said, is THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF THE SOVEREIGN:  then, under a monarchy, the law is the expression of the will of the  king; in a republic, the law is the expression of the will of the  people. Aside from the difference in the number of wills, the two  systems are exactly identical: both share the same"]]]
