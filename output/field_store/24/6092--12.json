Sprinkle them with fine crumbs, fry them of a yellow brown,  and serve with gravy, as for Beef Olives.      BEEF COLLOPS. Cut thin slices of beef from the rump, or any other tender  part, and divide them into pieces three inches long: beat them with the  blade of a knife, and flour them. Fry the collops quick in butter two  minutes; then lay them into a small stewpan, and cover them with a pint  of gravy. Add a bit of butter rubbed in flour, pepper and salt, a little  bit of shalot shred very fine, with half a walnut, four small pickled  cucumbers, and a tea-spoonful of capers cut small. Be careful that the  stew does not boil, and serve in a hot covered dish.      BEEF FRICASSEE. Cut some thin slices of cold roast beef, shred a handful  of parsley very small, cut an onion into quarters, and put them all  together into a stewpan, with a piece of butter, and some strong broth.  Season with salt and pepper, and simmer very gently for a quarter of an  hour. Mix into it the yolks of two eggs, a glass of port wine, and a  spoonful of vinegar: stir it quick, rub the dish with shalot, and turn  the fricassee into it.      BEEF GRAVY. Cover the bottom of a stewpan, clean and well-tinned, with a  slice of good ham or lean bacon, four or five pounds of gravy beef cut  in pieces, an onion, a carrot, two cloves, and a head of celery. Add a  pint of broth or water, cover it close, and simmer it till the liquor is  nearly all exhausted. Turn it about, and let it brown slightly and  equally all over, but do not suffer it to burn or stick to the pan, for  that would spoil the gravy. Then put in three quarts of boiling water;  and when it boils up, skim it carefully, and wipe off with a clean  cloth what sticks round the edge and inside of the stewpan, that the  gravy may be delicately clean and clear. Let it stew gently by the side  of the fire for about four hours, till reduced to two quarts of good  gravy. Take care to skim it well, strain it through silk or muslin, and  set it in a cold place.      BEEF HAMS. Cut the leg of beef like a ham; and for fourteen pounds  weight, mix a pound of salt, a pound of brown sugar, an ounce of  saltpetre, and an ounce of bay salt. Put it into the meat, turn and  baste it every day, and let it lie a month in the pickle. Then take it  out, roll it in bran, and smoke it. Afterwards hang it in a dry place,  and cut off pieces to boil, or broil it with poached eggs.      BEEF HASH. Cut some thin slices of beef that is underdone, with some of  the fat; put it into a small stewpan, with a little onion or shalot, a  little water, pepper and salt. Add some of the gravy, a spoonful of  vinegar, and of walnut ketchup: if shalot vinegar be used, there will be  no need of the onion nor the raw shalot. The hash is only to be simmered  till it is hot through, but not boiled: it is owing to the boiling of  hashes and stews that they get hard. When the hash is well warmed up,  pour it upon sippets of bread previously prepared, and laid in a warm  dish.      BEEF HEART. Wash it carefully, stuff it as a hare, and serve with rich  gravy and currant-jelly sauce. Hash it with the same, and add a little  port wine.      BEEF OLIVES. Take some cold beef that has not been done enough, and cut  slices half an inch thick, and four inches square. Lay on them a  forcemeat of crumbs of bread, shalot, a little suet or fat, pepper and  salt. Roll and fasten them with a small skewer, put them into a stewpan  with some gravy made of the beef bones, or the gravy of the meat, and a  spoonful or two of water, and stew them till tender. Beef olives may  also be made of fresh meat.      BEEF PALATES. Simmer them in water several hours, till they will peel.  Then cut the palates into slices, or leave them whole, and stew them in  a rich gravy till they become as tender as possible. Season with  cayenne, salt and ketchup: if the gravy was drawn clear, add also some  butter and flour. If the palates are to be dressed white, boil them in  milk, and stew them in a fricassee sauce; adding cream, butter, flour,  mushroom powder, and a little pounded mace.      BEEF PASTY. Bone a small rump or part of a sirloin of beef, after  hanging several days. Beat it well with a rolling pin; then rub ten  pounds of meat with four ounces of sugar, and pour over it a glass of  port, and the same of vinegar. Let it lie five days and nights; wash and  wipe the meat very dry, and season it high with pepper and salt, nutmeg  and Jamaica pepper. Lay it in a dish, and to ten pounds add nearly one  pound of butter, spreading it over the meat. Put a crust round the  edges, and cover with a thick one, or it will be overdone before the  meat is soaked: it must be baked in a slow oven. Set the bones in a pan  in the oven, with no more water than will cover them, and one glass of  port, a little pepper and salt, in order to provide a little rich gravy  to add to the pasty when drawn. It will be found that sugar gives more  shortness and a better flavour to meat than salt, too great a quantity  of which hardens; and sugar is quite as good a preservative.      BEEF PATTIES. Shred some dressed beef under done, with a little fat;  season with salt and pepper, and a little shalot or onion. Make a plain  paste, roll it thin, and cut it in shape like an apple puff. Fill it  with mince, pinch the edges, and fry them of a nice brown. The paste  should be made with a small quantity of butter, egg and milk.      BEEF PIE. Season some cuttings of beef with pepper and salt, put some  puff paste round the inside of the dish, and lay in the meat. Add some  small potatoes, if approved, fill up the dish with water, and cover it  with the paste.      BEEF PUDDING. Roll some fine steaks with fat between, and a very little  shred onion. Lay a paste of suet in a bason, put in the rolled steaks,  cover the bason with a paste, and pinch the edges to keep in the gravy.  Cover with a cloth tied close, and let the pudding boil slowly a  considerable time.--If for baking, make a batter of milk, two eggs and  flour, or, which is much better, potatoes boiled, and mashed through a  cullender. Lay a little of it at the bottom of the dish, then put in the  steaks prepared as above, and very well seasoned. Pour the remainder of  the batter over them, and bake it.      BEEF SANDERS. Mince some beef small, with onion, pepper and salt, and  add a little gravy. Put it into scallop shells or saucers, making them  three parts full, and fill them up with potatoes, mashed with a little  cream. Put a bit of butter on the top, and brown them in an oven, or  before the fire, or with a salamander. Mutton may be made into sanders  in the same way.      BEEF SCALLOPS. Mince some beef fine, with onion, pepper and salt, and  add a little gravy. Put the mince into scallop shells or saucers three  parts full, and fill them up with potatoes, mashed with a little cream.  Lay a bit of butter on the tops, and brown them in an oven, or before  the fire.      BEEF STEAKS. To have them fine, they should be cut from a rump that has  hung a few days. Broil them over a very clear or charcoal fire; put into  the dish a little minced shalot, a table-spoonful of ketchup. The steak  should be turned often, that the gravy may not be drawn out on either  side. This dish requires to be eaten so hot and fresh done, that it is  not in perfection if served with any thing else. Pepper and salt should  be added when taking it off the fire, and a bit of butter rubbed on at  the moment of serving. If accompanied with oyster sauce, strain off the  liquor from the oysters, and throw them into cold water to take off the  grit, while you simmer the liquor with a bit of mace and lemon peel.  Then put in the oysters, stew them a few minutes, add a little cream,  and some butter rubbed in a bit of flour. Let them boil up once, and  throw the sauce over the steaks at the moment of sending the dish to  table.      BEEF STEW. Cut into small pieces four or five pounds of beef, with some  hard fat. Put these into a stewpan, with three pints of water, a little  salt and pepper, a sprig of sweet herbs, and three cloves. Cover the pan  very close, and let it stew four hours over a slow fire. Throw in some  carrots and turnips, cut into square pieces; the white part of a leek,  with two heads of celery chopped fine; a crust of bread, and two  spoonfuls of vinegar. When done, put it into a deep dish, set it over  hot water, and cover it close. Skim the gravy, and put in a few pickled  mushrooms; thicken it with flour and butter, make it hot, and pour it  over the beef.      BEEF TEA. Cut a pound of fleshy beef into thin slices; simmer it with a  quart of water twenty minutes, after it has once boiled, and been  skimmed. Season it, if approved; but a little salt only is sufficient.      BEEF VINGRETTE. Cut a slice of under-done boiled beef three inches  thick, and a little fat. Stew it in half a pint of water, a glass of  white wine, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a bay leaf. Season it  with three cloves pounded, and pepper, till the liquor is nearly wasted  away, turning it once. Serve it up cold. Strain off the gravy, and mix  it with a little vinegar for sauce.      BEER. During the present ruinous system of taxation, it is extremely  difficult, though highly desirable, to procure a cheap and wholesome  beverage, especially for the labouring part of the community, to whom it  is as needful as their daily food. Beer that is brewed and drunk at  home, is more pure and nutricious than what is generally purchased at an  alehouse; and those who cannot afford a better article, may perhaps find  it convenient to adopt the following method for obtaining some cheap  drink for small families.--To half a bushel of malt, add four pounds of  treacle, and three quarters of a pound of hops. This will make  twenty-five gallons of wholesome beer,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29086"],[0,"The Mushroom, Edible and Otherwise (#13)"],[1,"adnate, arcuate, white at first, turning  to a light gray tinged with an intimation of red, notched with a  decurrent tooth.    The stem is short, slightly bulbous, tapering upward, solid, smooth,  about the same color as the cap. The spores are subglobose, 5-6.    I found the specimens in Figure 48 under pine trees, growing on a bed of  pine needles, on Cemetery Hill. They were found on the 9th of November.    Var. calceolum, Sterb., has the pileus spongy, deformed, thin, soft,  expanded, edge incurved, sooty-gray; gills smoky; stem excentric,  fusiform, very short.      _Tricholoma columbetta. Fr._    THE DOVE-COLORED TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 49.--Tricholoma columbetta. One-third natural  size. Caps white. Stems bulbous.]    Columbetta is the diminutive of _columba_, a dove; so called from the  color of the plant. The pileus is from one to four inches broad, fleshy,  convex, then expanded; at first smooth, then silky; white, center  sometimes a dilute mouse color shading to a white, frequently a tinge of  pink will be seen on the margin, which is at first inrolled, tomentose  in young plants, sometimes cracked.    The gills are notched at the junction of the stem, crowded, thin, white,  brittle.    The stem is two inches or more long, solid, white, cylindrical, unequal,  often compressed, smooth, crooked, silky especially in young plants,  bulbous. Spores .00023 by .00018 inch. Flesh white, taste mild.    This is a beautiful plant, seeming to be quite free from insects, and  will remain sound for several days on your study table. I had no end of  trouble with it till Dr. Herbst suggested the species. It is quite  plentiful here. Dr. Peck gives quite a number of varieties. Curtis,  McIlvaine, Stevenson, and Cooke all speak of its esculent qualities.  Found in the woods in September and October.      _Tricholoma melaleucum. Pers._    THE CHANGEABLE TRICHOLOMA.    [Illustration: Figure 50.--Tricholoma melaleucum. Two-thirds natural  size.]    Melaleucum, black and white; from contrasted colors of the cap and  gills.    This Tricholoma grows in abundance in northern Ohio. I have found it in  the woods near Bowling Green, Ohio. The specimens in the halftone were  found near Sandusky, Ohio, and were photographed by Dr. Kellerman. It is  usually found in sandy soil, growing singly in shady woods.    The pileus fleshy, thin, from one to three inches broad, convex, rather  broadly umbonate, smooth, moist, with variable color, usually pale,  nearly white at first, later much darker, sometimes slightly wavy.    The gills are notched, adnexed, ventricose, crowded, white.    The stem is stuffed, then hollow, elastic, from two to four inches long,  somewhat smooth, whitish, sprinkled with a few fibrils, usually  thickened at the base. The flesh is soft and white. There is no report,  so far as I know, regarding its edibility, and I have no doubt as to  this, but would advise caution.      _Tricholoma lascivum. Fr._    THE TARRY TRICHOLOMA.    Lascivum, playful, wanton; so called because of its many affinities,  none of which are very close. The pileus is fleshy, convex, then  expanded, slightly obtuse, somewhat depressed, silky at first, then  smooth, even. The gills are notched, adnexed, crowded, white; the stem  is solid, equal, rigid, rooting, white, tomentose at the base. Found in  the woods, Haynes' Hollow near Chillicothe. September and October.      _Tricholoma Russula. Schaeff._    THE REDDISH TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 51.--Tricholoma Russula. Natural size. Caps  reddish or flesh color.]    Russula is so named because of its likeness in color to some species of  the genus Russula.    The pileus is three to four inches broad, fleshy, convex, then  depressed, viscid, even or dotted with granular scales, red or flesh  color, the margin somewhat paler, involute and minutely downy in the  young plant.    The gills are rounded or slightly decurrent, rather distant, white,  often becoming red-spotted with age.    The stem is two to three inches long, solid, firm, whitish rosy-red,  nearly equal, scaly at the apex. The spores are elliptical, 10x5u.    This plant is quite variable in many of its peculiar characteristics,  yet it usually has enough to readily distinguish it. The cap may be  flesh-color and the stem rosy-red, the cap may be red and the stem white  or whitish with stains of red. During wet weather the caps of all are  viscid; when dry, all may be cracked more or less. The stems may not be  scaly at the apex, often rosy when young. They are found in the woods  solitary, in groups, or frequently in dense clusters. The specimens in  Figure 51 were found in Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fischer.    I found this plant in Poke Hollow. The gills were quite decurrent.      _Tricholoma acerbum. Bull._    THE BITTER TRICHOLOMA.    Acerbum means bitter to the taste.    The pileus is three to four inches broad, convex to expanded, obtuse,  smooth, more or less spotted, margin thin, at first involute, rugose,  sulcate, viscid, whitish, often tinged rufous, or yellow, quite bitter  to the taste.    The gills are notched, crowded, pallid or rufescent, narrow.    The stem is solid, rather short, blunt, yellowish, squamulose above or  about the apex. The spores are subglobose, 5-6u.    These plants were found growing in a thick bed of moss along with  Armillaria nardosmia. They were not perfect plants but I judged them to  be T. acerbum from their taste and involute margin. I sent some to Prof.  Atkinson, who confirmed my classification. They grow in open woods in  October and November.      _Tricholoma cinerascens. Bull._    Cinerascens means becoming the color of ashes.    The pileus is two to three inches broad, fleshy, convex to expanded,  even, obtuse, smooth, white, then grayish, margin thin.    The gills are emarginate, crowded, rather undulate, dingy, reddish often  yellowish, easily separating from the pileus.    The stem is stuffed, equal, smooth, elastic.    They grow in clusters in mixed wood. They are mild to the taste.      _Tricholoma album. Schaeff._    THE WHITE TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: Figure 52.--Tricholoma album. Entirely white.]    Album means white.    The pileus is two to four inches broad, fleshy, entirely white, convex,  then depressed, obtuse, smooth, dry, disc frequently tinged with yellow,  margin at first involute, at length repand.    The gills are rounded behind, rather crowded, thin, white, broad.    The stem is two to four inches long, solid, firm, narrowed upwards,  smooth.    This plant is quite plentiful in our woods, growing usually in groups.  It grows upon the leaf mould and is frequently quite large. It is quite  acrid to the taste when raw, but this is overcome in cooking. It is  found from August to October.    These plants are quite plentiful on the wooded hillsides about  Chillicothe. Those in Figure 52 were found on Ralston's Run and  photographed by Dr. Kellerman.      _Tricholoma imbricatum. Fr._    THE IMBRICATED TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd_    Figure 53.--Tricholoma imbricatum.]    Imbricatum means covered with tiles, _imbreces_, referring to the  lacerated condition of the cap. This species is very closely related to  T. transmutans in size, color and taste. It is, however, easily  separated by its dry cap and solid stem. Its cap is reddish-brown or  cinnamon-brown, and its surface often presents a somewhat scaly  appearance because the epidermis becomes lacerated or torn into small  irregular fragments which adhere and seem to overlap like shingles on a  roof. The flesh is firm, white, and has a farinaceous taste as well as  odor. The gills are white, becoming red or rusty spotted, rather close,  and notched. The stem is solid, firm, nearly equal, except slightly  swollen at the base, colored much like the cap but usually paler. When  old it is sometimes hollow on account of the insects mining it. The  spores are white and elliptical, .00025 inch long.    I found this mushroom near Salem, Ohio, Bowling Green, Ohio, and on  Ralston's Run near Chillicothe. Found in mixed woods from September to  November.      _Tricholoma terriferum. Pk._    THE EARTH-BEARING TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    Terriferum, earth-bearing, alluding to the viscid cap's holding  particles of loam and pine needles to it as it breaks through the soil.  This is a meaty mushroom, and when properly cleaned makes an appetizing  dish.    The pileus is convex, irregular, wavy on the margin and rolled inward,  smooth, viscid, pale yellow, sometimes whitish, generally covered with  loam on account of the sticky surface of the cap, flesh white.    The gills are white, thin, close, slightly adnexed.    The stem is short, fleshy, solid, equal, mealy, very slightly bulbous at  the base.    Found near Salem, Ohio, on Hon. J. Thwing Brooks' farm September to  October.      _Tricholoma fumidellum. Pk._    THE SMOKY TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    Fumidellum--smoky, because of the clay-colored caps clouded with brown.    The pileus is one to two inches broad, convex, then expanded,  subumbonate, bare, moist, dingy-white or clay-color clouded with brown,  the disk or umbo generally smoky brown.    The gills are crowded, subventricose, whitish.    The stem is one and a half to two and a half inches long, equal, bare,  solid whitish. The spores minute, subglobose, 4-5x4u. _Peck_, 44 Rep.    The specimens I found grew in a mixed woods in the leaf-mold. They are  found only occasionally in our woods in September and October.      _Tricholoma leucocephalum. Fr._    THE WHITE-CAPPED TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.    Leucocephalum is from two Greek words meaning white and head, referring  to the white caps.    The pileus is one and a half to two inches across, convex, then plane;  even, moist, smooth when the silky veil is gone, water-soaked after a  rain; flesh thin, tough, smell mealy, taste mild and pleasant.    The gills are rounded behind and almost free, crowded, "]]]
