These  moderns only die daily without power to rise from the dead. But I can  truly claim that in coming into some of these more stable cities of the  States I felt something quite sincerely of that historic emotion which  is satisfied in the eternal cities of the Mediterranean. I felt in  America what many Americans suppose can only be felt in Europe. I have  seldom had that sentiment stirred more simply and directly than when I  saw from afar off, above the vast grey labyrinth of Philadelphia, great  Penn upon his pinnacle like the graven figure of a god who had fashioned  a new world; and remembered that his body lay buried in a field at the  turning of a lane, a league from my own door.    For this aspect of America is rather neglected in the talk about  electricity and headlines. Needless to say, the modern vulgarity of  avarice and advertisement sprawls all over Philadelphia or Boston; but  so it does over Winchester or Canterbury. But most people know that  there is something else to be found in Canterbury or Winchester; many  people know that it is rather more interesting; and some people know  that Alfred can still walk in Winchester and that St. Thomas at  Canterbury was killed but did not die. It is at least as possible for a  Philadelphian to feel the presence of Penn and Franklin as for an  Englishman to see the ghosts of Alfred and of Becket. Tradition does not  mean a dead town; it does not mean that the living are dead but that the  dead are alive. It means that it still matters what Penn did two hundred  years ago or what Franklin did a hundred years ago; I never could feel  in New York that it mattered what anybody did an hour ago. And these  things did and do matter. Quakerism is not my favourite creed; but on  that day when William Penn stood unarmed upon that spot and made his  treaty with the Red Indians, his creed of humanity did have a triumph  and a triumph that has not turned back. The praise given to him is not a  priggish fiction of our conventional history, though such fictions have  illogically curtailed it. The Nonconformists have been rather unfair to  Penn even in picking their praises; and they generally forget that  toleration cuts both ways and that an open mind is open on all sides.  Those who deify him for consenting to bargain with the savages cannot  forgive him for consenting to bargain with the Stuarts. And the same is  true of the other city, yet more closely connected with the tolerant  experiment of the Stuarts. The state of Maryland was the first  experiment in religious freedom in human history. Lord Baltimore and his  Catholics were a long march ahead of William Penn and his Quakers on  what is now called the path of progress. That the first religious  toleration ever granted in the world was granted by Roman Catholics is  one of those little informing details with which our Victorian histories  did not exactly teem. But when I went into my hotel at Baltimore and  found two priests waiting to see me, I was moved in a new fashion, for I  felt that I touched the end of a living chain. Nor was the impression  accidental; it will always remain with me with a mixture of gratitude  and grief, for they brought a message of welcome from a great American  whose name I had known from childhood and whose career was drawing to  its close; for it was but a few days after I left the city that I  learned that Cardinal Gibbons was dead.    On the top of a hill on one side of the town stood the first monument  raised after the Revolution to Washington. Beyond it was a new monument  saluting in the name of Lafayette the American soldiers who fell  fighting in France in the Great War. Between them were steps and stone  seats, and I sat down on one of them and talked to two children who were  clambering about the bases of the monument. I felt a profound and  radiant peace in the thought that they at any rate were not going to my  lecture. It made me happy that in that talk neither they nor I had any  names. I was full of that indescribable waking vision of the strangeness  of life, and especially of the strangeness of locality; of how we find  places and lose them; and see faces for a moment in a far-off land, and  it is equally mysterious if we remember and mysterious if we forget. I  had even stirring in my head the suggestion of some verses that I shall  never finish--           If I ever go back to Baltimore       The city of Maryland.      But the poem would have to contain far too much; for I was thinking of a  thousand things at once; and wondering what the children would be like  twenty years after and whether they would travel in white goods or be  interested in oil, and I was not untouched (it may be said) by the fact  that a neighbouring shop had provided the only sample of the substance  called 'tea' ever found on the American continent; and in front of me  soared up into the sky on wings of stone the column of all those high  hopes of humanity a hundred years ago; and beyond there were lighted  candles in the chapels and prayers in the ante-chambers, where perhaps  already a Prince of the Church was dying. Only on a later page can I  even attempt to comb out such a tangle of contrasts, which is indeed the  tangle of America and this mortal life; but sitting there on that stone  seat under that quiet sky, I had some experience of the thronging  thousands of living thoughts and things, noisy and numberless as birds,  that give its everlasting vivacity and vitality to a dead town.    Two other cities I visited which have this particular type of  traditional character, the one being typical of the North and the other  of the South. At least I may take as convenient anti-types the towns of  Boston and St. Louis; and we might add Nashville as being a shade more  truly southern than St. Louis. To the extreme South, in the sense of  what is called the Black Belt, I never went at all. Now English  travellers expect the South to be somewhat traditional; but they are not  prepared for the aspects of Boston in the North which are even more so.  If we wished only for an antic of antithesis, we might say that on one  side the places are more prosaic than the names and on the other the  names are more prosaic than the places. St. Louis is a fine town, and we  recognise a fine instinct of the imagination that set on the hill  overlooking the river the statue of that holy horseman who has  christened the city. But the city is not as beautiful as its name; it  could not be. Indeed these titles set up a standard to which the most  splendid spires and turrets could not rise, and below which the  commercial chimneys and sky-signs conspicuously sink. We should think it  odd if Belfast had borne the name of Joan of Arc. We should be slightly  shocked if the town of Johannesburg happened to be called Jesus Christ.  But few have noted a blasphemy, or even a somewhat challenging  benediction, to be found in the very name of San Francisco.    But on the other hand a place like Boston is much more beautiful than  its name. And, as I have suggested, an Englishman's general information,  or lack of information, leaves him in some ignorance of the type of  beauty that turns up in that type of place. He has heard so much about  the purely commercial North as against the agricultural and  aristocratic South, and the traditions of Boston and Philadelphia are  rather too tenuous and delicate to be seen from across the Atlantic. But  here also there are traditions and a great deal of traditionalism. The  circle of old families, which still meets with a certain exclusiveness  in Philadelphia, is the sort of thing that we in England should expect  to find rather in New Orleans. The academic aristocracy of Boston, which  Oliver Wendell Holmes called the Brahmins, is still a reality though it  was always a minority and is now a very small minority. An epigram,  invented by Yale at the expense of Harvard, describes it as very small  indeed:--           Here is to jolly old Boston, the home of the bean and the cod,       Where Cabots speak only to Lowells, and Lowells speak only to God.      But an aristocracy must be a minority, and it is arguable that the  smaller it is the better. I am bound to say, however, that the  distinguished Dr. Cabot, the present representative of the family, broke  through any taboo that may tie his affections to his Creator and to Miss  Amy Lowell, and broadened his sympathies so indiscriminately as to show  kindness and hospitality to so lost a being as an English lecturer. But  if the thing is hardly a limit it is very living as a memory; and Boston  on this side is very much a place of memories. It would be paying it a  very poor compliment merely to say that parts of it reminded me of  England; for indeed they reminded me of English things that have largely  vanished from England. There are old brown houses in the corners of  squares and streets that are like glimpses of a man's forgotten  childhood; and when I saw the long path with posts where the Autocrat  may be supposed to have walked with the schoolmistress, I felt I had  come to the land where old tales come true.    I pause in this place upon this particular aspect of America because it  is very much missed in a mere contrast with England. I need not say that  if I felt it even about slight figures of fiction, I felt it even more  about solid figures of history. Such ghosts seemed particularly solid in  the Southern States, precisely because of the comparative quietude and  leisure of the atmosphere of the South. It was never more vivid to me  than when coming in, at a quiet hour of the night, into the  comparatively quiet hotel at Nashville in Tennessee, and mounting to a  dim and deserted upper floor where I found myself before a faded  picture; and from the dark canvas looked forth the face of Andrew  Jackson, watchful like a white eagle.

I cannot say good-bye to him forever without a word concerning his  personal existence, as incomprehensible to the practical as his social  dreams perhaps. He had strong love of home and children; and once he  said, the tone touched with melancholy: \"It used to pain me to think  that I should die and have no son; but now I am contented that I have no  son.\" One knew it was the wrenching cough that made him \"contented.\" A  practical man would have rejoiced to be guiltless of transmitting the  inheritance, but one could see the dreamer grieved. His eyes would grow  humid looking at his little daughters; and indeed they were bright,  beautiful children, though not like him. In his early wanderings he had  met and loved a simple peasant woman, unlettered, but with sound and  serviceable common sense, and with the beauty of perfect honesty shining  in her big Norse-blue eyes. It was then and it is now a wonder to me how  in that mystical brain of his, replete with abstractions,  generalizations, idealizations, he placed his love for wife and  children; strong and tender as it was, one could appreciate at once that  he had no sense of the burden of practical life which his wife seemed to  have taken up as naturally hers. The whole world of the imagination  wherein he so constantly moved seemed entirely without her ken, yet this  did not seem to trouble either. Nor did the fact that his unworldliness  doubled her portion of responsibility seem to cause him to reflect that  she was kept too busy, like Martha of old, to \"choose that good part\"  which he had chosen. Thinking of it now, still with some sense of  puzzlement, I believe his love for human creatures, and especially  within the family relation, were of that deep, still, yearning kind we  feel towards the woods and hills of home; the silent, unobtrusive  presence fills us with rest and certainty, and we are all unease when we  miss it; yet we take it for granted, and seldom dwell upon it in our  active thoughts, or realize the part it plays in us; it belongs to the  dark wells of being.

EVERY occupant of the ramshackle, old-fashioned studio building on  Broadway knew old Melville, the landscape painter, who had roughed life  within its dilapidated walls for more than a score of years. In former  years the studio building had been quite fashionable and respectable;  there is hardly a painter of reputation in New York to-day who has not,  once in his life, occupied a room on the top floor. But in these days of  \"modern improvements,\" of running water and steam heat, of elevators and  electric lights, it has lost its standing and is inhabited by a rather  precarious and suspicious clan of pseudo artists, mountebanks who  vegetate on the outskirts of art; \"buckeye painters,\" who turn out a  dozen 20x30 canvases a day for the export trade to Africa and Australia;  unscrupulous fabricators of Corots and Daubignys, picture drummers who  make such rascality profitable, illustrators of advertising pamphlets,  and so-called frescoe painters, who ornament ceilings with sentimental  clouds, with two or three cupids thrown in according to the price they  extort from ignorant parvenues.    And yet, no matter on what by-roads these soldiers of fortune wandered  to earn their dubious livelihood, they all respected the white-bearded  tenant, in his shabby gray suit, a suit which he wore at all seasons,  and which time seemed to have treated just as unkindly as the bent and  emaciated form of its wearer. Old Melville gave offense to nobody, and  always had a pleasant word for everybody, but, as he was not talkative,  and the other tenants were too busy to bother an old man painting,  nobody knew much about his mode of living, the standard of his art, or  his past history.    Very few had ever entered his studio--he had neither patrons nor  intimate friends--and very likely they would not have enjoyed their  visit. A peculiar gloomy atmosphere pervaded the room, almost sickening  in its frugality, and as its skylight lay north, the sun never touched  it. It had something chilly and uncanny about it even in summer. The  floor was bare, furniture there was none, except an old worn-out kitchen  table and chair, an easel and an old box which served as a bookcase for  a few ragged unbound volumes. The comfort of a bed was an unknown luxury  to him; he slept on the floor, on a mattress which in daytime was hidden  with his scant wardrobe and cooking utensils in a corner, behind a gray  faded curtain. His pictures, simple pieces of canvas with tattered  edges, nailed to the four walls, leaving hardly an inch uncovered, were  the only decoration and furnished a most peculiar wall paper, which  heightened the dreariness of the room.    There was after all a good deal of merit to old Melville's landscapes;  on an average they were much better than many of those hung \"on the  line\"; the only disagreeable quality was their sombreness of tone. He  invariably got them hopelessly muddy in color, despite their resembling  the color dreams of a young impressionist painter at the start. He  worked at them so long until they became blurred and blotchy, dark like  his life, a sad reflection of his unprofitable career.    It was nearly thirty years ago that he had left his native town and had  come to New York as a boy of sixteen. He already knew something of life  then; at an early age he had been obliged to help to support his family,  and had served an apprenticeship as printer and sign painter. In New  York he determined to become an artist: a landscape painter, who would  paint sunshine as had never been done before; but many years elapsed  before he could pursue his ambition. Any amount of obstacles were put in  his way. He had married and had children, and could only paint in  leisure hours, all his other time being taken up in the endeavor to  provide for his family, by inferior work, inferior decoration, etc. Not  before years of incessant vicissitudes, heart-rending domestic troubles  and sorrow, not before his poor wife had died of consumption--that awful  day when he had to run about all day in the rain to borrow money enough  to bury her!--and his children had been put in a charitable institution,  he took up painting as a profession. Then the hard times, which are  proverbial with struggling artists without means, began; only they were  easier to bear, as he was suffering alone. In days of dispossess and  starvation he had at least his art to console him, and he remained true  to her in all those years of misery, and never degraded himself again to  \"pot boiling.\" In hours of despair, he also tried his hand at it, but  simply \"couldn't do it.\" Now and then he had a stroke of luck, a  moderate success, but popularity and fame would not come. His pictures  were steadily refused by the Academy. Every year he made a new effort,  but in vain.    One day, when one of his large pictures was exhibited in the show window  of a fashionable art store, a rich collector stepped out of his carriage  and, entering the store, asked, \"How much do you want for the Inness you  have in the window?\" The picture dealer answered, \"It is no Inness, but  just as good a piece of work.\" \"No Inness!\" ejaculated the man who  wanted to buy a name, \"then I don't want it,\" and abruptly left the  store. This event, trifling as it was, threw a pale halo over old  Melville's whole life and gave him strength to overcome many a severe  trial. He hoped on, persevering in his grim fight for existence, despite  failures and humiliation.    But the years passed by, and he still sat there in his studio, and in  its emptiness, its walls covered with his dark and unsold pictures,  whose tone seemed to grow darker with every year. He was one of those  sensitive beings who continually suffer from the harsh realities of  life, who are as naive as children, and therefore as easily  disillusionized, and nevertheless cannot renounce their belief in the  ideal. Not a day passed that he did not sit several hours before his  easel, trying to paint sunshine as it really is. Nobody in this busy  world, however, took notice of his efforts or comprehended the pathos of  old Melville's life, those fifty years of bad luck. And yet such  martyr-like devotion to art, such a glorious lifelong struggle against  fate and circumstances, is so rare in modern times that one might expect  the whole world to talk about it in astonished admiration.    And how did he manage to get along all this time, these twenty-five  years or more, since \"pot boiling\" had become an unpardonable crime to  him? Now and then he borrowed a dollar or so, that lasted him for quite  a while, as his wants were almost reduced to nothing. Of course he was  always behind in the rent, but as he sometimes sold a sketch, he managed  somehow to keep his studio. He did not eat more than once a day. \"Too  much eating is of no use,\" he consoled himself, and in this respect he  had many colleagues in the fraternity of art, as more than one-half of  our artists do not manage to get enough to eat, which fact may explain  why many paint so insipidly.    A few days before his sudden death, an old gentleman, a chance  acquaintance, was talking with him about the muddy coloring of the  pictures. Old Melville's eyes wandered over the four walls representing  a life's work; at first he ardently argued in their favor, but finally  gave in that they, perhaps, were a little bit too dark. \"Why do you not  take a studio where you can see real sunlight; there is one empty now  with Southern exposure, right in this building.\" Old Melville shook his  head, murmuring some excuses of \"can't afford it,\" of \"being used so  long to this one,\" but his visitor insisted, \"he"]]]
