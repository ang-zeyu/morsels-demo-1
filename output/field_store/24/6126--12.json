All the thanks  he got was a furious look from Felicity, but Peg had not heard him and  now she turned her attention to Cecily.    \"You look delicate. I daresay you'll never live to grow up.\"    Cecily's lip trembled and Dan's face turned crimson.    \"Shut up,\" he said to Peg. \"You've no business to say such things to  people.\"    I think my jaw dropped. I know Peter's and Felix's did. Felicity broke  in wildly.    \"Oh, don't mind him, Miss Bowen. He's got SUCH a temper--that's just the  way he talks to us all at home. PLEASE excuse him.\"    \"Bless you, I don't mind him,\" said Peg, from whom the unexpected seemed  to be the thing to expect. \"I like a lad of spurrit. And so your father  run away, did he, Peter? He used to be a beau of mine--he seen me home  three times from singing school when we was young. Some folks said he  did it for a dare. There's such a lot of jealousy in the world, ain't  there? Do you know where he is now?\"    \"No,\" said Peter.    \"Well, he's coming home before long,\" said Peg mysteriously.    \"Who told you that?\" cried Peter in amazement.    \"Better not ask,\" responded Peg, looking up at the skull.    If she meant to make the flesh creep on our bones she succeeded. But  now, much to our relief, the meal was over and Peg invited us to draw  our chairs up to the stove again.    \"Make yourselves at home,\" she said, producing her pipe from her pocket.  \"I ain't one of the kind who thinks their houses too good to live in.  Guess I won't bother washing the dishes. They'll do yez for breakfast if  yez don't forget your places. I s'pose none of yez smokes.\"    \"No,\" said Felicity, rather primly.    \"Then yez don't know what's good for yez,\" retorted Peg, rather  grumpily. But a few whiffs of her pipe placated her and, observing  Cecily sigh, she asked her kindly what was the matter.    \"I'm thinking how worried they'll be at home about us,\" explained  Cecily.    \"Bless you, dearie, don't be worrying over that. I'll send them word  that yez are all snug and safe here.\"    \"But how can you?\" cried amazed Cecily.    \"Better not ask,\" said Peg again, with another glance at the skull.    An uncomfortable silence followed, finally broken by Peg, who introduced  her pets to us and told how she had come by them. The black cat was her  favourite.    \"That cat knows more than I do, if yez'll believe it,\" she said proudly.  \"I've got a rat too, but he's a bit shy when strangers is round. Your  cat got all right again that time, didn't he?\"    \"Yes,\" said the Story Girl.    \"Thought he would,\" said Peg, nodding sagely. \"I seen to that. Now,  don't yez all be staring at the hole in my dress.\"    \"We weren't,\" was our chorus of protest.    \"Looked as if yez were. I tore that yesterday but I didn't mend it. I  was brought up to believe that a hole was an accident but a patch was a  disgrace. And so your Aunt Olivia is going to be married after all?\"    This was news to us. We felt and looked dazed.    \"I never heard anything of it,\" said the Story Girl.    \"Oh, it's true enough. She's a great fool. I've no faith in husbands.  But one good thing is she ain't going to marry that Henry Jacobs of  Markdale. He wants her bad enough. Just like his presumption,--thinking  himself good enough for a King. His father is the worst man alive. He  chased me off his place with his dog once. But I'll get even with him  yet.\"    Peg looked very savage, and visions of burned barns floated through our  minds.    \"He'll be punished in hell, you know,\" said Peter timidly.    \"But I won't be there to see that,\" rejoined Peg. \"Some folks say I'll  go there because I don't go to church oftener. But I don't believe it.\"    \"Why don't you go?\" asked Peter, with a temerity that bordered on  rashness.    \"Well, I've got so sunburned I'm afraid folks might take me for an  Injun,\" explained Peg, quite seriously. \"Besides, your minister makes  such awful long prayers. Why does he do it?\"    \"I suppose he finds it easier to talk to God than to people,\" suggested  Peter reflectively.    \"Well, anyway, I belong to the round church,\" said Peg comfortably, \"and  so the devil can't catch ME at the corners. I haven't been to Carlisle  church for over three years. I thought I'd a-died laughing the last time  I was there. Old Elder Marr took up the collection that day. He'd on a  pair of new boots and they squeaked all the way up and down the aisles.  And every time the boots squeaked the elder made a face, like he had  toothache. It was awful funny. How's your missionary quilt coming on,  Cecily?\"    Was there anything Peg didn't know?    \"Very well,\" said Cecily.    \"You can put my name on it, if you want to.\"    \"Oh, thank you. Which section--the five-cent one or the ten-cent one?\"  asked Cecily timidly.    \"The ten-cent one, of course. The best is none too good for me. I'll  give you the ten cents another time. I'm short of change just now--not  being as rich as Queen Victory. There's her picture up there--the one  with the blue sash and diamint crown and the lace curting on her head.  Can any of yez tell me this--is Queen Victory a married woman?\"    \"Oh, yes, but her husband is dead,\" answered the Story Girl.    \"Well, I s'pose they couldn't have called her an old maid, seeing she  was a queen, even if she'd never got married. Sometimes I sez to myself,  'Peg, would you like to be Queen Victory?' But I never know what  to answer. In summer, when I can roam anywhere in the woods and the  sunshine--I wouldn't be Queen Victory for anything. But when it's winter  and cold and I can't git nowheres--I feel as if I wouldn't mind changing  places with her.\"    Peg put her pipe back in her mouth and began to smoke fiercely. The  candle wick burned long, and was topped by a little cap of fiery red  that seemed to wink at us like an impish gnome. The most grotesque  shadow of Peg flickered over the wall behind her. The one-eyed cat  remitted his grim watch and went to sleep. Outside the wind screamed  like a ravening beast at the window. Suddenly Peg removed her pipe from  her mouth, bent forward, gripped my wrist with her sinewy fingers until  I almost cried out with pain, and gazed straight into my face. I felt  horribly frightened of her. She seemed an entirely different creature. A  wild light was in her eyes, a furtive, animal-like expression was on  her face. When she spoke it was in a different voice and in different  language.    \"Do you hear the wind?\" she asked in a thrilling whisper. \"What IS the  wind? What IS the wind?\"    \"I--I--don't know,\" I stammered.    \"No more do I,\" said Peg, \"and nobody knows. Nobody knows what the wind  is. I wish I could find out. I mightn't be so afraid of the wind if I  knew what it was. I am afraid of it. When the blasts come like that I  want to crouch down and hide me. But I can tell you one thing about the  wind--it's the only free thing in the world--THE--ONLY--FREE--THING.  Everything else is subject to some law, but the wind is FREE. It bloweth  where it listeth and no man can tame it. It's free--that's why I  love it, though I'm afraid of it. It's a grand thing to be free--free  free--free!\"    Peg's voice rose almost to a shriek. We were dreadfully frightened, for  we knew there were times when she was quite crazy and we feared one of  her \"spells\" was coming on her. But with a swift movement she turned  the man's coat she wore up over her shoulders and head like a hood,  completely hiding her face. Then she crouched forward, elbows on knees,  and relapsed into silence. None of us dared speak or move. We sat thus  for half an hour. Then Peg jumped up and said briskly in her usual tone,    \"Well, I guess yez are all sleepy and ready for bed. You girls can sleep  in my bed over there, and I'll take the sofy. Yez can put the cat off if  yez like, though he won't hurt yez. You boys can go downstairs. There's  a big pile of straw there that'll do yez for a bed, if yez put your  coats on. I'll light yez down, but I ain't going to leave yez a light  for fear yez'd set fire to the place.\"    Saying good-night to the girls, who looked as if they thought their last  hour was come, we went to the lower room. It was quite empty, save for a  pile of fire wood and another of clean straw. Casting a stealthy glance  around, ere Peg withdrew the light, I was relieved to see that there  were no skulls in sight. We four boys snuggled down in the straw. We did  not expect to sleep, but we were very tired and before we knew it our  eyes were shut, to open no more till morning. The poor girls were not  so fortunate. They always averred they never closed an eye. Four things  prevented them from sleeping. In the first place Peg snored loudly; in  the second place the fitful gleams of firelight kept flickering over the  skull for half the night and making gruesome effects on it; in the third  place Peg's pillows and bedclothes smelled rankly of tobacco smoke; and  in the fourth place they were afraid the rat Peg had spoken of might  come out to make their acquaintance. Indeed, they were sure they heard  him skirmishing about several times.    When we wakened in the morning the storm was over and a young morning  was looking through rosy eyelids across a white world. The little  clearing around Peg's cabin was heaped with dazzling drifts, and we  boys fell to and shovelled out a road to her well. She gave us  breakfast--stiff oatmeal porridge without milk, and a boiled egg apiece.  Cecily could NOT eat her porridge; she declared she had such a bad  cold that she had no appetite; a cold she certainly had; the rest of us  choked our messes down and after we had done so Peg asked us if we had  noticed a soapy taste.    \"The soap fell into the porridge while I was making it,\" she said.  \"But,\"--smacking her lips,--\"I'm going to make yez an Irish stew for  dinner. It'll be fine.\"    An Irish stew concocted by Peg! No wonder Dan said hastily, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31619"],[0,"The Planet Savers (#13)"],[1,"unaccustomed surge of emotion, he wished he were with the  others. Kendricks, now. Jay knew, precisely, why Forth had sent the big,  reliable spaceman at his back. And that handsome, arrogant  Darkovan--where was he? Jay looked at the girl in puzzlement; he didn't  want to reveal that he wasn't quite sure of what he was saying or doing,  or that he had little memory of what Jason had been up to.    He started to ask, \"Where did the Hastur kid go?\" before a vagrant  logical thought told him that such an important guest would have been  lodged with the Old One. Then a wave of despair hit him; Jay realized he  did not even speak the trailmen's language, that it had slipped from his  thoughts completely.    [Illustration: She felt a touch of panic. He was leaving her again.]    \"You--\" he fished desperately for the girl's name, \"Kyla. You don't  speak the trailmen's language, do you?\"    \"A few words. No more. Why?\" She had withdrawn into a corner of the tiny  room--still not far from him--and he wondered remotely what his damned  alter ego had been up to. With Jason, there was no telling. Jay raised  his eyes with a melancholy smile.    \"Sit down, child. You needn't be frightened.\"    \"I'm--I'm trying to understand--\" the girl touched him again, evidently  trying to conquer her terror. \"It isn't easy--when you turn into someone  else under my eyes--\" Jay saw that she was shaking in real fright.    He said wearily, \"I'm not going to--to turn into a bat and fly away. I'm  just a poor devil of a doctor who's gotten himself into one unholy  mess.\" There was no reason, he was thinking, to take out his own misery  and despair by shouting at this poor kid. God knew what she'd been  through with his irresponsible other self--Forth had admitted that that  damned \"Jason\" personality was a blend of all the undesirable traits  he'd fought to smother all his life. By an effort of will he kept  himself from pulling away from her hand on his shoulder.    \"Jason, don't--slip away like that! _Think!_ Try to keep hold on  _yourself_!\"    Jay propped his head in his hands, trying to make sense of that.  Certainly in the dim light she could not be too conscious of subtle  changes of expression. She evidently thought she was talking to Jason.  She didn't seem to be overly intelligent.    \"Think about tomorrow, Jason. What are you going to say to him? Think  about your parents--\"    Jay Allison wondered what they would think when they found a stranger  here. He felt like a stranger. Yet he must have come, tonight, into this  house and spoken--he rummaged desperately in his mind for some fragments  of the trailmen's language. He had spoken it as a child. He must recall  enough to speak to the woman who had been a kind foster-mother to her  alien son. He tried to form his lips to the unfamiliar shapes of words...    Jay covered his face with his hands again. Jason was the part of himself  that remembered the trailmen. _That_ was what he had to remember--Jason  was not a hostile stranger, not an alien intruder in his body. Jason was  a lost part of himself and at the moment a damn necessary part. If there  were only some way to get back the Jason memories, skills, without  losing _himself_ ... he said to the girl, \"Let me think. Let me--\" to  his surprise and horror his voice broke into an alien tongue, \"Let me  alone, will you?\"    Maybe, Jay thought, I could stay myself if I could remember the rest.  Dr. Forth said: Jason would remember the trailmen with kindness, not  dislike.    Jay searched his memory and found nothing but familiar frustration;  years spent in an alien land, apart from a human heritage, stranded and  abandoned. _My father left me. He crashed the plane and I never saw him  again and I hate him for leaving me ..._    But his father had not abandoned him. He had crashed the plane trying to  save them both. It was no one's fault--    _Except my father's. For trying to fly over the Hellers into a country  where no man belongs ..._    He hadn't belonged. And yet the trailmen, whom he considered little  better than roaming beasts, had taken the alien child into their city,  their homes, their hearts. They had loved him. And he ...           *       *       *       *       *    \"And I loved them,\" I found myself saying half aloud, then realized that  Kyla was gripping my arm, looking up imploringly into my face. I shook  my head rather groggily. \"What's the matter?\"    \"You frightened me,\" she said in a shaky little voice, and I suddenly  knew what had happened. I tensed with savage rage against Jay Allison.  He couldn't even give me the splinter of life I'd won for myself, but  had to come sneaking out of my mind, how he must hate me! Not half as  much as I hated him, damn him! Along with everything else, he'd scared  Kyla half to death!    She was kneeling very close to me, and I realized that there was one way  to fight that cold austere fish of a Jay Allison, send him shrieking  down into hell again. He was a man who hated everything except the cold  world he'd made his life. Kyla's face was lifted, soft and intent and  pleading, and suddenly I reached out and pulled her to me and kissed  her, hard.    \"Could a ghost do this?\" I demanded, \"or this?\"    She whispered, \"No--oh, no,\" and her arms went up to lock around my  neck. As I pulled her down on the sweet-smelling moss that carpeted the  chamber, I felt the dark ghost of my other self thin out, vanish and  disappear.    Regis had been right. It had been the only way ...           *       *       *       *       *    The Old One was not old at all; the title was purely ceremonial. This  one was young--not much older than I--but he had poise and dignity and  the same strange indefinable quality I had recognized in Regis Hastur.  It was something, I supposed, that the Terran Empire had lost in  spreading from star to star. A feeling of knowing one's own place, a  dignity that didn't demand recognition because it had never lacked for  it.    Like all trailmen he had the chinless face and lobeless ears, the  heavy-haired body which looked slightly less than human. He spoke very  low--the trailmen have very acute hearing--and I had to strain my ears  to listen, and remember to keep my own voice down.    He stretched his hand to me, and I lowered my head over it and murmured,  \"I take submission, Old One.\"    \"Never mind that,\" he said in his gentle twittering voice, \"sit down, my  son. You are welcome here, but I feel you have abused our trust in you.  We dismissed you to your own kind because we felt you would be happier  so. Did we show you anything but kindness, that after so many years you  return with armed men?\"    The reproof in his red eyes was hardly an auspicious beginning. I said  helplessly, \"Old One, the men with me are not armed. A band of  those-who-may-not-enter-cities attacked us, and we defended ourselves. I  travelled with so many men only because I feared to travel the passes  alone.\"    \"But does that explain why you have returned at all?\" The reason and  reproach in his voice made sense.    Finally I said, \"Old One, we come as suppliants. My people appeal to  your people in the hope that you will be--\" I started to say, _as  human_, stopped and amended \"--that you will deal as kindly with them as  with me.\"    His face betrayed nothing. \"What do you ask?\"    I explained. I told it badly, stumbling, not knowing the technical  terms, knowing they had no equivalents anyway in the trailmen's  language. He listened, asking a penetrating question now and again. When  I mentioned the Terran Legate's offer to recognize the trailmen as a  separate and independent government, he frowned and rebuked me:    \"We of the Sky People have no dealings with the Terrans, and care  nothing for their recognition--or its lack.\"    For that I had no answer, and the Old One continued, kindly but  indifferently, \"We do not like to think that the fever which is a  children's little sickness with us shall kill so many of your kind. But  you cannot in all honesty blame us. You cannot say that we spread the  disease; we never go beyond the mountains. Are we to blame that the  winds change or the moons come together in the sky? When the time has  come for men to die, they die.\" He stretched his hand in dismissal. \"I  will give your men safe-conduct to the river, Jason. Do not return.\"    Regis Hastur rose suddenly and faced him. \"Will you hear me, Father?\" He  used the ceremonial title without hesitation, and the Old One said in  distress, \"The son of Hastur need never speak as a suppliant to the Sky  People!\"    \"Nevertheless, hear me as a suppliant, Father,\" Regis said quietly. \"It  is not the strangers and aliens of Terra who are pleading. We have  learned one thing from the strangers of Terra, which you have not yet  learned. I am young and it is not fitting that I should teach you, but  you have said; are we to blame that the moons come together in the sky?  No. But we have learned from the Terrans not to blame the moons in the  sky for our own ignorance of the ways of the Gods--by which I mean the  ways of sickness or poverty or misery.\"    \"These are strange words for a Hastur,\" said the Old One, displeased.    \"These are strange times for a Hastur,\" said Regis loudly. The Old One  winced, and Regis moderated his tone, but continued vehemently, \"You  blame the moons in the sky. _I_ say the moons are not to blame--nor the  winds--nor the Gods. The Gods send these things to men to test their  wits and to find if they have the will to master them!\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Old One's forehead ridged vertically and he said with stinging  contempt, \"Is this the breed of king which men call Hastur now?\"    \"Man or God or Hastur, I am not too proud to plead for my people,\"  retorted Regis, flushing with anger. \"Never in all the history of  Darkover has a Hastur stood before one of you and begged--\"    \"--for the men from another world.\"    \"--for all"]]]
