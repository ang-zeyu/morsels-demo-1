On this occasion both  the corona and a red projection were noted. Halley further makes  allusion to that curious phenomenon, which later on became celebrated  under the name of \"Baily's beads.\" It was also on the occasion of this  eclipse that the _earliest recorded drawings of the corona_ were made.  Cambridge happened to be within the track of totality; and a certain  Professor Cotes of that University, who is responsible for one of the  drawings in question, forwarded them to Sir Isaac Newton together with a  letter describing his observations.    In 1724 there occurred an eclipse, the total phase of which was visible  from the south-west of England, but not from London. The weather was  unfavourable, and the eclipse consequently appears to have been seen by  only one person, a certain Dr. Stukeley, who observed it from Haraden  Hill near Salisbury Plain. This is the last eclipse of which the total  phase was seen in any part of England. The next will not be until June  29, 1927, and will be visible along a line across North Wales and  Lancashire. The discs of the sun and moon will just then be almost of  the same apparent size, and so totality will be of extremely short  duration; in fact only a few seconds. London itself will not see a  totality until the year 2151--a circumstance which need hardly distress  any of us personally!    It is only from the early part of the nineteenth century that serious  scientific attention to eclipses of the sun can be dated. An _annular_  eclipse, visible in 1836 in the south of Scotland, drew the careful  notice of Francis Baily of Jedburgh in Roxburghshire to that curious  phenomenon which we have already described, and which has ever since  been known by the name of \"Baily's beads.\" Spurred by his observation,  the leading astronomers of the day determined to pay particular  attention to a total eclipse, which in the year 1842 was to be visible  in the south of France and the north of Italy. The public interest  aroused on this occasion was also very great, for the region across  which the track of totality was to pass was very populous, and inhabited  by races of a high degree of culture.    This eclipse occurred on the morning of the 8th July, and from it may be  dated that great enthusiasm with which total eclipses of the sun have  ever since been received. Airy, our then Astronomer Royal, observed it  from Turin; Arago, the celebrated director of the Paris Observatory,  from Perpignan in the south of France; Francis Baily from Pavia; and Sir  John Herschel from Milan. The corona and three large red prominences  were not only well observed by the astronomers, but drew tremendous  applause from the watching multitudes.    The success of the observations made during this eclipse prompted  astronomers to pay similar attention to that of July 28, 1851, the total  phase of which was to be visible in the south of Norway and Sweden, and  across the east of Prussia. This eclipse was also a success, and it was  now ascertained that the red prominences belonged to the sun and not to  the moon; for the lunar disc, as it moved onward, was seen to cover and  to uncover them in turn. It was also noted that these prominences were  merely uprushes from a layer of glowing gaseous matter, which was seen  closely to envelop the sun.    The total eclipse of July 18, 1860, was observed in Spain, and  photography was for the first time _systematically_ employed in its  observation.[7] In the photographs taken the stationary appearance of  both the corona and prominences with respect to the moving moon,  definitely confirmed the view already put forward that they were actual  appendages of the sun.    The eclipse of August 18, 1868, the total phase of which lasted nearly  six minutes, was visible in India, and drew thither a large concourse of  astronomers. In this eclipse the spectroscope came to the front, and  showed that both the prominences, and the chromospheric layer from which  they rise, are composed of glowing vapours--chief among which is the  vapour of hydrogen. The direct result of the observations made on this  occasion was the spectroscopic method of examining prominences at any  time in full daylight, and without a total eclipse. This method, which  has given such an immense impetus to the study of the sun, was the  outcome of independent and simultaneous investigation on the part of the  French astronomer, the late M. Janssen, and the English astronomer,  Professor (now Sir Norman) Lockyer, a circumstance strangely reminiscent  of the discovery of Neptune. The principles on which the method was  founded seem, however, to have occurred to Dr. (now Sir William) Huggins  some time previously.    The eclipse of December 22, 1870, was total for a little more than two  minutes, and its track passed across the Mediterranean. M. Janssen, of  whom mention has just been made, escaped in a balloon from then besieged  Paris, taking his instruments with him, and made his way to Oran, in  Algeria, in order to observe it; but his expectations were disappointed  by cloudy weather. The expedition sent out from England had the  misfortune to be shipwrecked off the coast of Sicily. But the occasion  was redeemed by a memorable observation made by the American astronomer,  the late Professor Young, which revealed the existence of what is now  known as the \"Reversing Layer.\" This is a shallow layer of gases which  lies immediately beneath the chromosphere. An illustration of the  corona, as it was seen during the above eclipse, will be found on Plate  VII. (A), p. 142.    In the eclipse of December 12, 1871, total across Southern India, the  photographs of the corona obtained by Mr. Davis, assistant to Lord  Lindsay (now the Earl of Crawford), displayed a wealth of detail  hitherto unapproached.    The eclipse of July 29, 1878, total across the western states of North  America, was a remarkable success, and a magnificent view of the corona  was obtained by the well-known American astronomer and physicist, the  late Professor Langley, from the summit of Pike's Peak, Colorado, over  14,000 feet above the level of the sea. The coronal streamers were seen  to extend to a much greater distance at this altitude than at points  less elevated, and the corona itself remained visible during more than  four minutes after the end of totality. It was, however, not entirely a  question of altitude; the coronal streamers were actually very much  longer on this occasion than in most of the eclipses which had  previously been observed.    The eclipse of May 17, 1882, observed in Upper Egypt, is notable from  the fact that, in one of the photographs taken by Dr. Schuster at Sohag,  a bright comet appeared near the outer limit of the corona (see Plate  I., p. 96). The comet in question had not been seen before the eclipse,  and was never seen afterwards. This is the third occasion on which  attention has been drawn to a comet _merely_ by a total eclipse. The  first is mentioned by Seneca; and the second by Philostorgius, in an  account of an eclipse observed at Constantinople in A.D. 418. A fourth  case of the kind occurred in 1893, when faint evidences of one of these  filmy objects were found on photographs of the corona taken by the  American astronomer, Professor Schaeberle, during the total eclipse of  April 16 of that year.    The eclipse of May 6, 1883, had a totality of over five minutes, but  the central track unfortunately passed across the Pacific Ocean, and the  sole point of land available for observing it from was one of the  Marquesas Group, Caroline Island, a coral atoll seven and a half miles  long by one and a half broad. Nevertheless astronomers did not hesitate  to take up their posts upon that little spot, and were rewarded with  good weather.    The next eclipse of importance was that of April 16, 1893. It stretched  from Chili across South America and the Atlantic Ocean to the West Coast  of Africa, and, as the weather was fine, many good results were  obtained. Photographs were taken at both ends of the track, and these  showed that the appearance of the corona remained unchanged during the  interval of time occupied by the passage of the shadow across the earth.  It was on the occasion of this eclipse that Professor Schaeberle found  upon his photographs those traces of the presence of a comet, to which  allusion has already been made.    Extensive preparations were made to observe the eclipse of August 9,  1896. Totality lasted from two to three minutes, and the track stretched  from Norway to Japan. Bad weather disappointed the observers, with the  exception of those taken to Nova Zembla by Sir George Baden Powell in  his yacht _Otaria_.    The eclipse of January 22, 1898, across India _via_ Bombay and Benares,  was favoured with good weather, and is notable for a photograph obtained  by Mrs. E.W. Maunder, which showed a ray of the corona extending to a  most unusual distance.    [Illustration: PLATE I.

(Page 95)]    Of very great influence in the growth of our knowledge with regard to  the sun, is the remarkable piece of good fortune by which the countries  around the Mediterranean, so easy of access, have been favoured with a  comparatively large number of total eclipses during the past sixty  years. Tracks of totality have, for instance, traversed the Spanish  peninsula on no less than five occasions during that period. Two of  these are among the most notable eclipses of recent years, namely, those  of May 28, 1900, and of August 30, 1905.

We are quite close to where Elizabeth  lives, but we should have to cross the river, and it was dark before  we passed her home. I should like to see her but won't get a chance  to. Mrs. Sorenson says she is very happy. In all this round of  exposure the kiddies are as well as can be. Cold, camping, and elk  meat agree with them. We are in a tent for the night, and it is so  cold the ink is freezing, but the kiddies are snuggled under their  blankets as warm as toast. We are to start early in the morning.  Good-night, dear friend. I am glad I can take this trip _for_ you.  You'd freeze.                                  ELINORE STEWART.          XI    BUDDY AND BABY GIRL                                    IN CAMP, October 16, 1914.    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    The day we left the game-warden's was damp and lowering. It didn't  seem it could have one good thing to its credit, but there were  several things to be thankful for. One of them was that you were safe  at home in your warm, dry apartment. We had hardly passed the great  Block buttes when the biggest, wettest flakes of snow began to pelt  into our faces. I really like a storm, and the kiddies would have  enjoyed the snow; but we had to keep the wagon-sheet tied down to keep  the bedding dry, and the kiddies get sick under cover. All the  pleasure I might have had was taken away by the fact that we were  making a forced drive. We _had_ to go. The game-warden had no more  than enough food for his family, and no horse feed. Also, the snow  was almost as deep there as it had been higher up, so the horses could  not graze.    We made it to Cora that day. Here at last was plenty of hay and grain;  we restocked our mess-boxes and felt better toward the world. Next day  we came on here to Newfork, where we are resting our teams before we  start across the desert, which begins just across the creek we are  camped on.    We have added two to our party. I know you will be interested to know  how it happened, and I can picture the astonishment of our neighbors  when we reach home, for our newcomers are to be members of Mrs.  O'Shaughnessy's family. We had all been sorry we could not visit  Elizabeth or \"Danyul\" and his mother. We felt almost as if we were  sneaking past them, but we consoled ourselves with promises to see the  Burneys and Grandma Mortimer. Yesterday the children and I were riding  with Mrs. O'Shaughnessy in the buckboard. We were trotting merrily  along the lane that leads to Newfork, thankful in our hearts to be out  of the snow,--for there is no snow here. Just ahead of us two little  boys were riding along on their ponies. There was a wire fence on both  sides of the lane, and almost at the end of the lane an old cow had  her head between the wires and was nibbling the tall dead grass. The  larger of the two boys said, \"That's old Pendry's cow, and she shan't  eat a blade of grass off Dad's meadow.\"    He rode up to the cow and began beating her with his quirt. That  frightened the cow, and as she jerked her head up, the top wire caught  her across the top of her neck; she jerked and lunged to free herself,  and was cruelly cut by the barbs on the wire. Then he began beating  his pony.    The small boy said, \"You're a coward an' a fool, Billy Polk. The cow  wasn't hurtin' nothin', an' you're just tryin' to show off, beatin'  that pony.\"    Said the other boy, \"Shut up, you beggar, or I'll beat you; an' I'll  take them breeches you got on off you, an' you can go without  any--they're mine. My ma give 'em to you.\"    The little fellow's face was scarlet--as much of it as we could see  for the freckles--and his eyes were blazing as he replied, \"You ain't  man enough. I dare you to strike me or to tech my clothes.\"    Both boys were riding bareback. The small boy slid off his pony's  back; the other rode up to him and raised his quirt, but the little  one seized him by the leg, and in a jiffy they were in the road  fighting like cats. I asked Mrs. O'Shaughnessy to drive on, but she  said, \"If you are in a hurry you can try walkin'; I'm goin' to referee  this scrap.\"    It looked for a minute as if the small boy would get a severe beating,  but by some trick he hurled the other headlong into the green, slimy  water that edged the road; then, seizing the quirt and the opportunity  at the same time, he belabored Billy without mercy as that individual  climbed up the slippery embankment, blubbering and whipped. Still  sobbing, he climbed upon his patient pony, which stood waiting, and  galloped off down the lane. The other pony followed and the little  conqueror was left afoot.    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy was beaming with delight. \"Sure, 'twas a fine  fight, a sight worth coming all this way to see. Ah! but you're the  b'y. 'Tis a dollar I'd be givin' ye, only me purse is in me  stockin'--\"    \"Oh,\" the boy said quickly, \"don't let that stop you. I'll look off  another way.\"    I don't know if she would have given him the money, for just then some  men came into the lane with some cattle and we had to start. The boy  got up on the back end of the buckboard and we drove on. We could hear  our wagons rumbling along and knew they would soon catch up.    \"Where is your home, b'y?\" asked Mrs. O'Shaughnessy.    \"Oh, just wherever Aunt Hettie has work,\" he said. \"She is at Mr.  Tom's now, so I'm there, too,--me and Baby Girl.\"    \"Where are your folks?\" Mrs. O'Shaughnessy went on.    \"Ma's dead, an pa's gone to Alasky. I don't know where my brothers  are. Baby Girl an' me are with Aunt Het, an' that's all there are of  us.\" He grinned cheerfully in spite of the fact that one eye was fast  closing and he bore numerous bumps and scratches on his face and head.    Just then one of the men with the cattle galloped up and shouted,  \"Hello!\" It was Mr. Burney! \"Where'd you get that kid? I guess I'll  have to get the sheriff after you for kidnapping Bud. And what have  you been doing to him, anyway?\"    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy entered delightedly into a recital of the \"mixup,\"  and it turned out that Mr. Tom and Mr. Burney were one. It was like  meeting an old friend; he seemed as pleased as we and insisted on our  going up to his ranch; he said \"the missus\" would feel slighted if we  passed her by. So we turned into another lane, and presently drew up  before the ranch house. \"The missus\" came dancing out to meet us, and  right welcome she made us feel. Mr. Burney went back to bring the  rest, but they were already setting up the tents and had supper almost  ready. However, we stayed and had supper with the Burneys.    They are powerfully happy and talked eagerly of themselves and their  prospects. \"It's just grand to have a home of your own and some one to  do for. I just _love_ to mend for Tommy, but I always hated to mend  before,\" said the missus.    \"You bet,\" Mr. Burney answered, \"it is sure fine to know there's  somebody at home with a pretty pink dress on, waitin' for a fellow  when he comes in from a long day in the saddle.\"    And so they kept up their thoughtless chatter; but every word was as a  stab to poor Aunt Hettie. She had Baby Girl on her lap and was giving  the children their supper, but I noticed that she ate nothing. It was  easy to see that she was not strong. Baby Girl is four years old and  is the fattest little thing. She has very dark blue eyes with long,  black lashes, and the shortest, most turned-up little nose. She is so  plump and rosy that even the faded old blue denim dress could not hide  her loveliness.    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy could not keep her eyes off the children. \"What is  the little girl's name?\" she asked.    \"Caroline Agnes Lucia Lavina Ida Eunice,\" was the astonishing reply.    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy gasped. \"My _goodness_,\" she exclaimed; \"is that  _all_?\"    \"Oh, no,\" Aunt Hettie went on placidly; \"you see, her mother couldn't  call her all the names, so she just used the first letters. They spell  Callie; so that is what she called her. But I don't like the name. I  call her Baby Girl.\"    I asked her how she ever came to name her that way, and she said, \"My  sister wanted a girl, but there were six boys before this little one  came. Each time she hoped it would be a girl, and accordingly selected  a name for a girl. So there were six names saved up, and as there  wasn't much else to give her, my sister gave them _all_ to the baby.\"    After supper the Burneys rode down to camp with us. We had the same  camping ground that we had when we came up. The cabin across the  creek, where we met Grandma Mortimer, is silent and deserted; the  young couple have moved away with their baby.    Mrs. O'Shaughnessy kept talking about the fight, and Mr. Burney gave  us the history of the children. \"Their mother,\" he began, \"has been  dead about eighteen months. She really died with a broken heart. Baby  Girl was only a few weeks old when the father went to Alaska, and I  guess he's dead. He was to 'a' been back in three years, and no one  has ever heard a word from him. His name was Bolton; he was a good  fellow, only he went bughouse over the gold fields and just fretted  till he got away--sold everything for a grub stake--left his wife and  seven kids almost homeless. But they managed some way till the mother  died. With her last breath she asked that the two youngest be kept  together; she knew the oldest ones would have to be separated. She  never did give up looking for Bolton and she wanted him to have the  babies.    \"Her sister Hettie has worked around here for years; her and Rob  Langley have been going to marry ever since I can remember, but always  there has something cropped up. And now that Hettie has got to take  care of the kids I guess they won't never marry; she won't burden him  with them. It is hard for her to support them, too. Work is scarce,  and she can't get it, lots of times, because of the kids.\"    The Burneys soon went home and the rest of us went to bed,--all"]]]
