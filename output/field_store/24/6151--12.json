The balloon careened  over slightly and righted itself. The _High Tariff_ was slowly settling  to the water's surface. As quickly as he could the professor pulled the  boat toward him.    \"You can't. It's anchored,\" cried the girl. She tugged at the rope with  the last strength of hope, and actually brought it up. The skiff yielded  to the professor's clutch. By this time the balloon was so low down that  the aeronaut's feet were nearly in the water.    \"Throw out sand by the handful!\" he ordered. This gentle lighting kept  her at the right elevation.    Now the professor touched the boat. He jumped in. \"Don't talk!\" he  cried, \"hold out your arms instead!\" He knotted the rope underneath her  arms and tied the other end firmly to the ladder.    \"We've got to hurry. Now, Miss! you keep cool, and we'll save you all  right.\" It was a desperate chance.    \"Now let go a couple of sandbags!\" the order came up to Swift in the  car.    Mr. Statis Ticks, with his hand upon the safety-valve, and hearing the  order, became, for the first time in his life, confused. He pulled the  safety-valve wide open, and the gas rushed furiously out. Even with the  two sandbags overboard and lightened of fifty pounds dead weight, the  balloon descended suddenly.    The professor saw the mistake at a glance. He yelled furiously:    \"Good God! Close that valve or we're lost!\"    But the mischief was already done.    \"Heave it all out!\" shrieked the professor, climbing up the ladder like  a cat. The car of the balloon grazed the side of the boat. Mr. Statis  Ticks, in such atonement as he could make for his awful error, reached  over his thin arms. The girl arose, tottering to her feet, and, with a  mighty effort, the gray, gaunt man lifted the heavy girl into the car.  That was the most humane, and, at the same time, the maddest thing he  could have done. Under the influence of the added weight the car struck  the boat, over-turned it, and then dragged in the water.    \"Out with everything!\" howled the professor.    The three looked around in despair. The girl had dropped limp upon the  floor, and the water was upon her. Above them was a cloud of the  darkness of night. Cirrhus clouds scudded here and there in confusion.  There was strange atmospheric howling in the distance, approaching  nearer and nearer. The water assumed that angry hue it takes to itself  before a desperate storm. The monstrous balloon writhed intelligently  above them. All the sandbags were now pitched out. The _High Tariff_  shook itself loose from the water. It rose. It fell. It rose again.    \"Are we safe?\" cried Swift, looking anxiously at the girl.    \"Take off your coat and vest and shoes, everything, and chuck 'em over  like lightning, and we'll see,\" answered the professor, solemnly.          VI.      With wild energy the men threw out of the car everything that had a  semblance of weight. Aeronauts well know the difference that a few  ounces make to safety when the gas has been exhausted from their  balloon. Professor Ariel had cast everything overboard with maniacal  celerity, and now, clad only in his undershirt and trousers, was hacking  at the trailing ladder to cut that off. The balloon had risen some fifty  or a hundred feet. It now halted irresolute. Could it recover itself and  mount? or would it lose courage and fall, dragging its passengers to a  certain death?    But far more fearful than the latter imminent danger was the sight of  the threatening sky. Not one of these imperilled people had ever seen  such whirling masses of mad, black, revengeful clouds. These centred  from all sides upon the site of the lost city. They rushed together and  formed eddies and funnels. They roared like live things. It was in one  of these smaller whirlwinds that the balloon was caught.    The massive folds of silk beat and writhed and tried to tear themselves  loose from the clutches of the elements. The four in the car clung to it  with terror, watching the mad-cap play of the wind.    \"It's no use--I can't!\" cried the professor with damp, white face,  throwing down his knife. \"The wire is too strong. We must get to the  rigging, cut off the car, and God help us!\"    The situation was indeed appalling. The ladder, for purposes of greater  stability, was made of wire woven over with manila. The sharp knife  could not cut that useless weight.    In this crisis the young lady recovered her equipoise. She began to take  off her shoes.    \"It will help a little,\" she said. Then she began shyly to loose her  overskirt. But the whirlwind caught the car and nearly upset it. It  swirled and almost touched the ground.    \"Up!\" cried the professor. He caught the girl and tied her in  dexterously. Every man held himself in the ropes that bound the car to  the balloon as best he might. It was a fearful chance. The professor cut  a rope and made bowline chairs. Each sat in his noose and held on for  dear life. The professor, who never lost his coolness, worked as if he  had done this before. And indeed he had.    Swift had the presence of mind or the presence of heart to support the  young lady in this perilous moment.    Cut! cut! The car had been caught in a counter eddy, and was five  hundred feet or so in the air, but rapidly descending. Then the last  strand parted. Relieved of several hundred-weight, the balloon bounded  up. It was buffeted and whirled and tossed from cloud to cloud. The  maddened elements clutched at it. Balls of fire danced upon the ground  beneath, and darted here and there from cloud to cloud. As the professor  gave the last cut and the balloon soared aloft, there was a report as if  a thousand rounds of artillery were concentrated in one shot. There was  a dazzling streak of light. It smote the adventurers blind. It smote  them deaf. It stunned them into insensibility. Like limp corpses the  four sat as they were whirled on high, each clasping his arms  instinctively about the rope that held him.    It seemed as if death had overtaken them all and petrified them with its  touch.    \"I have solved the problem.\" Mr. Ticks opened his eyes and gasped. \"By  my faith, where are we?\"    Far below were opaque blackness, storm and wind. Above, the blue,  infinite ether. The sun shone brilliantly. It warmed the balloon. It  expanded the gas. The _High Tariff_ kept rising. The stillness was a  miracle. Beneath stretched the panorama of a stricken country. The  highest peaks of the Buzzard mountains were below the balloon. The storm  raged over the lake and the lost city like a mock storm, it was so  distant and so unimportant. Now and then there was a flash of yellow  light and a distant reverberation. The storm was fearful, but it was  only a small blot upon a fair landscape when viewed from such a height.    \"Yes,\" mused Mr. Ticks aloud, pulling his energies together. \"I know now  what it all means. I know the secret of Russell's unparalleled  disaster.\"    As he spoke he reached out and shook the professor, then Swift; then he  touched the young lady with gentle deference. The three opened their  eyes, one after another.    \"We're saved! Oh, what luck! We're saved!\" cried Professor Ariel. Tears  of joy started from his eyes. \"Say, mister,\" his devil-may-care manner  returning to him in the fulness of his ecstasy. \"Say,\" punching Swift,  \"you ain't got a chaw about you, have you?\"    But Swift, lifting up his bewildered eyes, took in the glorious blue sky  and sun, then his gaze fell upon the horror from which they had  escaped. Mechanically he searched the pockets of his trousers. Out of  his pistol pocket he pulled a flask of brandy--all that survived to him  of his outfit for this ghastly journey. This he had forgotten, otherwise  it would have gone by the rail along with his pocketbook, to lighten the  car.    \"Not yet,\" he said, pushing aside the professor's longing hand, \"the  lady first!\"    The brandy, the warm sun and the prospect of safety roused the girl  considerably. Possibly Swifts supporting arm hastened her recuperation.    Swift passed the bottle to Mr. Ticks, who drank, and coughed, and drank  again.    \"It's St. Croix, vintage of forty-two,\" said Mr. Ticks, gratefully. The  professor got what he could. But Swift would not touch any. He was  experiencing a finer intoxication. His eyes met those of the girl, who  had been the unconscious cause of all their danger. She seemed to  perceive this, for she soon broke the profound silence by suggesting  with a blush:    \"You needn't hold me so tight, sir. I'll try not to fall.\"    \"Can you talk now?\" asked Mr. Ticks of their lady companion.    This question deflected a possible embarrassment, but Swift, deeming it  safe to allow no risk, did not relax his hold of the girl.    \"Are you a reporter?\" he asked, with an unaccountable desire to keep the  conversation in his own hands. \"This gentleman and myself are on the  _Daily Planet_, the other man is professor of the balloon.\"    \"How did you know?\" she answered with a first approach to a smile. \"I  am, or at least I was, society reporter on the _Russell Telegraph_.\" The  last word started Mr. Ticks up again.    \"You witnessed the destruction of Russell? Do you know that its cause is  the despair of the world? Do you know----\"    \"Oh, it was dreadful! dreadful! dreadful!\" interrupted the girl with a  shudder. \"I was out in my boat alone and saw it all!\"    The lady hid her face. \"I was so tired that morning I couldn't breathe.  It was oppressive. The air was over-charged so strangely. You touched an  iron post and a spark shot out and gave you a shock. I couldn't stay, so  I begged off and took my lunch and my work in my little skiff and rowed  two miles out and anchored and tried to write.\"    \"Can you state for the _Planet_, Miss----?\"    \"Insula Magnet, that's my name, sir.\"    \"Miss Magnet, can you state at what exact hour the catastrophe  occurred?\"    The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33687"],[0,"Illustrative Anecdotes of the Animal Kingdom (#13)"],[1," rather  troublesome, for he is in constant motion, and examining every object  within his reach. He generally sits on his hinder parts when feeding,  conveying all his food to his mouth with his fore paws. He will eat  almost every kind of food, but is particularly fond of sweetmeats, and  will indulge in spirituous liquors even to drunkenness. He feeds  chiefly at night, in a wild state, and sleeps during the day.    Brickell gives an interesting account, in his \"History of North  Carolina,\" of the cunning manifested by the raccoon in pursuit of its  prey. \"It is fond of crabs, and, when in quest of them, will take its  station by a swamp, and hang its tail over into the water, which the  crabs mistake for food, and lay hold of it; as soon as the raccoon  feels them pinch, it pulls up its tail with a sudden jerk, and they  generally quit their hold upon being removed from the water. The  raccoon instantly seizes the crabs in its mouth, removes them to a  distance from the water, and greedily devours its prey. It is very  careful how it takes them up, which it always does from behind, holding  them transversely, in order to prevent their catching its mouth with  their nippers.\"    When enraged, or desirous of attacking a person, the raccoon advances  with arched back and bristling hair, and with its chin or under jaw  close to the ground, uttering gruff sounds of displeasure. If once  injured, it seldom forgives its enemy. On one occasion, a servant  struck a tame raccoon with a whip: in vain did he afterwards attempt a  reconciliation; neither eggs, nor food most coveted by the animal,  availed in pacifying it. At his approach, it flew into a sort of fury;  it darted at him with sparkling eyes, uttering loud cries.    Its accents of anger were very singular; sometimes one might fancy them  the whistling of the curlew, at others, the hoarse bark of an old dog.  If any one beat it, it opposed no resistance; it concealed its head and  its paws, like the hedgehog, by rolling itself into a ball. In this  position it would suffer death. When its chain broke, it would allow no  one to approach it, and it was with great difficulty refettered.      THE COATI.    This animal, which frequents the woods of South America, resembles the  raccoon, but is smaller. He is in the habit of rooting under trees, and  thus overturns many of them, even those of large size. The most curious  incident in his history, is that he eats his own tail! This is  explained by Godman as follows: \"The extreme length of its tail, in  which the blood circulates but feebly, exposes it to the influence of  cold or frost; and the exceedingly tormenting irritation produced  thereby leads the animal to gnaw and scratch the tail, to relieve the  excessive itching. The disease spreads, and the anguish induces the  coati to gnaw more furiously, and eventually its life is destroyed by  the extension of the inflammation and irritability to the spine.\"      THE BADGER.    Of this animal there are two species, one European, the other American;  but they have a strong resemblance. It has short legs, and a long body;  lives in burrows by day, and goes forth at night to prey on roots,  snails, and worms. The American species seems to be more carnivorous  than his foreign relation: in this respect he has high example, for the  people of America eat more butcher's meat than those of Europe--for the  reason, however, that they are so fortunate as to be able to get it.    In Europe, the badger is hunted as a matter of sport, the chief  amusement being derived from the fierce resistance he makes to the  dogs. In South America, the creature is eaten, and badger hams are  deemed a delicacy. Catching this animal is a great source of interest  to the Indians. We are told that a \"party of eight, in one of their  expeditions, will destroy two or three hundred badgers, and a quantity  of deer on their return home, besides guanas. These hunting parties are  so delightful, even to the women, that the hopes of being allowed to  accompany the men will make them behave well all the year. On these  excursions they live well, and seem more happy than during the rainy  season; in their way home, they travel day and night rapidly, in spite  of obstructions, carrying long poles between them, on which the animals  are slung--the boys carrying the skins and lard; the dogs too are well  fed during this period, and seem to return with regret. A cloud of  vultures generally hover over them, and are seen by their clans a day  or two before they arrive, who make every preparation to receive them;  their return is greeted like that of victors. The rainy nights are  passed in recounting their exploits one to another.\"    The habits of the badger are said to be \"the most social of any  quadruped in the universe; it is not known to quarrel with any other  animal; even the fox, polecat, opossum, land crab, and snake, make it  resign its abode, although it is much stronger than any of them. It  also lives in the greatest harmony with its own species, subsisting  principally on nuts, roots, and vegetables; it is cleanly in its  habits, being observed to perform its ablutions while the dew is on the  ground.\"      THE GLUTTON.    This animal, which is called _wolverene_ in this country, and _carcajou_  by the Canadians, is about three feet long, and of a dark-brown color.  It is strong and courageous, and will even attack and destroy the fox  in its burrow. Its extraordinary voracity gives the impulse to all its  exertions. Incessantly in search of food, it kills animals larger and  stronger than itself, seizes the deer which the hunter has just shot,  plunders the baits on his traps, or the game these have taken. A proof  at once of the strength, the cunning, and the strong appetite, of the  glutton, was afforded by one, at Hudson's Bay, some years since, which  overset the greatest part of a pile of wood of great extent, which  contained a whole winter's firing; his object was to get at some  provisions that had been hidden there by the company's servants when  going to the factory to spend the Christmas holidays.    This animal had for many weeks been lurking about their tent, and had  committed many depredations on the game caught in their traps and  snares, as well as eaten many of the foxes that were killed by guns set  for the purpose; but he was too cunning to touch either gun or trap  himself. The people thought they had adopted the best method to secure  their provisions, by tying them in bundles, and laying them on the top  of wood piles. To their astonishment, when they returned, they found  the greatest part of the pile thrown down, notwithstanding some of the  trees with which it was constructed were as much as two men could  carry. The wood was very much scattered about; and it was supposed  that, in the animal's attempting to carry off the booty, some of the  small parcels of provisions had fallen down into the heart of the pile,  and sooner than lose half his prize, he was at the trouble of pulling  away the wood. The bags of flour, oatmeal, and peas, though of no use  to him, he tore all to pieces, and scattered the contents about on the  snow; but every bit of animal food, consisting of beef, pork, bacon,  venison, salted geese, and partridges, in considerable quantities, he  carried away.    When attacked by other animals, the glutton fights desperately, and  three stout dogs are scarcely its match. A man who had tamed one of  them threw it one day into the water, and set a couple of dogs upon it,  when it immediately seized one of them by the head, and held it under  water till it was drowned.      THE WEASEL.    The weasel stands as the type of a large number of animals, such as the  marten, sable, polecat, otter, skunk, &c.; all being characterized by a  long body, short legs, and considerable energy of disposition. Some of  the species are celebrated for their abominable odor.    The weasel is an active, bloodthirsty little animal, not exceeding  seven inches in length from the nose to the tail. It is much about the  same size as a rat, though more slender; but it is a mortal enemy to  this animal, pursuing them to their holes, and killing them in great  numbers. It is also often fatal to the hare, as it will either creep  upon it when at rest, or, lying unseen amidst the rubbish or furze,  will spring at its throat; where, as in the case of other animals which  it kills, it fixes its bite, and then sucks the blood till its victim  expires. It makes a hole in the ends of eggs, and sucks the  contents--differently from the rat, which breaks the shell to pieces.  It is a destructive enemy to pigeons, as it creeps into the holes of a  dove-cot in the evening, and surprises its prey while they are asleep;  and, from the peculiar construction of its body, there are few  situations it is incapable of reaching; for it can clamber up an almost  perpendicular wall. When it sees a man, it endeavors as quickly as  possible to get out of the way, and hide itself amidst the grass or  loose stones; but if trodden on, or seized, it will turn and bite, like  a serpent. An ordinary dog does not wish to attack it, for it instantly  fastens itself on his lips.    _Miscellaneous Anecdotes._--Weasels seem to unite, in many cases, for  mutual defence, or the attack of man. In January, 1818, a laborer in  the parish of Glencairn, Dumfriesshire, was suddenly attacked by six  weasels, which rushed upon him from an old dike in the field where he  was at work. The man, alarmed at such a furious onset, instantly betook  himself to flight; but he soon found he was closely pursued. Although  he had about him a large horsewhip, with which he endeavored, by  several back-handed strokes, to stop them, yet, so eager was the  pursuit of the weasels, that he was on the point of being seized by the  throat, when he luckily noticed, at some distance, the fallen branch of  a tree, which he made for, and,"]]]
