Massage hell out of him!\"    Kinnison again came to--partially to, rather--anguished in every fiber  of his being. Somebody was sticking barbed arrows into every square inch  of his skin; somebody else was pounding and mauling him all over, taking  particular pains to pummel and to wrench at all the places where he hurt  the worst. He yelled at the top of his voice; yelled and swore bitterly:  \"QUIT IT!\" being the expurgated gist of his luridly profane protests.  He did not make nearly as much noise as he supposed, but he made enough.    \"Thank God!\" Kinnison heard a lighter, softer voice. Surprised, he  stopped swearing and tried to stare. He couldn't see very well, either,  but he was pretty sure that there was a middle-aged woman there. There  was, and her eyes were not dry. \"He is going to live, after all!\"    As the days passed, he began really to sleep, naturally and deeply.    He grew hungrier and hungrier, and they would not give him enough to  eat. He was by turns sullen, angry, and morose.    In short, he was convalescent.    For Captain Ralph K. Kinnison, THE WAR was over.          CHAPTER 5    1941      Chubby, brownette Eunice Kinnison sat in a rocker, reading the Sunday  papers and listening to her radio. Her husband Ralph lay sprawled upon  the davenport, smoking a cigarette and reading the current issue of  EXTRAORDINARY STORIES against an unheard background of music. Mentally,  he was far from Tellus, flitting in his super-dreadnaught through parsec  after parsec of vacuous space.    The music broke off without warning and there blared out an announcement  which yanked Ralph Kinnison back to Earth with a violence almost  physical. He jumped up, jammed his hands into his pockets.    \"Pearl Harbor!\" he blurted. \"How in.... How could they have let them get  _that_ far?\"    \"But _Frank_!\" the woman gasped. She had not worried much about her  husband; but Frank, her son.... \"He'll have to go....\" Her voice died  away.    \"Not a chance in the world.\" Kinnison did not speak to soothe, but as  though from sure knowledge. \"Designing Engineer for Lockwood? He'll want  to, all right, but anyone who was ever even exposed to a course in  aeronautical engineering will sit this war out.\"    \"But they say it can't last very long. It can't, can it?\"    \"I'll say it can. Loose talk. Five years minimum is my guess--not that  my guess is any better than anybody else's.\"    He prowled around the room. His somber expression did not lighten.    \"I knew it,\" the woman said at length. \"You, too--even after the last  one.... You haven't said anything, so I thought, perhaps....\"    \"I know I didn't. There was always the chance that we wouldn't get drawn  into it. If you say so, though, I'll stay home.\"    \"Am I apt to? I let you go when you were really in danger....\"    \"What do you mean by _that_ crack?\" he interrupted.    \"Regulations. One year too old--Thank Heaven!\"    \"So what? They'll need technical experts, bad. They'll make exceptions.\"    \"Possibly. Desk jobs. Desk officers don't get killed in action--or even  wounded. Why, perhaps, with the children all grown up and married, we  won't even have to be separated.\"    \"Another angle--financial.\"    \"Pooh! Who cares about that? Besides, for a man out of a job....\"    \"From you, I'll let that one pass. Thanks, Eunie--you're an ace. I'll  shoot 'em a wire.\"    The telegram was sent. The Kinnisons waited. And waited. Until, about  the middle of January, beautifully-phrased and beautifully-mimeographed  letters began to arrive.    \"The War Department recognizes the value of your previous military  experience and appreciates your willingness once again to take up arms  in defense of the country ... Veteran Officer's Questionnaire ... please  fill out completely ... Form 191A ... Form 170 in duplicate ... Form  315.... Impossible to forecast the extent to which the War Department  may ultimately utilize the services which you and thousands of others  have so generously offered ... Form ... Form.... Not to be construed as  meaning that you have been permanently rejected ... Form ... Advise you  that while at the present time the War Department is unable to use  you....\"    \"Wouldn't that fry you to a crisp?\" Kinnison demanded. \"What in hell  have they got in their heads--sawdust? They think that because I'm fifty  one years old I've got one foot in the grave--I'll bet four dollars that  I'm in better shape than that cursed Major General and his whole damned  staff!\"    \"I don't doubt it, dear.\" Eunice's smile was, however, mostly of  relief. \"But here's an ad--it's been running for a week.\"    \"CHEMICAL ENGINEERS ... shell loading plant ... within seventy-five  miles of Townville ... over five years experience ... organic chemistry  ... technology ... explosives....\"    \"They want _you_,\" Eunice declared, soberly.    \"Well, I'm a Ph.D. in Organic. I've had more than five years experience  in both organic chemistry and technology. If I don't know something  about explosives I did a smart job of fooling Dean Montrose, back at  Gosh Whatta University. I'll write 'em a letter.\"    He wrote. He filled out a form. The telephone rang.    \"Kinnison speaking ... yes ... Dr. Sumner? Oh, yes, Chief Chemist....  That's it--one year over age, so I thought.... Oh, that's a minor  matter. We won't starve. If you can't pay a hundred and fifty I'll come  for a hundred, or seventy five, or fifty.... That's all right, too. I'm  well enough known in my own field so that a title of Junior Chemical  Engineer wouldn't hurt me a bit ... O.K., I'll see you about one o'clock  ... Stoner and Black, Inc., Operators, Entwhistle Ordnance Plant,  Entwhistle, Missikota.... What! Well, maybe I could, at that....  Goodbye.\"    He turned to his wife. \"You know what? They want me to come down right  away and go to work. Hot Dog! _Am_ I glad that I told that louse  Hendricks exactly where he could stick that job of mine!\"    \"He must have known that you wouldn't sign a straight-salary contract  after getting a share of the profits so long. Maybe he believed what you  always say just before or just after kicking somebody's teeth down their  throats; that you're so meek and mild--a regular Milquetoast. Do you  really think that they'll want you back, after the war?\" It was clear  that Eunice was somewhat concerned concerning Kinnison's joblessness;  but Kinnison was not.    \"Probably. That's the gossip. And I'll come back--when hell freezes  over.\" His square jaw tightened. \"I've heard of outfits stupid enough to  let their technical brains go because they could sell--for a  while--anything they produced, but I didn't know that I was working for  one. Maybe I'm not exactly a Timid Soul, but you'll have to admit that I  never kicked anybody's teeth out unless they tried to kick mine out  first.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Entwhistle Ordnance Plant covered twenty-odd square miles of more or  less level land. Ninety-nine percent of its area was \"Inside the fence.\"  Most of the buildings within that restricted area, while in reality  enormous, were dwarfed by the vast spaces separating them; for  safety-distances are not small when TNT and tetryl by the ton are  involved. Those structures were built of concrete, steel, glass,  transite, and tile.    \"Outside the Fence\" was different. This was the Administration Area. Its  buildings were tremendous wooden barracks, relatively close together,  packed with the executive, clerical, and professional personnel  appropriate to an organization employing over twenty thousand men and  women.    Well inside the fence, but a safety-distance short of the One Line--Loading  Line Number One--was a long, low building, quite inadequately named the  Chemical Laboratory. \"Inadequately\" in that the Chief Chemist, a highly  capable--if more than a little cantankerous--Explosives Engineer, had  already gathered into his Chemical Section most of Development, most  of Engineering, and all of Physics, Weights and Measures, and Weather.    One room of the Chemical Laboratory--in the corner most distant from  Administration--was separated from the rest of the building by a  sixteen-inch wall of concrete and steel extending from foundation to  roof without a door, window, or other opening. This was the laboratory  of the Chemical Engineers, the boys who played with explosives high and  low; any explosion occurring therein could not affect the Chemical  Laboratory proper or its personnel.    Entwhistle's main roads were paved; but in February of 1942, such minor  items as sidewalks existed only on the blue-prints. Entwhistle's soil  contained much clay, and at that time the mud was approximately six  inches deep. Hence, since there were neither inside doors nor sidewalks,  it was only natural that the technologists did not visit at all  frequently the polished-tile cleanliness of the Laboratory. It was also  natural enough for the far larger group to refer to the segregated ones  as exiles and outcasts; and that some witty chemist applied to that  isolated place the name \"Siberia.\"    The name stuck. More, the Engineers seized it and acclaimed it. They  were Siberians, and proud of it, and Siberians they remained; long after  Entwhistle's mud turned into dust. And within the year the Siberians  were to become well and favorably known in every ordnance plant in the  country, to many high executives who had no idea of how the name  originated.    Kinnison became a Siberian as enthusiastically as the youngest man  there. The term \"youngest\" is used in its exact sense, for not one of  them was a recent graduate. Each had had at least five years of  responsible experience, and \"Cappy\" Sumner kept on building. He hired  extravagantly and fired ruthlessly--to the minds of some, senselessly.  But he knew what he was doing. He knew explosives, and he knew men.

By dint of persuasion, however, we induced them to sell us  provisions, though at a monstrous rate, such as no merchant could have  afforded; and having spent the night quietly, we proceeded on to the  upper courses of the M'yombo river, which trends its way northwards  to the Mukondokua river. The scenery was most interesting, with every  variety of hill, roll, plateau, and ravine, wild and prettily wooded;  but we saw nothing of the people. Like frightened rats, as soon as they  caught the sound of our advancing march, they buried themselves in  the jungles, carrying off their grain with them. Foraging parties, of  necessity, were sent out as soon as the camp was pitched, with cloth for  purchases, and strict orders not to use force; the upshot of which was,  that my people got nothing but a few arrows fired at them by the  lurking villagers, and I was abused for my squeamishness. Moreover,  the villagers, emboldened by my lenity, vauntingly declared they would  attack the camp by night, as they could only recognise in us such men  as plunder their houses and steal their children. This caused a certain  amount of alarm among my men, which induced them to run up a stiff  bush-fence round the camp, and kept them talking all night.    This morning we marched on as usual, with one of the Hottentots lashed  on a donkey; for the wretched creature, after lying in the sun asleep,  became so sickly that he could not move or do anything for himself, and  nobody would do anything for him. The march was a long one, but under  ordinary circumstances would have been very interesting, for we passed  an immense lagoon, where hippopotami were snorting as if they invited an  attack. In the larger tree-jungles the traces of elephants, buffaloes,  rhinoceros, and antelopes were very numerous; while a rich variety of  small birds, as often happened, made me wish I had come on a shooting  rather than on a long exploring expedition. Towards sunset we arrived  at New Mbimi, a very pretty and fertile place, lying at the foot of  a cluster of steep hills, and pitched camp for three days to lay in  supplies for ten, as this was reported to be the only place where we  could buy corn until we reached Ugogo, a span of 140 miles. Mr Mbumi,  the chief of the place, a very affable negro, at once took us by the  hand, and said he would do anything we desired, for he had often been to  Zanzibar. He knew that the English were the ruling power in that land,  and that they were opposed to slavery, the terrible effects of which had  led to his abandoning Old Mbumi, on the banks of the Mukondokua river,  and rising here.    The sick Hottentot died here, and we buried him with Christian honours.  As his comrades said, he died because he had determined to die,--an  instance of that obstinate fatalism in their mulish temperament which no  kind words or threats can cure. This terrible catastrophe made me wish  to send all the remaining Hottentots back to Zanzibar; but as they all  preferred serving with me to returning to duty at the Cape, I selected  two of the MOST sickly, put them under Tabib, one of Rigby's old  servants, and told him to remain with them at Mbumi until such time  as he might find some party proceeding to the coasts; and, in the  meanwhile, for board and lodgings I have Mbumi beads and cloth. The  prices of provisions here being a good specimen of what one has to  pay at this season of the year, I give a short list of them:--sixteen  rations corn, two yards cloth; three fowls, two yards cloth; one goat,  twenty yards cloth; one cow, forty yards cloth,--the cloth being common  American sheeting. Before we left Mbumi, a party of forty men and women  of the Waquiva tribe, pressed by famine, were driven there to purchase  food. The same tribe had, however killed many of Mbumi's subjects not  long since, and therefore, in African revenge, the chief seized them  all, saying he would send them off for sale to Zanzibar market unless  they could give a legitimate reason for the cruelty they had committed.  These Waquiva, I was given to understand, occupied the steep hills  surrounding this place. They were a squalid-looking set, like the  generality of the inhabitants of this mountainous region.    This march led us over a high hill to the Mdunhwi river, another  tributary to the Mukondokua. It is all clad in the upper regions with  the slender pole-trees which characterise these hills, intermingled with  bamboo; but the bottoms are characterised by a fine growth of fig-trees  of great variety along with high grasses; whilst near the villages were  found good gardens of plantains, and numerous Palmyra trees. The rainy  season being not far off, the villagers were busy in burning rubble and  breaking their ground. Within their reach everywhere is the sarsaparilla  vine, but growing as a weed, for they know nothing of its value.    Rising up from the deep valley of Mdunhwi we had to cross another  high ridge before descending to the also deep valley of Chongue, as  picturesque a country as the middle heights of the Himalayas, dotted on  the ridges and spur-slopes by numerous small conical-hut villages;  but all so poor that we could not, had we wanted it, have purchased  provisions for a day's consumption.    Leaving this valley, we rose to the table of Manyovi, overhung with much  higher hills, looking, according to the accounts of our Hottentots, as  they eyed the fine herds of cattle grazing on the slopes, so like the  range in Kafraria, that they formed their expectations accordingly,  and appeared, for the first time since leaving the coast, happy at the  prospect before them, little dreaming that such rich places were seldom  to be met with. The Wanyamuezi porters even thought they had found a  paradise, and forthwith threw down their loads as the villagers came to  offer them grain for sale; so that, had I not had the Wanguana a little  under control, we should not have completed our distance that day, and  so reached Manyonge, which reminded me, by its ugliness, of the sterile  Somali land. Proceeding through the semi-desert rolling table-land--in  one place occupied by men who build their villages in large open squares  of flat-topped mud huts, which, when I have occasion to refer to them  in future, I shall call by their native name tembe--we could see on the  right hand the massive mountains overhanging the Mukondokua river, to  the front the western chain of these hills, and to the left the high  crab-claw shaped ridge, which, extending from the western chain, circles  round conspicuously above the swelling knolls which lie between the two  main rocky ridges. Contorted green thorn-trees, \"elephant-foot\" stumps,  and aloes, seem to thrive best here, by their very nature indicating  what the country is, a poor stony land. Our camp was pitched by the  river Rumuma, where, sheltered from the winds, and enriched by alluvial  soil, there ought to have been no scarcity; but still the villagers had  nothing to sell.    On we went again to Marenga Mkhaili, the \"Salt Water,\" to breakfast, and  camped in the crooked green thorns by night, carrying water on for our  supper. This kind of travelling--forced marches--hard as it may appear,  was what we liked best, for we felt that we were shortening the journey,  and in doing so, shortening the risks of failure by disease, by war, by  famine, and by mutiny. We had here no grasping chiefs to detain us  for presents, nor had our men time to become irritable and truculent,  concoct devices for stopping the way, or fight amongst themselves.    On again, and at last we arrived at the foot of the western chain;  but not all together. Some porters, overcome by heat and thirst, lay  scattered along the road, while the corporal of the Hottentots allowed  his mule to stray from him, never dreaming the animal would travel far  from his comrades, and, in following after him, was led such a long way  into the bush, that my men became alarmed for his safety, knowing as  they did that the \"savages\" were out living like monkeys on the calabash  fruit, and looking out for any windfalls, such as stragglers worth  plundering, that might come in their way. At first the Wanguana  attempted to track down the corporal; but finding he would not answer  their repeated shots, and fearful for their own safety, they came into  camp and reported the case. Losing no time, I ordered twenty men, armed  with carbines, to carry water for the distressed porters, and bring the  corporal back as soon as possible. They all marched off, as they always  do on such exploits, in high good-humour with themselves for the valour  which they intended to show; and in the evening came in, firing their  guns in the most reckless manner, beaming with delight; for they had  the corporal in tow, two men and two women captives, and a spear as a  trophy. Then in high impatience, all in a breath, they began a recital  of the great day's work. The corporal had followed on the spoor of the  mule, occasionally finding some of his things that had been torn from  the beast's back by the thorns, and, picking up these one by one, had  become so burdened with the weight of them, that he could follow no  farther. In this fix the twenty men came up with him, but not until they  had had a scrimmage with the \"savages,\" had secured four, and taken the  spear which had been thrown at them. Of the mule's position no one  could give an opinion, save that they imagined, in consequence of the  thickness of the bush, he would soon become irretrievably entangled in  the thicket, where the savages would find him, and bring him in as a  ransom for the prisoners.    What with the diminution of our supplies, the famished state of the  country, and the difficulties which frowned upon us in advance, together  with unwillingness to give up so good a mule, with all"]]]
