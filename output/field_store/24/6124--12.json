He also maintained that pain and_  _disease are not illusions but realities; and that it is not_ [10]  _Christian to believe they are illusions. Is this so?_    It is unchristian to believe that pain and sickness are  anything _but_ illusions. My proof of this is, that the  penalty for believing in their reality is the very pain and  disease. Jesus cast out a devil, and the dumb spake; [15]  hence it is right to know that the works of Satan are the  illusion and error which Truth casts out.    Does the gentleman above mentioned know the  meaning of divine metaphysics, or of metaphysical  theology? [20]    According to Webster, metaphysics is defined thus:  \"The science of the conceptions and relations which are  necessary to thought and knowledge; science of the  mind.\" Worcester defines it as \"the philosophy of mind,  as distinguished from that of matter; a science of which [25]  the object is to explain the principles and causes of  all things existing,\" Brande calls metaphysics \"the  science which regards the ultimate grounds of being, as  distinguished from its phenomenal modifications.\" \"A  speculative science, which soars beyond the bounds of [30]  experience,\" is a further definition.    [Page 69.]    Divine metaphysics is that which treats of the exist- [1]  ence of God, His essence, relations, and attributes. A  sneer at metaphysics is a scoff at Deity; at His goodness,  mercy, and might.    Christian Science is the unfolding of true metaphysics; [5]  that is, of Mind, or God, and His attributes. Science rests  on Principle and demonstration. The Principle of Chris-  tian Science is divine. Its rule is, that man shall utilize  the divine power.    In Genesis i. 26, we read: \"Let us make man in [10]  our image, after our likeness: and let them have  dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of  the air.\"    I was once called to visit a sick man to whom the  regular physicians had given three doses of Croton [15]  oil, and then had left him to die. Upon my arrival I  found him barely alive, and in terrible agony. In one  hour he was well, and the next day he attended to his  business. I removed the stoppage, healed him of en-  teritis, and neutralized the bad effects of the poison- [20]  ous oil. His physicians had failed even to move his  bowels,--though the wonder was, with the means  used in their effort to accomplish this result, that  they had not quite killed him. According to their  diagnosis, the exciting cause of the inflammation and [25]  stoppage was--eating smoked herring. The man is  living yet; and I will send his address to any one  who may wish to apply to him for information about  his case.    Now comes the question: Had that sick man dominion [30]  over the fish in his stomach?    His want of control over \"the fish of the sea\" must    [Page 70.]    have been an illusion, or else the Scriptures misstate [1]  man's power. That the Bible is true I believe, not  only, but I _demonstrated_ its truth when I exercised  my power over the fish, cast out the sick man's illu-  sion, and healed him. Thus it was shown that the [5]  healing action of Mind upon the body has its only ex-  planation in divine metaphysics. As a man \"thinketh  in his heart, so is he.\" When the mortal thought, or be-  lief, was removed, the man was well.    _What did Jesus mean when he said to the dying thief,_ [10]  _\"__To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise__\"__?_    Paradisaical rest from physical agony would come to  the criminal, if the dream of dying should startle him  from the dream of suffering. The paradise of Spirit  would come to Jesus, in a spiritual sense of Life and [15]  power. Christ Jesus lived and reappeared. He was too  good to die; for goodness is immortal. The thief was  not equal to the demands of the hour; but sin was de-  stroying itself, and had already begun to die,--as  the poor thief's prayer for help indicated. The dy- [20]  ing malefactor and our Lord were inevitably sepa-  rated through Mind. The thief's body, as matter,  must dissolve into its native nothingness; whereas the  body of the holy Spirit of Jesus was eternal. That  day the thief would be with Jesus only in a finite [25]  and material sense of relief; while our Lord would  soon be rising to the supremacy of Spirit, working  out, even in the silent tomb, those wonderful demon-  strations of divine power, in which none could equal his  glory. [30]    [Page 71.]    _Is it right for me to treat others, when I am not entirely_ [1]  _well myself?_    The late John B. Gough is said to have suffered from  an appetite for alcoholic drink until his death; yet he  saved many a drunkard from this fatal appetite. Paul [5]  had a thorn in the flesh: one writer thinks that he was  troubled with rheumatism, and another that he had sore  eyes; but this is certain, that he healed others who were  sick. It is unquestionably right to do right; and heal-  ing the sick is a very right thing to do. [10]    _Does Christian Science set aside the law of transmission,_  _prenatal desires, and good or bad influences on the unborn_  _child?_    Science never averts law, but supports it. All actual  causation must interpret omnipotence, the all-knowing [15]  Mind. Law brings out Truth, not error; unfolds divine  Principle,--but neither human hypothesis nor matter.  Errors are based on a mortal or material formation; they  are suppositional modes, not the factors of divine presence  and power. [20]    Whatever is humanly conceived is a departure from  divine law; hence its mythical origin and certain end.  According to the Scriptures,--St. Paul declares astutely,  \"For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all  things,\"--man is incapable of originating; nothing can [25]  be formed apart from God, good, the all-knowing Mind.  What seems to be of human origin is the counterfeit  of the divine,--even human concepts, mortal shadows  flitting across the dial of time.    Whatever is real is right and eternal; hence the im- [30]  mutable and just law of Science, that God is good only,    [Page 72.]    and can transmit to man and the universe nothing evil, [1]  or unlike Himself. For the innocent babe to be born a  lifelong sufferer because of his parents' mistakes or sins,  were sore injustice. Science sets aside man as a creator,  and unfolds the eternal harmonies of the only living and [5]  true origin, God.    According to the beliefs of the flesh, both good and  bad traits of the parents are transmitted to their help-  less offspring, and God is supposed to impart to man  this fatal power. It is cause for rejoicing that this belief [10]  is as false as it is remorseless. The immutable Word  saith, through the prophet Ezekiel, \"What mean ye, that  ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying,  The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's  teeth are set on edge? As I live, saith the Lord God, [15]  ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb  in Israel.\"    _Are material things real when they are harmonious, and_  _do they disappear only to the natural sense? Does this_  _Scripture, __\"__Your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have_ [20]  _need of all these things__\"__ imply that Spirit takes note of_  _matter?_    The Science of Mind, as well as the material unii  verse, shows that nothing which is material is in  perpetual harmony. Matter is manifest mortal mind, [35]  and it exists only to material sense. Real sensation  is not material; it is, and must be, mental: and Mind  is not mortal, it is immortal. Being is God, infinite  Spirit; therefore it cannot cognize aught material, or  outside of infinity. [30]    The Scriptural passage quoted affords no evidence of    [Page 73.]    the reality of matter, or that God is conscious of it. [1]  The so-called material body is said to suffer, but this  supposition is proven erroneous when Mind casts out  the suffering. The Scripture saith, \"Whom the Lord  loveth He chasteneth;\" and again, \"He doth not [5]  afflict willingly.\" Interpreted materially, these pas-  sages conflict; they mingle the testimony of immor-  tal Science with mortal sense; but once discern their  spiritual meaning, and it separates the false sense from  the true, and establishes the reality of what is spiritual, [10]  and the unreality of materiality.    Law is never material: it is always mental and moral,  and a commandment to the wise. The foolish disobey  moral law, and are punished. Human wisdom therefore  can get no farther than to say, He knoweth that we have [15]  need of experience. Belief fulfils the conditions of a be-  lief, and these conditions destroy the belief. Hence the  verdict of experience: We have need of _these_ things; we  have need to know that the so-called pleasures and pains  of matter--yea, that all subjective states of false sensa- [20]  tion--are _unreal_.    _\"__And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you,_  _That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when_  _the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory,_  _ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the_ [25]  _twelve tribes of Israel.__\"_ (Matt. xix. 28.) _What is meant_  _by regeneration?_    It is the appearing of divine law to human under-  standing; the spiritualization that comes from spiritual  sense in contradistinction to the testimony of the so- [30]  called material senses. The phenomena of Spirit in    [Page 74.]    Christian Science, and the divine correspondence of [1]  noumenon and phenomenon understood, are here signi-  fied. This new-born sense subdues not only the false  sense of generation, but the human will, and the un-  natural enmity of mortal man toward God. It quickly [5]  imparts a new apprehension of the true basis of being,  and the spiritual foundation for the affections which en-  throne the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31511"],[0,"A History of Witchcraft in England from 1558 to 1718 (#13)"],[1,"in  preparation. If this theory be true--and Mr. Brinsley Nicholson, his  modern commentator, has adduced excellent reasons for accepting  it[2]--there can be but one explanation, the St. Oses affair. That  tragedy, occurring within a short distance of his own home, had no doubt  so outraged his sense of justice, that the work which he had perhaps  long been contemplating he now set himself to complete as soon as  possible.[3] Even he who runs may read in Scot's strong sentences that  he was not writing for instruction only, to propound a new doctrine, but  that he was battling with the single purpose to stop a detestable and  wicked practice. Something of a dilettante in real life, he became in  his writing a man with an absorbing mission. That mission sprang not  indeed from indignation at the St. Oses affair alone. From the days of  childhood his experience had been of a kind to encourage skepticism. He  had been reared in a county where Elizabeth Barton, the Holy Maid of  Kent, first came into prominence, and he had seen the downfall that  followed her public exposure.[4] In the year after he brought out his  _Hoppe-garden_, his county was again stirred by performances of a  supposedly supernatural character. Mildred Norrington, a girl of  seventeen,[5] used ventriloquism with such skill that she convinced two  clergymen and all her neighbors that she was possessed. In answer to  queries, the evil spirit that spoke through Mildred declared that \"old  Alice of Westwell\"[6] had sent him to possess the girl. Alice, the  spirit admitted, stood guilty of terrible witchcrafts. The demon's word  was taken, and Alice seems to have been \"arraigned upon this  evidence.\"[7] But, through the justices' adroit management of the trial,  the fraud of the accuser was exposed. She confessed herself a pretender  and suffered \"condign punishment.\" This case happened within six miles  of Scot's home and opened his eyes to the possibility of humbug. In the  very same year two pretenders, Agnes Bridges and Rachel Pinder, were  convicted in London. By vomiting pins and straws[8] they had convinced  many that they were bewitched, but the trickery was soon found out and  they were compelled to do public penance at St. Paul's.[9] We are not  told what was the fate of a detestable Mother Baker, who, when consulted  by the parents of a sick girl at New Romney in Kent, accused a neighbor  woman.[10] She said that the woman had made a waxen heart and pricked it  and by this means accomplished her evil purpose. In order to prove her  accusation, she had in the mean time concealed the wax figure of a heart  in the house of the woman she accused, and then pretended to find  it.[11] It is some satisfaction to know that the malicious  creature--who, during the history of witchcraft, had many imitators--was  caught and compelled to confess.    Scot learned, indeed, by observing marvels of this sort[12]--what it is  strange that many others did not learn--to look upon displays of the  supernatural with a good deal of doubt. How much he had ever believed in  them we do not know. It is not unlikely that in common with his  generation he had, as a young man, held a somewhat ill-defined opinion  about the Devil's use of witches. The belief in that had come down, a  comparatively innocuous tradition, from a primitive period. It was a  subject that had not been raised in speculation or for that matter in  court rooms. But since Scot's early manhood all this had been changed.  England had been swept by a tidal wave of suspicion. Hazy theological  notions had been tightened into rigid convictions. Convictions had  passed into legislative statutes and instructions to judges. The bench,  which had at first acted on the new laws with caution and a desire to  detect imposture, became infected with the fear and grew more ready to  discover witchcraft and to punish it. It is unnecessary to recapitulate  the progress of a movement already traced in the previous chapter.  Suffice it to say that the Kentish gentleman, familiarized with accounts  of imposture, was unwilling to follow the rising current of  superstition. Of course this is merely another way of saying that Scot  was unconventional in his mental operations and thought the subject out  for himself with results variant from those of his own generation. Here  was a new abuse in England, here was a wrong that he had seen spring up  within his own lifetime and in his own part of England. He made it his  mission as far as possible to right the wrong. \"For so much,\" he says,  \"as the mightie helpe themselves together, and the poore widowes crie,  though it reach to heaven, is scarse heard here upon earth: I thought  good (according to my poore abilitie) to make intercession, that some  part of common rigor, and some points of hastie judgement may be advised  upon.\"[13]    It was indeed a splendid mission and he was singularly well equipped for  it. He had the qualifications--scholarly training and the power of  scientific observation, a background of broad theological and scriptural  information, a familiarity with legal learning and practice, as well as  a command of vigorous and incisive language--which were certain to make  his work effective towards its object.    That he was a scholar is true in more senses than one. In his use of  deduction from classical writers he was something of a scholastic, in  his willingness to venture into new fields of thought he was a product  of the Renaissance, in his thorough use of research he reminds us of a  modern investigator. He gives in his book a bibliography of the works  consulted by him and one counts over two hundred Latin and thirty  English titles. His reading had covered the whole field of superstition.  To Cornelius Agrippa and to Wierus (Johann Weyer),[14] who had attacked  the tyranny of superstition upon the Continent, he owed an especial  debt. He had not, however, borrowed enough from them to impair in any  serious way the value of his own original contribution.    In respect to law, Scot was less a student than a man of experience. The  _Discoverie_, however, bristled with references which indicated a legal  way of thinking. He was almost certainly a man who had used the law.  Brinsley Nicholson believes that he had been a justice of the peace. In  any case he had a lawyer's sense of the value of evidence and a lawyer's  way of putting his case.    No less practical was his knowledge of theology and scripture. Here he  had to meet the baffling problems of the Witch of Endor. The story of  the witch who had called up before the frightened King Saul the spirit  of the dead Samuel and made him speak, stood as a lion in the path of  all opponents of witch persecution. When Scot dared to explain this Old  Testament tale as an instance of ventriloquism, and to compare it to the  celebrated case of Mildred Norrington, he showed a boldness in  interpretation of the Bible far in advance of his contemporaries.    His anticipation of present-day points of view cropped out perhaps more  in his scientific spirit than in any other way. For years before he put  pen to paper he had been conducting investigations into alleged cases of  conjuring and witchcraft, attending trials,[15] and questioning  clergymen and magistrates. For such observation he was most favorably  situated and he used his position in his community to further his  knowledge. A man almost impertinently curious was this sixteenth-century  student. When he learned of a conjurer whose sentence of death had been  remitted by the queen and who professed penitence for his crimes, he  opened a correspondence and obtained from the man the clear statement  that his conjuries were all impostures. The prisoner referred him to \"a  booke written in the old Saxon toong by one Sir John Malborne, a divine  of Oxenford, three hundred yeares past,\" in which all these trickeries  are cleared up. Scot put forth his best efforts to procure the work from  the parson to whom it had been entrusted, but without success.[16] In  another case he attended the assizes at Rochester, where a woman was on  trial. One of her accusers was the vicar of the parish, who made several  charges, not the least of which was that he could not enunciate clearly  in church owing to enchantment. This explanation Scot carried to her and  she was able to give him an explanation much less creditable to the  clergyman of the ailment, an explanation which Scot found confirmed by  an enquiry among the neighbors. To quiet such rumors in the community  about the nature of the illness the vicar had to procure from London a  medical certificate that it was a lung trouble.[17]    Can we wonder that a student at such pains to discover the fact as to a  wrong done should have used barbed words in the portrayal of injustice?  Strong convictions spurred on his pen, already taught to shape vigorous  and incisive sentences. Not a stylist, as measured by the highest  Elizabethan standards of charm and mellifluence, he possessed a  clearness and directness which win the modern reader. By his methods of  analysis he displayed a quality of mind akin to and probably influenced  by that of Calvin, while his intellectual attitude showed the stimulus  of the Reformation.    He was indeed in his own restricted field a reformer. He was not only  the protagonist of a new cause, but a pioneer who had to cut through the  underbrush of opinion a pathway for speculation to follow. So far as  England was concerned, Scot found no philosophy of the subject, no  systematic defences or assaults upon the loosely constructed theory of  demonic agency. It was for him to state in definite terms the beliefs he  was seeking to overthrow. The Roman church knew fairly well by this time  what it meant by witchcraft, but English theologians and philosophers  would hardly have found common ground on any one tenet about the  matter.[18] Without exaggeration it may be asserted"]]]
