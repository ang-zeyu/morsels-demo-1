For example, the Indians of  Peru employed certain stones for the increase of maize, others for  the increase of potatoes, and others again for the increase of  cattle. The stones used to make maize grow were fashioned in the  likeness of cobs of maize, and the stones destined to multiply  cattle had the shape of sheep.    In some parts of Melanesia a like belief prevails that certain  sacred stones are endowed with miraculous powers which correspond in  their nature to the shape of the stone. Thus a piece of water-worn  coral on the beach often bears a surprising likeness to a  bread-fruit. Hence in the Banks Islands a man who finds such a coral  will lay it at the root of one of his bread-fruit trees in the  expectation that it will make the tree bear well. If the result  answers his expectation, he will then, for a proper remuneration,  take stones of less-marked character from other men and let them lie  near his, in order to imbue them with the magic virtue which resides  in it. Similarly, a stone with little discs upon it is good to bring  in money; and if a man found a large stone with a number of small  ones under it, like a sow among her litter, he was sure that to  offer money upon it would bring him pigs. In these and similar cases  the Melanesians ascribe the marvellous power, not to the stone  itself, but to its indwelling spirit; and sometimes, as we have just  seen, a man endeavours to propitiate the spirit by laying down  offerings on the stone. But the conception of spirits that must be  propitiated lies outside the sphere of magic, and within that of  religion. Where such a conception is found, as here, in conjunction  with purely magical ideas and practices, the latter may generally be  assumed to be the original stock on which the religious conception  has been at some later time engrafted. For there are strong grounds  for thinking that, in the evolution of thought, magic has preceded  religion. But to this point we shall return presently.    The ancients set great store on the magical qualities of precious  stones; indeed it has been maintained, with great show of reason,  that such stones were used as amulets long before they were worn as  mere ornaments. Thus the Greeks gave the name of tree-agate to a  stone which exhibits tree-like markings, and they thought that if  two of these gems were tied to the horns or necks of oxen at the  plough, the crop would be sure to be plentiful. Again, they  recognised a milkstone which produced an abundant supply of milk in  women if only they drank it dissolved in honey-mead. Milk-stones are  used for the same purpose by Greek women in Crete and Melos at the  present day; in Albania nursing mothers wear the stones in order to  ensure an abundant flow of milk. Again, the Greeks believed in a  stone which cured snake-bites, and hence was named the snake-stone;  to test its efficacy you had only to grind the stone to powder and  sprinkle the powder on the wound. The wine-coloured amethyst  received its name, which means \"not drunken,\" because it was  supposed to keep the wearer of it sober; and two brothers who  desired to live at unity were advised to carry magnets about with  them, which, by drawing the twain together, would clearly prevent  them from falling out.    The ancient books of the Hindoos lay down a rule that after sunset  on his marriage night a man should sit silent with his wife till the  stars begin to twinkle in the sky. When the pole-star appears, he  should point it out to her, and, addressing the star, say, \"Firm art  thou; I see thee, the firm one. Firm be thou with me, O thriving  one!\" Then, turning to his wife, he should say, \"To me Brihaspati  has given thee; obtaining offspring through me, thy husband, live  with me a hundred autumns.\" The intention of the ceremony is plainly  to guard against the fickleness of fortune and the instability of  earthly bliss by the steadfast influence of the constant star. It is  the wish expressed in Keats's last sonnet:          Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art--      Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night.      Dwellers by the sea cannot fail to be impressed by the sight of its  ceaseless ebb and flow, and are apt, on the principles of that rude  philosophy of sympathy and resemblance which here engages our  attention, to trace a subtle relation, a secret harmony, between its  tides and the life of man, of animals, and of plants. In the flowing  tide they see not merely a symbol, but a cause of exuberance, of  prosperity, and of life, while in the ebbing tide they discern a  real agent as well as a melancholy emblem of failure, of weakness,  and of death. The Breton peasant fancies that clover sown when the  tide is coming in will grow well, but that if the plant be sown at  low water or when the tide is going out, it will never reach  maturity, and that the cows which feed on it will burst. His wife  believes that the best butter is made when the tide has just turned  and is beginning to flow, that milk which foams in the churn will go  on foaming till the hour of high water is past, and that water drawn  from the well or milk extracted from the cow while the tide is  rising will boil up in the pot or saucepan and overflow into the  fire. According to some of the ancients, the skins of seals, even  after they had been parted from their bodies, remained in secret  sympathy with the sea, and were observed to ruffle when the tide was  on the ebb. Another ancient belief, attributed to Aristotle, was  that no creature can die except at ebb tide. The belief, if we can  trust Pliny, was confirmed by experience, so far as regards human  beings, on the coast of France. Philostratus also assures us that at  Cadiz dying people never yielded up the ghost while the water was  high. A like fancy still lingers in some parts of Europe. On the  Cantabrian coast they think that persons who die of chronic or acute  disease expire at the moment when the tide begins to recede. In  Portugal, all along the coast of Wales, and on some parts of the  coast of Brittany, a belief is said to prevail that people are born  when the tide comes in, and die when it goes out. Dickens attests  the existence of the same superstition in England. \"People can't  die, along the coast,\" said Mr. Pegotty, \"except when the tide's  pretty nigh out. They can't be born, unless it's pretty nigh in--not  properly born till flood.\" The belief that most deaths happen at ebb  tide is said to be held along the east coast of England from  Northumberland to Kent. Shakespeare must have been familiar with it,  for he makes Falstaff die \"even just between twelve and one, e'en at  the turning o' the tide.\" We meet the belief again on the Pacific  coast of North America among the Haidas. Whenever a good Haida is  about to die he sees a canoe manned by some of his dead friends, who  come with the tide to bid him welcome to the spirit land. \"Come with  us now,\" they say, \"for the tide is about to ebb and we must  depart.\" At Port Stephens, in New South Wales, the natives always  buried their dead at flood tide, never at ebb, lest the retiring  water should bear the soul of the departed to some distant country.    To ensure a long life the Chinese have recourse to certain  complicated charms, which concentrate in themselves the magical  essence emanating, on homoeopathic principles, from times and  seasons, from persons and from things. The vehicles employed to  transmit these happy influences are no other than grave-clothes.  These are provided by many Chinese in their lifetime, and most  people have them cut out and sewn by an unmarried girl or a very  young woman, wisely calculating that, since such a person is likely  to live a great many years to come, a part of her capacity to live  long must surely pass into the clothes, and thus stave off for many  years the time when they shall be put to their proper use. Further,  the garments are made by preference in a year which has an  intercalary month; for to the Chinese mind it seems plain that  grave-clothes made in a year which is unusually long will possess  the capacity of prolonging life in an unusually high degree. Amongst  the clothes there is one robe in particular on which special pains  have been lavished to imbue it with this priceless quality. It is a  long silken gown of the deepest blue colour, with the word  \"longevity\" embroidered all over it in thread of gold. To present an  aged parent with one of these costly and splendid mantles, known as  \"longevity garments,\" is esteemed by the Chinese an act of filial  piety and a delicate mark of attention. As the garment purports to  prolong the life of its owner, he often wears it, especially on  festive occasions, in order to allow the influence of longevity,  created by the many golden letters with which it is bespangled, to  work their full effect upon his person. On his birthday, above all,  he hardly ever fails to don it, for in China common sense bids a man  lay in a large stock of vital energy on his birthday, to be expended  in the form of health and vigour during the rest of the year.  Attired in the gorgeous pall, and absorbing its blessed influence at  every pore, the happy owner receives complacently the  congratulations of friends and relations, who warmly express their  admiration of these magnificent cerements, and of the filial piety  which prompted the children to bestow so beautiful and useful a  present on the author of their being.

There are three of these documents; one is at Christchurch, another at  St. Augustine's, and Brihtric himself has the third.\"         Nuns and monks lived in segregated nunneries and monasteries on church  land and grew their own food. The local bishop usually was also an abbot  of a monastery. The priests and nuns wore long robes with loose belts  and did not carry weapons. Their life was ordered by the ringing of the  bell to start certain activities, such as prayer; meals; meetings; work  in the fields, gardens, or workshops; and copying and illuminating  books. They chanted to pay homage and to communicate with God or his  saints. They taught justice, piety, chastity, peace, and charity; and  cared for the sick. Caring for the sick entailed mostly praying to God  as it was thought that only God could cure. They bathed a few times a  year. They got their drinking water from upstream of where they had  located their latrines over running water. The large monasteries had  libraries, dormitories, guesthouses, kitchens, butteries to store wine,  bakehouses, breweries, dairies, granaries, barns, fishponds, orchards,  vineyards, gardens, workshops, laundries, lavatories with long stone or  marble washing troughs, and towels. Slavery was diminished by the church  by excommunication for the sale of a child over seven. The clergy taught  that manumission of slaves was good for the soul of the dead, so it  became frequent in wills. The clergy were to abstain from red meat and  wine and were to be celibate. But there were periods of laxity.  Punishment was by the cane or scourge.         The Archbishop of Canterbury began anointing new kings at the time of  coronation to emphasize that the king was ruler by the grace of God. As  God's minister, the king could only do right. From 973, the new king  swore to protect the Christian church, to prevent inequities to all  subjects, and to render good justice, which became a standard oath.         It was believed that there was a celestial hierarchy, with heavenly  hosts in specific places. The heavenly bodies revolved in circles around  the earthly world on crystal spheres of their own, which were serene,  harmonious, and eternal. This contrasted with the change, death, and  decay that occurred in the earthly world. Also in this world,  Aristotle's four elements of earth, air, fire, and water sought their  natural places, e.g. bubbles of air rising through water. The planets  were called wanderers because their motion did not fit the circular  scheme.         God intervened in daily life, especially if worshipped. Saints such as  Bede and Hilda performed miracles, especially ones of curing. Their  spirits could be contacted through their relics, which rested at the  altars of churches. When someone was said to have the devil in him,  people took it quite literally. A real Jack Frost nipped noses and  fingers and made the ground too hard to work. Little people, elves,  trolls, and fairies inhabited the fears and imaginings of people. The  forest was the mysterious home of spirits. People prayed to God to help  them in their troubles and from the work of the devil. Since natural  causes of events were unknown, people attributed events to wills like  their own. Illness was thought to be caused by demons. People hung  charms around their neck for cure and treatments of magic and herbs were  given. Some had hallucinogenic effects, which were probably useful for  pain. For instance, the remedy for \"mental vacancy and folly\" was a  drink of \"fennel, agrimony, cockle, and marche\". Blood- letting by  leeches and cautery were used for most maladies, which were thought to  be caused by imbalance of the four bodily humors: sanguine, phlegmatic,  choleric, and melancholic. These four humors reflected the four basic  elements air, water, fire, and earth. Blood was hot and moist like air;  phlegm was cold and moist like water; choler or yellow bile was hot and  dry like fire; and melancholy or black bile was cold and dry like earth.  Bede had explained that when blood predominates, it makes people joyful,  glad, sociable, laughing, and talking a great deal. Phlegm renders them  slow, sleepy, and forgetful. Red cholic makes them thin, though eating  much, swift, bold, wrathful, and agile. Black cholic makes them serious  of settled disposition, even sad. To relieve brain pressure and/or maybe  to exorcise evil spirits, holes were made in skulls by a drill with a  metal tip that was caused to turn back and forth by a strap wrapped  around a wooden handle. A king's daughter Edith inspired a cult of holy  wells, whose waters were thought to alleviate eye conditions. Warmth and  rest were also used for illness. Agrimony boiled in milk was thought to  relieve impotence in men.         It was known that the liver casted out impurities in the blood. The  stages of fetal growth were known. The soul was not thought to enter a  fetus until after the third month, so presumably abortions within three  months were allowable.         The days of the week were Sun day, Moon day, Tiw's day (Viking god of  war), Woden's day (Viking god of victory, master magician, calmer of  storms, and raiser of the dead), Thor's day (Viking god of thunder),  Frig's day (Viking goddess of fertility and growing things), and  Saturn's day (Roman god). Special days of the year were celebrated:  Christmas, the birthday of Jesus Christ; the twelve days of Yuletide (a  Viking tradition) when candles were lit and houses decorated with  evergreen and there were festivities around the burning of the biggest  log available; Plough Monday for resumption of work after Yuletide;  February 14th with a feast celebrating Saint Valentinus, a Roman bishop  martyr who had married young lovers in secret when marriage was  forbidden to encourage men to fight in war; New Year's Day on March 25th  when seed was sown and people banged on drums and blew horns to banish  spirits who destroy crops with disease; Easter, the day of the  resurrection of Jesus Christ; Whitsunday, celebrating the descent of the  Holy Spirit on the apostles of Jesus and named for the white worn by  baptismal candidates; May Day when flowers and greenery was gathered  from the woods to decorate houses and churches, Morris dancers leapt  through their villages with bells, hobby horses, and waving scarves, and  people danced around a May pole holding colorful ribbons tied at the top  so they became entwined around the pole; Lammas on August 1st, when the  first bread baked from the wheat harvest was consecrated; Harvest Home  when the last harvest load was brought home while an effigy of a goddess  was carried with reapers singing and piping behind, and October 31st,  the eve of the Christian designated All Hallow Day, which then became  known as All Hallow Even, or Halloween. People dressed as demons,  hobgoblins, and witches to keep spirits away from possessing them. Trick  or treating began with Christian beggars asking for \"soul cake\" biscuits  in return for praying for dead relatives. Ticktacktoe and backgammon  were played.        There were riddles such as:            I am a strange creature, for I satisfy women ...     I grow very  tall, erect in a bed.     I'm hairy underneath. From time to time     A  beautiful girl, the brave daughter     Of some fellow dares to hold me    Grips my reddish skin, robs me of my head     And puts me in the  pantry. At once that girl     With plaited hair who has confined me  Remembers our meeting. Her eye moistens.     What am I?     An onion.            A man came walking where he knew     She stood in a corner, stepped  forwards;     The bold fellow plucked up his own     Skirt by hand,  stuck something stiff     Beneath her belt as she stood,     Worked his  will. They both wiggled.     The man hurried; his trusty helper  Plied a handy task, but tired     At length, less strong than she,  Weary of the work. Thick beneath     Her belt swelled the thing good men      Praise with their hearts and purses.     What am I?     A milk  churn.         The languages of invaders had produced a hybrid language that was  roughly understood throughout the country. The existence of Europe,  Africa, Asia, and India were known. Jerusalem was thought to be at the  center of the world. There was an annual tax of a penny on every hearth,  Peter's pence, to be collected and sent to the pope in Rome.  Ecclesiastical benefices were to pay church- scot, a payment in lieu of  first fruits of the land, to the pope.                                              - The Law -         The king and witan deliberated on the making of new laws, both secular  and spiritual, at the regularly held witanagemot. There was a standard  legal requirement of holding every man accountable, though expressed in  different ways, such as the following three:         Every freeman who does not hold land must find a lord to answer for  him. The act of homage was symbolized by holding his hands together  between those of his lord. Every lord shall be personally responsible as  surety for the men of his household.
