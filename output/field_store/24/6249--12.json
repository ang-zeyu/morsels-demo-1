The wool  often becomes injured by felting while it is on the sheep's back. This  is principally seen in the heavy breeds, especially those that are  neglected and half-starved, and generally begins in the winter season,  when the coat has been completely saturated with water, and it increases  until shearing-time, unless the cob separates from the wool beneath, and  drops off.    Wool is generally injured by keeping. It will probably increase a  little in weight for a few months, especially if kept in a damp place;  but after that it will somewhat rapidly become lighter, until a very  considerable loss will often be sustained. This, however, is not the  moral of the case; for, except very great care is taken, the moth will  get into the bundles and injure and destroy the staple; and that which  remains untouched by them will become considerably harsh and less  pliable. If to this the loss of the interest of money is added, it will  be seen that he seldom acts wisely who hoards his wool, when he can  obtain what approaches to a fair remunerating price for it.    _Softness_ of the wool is evidently connected with the presence and  quality of the yolk. This substance is undoubtedly designed not only to  nourish the hair, but to give it richness and pliability. The growth of  the yolk ought to be promoted, and agriculturists ought to pay more  attention to the quantity and quality of yolk possessed by the animals  selected for the purpose of breeding.    Bad management impairs the pliability of the wool, by arresting the  secretion of the yolk. The softness of the wool is also much influenced  by the chemical elements of the soil. A chalky soil notoriously  deteriorates it; minute particles of the chalk being necessarily brought  into contact with the fleece and mixing with it, have a corrosive effect  on the fibre, and harden it and render it less pliable. The particles of  chalk come in contact with the yolk--there being a chemical affinity  between the alkali and the oily matter of the yolk--immediately unite,  and a true soap is formed. The first storm washes a portion of it; and  the wool, deprived of its natural pabulum and unguent, loses some of its  vital properties--its pliability among the rest. The slight degree of  harshness which has been attributed to the English South-Down has been  explained in this way.    _The felting property_ of wool is a tendency of the fibres to entangle  themselves together, and to form a mass more or less difficult to  unravel. By moisture and pressure, the fibres of the wool may become  matted or felted together into a species of cloth. The manufacture of  felt was the first mode in which wool was applied to clothing, and felt  has long been in universal use for hats. The fulling of flannels and  broadcloths is effected by the felting principle. By the joint influence  of the moisture and the pressure, certain of the fibres are brought into  more intimate contact with each other; they adhere--not only the fibres,  but; in a manner, the threads--and the cloth is taken from the mill  shortened in all its dimensions; it has become a kind of felt, for the  threads have disappeared, and it can be cut in every direction with very  little or no unravelling; it is altogether a thicker, warmer, softer  fibre. This felting property is one of the most valuable qualities  possessed by wool, and on this property are the finer kinds of wool  especially valued by the manufacturer for the finest broadcloths. This  naturally suggests a consideration of the various forms in the structure  on which it depends.    The most evident distinction between the qualities of hair and wool is  the comparative straightness of the former, and _the crisped or  spirally-curling form_ which the latter assumes. If a little lock of  wool is held up to the light, every fibre of it is twisted into numerous  minute corkscrew-like ringlets. This is especially seen in the fleece of  the short-woolled sheeps; but, although less striking, it is obvious  even in wool of the largest staple.    The spirally-curving form of wool used, erroneously, to be considered as  the chief distinction between the covering of the goat and the sheep;  but the under-coat of some of the former is finer than that of any  sheep, and it is now acknowledged frequently to have the crisped and  curled appearance of wool. In some breeds of cattle, particularly in one  variety of the Devons, the hair assumes a curled and wavy appearance,  and a few of the minute spiral ringlets have been occasionally seen. It  is the same with many of the Highlands; but there is no determination to  take on the true crisped character, and throughout its whole extent, and  it is still nothing but hair. On some foreign breeds, however, as the  yak of Tartary, and the ox of Hudson's Bay, some fine and valuable wool  is produced.    There is an intimate connection between the fineness of the wool and the  number of the curves, at least in sheep yielding wool of nearly the same  length; so that, whether the wool of different sheep is examined, or  that from different parts of the same sheep, it is enough for the  observer to take advice of the number of curves in a given space, in  order to ascertain with sufficient accuracy the fineness of the fibre.    To this curled form of the wool not enough attention is, as a general  thing, paid by the breeder. It is, however, that on which its most  valuable uses depend. It is that which is essential to it in the  manufactory of cloths. The object of the carder is to break the wool in  pieces at the curves--the principle of the thread is the adhesion of the  particles together by their curves; and the fineness of the thread, and  consequent fineness of the cloth, will depend on the minuteness of  these curves, or the number of them found in a given length of fibre.    It will readily be seen that this curling form has much to do with the  felting property of wool; it materially contributes to that disposition  in the fibres which enables them to attach and intwine themselves  together; it multiplies the opportunities for this interlacing, and it  increases the difficulty of unravelling the felt.    The felting property of wool is the most important, as well as the  distinguishing one; but it varies essentially in different breeds, and  the usefulness and the consequent value of the fleece, for clothing  purposes, at least, depend on the degree to which it is pursued.    _The serrated_--notched, like the teeth of a saw--_edge_ of wool, which  has been discovered by means of the microscope, is also, as well as the  spiral curl, deemed an important quality in the felting property.  Repeated microscopic observations have removed all doubts as to the  general outline of the woolly fibre. It consists of a central stem or  stalk, probably hollow, or, at least, porous, possessing a  semi-transparency, not found in the fibre of hair. From this central  stalk there springs, at different distances, on different breeds of  sheep, a circlet of leaf-shaped projections.      LONG WOOL.    The most valuable of the long-woolled fleeces are of British origin. A  considerable quantity is produced in France and Belgium; but the  manufacturers in those countries acknowledge the superiority of the  British wool. Long wool is distinguished, as its name would import, by  the length of its staple, the average of which is about eight inches.  It was much improved, of late years, both in England and in other  countries. Its staple has, without detriment to its manufacturing  qualities, become shorter; but it has also become finer, truer, and  sounder. The long-woolled sheep has been improved more than any other  breed; and the principal error which Bakewell committed having been  repaired since his death, the long wool has progressively risen in  value, at least for curling purposes. Some of the breeds have staples of  double the length that has been mentioned as the average one. Pasture  and breeding are the powerful agents here.    Probably because the Leicester blood prevails in, or, at least, mingles  with, every other long-woolled breed, a great similarity in the  appearance and quality of this fleece has become apparent, of late  years, in every district of England. The short-woolled fleeces are, to a  very considerable degree, unlike in fineness, elasticity, and felting  property; the sheep themselves are still more unlike; but the long-wools  have, in a great degree, lost their distinctive points--the Lincoln, for  example, has not all of his former gaunt carcass, and coarse, entangled  wool--the Cotswold has become a variety of the Leicester--in fact, all  the long-woolled sheep, both in appearance and fleece, have almost  become of one variety; and rarely, except from culpable neglect in the  breeder, has the fleece been injuriously weakened, or too much  shortened, for the most valuable purposes to which it is devoted.    In addition to its length, this wool is characterized by its strength,  its transparency, its comparative stoutness, and the slight degree in  which it possesses the felting property. Since the extension of the  process of combing to wools of a shorter staple, the application of  this wool to manufacturing purposes has undergone considerable change.  In some respects, the range of its use has been limited; but its demand  has, on the whole, increased, and its value is more highly appreciated.  Indeed, there are certain important branches of the woollen manufacture,  such as worsted stuffs, bombazines, muslin-delaines, etc., in which it  can never be superseded; and its rapid extension in the United States,  within the past few years, clearly shows that a large and increasing  demand for this kind of wool will continue at remunerating prices.    This long wool is classed under two divisions, distinguished both by  length and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39235"],[0,"A Manual of Toy Dogs: How to breed, rear, and feed them (#13)"],[1,"ed-for toy dogs. In this, as in the dry,  severer forms of eczema, it is useless to attempt cure by mere outward  applications. The mischief is in the blood, and until the blood is put  right the external symptoms will continue, unless, indeed, strong  mercurial lotion or ointment be used, which may fatally drive the  disease in, and by clearing up the skin and so depriving the body of the  safety-valve of outward lesions, eventually kill the animal. Such a  proceeding is occasionally resorted to by unscrupulous persons whose  only desire is to sell their mangy or eczematous dogs, for the immediate  effect of dressing with mercurial ointment is often almost miraculously  good to the eye. Therefore, my advice to the amateur is, under no  circumstances to purchase a dog which is known to have suffered from any  severe form of skin disease. Even if the complaint has not been doctored  in the way described, and has been cured by honest methods, it may  always break out again, for it is in the constitution. I must, of  course, except cases in which contagious eczema has been given to the  victim by some other dog, but in dealing with strangers, shops, or  professional dealers, it is wisest to avoid a purchase where skin  disease has existed.    Some breeds are very much more subject to skin trouble than others, and  all long-haired dogs are apt to suffer from simple eczema and erythema,  the latter especially when young; while distemper of a severe kind is  often followed by a disease of the skin, closely resembling mange, for  which it is often unfortunately mistaken. It should be simply treated  with a mild antiseptic ointment, while the constitutional weakness is  the focus for attention.    Puppies often teeth with a rash, called puppy-pox, which shows as  general redness of the skin, generally on the bare parts of the body,  under the forelegs, etc., and here and there groups of pustules, each of  which contains a drop of thin pus. This is a complaint allied to  chicken-pox in children, and by no means dangerous--in fact, a puppy  which teethes with such a rash has generally the making of a strong and  healthy dog. At the same time, whenever either this trouble, or bare  patches about the legs and face, are seen on puppies, the teeth should  be looked to, for it is probable they are in some way irritating the  system.    The existence of too many worms in puppies generally accompanies skin  trouble in the form of bare patches, which may be well rubbed daily with  a sponge dipped in an extremely simple, safe, and useful lotion, which I  can recommend to be given a trial in all forms of skin disease, as in no  case can it do harm, while in many cases it will effect a cure so far as  any outward application is capable of doing. It is known as the  Kanofelin lotion, a preparation of phenyl, which is not irritating, or  in any way poisonous or disagreeable to the nose, but has a taste which  prevents dogs from licking it off; should they do so, however, it will  not harm them. The lotion, after being applied and well rubbed in with  the sponge to smooth, bare places, where the skin is not broken, should  be wiped off with a towel or handkerchief, as it is not wise to leave  the dog wet. It should be used twice a day, and where the skin is  broken, very gently with a soft sponge, and, of course, no rubbing in.    Some dry and scaly skin eruptions, of which pityriasis is the most  common, need different treatment. Where-ever bare places appearing on  the toy dog look scurfy, and scales fall off, do not use any lotion, nor  rub, but lightly dab on a little zinc ointment if the dog is not given  to licking the parts; if he is, use a plain, rather thin, sulphur  ointment: Sublimated sulphur, 1 oz.; vaseline, 4 ozs. This latter may  also be used in cases where the Kanofelin lotion is useful, and then be  well rubbed in; but the rule is no rubbing when scales or scurf are  present. The Kanofelin ointment is harmless and useful in all cases.  Applications can be much varied to suit cases, and where violent  irritation is present, it is sometimes necessary to use a more complex  preparation than those mentioned. The poisonous nature of some of the  ingredients, included in the most efficacious of them, however, makes it  very undesirable to use them otherwise than under the advice of a  skilled surgeon. The following cream is a most useful application for  use in cases where the skin is not broken, where great irritation and  redness of the skin are present, and where the affected parts either  cannot be reached by the patient, or the latter can be muzzled during  treatment. It is, however, poisonous, on account of the carbolic acid  and lead it contains: Liquor plumbi diacet., 4 drs.; liquor carbonis  detergens, 40 mns.; boracic acid powder, 1 oz.; new milk, to 4 ozs.  Shake well before use, and apply frequently with a bit of sponge. Label:  _Poison_.    In the treatment of medicated baths, usually composed of that most  evil-smelling compound liver of sulphur and water--in professional  language, \"a sulphuretted potash solution\"--I own I have little or no  faith. A plain sulphur ointment is twice as efficacious, far easier to  apply, and has no disagreeable smell; while, if well rubbed into the  skin, as it and other skin ointments should be, and not left in the  hair, it is not in any way unpleasant.    In all cases where skin trouble is accompanied by a strong and most  unpleasant smell, mange (either follicular, or, more commonly,  sarcoptic), may be suspected. The latter is easier to cure than many  forms of eczema, but it is absolutely needful to keep the patient  smothered in a dressing of sweet oil and sulphur, than which there is  nothing better, for several days, then to wash and dress again; and such  cases are not suitable for home treatment, although no veterinary  surgeon should be permitted to apply strong dressings like paraffin,  mercurial ointment, or tar (otherwise creosote) to delicate toys.  Mercurial dressings, in all cases, are rank poison, the absorption of  the drug into the system having fatal effects for the future.    Follicular mange, in which the insect causing the trouble burrows deep,  is a horrible disease, about the worst a dog can have, and here skilled  veterinary assistance cannot be dispensed with. But it is safe for the  amateur, in all cases of commencing skin trouble, where there is no  smell and the bare patches do not spread rapidly, to use the phenyl  lotion or sulphur or Kanofelin ointment, according to the state of the  skin, and to begin the more important internal treatment by a complete  change of diet.    A very dry or confined diet, certain meals, as oatmeal or Indian corn  meals, either in biscuits or otherwise; too little food; more rarely too  much; absence of meat from the dietary, or too little of it; as before,  but very rarely too much--these are all incentives to skin trouble,  while heredity has much to say to a tendency thereto.    A dog which has not been having much meat, but has been chiefly fed on  dog biscuit, may, on the appearance of skin irritation, be given plenty  of good, underdone meat--roast mutton, sheep's head, and bullock's  heart, all being very suitable. In no case of skin disease should either  oatmeal or Indian corn be given; and sea air should be avoided, as it is  always aggravating to skin troubles. Tripe is nourishing and very  digestible, and fresh fish suits most of the invalids very well.  Together with the entire change of diet--the hours for meals need not,  of course, be altered--a course of iron and cod liver oil is always well  worth trying. Personally, I pin my faith to the following method, which  I have known most successful in difficult cases, and which, as I can say  of the other remedies advised in this little book, can do no harm.  Powerful drugs are often a source of danger in inexperienced hands, and  a good many of the medicines one sees advised are, so to speak,  extremely speculative.    Get, then, a bottle of cod liver oil and malt, and 1 oz.--or more, if  you please--of saccharated carbonate of iron. In your pet's dinner mix,  at first, well covered over with cut-up meat of extra daintiness, a  scant half-teaspoonful of the solution with a dust of the iron, which is  a sweet powder. Nearly all dogs will take this without any trouble, and  soon get very fond of the oil, even if they object to it at first; but  they must not see the dose introduced into the meal. Let them think it  an accident, or at any rate, in the natural way of things, and they are  far less likely to object than if they see you making a parade of mixing  and covering. The dose, given twice a day, in meat dinner and supper,  should be gradually increased, until a dog of 6 lbs. is taking a full  teaspoonful of the solution twice a day, with 3 grs. of iron to each  dose; and patience will be needed, for, to do any good, this dosing must  go on for at least a month. It may then be left off gradually, and  resumed again if necessary. In obstinate cases of skin disease, arsenic  is a most valuable remedy, and may with most effect be combined with the  system of cod liver oil, malt extract, and saccharated carbonate of iron  just described. Fowler's solution, which is generally recommended,  should not be used, because it contains oil of lavender, which is very  offensive to dogs, and sickens them; the British Pharmacopoeia solution  should be the one used. Of this the dose is from one drop twice a day,  to be gradually increased up to four drops twice a day for toys; the  best way is to get the B.P. solution from your chemist, mixed with such  a quantity of distilled water as that there are four drops in each  teaspoonful. This may be given with iron and without the cod liver oil,  or with cod liver oil without the iron, or alone, in food--it is  tasteless--but is far better given in combination with the two.
