The wires W W are connected to the  telegraph line and to the commutator, a device which, when the operator  moves the handle H to right and left, keeps reversing the direction of  the current. The needles on both receiving and transmitting instruments  wag in accordance with the movements of the handle. One or more  movements form an alphabetical letter of the Morse code. Thus, if the  needle points first to left, and then to right, and comes to rest in a  normal position for a moment, the letter A is signified;  right-left-left-left in quick succession = B; right-left-right-left = C,  and so on. Where a marking instrument is used, a dot signifies a \"left,\"  and a dash a right; and if a \"sounder\" is employed, the operator judges  by the length of the intervals between the clicks.      INFLUENCE OF CURRENT ON A MAGNETIC NEEDLE.    [Illustration: FIGS. 55, 56.--The coils of a needle instrument. The  arrows show the direction taken by the current.]    Figs. 55 and 56 are two views of the coils and magnetic needle of the  Wheatstone instrument as they appear from behind. In Fig. 55 the current  enters the left-hand coil from the left, and travels round and round it  in a clockwise direction to the other end, whence it passes to the other  coil and away to the battery. Now, a coil through which a current passes  becomes a magnet. Its polarity depends on the direction in which the  current flows. Suppose that you are looking through the coil, and that  the current enters it from your end. If the wire is wound in a clockwise  direction, the S. pole will be nearest you; if in an anti-clockwise  direction, the N. pole. In Fig. 55 the N. poles are at the right end of  the coils, the S. poles at the left end; so the N. pole of the needle is  attracted to the right, and the S. pole to the left. When the current is  reversed, as in Fig. 56, the needle moves over. If no current passes, it  remains vertical.      METHOD OF REVERSING THE CURRENT.    [Illustration: FIG. 57.--General arrangement of needle-instrument  circuit. The shaded plates on the left (B and R) are in contact.]    A simple method of changing the direction of the current in a  two-instrument circuit is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 57. The  _principle_ is used in the Wheatstone needle instrument. The battery  terminals at each station are attached to two brass plates, A B, A^1  B^1. Crossing these at right angles (under A A^1 and over B B^1)  are the flat brass springs, L R, L^1 R^1, having buttons at their  lower ends, and fixed at their upper ends to baseboards. When at rest  they all press upwards against the plates A and A^1 respectively. R  and L^1 are connected with the line circuit, in which are the coils of  dials 1 and 2, one at each station. L and R^1 are connected with the  earth-plates E E^1. An operator at station 1 depresses R so as to  touch B. Current now flows from the battery to B, thence through R to  the line circuit, round the coils of both dials through L^1 A^1 and  R to earth-plate E^1, through the earth to E, and then back to the  battery through L and A. The needles assume the position shown. To  reverse the current the operator allows R to rise into contact with A,  and depresses L to touch B. The course can be traced out easily.    In the Wheatstone \"drop-handle\" instrument (Fig. 54) the commutator may  be described as an insulated core on which are two short lengths of  brass tubing. One of these has rubbing against it a spring connected  with the + terminal of the battery; the other has similar communication  with the - terminal. Projecting from each tube is a spike, and rising  from the baseboard are four upright brass strips not quite touching the  commutator. Those on one side lead to the line circuit, those on the  other to the earth-plate. When the handle is turned one way, the spikes  touch the forward line strip and the rear earth strip, and _vice versa_  when moved in the opposite direction.      SOUNDING INSTRUMENTS.    Sometimes little brass strips are attached to the dial plate of a needle  instrument for the needle to strike against. As these give different  notes, the operator can comprehend the message by ear alone. But the  most widely used sounding instrument is the Morse sounder, named after  its inventor. For this a reversible current is not needed. The receiver  is merely an electro-magnet (connected with the line circuit and an  earth-plate) which, when a current passes, attracts a little iron bar  attached to the middle of a pivoted lever. The free end of the lever  works between two stops. Every time the circuit is closed by the  transmitting key at the sending station the lever flies down against the  lower stop, to rise again when the circuit is broken. The duration of  its stay decides whether a \"long\" or \"short\" is meant.      TELEGRAPHIC RELAYS.    [Illustration: FIG. 58.--Section of a telegraph wire insulator on its  arm. The shaded circle is the line wire, the two blank circles indicate  the wire which ties the line wire to the insulator.]    When an electric current has travelled for a long distance through a  wire its strength is much reduced on account of the resistance of the  wire, and may be insufficient to cause the electro-magnet of the sounder  to move the heavy lever. Instead, therefore, of the current acting  directly on the sounder magnet, it is used to energize a small magnet,  or _relay_, which pulls down a light bar and closes a second \"local\"  circuit--that is, one at the receiver end--worked by a separate battery,  which has sufficient power to operate the sounder.      RECORDING TELEGRAPHS.    By attaching a small wheel to the end of a Morse-sounder lever, by  arranging an ink-well for the wheel to dip into when the end falls, and  by moving a paper ribbon slowly along for the wheel to press against  when it rises, a self-recording Morse inker is produced. The  ribbon-feeding apparatus is set in motion automatically by the current,  and continues to pull the ribbon along until the message is completed.    The Hughes type-printer covers a sheet of paper with printed characters  in bold Roman type. The transmitter has a keyboard, on which are marked  letters, signs, and numbers; also a type-wheel, with the characters on  its circumference, rotated by electricity. The receiver contains  mechanisms for rotating another type-wheel synchronously--that is, in  time--with the first; for shifting the wheel across the paper; for  pressing the paper against the wheel; and for moving the paper when a  fresh line is needed. These are too complicated to be described here in  detail. By means of relays one transmitter may be made to work five  hundred receivers. In London a single operator, controlling a keyboard  in the central dispatching office, causes typewritten messages to spell  themselves out simultaneously in machines distributed all over the  metropolis.    The tape machine resembles that just described in many details. The main  difference is that it prints on a continuous ribbon instead of on  sheets.    Automatic electric printers of some kind or other are to be found in  the vestibules of all the principal hotels and clubs of our large  cities, and in the offices of bankers, stockbrokers, and newspaper  editors. In London alone over 500 million words are printed by the  receivers in a year.      HIGH-SPEED TELEGRAPHY.    At certain seasons, or when important political events are taking place,  the telegraph service would become congested with news were there not  some means of transmitting messages at a much greater speed than is  possible by hand signalling. Fifty words a minute is about the limit  speed that a good operator can maintain. By means of Wheatstone's  _automatic transmitter_ the rate can be increased to 400 words per  minute. Paper ribbons are punched in special machines by a number of  clerks with a series of holes which by their position indicate a dot or  a dash. The ribbons are passed through a special transmitter, over  little electric brushes, which make contact through the holes with  surfaces connected to the line circuit. At the receiver end the message  is printed by a Morse inker.    It has been found possible to send several messages simultaneously over  a single line. To effect this a _distributer_ is used to put a number of  transmitters at one end of the line in communication with an equal  number of receivers at the other end, fed by a second distributer  keeping perfect time with the first. Instead of a signal coming as a  whole to any one instrument it arrives in little bits, but these follow  one another so closely as to be practically continuous. By working a  number of automatic transmitters through a distributer, a thousand words  or more per minute are easily dispatched over a single wire.    The Pollak Virag system employs a punched ribbon, and the receiver  traces out the message in alphabetical characters on a moving strip of  sensitized photographic paper. A mirror attached to a vibrating  diaphragm reflects light from a lamp on to the strip, which is  automatically developed and fixed in chemical baths. The method of  moving the mirror so as to make the rays trace out words is extremely  ingenious. Messages have been transmitted by this system at the rate of  180,000 words per hour.          Chapter VII.    WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.         The transmitting apparatus--The receiving apparatus--Syntonic       transmission--The advance of wireless telegraphy.      In our last chapter we reviewed briefly some systems of sending  telegraphic messages from one point of the earth's surface to another  through a circuit consisting partly of an insulated wire and partly of  the earth itself. The metallic portion of a long circuit, especially if  it be a submarine cable, is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28569"],[0,"Makers of Many Things (#13)"],[1,"a small  order, but it will bring you nine or ten thousand eggs, ready to  become sturdy little silkworms if all goes well with them. Put them on  a table with a top of wire netting covered with brown paper, and keep  them comfortably warm. In a week or two, there will appear some little  worms about an eighth of an inch long and covered with black hairs.  These tiny worms have to become three inches or more in length, and  they are expected to accomplish the feat in about a month. If a boy  four feet tall should grow at the silkworm's rate for one month, he  would become forty-eight feet tall. It is no wonder that the worms  have to make a business of eating, or that the keeper has to make a  business of providing them with food. They eat most of the time, and  they make a queer little crackling sound while they are about it. They  have from four to eight meals a day of mulberry leaves. The worms from  a quarter of an ounce of eggs begin with one pound a day, and work up  to between forty and fifty. Silkworms like plenty of fresh air, and if  they are to thrive, their table must be kept clean. A good way to  manage this is to put over them paper full of holes large enough for  them to climb through. Lay the leaves upon the paper; the worms will  come up through the holes to eat, and the litter on their table can  be cleared away. As the worms grow larger, the holes must be made  larger. It is no wonder that their skins soon become too tight for  them. They actually lose their appetite for a day or two, and they  slip away to some quiet corner under the leaves, and plainly wish  there were no other worms to bother them. Soon the skin comes off,  and they make up for lost time so energetically that they have to drop  their tight skins three times more before they are fully grown. Wet  mulberry leaves must not be given them, or they will become sick and  die, and there will be an end of the silkworm business from that  quarter-ounce of eggs. They must have plenty of room on their table as  well as in their skins. At first a tray or table two feet long and a  little more than one foot wide will be large enough; but when they are  full-grown, they will need about eighty square feet of table or  shelves. At spinning time, even this will not be enough.    After the worms have shed their skins four times and then eaten as  much as they possibly can for eight or ten days, they begin to feel  as if they had had enough. They now eat very little and really become  smaller. They are restless and wander about. Now and then they throw  out threads of silk as fine as a spider's web. They know exactly what  they want; each little worm wants to make a cocoon, and all they ask  of you is to give them the right sort of place to make it in. When  they live out of doors in freedom, they fasten their cocoons to twigs;  and if you wish to give them what they like best, get plenty of dry  twigs and weave them together in arches standing over the shelves.  Pretty soon you will see one worm after another climb up the twigs and  select a place for its cocoon. Before long it throws out threads from  its spinneret, a tiny opening near the mouth, and makes a kind of net  to support the cocoon which it is about to weave.    The silkworm may have seemed greedy, but he did not eat one leaf too  much for the task that lies before him. There is nothing lazy about  him; and now he works with all his might, making his cocoon. He begins  at the outside and shapes it like a particularly plump peanut of a  clear, pale yellow. The silk is stiffened with a sort of gum as it  comes out of the spinneret. The busy little worm works away, laying  its threads in place in the form of a figure eight. For some time the  cocoon is so thin that one can watch him. It is calculated that his  tiny head makes sixty-nine movements every minute.    The covering grows thicker and the room for the silkworm grows  smaller. After about seventy-two hours, put your ear to the cocoon,  and if all is quiet within, it is completed and the worm is shut up  within it. Strange things happen to him while he sleeps in the quiet  of his silken bed, for he becomes a dry brown chrysalis without head  or feet. Then other things even more marvelous come to pass, for in  about three weeks the little creature pushes the threads apart at one  end of the cocoon and comes out, not a silkworm at all, but a moth  with head and wings and legs and eyes. This moth lays hundreds of  eggs, and in less than three weeks it dies.    This is what the silkworm will do if it is left alone; but it is the  business of the silk-raiser to see that it is not left alone. About  eight days after the cocoon is begun, it is steamed or baked to kill  the chrysalis so that it cannot make its way out and so spoil the  silk. The quarter of an ounce of eggs will make about thirty pounds  of cocoons. Now is the time to be specially watchful, for there is  nothing in which rats and mice so delight as a plump, sweet chrysalis;  and they care nothing whatever for the three or four thousand yards of  silk that is wound about each one.    To take this silk off is a delicate piece of work. A single fiber is  not much larger than the thread of a cobweb, and before the silk can  be used, several threads must be united in one. First, the cocoon is  soaked in warm water to loosen the gum that the worm used to stick its  threads together. Ends of silk from half a dozen or more cocoons are  brought together, run through a little hole in a guide, and wound on a  reel as one thread. This needs skill and practice, for the reeled silk  must be kept of the same size. The cocoon thread is so slender that,  of course, it breaks very easily; and when this happens, another  thread must be pieced on. Then, too, the inner silk of the cocoon is  finer than the outer; so unless care is taken to add threads, the  reeled silk will be irregular. The water must also be kept just warm  enough to soften the gum, but not too hot.    The silk is taken off the reel, and the skeins are packed up in bales  as if it were of no more value than cotton. Indeed, it does not look  nearly so pretty and attractive as a lap of pure white cotton, for it  is stiff and gummy and has hardly any luster. Now it is sent to the  manufacturer. It is soaked in hot soapy water for several hours, and  it is drawn between plates so close together that, while they allow  the silk to go through, they will not permit the least bit of  roughness or dirt to pass. If the thread breaks, a tiny \"faller,\" such  as are used in cotton mills, falls down and stops the machine. The  silk must now be twisted, subjected to two or three processes to  increase its luster, and dyed,--and if you would like to feel as if  you were paying a visit to a rainbow, go into a mill and watch the  looms with their smooth, brilliant silks of all the colors that can  be imagined. After the silk is woven, it is polished on lustering  machines, singed to destroy all bits of free fibers or lint, freed of  all threads that may project, and scoured if it is of a light color;  then sold.    [Illustration: _Courtesy Cheney Bros._    HOW SPUN SILK IS MADE    Every manufacturer saves everything he can, and even the waste silk  which cannot be wound on reels is turned into a salable product]    The moth whose cocoon provides most of our silk is called the \"bombyx  mori.\" There are others, however, and from some of these tussah silk,  Yamamai, and Shantung pongee are woven. These wild moths produce a  stronger thread, but it is much less smooth than that of the bombyx.    There is also a great amount of \"wood silk,\" or artificial silk, on  the market. To make this, wood pulp is dissolved in ether and squirted  through fine jets into water. It is soon hard enough to be twisted  into threads and woven. It makes an imitation of silk, bright and  lustrous, but not wearing so well as the silk of the silkworm.  Nevertheless, for many purposes it is used as a substitute for silk,  and many braids and passementeries are made of it. Then, too, there  are the \"mercerized\" goods, which often closely resemble real silk,  although there is not a thread of silk in them. It was discovered many  years ago that if a piece of cotton cloth was boiled in caustic soda,  it would become soft and thick and better able to receive delicate  dyes. Unfortunately, it also shrank badly. At length it occurred to  some one that the cloth might be kept from shrinking by being  stretched out during the boiling in soda. He was delighted to find  that this process made it more brilliant than many silks.    The threads that fasten the cocoon to the bush and those in the heart  of the cocoon are often used, together with the fiber from any cocoons  through which the worms have made their way out. This is real silk, of  course, but it is made of short fibers which cannot be wound. It is  carded and spun and made into fabric called \"spun silk,\" which is used  extensively for the heavier classes of goods. Then, too, silks are  often \"weighted\"; that is, just before they are dyed, salts of iron or  tin are added. One pound of silk will absorb two or three pounds of  these chemicals, and will apparently be a heavy silk, while it is  really thin and poor. Moreover, this metallic weighting rubs against  the silk fiber and mysterious holes soon begin to appear. A wise \"dry  cleaner\" will have nothing to do with such silks, lest he should be  held responsible for these holes. It is this weighting which produces  the peculiar rustle of taffeta; and if women would be satisfied with  a taffeta that was soft and thin, the manufacturers would gladly leave  out the salts of iron, and the silks would wear much better. Cotton  is seldom mixed with the silk warp thread; but it is used as \"filling\"  in a large class of goods with silk warp. The custom has arisen of  advertising such goods as \"silk,\" which of course is not a fair  description of them. Advertisements"]]]
