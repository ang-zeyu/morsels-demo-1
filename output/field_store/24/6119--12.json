[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30889"],[0,"The Mechanism of the Human Voice (#13)"],[1,"the female voice has three registers--_i.e._, the  Thick, the Thin, and the Small. From this it follows that the female  voice is _not_, as supposed by some, simply a reproduction of the male  an octave higher.    I have spoken of the above results of the investigations with the  laryngoscope as startling, because the female voicebox is generally  imagined to be exactly like the male, save in size, and the inference  that the female voice must be exactly like the male, save in pitch, is,  therefore, a very natural one. Neither am I surprised that those who  hold an opposite view to mine are never tired of advancing this  argument.         Mr. Lunn says, in the book quoted before, on page 24, \"Consequently       it may safely be asserted that the vocal cords are subject to the       same laws as all sounding bodies, and as the sole difference       between the male and the female larynx is one of size alone, the       voice from the latter _is_ a reproduction of the former on a higher       scale.\"    I have, however, shown by the measurements of Luschka, on p. 64, that  the proportions of the female voicebox are materially different from  those of the male, and I have also pointed out differences in shape  noticeable to any observer. Now, although I do not pretend that I have  by these facts and figures sufficiently accounted for the difference in  the registers of the male and the female voice; yet these facts and  figures are nevertheless greatly in my favour, and they are certainly a  sufficient answer to the above argument of those who differ from me.    My case is further strengthened by the testimony of that eminent  physiologist, Dr. Merkel, who says,[N] \"In the male organ there are only  two materially different registers to be noticed, the chest and the  falsetto, ... on the other hand, in the female organ there are clearly  to be distinguished three registers--a low, a medium, and a high.\" (From  Dr. Merkel's definitions on pp. 148, 149, and 152, it will be seen that  low, medium, and high, are but other names here employed for Thick,  Thin, and Small.) Dr. Merkel, speaking of the chest (thick) register,  goes on to observe, on p. 148, \"It ceases, very curiously, in both sexes  on one of the first four tones of the one-lined octave (der  ein-gestrichenen Octave) [Illustration: musical notation] so that it is  about one octave longer [deeper] in man than in woman.\"    Let it be observed above all things that I am not propounding a theory,  but explaining a fact; a fact, moreover, which I have before now  demonstrated to men holding opposite opinions, thereby convincing them,  and which I am willing at any moment to demonstrate again. A very  striking proof that the distribution of the registers is in accordance  with my explanations may be further found in the circumstance that it is  often impossible to distinguish a male voice from a female when (other  things such as power and quality being equal) both sing in the same  registers. The similarity is, of course, greatest between tenor and  contralto, and in case of a trial they must confine themselves to the  compass easily belonging to both; neither should the singers be seen by  the listeners. I have frequently by these experiments convinced  sceptics; and it has happened more than once when the female voice was  slightly more robust than the male, that, to the great amusement of  those present, the judges emphatically and without the slightest  hesitation pronounced the lady to be the tenor and the gentleman the  contralto.           *       *       *       *       *    We have so far only spoken of three registers, the Thick, below  [Illustration: musical notation]; the Thin, between [Illustration: Music  and]; and the Small, above [Illustration: musical notation]. The  distinguishing features of these are so very clear as to make any  mistake impossible. But now we come to sub-divisions, and with regard to  these the matter is not so simple. Singers know very well that other  breaks occur in the human voice besides those hitherto mentioned, and  the question arises how they are to be accounted for by corresponding  changes in the vocal organ. The evidence furnished on this point by the  laryngoscope is, in my opinion, not sufficient, because the alterations  in the vocal ligaments are so exceedingly minute as to be capable of  being differently interpreted by different observers. I have  consequently come to the conclusion that they cannot be accepted as  indicating changes of mechanism unless corroborated and amplified by  other signs.    In order to place the whole subject before the reader in a comprehensive  form, I cannot do better than quote the elaborate description which  Madame Emma Seiler gives of the registers in \"The Human Voice in  Singing\" (Philadelphia, 1875). Madame Seiler, to whom Mr. Lunn is  pleased to refer, on p. 65 of his treatise, as an \"ignorant person,\"  assisted Professor Helmholtz, of Heidelberg, in his essay upon the  Formation of the Vowel-tones and the Registers of the Female Voice. He  says he thus had \"an opportunity of knowing the delicacy of her musical  ear, and her ability to master the more difficult and abstract parts of  the theory of music.\" The Professor further speaks of her as \"a very  careful, skilled, and learned teacher.\" Professor Du Bois-Reymond, of  Berlin, also describes her as \"a lady of truly remarkable attainments.\"  With such recommendations I make no apology for quoting at length from  Madame Seiler's writings; and it will be readily understood that  whenever I differ from her, I do so with some diffidence, and only after  careful conviction of the accuracy of my own independent observations.    [Illustration]    I shall substitute the terms hitherto used in these pages for others  employed by Madame Seiler, and I have added a diagram of the  registers, which may assist the reader in forming a clear idea of the  subject.      THE THICK REGISTER.    \"When the vowel A, as in 'man,' was sung, I could, after long-continued  practice, plainly see how the pyramids quickly rose with their summits  in their mucous membranous case and approached to mutual contact. In  like manner the vocal ligaments approached each other so closely that  scarcely any space between them was observable. The pocket ligaments  formed the ellipse described by Garcia in the upper part of the  glottis.\"    The word \"glottis\" really signifies the vibrating element in the  voicebox. I suppose, therefore, that by \"the upper part of the glottis\"  Madame Seiler here means the \"part above the glottis.\"    \"When, in using the laryngoscope upon myself, I slowly sang the  ascending scale, this movement of the vocal ligaments and pyramids was  repeated at every tone. They separated and appeared to retreat, in order  to close again anew, and to rise somewhat more than before. This  movement of the pyramids may best be compared to that of a pair of  scissors. With every higher tone the vocal ligaments seemed more  stretched, and the vocal chink somewhat shorter. At the same time, when  I sang the scale upward, beginning with the lowest tones, the vocal  ligaments seemed to be moved in their whole length and breadth by large,  loose vibrations, which extended even to all the rest of the interior of  the voicebox.           *       *       *       *       *    \"The place at which the pyramids, almost closed together, cease their  action and leave the formation of the sound to the vocal ligaments  alone, I found in the thick register of the female voice at C, C[#]  [Illustration: musical notation], more rarely at B [Illustration:  musical notation]. In the thick register of the male voice this change  occurs at A, B[b] [Illustration: musical notation]. With some effort the  above-mentioned action of the pyramids may be continued several tones  higher. But such tones, especially in the female voice, have that rough  and common timbre which we are too often compelled to hear in our female  singers. The glottis also, in this case, as well as the parts of the  voicebox near the glottis, betrays the effort very plainly; as the tones  ascend, the glottis and the surrounding parts grow more and more red.  _As at this place in the thick register there occurs a visible and  sensible straining of the organs, so also is it in all the remaining  transitions, as soon as the attempt is made to extend the action by  which the lower tones are formed beyond the given limits of the same._  These transitions, which cannot be extended without effort, coincide  perfectly with the places where J. Mueller had to _stretch_ the ligaments  of his exsected voicebox so powerfully in order to reach the succeeding  half-tone. Garcia likewise finds tones thus formed disagreeable and  imperfect in sound.    \"Usually, therefore, at the note C[#] [Illustration: musical notation]  in the female voice, and A, B[b] [Illustration: musical notation] in the  male voice, the vocal ligaments alone act in forming the sound, and are  throughout the register moved by large, loose, full vibrations. But the  instant the vocal ligaments are deprived of the assistance of the  pyramids they relax, and appear longer than at the last tone produced by  that aid. But with every higher tone they appear again to be stretched  shorter and more powerfully up to F, F[#] [Illustration: musical  notation] the natural transition from the thick to the thin register, as  well in the _male_ as in the _female_. The voicebox is perceptibly lower  in all the tones of the thick register than in quiet breathing.\"    I confess my inability to understand how the vocal ligaments can get  _longer_ by relaxing and _shorter_ by stretching. But apart from this I  assert that there is no relaxing of the vocal ligaments at the break  between the Lower Thick and the Upper Thick at all. This is clearly  proved by the ring-shield aperture, which would open immediately if such  were the case. I also doubt whether"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3095"],[0,"The Lady of the Shroud (#13)"],[1," it, I only      wish I had known, or even suspected, the sort of man he was, and how      he cared for me, and I would sometimes have come back to see him, if      I had to come half round the world.  Well, all I can do now is to      carry out his wishes; that will be my expiation for my neglect.  He      knew what he wanted exactly, and I suppose I shall come in time to      know it all and understand it, too.        I was thinking something like this when Mr. Trent began to talk, so      that all he said fitted exactly into my own thought.  The two men      were evidently great friends--I should have gathered that, anyhow,      from the Will--and the letters--so I was not surprised when Mr. Trent      told me that they had been to school together, Uncle Roger being a      senior when he was a junior; and had then and ever after shared each      other's confidence.  Mr. Trent, I gathered, had from the very first      been in love with my mother, even when she was a little girl; but he      was poor and shy, and did not like to speak.  When he had made up his      mind to do so, he found that she had by then met my father, and could      not help seeing that they loved each other.  So he was silent.  He      told me he had never said a word about it to anyone--not even to my      Uncle Roger, though he knew from one thing and another, though he      never spoke of it, that he would like it.  I could not help seeing      that the dear old man regarded me in a sort of parental way--I have      heard of such romantic attachments being transferred to the later      generation.  I was not displeased with it; on the contrary, I liked      him better for it.  I love my mother so much--I always think of her      in the present--that I cannot think of her as dead.  There is a tie      between anyone else who loved her and myself.  I tried to let Mr.      Trent see that I liked him, and it pleased him so much that I could      see his liking for me growing greater.  Before we parted he told me      that he was going to give up business.  He must have understood how      disappointed I was--for how could I ever get along at all without      him?--for he said, as he laid a hand quite affectionately, I      thought--on my shoulder:        \"I shall have one client, though, whose business I always hope to      keep, and for whom I shall be always whilst I live glad to act--if he      will have me.\"  I did not care to speak as I took his hand.  He      squeezed mine, too, and said very earnestly:        \"I served your uncle's interests to the very best of my ability for      nearly fifty years.  He had full confidence in me, and I was proud of      his trust.  I can honestly say, Rupert--you won't mind me using that      familiarity, will you?--that, though the interests which I guarded      were so vast that without abusing my trust I could often have used my      knowledge to my personal advantage, I never once, in little matters      or big, abused that trust--no, not even rubbed the bloom off it.  And      now that he has remembered me in his Will so generously that I need      work no more, it will be a very genuine pleasure and pride to me to      carry out as well as I can the wishes that I partly knew, and now      realize more fully towards you, his nephew.\"        In the long chat which we had, and which lasted till midnight, he      told me many very interesting things about Uncle Roger.  When, in the      course of conversation, he mentioned that the fortune Uncle Roger      left must be well over a hundred millions, I was so surprised that I      said out loud--I did not mean to ask a question:        \"How on earth could a man beginning with nothing realize such a      gigantic fortune?\"        \"By all honest ways,\" he answered, \"and his clever human insight.  He      knew one half of the world, and so kept abreast of all public and      national movements that he knew the critical moment to advance money      required.  He was always generous, and always on the side of freedom.      There are nations at this moment only now entering on the      consolidation of their liberty, who owe all to him, who knew when and      how to help.  No wonder that in some lands they will drink to his      memory on great occasions as they used to drink his health.\"        \"As you and I shall do now, sir!\" I said, as I filled my glass and      stood up.  We drank it in bumpers.  We did not say a word, either of      us; but the old gentleman held out his hand, and I took it.  And so,      holding hands, we drank in silence.  It made me feel quite choky; and      I could see that he, too, was moved.    _From E. B. Trent's Memoranda_.                                                            _January_ 4, 1907.        I asked Mr. Rupert Sent Leger to dine with me at my office alone, as      I wished to have a chat with him.  To-morrow Sir Colin and I will      have a formal meeting with him for the settlement of affairs, but I      thought it best to have an informal talk with him alone first, as I      wished to tell him certain matters which will make our meeting      to-morrow more productive of utility, as he can now have more full      understanding of the subjects which we have to discuss.  Sir Colin is      all that can be in manhood, and I could wish no better colleague in      the executorship of this phenomenal Will; but he has not had the      privilege of a lifelong friendship with the testator as I have had.      And as Rupert Sent Leger had to learn intimate details regarding his      uncle, I could best make my confidences alone.  To-morrow we shall      have plenty of formality.  I was delighted with Rupert.  He is just      what I could have wished his mother's boy to be--or a son of my own      to be, had I had the good-fortune to have been a father.  But this is      not for me.  I remember long, long ago reading a passage in Lamb's      Essays which hangs in my mind: \"The children of Alice call Bartrum      father.\"  Some of my old friends would laugh to see _me_ write this,      but these memoranda are for my eyes alone, and no one shall see them      till after my death, unless by my own permission.  The boy takes some      qualities after his father; he has a daring that is disturbing to an      old dryasdust lawyer like me.  But somehow I like him more than I      ever liked anyone--any man--in my life--more even than his uncle, my      old friend, Roger Melton; and Lord knows I had much cause to like      him.  I have more than ever now.  It was quite delightful to see the      way the young adventurer was touched by his uncle's thought of him.      He is a truly gallant fellow, but venturesome exploits have not      affected the goodness of heart.  It is a pleasure to me to think that      Roger and Colin came together apropos of the boy's thoughtful      generosity towards Miss MacKelpie.  The old soldier will be a good      friend to him, or I am much mistaken.  With an old lawyer like me,      and an old soldier like him, and a real old gentlewoman like Miss      MacKelpie, who loves the very ground he walks on, to look after him,      together with all his own fine qualities and his marvellous      experience of the world, and the gigantic wealth that will surely be      his, that young man will go far.    _Letter from Rupert Sent Leger to Miss Janet MacKelpie_, _Croom_.                                                            _January_ 5, 1907.        MY DEAREST AUNT JANET,        It is all over--the first stage of it; and that is as far as I can      get at present.  I shall have to wait for a few days--or it may be      weeks--in London for the doing of certain things now necessitated by      my acceptance of Uncle Roger's bequest.  But as soon as I can, dear,      I shall come down to Croom and spend with you as many days as      possible.  I shall then tell you all I am at liberty to tell, and I      shall thank you personally for your consent to come with me to      Vissarion.  Oh, how I wish my dear mother had lived to be with us!      It would have made her happy, I know, to have come; and then we three      who shared together the old dear, hard days would have shared in the      same way the new splendour.  I would try to show all my love and      gratitude to you both . . . You must take the whole burden of it now,      dear, for you and I are alone.  No, not alone, as we used to be, for      I have now two old friends who are already dear to me.  One is so to      you already.  Sir Colin is simply splendid, and so, in his own way,      is Mr. Trent.  I am lucky, Aunt Janet, to have two such men to think      of affairs for me.  Am I not?  I shall send you a wire as soon as      ever I can see my way to get through my work; and I want you to think      over all the things you ever wished for in your life, so that I      may--if there is any mortal way of doing so--get them for you.  You      will not stand in the way of my having this great pleasure, will you,      dear?  Good-bye.                                                                   Your loving                                                                     RUPERT.    _E. B. Trent's Memoranda_.                                                            _January_ 6, 1907.        The formal meeting of Sir Colin and myself with Rupert Sent Leger      went off quite satisfactorily.  From what he had said yesterday, and      again last night, I had almost come to expect an unreserved      acceptance of everything stated or implied in Roger Melton's Will;      but when we had sat round the table--this appeared, by the way, to be      a formality for which we were all prepared, for we sat down as if by      instinct--the very first words he said were:        \"As I suppose I must go through this formality, I may as well say at      once that I accept every possible condition which was in the mind of      Uncle Roger; and to"]]]
