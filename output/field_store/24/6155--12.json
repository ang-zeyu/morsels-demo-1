My wife and I have helped him much.\"    The finale was triumphal. The multitude rushed impetuously upon  Juanillo, as if they were about to devour him by their outbursts of  enthusiasm. Fortunately the brother-in-law was present to impose order,  to shield him with his body, and to conduct him to the hired coach in  which he seated himself at the bull-fighter's side.    When they arrived at the house in the ward of the Feria an immense crowd  was following the carriage with shouts of joy and acclamations of praise  that brought the people crowding to the doors. The news of the triumph  had reached there ahead of the swordsman and the neighbors ran out to  see him and to press his hand.    Senora Angustias and her daughter were at the door. The leather-worker  stepped out almost arm in arm with his brother-in-law, monopolizing him,  shouting and gesticulating in the name of the family that nobody should  touch him, as if he were a sick man.    \"Here he is, Encarnacion,\" he said, shoving him toward his wife, \"Not  even Roger de Flor himself--\"    And Encarnacion had no need to ask more, for she knew that her husband  vaguely considered this historic individual the personification of all  greatness and that he only ventured to connect his name with portentous  circumstances.    Certain enthusiastic neighbors who came from the _corrida_ flattered  Senora Angustias, crying, \"Blessed be the mother that has given birth to  such a valiant youth!\"    Her friends overwhelmed her with their exclamations. What luck! And what  sums of money he soon was going to earn!    The poor woman wore in her eyes an expression of astonishment and doubt.  And was it really her little Juan that had made the people run with such  enthusiasm? Had they gone mad?    But she suddenly fell upon him as if all the past had vanished; as if  her worry and fretting were a dream; as if she confessed a shameful  error. Her great flabby arms wound around the bull-fighter's neck and  her tears wetted his cheeks.    \"My son! Little Juan! If thy poor father could only see thee!\"    \"Don't cry, mother--for this is a day of joy. You shall see. If God  gives me luck I will build you a house and your friends shall see you in  a carriage and you shall wear all the Manila shawls you want.\"    The leather-worker received these promises of greatness with signs of  affirmation in the presence of his astonished wife, who had not yet  recovered from her surprise at this radical change.    \"Yes, Encarnacion; this youth will do it all if he undertakes it. It was  extraordinary. Not even Roger de Flor himself--!\"    That night in the taverns and _cafes_ of the popular wards they talked  only of Gallardo. The bull-fighter of the future! He has flourished like  the very roses. This boy is going to get away the favors from all the  Cordovan caliphs.    In these assertions was revealed Sevillian pride in constant rivalry  with the people of Cordova, which was also a land of good bull-fighters.    Gallardo's existence changed completely from this day. The young  gentlemen greeted him and made him sit among them around the doors of  the _cafes_. The pretty girls who formerly satisfied his hunger and took  care of his adornment, found themselves little by little repelled with  smiling disregard. Even the old protector prudently withdrew in view of  a certain indifference and bestowed his tender friendship on other boys  who were just beginning.    The management of the bull-plaza sought out Gallardo, humoring him as if  he were already a celebrity. By announcing his name on the programmes  success was assured, the plaza filled. The masses applauded wildly the  \"boy of Senora Angustias,\" giving tongue to tales of his valor.  Gallardo's fame extended through Andalusia, and the leather-worker,  without being solicited, mixed in everything and played the part of  defender of his brother-in-law's interests. A thoughtful and expert man  in business, according to himself, he saw the course of his life marked  out.    \"Thy brother,\" he would say to his wife at night as they went to bed,  \"needs a practical man at his side to manage his interests. Dost thou  suppose he would think well of naming me his manager? A great thing for  him! Not even Roger de Flor himself! And for us--?\"    The leather-worker contemplated in imagination the great riches Gallardo  was going to gain, and he thought also of his own five sons and those  that were still to come. Who could tell if what the swordsman earned  should fall to his nephews?    For a year and a half Juan killed bullocks in the best plazas of Spain.  His fame had reached Madrid. The devotees at the capital felt a  curiosity to see the \"Sevillian boy\" of whom the newspapers talked so  much and of whom the \"intelligent\" Andalusians boasted.    Gallardo, escorted by a group of friends from his native city who were  residing in Madrid, strutted along the sidewalk of Seville Street near  the Cafe Ingles. The pretty girls smiled at his compliments and their  eyes followed the toreador's heavy gold chain and his big diamond  ornaments acquired with his first earnings and on credit--discounting  the future. A _matador_ must show that he has an overplus of money by  decorating his person and treating everybody generously. How far away  were those days when he, with poor Chiripa, tramped along that same  pavement, afraid of the police, contemplating the bull-fighters with  admiration and picking up the stubs of their cigars!    His work in Madrid was lucky. He made friends and formed around him a  group of enthusiasts hungry for novelty who also proclaimed him the  \"bull-fighter of the future\" and complained because he had not yet  received the \"alternative.\"    \"He's going to earn money by basketfuls, Encarnacion,\" said the  brother-in-law. \"He is going to have millions, if he doesn't have some  bad luck.\"    The life of the family changed completely. Gallardo, mingling with the  young gentlemen of Seville, did not wish his mother to continue living  in the house where she had passed her days of poverty. On his account  they had moved to a better street in the city, but Senora Angustias  inclined to remain faithful to the ward of the Feria, with the love  which simple people feel as they grow old for the places where their  youth was spent.    They lived in a much better house. The mother did not work and the  neighbors paid her homage, finding in her a generous lender in their  days of stress. Juan possessed, besides the loud and showy jewels with  which he adorned his person, that supreme luxury of every bull-fighter,  a powerful sorrel mare, with a cowboy saddle and a fine blanket bordered  with multicolored fringe across the pommel. Mounted on her he trotted  along the streets with no other object than to receive the homage of his  friends, who greeted his elegance with noisy _\"Oles!\"_ This satisfied  his desire for popularity for the moment. On other occasions he rode  with the young bloods, forming a sightly troop of horsemen, to the  pasture of Tablada, on the eve of a great _corrida_, to see the herd  that others had to kill.    \"When I take the 'alternative,'\" he was saying at every step, making all  his plans for the future depend on that.    He deferred until then a series of projects that would surprise his  mother, poor woman, overcome by the good fortune fallen suddenly upon  her house, and which, she thought, could not be surpassed.    The day of the \"alternative\" came at last, the day of Gallardo's  recognition as a killer of bulls. A celebrated _maestro_ ceded to him  his sword and _muleta_ in the open ring of Seville and the crowd went  mad with enthusiasm, seeing how he felled with a single sword-thrust the  first \"formal\" bull that appeared before him. The following month, this  tauromachic degree was bestowed again in the plaza of Madrid where  another _maestro_, not less celebrated, again gave him the \"alternative\"  in a _corrida_ of Miura bulls.    He was no longer a _novillero_; he was a _matador_, and his name figured  beside those of old swordsmen whom he had worshipped as unapproachable  gods when he was going about among the little towns taking part in the  bull-baitings. He remembered having lain in wait for one of them at a  station near Cordova to ask aid from him when he passed through on the  train with his _cuadrilla_. That night he had something to eat, thanks  to the generous fraternity that exists among the people of the queue  which impels a swordsman of princely luxury to hand out a _duro_ and a  cigar to the unfortunate little vagabond on the road to his first  _capeas_.    Contracts began to shower upon the new swordsman. In all the plazas of  the Peninsula they desired to see him, moved by curiosity. The  newspapers devoted to the profession popularized his picture and his  life, distorting the latter with novel episodes. No other _matador_ had  so many engagements. He was going to make money abundantly.    Antonio, his brother-in-law, told of this success with clouded brow and  loud protestations to his wife and her mother. The swordsman was an  ungrateful fellow--the history of all who rise suddenly. And he had  worked so hard for Juan! With what firmness had he argued with the  managers when the bullock-fight was arranged for him. And now that he  was a _maestro_ he had as a manager a gentleman he had met only a short  time ago; one Don Jose who was not one of the family but one for whom  Gallardo showed esteem on account of his prestige as an old connoisseur.    \"And he will be sorry for it,\" he ended, adding, \"A man has only one  family and where will he find such loving care as we have given"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33830"],[0,"Fur Farming (#13)"],[1," houses and those living in burrows in the banks of  streams are the same variety, their different, styles of habitation  being due to the different conditions of their respective locations.  Where streams are swift or where there is danger of the houses being  carried away by freshets, they dig burrows in the bank, making the  entrance below the surface of the water.    These burrows extend sometimes twenty-five or thirty feet into the bank  and the interior chamber is sometimes quite large. Along the streams of  the farming sections, much damage is done by muskrats because of these  burrows.    The houses of the marsh-dwellers are composed of grass and flags, grass  roots, mud, etc. They are of cone shaped structure and to those  unacquainted with the animals, they are simply piles of grass and weeds  in the water, for that is what they resemble. The entrances to these  houses are always deep under water. It is said that the muskrats build  their houses with thicker walls when they feel instinctively that an  unusually severe winter is approaching.    [Illustration: Muskrat House in a Marsh.]    In addition to the house the animals build small feeding places near by.  These feed beds as they are called, are constructed in the same way as  the houses, but only rise to the level of the water. These beds are the  dining rooms of the muskrats, for to them they bring all of their food  so that they may have a place to rest while they are enjoying their  meal. They also have like the raccoon, a habit of washing their food  before they will eat it.    The muskrat is a vegetarian and seldom eats any animal food. In the wild  state their natural food is grass and roots, fruit, grain and clams or  mussels. They are also fond of parsnips, carrots, artichokes, white flag  roots, wild rice, pond lily roots, sweet corn and pumpkin, and will eat  almost all kinds of vegetables.    It will be seen that in captivity the food problem would be easily  solved. They are very fond of wild rice, and those who have ponds  suitable for muskrats and are contemplating the raising of these animals  would do well to sow them with wild rice. The rice may be obtained from  almost any of the seed houses and it will grow in six or eight feet of  water. They are also fond of pumpkins and it is a cheap and satisfactory  food.    Some of them will lay up stores of food for winter, but they do not all  do this. Where the streams are rapid they can get out to hunt for food  at almost all times, and where they are located on lakes and marshes  that freeze over in winter they can find plenty of food in the water  under the ice. This food is taken to the feed bed to be eaten.    In early spring the warmth from their bodies will sometimes thaw a hole  through the ice over the bed and the muskrat stops this hole with grass  roots, etc. The trapper is looking for just such places and it is the  bunch of grass roots on the ice that gives them away. The steel trap is  soon in place, awaiting the coming of the animal, and many of them are  trapped in this way.    The breeding habits of the muskrat are different from those of other  fur-bearing animals, as they will have three litters in a season. The  first are born in April, and there will be from six to nine young. It is  claimed that the female of the first litter will also bear young that  season and this accounts for the small rats, or kits, caught during the  fall season.    It would appear from this that the animals should increase in numbers  very rapidly, but they have many enemies other than man, and perhaps  one-half of the muskrats born in a season never reach maturity. With the  exception of man, their greatest enemies are the birds of prey, such as  owls, hawks, buzzards, etc., but chiefly the owl, as it is a nocturnal  bird and has a fine opportunity to capture the unwary. The fox  frequently makes a capture, as does also the mink and otter.    It is a deplorable fact that there is a large proportion of small  animals in the trapper's catch. These are the young muskrats, for while  they grow rapidly the first summer, it requires several years for them  to attain full size, yet they class as No. 1 the first season. The old  animals are larger and their fur is more valuable than that of the  young. For those who raise the animals there would be less trouble from  catching young and immature rats.    Muskrats do not become fully prime until midwinter and many of them are  not strictly number one until March. When fully prime the skin will be  of a cream or pink color, with no dark spots showing. Winter caught  skins will have a number of dark spots, while those taken in the fall  have a very pronounced stripe or two on the back.    Along the Atlantic Coast for many years land owners have rented the rat  catching privileges to \"ratters\" on shares, which is generally one-half  of the catch. The \"ratters\" only trap when the fur is at its best, so  that the supply is holding out. On lands \"free for all\" the rats are  thinned out.    During recent years, property owners in various rat producing sections  have awakened to the fact that their \"swampy land\" is of more value for  the animal fur harvest than for any other purpose.    Muskrats are easily raised and increase rapidly. They often make their  homes in the banks of canals, fish ponds, etc., coming from nearby  waters of their own accord. These places seem to be ideal places for  muskrats and instead of their leaving they remain year after year, even  though they are trapped and the property owners resort to other means  endeavoring to get rid of them. Muskrats are not afraid of civilization,  and do well in thickly settled sections where there are rivers, creeks,  lakes, ponds, marshes, etc. They seem to do well in their natural state  where they have water and feed and on some ponds hundreds are caught  annually.    As already mentioned, these animals need little care. If the waters  where the animals are is naturally productive of muskrat food, the  animals will take care of themselves unless the numbers are too large  and they consume the entire food supply. The raisers should guard  against this by feeding, as the natural supply should be protected so as  to help furnish the food supply year after year.    Lakes, ponds, etc., that abound in wild rice, flags, lilies, etc., make  an ideal home for muskrats, as they are fond of both the wild rice seed  and roots, as well as the roots of flags and lilies, on which they feed  when the surface is frozen over. Artichokes should also be started, as  muskrats are fond of them.    Those who expect to raise this fur-bearer should take into consideration  that little or no fencing is required on lakes, ponds and creeks if  proper feed grows there. If the feed is not there the prospective raiser  should see that it is started at once by sowing wild rice seed,  transplanting some flags and lily roots to his muskrat waters. In fact,  the prospective muskrat raiser should have the food supply well under  way before the rats are brought or secured or they will destroy it.    There are no doubt hundreds of places that can be converted into ideal  \"muskrat preserves\" by a little work. Low, marshy land on which the  water is not deep enough to be dammed. Such a place would require a wire  fence around it. Perhaps the best way would be to place the fence  several rods back from the water, as there would then be no danger of  the animals burrowing under. The fence should be of five-foot wire, one  foot in the ground. Where the fence crosses any inlets or outlets, the  wire should be put much deeper for two rods or more on each side and it  would be well to place flat stones in the bottom of the trench, as shown  and described in the chapter on Enclosures.          CHAPTER X.    RACCOON RAISING.      The raccoon is closely allied to the bears, although much smaller. Like  them it possesses an omnivorous appetite, is plantigrade, and hibernates  during cold weather. It is found throughout the Southern, Central and  Eastern States, and in Southern Ontario and Nova Scotia. It is also  found in good numbers on the Pacific coast, northward into British  Columbia; but they are found in greatest numbers in the extreme South of  the United States, and especially in Florida, Louisiana and the lowlands  of Arkansas and Texas.    Their natural home is in the heavily timbered parts, but they are also  found in the sparsely wooded bottom lands of the Central States.    They den, as a rule, in hollow trees, well up from the ground, and  seldom if ever in a tree which has a continuous hollow and an opening at  the bottom, preferring a hollow, broken off limb, or a hole in the  trunk, high up on the tree. In some places they den in natural caves in  the rocks, and in the western part of their range, it is said that they  sometimes occupy dens in some high and dry bank of earth. During the  mating season the males travel considerably, and will, when daylight  approaches, seek a place of rest in any hollow tree that is to be found,  or failing to find this, may spend the day in a hollow log or under a  stump.    The mating season comes mainly, late in February or early in March, and  the young, from four to six in number, are born in April and the  beginning of May. They remain with the parents for some time during the  summer, but will find a den for themselves as soon as possible. However,  they will be found, the first season, in the near vicinity of the  parents' den.    The food of the coon is variable, to conform with conditions of  different sections, but wherever found, they feed on both vegetable and  animal food. Fish, frogs, crawfish, clams, eggs of birds, and turtles;  water snails, wild fruits, such as grapes and berries, nuts, acorns,  etc., are all eaten with a relish. They are especially fond of corn when  in the milky state, and in late summer they feed on it extensively. They  are fond of poultry, also of"]]]
