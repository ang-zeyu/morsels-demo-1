CAROLINE.    And the sea does not freeze, I suppose, because its depth is so great,  that a frost never lasts long enough to bring down the temperature of  such a great body of water to 40 degrees?    MRS. B.    That is one reason why the sea, as a large mass of water, does not  freeze. But, independently of this, salt water does not freeze till it  is cooled much below 32 degrees, and with respect to the law of  condensation, salt water is an exception, as it condenses even many  degrees below the freezing point. When the caloric of fresh water,  therefore, is imprisoned by the ice on its surface, the ocean still  continues throwing off heat into the atmosphere, which is a most signal  dispensation of Providence to moderate the intensity of the cold in  winter.    CAROLINE.    This theory of the non-conducting power of liquids, does not, I suppose,  hold good with respect to air, otherwise the atmosphere would not be  heated by the rays of the sun passing through it?    MRS. B.    Nor is it heated in that way. The pure atmosphere is a perfectly  transparent medium, which neither radiates, absorbs, nor conducts  caloric, but transmits the rays of the sun to us without in any way  diminishing their intensity. The air is therefore not more heated, by  the sun's rays passing through it, than diamond, glass, water, or any  other transparent medium.    CAROLINE.    That is very extraordinary! Are glass windows not heated then by the sun  shining on them?    MRS. B.    No; not if the glass be perfectly transparent. A most convincing proof  that glass transmits the rays of the sun without being heated by them is  afforded by the burning lens, which by converging the rays to a focus  will set combustible bodies on fire, without its own temperature being  raised.    EMILY.    Yet, Mrs. B., if I hold a piece of glass near the fire it is almost  immediately warmed by it; the glass therefore must retain some of the  caloric radiated by the fire? Is it that the solar rays alone pass  freely through glass without paying tribute? It seems unaccountable that  the radiation of a common fire should have power to do what the sun's  rays cannot accomplish.    MRS. B.    It is not because the rays from the fire have more power, but rather  because they have less, that they heat glass and other transparent  bodies. It is true, however, that as you approach the source of heat the  rays being nearer each other, the heat is more condensed, and can  produce effects of which the solar rays, from the great distance of  their source, are incapable. Thus we should find it impossible to roast  a joint of meat by the sun's rays, though it is so easily done by  culinary heat. Yet caloric emanated from burning bodies, which is  commonly called _culinary heat_, has neither the intensity nor the  velocity of solar rays. All caloric, we have said, is supposed to  proceed originally from the sun; but after having been incorporated with  terrestrial bodies, and again given out by them, though its nature is  not essentially altered, it retains neither the intensity nor the  velocity with which it first emanated from that luminary; it has  therefore not the power of passing through transparent mediums, such as  glass and water, without being partially retained by those bodies.    EMILY.    I recollect that in the experiment on the reflection of heat, the glass  skreen which you interposed between the burning taper and the mirror,  arrested the rays of caloric, and suffered only those of light to pass  through it.    CAROLINE.    Glass windows, then, though they cannot be heated by the sun shining on  them, may be heated internally by a fire in the room? But, Mrs. B.,  since the atmosphere is not warmed by the solar rays passing through it,  how does it obtain heat; for all the fires that are burning on the  surface of the earth would contribute very little towards warming it?    EMILY.    The radiation of heat is not confined to burning bodies: for all bodies,  you know, have that property; therefore, not only every thing upon the  surface of the earth, but the earth itself, must radiate heat; and this  terrestrial caloric, not having, I suppose, sufficient power to traverse  the atmosphere, communicates heat to it.    MRS. B.    Your inference is extremely well drawn, Emily; but the foundation on  which it rests is not sound; for the fact is, that terrestrial or  culinary heat, though it cannot pass through the denser transparent  mediums, such as glass or water, without loss, traverses the atmosphere  completely: so that all the heat which the earth radiates, unless it  meet with clouds or any foreign body to intercept its passage, passes  into the distant regions of the universe.    CAROLINE.    What a pity that so much heat should be wasted!    MRS. B.    Before you are tempted to object to any law of nature, reflect whether  it may not prove to be one of the numberless dispensations of Providence  for our good. If all the heat which the earth has received from the sun,  since the creation had been accumulated in it, its temperature by this  time would, no doubt, have been more elevated than any human being could  have borne.    CAROLINE.    I spoke indeed very inconsiderately. But, Mrs. B., though the earth, at  such a high temperature, might have scorched our feet, we should always  have had a cool refreshing air to breathe, since the radiation of the  earth does not heat the atmosphere.    EMILY.    The cool air would have afforded but very insufficient refreshment,  whilst our bodies were exposed to the burning radiation of the earth.    MRS. B.    Nor should we have breathed a cool air; for though it is true that heat  is not communicated to the atmosphere by radiation, yet the air is  warmed by contact with heated bodies, in the same manner as solids or  liquids. The stratum of air which is immediately in contact with the  earth is heated by it; it becomes specifically lighter and rises, making  way for another stratum of air which is in its turn heated and carried  upwards; and thus each successive stratum of air is warmed by coming in  contact with the earth. You may perceive this effect in a sultry day, if  you attentively observe the strata of air near the surface of the earth;  they appear in constant agitation, for though it is true the air is  itself invisible, yet the sun shining on the vapours floating in it,  render them visible, like the amber dust in the water. The temperature  of the surface of the earth is therefore the source from whence the  atmosphere derives its heat, though it is communicated neither by  radiation, nor transmitted from one particle of it to another by the  conducting power; but every particle of air must come in contact with  the earth in order to receive heat from it.    EMILY.    Wind then by agitating the air should contribute to cool the earth and  warm the atmosphere, by bringing a more rapid succession of fresh strata  of air in contact with the earth, and yet in general wind feels cooler  than still air?    MRS. B.    Because the agitation of the air carries off heat from the surface of  our bodies more rapidly than still air, by occasioning a greater number  of points of contact in a given time.    EMILY.    Since it is from the earth and not the sun that the atmosphere receives  its heat, I no longer wonder that elevated regions should be colder than  plains and valleys; it was always a subject of astonishment to me, that  in ascending a mountain and approaching the sun, the air became colder  instead of being more heated.    MRS. B.    At the distance of about a hundred million of miles, which we are from  the sun, the approach of a few thousand feet makes no sensible  difference, whilst it produces a very considerable effect with regard to  the warming the atmosphere at the surface of the earth.    CAROLINE.    Yet as the warm air rises from the earth and the cold air descends to  it, I should have supposed that heat would have accumulated in the upper  regions of the atmosphere, and that we should have felt the air warmer  as we ascended?    MRS. B.    The atmosphere, you know, diminishes in density, and consequently in  weight, as it is more distant from the earth; the warm air, therefore,  rises only till it meets with a stratum of air of its own density; and  it will not ascend into the upper regions of the atmosphere until all  the parts beneath have been previously heated. The length of summer even  in warm climates does not heat the air sufficiently to melt the snow  which has accumulated during the winter on very high mountains, although  they are almost constantly exposed to the heat of the sun's rays, being  too much elevated to be often enveloped in clouds.    EMILY.    These explanations are very satisfactory; but allow me to ask you one  more question respecting the increased levity of heated liquids. You  said that when water was heated over the fire, the particles at the  bottom of the vessel ascended as soon as heated, in consequence of their  specific levity: why does not the same effect continue when the water  boils, and is converted into steam? and why does the steam rise from the  surface, instead of the bottom of the liquid?    MRS. B.    The steam or vapour does ascend from the bottom, though it seems to  arise from the surface of the liquid. We shall boil some water in this  Florence flask, (PLATE IV. Fig. 1.) in order that you may be well  acquainted with the process of ebullition;--you will then see, through  the glass, that the vapour rises in bubbles from the bottom. We shall  make it boil by means of a lamp, which is more convenient for this  purpose than the chimney fire.      [Illustration: Plate IV. Vol. I. p. 84.      Fig. 1. Pneumatic Pump.

Though I am not fond of assaying to give such wounds, yet, the proof  [_of_] such, when given, carries with it what is very palpable.\"    This alludes to a particular form of spectral evidence. One of the  \"afflicted children\" would testify that she saw and felt the spectre of  the accused, tormenting her, and struck at it. A corresponding wound or  bruise was found on the body, or a rent in the garments, of the accused.  Mather commended this species of evidence, writing to one of the Judges,  on the eve of the trials. He not only commends, but urges it as  conclusive of guilt. Referring to what constituted the bulk of the  evidence of the accusing girls, and which was wholly spectral in its  nature--namely, that they were \"hurt\" by an \"unseen hand\"--he charges  Richards, if he finds such \"hurt\" to be inflicted by the persons  accused, \"Hold them, for you have catched a witch.\" He recommends  putting the Prisoners upon repeating the \"Lord's prayer\" or certain  \"other Systems of Christianity.\" He endorses the evidence derived from  \"poppits,\" \"witch-marks,\" and even the \"water ordeal.\" He advised a  Judge, just proceeding to sit in cases of life and death, to make use of  \"cross and swift questions,\" as the means of bringing the accused \"into  confusion, likely to lead them into confession.\"    Whoever examines, carefully, this letter to Richards, cannot, I think,  but conclude that, instead of exonerating Mather, it fixes upon him the  responsibility for the worst features of the Witchcraft Trials.    The next document on which the Reviewer relies is the _Return of the  Ministers consulted by his Excellency and the honorable Council, upon  the present Witchcraft in Salem Village_. It is necessary to give it  entire, as follows:        [\"I. The afflicted state of our poor neighbours, that are now      suffering by molestations from the invisible world, we apprehend so      deplorable, that we think their condition calls for the utmost help      of all persons in their several capacities.        \"II. We cannot but, with all thankfulness, acknowledge the success      which the merciful God has given to the sedulous and assiduous      endeavours of our honorable rulers, to defeat the abominable      witchcrafts which have been committed in the country, humbly      praying, that the discovery of those mysterious and mischievous      wickednesses may be perfected.]        \"III. We judge that, in the prosecution of these and all such      witchcrafts, there is need of a very critical and exquisite caution,      lest by too much credulity for things received only upon the Devil's      authority, there be a door opened for a long train of miserable      consequences, and Satan get an advantage over us; for we should not      be ignorant of his devices.        \"IV. As in complaints upon witchcrafts there may be matters of      enquiry which do not amount unto matters of presumption, and there      may be matters of presumption which yet may not be reckoned matters      of conviction, so it is necessary, that all proceedings thereabout      be managed with an exceeding tenderness towards those that may be      complained of, especially if they have been persons formerly of an      unblemished reputation.        \"V. When the first inquiry is made into the circumstances of such as      may lie under any just suspicion of witchcrafts, we could wish that      there may be admitted as little as possible of such noise, company,      and openness, as may too hastily expose them that are examined; and      that there may nothing be used as a test for the trial of the      suspected, the lawfulness whereof may be doubted among the people of      God; but that the directions given by such judicious writers as      Perkins and Bernard may be consulted in such a case.        \"VI. Presumptions whereupon persons may be committed, and, much      more, convictions whereupon persons may be condemned as guilty of      witchcrafts, ought certainly to be more considerable than barely the      accused persons being represented by a spectre unto the afflicted;      [inasmuch as it is an undoubted and a notorious thing, that a Demon      may, by God's permission, appear, even to ill purposes, in the shape      of an innocent, yea, and a virtuous man.] Nor can we esteem      alterations made in the sufferers, by a look or touch of the      accused, to be an infallible evidence of guilt, but frequently      liable to be abused by the Devil's legerdemain.        \"VII. We know not whether some remarkable affront, given the Devil,      by our disbelieving of those testimonies, whose whole force and      strength is from him alone, may not put a period unto the progress      of the dreadful calamity begun upon us, in the accusation of so many      persons, whereof some, we hope, are yet clear from the great      transgression laid to their charge.        [\"VIII. Nevertheless, we cannot but humbly recommend unto the      Government, the speedy and vigorous prosecutions of such as have      rendered themselves obnoxious, according to the directions given in      the laws of God, and the wholesome Statutes of the English nation,      for the detection of Witchcrafts.\"]    I have enclosed the _first_, _second_ and _eighth_ Sections, and a part  of the _sixth_, in brackets, for purposes that will appear, in a  subsequent part of this discussion. The _Advice of the Ministers_ was  written by Cotton Mather. As in his letter to Richards, he does not  caution _against_ the use, but _in_ the use, of spectral evidence. Not a  word is said denouncing its introduction or advising its entire  rejection. We look in vain for a line or a syllable disapproving the  trial and execution just had, resting as they did, entirely upon  spectral evidence: on the contrary, the _second_ Section applauds what  had been done; and prays that the work entered upon may be perfected.  The first clauses in the _fourth_ Section sanction its admission, as  affording ground of \"presumption,\" although \"it may not be matter of  conviction.\" The _sixth_ Section, while it appears to convey the idea  that spectral evidence alone ought not to be regarded as sufficient,  contains, at the same time, a form of expression, that not only requires  its reception, but places its claims on the highest possible grounds.  \"_A Demon may, by GOD'S PERMISSION, appear, even to ill purposes, in the  shape of an innocent, yea, and a virtuous man._\" It is sufficiently  shocking to think that anything, _to ill purposes_, can be done by  Divine permission; but horrible, indeed, to intimate that the Devil can  have that permission to malign and murder an innocent person. If the  spectre appears by God's permission, the effect produced has his  sanction. The blasphemous supposition that God permits the Devil thus to  bear false witness, to the destruction of the righteous, overturns all  the sentiments and instincts of our moral and religious nature. In using  this language, the Ministers did not have a rational apprehension of  what they were saying, which is the only apology for much of the  theological phraseology of that day. This phrase, \"God's permission,\"  had quite a currency at the time; and if it did not reconcile the mind,  subdued it to wondering and reverent silence. It will be seen that  Mather, on other occasions, repeated this idea, in various and sometimes  stronger terms. The _third_, _fifth_, _seventh_, and last clauses of the  _fourth_ Sections, contain phrases which will become intelligible, as we  advance in the examination of Mather's writings, relating to the subject  of witchcraft.    Here it may, again, be safely said, that if Increase and Cotton Mather  had really, as the Reviewer affirms, been opposed to the _admission_ of  spectral testimony, this was the time for them to have said so. If, at  this crisis, they had \"denounced it, as illegal, uncharitable and  cruel,\" no more blood would have been shed. If the _Advice_ had even  recommended, in the most moderate terms, its absolute exclusion from  every stage of the proceedings, they would have come to an end. But it  assumes its introduction, and only suggests \"disbelief\" of it, in  avoiding to act upon it, in \"some\" instances.    Hutchinson states the conclusion of the matter, after quoting the whole  document. \"The Judges seem to have paid more regard to the last article  of this _Return_, than to several which precede it; for the prosecutions  were carried on with all possible vigor, and without that exquisite  caution which is proposed.\"--_History_, ii., 54.    The _Advice_ was skilfully--it is not uncharitable to say--artfully  drawn up. It has deceived the Reviewer into his statement that it was  \"very specific in excluding spectral testimony.\" A careless reader, or  one whose eyes are blinded by a partisan purpose, may not see its real  import. The paper is so worded as to mislead persons not conversant with  the ideas and phraseology of that period. But it was considered by all  the Judges, and the people in general, fully to endorse the proceedings  in the trial of Bridget Bishop, and to advise their speedy and vigorous  continuance. It was spectral testimony that overwhelmed her. It was the  fatal element that wrought the conviction of every person put on trial,  from first to last; as was fully proved, five months afterwards, when  Sir William Phips, under circumstances I shall describe, bravely and  peremptorily forbid, as the Ministers failed to do, the \"trying,\" or  even \"committing,\" of any one, on the evidence of \"the afflicted  persons,\" which was wholly spectral. When thus, by his orders, it was  utterly thrown out, the life of the prosecutions became, at once,  extinct; and, as Mather says, the accused were cleared as fast as they  were tried.--_Magnalia_, Book II., page 64.
