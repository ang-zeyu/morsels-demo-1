Perhaps a few people, or at least my friends, will remember that I made my  first plunge into life armed with some errors and some exaggerations, but  that, in any case, I began with _hope_ in my heart. In the philosophical  pessimism of the nineteenth century, I recognised--who knows by what  by-paths of personal experience--the symptom of a higher power of thought,  a more triumphant plenitude of life, than had manifested itself hitherto  in the philosophies of Hume, Kant and Hegel!--I regarded _tragic_ knowledge  as the most beautiful luxury of our culture, as its most precious, most  noble, most dangerous kind of prodigality; but, nevertheless, in view of  its overflowing wealth, as a justifiable _luxury_. In the same way, I  began by interpreting Wagner's music as the expression of a Dionysian  powerfulness of soul. In it I thought I heard the earthquake by means of  which a primeval life-force, which had been constrained for ages, was  seeking at last to burst its bonds, quite indifferent to how much of that  which nowadays calls itself culture, would thereby be shaken to ruins. You  see how I misinterpreted, you see also, what I _bestowed_ upon Wagner and  Schopenhauer--myself.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Every art and every philosophy may be regarded  either as a cure or as a stimulant to ascending or declining life: they  always presuppose suffering and sufferers. But there are two kinds of  sufferers:--those that suffer from _overflowing vitality_, who need  Dionysian art and require a tragic insight into, and a tragic outlook  upon, the phenomenon life,--and there are those who suffer from _reduced_  vitality, and who crave for repose, quietness, calm seas, or else the  intoxication, the spasm, the bewilderment which art and philosophy  provide. Revenge upon life itself--this is the most voluptuous form of  intoxication for such indigent souls!{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} Now Wagner responds quite as well  as Schopenhauer to the twofold cravings of these people,--they both deny  life, they both slander it but precisely on this account they are my  antipodes.--The richest creature, brimming over with vitality,--the  Dionysian God and man, may not only allow himself to gaze upon the  horrible and the questionable; but he can also lend his hand to the  terrible deed, and can indulge in all the luxury of destruction,  disaggregation, and negation,--in him evil, purposelessness and ugliness,  seem just as allowable as they are in nature--because of his bursting  plenitude of creative and rejuvenating powers, which are able to convert  every desert into a luxurious land of plenty. Conversely, it is the  greatest sufferer and pauper in vitality, who is most in need of mildness,  peace and goodness--that which to-day is called humaneness--in thought as  well as in action, and possibly of a God whose speciality is to be a God  of the sick, a Saviour, and also of logic or the abstract intelligibility  of existence even for idiots (--the typical \"free-spirits,\" like the  idealists, and \"beautiful souls,\" are _decadents_--); in short, of a warm,  danger-tight, and narrow confinement, between optimistic horizons which  would allow of stultification.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} And thus very gradually, I began to  understand Epicurus, the opposite of a Dionysian Greek, and also the  Christian who in fact is only a kind of Epicurean, and who, with his  belief that \"faith saves,\" carries the principle of Hedonism _as far as  possible_--far beyond all intellectual honesty.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} If I am ahead of all other  psychologists in anything, it is in this fact that my eyes are more keen  for tracing those most difficult and most captious of all deductions, in  which the largest number of mistakes have been made,--the deduction which  makes one infer something concerning the author from his work, something  concerning the doer from his deed, something concerning the idealist from  the need which produced this ideal, and something concerning the imperious  _craving_ which stands at the back of all thinking and valuing--In regard  to all artists of what kind soever, I shall now avail myself of this  radical distinction: does the creative power in this case arise from a  loathing of life, or from an excessive _plenitude_ of life? In Goethe, for  instance, an overflow of vitality was creative, in Flaubert--hate:  Flaubert, a new edition of Pascal, but as an artist with this instinctive  belief at heart: \"_Flaubert est toujours haissable, l'homme n'est rien,  l'oeuvre est tout_\".{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} He tortured himself when he wrote, just as Pascal  tortured himself when he thought--the feelings of both were inclined to be  \"non-egoistic.\" {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} \"Disinterestedness\"--principle of decadence, the will to  nonentity in art as well as in morality.        Where Wagner Is At Home.      Even at the present day, France is still the refuge of the most  intellectual and refined culture in Europe, it remains the high school of  taste: but one must know where to find this France of taste. The  _North-German Gazette_, for instance, or whoever expresses his sentiments  in that paper, thinks that the French are \"barbarians,\"--as for me, if I  had to find the _blackest_ spot on earth, where slaves still required to  be liberated, I should turn in the direction of Northern Germany.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} But  those who form part of _that select_ France take very good care to  _conceal themselves_; they are a small body of men, and there may be some  among them who do not stand on very firm legs--a few may be fatalists,  hypochondriacs, invalids; others may be enervated, and artificial,--such  are those who would fain be artistic,--but all the loftiness and delicacy  which still remains to this world, is in their possession. In this France  of intellect, which is also the France of pessimism, Schopenhauer is  already much more at home than he ever was in Germany, his principal work  has already been translated twice, and the second time so excellently that  now I prefer to read Schopenhauer in French (--he was an _accident_ among  Germans, just as I am--the Germans have no fingers wherewith to grasp us;  they haven't any fingers at all,--but only claws). And I do not mention  Heine--_l'adorable Heine_, as they say in Paris--who long since has passed  into the flesh and blood of the more profound and more soulful of French  lyricists. How could the horned cattle of Germany know how to deal with  the _delicatesses_ of such a nature!--And as to Richard Wagner, it is  obvious, it is even glaringly obvious, that Paris is the very _soil_ for  him, the more French music adapts itself to the needs of _l'ame moderne_,  the more Wagnerian it will become,--it is far enough advanced in this  direction already.--In this respect one should not allow one's self to be  misled by Wagner himself--it was simply disgraceful on Wagner's part to  scoff at Paris, as he did, in its agony in 1871.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} In spite of it all, in  Germany Wagner is only a misapprehension.--who could be more incapable of  understanding anything about Wagner than the Kaiser, for instance?--To  everybody familiar with the movement of European culture, this fact,  however, is certain, that French romanticism and Richard Wagner are most  intimately related. All dominated by literature, up to their very eyes and  ears--the first European artists with a _universal literary_ culture,--most  of them writers, poets, mediators and minglers of the senses and the arts,  all fanatics in _expression_, great discoverers in the realm of the  sublime as also of the ugly and the gruesome, and still greater  discoverers in passion, in working for effect, in the art of dressing  their windows,--all possessing talent far above their genius,--virtuosos to  their backbone, knowing of secret passages to all that seduces, lures,  constrains or overthrows; born enemies of logic and of straight lines,  thirsting after the exotic, the strange and the monstrous, and all opiates  for the senses and the understanding. On the whole, a daring dare-devil,  magnificently violent, soaring and high-springing crew of artists, who  first had to teach their own century--it is the century of the mob--what the  concept \"artist\" meant. But they were _ill_.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~}        Wagner As The Apostle Of Chastity.      1.      Is this the German way?  Comes this low bleating forth from German hearts?  Should Teutons, sin repenting, lash themselves,  Or spread their palms with priestly unctuousness,  Exalt their feelings with the censer's fumes,  And cower and quake and bend the trembling knee,  And with a sickly sweetness plead a prayer?  Then ogle nuns, and ring the Ave-bell,  And thus with morbid fervour out-do heaven?  Is this the German way?  Beware, yet are you free, yet your own Lords.  What yonder lures is Rome, Rome's faith sung without words.      2.      There is no necessary contrast between sensuality and chastity, every good  marriage, every genuine love affair is above this contrast; but in those  cases where the contrast exists, it is very far from being necessarily a  tragic one. This, at least, ought to hold good of all well-constituted and  good-spirited mortals, who are not in the least inclined to reckon their  unstable equilibrium between angel and _petite bete_, without further ado,  among the objections to existence, the more refined and more intelligent  like Hafis and Goethe, even regarded it as an additional attraction. It is  precisely contradictions of this kind which lure us to life.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} On the other  hand, it must be obvious, that when Circe's unfortunate animals are  induced to worship chastity, all they see and _worship_ therein, is their  opposite--oh! and with what tragic groaning and fervour, may well be  imagined--that same painful and thoroughly superfluous opposition which,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25016"],[0,"The House of Souls (#13)"],[1,"Mrs. Darnell. 'It _is_ very strange,  isn't it?'    'Strange!' Darnell ruminated for a while.    'I know what I think, Mary,' he said at length. 'I don't believe a word  of it. I believe your aunt is going mad, or has gone mad, and that she  has delusions. The whole thing sounds to me like the invention of a  lunatic.'    'You are quite wrong. Every word is true, and if you will let me go on,  you will understand how it all happened.'    'Very good, go ahead.'    'Let me see, where was I? Oh, I know, aunt saw the boy grinning in the  hedge. Yes, well, she was dreadfully frightened for a minute or two;  there was something so queer about the face, but then she plucked up a  spirit and said to herself, \"After all, better a boy with red hair than  a big man with a gun,\" and she made up her mind to watch Uncle Robert  closely, as she could see by his look he knew all about it; he seemed as  if he were thinking hard and puzzling over something, as if he didn't  know what to do next, and his mouth kept opening and shutting, like a  fish's. So she kept her face straight, and didn't say a word, and when  he said something to her about the fine sunset, she took no notice.  \"Don't you hear what I say, Marian?\" he said, speaking quite crossly,  and bellowing as if it were to somebody in the next field. So aunt said  she was very sorry, but her cold made her so deaf, she couldn't hear  much. She noticed uncle looked quite pleased, and relieved too, and she  knew he thought she hadn't heard the whistling. Suddenly uncle pretended  to see a beautiful spray of honeysuckle high up in the hedge, and he  said he must get it for aunt, only she must go on ahead, as it made him  nervous to be watched. She said she would, but she just stepped aside  behind a bush where there was a sort of cover in the hedge, and found  she could see him quite well, though she scratched her face terribly  with poking it into a rose bush. And in a minute or two out came the boy  from behind the hedge, and she saw uncle and him talking, and she knew  it was the same boy, as it wasn't dark enough to hide his flaming red  head. And uncle put out his hand as if to catch him, but he just darted  into the bushes and vanished. Aunt never said a word at the time, but  that night when they got home she charged uncle with what she'd seen and  asked him what it all meant. He was quite taken aback at first, and  stammered and stuttered and said a spy wasn't his notion of a good wife,  but at last he made her swear secrecy, and told her that he was a very  high Freemason, and that the boy was an emissary of the order who  brought him messages of the greatest importance. But aunt didn't believe  a word of it, as an uncle of hers was a mason, and he never behaved like  that. It was then she began to be afraid that it was really Anarchists,  or something of the kind, and every time the bell rang she thought that  uncle had been found out, and the police had come for him.'    'What nonsense! As if a man with house property would be an Anarchist.'    'Well, she could see there must be some horrible secret, and she didn't  know what else to think. And then she began to have the things through  the post.'    'Things through the post! What do you mean by that?'    'All sorts of things; bits of broken bottle-glass, packed carefully as  if it were jewellery; parcels that unrolled and unrolled worse than  Chinese boxes, and then had \"cat\" in large letters when you came to the  middle; old artificial teeth, a cake of red paint, and at last  cockroaches.'    'Cockroaches by post! Stuff and nonsense; your aunt's mad.'    'Edward, she showed me the box; it was made to hold cigarettes, and  there were three dead cockroaches inside. And when she found a box of  exactly the same kind, half-full of cigarettes, in uncle's great-coat  pocket, then her head began to turn again.'    Darnell groaned, and stirred uneasily in his chair, feeling that the  tale of Aunt Marian's domestic troubles was putting on the semblance of  an evil dream.    'Anything else?' he asked.    'My dear, I haven't repeated half the things poor aunt told me this  afternoon. There was the night she thought she saw a ghost in the  shrubbery. She was anxious about some chickens that were just due to  hatch out, so she went out after dark with some egg and bread-crumbs, in  case they might be out. And just before her she saw a figure gliding by  the rhododendrons. It looked like a short, slim man dressed as they  used to be hundreds of years ago; she saw the sword by his side, and  the feather in his cap. She thought she should have died, she said, and  though it was gone in a minute, and she tried to make out it was all her  fancy, she fainted when she got into the house. Uncle was at home that  night, and when she came to and told him he ran out, and stayed out for  half-an-hour or more, and then came in and said he could find nothing;  and the next minute aunt heard that low whistle just outside the window,  and uncle ran out again.'    'My dear Mary, do let us come to the point. What on earth does it all  lead to?'    'Haven't you guessed? Why, of course it was that girl all the time.'    'Girl? I thought you said it was a boy with a red head?'    'Don't you see? She's an actress, and she dressed up. She won't leave  uncle alone. It wasn't enough that he was with her nearly every evening  in the week, but she must be after him on Sundays too. Aunt found a  letter the horrid thing had written, and so it has all come out. Enid  Vivian she calls herself, though I don't suppose she has any right to  one name or the other. And the question is, what is to be done?'    'Let us talk of that again. I'll have a pipe, and then we'll go to bed.'    They were almost asleep when Mary said suddenly--    'Doesn't it seem queer, Edward? Last night you were telling me such  beautiful things, and to-night I have been talking about that  disgraceful old man and his goings on.'    'I don't know,' answered Darnell, dreamily. 'On the walls of that great  church upon the hill I saw all kinds of strange grinning monsters,  carved in stone.'    The misdemeanours of Mr. Robert Nixon brought in their train  consequences strange beyond imagination. It was not that they continued  to develop on the somewhat fantastic lines of these first adventures  which Mrs. Darnell had related; indeed, when 'Aunt Marian' came over to  Shepherd's Bush, one Sunday afternoon, Darnell wondered how he had had  the heart to laugh at the misfortunes of a broken-hearted woman.    He had never seen his wife's aunt before, and he was strangely surprised  when Alice showed her into the garden where they were sitting on the  warm and misty Sunday in September. To him, save during these latter  days, she had always been associated with ideas of splendour and  success: his wife had always mentioned the Nixons with a tinge of  reverence; he had heard, many times, the epic of Mr. Nixon's struggles  and of his slow but triumphant rise. Mary had told the story as she had  received it from her parents, beginning with the flight to London from  some small, dull, and unprosperous town in the flattest of the Midlands,  long ago, when a young man from the country had great chances of  fortune. Robert Nixon's father had been a grocer in the High Street, and  in after days the successful coal merchant and builder loved to tell of  that dull provincial life, and while he glorified his own victories, he  gave his hearers to understand that he came of a race which had also  known how to achieve. That had been long ago, he would explain: in the  days when that rare citizen who desired to go to London or to York was  forced to rise in the dead of night, and make his way, somehow or other,  by ten miles of quagmirish, wandering lanes to the Great North Road,  there to meet the 'Lightning' coach, a vehicle which stood to all the  countryside as the visible and tangible embodiment of tremendous  speed--'and indeed,' as Nixon would add, 'it was always up to time,  which is more than can be said of the Dunham Branch Line nowadays!' It  was in this ancient Dunham that the Nixons had waged successful trade  for perhaps a hundred years, in a shop with bulging bay windows looking  on the market-place. There was no competition, and the townsfolk, and  well-to-do farmers, the clergy and the country families, looked upon the  house of Nixon as an institution fixed as the town hall (which stood on  Roman pillars) and the parish church. But the change came: the railway  crept nearer and nearer, the farmers and the country gentry became less  well-to-do; the tanning, which was the local industry, suffered from a  great business which had been established in a larger town, some twenty  miles away, and the profits of the Nixons grew less and less. Hence the  hegira of Robert, and he would dilate on the poorness of his beginnings,  how he saved, by little and little, from his sorry wage of City clerk,  and how he and a fellow clerk, 'who had come into a hundred pounds,' saw  an opening in the coal trade--and filled it. It was at this stage of  Robert's fortunes, still far from magnificent, that Miss Marian Reynolds  had encountered him, she being on a visit to friends in Gunnersbury.  Afterwards, victory followed victory; Nixon's wharf became a landmark to  bargemen; his power stretched abroad, his dusky fleets went outwards to  the sea, and inward by all the far reaches of canals. Lime, cement, and  bricks were added to his merchandise, and at last he hit upon the great  stroke--that extensive taking up of land in the north of London. Nixon  himself ascribed this _coup_ to native sagacity, and the possession of  capital; and there were also obscure rumours to the effect that some one  or other had been 'done' in the course of the transaction. However that  might be, the Nixons grew wealthy to excess, and Mary had often told her  husband of the state in which they dwelt, of their liveried"]]]
