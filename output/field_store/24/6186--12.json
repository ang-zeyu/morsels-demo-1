I have seen several that have been marked in a very singular way. One  was entirely white, with black ears. Another white, with a black tail  only. This had orange eyes, and was very pretty. Another had a black  blaze up the nose, the rest of the animal being white. This had blue  eyes, and was deaf. Another had the two front feet black, all else being  white; the eyes were yellow-tinted green. All these, it will be  observed, were perfect in the way they were marked.    I give an illustration of a cat belonging to Mr. S. Lyon, of Crewe. It  is remarkable in more ways than one, and in all probability, had it been  born in \"the dark ages\" a vast degree of importance would have been  attached to it, not only on account of the peculiar distribution of the  colour and its form, but also as to the singular coincidence of its  birth. The head is white, with a black mark over the eyes and ears  which, when looked at from above, presents the appearance of a  _fleur-de-lis_. The body is white, with a distinct black cross on the  right side, or, rather, more on the back than side. The cross resembles  that known as Maltese in form, and is clearly defined. The tail is  black, the legs and feet white. Nor does the cat's claim to notice  entirely end here, for, marvellous to relate, it was born on Easter  Sunday, A.D. 1886. Now, what would have been said of such a coincidence  had this peculiar development of Nature occurred in bygone times? There  is just the possibility that the credulous would have \"flocked\" to see  the wondrous animal from far and near; and even now, in these  enlightened times, I learn from Mr. Lyon that the cat is not by any  means devoid of interest and attraction, for, as he tells me, a number  of persons have been to see it, some of whom predict that \"luck\" will  follow, and that he and his household will, in consequence, _doubtless_  enjoy many blessings, and that all things will prosper with him  accordingly.    Although my remarks are directed to \"the white-and-black\" cat, the same  will apply to the \"white-and-red, white-and-yellow, white-and-tabby,  white-and-blue, or dun colour;\" all these, and the foregoing, will most  probably have to be exhibited in the \"Any Other Colour\" class, as there  is seldom one at even the largest shows for peculiar markings with white  as the _ground_ or principal colour.    [Illustration: WHITE CAT.]      [Illustration]          SIAMESE CAT.      Among the beautiful varieties of the domestic cat brought into notice by  the cat shows, none deserve more attention than \"The Royal Cat of Siam.\"  In form, colour, texture, and length, or rather shortness of its coat,  it is widely different from other short-haired varieties; yet there is  but little difference in its mode of life or habit. I have not had the  pleasure of owning one of this breed, though when on a visit to Lady  Dorothy Nevill, at Dangstein, near Petersfield, I had several  opportunities for observation. I noticed in particular the intense  liking of these cats for \"the woods,\" not passing along the hedgerows  like the ordinary cat, but quickly and quietly creeping from bush to  bush, then away in the shaws; not that they displayed a wildness of  nature, in being shy or distrustful, nor did they seem to care about  getting wet like many cats do, though apparently they suffer much when  it is cold and damp weather, as would be likely on account of the  extreme shortness of their fur, which is of both a hairy and a woolly  texture, and not so glossy as our ordinary common domestic cat, nor is  the tail, which is thin. Lady Dorothy Nevill informed me that those  which belonged to her were imported from Siam and presented by Sir R.  Herbert of the Colonial Office; the late Duke of Wellington imported the  breed, also Mr. Scott of Rotherfield. Lady Dorothy Nevill thought them  exceedingly docile and domestic, but delicate in their constitution;  although her ladyship kept one for two years, another over a year, but  eventually all died of the same complaint, that of worms, which  permeated every part of their body.    Mr. Young, of Harrogate, possesses a chocolate variety of this Royal  Siamese cat; it was sent from Singapore to Mr. Brennand, from whom he  purchased it, and is described as \"most loving and affectionate,\" which  I believe is usually the case. Although this peculiar colour is very  beautiful and scarce, I am of opinion that the light gray or fawn colour  with black and well-marked muzzle, ears, and legs is the typical  variety, the markings being the same as the Himalayan rabbits. There are  cavies so marked; and many years ago I saw a mouse similarly coloured.  Mr. Young informs me that the kittens he has bred from his dark variety  have invariably come the usual gray or light dun colour with dark  points. I therefore take that to be the correct form and colour, and the  darker colour to be an accidental deviation. In pug-dogs such a depth of  colour would be considered a blemish, however beautiful it might be;  even black pugs do not obtain prizes in competition with a true-marked  light dun; but whatever colour the body is it should be clear and firm,  rich and not clouded in any way. But I give Mr. Young's own views:    \"The dun Siamese we have has won whenever shown; the body is of a dun  colour, nose, part of the face, ears, feet, and tail of a very dark  chocolate brown, nearly black, eyes of a beautiful blue by day, and of a  red colour at night! My other prize cat is of a very rich chocolate or  seal, with darker face, ears, and tail; the legs are a shade darker,  which intensifies towards the feet. The eyes small, of a rich amber  colour, the ears are bare of hair, and not so much hair between the eyes  and the ears as the English cats have. The dun, unless under special  judges, invariably beats the chocolate at the shows. The tail is shorter  and finer than our English cats.    \"I may add that we lately have had four kittens from the chocolate cat  by a pure dun Siamese he-cat. All the young are dun coloured, and when  born were very light, nearly white, but are gradually getting the dark  points of the parents; in fact, I expect that one will turn chocolate.  The cats are very affectionate, and make charming ladies' pets, but are  rather more delicate than our cats, but after they have once wintered in  England they seem to get acclimatised.    \"Mr. Brennand, who brought the chocolate one and another, a male, from  Singapore last year, informs me that there are two varieties, a large  and small. Ours are the small; he also tells me the chocolate is the  most rare.    \"I have heard a little more regarding the Siamese cats from Miss Walker,  the daughter of General Walker, who brought over one male and three  females. It seems the only pure breed is kept at the King of Siam's  palace, and the cats are very difficult to procure, for in Siam it took  three different gentlemen of great influence three months before they  could get any.    \"Their food is fish and rice boiled together until quite soft, and Miss  Walker finds the kittens bred have thriven on it.    \"It is my intention to try and breed from a white English female with  blue eyes, and a Siamese male.    \"The Siamese cats are very prolific breeders, having generally five at  each litter, and three litters a year.    \"We have never succeeded in breeding any like our chocolate cat; they  all come fawn, with black or dark brown points; the last family are a  little darker on their backs, which gives them a richer appearance than  the pale fawn. Hitherto we have never had any half-bred Siamese; but  there used to be a male Siamese at Hurworth-on-Tees, and there were many  young bred from English cats. They invariably showed the Siamese cross  in the ground colour.\"    From the foregoing it will be seen how very difficult it is to obtain  the pure breed, even in Siam, and on reference to the Crystal Palace  catalogues from the year 1871 until 1887, I find that there were  _fifteen_ females and only _four_ males, and some of these were not  entire; and I have always understood that the latter were not allowed to  be exported, and were only got by those so fortunate as a most  extraordinary favour, as the King of Siam is most jealous of keeping the  breed entirely in Siam as royal cats.    The one exhibited by Lady Dorothy Nevill (Mrs. Poodle) had three kittens  by an English cat; but none showed any trace of the Siamese, being all  tabby.    Although Mr. Herbert Young was informed by Mr. Brennand that there is  another and a larger breed in Siam, it does not appear that any of these  have been imported; nor have we any description of them, either as to  colour, size, form, or quality of coat, or whether they resemble the  lesser variety in this or any respect, yet it is to be hoped that, ere  long, some specimens may be secured for this country.    Besides Mr. Herbert Young, I am also much indebted to the courtesy of  Mrs. Vyvyan, of Dover, who is a lover of this beautiful breed, and who  kindly sends the following information:    \"The original pair were sent from Bangkok, and it is believed that they  came from the King's Palace, where alone the breed are said to be kept  pure. At any rate they were procured as a great favour, after much delay  and great difficulty, and since that time no others have been attainable  by the same person. We were in China when they reached us, and the  following year, 1886, we brought the father, mother, and a pair of  kittens to England.    \"Their habits are in general the same as the common cat, though it has  been observed by strangers, 'there is a pleasant wild animal odour,'  which is not apparent to us.    \"Most of the kittens have a kink in the tail; it varies in position,  sometimes in the middle, close to the body, or at the extreme end like a  hook.\""]]]
