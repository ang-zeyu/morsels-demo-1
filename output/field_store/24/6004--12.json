I have been very agreeable lately, as it was not  in my power to be otherwise. I have, moreover, a deal of wit: and the  ladies say that no one understands flattery better, or falsehoods you  will add; since the one accomplishment invariably accompanies the  other. But I must tell you of Miss B--. She has abundance of soul,  which flashes from her deep blue eyes. Her rank is a torment to her, and  satisfies no one desire of her heart. She would gladly retire from  this whirl of fashion, and we often picture to ourselves a life of  undisturbed happiness in distant scenes of rural retirement: and then we  speak of you, my dear Charlotte; for she knows you, and renders homage  to your merits; but her homage is not exacted, but voluntary, she loves  you, and delights to hear you made the subject of conversation.    Oh, that I were sitting at your feet in your favourite little room, with  the dear children playing around us! If they became troublesome to you,  I would tell them some appalling goblin story; and they would crowd  round me with silent attention. The sun is setting in glory; his last  rays are shining on the snow, which covers the face of the country: the  storm is over, and I must return to my dungeon. Adieu!--Is Albert with  you? and what is he to you? God forgive the question.    FEBRUARY 8.    For a week past we have had the most wretched weather: but this to me  is a blessing; for, during my residence here, not a single fine day has  beamed from the heavens, but has been lost to me by the intrusion  of somebody. During the severity of rain, sleet, frost, and storm, I  congratulate myself that it cannot be worse indoors than abroad, nor  worse abroad than it is within doors; and so I become reconciled. When  the sun rises bright in the morning, and promises a glorious day, I  never omit to exclaim, \"There, now, they have another blessing  from Heaven, which they will be sure to destroy: they spoil  everything,--health, fame, happiness, amusement; and they do this  generally through folly, ignorance, or imbecility, and always, according  to their own account, with the best intentions!\" I could often  beseech them, on my bended knees, to be less resolved upon their own  destruction.    FEBRUARY 17.    I fear that my ambassador and I shall not continue much longer together.  He is really growing past endurance. He transacts his business in so  ridiculous a manner, that I am often compelled to contradict him, and do  things my own way; and then, of course, he thinks them very ill done. He  complained of me lately on this account at court; and the minister gave  me a reprimand,--a gentle one it is true, but still a reprimand. In  consequence of this, I was about to tender my resignation, when I  received a letter, to which I submitted with great respect, on  account of the high, noble, and generous spirit which dictated it. He  endeavoured to soothe my excessive sensibility, paid a tribute to my  extreme ideas of duty, of good example, and of perseverance in business,  as the fruit of my youthful ardour, an impulse which he did not seek  to destroy, but only to moderate, that it might have proper play and be  productive of good. So now I am at rest for another week, and no longer  at variance with myself. Content and peace of mind are valuable things:  I could wish, my dear friend, that these precious jewels were less  transitory.    FEBRUARY 20.    God bless you, my dear friends, and may he grant you that happiness  which he denies to me!    I thank you, Albert, for having deceived me. I waited for the news that  your wedding-day was fixed; and I intended on that day, with solemnity,  to take down Charlotte's profile from the wall, and to bury it with  some other papers I possess. You are now united, and her picture still  remains here. Well, let it remain! Why should it not? I know that I  am still one of your society, that I still occupy a place uninjured in  Charlotte's heart, that I hold the second place therein; and I intend  to keep it. Oh, I should become mad if she could forget! Albert, that  thought is hell! Farewell, Albert farewell, angel of heaven farewell,  Charlotte!    MARCH 15.    I have just had a sad adventure, which will drive me away from here. I  lose all patience!--Death!--It is not to be remedied; and you alone are  to blame, for you urged and impelled me to fill a post for which I was  by no means suited. I have now reason to be satisfied, and so have you!  But, that you may not again attribute this fatality to my impetuous  temper, I send you, my dear sir, a plain and simple narration of the  affair, as a mere chronicler of facts would describe it.    The Count of O--likes and distinguishes me. It is well known, and I have  mentioned this to you a hundred times. Yesterday I dined with him. It is  the day on which the nobility are accustomed to assemble at his house  in the evening. I never once thought of the assembly, nor that we  subalterns did not belong to such society. Well, I dined with the count;  and, after dinner, we adjourned to the large hall. We walked up and down  together: and I conversed with him, and with Colonel B--, who joined us;  and in this manner the hour for the assembly approached. God knows, I  was thinking of nothing, when who should enter but the honourable Lady  accompanied by her noble husband and their silly, scheming daughter,  with her small waist and flat neck; and, with disdainful looks and a  haughty air they passed me by. As I heartily detest the whole race,  I determined upon going away; and only waited till the count had  disengaged himself from their impertinent prattle, to take leave, when  the agreeable Miss B--came in. As I never meet her without experiencing  a heartfelt pleasure, I stayed and talked to her, leaning over the  back of her chair, and did not perceive, till after some time, that she  seemed a little confused, and ceased to answer me with her usual ease  of manner. I was struck with it. \"Heavens!\" I said to myself, \"can she,  too, be like the rest?\" I felt annoyed, and was about to withdraw; but I  remained, notwithstanding, forming excuses for her conduct, fancying she  did not mean it, and still hoping to receive some friendly recognition.  The rest of the company now arrived. There was the Baron F--, in an  entire suit that dated from the coronation of Francis I.; the Chancellor  N--, with his deaf wife; the shabbily-dressed I--, whose old-fashioned  coat bore evidence of modern repairs: this crowned the whole.  I conversed with some of my acquaintances, but they answered me  laconically. I was engaged in observing Miss B--, and did not notice  that the women were whispering at the end of the room, that the murmur  extended by degrees to the men, that Madame S--addressed the count with  much warmth (this was all related to me subsequently by Miss B--); till  at length the count came up to me, and took me to the window. \"You know  our ridiculous customs,\" he said. \"I perceive the company is rather  displeased at your being here. I would not on any account--\" \"I beg  your excellency's pardon!\" I exclaimed. \"I ought to have thought of  this before, but I know you will forgive this little inattention. I was  going,\" I added, \"some time ago, but my evil genius detained me.\" And I  smiled and bowed, to take my leave. He shook me by the hand, in a manner  which expressed everything. I hastened at once from the illustrious  assembly, sprang into a carriage, and drove to M--. I contemplated the  setting sun from the top of the hill, and read that beautiful passage in  Homer, where Ulysses is entertained by the hospitable herdsmen. This was  indeed delightful.    I returned home to supper in the evening. But few persons were assembled  in the room. They had turned up a corner of the table-cloth, and were  playing at dice. The good-natured A--came in. He laid down his hat when  he saw me, approached me, and said in a low tone, \"You have met with  a disagreeable adventure.\" \"I!\" I exclaimed. \"The count obliged you to  withdraw from the assembly!\" \"Deuce take the assembly!\" said I. \"I was  very glad to be gone.\" \"I am delighted,\" he added, \"that you take it  so lightly. I am only sorry that it is already so much spoken of.\" The  circumstance then began to pain me. I fancied that every one who sat  down, and even looked at me, was thinking of this incident; and my heart  became embittered.    And now I could plunge a dagger into my bosom, when I hear myself  everywhere pitied, and observe the triumph of my enemies, who say that  this is always the case with vain persons, whose heads are turned with  conceit, who affect to despise forms and such petty, idle nonsense.    Say what you will of fortitude, but show me the man who can patiently  endure the laughter of fools, when they have obtained an advantage over  him. 'Tis only when their nonsense is without foundation that one can  suffer it without complaint.    March 16.    Everything conspires against me. I met Miss B--walking to-day. I could  not help joining her; and, when we were at a little distance from her  companions, I expressed my sense of her altered manner toward me. \"O  Werther!\" she said, in a tone of emotion, \"you, who know my heart, how  could you so ill interpret my distress? What did I not suffer for you,  from the moment you entered the room! I foresaw it all, a hundred times  was I on the point of mentioning it to you. I knew that the S----s and  T----s, with their husbands, would quit the room, rather than remain in  your company. I knew that the count would not break with them: and  now so much is said about it.\" \"How!\" I exclaimed, and endeavoured to  conceal my emotion; for all that Adelin had mentioned to me yesterday  recurred to me painfully at that moment. \"Oh, how much it has already  cost me!\" said this amiable girl, while her eyes filled with tears.  I could scarcely contain myself, and was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25282"],[0,"The Jewish State (#13)"],[1,"theirs. But I wish from the  outset to prevent any misconception from arising, particularly the  mistaken notion that my project, if realized, would in the least  degree injure property now held by Jews. I shall therefore explain  everything connected with rights of property very fully. Whereas, if  my plan never becomes anything more than a piece of literature, things  will merely remain as they are. It might more reasonably be objected  that I am giving a handle to Anti-Semitism when I say we are a  people--one people; that I am hindering the assimilation of Jews where  it is about to be consummated, and endangering it where it is an  accomplished fact, insofar as it is possible for a solitary writer to  hinder or endanger anything.    This objection will be especially brought forward in France. It will  probably also be made in other countries, but I shall answer only the  French Jews beforehand, because these afford the most striking example  of my point.    However much I may worship personality--powerful individual  personality in statesmen, inventors, artists, philosophers, or  leaders, as well as the collective personality of a historic group of  human beings, which we call a nation--however much I may worship  personality, I do not regret its disappearance. Whoever can, will, and  must perish, let him perish. But the distinctive nationality of Jews  neither can, will, nor must be destroyed. It cannot be destroyed,  because external enemies consolidate it. It will not be destroyed;  this is shown during two thousand years of appalling suffering. It  must not be destroyed, and that, as a descendant of numberless Jews  who refused to despair, I am trying once more to prove in this  pamphlet. Whole branches of Judaism may wither and fall, but the trunk  will remain.    Hence, if all or any of the French Jews protest against this scheme on  account of their own \"assimilation,\" my answer is simple: The whole  thing does not concern them at all. They are Jewish Frenchmen, well  and good! This is a private affair for the Jews alone.    The movement towards the organization of the State I am proposing  would, of course, harm Jewish Frenchmen no more than it would harm the  \"assimilated\" of other countries. It would, on the contrary, be  distinctly to their advantage. For they would no longer be disturbed  in their \"chromatic function,\" as Darwin puts it, but would be able to  assimilate in peace, because the present Anti-Semitism would have been  stopped for ever. They would certainly be credited with being  assimilated to the very depths of their souls, if they stayed where  they were after the new Jewish State, with its superior institutions,  had become a reality.    The \"assimilated\" would profit even more than Christian citizens by  the departure of faithful Jews; for they would be rid of the  disquieting, incalculable, and unavoidable rivalry of a Jewish  proletariat, driven by poverty and political pressure from place to  place, from land to land. This floating proletariat would become  stationary. Many Christian citizens--whom we call Anti-Semites--can  now offer determined resistance to the immigration of foreign Jews.  Jewish citizens cannot do this, although it affects them far more  directly; for on them they feel first of all the keen competition of  individuals carrying on similar branches of industry, who, in  addition, either introduce Anti-Semitism where it does not exist, or  intensify it where it does. The \"assimilated\" give expression to this  secret grievance in \"philanthropic\" undertakings. They organize  emigration societies for wandering Jews. There is a reverse to the  picture which would be comic, if it did not deal with human beings.  For some of these charitable institutions are created not for, but  against, persecuted Jews; they are created to despatch these poor  creatures just as fast and far as possible. And thus, many an apparent  friend of the Jews turns out, on careful inspection, to be nothing  more than an Anti-Semite of Jewish origin, disguised as a  philanthropist.    But the attempts at colonization made even by really benevolent men,  interesting attempts though they were, have so far been unsuccessful.  I do not think that this or that man took up the matter merely as an  amusement, that they engaged in the emigration of poor Jews as one  indulges in the racing of horses. The matter was too grave and tragic  for such treatment. These attempts were interesting, in that they  represented on a small scale the practical fore-runners of the idea of  a Jewish State. They were even useful, for out of their mistakes may  be gathered experience for carrying the idea out successfully on a  larger scale. They have, of course, done harm also. The transportation  of Anti-Semitism to new districts, which is the inevitable consequence  of such artificial infiltration, seems to me to be the least of these  evils. Far worse is the circumstance that unsatisfactory results tend  to cast doubts on intelligent men. What is impractical or impossible  to simple argument will remove this doubt from the minds of  intelligent men. What is unpractical or impossible to accomplish on a  small scale, need not necessarily be so on a larger one. A small  enterprise may result in loss under the same conditions which would  make a large one pay. A rivulet cannot even be navigated by boats, the  river into which it flows carries stately iron vessels.    No human being is wealthy or powerful enough to transplant a nation  from one habitation to another. An idea alone can achieve that and  this idea of a State may have the requisite power to do so. The Jews  have dreamt this kingly dream all through the long nights of their  history. \"Next year in Jerusalem\" is our old phrase. It is now a  question of showing that the dream can be converted into a living  reality.    For this, many old, outgrown, confused and limited notions must first  be entirely erased from the minds of men. Dull brains might, for  instance, imagine that this exodus would be from civilized regions  into the desert. That is not the case. It will be carried out in the  midst of civilization. We shall not revert to a lower stage, we shall  rise to a higher one. We shall not dwell in mud huts; we shall build  new more beautiful and more modern houses, and possess them in safety.  We shall not lose our acquired possessions; we shall realize them. We  shall surrender our well earned rights only for better ones. We shall  not sacrifice our beloved customs; we shall find them again. We shall  not leave our old home before the new one is prepared for us. Those  only will depart who are sure thereby to improve their position; those  who are now desperate will go first, after them the poor; next the  prosperous, and, last of all, the wealthy. Those who go in advance  will raise themselves to a higher grade, equal to those whose  representatives will shortly follow. Thus the exodus will be at the  same time an ascent of the class.    The departure of the Jews will involve no economic disturbances, no  crises, no persecutions; in fact, the countries they abandon will  revive to a new period of prosperity. There will be an inner migration  of Christian citizens into the positions evacuated by Jews. The  outgoing current will be gradual, without any disturbance, and its  initial movement will put an end to Anti-Semitism. The Jews will leave  as honored friends, and if some of them return, they will receive the  same favorable welcome and treatment at the hands of civilized nations  as is accorded to all foreign visitors. Their exodus will have no  resemblance to a flight, for it will be a well-regulated movement  under control of public opinion. The movement will not only be  inaugurated with absolute conformity to law, but it cannot even be  carried out without the friendly cooperation of interested  Governments, who would derive considerable benefits from it.    Security for the integrity of the idea and the vigor of its execution  will be found in the creation of a body corporate, or corporation.  This corporation will be called \"The Society of Jews.\" In addition to  it there will be a Jewish company, an economically productive body.    An individual who attempted even to undertake this huge task alone  would be either an impostor or a madman. The personal character of the  members of the corporation will guarantee its integrity, and the  adequate capital of the Company will prove its stability.    These prefatory remarks are merely intended as a hasty reply to the  mass of objections which the very words \"Jewish State\" are certain to  arouse. Henceforth we shall proceed more slowly to meet further  objections and to explain in detail what has been as yet only  indicated; and we shall try in the interests of this pamphlet to  avoid making it a dull exposition. Short aphoristic chapters will  therefore best answer the purpose.    If I wish to substitute a new building for an old one, I must demolish  before I construct. I shall therefore keep to this natural sequence.  In the first and general part I shall explain my ideas, remove all  prejudices, determine essential political and economic conditions, and  develop the plan.    In the special part, which is divided into three principal sections, I  shall describe its execution. These three sections are: The Jewish  Company, Local Groups, and the Society of Jews. The Society is to be  created first, the Company last; but in this exposition the reverse  order is preferable, because it is the financial soundness of the  enterprise which will chiefly be called into question, and doubts on  this score must be removed first.    In the conclusion, I shall try to meet every further objection that  could possibly be made. My Jewish readers will, I hope, follow me  patiently to the end. Some will naturally make their objections in an  order of succession other than that chosen for their refutation. But  "]]]
