[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31234"],[0,"A History of the English Church in New Zealand (#13)"],[1,"pathetic was the fear  expressed by the older Maoris lest the white man should cut away this  frail support of their hope of a future life: \"Let the young men go with  you to your heaven, but leave us our ladder to the Reinga.\" The  missionary left them their ladder; but he told them on his return to  Kaitaia that, whereas a death had occurred there during his absence, he  had seen no bunches of grass on the road, such as they believed to be  left by the spirits while passing up the coast. The old superstitions  were clearly shaken, and the better faith soon took a powerful hold upon  the people of the north.    Though this first attempt at an extension of the work was encouraging,  it meant but little for the rest of New Zealand. Until a real attack  could be made upon the south, the work could hardly be said to have  begun in earnest. The land and the people were for the most part  unknown, but a venture of faith must be made. This venture was begun in  the October of 1833 under the leadership of Henry Williams, and  constitutes one of the turning points in the history of New Zealand.    Besides the leader and the Rev. A. N. Brown, the expedition consisted of  Messrs. Fairburn and Morgan with a party of Maoris. They left the Bay of  Islands on October 22nd in open boats. The nights were spent on various  islands, which they found to be all deserted, though everywhere they  could see the remains of fortifications and villages. Where now the  merchants of Auckland have their summer residences, there were no living  beings to share the morning devotions of the missionaries, save the  birds with their melodious songs. On the site of the Mokoia _pa_, where  Marsden had so often received the hospitality of Hinaki, they could see  nothing but fern and fuchsia bushes, with here and there an axe-cloven  skull. Proceeding down the Hauraki Gulf, the same scenes presented  themselves, until at last a little smoke was noticed on the Coromandel  coast. A fortnight's travel brought them to Kopu at the head of the  gulf--175 miles in a straight line from the Bay of Islands. Here they  entered the Thames or Waihou River, and were carried up it by the tide.  On their left was a wooded range of hills, and on the right a flat  forest that extended as far as the eye could reach.    Habitations now became increasingly frequent, but the villages were all  new, and among them appeared the remains of old _pas_ which had been  destroyed by Hongi. Strange stories, too, were told to the visitors of a  miserable remnant of the old inhabitants, who still lingered on in the  forest which lay to the right hand of the travellers. The whole of this  country was submerged from time to time by the flooded rivers, and no  one knew or could conjecture how these people lived. The smoke of their  fires was occasionally seen, but they never held any communication with  the people who had come to occupy the river banks.    By the evening of the second day the travellers arrived at a settlement  that seemed to be of some importance. Now at last they had reached the  heathen country, and could begin their mission to the south. Some 200  natives crowded round to see the visitors, those in the rear holding  torches to increase the illumination. The missionaries began their  Evensong with one of the Maori hymns which they were accustomed to sing  at Paihia. Hardly had they sung a line when, to their intense surprise,  the whole of the audience joined heartily in the tune. Trembling with  excitement the reader began the Evening Prayer, and when he uttered the  words, \"O Lord, open Thou our lips,\" there came from a hundred manly  voices the significant response, \"And our mouth shall show forth Thy  praise.\" So it continued throughout. Canticle and creed, prayer and  hymn, were all known to these presumably heathen people. At the  conclusion of the service the secret was discovered. Three of their boys  had been taught at Paihia. Here was the first fruit of the mission  schools.    For some days longer the journey up the river continued, the object  being to gain an interview with the chief potentate of the region, the  celebrated Waharoa. On leaving the river a dreary march began through  woods and swamps. Henry Williams was carried on two poles by native  bearers who often sank in mud up to their chests. At last they emerged  into a beautiful park-like country, where stood Matamata, the _pa_ of  Waharoa. The old man was very gracious. Though his career had been  almost as bloodstained as was that of Hongi, he made a favourable  impression upon the missionaries, and \"asked many significant questions  about religion.\" He was keenly desirous of a mission settlement in his  _pa_. Williams discussed with him many plans for an extension of the  work. \"This conversation,\" says Carleton, \"was the clue to all  subsequent proceedings.\"    Returning down the river, a site was chosen for a station at Puriri. The  spot lay amongst flax swamps on a tributary of the Thames. It was  somewhat damp and unhealthy, but it was centrally situated as regards  the tribes of the neighbourhood. Before the end of the year it was  occupied by Morgan, Preece, and Wilson, who found raupo houses already  erected for them by the Maoris.    The Thames expedition had proved beyond a doubt that the land lay open  to mission enterprise. But the surprises which it offered were not  always pleasant ones. Early in the year 1836 Brown and Hamlin, with some  Maori converts, started overland to explore the Waikato. The Kaipara and  Tamaki districts were waste and uninhabited, nor were any human beings  seen, till they struck the great river itself. In the absence of canoes  they essayed to cross it on _mokis_ or bundles of flax-stalks. These  rafts were so satisfactory that they paddled down the stream for some  distance, when they were met by a boat containing an Englishman and a  younger brother of Te Wherowhero--afterwards well known as the Maori  King, Potatau. The strangers were friendly, but their remarks were  uncomfortably direct. \"Why did you not come before?\" they asked. \"You  have stayed so long in the Bay of Islands that surely your children are  old enough to be missionaries. If you had come among us some time ago,  the Taranakis would have been alive, but now we have cut them nearly all  off.\"    The opening thus indicated could no longer be neglected. A few months  later a second expedition was directed towards the same quarter, though  by a different route. It consisted of Messrs. W. Williams, Brown, and  Morgan, and they had with them the speaker of the sharp rebuke above  mentioned. Approaching from the side of the Thames Valley they reached  Ngaruawahia, at the confluence of the Waikato and Waipa rivers. Boating  up the Waipa until they could pull no longer, they landed at Mangapouri  near Pirongia. So pleased were they with the place that they decided to  fix a station there. The local chief at once offered land, and set men  at work to clear it, though a few months necessarily elapsed before it  could be actually occupied.    Mr. Williams and his colleagues meanwhile journeyed back into the Thames  Valley, and, after promising Waharoa to send him a teacher as soon as  possible, passed on to the Bay of Plenty. At Tauranga a large gathering  of the inhabitants was held. They had evidently not forgotten the  efforts which had been made four years before by Henry Williams to save  their settlement from the wrath of the Ngapuhi. They had come to realise  that the missionaries actually cared for other tribes as well as for the  favoured Ngapuhi; they felt that a mission station would help in the  preservation of peace; and they undertook to build houses in readiness  for the teachers who should come.    The year 1835 saw the opening of the four new stations. Hamlin and Stack  settled at Mangapouri; Brown and Morgan at Matamata; Wilson at Tauranga;  and Chapman near Ohinemutu, amidst the hot springs and geysers of  Rotorua. It will be noticed that these frontier posts were occupied  mainly by the new men who had not acquired much knowledge of the  language or of the customs of the Maori. Some misunderstandings were  bound to arise from this cause, and Wilson nearly lost his life at  Puriri, but soon a more peaceful state of things ensued. Everything  seemed bright and hopeful when, on Christmas Day, a horrible murder  occurred at Rotorua, which kindled a fresh war, and threw the work into  confusion for several years.    The details of the war lie, of course, outside our subject: it will  suffice to notice those points at which it touched the missionary band.  The Rotorua station was naturally the first to feel its effects. Mr.  Chapman did his utmost to check the outbreak of hostilities, and having  secured the head of the murdered man he had it conveyed to the  relatives. But the victim was a chief of high rank and nearly related to  Waharoa. It was incumbent therefore upon that redoubtable warrior to  obtain _utu_ for the slaughter of his relative. He was still a heathen,  and was deaf to the exhortations of the Christians. \"How sweet,\" he  said, \"will taste the flesh of the Rotoruas along with their new  kumeras!\" It was not long before he was able to gratify this wolfish  taste, and in the confusion which followed the assault upon the  Ohinemutu _pa_ the missionary premises were looted. They were at the  time in charge of two young assistants, Knight and Pilley--the former  being a nephew of Marsden. Both were felled to the ground, wounded and  stripped of their clothes. Chapman and his wife were fortunately absent.  Mrs. Chapman after many dangers reached Matamata, but the tide of war  rolled thither also, and the mission ladies were hurried through the  swamps to the river bank. Here they were met unexpectedly by Fairburn  and Wilson, who had been rowing up the Waihou for the last two days in  the endeavour to bring help to their colleagues at Rotorua. Wilson in  his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31425"],[0,"Report of the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the (#13)"],[1,"to account for the phraseology used,  when compared with other grants of power--and also for its association  with the other provisions in the same clause.    The Constitution has always been remarkable for the felicity of its  arrangement of different subjects, and the perspicuity and  appropriateness of the language it uses. But if this clause is  construed to extend to territory acquired by the present Government  from a foreign nation, outside of the limits of any charter from the  British Government to a colony, it would be difficult to say, why it  was deemed necessary to give the Government the power to sell any  vacant lands belonging to the sovereignty which might be found within  it; and if this was necessary, why the grant of this power should  precede the power to legislate over it and establish a Government  there; and still more difficult to say, why it was deemed necessary so  specially and particularly to grant the power to make needful rules  and regulations in relation to any personal or movable property it  might acquire there. For the words, _other property_ necessarily, by  every known rule of interpretation, must mean property of a different  description from territory or land. And the difficulty would perhaps  be insurmountable in endeavoring to account for the last member of the  sentence, which provides that \"nothing in this Constitution shall be  so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States or any  particular State,\" or to say how any particular State could have  claims in or to a territory ceded by a foreign Government, or to  account for associating this provision with the preceding provisions  of the clause, with which it would appear to have no connection.    The words \"needful rules and regulations\" would seem, also, to have  been cautiously used for some definite object. They are not the words  usually employed by statesmen, when they mean to give the powers of  sovereignty, or to establish a Government, or to authorize its  establishment. Thus, in the law to renew and keep alive the ordinance  of 1787, and to re-establish the Government, the title of the law is:  \"An act to provide for the government of the territory northwest of  the river Ohio.\" And in the Constitution, when granting the power to  legislate over the territory that may be selected for the seat of  Government independently of a State, it does not say Congress shall  have power \"to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the  territory;\" but it declares that \"Congress shall have power to  exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such  District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of  particular States and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of  the Government of the United States.\"    The words \"rules and regulations\" are usually employed in the  Constitution in speaking of some particular specified power which it  means to confer on the Government, and not, as we have seen, when  granting general powers of legislation. As, for example, in the  particular power to Congress \"to make rules for the government and  regulation of the land and naval forces, or the particular and  specific power to regulate commerce;\" \"to establish an uniform _rule_  of naturalization;\" \"to coin money and _regulate_ the value thereof.\"  And to construe the words of which we are speaking as a general and  unlimited grant of sovereignty over territories which the Government  might afterwards acquire, is to use them in a sense and for a purpose  for which they were not used in any other part of the instrument. But  if confined to a particular Territory, in which a Government and laws  had already been established, but which would require some alterations  to adapt it to the new Government, the words are peculiarly applicable  and appropriate for that purpose.    The necessity of this special provision in relation to property and  the rights or property held in common by the confederated States, is  illustrated by the first clause of the sixth article. This clause  provides that \"all debts, contracts, and engagements entered into  before the adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against  the United States under this Government as under the Confederation.\"  This provision, like the one under consideration, was indispensable if  the new Constitution was adopted. The new Government was not a mere  change in a dynasty, or in a form of government, leaving the nation or  sovereignty the same, and clothed with all the rights, and bound by  all the obligations of the preceding one. But, when the present United  States came into existence under the new Government, it was a new  political body, a new nation, then for the first time taking its place  in the family of nations. It took nothing by succession from the  Confederation. It had no right, as its successor, to any property or  rights of property which it had acquired, and was not liable for any  of its obligations. It was evidently viewed in this light by the  framers of the Constitution. And as the several states would cease to  exist in their former confederated character upon the adoption of the  Constitution, and could not, in that character, again assemble  together, special provisions were indispensable to transfer to the new  Government the property and rights which at that time they held in  common; and at the same time to authorize it to lay taxes and  appropriate money to pay the common debt which they had contracted;  and this power could only be given to it by special provisions in the  Constitution. The clause in relation to the territory and other  property of the United States provided for the first, and the clause  last quoted provided for the other. They have no connection with the  general powers and rights of sovereignty delegated to the new  Government, and can neither enlarge nor diminish them. They were  inserted to meet a present emergency, and not to regulate its powers  as a Government.    Indeed, a similar provision was deemed necessary, in relation to  treaties made by the Confederation; and when in the clause next  succeeding the one of which we have last spoken, it is declared that  treaties shall be the supreme law of the land, care is taken to  include, by express words, the treaties made by the confederated  States. The language is: \"and all treaties made, or which shall be  made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme  law of the land.\"    Whether, therefore, we take the particular clause in question, by  itself, or in connection with the other provisions of the  Constitution, we think it clear, that it applies only to the  particular territory of which we have spoken, and cannot, by any just  rule of interpretation, be extended to territory which the new  Government might afterwards obtain from a foreign nation.  Consequently, the power which Congress may have lawfully exercised in  this Territory, while it remained under a Territorial Government, and  which may have been sanctioned by judicial decision, can furnish no  justification and no argument to support a similar exercise of power  over territory afterwards acquired by the Federal Government. We put  aside, therefore, any argument, drawn from precedents, showing the  extent of the power which the General Government exercised over  slavery in this Territory, as altogether inapplicable to the case  before us.    But the case of the American and Ocean Insurance Companies _v._ Canter  (1 Pet., 511) has been quoted as establishing a different construction  of this clause of the Constitution. There is, however, not the  slightest conflict between the opinion now given and the one referred  to; and it is only by taking a single sentence out of the latter and  separating it from the context, that even an appearance of conflict  can be shown. We need not comment on such a mode of expounding an  opinion of the court. Indeed it most commonly misrepresents instead of  expounding it. And this is fully exemplified in the case referred to,  where, if one sentence is taken by itself, the opinion would appear to  be in direct conflict with that now given; but the words which  immediately follow that sentence show that the court did not mean to  decide the point, but merely affirmed the power of Congress to  establish a Government in the Territory, leaving it an open question,  whether that power was derived from this clause in the Constitution,  or was to be necessarily inferred from a power to acquire territory by  cession from a foreign Government. The opinion on this part of the  case is short, and we give the whole of it to show how well the  selection of a single sentence is calculated to mislead.    The passage referred to is in page 542, in which the court, in  speaking of the power of Congress to establish a Territorial  Government in Florida until it should become a State, uses the  following language:    \"In the mean time Florida continues to be a Territory of the United  States, governed by that clause of the Constitution which empowers  Congress to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the  territory or other property of the United States. Perhaps the power of  governing a territory belonging to the United States, which has not,  by becoming a State, acquired the means of self-government, may  result, necessarily, from the facts that it is not within the  jurisdiction of any particular State, and is within the power and  jurisdiction of the United States. The right to govern may be the  inevitable consequence of the right to acquire territory. _Whichever  may be the source from which the power is derived, the possession of  it is unquestionable._\"    It is thus clear, from the whole opinion on this point, that the court  did not mean to decide whether the power was derived from the clause  in the Constitution, or was the necessary consequence of the right to  acquire. They do decide that the "]]]
