Secret agents will       communicate to me the names of those who do. Those who do not       avail themselves of the terms now offered may be sure that       their property will be confiscated when the troops arrive. Each       man must be prepared to hand over a rifle and 150 rounds of       ammunition. The above terms do not apply to officers and       members of the Staats artillery, who may surrender as prisoners       of war at any time, nor to rebels on British territory.         \"It is probable that my force will shortly take the offensive.

BADEN-POWELL, Colonel, Mafeking, December 10.\"    If this warning did nothing else, it certainly had the effect of  touching General Snyman in a soft spot, for he at once wrote to his  Burghers in fiery language, expressing his disapproval that such a  communication should have been addressed direct to them. The idea that  \"sitting and looking at a place is not the way to take it\" seems to have  gone home to him, for he promptly challenged the besieged to come out  and drive him away!    On the same day as his address to the Burghers the Colonel wrote home to  a relative in England, and sent the missive folded in a quill, which was  in its turn rammed into the pipe of a Kaffir:--      \"MAFEKING, _Dec._ 12, 1899.    \"All going well with me. To-day I have been trying to find any old  Carthusians in the place to have a Carthusian dinner together, as it is  Founder's Day; but so far, for a wonder, I believe I am the only one  among the odd thousand people here.    \"This is our sixtieth day of the siege, and I do believe we're beginning  to get a little tired of it; but I suppose, like other things, it will  come to an end some day. I have got such an interesting collection of  mementoes of it to bring home. I wonder if Baden[1] is in the country?  What fun if he should come up to relieve me!    \"I don't know if this letter will get through the Boer outposts, but if  it does, I hope it will find you very well and flourishing.\"      KIMBERLEY    At Kimberley on November 4 things were still cheerful, though short  commons had begun to be enforced. The Transvaalers advanced on  Kenilworth, and Major Peakman with a squadron of the Kimberley Light  Horse, emerging suddenly from the bush, gave them a warm reception.  Colonel Scott-Turner reinforced Major Peakman, and two guns were sent to  support him against the enemy's guns, which at that juncture ceased  firing. The enemy's fire with one piece of artillery was on the whole  poor, and fortunately little serious damage was done. Later in the  afternoon came another encounter with the enemy, an encounter which was  kept up till dusk, and in which the enemy sustained considerable loss.  Unfortunately Major Ayliff of the Cape Police, a brave and efficient  officer, was wounded in the neck. The Boers occupied the Kampersdam  mine, some five miles distant, and shelled the Otto Kopje mine, while  the manager, Mr. Chapman, like a Spartan, watched the destruction of his  property and kept Colonel Kekewich informed as to the damage done. This  was luckily small. On November 6 General Cronje sent a message to  Colonel Kekewich calling on him to surrender, otherwise the town would  be bombarded, and on the following day a force of Free State artillery,  supported by a large commando, began further offensive operations.  Captain Brown, who rode out a short distance to Alexandersfontein, was  captured, and stripped by the Boers because he would reveal nothing  regarding the state of the town.    [Illustration: PLAN OF KIMBERLEY AND ENVIRONS]    [Illustration: ARMY SERVICE CORPS.    Photo by Gregory & Co., London.]    According to rough calculation, the opposing forces at Kimberley early  in November stood thus:--      Four companies of the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment;    battery of Royal Garrison Artillery, consisting of six    7-pounder mountain guns; a large party of Royal    Engineers; detachment of the Army Medical Corps              2500      In addition to these were the following irregular troops:--      One battery Diamond Fields Artillery with six 7-pounder    field guns, 3 officers and 90 non-commissioned officers    and men; Diamond Fields Horse, 6 officers and 142 non-    commissioned officers and men; Kimberley Regiment, 14    officers and 285 non-commissioned officers and men            540      Free Staters, and probably some Transvaal Boers, with four    field-guns, 3500; on Orange River, 2000; reinforcements    from Mafeking, 1000                                          6500    The disparity was not enlivening, but, though provisions were beginning  to run low, pluck was inexhaustible. And with pluck, as with faith, one  may move mountains.    On the 11th of November the bombardment of the town was commenced with  great vigour, the Boers firing from three positions. Little serious  damage was done, owing to the fact that many of the shells did not  burst. In spite of the incessant brawling of artillery, the perpetual  appearance of fog, and a stinging pall of smoke in which they lived, the  inhabitants of the place kept up an air of cheery unconcern, which  naturally they were far from feeling. They also determined to disquiet  the enemy by continual threats of attack from unexpected quarters. With  the spirit of philosophers they at times made small divertisements for  themselves. Once when a cooking-pot was struck the debris were put up to  auction, and some fun was got out of the brisk competition for the  historic relics. Some of the choicest of these were knocked down--this  time not by guns--for the sum of L2 a piece. The price of a complete  shell was about L5, and portions of one could be purchased at  proportionate rates. Bits and fragments fetched sums varying from half a  crown to half a sovereign!    Nothing further happened, save that a cabdriver was captured,  interrogated, threatened, and finally set free. Commandant Wessels, who  sounded him regarding the dynamite mines round Kimberley, concluded with  the message--a typical specimen of Boer braggadocio--\"Tell Rhodes I  shall take Wesselton mine next Tuesday, and then he must stand  whiskies!\"    On the 12th Lord Methuen, on whom all had pinned their faith, arrived  with his staff at the Orange River. This was a red-letter day. The news  of British relief so close at hand was most inspiriting, and those  whose patience was inclined to languish began to take heart. In  Kimberley itself the weather was fine and warm, and as yet little ill  consequence from the shelling was suffered. A peacock was killed, some  buildings damaged, some nervous persons terrified. The military  authorities issued a proclamation ordering that all people not engaged  with the defensive forces should give up arms and ammunition, a decision  that was found necessary to prevent irresponsible persons from  infringing the laws of civilised warfare.    On the 17th of November a force composed of detachments of the Diamond  Fields Horse, Kimberley Light Horse, and Cape Police, under Colonel  Scott Turner, went out with a field-gun and two Maxims to ascertain the  strength of the enemy's position at Lazaretto Ridge. The enemy, who were  posted on a rocky mound between Carter's Farm and the reservoir, opened  fire on the advancing men, who, though some vigorous volleys were  returned, were obliged to retire. Meanwhile the Beaconsfield Town Guard  had a tussle with the foe, and, after much firing on either side, he  eventually retired. As usual, he hid behind rocks and stones, and made  himself generally inaccessible. On the following day some smart  engagements ensued, and so brisk was the volleying from rifles and the  booming of field-guns, that the townspeople believed that some decisive  battle must be taking place. There were, however, few casualties.    All eyes were now fixed on the doings of the Kimberley relief force that  was concentrating at Orange River. A few more weeks, nay, a few more  days, and those patient, cheery prisoners would march out free to have  their reckoning with the Boers. Lord Methuen, once joined by the  Coldstream Guards, Grenadiers, and Naval Brigade, would be able to push  on, and then the first big move in the war would be made. So they hoped,  and with reason, for an electric searchlight, worked by the Naval  Brigade under Colonel Ernest Rhodes, was signalling to Kimberley, whose  searchlights were plainly visible to the advancing army.    To the dreary imprisoned inhabitants this mode of communication was  vastly exciting. Every day the relief column was approaching nearer and  nearer, and the patient though longing besieged began to feel as if they  were already almost liberated. They commenced preparing an enthusiastic  welcome for the incoming troops, and ironical farewell salutations were  now levied at the Boers in acknowledgment of shells and of their general  artillery prowess. At that time, coming events--the disasters of  Majesfontein and Colenso--had not cast their shadows before! Mr. Rhodes  was particularly cheery, and took most whimsically to the information  conveyed through Kaffir sources that the enemy was keenly desirous of  exhibiting him in a cage at Bloemfontein prior to despatching him to  Pretoria! The brutal manners and customs of the Boers, however, were no  subject for joke, as shown by their treatment of four \"boys\" who were  found and captured while searching for stray cattle. After killing a  couple of them, the enemy ordered the remaining two, having first  flogged them, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],[0,"Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#13)"],[1," for there is  no sort of thing that he does not supply to all parts of the  globe.    A propos of Lisbon and supplies, have you a taste for camellias?  It would be a great pleasure to me to send you a small cargo of  them from Oporto, but I did not venture to do it without knowing,  in case you might perhaps have a decided antipathy to them.    In spite of the disinterestedness with which I began this letter,  I come round, almost without knowing how, to beg you to write to  me. Don't do more than you like; but in any case forgive me for  growing old and arriving at the point when noble recollections  grow in proportion as the narrowing meannesses of daily life find  their true level. Yes, even if you thought me more of a fool than  formerly, it would be impossible for me to hold your friendship  cheap, or not to prize highly the fact that, somehow or other, it  has not come to be at variance nor entirely at an end.    As the exigencies of my profession will not allow me leisure to  return so soon to Paris, I shall probably not have the  opportunity of seeing you for two years. Towards the middle of  July I go to Bonn for the inauguration of the Beethoven Monument.  Were it not that a journey to the Rhine is so commonplace, I  should beg you to let me do the honors of the left and of the  right bank to you, as well as to Chopin (a little less badly than  I was able to do the honors of Geneva!). My mother and my  children are to join me at Cologne in five or six weeks, but I  cannot hope for such good luck as that we might meet in those  parts, although after your winters of work and fatigue a journey  of this kind would be a refreshing distraction for you both.    At the close of the autumn I shall resume my duties at Weymar;  later on I shall go to Vienna and Hungary, and proceed thence to  Italy by way of Constantinople, Athens, and Malta.    If, therefore, one of these fine days you should happen to be in  the humor, send me a word in reply about the camellias; if you  will send your letter to my mother (20, Rue Louis le Grand) I  shall get it immediately. In every way, count upon my profound  friendship and most respectful devotion always and everywhere.    Lyons, May 21st, 1845    F. Liszt        45. T Abbe De Lamennais    [Autograph in the possession of M. Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.]    Oh no, there is not, and there never could be, any indiscretion  from you towards me. Believe me that I do not deceive myself as  to the motive which determined you to write to me with such great  kindness, and if it happened that I replied too sanguinely and at  too great length I beg you to excuse me. Above all do not punish  me by withdrawing from me the smallest particle of your sacred  friendship.    M. de Lamartine, with whom I have been spending two or three days  at Montceau, told me that you had read to him \"Les Forgerons,\" so  I played him the music. Permit me still to hope that some day you  may be willing to complete the series, and that I, on my side,  may not be unworthy of this task.    Yours most heartily,    Dijon, June 1st, 1845    F. Liszt        46. To Gaetano Belloni in Paris    [Autograph in the possession of M. Etienne Charavay in Paris.--  Addressed to Liszt's valued secretary during his concert tours in  Europe from 1841-1847.]    Dear and Most Excellent Belloni,    Everything is moving on, and shall not stop either. Bonn is in a  flutter since I arrived and I shall easily put an end to the  paltry, under-hand opposition which had been formed against me.  By the time you arrive I shall have well and duly conquered my  true position.    [This refers to the Festival in Bonn, of several days' duration,  for the unveiling of the Beethoven Monument (by Hahnel), in which  Liszt, the generous joint-founder of the monument, took part as  pianist, composer, and conductor.]    Will you please add to the list of your commissions:    The cross of Charles III.    and the cross of Christ of Portugal, large size? You know it is  worn on the neck.    Don't lose time and don't be too long in coming.    Yours ever,    F. Liszt    July 23rd, 1845.    Kindest regards to Madame Belloni.--I enclose a few lines for  Benacci, which you will kindly give him.        47. To Madame Rondonneau at Sedan    [Autograph in the possession of M. Etienne Charavay in Paris.]    In spite of rain, snow, hail, and frost, here I am at last,  having reached the hotel of the Roman Emperor at Frankfort after  forty-eight hours' travelling, and I take the first opportunity  of telling you anew, though not for the last time, how much I  feel the charming and affectionate reception which you have given  me during my too short, and, unhappily for me, too unfortunate  stay at Sedan. Will you, dear Madame, be so kind as to be my  mouthpiece and special pleader to Madame Dumaitre, who has been  so uncommonly kind and cordial to me? Assuredly I could not  confide my cause (bad as it may be) to more delicate hands and to  a more persuasive eloquence, if eloquence only consists in  reality of \"the art of saying the right thing, the whole of the  right thing, and nothing but the right thing,\" as La  Rochefoucauld defined it; a definition from which General Foy  drew a grand burst of eloquence--\"The Charter, the whole Charter  (excepting, however, Article 14 and other peccadilloes!), and  nothing but the Charter.\"    \"But don't let us talk politics any longer,\" as Lablache so  happily remarked to Giulia Grisi, who took it into her head one  fine day to criticize Don Juan!    Let us talk once more of Sedan, and let me again say to you how  happy I should be to be able one day to show those whose  acquaintance I have made through you in what grateful remembrance  I keep it.    Will you, Madame, give my best and most affectionate thanks to M.  Rondonneau, and accept my very respectful and devoted homage?    F. Liszt    Frankfurt, February 11th, 1846    P.S.--Being pressed for time, and owing, perhaps, to a stupid  feeling of delicacy, I came away without paying my doctor.    If you think well, would you be so kind as to credit me with a  napoleon and give it him from me: Madame Kreutzer will be my  banker in Paris. Adieu till we meet again.        48. To Monsieur Grillparzer    [Original, without date, in the possession of the Baroness  Mayrhofer-Grunbuhel at Klagenfurt. It might belong to the year  1846, during which Liszt arranged ten concerts in Vienna, from  March 1st to May 17th, and lived there during a great part of the  summer. From the same year dates a poem of homage to the  incomparable magician of the piano from the great poet. This  slight and unimportant letter is the only one of Liszt's found  among Grillparzer's effects.]    Will you do me the favor, my dear sir, to come and dine, without  ceremony, with several of your friends and admirers on Friday  next at 3 o'clock (at the \"Stadt Frankfurt\")? I should be very  much gratified at this kindness on your part. M. Bauernfeld leads  me to hope that you will not refuse me. Permit me to think that  he is not mistaken, and allow me to express once more my high  esteem and admiration.    F. Liszt    Tuesday Morning. [1846?]        49. To Franz von Schober, Coucillor of Legation in Weimar    Prague, April 11th, 1846. [According to the postal stamp.]    Dear Friend,    Your commissions have been attended to. The Wartburg has been  sent through Bauernfeld to the Allgemeine, and will, I trust, not  have to warten [Wait; a play on the words Wartburg and warten. A  treatise on the proposed completion of the Wartburg.] too long. I  have sent a second copy of this article to Paris, where it is to  appear in French garb. The report figures already in the Vienna  Theater-Zeitung, a paper with a wide circulation (and none the  better on that account!), where it makes quite a good appearance.    You would get the best connection with Frankfort through O. L. B.  Wolff (and through his medium, which is at any rate an honest and  proper one, with the German Frankfurtes Journal, or the  Oberpostamts-Zeitung, and even with the Didaskalia).    Talk this over with Wolff!    The same with the \"illustrated\" Leipzig Journal, in which the  article on the Wartburg should appear as soon as possible with an  illustration. Wolff can also arrange that, and in case it were  necessary, why, in Heaven's name, the sketch can be paid for. The  State of Weimar will not be ruined by it. Pereat Philistia and  its powerless foolery!!!    You have only to write a line to Brockhaus, and the columns of  the Deutsche Allgemeine stand open to you. Your personal and  official position in Weimar entitle you to this. Later on, in  passing through Leipzig, you can very easily consolidate this  connection. My stay in Hungary (Pest) will probably be limited to  the first half of May. I shall in any case see Schwab.  \"Sardanapalus\" [An opera planned by Liszt] (Italian) will most  probably be produced next season (May) in Vienna.    My stay in Weimar this summer...?? [The continuation of the  letter is missing.]    50. To Franz von Schober, Councillor of Legation in Weimar    Castle Gratz (at Prince Lichnowsky's)    May 28th, 1846    You are curious people at Weimar. You stride on towards a  possibility, and as soon as the thing is well in train you take  fright at it! However that may be, here are the instructions I  have received from Paris, and if you still wish an article on the  Wartburg to appear in a French paper you must conform to them,  and therefore send to my mother's address (20, Rue Louis le  Grand) the indispensable little notice.    The note from my Paris correspondent is as follows:--    \"The article in its present form would not be suitable for  publication in any French paper; it will be necessary to write  another, explaining in a few words in what and how the Wartburg  is historically interesting to Europe, and why Europe ought to  interest herself in its restoration; then make a short  architectural description of the"]]]
