[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3422"],[0,"The Life of the Fly; With Which are Interspersed Some Chapters of Autobiography (#13)"],[1,"n, revealing a new vein of observation to the entomologist,  the Anthrax flies, in the larval state, assume two successive shapes,  differing greatly one from the other, both in structure and in the part  which they are called upon to play. I will describe this double stage of  the organism by the phrase 'larval dimorphism.' The initial form, that  issuing from the egg, I will call 'the primary larva;' the second form  shall be 'the secondary larva.' Among the Anthrax flies, the function  of the primary larva is to reach the provisions, on which the mother  is unable to lay her egg. It is capable of moving and endowed with  ambulatory bristles, which allow the slim creature to glide through the  smallest interstices in the wall of a Bee's nest, to slip through the  woof of the cocoon and to make its way to the larva intended for its  successor's food. When this object is attained, its part is played.  Then appears the secondary larva, deprived of any means of progression.  Relegated to the inside of the invaded cell, as incapable of leaving  it by its own efforts as it was of entering, this one has no mission in  life but that of eating. It is a stomach that loads itself, digests and  goes on adding to its reserves. Next comes the pupa, armed for the  exit even as the primary larva was equipped for entering. When the  deliverance is accomplished, the perfect insect appears, busy with its  laying. The Anthrax cycle is thus divided into four periods, each of  which corresponds with special forms and functions. The primary larva  enters the casket containing provisions; the secondary larva consumes  these provisions; the pupa brings the insect to light by boring through  the enclosing wall; the perfect insect strews its eggs; and the cycle  starts afresh.          CHAPTER V. HEREDITY    Facts which I have set forth elsewhere prove that certain dung beetles'  make an exception to the rule of paternal indifference--a general rule  in the insect world--and know something of domestic cooperation. The  father works with almost the same zeal as the mother in providing for  the settlement of the family. Whence do these favored ones derive a gift  that borders on morality?    One might suggest the cost of installing the youngsters. Once they have  to be furnished with a lodging and to be left the wherewithal to live,  is it not an advantage, in the interests of the race, that the father  should come to the mother's assistance? Work divided between the two  will ensure the comfort which solitary work, its strength overtaxed,  would deny. This seems excellent reasoning; but it is much more often  contradicted than confirmed by the facts. Why is the Sisyphus a hard  working paterfamilias and the sacred beetle an idle vagabond? And yet  the two pill rollers practice the same industry and the same method  of rearing their young. Why does the Lunary Copris know what his near  kinsman, the Spanish Copris, does not? The first assists his mate, never  forsakes her. The second seeks a divorce at an early stage and leaves  the nuptial roof before the children's rations are massed and kneaded  into shape. Nevertheless, on both sides, there is the same big outlay  on a cellarful of egg-shaped pills, whose neat rows call for long and  watchful supervision. The similarity of the produce leads one to believe  in similarity of manners; and this is a mistake.    Let us turn elsewhere, to the wasps and bees, who unquestionably come  first in the laying up of a heritage for their offspring. Whether the  treasure hoarded for the benefit of the sons be a pot of honey or a bag  of game, the father never takes the smallest part in the work. He does  not so much as give a sweep of the broom when it comes to tidying the  outside of the dwelling. To do nothing is his invariable rule. The  bringing up of the family, therefore, however expensive it may be in  certain cases, has not given rise to the instinct of paternity. Then  where are we to look for a reply?    Let us make the question a wider one. Let us leave the animal, for a  moment, and occupy ourselves with man. We have our own instincts, some  of which take the name of genius when they attain a degree of might  that towers over the plain of mediocrity. We are amazed by the unusual,  springing out of flat commonplaces; we are spellbound by the luminous  speck shining in the wonted darkness. We admire; and, failing to  understand whence came those glorious harvests in this one or in that,  we say of them: \"They have the gift.\"    A goatherd amuses himself by making combinations with heaps of little  pebbles. He becomes an astoundingly quick and accurate reckoner without  other aid than a moment's reflection. He terrifies us with the conflict  of enormous numbers which blend in an orderly fashion in his mind, but  whose mere statement overwhelms us by its inextricable confusion. This  marvelous arithmetical juggler has an instinct, a genius, a gift for  figures.    A second, at the age when most of us delight in tops and marbles, leaves  the company of his boisterous playmates and listens to the echo of  celestial harps singing within him. His head is a cathedral filled with  the strains of an imaginary organ. Rich cadences, a secret concert heard  by him and him alone, steep him in ecstasy. All hail to that predestined  one who, some day, will rouse our noblest emotions with his musical  chords. He has an instinct, a genius, a gift for sounds.    A third, a brat who cannot yet eat his bread and jam without smearing  his face all over, takes a delight in fashioning clay into little  figures that are astonishingly lifelike for all their artless  awkwardness. He takes a knife and makes the briar root grin into all  sorts of entertaining masks; he carves boxwood in the semblance of a  horse or sheep; he engraves the effigy of his dog on sandstone. Leave  him alone; and, if Heaven second his efforts, he may become a famous  sculptor. He has an instinct, a gift, a genius for form.    And so with others in every branch of human activity: art and science,  industry and commerce, literature and philosophy. We have within us,  from the start, that which will distinguish us from the vulgar herd.  Now to what do we owe this distinctive character? To some throwback of  atavism, men tell us. Heredity, direct in one case, remote in another,  hands it down to us, increased or modified by time. Search the records  of the family and you will discover the source of the genius, a mere  trickle at first, then a stream, then a mighty river.    The darkness that lies behind that word heredity! Metaphysical science  has tried to throw a little light upon it and has succeeded only in  making unto itself a barbarous jargon, leaving obscurity more obscure  than before. As for us, who hunger after lucidity, let us relinquish  abstruse theories to whoever delights in them and confine our ambition  to observable facts, without pretending to explain the quackery of  the plasma. Our method certainly will not reveal to us the origin of  instinct; but it will at least show us where it would be waste of time  to look for it.    In this sort of research, a subject known through and through, down to  its most intimate peculiarities, is indispensable. Where shall we find  that subject? There would be a host of them and magnificent ones, if it  were possible to read the sealed pages of others' lives; but no one can  sound an existence outside his own and even then he can think himself  lucky if a retentive memory and the habit of reflection give his  soundings the proper accuracy. As none of us is able to project himself  into another's skin, we must needs, in considering this problem, remain  inside our own.    To talk about one's self is hateful, I know. The reader must have the  kindness to excuse me for the sake of the study in hand. I shall take  the silent beetle's place in the witness box, cross-examining myself  in all simplicity of soul, as I do the animal, and asking myself whence  that one of my instincts which stands out above the others is derived.      Since Darwin bestowed upon me the title of 'incomparable observer,' the  epithet has often come back to me, from this side and from that, without  my yet understanding what particular merit I have shown. It seems to me  so natural, so much within everybody's scope, so absorbing to interest  one's self in everything that swarms around us! However, let us pass on  and admit that the compliment is not unfounded.    My hesitation ceases if it is a question of admitting my curiosity in  matters that concern the insect. Yes, I possess the gift, the instinct  that impels me to frequent that singular world; yes, I know that I am  capable of spending on those studies an amount of precious time which  would be better employed in making provision, if possible, for the  poverty of old age; yes, I confess that I am an enthusiastic observer of  the animal. How was this characteristic propensity, at once the torment  and delight of my life, developed? And, to begin with, how much does it  owe to heredity?    The common people have no history: persecuted by the present, they  cannot think of preserving the memory of the past. And yet what  surpassingly instructive records, comforting too and pious, would be the  family papers that should tell us who our forebears were and speak to  us of their patient struggles with harsh fate, their stubborn efforts to  build up, atom by atom, what we are today. No story would come up with  that for individual interest. But by the very force of things the home  is abandoned; and, when the brood has flown, the nest is no longer  recognized.    I, a humble journeyman in the toilers' hive, am therefore very poor in  family recollections. In the second degree of ancestry, my facts become  suddenly obscured. I will linger over them a moment for two reasons:  first, to inquire into the influence of heredity; and, secondly, to  leave my children yet one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3424"],[0,"For the Term of His Natural Life (#13)"],[1,"  then Gabbett dashed round the partition.    \"It's Dawes!\" said the Moocher. \"We had forgotten him!\"    \"He'll join us, mate--he'll join us!\" cried Vetch, fearful of bloodshed.    Gabbett uttered a furious oath, and flinging himself on to the prostrate  figure, dragged it, head foremost, to the floor. The sudden vertigo  had saved Rufus Dawes's life. The robber twisted one brawny hand in his  shirt, and pressing the knuckles down, prepared to deliver a blow that  should for ever silence the listener, when Vetch caught his arm. \"He's  been asleep,\" he cried. \"Don't hit him! See, he's not awake yet.\"    A crowd gathered round. The giant relaxed his grip, but the convict gave  only a deep groan, and allowed his head to fall on his shoulder. \"You've  killed him!\" cried someone.    Gabbett took another look at the purpling face and the bedewed forehead,  and then sprang erect, rubbing at his right hand, as though he would rub  off something sticking there.    \"He's got the fever!\" he roared, with a terror-stricken grimace.    \"The what?\" asked twenty voices.    \"The fever, ye grinning fools!\" cried Gabbett. \"I've seen it before  to-day. The typhus is aboard, and he's the fourth man down!\"    The circle of beast-like faces, stretched forward to \"see the fight,\"  widened at the half-uncomprehended, ill-omened word. It was as though  a bombshell had fallen into the group. Rufus Dawes lay on the deck  motionless, breathing heavily. The savage circle glared at his prostrate  body. The alarm ran round, and all the prison crowded down to stare at  him. All at once he uttered a groan, and turning, propped his body on  his two rigid arms, and made an effort to speak. But no sound issued  from his convulsed jaws.    \"He's done,\" said the Moocher brutally. \"He didn't hear nuffin', I'll  pound it.\"    The noise of the heavy bolts shooting back broke the spell. The first  detachment were coming down from \"exercise.\" The door was flung back,  and the bayonets of the guard gleamed in a ray of sunshine that shot  down the hatchway. This glimpse of sunlight--sparkling at the entrance  of the foetid and stifling prison--seemed to mock their miseries. It was  as though Heaven laughed at them. By one of those terrible and strange  impulses which animate crowds, the mass, turning from the sick man,  leapt towards the doorway. The interior of the prison flashed white with  suddenly turned faces. The gloom scintillated with rapidly moving hands.  \"Air! air! Give us air!\"    \"That's it!\" said Sanders to his companions. \"I thought the news would  rouse 'em.\"    Gabbett--all the savage in his blood stirred by the sight of flashing  eyes and wrathful faces--would have thrown himself forward with the  rest, but Vetch plucked him back.    \"It'll be over in a moment,\" he said. \"It's only a fit they've got.\" He  spoke truly. Through the uproar was heard the rattle of iron on iron, as  the guard \"stood to their arms,\" and the wedge of grey cloth broke, in  sudden terror of the levelled muskets.    There was an instant's pause, and then old Pine walked, unmolested, down  the prison and knelt by the body of Rufus Dawes.    The sight of the familiar figure, so calmly performing its familiar  duty, restored all that submission to recognized authority which  strict discipline begets. The convicts slunk away into their berths,  or officiously ran to help \"the doctor,\" with affectation of intense  obedience. The prison was like a schoolroom, into which the master had  suddenly returned. \"Stand back, my lads! Take him up, two of you, and  carry him to the door. The poor fellow won't hurt you.\" His orders  were obeyed, and the old man, waiting until his patient had been safely  received outside, raised his hand to command attention. \"I see you know  what I have to tell. The fever has broken out. That man has got it. It  is absurd to suppose that no one else will be seized. I might catch it  myself. You are much crowded down here, I know; but, my lads, I can't  help that; I didn't make the ship, you know.\"    \"'Ear, 'ear!\"    \"It is a terrible thing, but you must keep orderly and quiet, and bear  it like men. You know what the discipline is, and it is not in my power  to alter it. I shall do my best for your comfort, and I look to you to  help me.\"    Holding his grey head very erect indeed, the brave old fellow passed  straight down the line, without looking to the right or left. He had  said just enough, and he reached the door amid a chorus of \"'Ear, 'ear!\"  \"Bravo!\" \"True for you, docther!\" and so on. But when he got fairly  outside, he breathed more freely. He had performed a ticklish task, and  he knew it.    \"'Ark at 'em,\" growled the Moocher from his corner, \"a-cheerin' at the  bloody noos!\"    \"Wait a bit,\" said the acuter intelligence of Jemmy Vetch. \"Give 'em  time. There'll be three or four more down afore night, and then we'll  see!\"          CHAPTER VIII. A DANGEROUS CRISIS.        It was late in the afternoon when Sarah Purfoy awoke from her uneasy  slumber. She had been dreaming of the deed she was about to do, and was  flushed and feverish; but, mindful of the consequences which hung upon  the success or failure of the enterprise, she rallied herself, bathed  her face and hands, and ascended with as calm an air as she could assume  to the poop-deck.    Nothing was changed since yesterday. The sentries' arms glittered in  the pitiless sunshine, the ship rolled and creaked on the swell of the  dreamy sea, and the prison-cage on the lower deck was crowded with the  same cheerless figures, disposed in the attitudes of the day before.  Even Mr. Maurice Frere, recovered from his midnight fatigues, was  lounging on the same coil of rope, in precisely the same position.    Yet the eye of an acute observer would have detected some difference  beneath this outward varnish of similarity. The man at the wheel  looked round the horizon more eagerly, and spit into the swirling,  unwholesome-looking water with a more dejected air than before. The  fishing-lines still hung dangling over the catheads, but nobody touched  them. The soldiers and sailors on the forecastle, collected in knots,  had no heart even to smoke, but gloomily stared at each other. Vickers  was in the cuddy writing; Blunt was in his cabin; and Pine, with two  carpenters at work under his directions, was improvising increased  hospital accommodation. The noise of mallet and hammer echoed in the  soldiers' berth ominously; the workmen might have been making coffins.  The prison was strangely silent, with the lowering silence which  precedes a thunderstorm; and the convicts on deck no longer told  stories, nor laughed at obscene jests, but sat together, moodily  patient, as if waiting for something. Three men--two prisoners and  a soldier--had succumbed since Rufus Dawes had been removed to the  hospital; and though as yet there had been no complaint or symptom  of panic, the face of each man, soldier, sailor, or prisoner, wore an  expectant look, as though he wondered whose turn would come next. On the  ship--rolling ceaselessly from side to side, like some wounded creature,  on the opaque profundity of that stagnant ocean--a horrible shadow had  fallen. The Malabar seemed to be enveloped in an electric cloud, whose  sullen gloom a chance spark might flash into a blaze that should consume  her.    The woman who held in her hands the two ends of the chain that would  produce this spark, paused, came up upon deck, and, after a glance  round, leant against the poop railing, and looked down into the  barricade. As we have said, the prisoners were in knots of four and  five, and to one group in particular her glance was directed. Three men,  leaning carelessly against the bulwarks, watched her every motion.    \"There she is, right enough,\" growled Mr. Gabbett, as if in continuation  of a previous remark. \"Flash as ever, and looking this way, too.\"    \"I don't see no wipe,\" said the practical Moocher.    \"Patience is a virtue, most noble knuckler!\" says the Crow, with  affected carelessness. \"Give the young woman time.\"    \"Blowed if I'm going to wait no longer,\" says the giant, licking his  coarse blue lips. \"'Ere we've been bluffed off day arter day, and kep'  dancin' round the Dandy's wench like a parcel o' dogs. The fever's  aboard, and we've got all ready. What's the use o' waitin'? Orfice, or  no orfice, I'm for bizness at once!--\"    \"--There, look at that,\" he added, with an oath, as the figure of  Maurice Frere appeared side by side with that of the waiting-maid, and  the two turned away up the deck together.    \"It's all right, you confounded muddlehead!\" cried the Crow, losing  patience with his perverse and stupid companion. \"How can she give us  the office with that cove at her elbow?\"    Gabbett's only reply to this question was a ferocious grunt, and a  sudden elevation of his clenched fist, which caused Mr. Vetch to retreat  precipitately. The giant did not follow; and Mr. Vetch, folding his  arms, and assuming an attitude of easy contempt, directed his attention  to Sarah Purfoy. She seemed an object of general attraction, for at the  same moment a young soldier ran up the ladder to the forecastle, and  eagerly bent his gaze in her direction.    Maurice Frere had come behind her and touched her on the shoulder. Since  their conversation the previous evening, he had made up his mind to be  fooled no longer. The girl was evidently playing with him, and he would  show her that he was not to be trifled with.    \"Well, Sarah!\"    \"Well, Mr. Frere,\" dropping her hand, and turning round with a smile.    \"How well you are looking to-day! Positively lovely!\"    \"You have told me that so often,\" says she, with a pout. \"Have you  nothing else to say?\"    \"Except that I love you.\" This in a most impassioned manner.    \"That is no news. I know you do.\"    \"Curse it, Sarah, what is a fellow to do?\" His profligacy was failing  him rapidly. \"What is the use of playing fast and loose with a "]]]
