Vulg.--_Manungal_, Tag., Pam., Bicol.; _Manunagl_, _Linatoganak_,  _Palagarium_, _Daraput_, Vis.    Uses.--The wood and seeds contain an intensely bitter principle. The  Filipinos make cups and vases of the wood and allow water to stand  in them 6-12 hours, thus preparing a solution of the bitter principle  of the plant which they use in various stomach disorders.    Vrij has extracted from the seeds a 33% oil of a bright yellow color,  composed, according to Oudermans, of 84 parts olein to 16 of palmitin  and stearin.    The bitter principle contained in the root, wood and bark was  discovered by Blunse who named it _samaderin_; it is a white,  crystalline, foliaceous substance, more soluble in water than  in alcohol, fusible. Nitric and hydrochloric acids color  it yellow. Sulphuric acid immediately forms a violet red  color which disappears as iridescent, feathery crystals are  precipitated. (D. Beaumentz et Egasse.)    The Filipino \"herb-doctors\" concoct an oil of manungal that in reality  contains none of the ingredients of the seeds; it is simply cocoanut  oil in which chips of the wood have been soaked. They use it in doses  of 30-60 grams as a purgative, externally as an application to the  abdomen in colic or indigestion and with friction in rheumatism or  contusions. In India the oil extracted from the seeds is used locally  with friction in rheumatism.    The decoction of the wood and the powdered wood are given in fevers,  in dyspepsia and as a general tonic.              Infusion.--Chips of the wood      20 grams.                     Water                 500 grams.      A wineglassful several times a day in cholera, fevers, diarrhoea, etc.    Botanical Description.--A small tree, trunk straight, the wood  white and very light in weight. Leaves 4-5' long, alternate, acute,  oval, entire, glabrous, coriaceous, veined. Petioles very short, no  stipules. Flowers in terminal umbels, each composed of 4-6 flowerets  with moderately long pedicels. Common peduncle, very slender, very  long, drooping. Calyx of same color as corolla, inferior, very  small, 4-lobuled. Corolla purplish, very long, 4 straight, linear  petals. Stamens 8, inserted on the receptacle. Filaments of equal  length with the petals, with 1-2 appendices at the base. Anthers  spiral. Ovary 5-lobuled, borne on small stalk. One style of equal  length with the stamens, situated above the center of the 5 lobules  of the ovary which develop into 5 future pods. Stigma simple. Fruit  5 woody pods, short, united centrally above a small base, semi-lunar  in form, medianly expanded, venate, containing a small wrinkled,  kidney-shaped seed attached by a seed-stalk to the superior suture.    Habitat.--Very common and well known everywhere in the  Philippines. Blooms in February.          BURSERACEÆ.    Myrrh Family.        _Garuga pinnata_, Roxb. (_G. Madagascarensis_, DC.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Bugo_, Tag.    Uses.--The fruit is slightly acid and edible. The trunk exudes an  abundant gum, of the odor of turpentine, translucent, greenish-yellow,  forming small masses slightly soluble in alcohol, soluble in water,  with which a mucilage is formed. The juice of the leaves is used  for asthma. The sap is used in Bombay to remove opacities of the  cornea. There is another species in the Philippines, _G. floribunda_,  Decsne (_Icica Abilo_, Blanco), _abilo_, Tag., the root of which  furnishes a decoction used for phthisis. This species also produces  a gum-resin similar to that of the _bugo_.    Botanical Description.--A tree, with leaves alternate, odd-pinnate,  without stipules, bunched on the ends of the branches, with opposite,  serrate leaflets. Flowers yellowish-white in panicles, compound,  polygamous. Calyx bell-shaped, 5-toothed. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens  10, free, in 2 series. Ovary inferior, 5-lobuled. Fruit, a globose,  greenish-yellow drupe with numerous bony seeds.    Habitat.--Everywhere in Luzon, Panay and Balabac.        _Canarium commune_, L. (_C. album_ and _C. Luzonicum_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Pili_, Tag.; _Java Almond Tree_, _East Indian Elemi_, Eng.    Uses.--The ripe pili nut is edible and sold in confectioneries. It  yields a fixed oil, an excellent sample of which was sent by the  Manila pharmacist D. A. del Rosario to the Paris Exposition of  1889. \"It is an oil very similar to oil of almond and owing to its  physical properties may be used as a substitute for the latter for  all the requirements of pharmacy. The only inconvenience connected  with its use is the slight one that it solidifies at 3° C. It could  furthermore be very advantageously used in the manufacture of fine  grades of soap.\" (D. A. del Rosario.)    The incised trunk exudes a gum-resin called _brea blanca_ (white  pitch) in the Philippines and _elemi_ in Europe. Until recently it  was not known in Europe what tree yielded the gum elemi, some authors  stating that according to Blanco it was the resin of the _Icica abilo_,  Blanco (_Garuga floribunda_, Decsne); it is not true, however, that  Padre Blanco ever attributed such origin to that product or named his  Icica the \"pitch-tree.\" On the contrary in speaking of the Canarium,  Blanco states that it yields a resin called \"pili-pitch.\" I do not  know the reason for this confusion of terms, but presume it to be  due to imperfect knowledge of Spanish on the part of those who thus  quote Blanco.    Pili-pitch, or elemi, as they call it in Manila, is a substance  existing in soft masses, slightly yellowish or gray, resembling old  honey in appearance. Its odor is strong and agreeable, somewhat like  that of lemon and turpentine. Its taste is acrid and bitter.    The French pharmacist Meaujean demonstrated in 1820 that elemi contains  two resins, one soluble in the cold, and the other in hot spirits of  wine. Other chemists, among them Baup, Flückiger and Hanbury, have  found elemi to be composed of a resinous substance and a colorless  essential oil; the proportion of the latter Flückiger gives as 10%  and further states that it is dextrogyrous. Sainte-Claire Deville found  the essential oil levogyrous, a fact that emphasizes the probability of  there being different products in the market bearing the name of elemi.    Baup obtained several principles from it: (1) A resin, _brein_,  fusible at 187°, soluble in cold alcohol, crystallizable in oblique  rhombic prisms; (2) another crystalline substance, _bryoidin_, soluble  in 360 parts water at 10°, and melting at 13°; (3) a small amount of  _breidin_, a body soluble in 260 parts water and melting at 100°+;  (4) another resin soluble in boiling alcohol, called _amyrin_.    White pitch is used in the Philippines to make plasters which they  apply to the back and breast of patients suffering from bronchial  or pulmonary complaints; it is also applied to indolent ulcers. We  believe that elemi possesses the same properties as copaiba, and that  its indications for internal use are the same.    Botanical Description.--A tree 30-40 meters high, with leaves  alternate, odd-pinnate; leaflets opposite, coriaceous. Flowers  yellowish-white in axillary, compound panicles, hermaphrodite. Calyx  3-toothed. Corolla, 3 oblong, concave petals. Stamens 6, inserted  on the base of the disc. Ovary free, of 3 lobules each containing 2  ovules. Style simple. Stigma, 3 lobules. Drupe oblong, size of large  prune, fleshy, containing a hard, 3-sided pit.    Habitat.--Very common in all Philippine woods especially in Camarines.          MELIACEÆ.    Melia Family.        _Melia Azedarach_, L.    Nom. Vulg.--_Paraiso_ (_Paradise_), Sp.-Fil.; _Pride of India_,  _China Tree_, Eng.    Uses.--The root was official in the U. S. P., 1880, as an anthelmintic;  it is administered in the following form:              Fresh root bark      120 grams.          Water                  1 liter.      Boil till reduced one half.    Dose.--For a child 1 soup-spoonful every 15 minutes till nausea  is produced.    In view of the narcotic effects produced by this drug, the foregoing  method of administration seems to us imprudent; we prefer to give 30-70  grams of the decoction and follow with a purgative such as castor oil.    This drug is also tonic, febrifuge and astringent, and a decoction  of its leaves and flowers is used as a wash for ulcers. Some believe  that the leaves and fruit contain toxic principles, which may well be  true considering the effects of large doses of their preparations. It  has also been observed that the bark collected in March and April may  cause dilatation of the pupil, stupor, etc.; this may be explained  by the fact that at this season the sap is rising in the tree and  the bark contains an increased amount of active ingredients.    The fruit yields a fixed oil, and by fermentation and distillation  produces alcohol.    The root bark referred to is bitter and nauseous, if taken from the  superficial roots--the part usually employed; the bark of the deeper  parts is astringent by virtue of the contained tannin.    Jacobs analyzed the bark and isolated an amorphous resin of yellowish  color and very bitter taste. It is soluble in alcohol, ether and  chloroform, slightly soluble in sulphuret of carbon, insoluble in  turpentine or benzin. He believes that it is the active principle of  the root, and produces the anthelmintic action already mentioned:  the proper dose is 0.20 centigrams to a child of 4 years, followed  by a purge of calomel.

It is your party.\"    \"Please, I'd rather stop here with you.\"    \"No, I agree,\" said Miss Lavish. \"It's like a school feast; the boys  have got separated from the girls. Miss Lucy, you are to go. We wish to  converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.\"    The girl was stubborn. As her time at Florence drew to its close she was  only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent. Such a one was  Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte. She wished she had  not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her remark  and seemed determined to get rid of her.    \"How tired one gets,\" said Miss Bartlett. \"Oh, I do wish Freddy and your  mother could be here.\"    Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of  enthusiasm. Lucy did not look at the view either. She would not enjoy  anything till she was safe at Rome.    \"Then sit you down,\" said Miss Lavish. \"Observe my foresight.\"    With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that  protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.  She sat on one; who was to sit on the other?    \"Lucy; without a moment's doubt, Lucy. The ground will do for me. Really  I have not had rheumatism for years. If I do feel it coming on I shall  stand. Imagine your mother's feelings if I let you sit in the wet  in your white linen.\" She sat down heavily where the ground looked  particularly moist. \"Here we are, all settled delightfully. Even if my  dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown. Sit down, dear;  you are too unselfish; you don't assert yourself enough.\" She cleared  her throat. \"Now don't be alarmed; this isn't a cold. It's the tiniest  cough, and I have had it three days. It's nothing to do with sitting  here at all.\"    There was only one way of treating the situation. At the end of five  minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr. Eager, vanquished  by the mackintosh square.    She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the  carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars. The miscreant, a bony  young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the courtesy  of a host and the assurance of a relative.    \"Dove?\" said Lucy, after much anxious thought.    His face lit up. Of course he knew where. Not so far either. His arm  swept three-fourths of the horizon. He should just think he did know  where. He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them  towards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.    More seemed necessary. What was the Italian for \"clergyman\"?    \"Dove buoni uomini?\" said she at last.    Good? Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings! He showed her his  cigar.    \"Uno--piu--piccolo,\" was her next remark, implying \"Has the cigar been  given to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?\"    She was correct as usual. He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to make  it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded his  hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of a  minute was ready to conduct her. Italians are born knowing the way. It  would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a  chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well  as the squares. Any one can find places, but the finding of people is a  gift from God.    He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets. She thanked  him with real pleasure. In the company of this common man the world  was beautiful and direct. For the first time she felt the influence  of Spring. His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other  things, existed in great profusion there; \"would she like to see them?\"    \"Ma buoni uomini.\"    He bowed. Certainly. Good men first, violets afterwards. They proceeded  briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker. They  were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing round  them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless  pieces. He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the pliant  boughs. She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness. Not a step, not a  twig, was unimportant to her.    \"What is that?\"    There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them. The voice  of Mr. Eager? He shrugged his shoulders. An Italian's ignorance is  sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge. She could not make him  understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen. The view was  forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other  hills.    \"Eccolo!\" he exclaimed.    At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of  the wood. Light and beauty enveloped her. She had fallen on to a little  open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.    \"Courage!\" cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.  \"Courage and love.\"    She did not answer. From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view,  and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating  the hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into  pools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam. But  never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the well-head,  the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth.    Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.  But he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.    George had turned at the sound of her arrival. For a moment he  contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven. He saw radiant  joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue  waves. The bushes above them closed. He stepped quickly forward and  kissed her.    Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called,  \"Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!\" The silence of life had been broken by Miss Bartlett  who stood brown against the view.        Chapter VII: They Return    Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the  afternoon. What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy  was slow to discover. Mr. Eager had met them with a questioning eye.  Charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk. Mr. Emerson, seeking  his son, was told whereabouts to find him. Mr. Beebe, who wore the  heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the  return home. There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment. Pan  had been amongst them--not the great god Pan, who has been buried these  two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social  contretemps and unsuccessful picnics. Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and  had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a  pleasant surprise. Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett. Lucy had lost Mr.  Eager. Mr. Emerson had lost George. Miss Bartlett had lost a mackintosh  square. Phaethon had lost the game.    That last fact was undeniable. He climbed on to the box shivering, with  his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather. \"Let us go  immediately,\" he told them. \"The signorino will walk.\"    \"All the way? He will be hours,\" said Mr. Beebe.    \"Apparently. I told him it was unwise.\" He would look no one in the  face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him. He alone had  played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others  had used scraps of their intelligence. He alone had divined what things  were, and what he wished them to be. He alone had interpreted the  message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a  dying man. Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave--she could  interpret it also. Not so these English. They gain knowledge slowly, and  perhaps too late.    The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of  his employers. He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett's opponents,  but infinitely the least dangerous. Once back in the town, he and his  insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more. Of  course, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the  bushes; he might make a tavern story out of it. But after all, what have  we to do with taverns? Real menace belongs to the drawing-room. It  was of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed  downwards towards the fading sun. Lucy sat beside her; Mr. Eager sat  opposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious. They spoke  of Alessio Baldovinetti.    Rain and darkness came on together. The two ladies huddled together  under an inadequate parasol. There was a lightning flash, and Miss  Lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front. At the next  flash, Lucy screamed also. Mr. Eager addressed her professionally:    \"Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith. If I might say so, there  is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements. Are we  seriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical  display, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?\"    \"No--of course--\"    \"Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being  struck are enormous. The steel knives, the only articles which might  attract the current, are in the other carriage. And, in any case, we are  infinitely safer than if we were walking. Courage--courage and faith.\"    Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin's hand. At  times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care  not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it  afterwards. Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles,  gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross  examination.    She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.    \"Mr. Eager!\" called Mr. Beebe. \"We want"]]]
