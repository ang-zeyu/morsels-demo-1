It was assumed as self-evident,  until Cantor and Dedekind established the opposite, that if, from any  collection of things, some were taken away, the number of things left  must always be less than the original number of things. This  assumption, as a matter of fact, holds only of finite collections; and  the rejection of it, where the infinite is concerned, has been shown  to remove all the difficulties that had hitherto baffled human reason  in this matter, and to render possible the creation of an exact  science of the infinite. This stupendous fact ought to produce a  revolution in the higher teaching of mathematics; it has itself added  immeasurably to the educational value of the subject, and it has at  last given the means of treating with logical precision many studies  which, until lately, were wrapped in fallacy and obscurity. By those  who were educated on the old lines, the new work is considered to be  appallingly difficult, abstruse, and obscure; and it must be confessed  that the discoverer, as is so often the case, has hardly himself  emerged from the mists which the light of his intellect is dispelling.  But inherently, the new doctrine of the infinite, to all candid and  inquiring minds, has facilitated the mastery of higher mathematics;  for hitherto, it has been necessary to learn, by a long process of  sophistication, to give assent to arguments which, on first  acquaintance, were rightly judged to be confused and erroneous. So far  from producing a fearless belief in reason, a bold rejection of  whatever failed to fulfil the strictest requirements of logic, a  mathematical training, during the past two centuries, encouraged the  belief that many things, which a rigid inquiry would reject as  fallacious, must yet be accepted because they work in what the  mathematician calls \"practice.\" By this means, a timid, compromising  spirit, or else a sacerdotal belief in mysteries not intelligible to  the profane, has been bred where reason alone should have ruled. All  this it is now time to sweep away; let those who wish to penetrate  into the arcana of mathematics be taught at once the true theory in  all its logical purity, and in the concatenation established by the  very essence of the entities concerned.    If we are considering mathematics as an end in itself, and not as a  technical training for engineers, it is very desirable to preserve the  purity and strictness of its reasoning. Accordingly those who have  attained a sufficient familiarity with its easier portions should be  led backward from propositions to which they have assented as  self-evident to more and more fundamental principles from which what  had previously appeared as premises can be deduced. They should be  taught--what the theory of infinity very aptly illustrates--that many  propositions seem self-evident to the untrained mind which,  nevertheless, a nearer scrutiny shows to be false. By this means they  will be led to a sceptical inquiry into first principles, an  examination of the foundations upon which the whole edifice of  reasoning is built, or, to take perhaps a more fitting metaphor, the  great trunk from which the spreading branches spring. At this stage,  it is well to study afresh the elementary portions of mathematics,  asking no longer merely whether a given proposition is true, but also  how it grows out of the central principles of logic. Questions of this  nature can now be answered with a precision and certainty which were  formerly quite impossible; and in the chains of reasoning that the  answer requires the unity of all mathematical studies at last unfolds  itself.    In the great majority of mathematical text-books there is a total lack  of unity in method and of systematic development of a central theme.  Propositions of very diverse kinds are proved by whatever means are  thought most easily intelligible, and much space is devoted to mere  curiosities which in no way contribute to the main argument. But in  the greatest works, unity and inevitability are felt as in the  unfolding of a drama; in the premisses a subject is proposed for  consideration, and in every subsequent step some definite advance is  made towards mastery of its nature. The love of system, of  interconnection, which is perhaps the inmost essence of the  intellectual impulse, can find free play in mathematics as nowhere  else. The learner who feels this impulse must not be repelled by an  array of meaningless examples or distracted by amusing oddities, but  must be encouraged to dwell upon central principles, to become  familiar with the structure of the various subjects which are put  before him, to travel easily over the steps of the more important  deductions. In this way a good tone of mind is cultivated, and  selective attention is taught to dwell by preference upon what is  weighty and essential.    When the separate studies into which mathematics is divided have each  been viewed as a logical whole, as a natural growth from the  propositions which constitute their principles, the learner will be  able to understand the fundamental science which unifies and  systematises the whole of deductive reasoning. This is symbolic  logic--a study which, though it owes its inception to Aristotle, is  yet, in its wider developments, a product, almost wholly, of the  nineteenth century, and is indeed, in the present day, still growing  with great rapidity. The true method of discovery in symbolic logic,  and probably also the best method for introducing the study to a  learner acquainted with other parts of mathematics, is the analysis of  actual examples of deductive reasoning, with a view to the discovery  of the principles employed. These principles, for the most part, are  so embedded in our ratiocinative instincts, that they are employed  quite unconsciously, and can be dragged to light only by much patient  effort. But when at last they have been found, they are seen to be few  in number, and to be the sole source of everything in pure  mathematics. The discovery that all mathematics follows inevitably  from a small collection of fundamental laws is one which immeasurably  enhances the intellectual beauty of the whole; to those who have been  oppressed by the fragmentary and incomplete nature of most existing  chains of deduction this discovery comes with all the overwhelming  force of a revelation; like a palace emerging from the autumn mist as  the traveller ascends an Italian hill-side, the stately storeys of the  mathematical edifice appear in their due order and proportion, with a  new perfection in every part.    Until symbolic logic had acquired its present development, the  principles upon which mathematics depends were always supposed to be  philosophical, and discoverable only by the uncertain, unprogressive  methods hitherto employed by philosophers. So long as this was  thought, mathematics seemed to be not autonomous, but dependent upon a  study which had quite other methods than its own. Moreover, since the  nature of the postulates from which arithmetic, analysis, and geometry  are to be deduced was wrapped in all the traditional obscurities of  metaphysical discussion, the edifice built upon such dubious  foundations began to be viewed as no better than a castle in the air.  In this respect, the discovery that the true principles are as much a  part of mathematics as any of their consequences has very greatly  increased the intellectual satisfaction to be obtained. This  satisfaction ought not to be refused to learners capable of enjoying  it, for it is of a kind to increase our respect for human powers and  our knowledge of the beauties belonging to the abstract world.    Philosophers have commonly held that the laws of logic, which underlie  mathematics, are laws of thought, laws regulating the operations of  our minds. By this opinion the true dignity of reason is very greatly  lowered: it ceases to be an investigation into the very heart and  immutable essence of all things actual and possible, becoming,  instead, an inquiry into something more or less human and subject to  our limitations. The contemplation of what is non-human, the discovery  that our minds are capable of dealing with material not created by  them, above all, the realisation that beauty belongs to the outer  world as to the inner, are the chief means of overcoming the terrible  sense of impotence, of weakness, of exile amid hostile powers, which  is too apt to result from acknowledging the all-but omnipotence of  alien forces. To reconcile us, by the exhibition of its awful beauty,  to the reign of Fate--which is merely the literary personification of  these forces--is the task of tragedy. But mathematics takes us still  further from what is human, into the region of absolute necessity, to  which not only the actual world, but every possible world, must  conform; and even here it builds a habitation, or rather finds a  habitation eternally standing, where our ideals are fully satisfied  and our best hopes are not thwarted. It is only when we thoroughly  understand the entire independence of ourselves, which belongs to this  world that reason finds, that we can adequately realise the profound  importance of its beauty.    Not only is mathematics independent of us and our thoughts, but in  another sense we and the whole universe of existing things are  independent of mathematics. The apprehension of this purely ideal  character is indispensable, if we are to understand rightly the place  of mathematics as one among the arts. It was formerly supposed that  pure reason could decide, in some respects, as to the nature of the  actual world: geometry, at least, was thought to deal with the space  in which we live. But we now know that pure mathematics can never  pronounce upon questions of actual existence: the world of reason, in  a sense, controls the world of fact, but it is not at any point  creative"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25449"],[0,"The Young Castellan: A Tale of the English Civil War (#13)"],[1,"fortably, for the man's words as to the future did not sound  pleasant.    \"Ay, and I shall take it away from 'em, sir; for if the worst comes to  the worst, I shall have made all my plans before, and I'll do a bit o'  Guy Fawkesing.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Why, I should ha' thought you'd ha' understood that, sir.\"    \"Of course I do; but how could you blow up the castle?\"    \"By laying a train to the powder-magazine, knocking the heads out of a  couple o' kegs, and then up it goes.\"    \"Powder--magazine--kegs?\" cried Roy.  \"Why, we haven't one, and I wanted  to talk to you about getting some.  How's it to be done?\"    \"By going to your father's lib'ry, sir, and opening the little drawer as  he keeps locked up in the big oak table.  There's the keys there.\"    \"Yes, of the wine-cellars, Ben; but no--Oh, absurd!\"    \"Is it, my lad?  I think not.  Think it's likely as your grandfather and  his father would have had swords and pikes and armour, and big guns and  little guns, and not had no powder to load 'em with?\"    \"Well, it doesn't sound likely, Ben; but I'm sure we have none here.\"    \"Well, sir, begging your pardon for contradicting my master, I'm sure as  we have.\"    \"Down in the cellars?\"    \"Down in one of 'em, sir.\"    \"But I never knew.\"    \"Perhaps not, sir; but I've been down there with your father, and I  don't suppose it's a thing he'd talk about.  Anyhow, there it is, shut  up behind three doors, and I'll be bound to say dry as a bone.  It's  very old, but good enough, may be.  All the same, though, Master Roy,  the sooner we try what it's like the better, and if you'll take my  advice you'll have one of the big guns loaded and fired with a good  round charge.  That'll try the gun, scale it out, and give 'em a hint  for miles round that, though Sir Granby's gone to the wars, his son's at  home, and his dame too, and that they don't mean to stand any nonsense  from a set o' crop-eared rascals.  That'll do more good, Master Roy,  than a deal o' talking, and be less trouble.\"    \"We must do it at once, Ben,\" said Roy, decidedly.    \"The first thing, sir; and, by the way, as we're going to begin to get  our garrison together, it'll be as well to make a little show.  If I was  you, I'd put on a pair of buff boots, wear a sword and a sash always,  and I don't say put on a lot of armour, but if you'll let me, I'll take  the gorget off that suit of Italian armour, and you can wear that.\"    \"But it will look so--\" said Roy, flushing.    \"Yes, sir; but we've got to look so,\" said the old soldier, decidedly.  \"It makes people respect you; and if you'll be good enough to give me my  orders, I'll take to a buff coat and steel cap at once.\"    \"Very well, do so,\" said Roy.  \"But I will not promise to make any show  myself.\"    \"But you must, sir, please, for her ladyship's sake.  Look here, Master  Roy, you'll be calling the tenants and labourers together, and you'll  have to make them a speech.\"    \"Shall I?\" said Roy, nervously.    \"Why, of course, sir, telling 'em what their duty is, and calling upon  'em to fight for their king, their country, and their homes.  Yes,  that's it, sir; that's just what you've got to say.\"    \"Well, Ben, if I must, I must.\"    \"Then must it is, sir; but if they come here to the castle, and you're  like you are now, they'll be only half warmed up, and say that Master  Roy can talk, and some of 'em'll sneer and snigger; but if you come out  when they're all here, looking like your father's son in a cavalier hat  and feathers, with the gorget on, and the king's colours for a sash, ay,  and buff boots and spurs--\"    \"Oh, no, not spurs when I'm walking,\" protested Roy.    \"Yes, sir, spurs,--a big pair with gilt rowels, as'll _clink-clink_ with  every step you take; they'll set up a cheer, and swear to fight for you,  when you've done, to the death.  And look here, Master Roy, when you've  done speaking, you just wave your hat, and chuck it up in the air, as if  fine felts and ostridge feathers weren't nothing to you, who called upon  'em all to fight for the king.\"    Roy drew a deep sigh, for his follower's words had nearly made him  breathless.    \"We shall see,\" he sighed.    \"Yes, sir, we shall see,\" cried Ben.  \"So now, if you please, sir, I  won't wait to be getting into my buff jerkin now, but I'll take your  orders for what we're to do first.\"    \"Yes, Ben; what ought we to do first?\"    \"Well, sir, it's you as know.  You said something about strengthening  the guard at the gate.\"    \"Oh, but I say, Ben, that was you said so.\"    \"Only as your mouthpiece, sir.\"    \"But it sounds silly to talk about strengthening the guard at the gate  when we've only got old Jenk, and no regular sentry to put there.\"    \"Never you mind about how it sounds, sir, so long as it's sense,\" cried  Ben, striking his fist into his left palm.  \"We've got to make our  garrison and our sentries out of the raw stuff, and the sooner we begin  to sound silly now the better.  It won't be silly for any one who comes  and finds a staunch man there, who would sooner send a musketoon bullet  through him than let him pass.\"    \"No, Ben, it will not, certainly.  Whom shall I send?\"    \"Well, sir, if I was you, I'd do it as I meant to go on.  You give me my  orders, and I'll go and enlist Sam Rogers in the stable at once, bring  him here fierce-like into the armoury; put him on a buff coat, buckle on  a sword, and give him his bandoleer and firelock, and march him down  with sword drawn to relieve guard with old Jenk.\"    \"But he'll be cleaning the troopers' horses, and begin to laugh.\"    \"Sam Rogers, sir?  Not him.  He'll come like a lamb; and when I marches  him down to the gate, he'll go out like a lion, holding his head up with  the steel cap on, and be hoping that all the servant-girls and the cook  are watching him.  Don't you be afraid of him laughing.  All I'm afraid  of is, that while he's so fresh he'll be playing up some games with his  firelock, and mocking poor old Jenk.\"    \"Pray, warn him, then.\"    \"You trust me, sir.  Then, when that's done, perhaps you'll give the  orders to find quarters for our new men, and tell 'em that they're to  rest till to-morrow by your orders; and after that there's the  drawbridge and portcullis.\"    \"Yes; what about them?\"    \"Why, sir, you know how they've been for years.  You must have 'em seen  to at once; and, if I was you, I'd have the portcullis seen to first,  and the little sally-port door in the corner of the tower.  We shall  want half a dozen men.  I'm a bit afraid of the old bars and rollers,  but we shall see.\"    \"Order the men to come, then, when you've done, and let us see, and get  everything right as soon as possible.\"    Ben saluted in military fashion, and marched off to the hall, where Roy  heard him speak in a cheering, authoritative voice to the new-comers,  and then came out to march across to the stables, which were in the  basement of the east side of the castle, with their entrance between the  building and the court; but the gate-way that had opened into the  court-yard had been partly closed up when that was turned into a  flower-garden, and the archway was now covered with ivy.    Roy went up to one of the corridors beneath the ramparts, and watched,  out of curiosity, to see how the groom would take his new orders.    He was not long kept in suspense, for the sturdy young fellow came out  talking eagerly with Ben and turning down his sleeves.  Then they went  inside, through the great gate-way to the armoury, and in an incredibly  short space of time came out together, the groom in steel jockey-shaped  cap with a spike on the top, buff coat, sword, and bandoleer, and  shouldering the clumsy firelock of the period.    As they reached the archway, Ben stopped short, drew his sword, said a  few words in a sharp tone, and marched off, with Sam Rogers keeping  step; while a muttering of voices told of how strangely matters had  turned out according to old Ben's prophecy, for, on turning to see what  it meant, Roy saw down through one of the narrow windows that the whole  of the household had turned out to do likewise.  But there was no  giggling and laughing, for the women seemed to be impressed, and the  men-servants were shaking their heads and talking together earnestly  about the evil times that had come.    Another sound made Roy turn sharply in the other direction to see his  mother approaching.    \"Then you have begun, my son,\" she said, gravely.    \"Yes, mother.  The sentry was set, after a long talk with Martlet.\"    \"You need not speak in that apologetic tone, my boy,\" said Lady Royland,  quietly.  \"I see the necessity, and I am sure you are doing well.  Now,  come and tell me more of your plans.\"    She led the way to the library, and as they entered Roy glanced towards  the big oak table standing at one end; his eyes fixed themselves upon  the small drawer, and he seemed to see a rusty old key lying there, one  whose wards were shaping themselves plainly before his eyes, as he told  of his arrangements with the old soldier.    \"Yes, you have begun well, Roy,\" said Lady Royland at last.  \"And what  Martlet says is quite true.\"    \"But you would not dress up as he advises, mother?\" protested Roy,  rather bashfully.    \"Dress up?  No, my boy; but I would put on such things as a cavalier and  an officer would wear under such circumstances,--a gorget, sword, boots,  hat and feathers, and the king's colours as a scarf.  Why, Roy, your  father would wear those in addition to his scarlet coat.\"    \"Yes, mother; but he is a soldier.\"    \"So are you now, Roy,\" said the dame, proudly.  \"And so must every man  be who loves his king and country.  Martlet is quite right, and I shall  prepare your scarf and feathers with my own hands.\"    \"Why, mother,\" cried the boy, wonderingly, \"how you have changed since  even a short time ago.\"    \"So has our position, Roy, my son,\" she said, firmly.  \"Who's there?\"    The butler entered.    \"Benj"]]]
