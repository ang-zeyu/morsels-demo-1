Economic    activity is strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa    conducts the great bulk of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna    processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with    canned tuna the primary export. Transfers from the US Government add    substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. According to    one observer, attempts by the government to develop a larger and    broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its    limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism, a    developing sector, may be held back by the current financial    difficulties in East Asia.    GDP: purchasing power parity--$150 million (1995 est.)

The good times were coming for Polly--coming pretty near, and she  didn't know it! All the children were in the secret; for as Mrs. Pepper  declared, \"They'd have to know it; and if they were let into the secret  they'd keep it better.\"    So they had individually and collectively been intrusted with the  precious secret, and charged with the extreme importance of \"never  letting any one know,\" and they had been nearly bursting ever since with  the wild desire to impart their knowledge.    \"I'm afraid I shall tell,\" said David, running to his mother at last;  \"oh, mammy, I don't dare stay near Polly, I do want to tell so bad.\"    \"Oh, no, you won't, David,\" said his mother encouragingly, \"when you  know mother don't want you to; and besides, think how Polly'll look when  she sees it.\"    \"I know,\" cried David in the greatest rapture, \"I wouldn't tell for all  the world! I guess she'll look nice, don't you mother?\" and he laughed  in glee at the thought.    \"Poor child! I guess she will!\" and then Mrs. Pepper laughed too, till  the little old kitchen rang with delight at the accustomed sound.    The children all had to play \"clap in and clap out\" in the bedroom while  it came; and \"stage coach,\" too--\"anything to make a noise,\" Ben said.  And then after they got nicely started in the game, he would be missing  to help about the mysterious thing in the kitchen, which was safe since  Polly couldn't see him go on account of her bandage. So she didn't  suspect in the least. And although the rest were almost dying to be  out in the kitchen, they conscientiously stuck to their bargain to keep  Polly occupied. Only Joel would open the door and peep once; and then  Phronsie behind him began. \"Oh, I see the sto----\" but David swooped  down on her in a twinkling, and smothered the rest by tickling her.    Once they came very near having the whole thing pop out. \"Whatever is  that noise in the kitchen?\" asked Polly, as they all stopped to  take breath after the scuffle of \"stage coach.\" \"It sounds just like  grating.\"    \"I'll go and see,\" cried Joel, promptly; and then he flew out where his  mother and Ben and two men were at work on a big, black thing in the  corner. The old stove, strange to say, was nowhere to be seen! Something  else stood in its place, a shiny, black affair, with a generous supply  of oven doors, and altogether such a comfortable, home-like look about  it, as if it would say--\"I'm going to make sunshine in this house!\"    \"Oh, Joel,\" cried his mother, turning around on him with very black  hands, \"you haven't told!\"    \"No,\" said Joel, \"but she's hearin' the noise, Polly is.\"    \"Hush!\" said Ben, to one of the men.    \"We can't put it up without some noise,\" the man replied, \"but we'll be  as still as we can.\"    \"Isn't it a big one, ma?\" asked Joel, in the loudest of stage whispers,  that Polly on the other side of the door couldn't have failed to hear if  Phronsie hadn't laughed just then.    \"Go back, Joe, do,\" said Ben, \"play tag--anything,\" he implored, \"we'll  be through in a few minutes.\"    \"It takes forever!\" said Joel, disappearing within the bedroom door.  Luckily for the secret, Phronsie just then ran a pin sticking up on the  arm of the old chair, into her finger; and Polly, while comforting her,  forgot to question Joel. And then the mother came in, and though she had  ill-concealed hilarity in her voice, she kept chattering and bustling  around with Polly's supper to such an extent that there was no chance  for a word to be got in.    Next morning it seemed as if the \"little brown house,\" would turn inside  out with joy.    \"Oh, mammy!\" cried Polly, jumping into her arms the first thing, as Dr.  Fisher untied the bandage, \"my eyes are new! just the same as if I'd  just got 'em! Don't they look different?\" she asked, earnestly, running  to the cracked glass to see for herself.    \"No,\" said Ben, \"I hope not; the same brown ones, Polly.\"    \"Well,\" said Polly, hugging first one and then another, \"everybody looks  different through them, anyway.\"    \"Oh,\" cried Joel, \"come out into the kitchen, Polly; it's a great deal  better out there.\"    \"May I?\" asked Polly, who was in such a twitter looking at everything  that she didn't know which way to turn.    \"Yes,\" said the doctor, smiling at her.    \"Well, then,\" sang Polly, \"come mammy, we'll go first; isn't it just  lovely--oh, MAMMY!\" and Polly turned so very pale, and looked as if she  were going to tumble right over, that Mrs. Pepper grasped her arm in  dismay.    \"What is it?\" she asked, pointing to the corner, while all the children  stood round in the greatest excitement.    \"Why,\" cried Phronsie, \"it's a stove--don't you know, Polly?\" But Polly  gave one plunge across the room, and before anybody could think, she was  down on her knees with her arms flung right around the big, black thing,  and laughing and crying over it, all in the same breath!    And then they all took hold of hands and danced around it like wild  little things; while Dr. Fisher stole out silently--and Mrs. Pepper  laughed till she wiped her eyes to see them go.    \"We aren't ever goin' to have any more burnt bread,\" sang Polly, all out  of breath.    \"Nor your back isn't goin' to break any more,\" panted Ben, with a very  red face.    \"Hooray!\" screamed Joel and David, to fill any pause that might occur,  while Phronsie gurgled and laughed at everything just as it came along.  And then they all danced and capered again; all but Polly, who was  down before the precious stove examining and exploring into ovens and  everything that belonged to it.    \"Oh, ma,\" she announced, coming up to Mrs. Pepper, who had been obliged  to fly to her sewing again, and exhibiting a very crocky face and a  pair of extremely smutty hands, \"it's most all ovens, and it's just  splendid!\"    \"I know it,\" answered her mother, delighted in the joy of her child.  \"My! how black you are, Polly!\"    \"Oh, I wish,\" cried Polly, as the thought struck her, \"that Dr. Fisher  could see it! Where did he go to, ma?\"    \"I guess Dr. Fisher has seen it before,\" said Mrs. Pepper, and then  she began to laugh. \"You haven't ever asked where the stove came from,  Polly.\"    And to be sure, Polly had been so overwhelmed that if the stove had  really dropped from the clouds it would have been small matter of  astonishment to her, as long as it had come; that was the main thing!    \"Mammy,\" said Polly, turning around slowly, with the stove-lifter in her  hand, \"did Dr. Fisher bring that stove?\"    \"He didn't exactly bring it,\" answered her mother, \"but I guess he knew  something about it.\"    \"Oh, he's the splendidest, goodest man!\" cried Polly, \"that ever  breathed! Did he really get us that stove?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"he would; I couldn't stop him. I don't know  how he found out you wanted one so bad; but he said it must be kept as a  surprise when your eyes got well.\"    \"And he saved my eyes!\" cried Polly, full of gratitude. \"I've got a  stove and two new eyes, mammy, just to think!\"    \"We ought to be good after all our mercies,\" said Mrs. Pepper  thankfully, looking around on her little group. Joel was engaged in the  pleasing occupation of seeing how far he could run his head into the  biggest oven, and then pulling it out to exhibit its blackness, thus  engrossing the others in a perfect hubbub.    \"I'm going to bake my doctor some little cakes,\" declared Polly, when  there was comparative quiet.    \"Do, Polly,\" cried Joel, \"and then leave one or two over.\"    \"No,\" said Polly; \"we can't have any, because these must be very nice.  Mammy, can't I have some white on top, just once?\" she pleaded.    \"I don't know,\" dubiously replied Mrs. Pepper; \"eggs are dreadful dear,  and--\"    \"I don't care,\" said Polly, recklessly; \"I must just once for Dr.  Fisher.\"    \"I tell you, Polly,\" said Mrs. Pepper, \"what you might do; you might  make him some little apple tarts--most every one likes them, you know.\"    \"Well,\" said Polly, with a sigh, \"I s'pose they'll have to do; but some  time, mammy, I'm going to bake him a big cake, so there!\"          A THREATENED BLOW      One day, a few weeks after, Mrs. Pepper and Polly were busy in  the kitchen. Phronsie was out in the \"orchard,\" as the one scraggy  apple-tree was called by courtesy, singing her rag doll to sleep under  its sheltering branches. But \"Baby\" was cross and wouldn't go to sleep,  and Phronsie was on the point of giving up, and returning to the house,  when a strain of music made her pause with dolly in her apron. There  she stood with her finger in her mouth, in utter astonishment, wondering  where the sweet sounds came from.  "]]]
