XXVII      There was a rumour abroad that the Emperor Charles was going to annul  the right of the monks to inherit the estates of those who happened to  die in their convents, a thing which was very displeasing to the Pope.    One day when Ulenspiegel was come to fish from the banks of the  river Meuse, he was thinking to himself that by the above action the  Emperor would stand to profit both ways, since he would inherit the  said estates, while the family of the deceased would inherit nothing  at all. Pondering these thoughts, he carefully baited his hook, and  then sat down by the river-side. And he began to nibble at a piece of  stale brown bread, regretting the while that he had no good Romagna  wine wherewith to wash it down. Still, he thought, one cannot always  have everything just as one would like. And all the time he kept on  throwing little pieces of his bread into the water, saying to himself  that no man deserves a meal who will not share it with his neighbours.    Now it was that a gudgeon came upon the scene, attracted in the first  place by the odour of bread-crumbs; and he licked up the bread with his  lips and opened his mouth for more, thinking no doubt in his innocence  that the bread would fall into his gullet of itself. But while gazing  thus in the air the gudgeon was suddenly swallowed up by a treacherous  pike who had hurled himself upon him like a flash of lightning.    Now the pike played a similar trick upon a carp who was catching flies  on the top of the water without any fear of danger. And after this  good meal the pike stayed motionless below the surface of the water,  disdainful of the smaller fry, who, indeed, were only too glad to swim  away from him of their own accord and as fast as ever they could. But  while the pike was taking his ease in this manner, a second pike came  up; and he was a hungry pike, and his mouth was open wide, for as yet  he had not breakfasted. With a bound the new arrival threw himself  upon his brother, and a furious combat ensued. They lashed at one  another with their fins, the water was red with their blood. The pike  that had eaten defended himself but feebly against the assaults of the  hungry one; nevertheless, backing a little, he took courage again and  threw himself like a bullet against his adversary. The latter awaited  this new attack with open jaws, which did not close until more than  half of his assailant's head had disappeared between them. Now they  tried to free themselves, but could not because of the hooked teeth  of the one that had become embedded in the flesh of the other. And  so they battled against each other in despair. Nor did they notice,  interlocked as they were, the strong fish-hook at the end of a silken  cord, which rose towards them from the depths of the water. In another  moment it had embedded itself in the body of the pike that had dined,  and the two struggling fish found themselves drawn out of the water  and laid together on the grass without the least deference.    As he killed them Ulenspiegel said:    \"Ha ha, my little pikes, I will call you the Pope and the Emperor,  that prey ever one upon the other; but I, forsooth, am the Common  Man that shall catch you on his hook, in God's good time, and make  an end of your battles!\"              XXVIII      In the meantime Nele was taking care of Katheline, who was still  out of her mind and who called continually upon Hanske, her ice-cold  lover. But sometimes Nele would leave her mother safely guarded in the  house of some kindly neighbour, and herself would wander far and wide  and all alone, even unto Antwerp, searching ever, among the ships on  the river, or along the dusty roads, for Ulenspiegel.    And at home, also, in the house of Claes, it was evil days. Claes  worked sadly on his land alone, for there was not enough work for  two. And Soetkin stayed in the cottage by herself, cooking the beans  which formed their daily fare in a hundred different ways, so that  she might have something to enliven her husband's appetite. And she  sang and laughed all the time, so that he might not be grieved by  seeing her unhappy.    One day a man on horseback drew up in front of the cottage. He was  dressed all in black, he was very thin, and very sad of countenance.    \"Is any one within?\" he asked.    \"God bless your sadness,\" answered Soetkin, \"but am I a phantom,  that seeing me here you must yet inquire if there is any one within?\"    \"Where is your father?\" asked the horseman.    \"If my father's name is Claes, he is over there,\" Soetkin told  him. \"You will find him sowing corn.\"    The horseman departed in the direction in which she had pointed,  and Soetkin also went her way ruefully, for this was the sixth time  that she had had to go to the baker's to buy bread with no money to  pay for it.    On returning empty-handed to the cottage, Soetkin was amazed to see  Claes coming down the road triumphantly seated on the horse of the man  in black. He looked very proud of himself, and the man in black walked  by his side holding the horse's bridle. Hanging at his side, Claes  held a leathern bag which appeared to be full of things. Dismounting  from the horse, Claes embraced his companion, gave him a playful pat  upon the back, and then, shaking the bag, cried out in a loud voice:    \"Long life to Josse, my brother, the good hermit of Meyborg! May  God keep him in joy and fatness, in happiness and health! Our Josse,  patron of plenty, and of all abundance, and rich soups!\"    And so saying he took up the sack and deposited it upon the table. But  Soetkin said sadly:    \"My good man, we shall not eat this day. The baker has refused to  give me any bread.\"    \"Bread?\" cried Claes, opening the sack and letting a river of golden  coins roll out on the table. \"Bread? Here is bread and butter, meat,  wine, beer! Here are hams, marrow-bones, pasties, ortolans, fatted  poulets, castrelins, all just as you might find them in the houses of  the rich! Bread indeed! Here are casks of beer and kegs of wine! Mad  must be the baker who will refuse to give us bread. Verily we will  deal at his shop no more!\"    \"But, my good man!\" said Soetkin amazed.    \"Nay, listen,\" said Claes, \"and make the most of your good fortune. For  these are the facts. Katheline, it seems, has lately been to Meyborg  in Germany, and Nele with her, on a visit to my eldest brother Josse,  who dwells there as a hermit. Nele told my brother how that we were  living in poverty, notwithstanding that we work so hard. And now,  if we are to believe this good messenger\"--and here Claes pointed  to the black horseman--\"Josse has left the holy Roman religion and  abandoned himself to the heresy of Luther.\"    The man in black made answer:    \"It is they that are heretics, they who follow the cult of the Scarlet  Woman. For the Pope is a cheat and a trader in holy things.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Soetkin, \"speak not so loud, sir. You will have us burned  alive, all three.\"    \"Well,\" continued Claes, \"it appears that Josse has made known to this  good messenger that inasmuch as he is going to fight in the army of  Frederic of Saxony, and is bringing him fifty armed men fully equipped,  he has no need of much money to leave it to the hands of some wretch  of a landsknecht, now that he himself is going to the war. Therefore,  says he, take it to my brother Claes, and render to him, with my  blessing, these seven hundred florins. Tell him to live virtuously,  and to ponder the salvation of his soul.\"    \"Yea, verily,\" said the horseman, \"now is the time. For God will  reward every man according to his works, and every man according to  his merit.\"    \"Good sir,\" said Claes, \"it is not forbidden, I trust, to rejoice  in the meantime at this good news? Deign, then, to stay with us,  and we will celebrate our fortune with a nice dinner of tripe,  well boiled, and a knuckle of that ham which I saw just now at the  pork-butcher's. Of a truth, it looked so plump and tasty that my  teeth almost shot out of my mouth to close thereon.\"    \"Alas!\" said the stranger, \"the foolish make merry while the eye of  the Lord is yet upon them.\"    \"Come now, messenger,\" said Claes, \"will you eat and drink with us  or will you not?\"    The man answered: \"It will be time enough for the faithful to think  about such earthly joys when mighty Babylon has fallen.\"    Seeing Claes and Soetkin cross themselves, he made as though to leave  them. But Claes said to him:    \"Since you persist in leaving us without accepting of our hospitality,  will you at least give to my brother the kiss of peace on my behalf,  and look after him well at the wars.\"    \"That will I,\" said the man.    And he departed from them, while Soetkin went to make her preparations  for celebrating their good fortune.    Now it was quickly noised abroad through the town that Claes that was  once so poor had now become rich through the generosity of his brother  Josse. And the Dean of Damme was heard to say that it was Katheline no  doubt who had laid a charm on Josse, and he said this because Claes,  although he had received a large sum of money from his brother,  had given not so much as a single vestment to Notre Dame. But Claes  and Soetkin were happy again, Claes working in the fields or looking  after his business of charcoal-burning, while Soetkin attended to her  home right valiantly. Yet still was she sorrowful at heart, scanning  ever with her eyes the open road if perchance she might see her son  Ulenspiegel returning back to her. And thus it was these three lived  on and experienced the happiness which comes from God while waiting  for that which was going to come to them from men.              XXIX      The Emperor Charles had received a letter from England, from Philip,  who was now married to the Queen of that country.          \"Sir and Father,\" the letter "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3760"],[0,"Sybil, Or, The Two Nations (#13)"],[1,"of pale brick with the names  painted on them, of Sion, Bethel, Bethesda: names of a distant land,  and the language of a persecuted and ancient race: yet, such is the  mysterious power of their divine quality, breathing consolation in the  nineteenth century to the harassed forms and the harrowed souls of a  Saxon peasantry.    But however devoted to his flock might have been the Vicar of Marney,  his exertions for their well being, under any circumstances, must have  been mainly limited to spiritual consolation. Married and a father he  received for his labours the small tithes of the parish, which secured  to him an income by no means equal to that of a superior banker's clerk,  or the cook of a great loanmonger. The great tithes of Marney, which  might be counted by thousands, swelled the vast rental which was drawn  from this district by the fortunate earls that bore its name.    The morning after the arrival of Egremont at the Abbey, an unusual  stir might have been observed in the high Street of the town. Round  the portico of the Green Dragon hotel and commercial inn, a knot of  principal personages, the chief lawyer, the brewer, the vicar himself,  and several of those easy quidnuncs who abound in country towns, and who  rank under the designation of retired gentlemen, were in close and very  earnest converse. In a short time a servant on horseback in the Abbey  livery galloped up to the portico, and delivered a letter to the vicar.  The excitement apparently had now greatly increased. On the opposite  side of the way to the important group, a knot, larger in numbers  but very deficient in quality, had formed themselves, and remained  transfixed with gaping mouths and a Curious not to say alarmed air. The  head constable walked up to the door of the Green Dragon, and though  he did not presume to join the principal group, was evidently in  attendance, if required. The clock struck eleven; a cart had stopped to  watch events, and a gentleman's coachman riding home with a led horse.    \"Here they are!\" said the brewer.    \"Lord Marney himself,\" said the lawyer.    \"And Sir Vavasour Firebrace, I declare. I wonder how he came here,\" said  a retired gentleman, who had been a tallow-chandler on Holborn Hill.    The vicar took off his hat, and all uncovered. Lord Marney and his  brother magistrate rode briskly up to the inn and rapidly dismounted.    \"Well, Snigford,\" said his lordship, in a peremptory tone, \"this is a  pretty business; I'll have this stopped directly.\"    Fortunate man if he succeed in doing so! The torch of the incendiary had  for the first time been introduced into the parish of Marney; and last  night the primest stacks of the Abbey farm had blazed a beacon to the  agitated neighbourhood.          Book 2 Chapter 4        \"It is not so much the fire, sir,\" said Mr Bingley of the Abbey farm  to Egremont, \"but the temper of the people that alarms me. Do you know,  sir, there were two or three score of them here, and, except my own  farm servants, not one of them would lend a helping hand to put out  the flames, though, with water so near, they might have been of great  service.\"    \"You told my brother, Lord Marney, this?\"    \"Oh! it's Mr Charles I'm speaking to! My service to you, sir; I'm glad  to see you in these parts again. It's a long time that we have had that  pleasure, sir. Travelling in foreign parts, as I have heard say?\"    \"Something of that; but very glad to find myself at home once more, Mr  Bingley, though very sorry to have such a welcome as a blazing rick at  the Abbey farm.\"    \"Well, do you know, Mr Charles, between ourselves,\" and Mr Bingley  lowered his tone, and looked around him, \"Things is very bad here; I  can't make out, for my part, what has become of the country. Tayn't  the same land to live in as it was when you used to come to our moor  coursing, with the old lord; you remember that, I be sure, Mr Charles?\"    \"'Tis not easy to forget good sport, Mr Bingley. With your permission, I  will put my horse up here for half an hour. I have a fancy to stroll to  the ruins.\"    \"You wunna find them much changed,\" said the farmer, smiling. \"They have  seen a deal of different things in their time! But you will taste our  ale, Mr Charles?\"    \"When I return.\"    But the hospitable Bingley would take no denial, and as his companion  waived on the present occasion entering his house, for the sun had been  some time declining, the farmer, calling one of his labourers to take  Egremont's horse, hastened into the house to fill the brimming cup.    \"And what do you think of this fire?\" said Egremont to the hind.    \"I think 'tis hard times for the poor, sir.\"    \"But rick-burning will not make the times easier, my good man.\"    The man made no reply, but with a dogged look led away the horse to his  stable.    About half a mile from Marney, the dale narrowed, and the river took  a winding course. It ran through meads, soft and vivid with luxuriant  vegetation, bounded on either side by rich hanging woods, save where  occasionally a quarry broke the verdant bosom of the heights with its  rugged and tawny form. Fair stone and plenteous timber, and the current  of fresh waters, combined, with the silent and secluded scene screened  from every harsh and angry wind, to form the sacred spot that in  old days Holy Church loved to hallow with its beauteous and enduring  structures. Even the stranger therefore when he had left the town about  two miles behind him, and had heard the farm and mill which he had  since passed, called the Abbey farm and the Abbey mill, might have  been prepared for the grateful vision of some monastic remains. As for  Egremont, he had been almost born amid the ruins of Marney Abbey; its  solemn relics were associated with his first and freshest fancies; every  footstep was as familiar to him as it could have been to one of the  old monks; yet never without emotion could he behold these unrivalled  remains of one of the greatest of the great religious houses of the  North.    Over a space of not less than ten acres might still be observed the  fragments of the great abbey: these were, towards their limit, in  general moss-grown and mouldering memorials that told where once rose  the offices and spread the terraced gardens of the old proprietors; here  might still be traced the dwelling of the lord abbot; and there, still  more distinctly, because built on a greater scale and of materials still  more intended for perpetuity, the capacious hospital, a name that did  not then denote the dwelling of disease, but a place where all the  rights of hospitality were practised; where the traveller from the proud  baron to the lonely pilgrim asked the shelter and the succour that  never were denied, and at whose gate, called the Portal of the Poor,  the peasants on the Abbey lands, if in want, might appeal each morn and  night for raiment and for food.    But it was in the centre of this tract of ruins, occupying a space of  not less than two acres, that, with a strength that had defied time, and  with a beauty that had at last turned away the wrath of man, still rose  if not in perfect, yet admirable, form and state, one of the noblest  achievements of Christian art,--the Abbey church. The summer vault was  now its only roof, and all that remained of its gorgeous windows was  the vastness of their arched symmetry, and some wreathed relics of their  fantastic frame-work, but the rest was uninjured.    From the west window, looking over the transept chapel of the Virgin,  still adorned with pillars of marble and alabaster, the eye wandered  down the nave to the great orient light, a length of nearly three  hundred feet, through a gorgeous avenue of unshaken walls and columns  that clustered to the skies, On each side of the Lady's chapel rose a  tower. One which was of great antiquity, being of that style which is  commonly called Norman, short and very thick and square, did not mount  much above the height of the western front; but the other tower was of  a character very different, It was tall and light, and of a Gothic style  most pure and graceful; the stone of which it was built, of a bright and  even sparkling colour, and looking as if it were hewn but yesterday.  At first, its turretted crest seemed injured; but the truth is, it was  unfinished; the workmen were busied on this very tower the day that old  Baldwin Greymount came as the king's commissioner to inquire into the  conduct of this religious house. The abbots loved to memorise their  reigns by some public work, which should add to the beauty of their  buildings or the convenience of their subjects; and the last of the  ecclesiastical lords of Marney, a man of fine taste and a skilful  architect, was raising this new belfry for his brethren when the stern  decree arrived that the bells should no more sound. And the hymn was no  more to be chaunted in the Lady's chapel; and the candles were no more  to be lit on the high altar; and the gate of the poor was to be closed  for ever; and the wanderer was no more to find a home.    The body of the church was in many parts overgrown with brambles and in  all covered with a rank vegetation. It had been a very sultry day, and  the blaze of the meridian heat still inflamed the air; the kine for  shelter, rather than for sustenance, had wandered through some broken  arches, and were lying in the shadow of the nave. This desecration of a  spot, once sacred, still beautiful and solemn, jarred on the feelings of  Egremont. He sighed and turning away, followed a path that after a  few paces led him into the cloister garden. This was a considerable  quadrangle; once surrounding the garden of the monks, but all that  remained of that fair pleasaunce was a solitary yew in its centre,  that seemed the oldest tree that could well live, and was, according  to tradition, more ancient than the most venerable walls of the Abbey.  Round this quadrangle was the refectory, "]]]
