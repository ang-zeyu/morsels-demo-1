These are words  that began, in the second quarter of the seventeenth century, to shine  and ring. King and people had reached the verge of a great struggle. The  Virginia Company was divided, as were other groups, into factions. The  court party and the country party found themselves distinctly opposed.  The great, crowded meetings of the Company Sessions rang with  their divisions upon policies small and large. Words and phrases,  comprehensive, sonorous, heavy with the future, rose and rolled beneath  the roof of their great hall. There were heard amid warm discussion:  Kingdom and Colony--Spain--Netherlands--France--Church and  State--Papists and Schismatics--Duties, Tithes, Excise Petitions of  Grievances--Representation--Right of Assembly. Several years earlier  the King had cried, \"Choose the Devil, but not Sir Edwyn Sandys!\" Now  he declared the Company \"just a seminary to a seditious parliament!\" All  London resounded with the clash of parties and opinions.* \"Last week  the Earl of Warwick and the Lord Cavendish fell so foul at a Virginia...  court that the lie passed and repassed.... The factions... are grown so  violent that Guelfs and Ghibellines were not more animated one against  another!\"         * In his work on \"Joint-stock Companion\", vol.II, pp. 266       ff., W. R. Scott traces the history of these acute       dissensions in the Virginia Company and draws conclusions       distinctly unfavorable to the management of Sandys and his       party.--Editor.    Believing that the Company's sessions foreshadowed a \"seditious  parliament,\" James Stuart set himself with obstinacy and some cunning  to the Company's undoing. The court party gave the King aid, and  circumstances favored the attempt. Captain Nathaniel Butler, who had  once been Governor of the Somers Islands and had now returned to England  by way of Virginia, published in London \"The Unmasked Face of Our Colony  in Virginia\", containing a savage attack upon every item of Virginian  administration.    The King's Privy Council summoned the Company, or rather the \"country\"  party, to answer these and other allegations. Southampton, Sandys, and  Ferrar answered with strength and cogency. But the tide was running  against them. James appointed commissioners to search out what was wrong  with Virginia. Certain men were shipped to Virginia to get evidence  there, as well as support from the Virginia Assembly. In this attempt  they signally failed. Then to England came a Virginia member of the  Virginia Council, with long letters to King and Privy Council: the  Sandys-Southampton administration had done more than well for Virginia.  The letters were letters of appeal. The colony hoped that \"the Governors  sent over might not have absolute authority, but might be restrained  to the consent of the Council.... But above all they made it their most  humble request that they might still retain the liberty of their  General Assemblies; than which nothing could more conduce to the publick  Satisfaction and publick Liberty.\"    In London another paper, drawn by Cavendish, was given to King and Privy  Council. It answered many accusations, and among others the statement  that \"the Government of the companies as it then stood was democratical  and tumultuous, and ought therefore to be altered, and reduced into the  Hands of a few.\" It is of interest to hear these men speak, in the year  1623, in an England that was close to absolute monarchy, to a King who  with all his house stood out for personal rule. \"However, they owned  that, according to his Majesty's Institution, their Government had some  Show of a democratical Form; which was nevertheless, in that Case, the  most just and profitable, and most conducive to the Ends and Effects  aimed at thereby.... Lastly, they observed that the opposite Faction  cried out loudly against Democracy, and yet called for Oligarchy; which  would, as they conceived, make the Government neither of better Form,  nor more monarchical.\"    But the dissolution of the Virginia Company was at hand. In October,  1623, the Privy Council stated that the King had \"taken into his  princely Consideration the distressed State of the Colony of Virginia,  occasioned, as it seemed, by the Ill Government of the Company.\" The  remedy for the ill-management lay in the reduction of the Government  into fewer hands. His Majesty had resolved therefore upon the withdrawal  of the Company's charter and the substitution, \"with due regard for  continuing and preserving the Interest of all Adventurers and private  persons whatsoever,\" of a new order of things. The new order proved, on  examination, to be the old order of rule by the Crown. Would the Company  surrender the old charter and accept a new one so modeled?    The Company, through the country party, strove to gain time. They met  with a succession of arbitrary measures and were finally forced to a  decision. They would not surrender their charter. Then a writ of  quo warranto was issued; trial before the King's Bench followed; and  judgment was rendered against the Company in the spring term of 1624.  Thus with clangor fell the famous Virginia Company.    That was one year. The March of the next year James Stuart, King of  England, died. That young Henry who was Prince of Wales when the Susan  Constant, the Goodspeed, and the Discovery sailed past a cape and named  it for him Cape Henry, also had died. His younger brother Charles, for  whom was named that other and opposite cape, now ascended the throne as  King Charles the First of England.    In Virginia no more General Assemblies are held for four years.  King Charles embarks upon \"personal rule.\" Sir Francis Wyatt, a good  Governor, is retained by commission and a Council is appointed by  the King. No longer are affairs to be conducted after a fashion  \"democratical and tumultuous.\" Orders are transmitted from England;  the Governor, assisted by the Council, will take into cognizance purely  local needs; and when he sees some occasion he will issue a proclamation.    Wyatt, recalled finally to England; George Yeardley again, who died in  a year's time; Francis West, that brother of Lord De La Warr and an  ancient planter--these in quick succession sit in the Governor's chair.  Following them John Pott, doctor of medicine, has his short term.  Then the King sends out Sir John Harvey, avaricious and arbitrary,  \"so haughty and furious to the Council and the best gentlemen of the  country,\" says Beverley, \"that his tyranny grew at last insupportable.\"    The Company previously, and now the King, had urged upon the Virginians  a diversified industry and agriculture. But Englishmen in Virginia  had the familiar emigrant idea of making their fortunes. They had left  England; they had taken their lives in their hands; they had suffered  fevers, Indian attacks, homesickness, deprivation. They had come to  Virginia to get rich. Now clapboards and sassafras, pitch, tar, and pine  trees for masts, were making no fortune for Virginia shippers. How could  they, these few folk far off in America, compete in products of the  forest with northern Europe? As to mines of gold and silver, that first  rich vision had proved a disheartening mirage. \"They have great hopes  that the mountains are very rich, from the discovery of a silver mine  made nineteen years ago, at a place about four days' journey from the  falls of James river; but they have not the means of transporting the  ore.\" So, dissatisfied with some means of livelihood and disappointed in  others, the Virginians turned to tobacco.    Every year each planter grew more tobacco; every year more ships were  laden. In 1628 more than five hundred thousand pounds were sent to  England, for to England it must go, and not elsewhere. There it must  struggle with the best Spanish, for a long time valued above the best  Virginian. Finally, however, James and after him Charles, agreed to  exclude the Spanish. Virginia and the Somers Islands alone might import  tobacco into England. But offsetting this, customs went up ruinously; a  great lump sum must go annually to the King; the leaf must enter only  at the port of London; so forth and so on. Finally Charles put forth his  proposal to monopolize the industry, giving Virginia tobacco the English  market but limiting its production to the amount which the Government  could sell advantageously. Such a policy required cooperation from the  colonists. The King therefore ordered the Governor to grant a Virginia  Assembly, which in turn should dutifully enter into partnership with  him--upon his terms. So the Virginia Assembly thus came back into  history. It made a \"Humble Answere\" in which, for all its humility, the  King's proposal was declined. The idea of the royal monopoly faded out,  and Virginia continued on its own way.    The General Assembly, having once met, seems of its own motion to have  continued meeting. The next year we find it in session at Jamestown, and  resolving \"that we should go three severall marches upon the Indians, at  three severall times of the yeare,\" and also \"that there be an especiall  care taken by all commanders and others that the people doe repaire to  their churches on the Saboth day, and to see that the penalty of one  pound of tobacco for every time of absence, and 50 pounds for every  month's absence... be levyed, and the delinquents to pay the same.\"  About this time we read: \"Dr. John Pott, late Governor, indicted,  arraigned, and found guilty of stealing cattle, 13 jurors, 3 whereof  councellors. This day wholly spent in pleading; next day, in unnecessary  disputation.\"    These were moving times in the little colony whose population may by now  have been five thousand. Harvey, the Governor, was rapacious; the King  at home, autocratic. Meanwhile, signs of change and of unrest were not  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2900"],[0,"The Age of Invention: A Chronicle of Mechanical Conquest (#13)"],[1," of all  kinds.      Such were the beginnings of the great textile mills of New England.  The scene today is vastly changed. Productivity has been multiplied by  invention after invention, by the erection of mill after mill, and by  the employment of thousands of hands in place of hundreds. Lowell as  a textile center has long been surpassed by other cities. The scene in  Lowell itself is vastly changed. If Charles Dickens could visit Lowell  today, he would hardly recognize in that city of modern factories, of  more than a hundred thousand people, nearly half of them foreigners, the  Utopia of 1842 which he saw and described.      The cotton plantations in the South were flourishing, and Whitney's gins  were cleaning more and more cotton; the sheep of a thousand hills were  giving wool; Arkwright's machines in England, introduced by Slater into  New England, were spinning the cotton and wool into yarn; Cartwright's  looms in England and Lowell's improvements in New England were weaving  the yarn into cloth; but as yet no practical machine had been invented  to sew the cloth into clothes.    There were in the United States numerous small workshops where a few  tailors or seamstresses, gathered under one roof, laboriously sewed  garments together, but the great bulk of the work, until the invention  of the sewing machine, was done by the wives and daughters of farmers  and sailors in the villages around Boston, New York, and Philadelphia.  In these cities the garments were cut and sent out to the dwellings  of the poor to be sewn. The wages of the laborers were notoriously  inadequate, though probably better than in England. Thomas Hood's ballad  The Song of the Shirt, published in 1843, depicts the hardships of the  English woman who strove to keep body and soul together by means of the  needle:         With fingers weary and worn,         With eyelids heavy and red,       A woman sat in unwomanly rags,         Plying her needle and thread.    Meanwhile, as Hood wrote and as the whole English people learned by  heart his vivid lines, as great ladies wept over them and street singers  sang them in the darkest slums of London, a man, hungry and ill-clad, in  an attic in faraway Cambridge, Massachusetts, was struggling to put into  metal an idea to lighten the toil of those who lived by the needle. His  name was Elias Howe and he hailed from Eli Whitney's old home, Worcester  County, Massachusetts. There Howe was born in 1819. His father was an  unsuccessful farmer, who also had some small mills, but seems to have  succeeded in nothing he undertook.    Young Howe led the ordinary life of a New England country boy, going to  school in winter and working about the farm until the age of sixteen,  handling tools every day, like any farmer's boy of the time. Hearing  of high wages and interesting work in Lowell, that growing town on the  Merrimac, he went there in 1835 and found employment; but two years  later, when the panic of 1837 came on, he left Lowell and went to work  in a machine shop in Cambridge. It is said that, for a time, he occupied  a room with his cousin, Nathaniel P. Banks, who rose from bobbin boy in  a cotton mill to Speaker of the United States House of Representatives  and Major-General in the Civil War.    Next we hear of Howe in Boston, working in the shop of Ari Davis, an  eccentric maker and repairer of fine machinery. Here the young mechanic  heard of the desirability of a sewing machine and began to puzzle over  the problem. Many an inventor before him had attempted to make sewing  machines and some had just fallen short of success. Thomas Saint, an  Englishman, had patented one fifty years earlier; and about this very  time a Frenchman named Thimmonier was working eighty sewing machines  making army uniforms, when needle workers of Paris, fearing that the  bread was to be taken from them, broke into his workroom and destroyed  the machines. Thimmonier tried again, but his machine never came into  general use. Several patents had been issued on sewing machines in  the United States, but without any practical result. An inventor named  Walter Hunt had discovered the principle of the lock-stitch and had  built a machine but had wearied of his work and abandoned his invention,  just as success was in sight. But Howe knew nothing of any of these  inventors. There is no evidence that he had ever seen the work of  another.    The idea obsessed him to such an extent that he could do no other work,  and yet he must live. By this time he was married and had children, and  his wages were only nine dollars a week. Just then an old schoolmate,  George Fisher, agreed to support his family and furnish him with five  hundred dollars for materials and tools. The attic in Fisher's house in  Cambridge was Howe's workroom. His first efforts were failures, but all  at once the idea of the lock-stitch came to him. Previously all machines  (except Hunt's, which was unknown, not having even been patented) had  used the chainstitch, wasteful of thread and easily unraveled. The two  threads of the lockstitch cross in the materials joined together, and  the lines of stitches show the same on both sides. In short, the  chainstitch is a crochet or knitting stitch, while the lockstitch is a  weaving stitch. Howe had been working at night and was on his way home,  gloomy and despondent, when this idea dawned on his mind, probably  rising out of his experience in the cotton mill. The shuttle would be  driven back and forth as in a loom, as he had seen it thousands of  times, and passed through a loop of thread which the curved needle would  throw out on the other side of the cloth; and the cloth would be  fastened to the machine vertically by pins. A curved arm would ply the  needle with the motion of a pick-axe. A handle attached to the fly-wheel  would furnish the power.    On that design Howe made a machine which, crude as it was, sewed more  rapidly than five of the swiftest needle workers. But apparently to no  purpose. His machine was too expensive, it could sew only a straight  seam, and it might easily get out of order. The needle workers were  opposed, as they have generally been, to any sort of laborsaving  machinery, and there was no manufacturer willing to buy even one machine  at the price Howe asked, three hundred dollars.    Howe's second model was an improvement on the first. It was more compact  and it ran more smoothly. He had no money even to pay the fees necessary  to get it patented. Again Fisher came to the rescue and took Howe and  his machine to Washington, paying all the expenses, and the patent was  issued in September, 1846. But, as the machine still failed to find  buyers, Fisher gave up hope. He had invested about two thousand dollars  which seemed gone forever, and he could not, or would not, invest more.  Howe returned temporarily to his father's farm, hoping for better times.    Meanwhile Howe had sent one of his brothers to London with a machine to  see if a foothold could be found there, and in due time an encouraging  report came to the destitute inventor. A corsetmaker named Thomas  had paid two hundred and fifty pounds for the English rights and  had promised to pay a royalty of three pounds on each machine sold.  Moreover, Thomas invited the inventor to London to construct a machine  especially for making corsets. Howe went to London and later sent for  his family. But after working eight months on small wages, he was as  badly off as ever, for, though he had produced the desired machine, he  quarrelled with Thomas and their relations came to an end.    An acquaintance, Charles Inglis, advanced Howe a little money while he  worked on another model. This enabled Howe to send his family home to  America, and then, by selling his last model and pawning his patent  rights, he raised enough money to take passage himself in the steerage  in 1848, accompanied by Inglis, who came to try his fortune in the  United States.    Howe landed in New York with a few cents in his pocket and immediately  found work. But his wife was dying from the hardships she had suffered,  due to stark poverty. At her funeral, Howe wore borrowed clothes, for  his only suit was the one he wore in the shop.    Then, soon after his wife had died, Howe's invention came into its own.  It transpired presently that sewing machines were being made and sold  and that these machines were using the principles covered by Howe's  patent. Howe found an ally in George W. Bliss, a man of means, who had  faith in the machine and who bought out Fisher's interest and proceeded  to prosecute infringers. Meanwhile Howe went on making machines--he  produced fourteen in New York during 1850--and never lost an opportunity  to show the merits of the invention which was being advertised  and brought to notice by the activities of some of the infringers,  particularly by Isaac M. Singer, the best business man of them all.  Singer had joined hands with Walter Hunt and Hunt had tried to patent  the machine which he had abandoned nearly twenty years before.    The suits dragged on until 1854, when the case was decisively settled  in Howe's favor. His patent was declared basic, and all the makers of  sewing machines must pay him a royalty of twenty-five dollars on every  machine. So Howe woke one morning to find himself enjoying a large  income, which in time rose as high as four thousand dollars a week, and  he died in 1867 a rich man.    Though the basic nature of Howe's patent was recognized, his machine was  only a rough beginning. Improvements followed, one after another, until  the sewing machine bore little resemblance to Howe's original. John  Bachelder introduced the horizontal table upon which to lay the  work. Through an opening in the table, tiny spikes in an endless belt  projected and pushed the work for ward continuously. Allan B. Wilson  devised a rotary hook carrying a bobbin to do the work of the shuttle,  and also the small"]]]
