The FIS response has resulted in  a continuous low-grade civil conflict with the secular state  apparatus, which nonetheless has allowed elections featuring  pro-government and moderate religious-based parties. FIS's armed  wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded itself in January 2000  and many armed militants surrendered under an amnesty program  designed to promote national reconciliation. Nevertheless, residual  fighting continues. Other concerns include large-scale unemployment  and the need to diversify the petroleum-based economy.

Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and statist    policies, the economy in the late 1980s was plagued with huge    external debts and recurring bouts of hyperinflation. Elected in    1989, in the depths of recession, President MENEM has implemented a    comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of    putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable growth.    Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar since    April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20    years. Argentines have responded to the relative price stability by    repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry.    After registering impressive 7.4% growth in 1994, based largely on    inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption, the    Argentine economy stumbled in 1995 as financial pressures fueled by    the Mexican peso crisis and political squabbling within the MENEM    administration undermined investor confidence and triggered capital    outflows. By yearend, GDP had contracted 4.4%, unemployment reached    16%, and Buenos Aires struggled to meet fiscal targets. On the trade    front, exports soared during the first half of 1995 - largely    because of strong demand in Brazil and high commodity prices - while    anemic domestic consumption lowered imports; the resulting yearend    trade surplus was about $1.2 billion. However, because exports    contribute only 7.5% to GDP, increased foreign sales had little    impact on aggregate growth. High unemployment will continue to    plague the MENEM administration for the next several years as    provincial entities are readied for privatization and more public    sector employees are laid off.
