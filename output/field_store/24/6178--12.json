On October 23d Parliament met for its autumn session, and we led a  deputation to the House of Commons in another effort to induce the  Government to take action on woman suffrage. In accordance with orders  given the police, only twenty of us were admitted to the Strangers'  Lobby. We sent in for the chief Liberal whip, and asked him to take a  message to the Prime Minister, the message being the usual request to  grant women the vote that session. We also asked the Prime Minister if  he intended to include the registration of qualified women voters in the  provisions of the plural voting bill, then under consideration. The  Liberal whip came back with the reply that nothing could be done for  women that session.    [Illustration: MRS. PANKHURST ADDRESSING A BY-ELECTION CROWD]    \"Does the Prime Minister,\" I asked, \"hold out any hope for the women  for any session during this Parliament, or at any future time?\" The  Prime Minister, you will remember, called himself a suffragist.    The Liberal whip replied, \"No, Mrs. Pankhurst, the Prime Minister does  not.\"    What would a deputation of unenfranchised men have done in these  circumstances--men who knew themselves to be qualified to exercise the  franchise, who desperately needed the protection of the franchise, and  who had a majority of legislators in favour of giving them the  franchise? I hope they would have done at least as much as we did, which  was to start a meeting of protest on the spot. The newspapers described  our action as creating a disgraceful scene in the lobby of the House of  Commons, but I think that history will otherwise describe it. One of the  women sprang up on a settee and began to address the crowd. In less than  a minute she was pulled down, but instantly another woman took her  place; and after she had been dragged down, still another sprang to her  place, and following her another and another, until the order came to  clear the lobby, and we were all forced outside.    In the melee I was thrown to the floor and painfully hurt. The women,  thinking me seriously injured, crowded around me and refused to move  until I was able to regain myself. This angered the police, who were  still more incensed when they found that the demonstration was continued  outside. Eleven women were arrested, including Mrs. Pethick Lawrence,  our treasurer, Mrs. Cobden Sanderson, Annie Kenney and three more of our  organisers; and they were all sent to Holloway for two months. But the  strength of our movement was proved by the number of volunteers who  immediately came forward to carry on the work. Mrs. Tuke, now Hon.  Secretary of the W. S. P. U., joined the Union at this time. It had not  occurred to the authorities that their action would have this effect.  They thought to crush the Union at a blow, but they gave it the greatest  impetus it had yet received. The leaders of the older suffrage  organisations for the time forgot their disapproval of our methods, and  joined with women writers, physicians, actresses, artists, and other  prominent women in denouncing the affair as barbarous.    One more thing the authorities failed to take into account. The  condition of English prisons was known to be very bad, but when two of  our women were made so ill in Holloway that they had to be released  within a few days, the politicians began to tremble for their prestige.  Questions were asked in Parliament concerning the advisability of  treating the Suffragettes not as common criminals but as political  offenders with the right to confinement in the First Division. Mr.  Herbert Gladstone, the Home Secretary, replied to these questions that  he had no power to interfere with the magistrates' decisions, and could  do nothing in the matter of the suffragettes' punishment. I shall ask  you to remember this statement of Mr. Herbert Gladstone's, as later we  were able to prove it a deliberate falsehood--although really the  falsehood proved itself when the women, by Government order, were  released from prison when they had served just half their sentences.  The reason for this was that an important by-election was being held in  the north of England, and we had distributed broadcast throughout the  constituency hand bills telling the electors that nine women, including  the daughter of Richard Cobden, were being held as common criminals by  the Liberal Government who were asking for their votes.    I took a group of the released prisoners to Huddersfield, and they told  prison stories to such effect that the Liberal majority was reduced by  540 votes. As usual the Liberal leaders denied that our work had  anything to do with the slender majority by which the party retained the  seat, but among our souvenirs is a handbill, one of thousands given out  from Liberal headquarters:           +------------------------------+       |     MEN OF HUDDERSFIELD      |       |       DON'T BE MISLED        |       | BY SOCIALISTS, SUFFRAGETTES  |       |          OR TORIES           |       |      VOTE FOR SHERWELL       |       +------------------------------+      Meanwhile, other demonstrations had taken place before the House of  Commons, and at Christmas time twenty-one suffragettes were in Holloway  Prison, though they had committed no crime. The Government professed  themselves unmoved, and members of Parliament spoke with sneers of the  \"self-made martyrs.\" However, a considerable group of members, strongly  moved by the passion and unquenchable ardor of this new order of  suffragists, met during the last week of the year and formed a  committee whose object it was to press upon the government the necessity  of giving the franchise to women during that Parliament. The committee  resolved that its members would work to educate a wider public opinion  on the question, and especially to advocate suffrage when addressing  meetings in their constituencies, to take Parliamentary action on every  possible occasion, and to induce as many members of Parliament as  possible to ballot for the introduction of a suffrage bill or motion  next session.    Our first year in London had borne wonderful fruits. We had grown from a  mere handful of women, a \"family party\" the newspapers had derisively  called us, to a strong organisation with branches all over the country,  permanent headquarters in Clements Inn, Strand; we had found good  financial backing, and above all, we had created a suffrage committee in  the House of Commons.          BOOK II    FOUR YEARS OF PEACEFUL MILITANCY          CHAPTER I      The campaign of 1907 began with a Women's Parliament, called together on  February 13th in Caxton Hall, to consider the provisions of the King's  speech, which had been read in the national Parliament on the opening  day of the session, February 12th. The King's speech, as I have  explained, is the official announcement of the Government's programme  for the session. When our Women's Parliament met at three o'clock on the  afternoon of the thirteenth we knew that the Government meant to do  nothing for women during the session ahead.    I presided over the women's meeting, which was marked with a fervency  and a determination of spirit at that time altogether unprecedented. A  resolution expressing indignation that woman suffrage should have been  omitted from the King's speech, and calling upon the House of Commons to  give immediate facilities to such a measure, was moved and carried. A  motion to send the resolution from the hall to the Prime Minister was  also carried. The slogan, \"Rise up, women,\" was cried from the platform,  the answering shout coming back as from one woman, \"Now!\" With copies of  the resolution in their hands, the chosen deputation hurried forth into  the February dusk, ready for Parliament or prison, as the fates decreed.    Fate did not leave them very long in doubt. The Government, it  appeared, had decided that not again should their sacred halls of  Parliament be desecrated by women asking for the vote, and orders had  been given that would henceforth prevent women from reaching even the  outer precincts of the House of Commons. So when our deputation of women  arrived in the neighbourhood of Westminster Abbey they found themselves  opposed by a solid line of police, who, at a sharp order from their  chief, began to stride through and through the ranks of the procession,  trying to turn the women back. Bravely the women rallied and pressed  forward a little farther. Suddenly a body of mounted police came riding  up at a smart trot, and for the next five hours or more, a struggle,  quite indescribable for brutality and ruthlessness, went on.    The horsemen rode directly into the procession, scattering the women  right and left. But still the women would not turn back. Again and again  they returned, only to fly again and again from the merciless hoofs.  Some of the women left the streets for the pavements, but even there the  horsemen pursued them, pressing them so close to walls and railings that  they were obliged to retreat temporarily to avoid being crushed. Other  strategists took refuge in doorways, but they were dragged out by the  foot police and were thrown directly in front of the horses. Still the  women fought to reach the House of Commons with their resolution. They  fought until their clothes were torn, their bodies bruised, and the last  ounce of their strength exhausted. Fifteen of them did actually fight  their way through those hundreds on hundreds of police, foot and  mounted, as far as the Strangers' Lobby of the House. Here they  attempted to hold a meeting, and were arrested. Outside, many more women  were taken into custody. It was ten o'clock before the last arrest was  made, and the square cleared of the crowds. After that the mounted men  continued to guard the approaches to the House of Commons until"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901"],[0,"On Liberty (#13)"],[1,"direct opposition to some, and are,  on the whole, a compromise between the Christian creed and the interests  and suggestions of worldly life. To the first of these standards he  gives his homage; to the other his real allegiance. All Christians  believe that the blessed are the poor and humble, and those who are  ill-used by the world; that it is easier for a camel to pass through the  eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven; that  they should judge not, lest they be judged; that they should swear not  at all; that they should love their neighbour as themselves; that if one  take their cloak, they should give him their coat also; that they should  take no thought for the morrow; that if they would be perfect, they  should sell all that they have and give it to the poor. They are not  insincere when they say that they believe these things. They do believe  them, as people believe what they have always heard lauded and never  discussed. But in the sense of that living belief which regulates  conduct, they believe these doctrines just up to the point to which it  is usual to act upon them. The doctrines in their integrity are  serviceable to pelt adversaries with; and it is understood that they are  to be put forward (when possible) as the reasons for whatever people do  that they think laudable. But any one who reminded them that the maxims  require an infinity of things which they never even think of doing,  would gain nothing but to be classed among those very unpopular  characters who affect to be better than other people. The doctrines have  no hold on ordinary believers--are not a power in their minds. They have  a habitual respect for the sound of them, but no feeling which spreads  from the words to the things signified, and forces the mind to take  _them_ in, and make them conform to the formula. Whenever conduct is  concerned, they look round for Mr. A and B to direct them how far to go  in obeying Christ.    Now we may be well assured that the case was not thus, but far  otherwise, with the early Christians. Had it been thus, Christianity  never would have expanded from an obscure sect of the despised Hebrews  into the religion of the Roman empire. When their enemies said, \"See how  these Christians love one another\" (a remark not likely to be made by  anybody now), they assuredly had a much livelier feeling of the meaning  of their creed than they have ever had since. And to this cause,  probably, it is chiefly owing that Christianity now makes so little  progress in extending its domain, and after eighteen centuries, is still  nearly confined to Europeans and the descendants of Europeans. Even with  the strictly religious, who are much in earnest about their doctrines,  and attach a greater amount of meaning to many of them than people in  general, it commonly happens that the part which is thus comparatively  active in their minds is that which was made by Calvin, or Knox, or some  such person much nearer in character to themselves. The sayings of  Christ coexist passively in their minds, producing hardly any effect  beyond what is caused by mere listening to words so amiable and bland.  There are many reasons, doubtless, why doctrines which are the badge of  a sect retain more of their vitality than those common to all recognised  sects, and why more pains are taken by teachers to keep their meaning  alive; but one reason certainly is, that the peculiar doctrines are more  questioned, and have to be oftener defended against open gainsayers.  Both teachers and learners go to sleep at their post, as soon as there  is no enemy in the field.    The same thing holds true, generally speaking, of all traditional  doctrines--those of prudence and knowledge of life, as well as of morals  or religion. All languages and literatures are full of general  observations on life, both as to what it is, and how to conduct oneself  in it; observations which everybody knows, which everybody repeats, or  hears with acquiescence, which are received as truisms, yet of which  most people first truly learn the meaning, when experience, generally of  a painful kind, has made it a reality to them. How often, when smarting  under some unforeseen misfortune or disappointment, does a person call  to mind some proverb or common saying, familiar to him all his life, the  meaning of which, if he had ever before felt it as he does now, would  have saved him from the calamity. There are indeed reasons for this,  other than the absence of discussion: there are many truths of which the  full meaning _cannot_ be realised, until personal experience has brought  it home. But much more of the meaning even of these would have been  understood, and what was understood would have been far more deeply  impressed on the mind, if the man had been accustomed to hear it argued  _pro_ and _con_ by people who did understand it. The fatal tendency of  mankind to leave off thinking about a thing when it is no longer  doubtful, is the cause of half their errors. A contemporary author has  well spoken of \"the deep slumber of a decided opinion.\"    But what! (it may be asked) Is the absence of unanimity an indispensable  condition of true knowledge? Is it necessary that some part of mankind  should persist in error, to enable any to realise the truth? Does a  belief cease to be real and vital as soon as it is generally  received--and is a proposition never thoroughly understood and felt  unless some doubt of it remains? As soon as mankind have unanimously  accepted a truth, does the truth perish within them? The highest aim and  best result of improved intelligence, it has hitherto been thought, is  to unite mankind more and more in the acknowledgment of all important  truths: and does the intelligence only last as long as it has not  achieved its object? Do the fruits of conquest perish by the very  completeness of the victory?    I affirm no such thing. As mankind improve, the number of doctrines  which are no longer disputed or doubted will be constantly on the  increase: and the well-being of mankind may almost be measured by the  number and gravity of the truths which have reached the point of being  uncontested. The cessation, on one question after another, of serious  controversy, is one of the necessary incidents of the consolidation of  opinion; a consolidation as salutary in the case of true opinions, as it  is dangerous and noxious when the opinions are erroneous. But though  this gradual narrowing of the bounds of diversity of opinion is  necessary in both senses of the term, being at once inevitable and  indispensable, we are not therefore obliged to conclude that all its  consequences must be beneficial. The loss of so important an aid to the  intelligent and living apprehension of a truth, as is afforded by the  necessity of explaining it to, or defending it against, opponents,  though not sufficient to outweigh, is no trifling drawback from, the  benefit of its universal recognition. Where this advantage can no longer  be had, I confess I should like to see the teachers of mankind  endeavouring to provide a substitute for it; some contrivance for making  the difficulties of the question as present to the learner's  consciousness, as if they were pressed upon him by a dissentient  champion, eager for his conversion.    But instead of seeking contrivances for this purpose, they have lost  those they formerly had. The Socratic dialectics, so magnificently  exemplified in the dialogues of Plato, were a contrivance of this  description. They were essentially a negative discussion of the great  questions of philosophy and life, directed with consummate skill to the  purpose of convincing any one who had merely adopted the commonplaces of  received opinion, that he did not understand the subject--that he as yet  attached no definite meaning to the doctrines he professed; in order  that, becoming aware of his ignorance, he might be put in the way to  attain a stable belief, resting on a clear apprehension both of the  meaning of doctrines and of their evidence. The school disputations of  the middle ages had a somewhat similar object. They were intended to  make sure that the pupil understood his own opinion, and (by necessary  correlation) the opinion opposed to it, and could enforce the grounds of  the one and confute those of the other. These last-mentioned contests  had indeed the incurable defect, that the premises appealed to were  taken from authority, not from reason; and, as a discipline to the mind,  they were in every respect inferior to the powerful dialectics which  formed the intellects of the \"Socratici viri\": but the modern mind owes  far more to both than it is generally willing to admit, and the present  modes of education contain nothing which in the smallest degree supplies  the place either of the one or of the other. A person who derives all  his instruction from teachers or books, even if he escape the besetting  temptation of contenting himself with cram, is under no compulsion to  hear both sides; accordingly it is far from a frequent accomplishment,  even among thinkers, to know both sides; and the weakest part of what  everybody says in defence of his opinion, is what he intends as a reply  to antagonists. It is the fashion of the present time to disparage  negative logic--that which points out weaknesses in theory or errors in  practice, without establishing positive truths. Such negative criticism  would indeed be poor enough as an ultimate result; but as a means to  attaining any positive knowledge or conviction worthy the name, it  cannot be valued too highly; and until people are again systematically  trained to it, there will be few great thinkers, and a low general  average of intellect, in any but the mathematical and physical  departments of speculation. On any other subject no one's opinions  deserve the name of knowledge, except so far as he has either had  forced upon him by "]]]
