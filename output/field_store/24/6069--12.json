The persistence of the myths  is accounted for by the well-known conservatism of the religious  sentiment--a conservatism noticed even by Eusebius. \"In later days, when  they became ashamed of the religious beliefs of their ancestors, they  invented private and respectful interpretations, each to suit himself.  For no one dared to shake the ancestral beliefs, as they honoured at a  very high rate the sacredness and antiquity of old associations, and of  the teaching they had received in childhood.\"(1)      (1) Praep. E., ii. 6, 19.      Thus the method which we propose to employ is in harmony both with  modern scientific procedure and with the views of a clear-sighted Father  of the Church. Consequently no system could well be less \"heretical\" and  \"unorthodox\".    The last advantage of our hypothesis which need here be mentioned is  that it helps to explain the DIFFUSION no less than the ORIGIN of the  wild and crazy element in myth. We seek for the origin of the savage  factor of myth in one aspect of the intellectual condition of savages.  We say \"in one aspect\" expressly; to guard against the suggestion that  the savage intellect has no aspect but this, and no saner ideas than  those of myth. The DIFFUSION of stories practically identical in every  quarter of the globe may be (provisionally) regarded as the result of  the prevalence in every quarter, at one time or another, of similar  mental habits and ideas. This explanation must not be pressed too hard  nor too far. If we find all over the world a belief that men can change  themselves and their neighbours into beasts, that belief will account  for the appearance of metamorphosis in myth. If we find a belief that  inanimate objects are really much on a level with man, the opinion  will account for incidents of myth such as that in which the wooden  figure-head of the Argo speaks with a human voice. Again, a widespread  belief in the separability of the soul or the life from the body will  account for the incident in nursery tales and myths of the \"giant who  had no heart in his body,\" but kept his heart and life elsewhere. An  ancient identity of mental status and the working of similar mental  forces at the attempt to explain the same phenomena will account,  without any theory of borrowing, or transmission of myth, or of  original unity of race, for the world-wide diffusion of many mythical  conceptions.    But this theory of the original similarity of the savage mind everywhere  and in all races will scarcely account for the world-wide distribution  of long and intricate mythical PLOTS, of consecutive series of adroitly  interwoven situations. In presence of these long romances, found among  so many widely severed peoples, conjecture is, at present, almost  idle. We do not know, in many instances, whether such stories were  independently developed, or carried from a common centre, or borrowed by  one race from another, and so handed on round the world.    This chapter may conclude with an example of a tale whose DIFFUSION may  be explained in divers ways, though its ORIGIN seems undoubtedly savage.  If we turn to the Algonkins, a stock of Red Indians, we come on a  popular tradition which really does give pause to the mythologist. Could  this story, he asks himself, have been separately invented in widely  different places, or could the Iroquois have borrowed from the  Australian blacks or the Andaman Islanders? It is a common thing in most  mythologies to find everything of value to man--fire, sun, water--in  the keeping of some hostile power. The fire, or the sun, or the water  is then stolen, or in other ways rescued from the enemy and restored  to humanity. The Huron story (as far as water is concerned) is told by  Father Paul Le Jeune, a Jesuit missionary, who lived among the Hurons  about 1636. The myth begins with the usual opposition between two  brothers, the Cain and Abel of savage legend. One of the brothers, named  Ioskeha, slew the other, and became the father of mankind (as known  to the Red Indians) and the guardian of the Iroquois. The earth was at  first arid and sterile, but Ioskeha destroyed the gigantic frog which  had swallowed all the waters, and guided the torrents into smooth  streams and lakes.(1)      (1) Relations de la Nouvelle France, 1636, p. 103 (Paris, Cramoisy,  1637).      Now where, outside of North America, do we find this frog who swallowed  all the water? We find him in Australia.    \"The aborigines of Lake Tyers,\" remarks Mr. Brough Smyth, \"say that at  one time there was no water anywhere on the face of the earth. All the  waters were contained in the body of a huge frog, and men and women  could get none of them. A council was held, and... it was agreed that  the frog should be made to laugh, when the waters would run out of his  mouth, and there would be plenty in all parts.\"    To make a long story short, all the animals played the jester before  the gigantic solemn frog, who sat as grave as Louis XV. \"I do not like  buffoons who don't make me laugh,\" said that majestical monarch. At last  the eel danced on the tip of his tail, and the gravity of the prodigious  Batrachian gave way. He laughed till he literally split his sides,  and the imprisoned waters came with a rush. Indeed, many persons were  drowned, though this is not the only Australian version of the Deluge.    The Andaman Islanders dwell at a very considerable distance from  Australia and from the Iroquois, and, in the present condition of the  natives of Australia and Andaman, neither could possibly visit the  other. The frog in the Andaman version is called a toad, and he came to  swallow the waters in the following way: One day a woodpecker was eating  honey high up in the boughs of a tree. Far below, the toad was a witness  of the feast, and asked for some honey. \"Well, come up here, and you  shall have some,\" said the woodpecker. \"But how am I to climb?\" \"Take  hold of that creeper, and I will draw you up,\" said the woodpecker; but  all the while he was bent on a practical joke. So the toad got into a  bucket he happened to possess, and fastened the bucket to the creeper.  \"Now, pull!\" Then the woodpecker raised the toad slowly to the level of  the bough where the honey was, and presently let him down with a run,  not only disappointing the poor toad, but shaking him severely. The toad  went away in a rage and looked about him for revenge. A happy thought  occurred to him, and he drank up all the water of the rivers and lakes.  Birds and beasts were perishing, woodpeckers among them, of thirst. The  toad, overjoyed at his success, wished to add insult to the injury, and,  very thoughtlessly, began to dance in an irritating manner at his foes.  But then the stolen waters gushed out of his mouth in full volume, and  the drought soon ended. One of the most curious points in this myth is  the origin of the quarrel between the woodpecker and the toad. The same  beginning--the tale of an insult put on an animal by hauling up and  letting him down with a run--occurs in an African Marchen.(1)      (1) Brough Smyth, Aborigines of Victoria, i. 429, 430; Brinton, American  Hero Myths, i. 55. Cf. also Relations de la Nouvelle France, 1636, 1640,  1671; (Sagard, Hist. du Canada, 1636, p. 451;) Journal Anthrop. Inst.,  1881.      Now this strangely diffused story of the slaying of the frog which had  swallowed all the water seems to be a savage myth of which the more  heroic conflict of Indra with Vrittra (the dragon which had swallowed  all the waters) is an epic and sublimer version.(1) \"The heavenly water,  which Vrittra withholds from the world, is usually the prize of the  contest.\"      (1) Ludwig, Der Rig-Veda, iii. p. 337. See postea, \"Divine Myths of  India\".      The serpent of Vedic myth is, perhaps, rather the robber-guardian than  the swallower of the waters, but Indra is still, like the Iroquois  Ioskeha, \"he who wounds the full one\".(1) This example of the wide  distribution of a myth shows how the question of diffusion, though  connected with, is yet distinct from that of origin. The advantage  of our method will prove to be, that it discovers an historical and  demonstrable state of mind as the origin of the wild element in  myth. Again, the wide prevalence in the earliest times of this mental  condition will, to a certain extent, explain the DISTRIBUTION of  myth. Room must be left, of course, for processes of borrowing and  transmission, but how Andamanese, Australians and Hurons could borrow  from each other is an unsolved problem.      (1) Gubernatis, Zoological Myth. ii. 395, note 2. \"When Indra kills the  serpent he opens the torrent of the waters\" (p. 393). See also Aitareya  Brahmana, translated by Haug, ii. 483.      Finally, our hypothesis is not involved in dubious theories of race. To  us, myths appear to be affected (in their origins) much less by the race  than by the stage of culture attained by the people who cherish them.  A fight for the waters between a monstrous dragon like Vrittra and a  heroic god like Indra is a nobler affair than a quarrel for the  waters between a woodpecker and a toad. But the improvement and  transfiguration, so to speak, of a myth at bottom the same is due to the  superior culture, not to the peculiar race, of the Vedic poets, except  so far as culture itself depends on race. How far the purer culture was  attained to by the original superiority of the Aryan over the Andaman  breed, it is not necessary for our purpose to inquire. Thus, on the  whole, we may claim for our system a certain demonstrable character,  which helps to simplify the problems of mythology, and to remove  them from the realm of fanciful guesses and conflicting etymological  conjectures into that of sober "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2833"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 1 (#13)"],[1,"for something better. It  occurred to me that it would be a kindness to take her about and  introduce her to the world. She thinks she knows a great deal of  it--like most American girls; but like most American girls she's  ridiculously mistaken. If you want to know, I thought she would do me  credit. I like to be well thought of, and for a woman of my age there's  no greater convenience, in some ways, than an attractive niece. You  know I had seen nothing of my sister's children for years; I disapproved  entirely of the father. But I always meant to do something for them when  he should have gone to his reward. I ascertained where they were to be  found and, without any preliminaries, went and introduced myself. There  are two others of them, both of whom are married; but I saw only the  elder, who has, by the way, a very uncivil husband. The wife, whose name  is Lily, jumped at the idea of my taking an interest in Isabel; she  said it was just what her sister needed--that some one should take  an interest in her. She spoke of her as you might speak of some young  person of genius--in want of encouragement and patronage. It may be that  Isabel's a genius; but in that case I've not yet learned her special  line. Mrs. Ludlow was especially keen about my taking her to Europe;  they all regard Europe over there as a land of emigration, of rescue, a  refuge for their superfluous population. Isabel herself seemed very  glad to come, and the thing was easily arranged. There was a little  difficulty about the money-question, as she seemed averse to being  under pecuniary obligations. But she has a small income and she supposes  herself to be travelling at her own expense.\"    Ralph had listened attentively to this judicious report, by which his  interest in the subject of it was not impaired. \"Ah, if she's a genius,\"  he said, \"we must find out her special line. Is it by chance for  flirting?\"    \"I don't think so. You may suspect that at first, but you'll be wrong.  You won't, I think, in any way, be easily right about her.\"    \"Warburton's wrong then!\" Ralph rejoicingly exclaimed. \"He flatters  himself he has made that discovery.\"    His mother shook her head. \"Lord Warburton won't understand her. He  needn't try.\"    \"He's very intelligent,\" said Ralph; \"but it's right he should be  puzzled once in a while.\"    \"Isabel will enjoy puzzling a lord,\" Mrs. Touchett remarked.    Her son frowned a little. \"What does she know about lords?\"    \"Nothing at all: that will puzzle him all the more.\"    Ralph greeted these words with a laugh and looked out of the window.  Then, \"Are you not going down to see my father?\" he asked.    \"At a quarter to eight,\" said Mrs. Touchett.    Her son looked at his watch. \"You've another quarter of an hour then.  Tell me some more about Isabel.\" After which, as Mrs. Touchett declined  his invitation, declaring that he must find out for himself, \"Well,\" he  pursued, \"she'll certainly do you credit. But won't she also give you  trouble?\"    \"I hope not; but if she does I shall not shrink from it. I never do  that.\"    \"She strikes me as very natural,\" said Ralph.    \"Natural people are not the most trouble.\"    \"No,\" said Ralph; \"you yourself are a proof of that. You're extremely  natural, and I'm sure you have never troubled any one. It takes trouble  to do that. But tell me this; it just occurs to me. Is Isabel capable of  making herself disagreeable?\"    \"Ah,\" cried his mother, \"you ask too many questions! Find that out for  yourself.\"    His questions, however, were not exhausted. \"All this time,\" he said,  \"you've not told me what you intend to do with her.\"    \"Do with her? You talk as if she were a yard of calico. I shall do  absolutely nothing with her, and she herself will do everything she  chooses. She gave me notice of that.\"    \"What you meant then, in your telegram, was that her character's  independent.\"    \"I never know what I mean in my telegrams--especially those I send from  America. Clearness is too expensive. Come down to your father.\"    \"It's not yet a quarter to eight,\" said Ralph.    \"I must allow for his impatience,\" Mrs. Touchett answered. Ralph knew  what to think of his father's impatience; but, making no rejoinder, he  offered his mother his arm. This put it in his power, as they  descended together, to stop her a moment on the middle landing of the  staircase--the broad, low, wide-armed staircase of time-blackened oak  which was one of the most striking features of Gardencourt. \"You've no  plan of marrying her?\" he smiled.    \"Marrying her? I should be sorry to play her such a trick! But apart  from that, she's perfectly able to marry herself. She has every  facility.\"    \"Do you mean to say she has a husband picked out?\"    \"I don't know about a husband, but there's a young man in Boston--!\"    Ralph went on; he had no desire to hear about the young man in Boston.  \"As my father says, they're always engaged!\"    His mother had told him that he must satisfy his curiosity at the  source, and it soon became evident he should not want for occasion. He  had a good deal of talk with his young kinswoman when the two had been  left together in the drawing-room. Lord Warburton, who had ridden over  from his own house, some ten miles distant, remounted and took his  departure before dinner; and an hour after this meal was ended Mr. and  Mrs. Touchett, who appeared to have quite emptied the measure of their  forms, withdrew, under the valid pretext of fatigue, to their respective  apartments. The young man spent an hour with his cousin; though she had  been travelling half the day she appeared in no degree spent. She was  really tired; she knew it, and knew she should pay for it on the morrow;  but it was her habit at this period to carry exhaustion to the furthest  point and confess to it only when dissimulation broke down. A fine  hypocrisy was for the present possible; she was interested; she was, as  she said to herself, floated. She asked Ralph to show her the pictures;  there were a great many in the house, most of them of his own choosing.  The best were arranged in an oaken gallery, of charming proportions,  which had a sitting-room at either end of it and which in the evening  was usually lighted. The light was insufficient to show the pictures  to advantage, and the visit might have stood over to the morrow.  This suggestion Ralph had ventured to make; but Isabel looked  disappointed--smiling still, however--and said: \"If you please I should  like to see them just a little.\" She was eager, she knew she was eager  and now seemed so; she couldn't help it. \"She doesn't take suggestions,\"  Ralph said to himself; but he said it without irritation; her pressure  amused and even pleased him. The lamps were on brackets, at intervals,  and if the light was imperfect it was genial. It fell upon the vague  squares of rich colour and on the faded gilding of heavy frames; it made  a sheen on the polished floor of the gallery. Ralph took a candlestick  and moved about, pointing out the things he liked; Isabel, inclining to  one picture after another, indulged in little exclamations and murmurs.  She was evidently a judge; she had a natural taste; he was struck with  that. She took a candlestick herself and held it slowly here and there;  she lifted it high, and as she did so he found himself pausing in the  middle of the place and bending his eyes much less upon the pictures  than on her presence. He lost nothing, in truth, by these wandering  glances, for she was better worth looking at than most works of art.  She was undeniably spare, and ponderably light, and proveably tall; when  people had wished to distinguish her from the other two Miss Archers  they had always called her the willowy one. Her hair, which was dark  even to blackness, had been an object of envy to many women; her light  grey eyes, a little too firm perhaps in her graver moments, had an  enchanting range of concession. They walked slowly up one side of the  gallery and down the other, and then she said: \"Well, now I know more  than I did when I began!\"    \"You apparently have a great passion for knowledge,\" her cousin  returned.    \"I think I have; most girls are horridly ignorant.\"    \"You strike me as different from most girls.\"    \"Ah, some of them would--but the way they're talked to!\" murmured  Isabel, who preferred not to dilate just yet on herself. Then in a  moment, to change the subject, \"Please tell me--isn't there a ghost?\"  she went on.    \"A ghost?\"    \"A castle-spectre, a thing that appears. We call them ghosts in  America.\"    \"So we do here, when we see them.\"    \"You do see them then? You ought to, in this romantic old house.\"    \"It's not a romantic old house,\" said Ralph. \"You'll be disappointed if  you count on that. It's a dismally prosaic one; there's no romance here  but what you may have brought with you.\"    \"I've brought a great deal; but it seems to me I've brought it to the  right place.\"    \"To keep it out of harm, certainly; nothing will ever happen to it here,  between my father and me.\"    Isabel looked at him a moment. \"Is there never any one here but your  father and you?\"    \"My mother, of course.\"    \"Oh, I know your mother; she's not romantic. Haven't you other people?\"    \"Very few.\"    \"I'm sorry for that; I like so much to see people.\"    \"Oh, we'll invite all the county to amuse you,\" said Ralph.    \"Now you're making fun of me,\" the girl answered rather gravely. \"Who  was the gentleman on the lawn when I arrived?\"    \"A county neighbour; he doesn't come very often.\"    \"I'm sorry for that; I liked him,\" said Isabel.    \"Why, it seemed to me that you barely spoke to him,\" Ralph objected.    \"Never mind, I like him all the same. I like your father too,  immensely.\"    \"You can't do better than that. He's the dearest of the dear.\"    \"I'm so sorry he is ill,\" said Isabel.    \"You must help me to nurse him; you ought to be a good nurse.\"    \"I don't think I am; "]]]
