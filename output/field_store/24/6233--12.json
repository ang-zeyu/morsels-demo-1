But hills and hill people are not  easily sophisticated; and if you walk out here on a summer Sunday, it is  as like as not the shepherd may set his dogs upon you.  But keep an  unmoved countenance; they look formidable at the charge, but their hearts  are in the right place, and they will only bark and sprawl about you on  the grass, unmindful of their master's excitations.    Kirk Yetton forms the north-eastern angle of the range; thence, the  Pentlands trend off to south and west.  From the summit you look over a  great expanse of champaign sloping to the sea, and behold a large variety  of distant hills.  There are the hills of Fife, the hills of Peebles, the  Lammermoors and the Ochils, more or less mountainous in outline, more or  less blue with distance.  Of the Pentlands themselves, you see a field of  wild heathery peaks with a pond gleaming in the midst; and to that side  the view is as desolate as if you were looking into Galloway or  Applecross.  To turn to the other is like a piece of travel.  Far out in  the lowlands Edinburgh shows herself, making a great smoke on clear days  and spreading her suburbs about her for miles; the Castle rises darkly in  the midst, and close by, Arthur's Seat makes a bold figure in the  landscape.  All around, cultivated fields, and woods, and smoking  villages, and white country roads, diversify the uneven surface of the  land.  Trains crawl slowly abroad upon the railway lines; little ships  are tacking in the Firth; the shadow of a mountainous cloud, as large as  a parish, travels before the wind; the wind itself ruffles the wood and  standing corn, and sends pulses of varying colour across the landscape.  So you sit, like Jupiter upon Olympus, and look down from afar upon men's  life.  The city is as silent as a city of the dead: from all its humming  thoroughfares, not a voice, not a footfall, reaches you upon the hill.  The sea-surf, the cries of ploughmen, the streams and the mill-wheels,  the birds and the wind, keep up an animated concert through the plain;  from farm to farm, dogs and crowing cocks contend together in defiance;  and yet from this Olympian station, except for the whispering rumour of a  train, the world has fallen into a dead silence, and the business of town  and country grown voiceless in your ears.  A crying hill-bird, the bleat  of a sheep, a wind singing in the dry grass, seem not so much to  interrupt, as to accompany, the stillness; but to the spiritual ear, the  whole scene makes a music at once human and rural, and discourses  pleasant reflections on the destiny of man.  The spiry habitable city,  ships, the divided fields, and browsing herds, and the straight highways,  tell visibly of man's active and comfortable ways; and you may be never  so laggard and never so unimpressionable, but there is something in the  view that spirits up your blood and puts you in the vein for cheerful  labour.    Immediately below is Fairmilehead, a spot of roof and a smoking chimney,  where two roads, no thicker than packthread, intersect beside a hanging  wood.  If you are fanciful, you will be reminded of the gauger in the  story.  And the thought of this old exciseman, who once lipped and  fingered on his pipe and uttered clear notes from it in the mountain air,  and the words of the song he affected, carry your mind 'Over the hills  and far away' to distant countries; and you have a vision of Edinburgh  not, as you see her, in the midst of a little neighbourhood, but as a  boss upon the round world with all Europe and the deep sea for her  surroundings.  For every place is a centre to the earth, whence highways  radiate or ships set sail for foreign ports; the limit of a parish is not  more imaginary than the frontier of an empire; and as a man sitting at  home in his cabinet and swiftly writing books, so a city sends abroad an  influence and a portrait of herself.  There is no Edinburgh emigrant, far  or near, from China to Peru, but he or she carries some lively pictures  of the mind, some sunset behind the Castle cliffs, some snow scene, some  maze of city lamps, indelible in the memory and delightful to study in  the intervals of toil.  For any such, if this book fall in their way,  here are a few more home pictures.  It would be pleasant, if they should  recognise a house where they had dwelt, or a walk that they had taken.                                    * * * * *                                    * * * * *                                      LONDON      Printed by STRANGEWAYS and Sons, Tower St.  Cambridge Circus, W.C.

It is not their fault it the city calls  for something more specious by way of inhabitants.  A man in a frock-coat  looks out of place upon an Alp or Pyramid, although he has the virtues of  a Peabody and the talents of a Bentham.  And let them console  themselves--they do as well as anybody else; the population of (let us  say) Chicago would cut quite as rueful a figure on the same romantic  stage.

Nay,  it seems to me possible, if not probable, that some larvae which do not  now breed may, in the course of ages, acquire the power of doing so. If  this idea is correct, it shows how the remarkable phenomenon, known as  alternation of generations, may have originated.    Summing up, then, the preceding argument, we find among insects various  modes of development; from simple growth on the one hand, to well-marked  instances of the so-called alternation of generation on the other. In  the wingless species of Orthoptera there is little external difference,  excepting in size, between the young larva and the perfect insect. The  growth is gradual, and there is nothing which would, in ordinary  language, be called a metamorphosis. In the majority of Orthoptera,  though the presence of wings produces a marked difference between the  larva and the imago, the habits are nearly the same throughout life, and  consequently the action of external circumstances affects the larva in  the same manner as it does the perfect insect.    This is not the case with the Neuroptera. The larvae do not live under  the same conditions as the perfect insects: external forces accordingly  affect them in a different manner; and we have seen that they pass  through some changes which bear no reference to the form of the perfect  insect: these changes, however, are for the most part very gradual. The  caterpillars of Lepidoptera have even more extensive modifications to  undergo; the mouth of the larva, for instance, being remarkably unlike  that of the perfect insect. A change in this organ, however, could  hardly take place while the insect was growing fast, and consequently  feeding voraciously; nor, even if the change could be thus effected,  would the mouth, in its intermediate stages, be in any way fitted for  biting and chewing leaves. The same reasoning applies also to the  digestive organs. Hence the caterpillar undergoes little, if any,  change, except in size, and the metamorphosis is concentrated, so to  say, into the last two moults. The changes then become so rapid and  extensive, that the intermediate period is necessarily one of  quiescence. In some exceptional cases, as in _Sitaris_ (_ante_, p. 30) we  even find that, the conditions of life not being uniform throughout the  larval period, the larva itself undergoes metamorphoses.    Owing to the fact that the organs connected with the reproduction of the  species come to maturity at a late period, larvae are generally incapable  of breeding. There are, however, some flies which have viviparous larvae,  and thus offer a typical case of alternation of generations.    Thus, then, we find among insects every gradation, from simple growth to  alternation of generations; and see how, from the single fact of the  very early period of development at which certain animals quit the egg,  we can throw some light on their metamorphoses, and for the still more  remarkable phenomenon that, among many of the lower animals, the species  is represented by two very different forms. We may even conclude, from  the same considerations, that this phenomenon may in the course of ages  become still more common than it is at present. As long, however, as the  external organs arrive at their mature form before the internal  generative organs are fully developed, we have metamorphosis; but if the  reverse is the case, then alternation of generations often results.    The same considerations throw much light on the remarkable circumstance,  that in alternation of generations the reproduction is, as a general  rule, agamic in one form. This results from the fact that reproduction  by distinct sexes requires the perfection both of the external and  internal organs; and if the phenomenon arise, as has just been  suggested, from the fact that the internal organs arrive at maturity  before the external ones, reproduction will result in those species only  which have the power of agamic multiplication.    Moreover, it is evident that we have in the animal kingdom two kinds of  dimorphism.    This term has usually been applied to those cases in which animals or  plants present themselves at maturity under two forms. Ants and Bees  afford us familiar instances among animals; and among plants the  interesting case of the genus _Primula_ has recently been described by  Mr. Darwin. Even more recently he has made known to us the still more  remarkable phenomenon afforded by the genus _Lythrum_, in which there  are three distinct forms, and which therefore offers an instance of  polymorphism.[51]    The other kind of dimorphism or polymorphism differs from the first in  being the result of the differentiating action of external  circumstances, not on the mature, but on the young individual. Such  different forms, therefore, stand towards one another in the relation of  succession. In the first kind the chain of being divides at the  extremity; in the other it is composed of dissimilar links. Many  instances of this second form of dimorphism have been described under  the name of alternation of generations.    The term, however, has met with much opposition, and is clearly  inapplicable to the differences exhibited by insects in various periods  of their life. Strictly speaking, the phenomena are frequently not  alternate, and in the opinion of some eminent naturalists they are not,  strictly speaking, cases of generation at all.[52]    In order, then, to have some name for these remarkable phenomena, and to  distinguish them from those cases in which the _mature_ animal or plant  is represented by two or more different forms, I think it would be  convenient to retain exclusively for these latter the terms dimorphism  and polymorphism; and those cases in which animals or plants pass  through a succession of different forms might be distinguished by the  name of dieidism or polyeidism.    The conclusions, then, which I think we may draw from the preceding  considerations, are:--    1. That the occurrence of metamorphoses arises from the immaturity of  the condition in which some animals quit the egg.    2. That the form of the insect larva depends in great measure on the  conditions in which it lives. The external forces acting upon it are  different from those which affect the mature form; and thus changes are  produced in the young, having reference to its immediate wants, rather  than to its final form.    3. That metamorphoses may therefore be divided into two kinds,  developmental and adaptional or adaptive.    4. That the apparent abruptness of the changes which insects undergo,  arises in great measure from the hardness of their skin, which admits of  no gradual alteration of form, and which is itself necessary in order to  afford sufficient support to the muscles.    5. The immobility of the pupa or chrysalis depends on the rapidity of  the changes going on in it.    6. Although the majority of insects go through three well-marked stages  after leaving the egg, still a large number arrive at maturity through a  greater or smaller number of slight changes.    7. When the external organs arrive at this final form before the organs  of reproduction are matured, these changes are known as metamorphoses;  when, on the contrary, the organs of reproduction are functionally  perfect before the external organs, or when the creature has the power  of budding, then the phenomenon is known as alternation of generations.          CHAPTER V.    _ON THE ORIGIN OF INSECTS._      \"Personne,\" says Carl Vogt, \"en Europe au moins, n'ose plus soutenir la  Creation independante et de toutes pieces des especes,\" and though this  statement is perhaps not strictly correct, still it is no doubt true,  that the Doctrine of Evolution, in some form or other, is accepted by  most, if not by all, the greatest naturalists of Europe. Yet it is  surprising how much, in spite of all that has been written, Mr. Darwin's  views are still misunderstood. Thus Browning, in one of his recent  poems, says:--      \"That mass man sprang from was a jelly lump     Once on a time; he kept an after course     Through fish and insect, reptile, bird, and beast,     Till he attained to be an ape at last,     Or last but one.\"[53]    This theory, though it would be regarded by many as a fair statement of  his views, is one which Mr. Darwin would entirely repudiate. Whether  fish and insect, reptile, bird and beast, are derived from one original  stock or not, they are certainly not links in one sequence. I do not,  however, propose to discuss the question of Natural Selection, but may  observe that it is one thing to acknowledge that in Natural Selection,  or the survival of the fittest, Mr. Darwin has called attention to a  _vera causa_, has pointed out the true explanation of certain phenomena;  but it is quite another thing to maintain that all animals are descended  from some primordial source.    For my own part, I am satisfied that Natural Selection is a true cause,  and, whatever may be the final result of our present inquiries--whether  animated nature be derived from one ancestral source, or from many--the  publication of the Origin of Species will none the less have constituted  an epoch in the History of Biology. But, how far the present condition  of living beings is due to that cause; how far, on the other hand, the  action of Natural Selection has been modified and checked by other  natural laws--by the unalterability of types, by atavism, &c.; how many  types of life originally came into being; and whether they arose  simultaneously or successively,--these and many other similar questions  remain unsolved, even admitting the theory of Natural Selection. All  this has indeed been clearly pointed out by Mr. Darwin himself, and  would not need repetition but for the careless criticism by which in too  many cases the true question has been obscured. Without, however,  discussing the argument for and against Mr. Darwin's conclusions, so "]]]
