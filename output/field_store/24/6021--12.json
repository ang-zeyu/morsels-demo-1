Amadon and Phillips (1947:578) reported a nest of _Auriparus flaviceps_  at Las Delicias. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:197) obtained a single  specimen \"in an arroyo a few miles east of Saltillo\" and a single  specimen \"about twenty miles west\" of Saltillo. Ridgway (1904:421)  reported _A. f. ornatus_ [he referred to it as _A. f. flaviceps_] at  Monclova. Hellmayr (1934:88) listed _A. f. ornatus_ from Jaral. Findley  saw a Verdin 2 mi. S and 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas on June 22, 1952.    The size (wing, 50 mm.; tail, 43 mm.) of No. 31056 is small for typical  representatives of _A. f. ornatus_. The yellow of the head of No. 31056  is darker than that of the other subspecies of the Verdin, and I have  accordingly allocated the specimen to _A. f. ornatus_.    *_Psaltriparus melanotis lloydi_ Sennett.--_Specimens examined:_ total  5: [Male] 31058 and [Female] 31057 from 37 mi. S, 21 mi. E Boquillas,  4100 ft., March 13, 1952; [Male] 31060 and [Female] 31059 from Sierra  de la Encantada (=38 mi. S, 23 mi. E Boquillas), 4400 ft., March 15,  1952; and [Male] 35407 (skeleton only) from Sierra del Pino (=5 mi. W,  3 mi. S Acebuches), 6200 ft., May 14, 1954.    The Black-eared Bushtit is common in Coahuila. Typical representatives  of _P. m. lloydi_ in the northern part of the State range from 4100  feet to 8000 feet. Miller (1955a:168-169) reported _P. m. lloydi_  breeding in the Sierra del Carmen. Marsh and Stevenson (1938:287)  obtained a male in the Sierra del Carmen at El Jardin. The size of the  testes (3.5 mm.) of No. 31058 suggests breeding by the Black-eared  Bushtit 37 mi. S and 21 mi. E Boquillas.    **_Psaltriparus melanotis iulus_ Jouy.--_Specimens examined:_ total 2:  [Male] 31659 from the north slope of Sierra Guadalupe (=10 mi. S, 7 mi.  W General Cepeda), 7000 ft., April 20, 1953; and [Female] 31658 from  the north slope of Sierra Guadalupe (=10 mi. S, 5 mi. W General  Cepeda), 6700 ft., April 15, 1953.    Typical representatives of this Black-eared Bushtit are present in the  southeastern sector of Coahuila. The backs of Nos. 31658-31659 differ  slightly in color from the backs of typical representatives of  _lloydi_. I suspect that the specimens from the Sierra Guadalupe are  intergrades between _lloydi_ and _iulus_.    Burleigh and Lowery (1942:197) took two males and two females of  _Psaltriparus melanotis iulus_ (they called their specimens  _Psaltriparus minimus iulus_) at Saltillo and stated that their  specimens tended to approach _lloydi_ rather than being typical  _iulus_. Sutton and Burleigh (1939a:36) recorded _P. m. iulus_ only at  Diamante Pass where they took two specimens.    *_Sitta carolinensis nelsoni_ Mearns.--Miller (1955a:169) reported that  this subspecies of the White-breasted Nuthatch breeds and was common in  the oaks and open conifers from 6500 to 8000 feet in the Sierra del  Carmen and stated also that the populations of the White-breasted  Nuthatch in \"the Chisos Mountains [of Texas] and the Sierra del Carmen  seem best regarded as a stage in the cline of which _nelsoni_ and  _mexicana_ are end points, although falling closer to _nelsoni_.\"    *_Sitta carolinensis mexicana_ Nelson and Palmer.--_Specimens  examined:_ total 2: [Male] 31669 and [Female] 31670 from the Canyon d.  Meco, Sierra Guadalupe (=10 mi. S General Cepeda), 6500 ft., April 23,  1953, weights, 17, 18 gms.    Typical populations of this White-breasted Nuthatch occur in southern  Coahuila. Ridgway (1904:449) listed _S. c. mexicana_ from Sierra  Guadalupe in southern Coahuila. The underparts of our specimens are  darker than in _nelsoni_, and their bills (culmen, 15, 13 mm.) are  shorter than the average ([Male], 19.8 mm.; [Female], 18.6 mm.  [Ridgway, 1904:447]) in _nelsoni_. The large size of the testes (5x3  mm.) of No. 31669 suggests breeding by _S. c. mexicana_ in Sierra  Guadalupe.    *_Sitta pygmaea melanotis_ van Rossem.--In Coahuila the Pigmy Nuthatch  seems to be locally common. Miller (1955a:169) reported it so between  7500 and 8000 feet in pine-oak on the mesa tops and in the heads of  canyons of the Sierra del Carmen and noted that it breeds there. Hardy  saw the Pigmy Nuthatch 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas on July 6,  1955.    _Certhia familiaris americana_ Bonaparte.--_Specimens examined:_ total  2: [Female] 31612 from the base of Don Martin Dam, November 27, 1953,  skull partially unossified; and [Female] 31587 from 20 mi. S Ocampo,  6500 ft., April 5, 1954, weight, 7 gms.    This subspecies of the Brown Creeper can be considered a sparse winter  visitant to Coahuila. Van Hoose (1955:302) reported that Nos. 31612 and  31587 constitute the southernmost records of _C. f. americana_ and  represent the first records of occurrence of _americana_ in Mexico.    _Certhia familiaris montana_ Ridgway.--Miller (1955a:169) reported this  subspecies of the Brown Creeper, which he assumed to be a winter  visitant or a migrant, in the Sierra del Carmen. He (_loc. cit._)  remarked also that the higher conifers would seem to constitute  favorable habitat for nesting by the Brown Creeper, but did not find  any evidence of a breeding population of creepers in the Sierra del  Carmen. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:143) reported _C.  f. montana_ from San Lazaro Mountain on November 9.    **_Certhia familiaris albescens_ Berlepsch.--_Specimens examined:_  total 3: sex ? 32805 from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, July 7,  1955; [Male] [Male] 31610-31611 from 3 mi. S, 13 mi. E San Antonio de  las Alazanas, 8900 ft., January 12, 1954.    Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:143) reported _C. f.  albescens_ from \"southern Coahuila.\" Nos. 31610-31611 and 32805  represent the only other records of this subspecies from the State. The  date (July 7) on which No. 32805 was obtained suggests that this bird  was a resident 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas.    _Troglodytes aedon parkmanii_ Audubon.--_Specimen examined:_ one, sex ?  29556, from 1.5 mi. N Parras, 5500 ft., November 10, 1949, weight, 9.8  gms.    Burleigh and Lowery (1942:197) recorded the House Wren \"in small  numbers about Saltillo where occasional birds, presumably migrants,  were noted in thickets or stretches of underbrush fringing cultivated  fields.\" They obtained a single male \"on the outskirts of Saltillo.\"  Hellmayr (1934:218) listed _T. a. parkmanii_ from Sabinas.    *_Troglodytes brunneicollis cahooni_ Brewster.--Typical representatives  of this subspecies of the Brown-throated Wren occur in northern  Coahuila. In the Sierra del Carmen, Miller (1955a:170) found _T. b.  cahooni_ that in no way suggested _compositus_ of the Sierra Madre  Oriental. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:198) recorded a _cahooni_-like  specimen from Diamante Pass in southern Coahuila.    **_Troglodytes brunneicollis compositus_ Griscom.--_Specimen examined:_  one, [Male] 32819, from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, July 6,  1955.    The subspecies _cahooni_ and _compositus_ of the Brown-throated Wren  seem to intergrade in the southern part of the State. Although No.  32819 represents the subspecies _compositus_, the somewhat whitish  abdomen and the fairly large spots of the lesser wing coverts suggest  some relationship with _cahooni_. In addition to the present record,  Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:163) recorded _T. b.  compositus_ from southern Coahuila at Sierra Guadalupe. The record of  _T. b. cahooni_ from Sierra Guadalupe (Ridgway, 1904:588) I suspect  probably represents _T. b. compositus_ or an intergrade between  _compositus_ and _cahooni_. The date (July 6) on which No. 32819 was  obtained 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas suggests that this bird  was resident there.    *_Thryomanes bewickii eremophilus_ Oberholser.--_Specimens examined:_  total 3: [Male] 32088 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June 20, 1952;  [Female] 31061 from 4 mi. W Hacienda La Mariposa, 2300 ft., March 24,  1952, weight, 10.8 gms.; and [Male] 31660 from the north foot of Sierra  Guadalupe (=10 mi. S, 5 mi. W General Cepeda), 6500 ft., April 21,  1953, weight, 13 gms.    Bewick's Wren occurs commonly in Coahuila. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom,  and Moore (1957:160) reported that, in Coahuila, _T. b. eremophilus_  \"intergrades in the eastern and southern sections with _T. b. cryptus_  and _T. b. murinus_, respectively.\" The slightly darker coloration of  No. 31660, suggesting a resemblance to _T. b. murinus_, is the only  evidence of intergradation of _T. b. murinus_ and _eremophilus_ that I  have found.    Miller (1955a:170) stated that _T. b. eremophilus_ was \"common in the  piedmont area on yucca-dotted slopes and along the lower canyon walls  in growth of pinon, yucca, and cactus\" in the Sierra del Carmen, and  reported breeding there. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:198) remarked that  _T. b. eremophilus_ \"proved without question to be the most widely  distributed and abundant wren\" in the Saltillo region. The series that  Burleigh and Lowery (_loc. cit._) assembled \"proved to be uniform and  clearly referable to\" _T. b. eremophilus_. Sutton and Burleigh  (1939a:36) noted _Thryomanes bewickii_ at San Pedro on January 29 and  30. Hardy saw a male _T. b. eremophilus_ at Parras on July 4, 1955.  Ridgway (1904:557) listed _T. b. eremophilus_ from Saltillo in April  and as breeding at Sabinas.    The sizes of the testes (8 mm.; 6x4 mm.) of Nos. 32088 and 31660,  respectively, suggest breeding 2 mi. W Jimenez and Sierra Guadalupe.    **_Thryomanes bewickii cryptus_ Oberholser.--Miller, Friedmann,  Griscom, and Moore (1957:161) recorded _T. b. cryptus_ from Saltillo.    *_Thryothorus ludovicianus berlandieri_ Baird.--_Specimens examined:_  total 3: [Male] 32086 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft., June  19, 1952; sex ? 32087 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, June 20, 1952; and [Female]  31063 from 8 mi. N, 4 mi.

Needlecraft  Augusta--Maine          How To Secure Your Yarn Without Cost    The women of America are knitting as never before. In the social set, no  gathering can be fashionable that does not tolerate knitting; the  business woman must needs knit on the car to and from her work; while to  the busy housewife no duty is so imperative as to exclude knitting from  the daily routine. It almost seems as if the women of America--all  women, rich and poor alike--were devoting their united efforts to one  vast universal consecration--the comfort of our boys over there.    There is just one drawback to the fulfilment of this noble ambition that  every woman in America shall devote every spare moment to the knitting  of warm sweaters, stockings, and other comforts for the boys in khaki,  and that is--the tremendously high price of worsted yarns. We can all  squeeze out a little more time but we can none of us spend more money  than we have, and in these times the calls for cash donations are urgent  and not infrequent. But now you can have all the yarn that you will use  without spending any money. A little more time is now the only essential  to your doing your bit for the comfort of those who are offering their  all for our safety. You who have been unable to knit as much as you have  wanted to, because you have lacked the means to do with, need feel that  drawback no longer.
