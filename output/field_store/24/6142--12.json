While on duty he went round the salt pit, near his      beat. Suddenly he felt a prick on his foot, and, suspecting      snakebite, struck out with a bamboo stick he carried in his hand,      and heard the snake make a loud noise. He at once tore a piece of      cloth from his turban, and tied it tightly above the right ankle      joint round the leg, then tried to kill the snake, but could not      do so with certainty, as it was dark. He reported the case to his      superiors, and was carried to the hospital. Bitten at 9.30 p.m.;      admitted at 10.45 p.m.        _Present Symptoms._--Patient was delirious, and could not      understand what was told him; body cold and covered with      perspiration; breathing hurried, with a low rattle at the end of      expiration; mouth, tongue, and palate all dry; tongue leather-like      and cracked, and felt cold; tickling of throat, not exciting      vomiting; pupils dilated; conjunctiva congested; pulse 95; patient      talked, or rather muttered, with difficulty; could not tolerate      strong light or loud noise; the mucous membrane of the mouth      showed irregular dark patches of ecchymosed blood.        The right foot was swollen, and in a line between ankle and      knuckle of big toe showed two punctures--one deep and bleeding,      and surrounded by ecchymosis; the other one below this, more      superficial, the blood oozing thin and not coagulating. Received,      at 10.45 p.m., 1/12th grain of strychnine in left arm. At 11 p.m.,      the same dose; breathing the same, but no rattle; stupor rather      deepening; incoherency increasing. At 11.15, the same dose;      breathing easier; stupor the same; pulse, 85; temp, 97.6;      delirious at times, and moaning with inarticulate cries; could not      hear when spoken to in loud voice. 11.30 p.m., the same dose; no      change in condition. 11.45 p.m., the same dose; stupor now fading      away; delirium present; intolerant to light and noise; peculiar      grin and cramp in face-muscles when attempting to talk; temp,      95.8; pulse very hard; intense thirst; less bleeding from      punctures and blood thicker. 12 p.m., the same dose; no stupor      now, but cramps in lower extremities; no incoherency; only      occasionally uneasy and senseless for a moment, and then rising      suddenly like one startled when sound asleep. 12.30 a.m., no      further symptoms; bleeding stopped; great thirst; eyes red and      glaring; saccharine drinks given; no injection. 3 a.m., no sleep,      but only slight slumber; no pain in foot; no bleeding;      temperature, 98.8; thirst unabated; only drinks given.        _Sept. 14th, 10 a.m._--Better, but talking slightly incoherent;      received another injection of 1/12th grain of strychnine. 6 p.m.,      better; had good appetite; given milk and sago.        _Sept. 15th, 6 a.m._--Better. 6 p.m.--Better; had three motions,      rice and milk diet given, slept soundly between 10 a.m. and 2      p.m., no redness in eyes, swelling of foot abated.        _Sept. 16th._--Better, only complaining of heaviness in head. At 9      p.m. had a fit of stupor all of a sudden, became insensible, and      commenced to bleed again from the mucous membrane of mouth and      nose. The patient became almost insensible, and could only be      roused with difficulty. Twenty minims of liq. strychnine, equal to      1/6th grain, were now injected into the right arm.        _At 9.20_ stupor had passed away and consciousness was fully      restored. From this time onward convalescence was uninterrupted,      and patient was discharged cured on the 20th Sept., 1892.        In his remarks on this case Dr. Banerjee, after reporting that the      snake with back broken in two places was brought to him on the      following day from the exact locality where Rahimudden had been      bitten, gives the following description of it:--Head, large and      triangular; nostrils, large and kidney-shaped; scales, much      imbricate, ventral scales 169, subcaudals 48; confluent, irregular      ring-like, dark brown spots along the back, and with lateral black      patches or rings with white borders. The head marking very      peculiar double V shaped mark, the angle directed between the      nostrils; interstitial coloration, yellowish brown, belly white,      and with brown or amber spots; eyes, large, pupils erect, irides      yellow; body, stout and compressed laterally; poison fangs, large      and recurved, size about half an inch. The length of snake was 3      feet 5 inches, and from these characters it was identified to be      the chain viper (_Duboia Russellii_, _Gray_), the most venomous of      Indian vipers.        The total quantity of the antidote in this case administered was      only 110 minims of a one in 120 solution of strychniae acetas, or      11/12ths of a grain of that drug. Considering the extremely      venomous nature of the snake and the large quantities of      strychnine required in some of the previously reported cases of      echis and bungarus bites, the quantity used seems disproportional,      but this evidently is explained by the fact that only one of the      fangs perforated deeply, and at the back of the foot, probably      struck the bone before entering to its full length, the snake thus      failing to impart the full quantity of venom at its disposal.        The chief interest of Dr. Banerjee's cases centres in the fact      that they are mostly viper-bites. They prove conclusively, as do      Feoktistow's experiments on the lower animals, that the theory of      viper-poison being a blood poison, as asserted in all works on the      subject, is not tenable and must be abandoned. If it effected      changes in the blood, incompatible with life, strychnine, acting      solely on the nerve-centres, could not possibly obliterate these      changes within a few hours or even days. On the other hand the      successful treatment of bungarus bite with strychnine places it      beyond doubt that cobra-poison will also yield to it, if      fearlessly and vigorously applied.        It is most gratifying to the writer to know from good authority      that Sir Joseph Fayrer, the President of the Medical Board at the      India office, has recommended to the English Government the      adoption of the strychnine treatment of snakebite in India, and      that this adoption will not be subject once more to the doubtful      result of experiments on the lower animals, which, according to      newspaper reports, were contemplated at Calcutta as a test. It      would have been deplorable to see more precious time lost in these      experiments, whilst the only proper subjects for experiments, the      unfortunate natives, are perishing by thousands. The step taken by      Sir Joseph Fayrer does honour both to his head and his heart, and      if his recommendation is accepted and vigorously carried out it      will still further increase the debt of gratitude which India owes      to British rule, and with regard to its terrible snake plague, to      the one Englishman who of all others has distinguished himself by      an almost life long study of the subject and indefatigable labours      for its alleviation.    Her Majesty the Queen has also been pleased most graciously to interest  herself in this subject. Memorialised by the writer before Sir J.  Fayrer's recommendation to the British Government, above alluded to, was  known to him, our gracious Sovereign, ever intent on the welfare of her  subjects, has resolved on having the writer's method thoroughly tried in  India, and communicated this her intention to him in a despatch from the  Secretary of State for the Colonies to His Excellency the Governor of  Victoria, dated 11th Nov., 1892, inviting him, at the same time, to  forward any proposals he may have to make direct to the Secretary to the  Government of India in the Home Department; and thus adding one more to  the many noble deeds that mark her benevolent, long, and glorious  reign.          UNSUCCESSFUL CASES.      Considering the newness of the strychnine treatment it would be folly to  expect that the conditions necessary to insure success should have been  observed in every case, and that every practitioner should at once have  made himself familiar with it and the theory on which it is founded.  Hence a few failures were unavoidable. Of these a record has been kept,  but for obvious reasons the writer withholds it here. To give names and  dates would be invidious, though the opponents of the treatment have  exultingly pointed to the few deaths that have occurred as palpable  proofs of its uselessness, some of them even going so far as to ascribe  these deaths to the direct action of the antidote. There is, however,  not a single case on record, in which death took place under  strychnine-convulsions. All the patients died under palpable symptoms of  snakebite-poisoning. As these symptoms have now been proven beyond all  doubt to yield to strychnine, when properly administered, the inference  that it was not so administered in the cases referred to becomes not  only justifiable, but unavoidable. In one case only, that of a child of  tender years, blood was vomited so copiously that death may be ascribed  to that cause and the snake-poison combined, but in all the other six  fatal ones, mostly of children, it was undoubtedly due to the  snake-poison not being properly checked by the antidote.

The result is a thoroughly cooked,  close-grained, crisp biscuit.    Corn pone is made in the same manner with cornmeal as the basis.    [Sidenote: Flapjohn]    Flapjack flour is mixed with water simply; but you will find that a  tablespoonful of sugar not only adds to the flavor, but causes it to  brown crisper. It is equally good baked in loaves. The addition of an  extra spoonful of sugar, two eggs (from your canned desiccated eggs),  raisins and cinnamon makes a delicious camp cake. This is known as  \"flapjohn\"--a sort of sublimated flapjack.    _Puddings._--The general logic of a camp-baked pudding is this:    [Sidenote: How to Make Puddings]    You have first of all your base, which is generally of rice, cornmeal,  or breakfast food previously boiled; second, your filling, which may be  raisins, prunes, figs, or any other dried fruit; third, your sweetening,  which is generally sugar, but may be syrup, honey, or saccharine  tablets; fourth, your seasoning, which must be what you have--cinnamon,  nutmeg, lemon, etc., and last, your coagulating material, which must be  a small portion of your egg powder. With this general notion you can  elaborate.    The portions of materials, inclusive of other chance possessions, the  arrangement of the ingredients determines the naming of the product.  Thus you can mix your fruit all through the pudding, or you can place it  in layers between strata of the mixture.    As an example: Boil one-half cupful of rice with raisins, until soft,  add one-half cupful of sugar, a half spoonful of cinnamon, and a  tablespoonful of egg powder. Add water (water mixed with condensed milk,  if you have it) until quite thin. Bake in moderate heat. Another: Into  two cups of boiling water pour a half cup of cornmeal. Sprinkle it in  slowly, and stir in order to prevent lumps. As soon as it thickens,  which will be in half a minute, remove from the fire. Mix in a quarter  cup of syrup, some figs which have been soaked, a spoonful of egg  powder, milk if you have it, and the flavoring--if you happen to have  tucked in a can of ginger, that is the best. The mixture should be thin.  Bake before moderate fire.    I am not going on to elaborate a number of puddings by name; that is  where the cook-books make their mistake. But with this logical basis,  you will soon invent all sorts of delicious combinations. Some will be  failures, no doubt; but after you get the knack you will be able to  improvise on the least promising materials.    [Sidenote: Experiment Freely in Cooking]    Do not forget that mixing ingredients is always worth trying. A  combination of rice and oatmeal boiled together does not sound very  good, but it is delicious, and quite unlike either of its component  parts. I instance it merely as an example of a dozen similar.    [Sidenote: How to Make Tea]    _Tea._--The usual way of cooking tea is to pour the hot water on the  leaves. If used immediately this is the proper way. When, however, as  almost invariably happens about camp, the water is left standing on the  leaves for some time, the tannin is extracted. This makes a sort of tea  soup, at once bitter and unwholesome. A simple and easy way is to  provide yourself with a piece of cheesecloth about six inches square. On  the center drop your dose of dry tea leaves. Gather up the corners, and  tie into a sort of loose bag. Pour the hot water over this, and at the  end of five minutes fish out the bag. Untie it, shake loose the tea  leaves, and tuck away until next time. The tea in the pot can then be  saved for the late fisherman without fear of lining his stomach with  leather. Also it is no trouble.    [Sidenote: On Coffee]    Coffee, too, is more often bad than good in the field. The usual method  is to put a couple of handfuls in cold water, bring it to a boil, and  then set it aside to settle. Sometimes it is good that way, and  sometimes it isn't. A method that will always succeed, however, is as  follows: Bend an ordinary piece of hay wire into the shape of a hoop,  slightly larger than the mouth of your pot. On it sew a shallow  cheesecloth bag. Put your ground coffee in the bag, suspend in the  coffee pot, and pour the hot water through. If you like it extra strong,  pour it through twice. The result is drip coffee, delicious, and without  grounds. To clean the bag turn it inside out and pour water through.  Then flatten the hay wire hoop slightly and tuck it away inside the pot  with the cups.    _Mush._--The ideal method of cooking mush is of course a double boiler  and just the amount of water the cereal will take up. Over an open fire,  that would result in a burned product and a caked kettle. The best way  is to make it very thin at first, and to boil it down to the proper  consistency.    _Beans_ will boil more quickly if you add a pinch of soda. An  exaggerated pinch, however, causes them to taste soapy, so beware. If  the water boils too low, add more _hot_ water, never cold; the latter  toughens them. When soft smash them with a fork, add water, and cook  with fat in the frying pan.    [Sidenote: A Quick Meal]    _Hardtack._--A most delicious dish to be eaten immediately is made of  pilot bread soaked soft, and then fried. The same cracker fried in olive  oil, without being previously soaked, comes out crisp and brown, but  without impaired transportability. When butter is scarce this is a fine  way to treat them in preparation for a cold lunch by the way.    _Macaroni_ should be plunged in boiling water, otherwise it gets tough.  What remains should be baked in mixture with whatever else is  left--whether meal, cereal, or vegetable.    _Corn._--After you have eaten what you want of the warmed-up, mix what  is left with a spoonful or so of sugar, some diluted milk, and a  spoonful of egg powder. Bake it.    [Illustration: In the heat of the day's struggle]    _Salmon_ may be eaten cold, but is better hashed up with bread crumbs,  well moistened, and baked before a hot fire.

There remains  still the problem of how you and it are to be transported. You may  travel through the wilderness by land or by water. In the former case  you will either go afoot or on horseback; in the latter you will use a  canoe. Let us now consider in detail the equipments necessary for these  different sorts of travel.    You will find the Mexican or cowboy saddle the only really handy riding  saddle. I am fully aware of the merits of the McClellan and army  saddles, but they lack what seems to me one absolute essential, and that  is the pommel or horn. By wrapping your rope about the latter you can  lead reluctant horses, pull firewood to camp, extract bogged animals,  and rope shy stock. Without it you are practically helpless in such  circumstances. The only advantage claimed for the army saddle is its  lightness. The difference in weight between it and the cowboy saddle  need not be so marked as is ordinarily the case. A stock saddle, used  daily in roping heavy cows, weighs quite properly from thirty-five to  fifty pounds. The same saddle, of lighter leather throughout, made by a  conscientious man, need weigh but twenty-five or thirty, and will still  be strong and durable enough for all ordinary use. My own weighs but  twenty-five pounds, and has seen some very hard service.    [Illustration: _Sawbuck Saddle._]    [Illustration: _Riding Saddle._]    [Sidenote: Stirrups]    The stirrup leathers are best double, and should be laced, never  buckled.
