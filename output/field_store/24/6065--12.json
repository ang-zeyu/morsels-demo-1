But, it may  be said, I have less strength than either of you. Neither have you the  strength of the centurion T. Pontius: is he the more eminent man on that  account? Let there be only a proper husbanding of strength, and let each  man proportion his efforts to his powers. Such an one will assuredly not  be possessed with any great regret for his loss of strength. At Olympia  Milo is said to have stepped into the course carrying a live ox on  his shoulders. Which then of the two would you prefer to have given to  you--bodily strength like that, or intellectual strength like that of  Pythagoras? In fine, enjoy that blessing when you have it; when it is  gone, don't wish it back--unless we are to think that young men should  wish their childhood back, and those somewhat older their youth! The  course of life is fixed, and nature admits of its being run but in one  way, and only once; and to each part of our life there is something  specially seasonable; so that the feebleness of children, as well as  the high spirit of youth, the soberness of maturer years, and the ripe  wisdom of old age--all have a certain natural advantage which should  be secured in its proper season. I think you are informed, Scipio, what  your grandfather's foreign friend Masinissa does to this day, though  ninety years old. When he has once begun a journey on foot he does not  mount his horse at all; when on horseback he never gets off his horse.  By no rain or cold can he be induced to cover his head. His body is  absolutely free from unhealthy humours, and so he still performs all  the duties and functions of a king. Active exercise, therefore, and  temperance can preserve some part of one's former strength even in old  age.    11. Bodily strength is wanting to old age; but neither is bodily  strength demanded from old men. Therefore, both by law and custom,  men of my time of life are exempt from those duties which cannot be  supported without bodily strength. Accordingly not only are we not  forced to do what we cannot do; we are not even obliged to do as much  as we can. But, it will be said, many old men are so feeble that they  cannot perform any duty in life of any sort or kind. That is not a  weakness to be set down as peculiar to old age: it is one shared by ill  health. How feeble was the son of P. Africanus, who adopted you! What  weak health he had, or rather no health at all! If that had not been  the case, we should have had in him a second brilliant light in the  political horizon; for he had added a wider cultivation to his father's  greatness of spirit. What wonder, then, that old men are eventually  feeble, when even young men cannot escape it? My dear Laelius and  Scipio, we must stand up against old age and make up for its drawbacks  by taking pains. We must fight it as we should an illness. We must look  after our health, use moderate exercise, take just enough food and drink  to recruit, but not to overload, our strength. Nor is it the body alone  that must be supported, but the intellect and soul much more. For they  are like lamps: unless you feed them with oil, they too go out from  old age. Again, the body is apt to get gross from exercise; but the  intellect becomes nimbler by exercising itself. For what Caecilius means  by \"old dotards of the comic stage\" are the credulous, the forgetful,  and the slipshod. These are faults that do not attach to old age as  such, but to a sluggish, spiritless, and sleepy old age. Young men are  more frequently wanton and dissolute than old men; but yet, as it is not  all young men that are so, but the bad set among them, even so senile  folly--usually called imbecility--applies to old men of unsound  character, not to all. Appius governed four sturdy sons, five daughters,  that great establishment, and all those clients, though he was both old  and blind. For he kept his mind at full stretch like a bow, and never  gave in to old age by growing slack. He maintained not merely an  influence, but an absolute command over his family: his slaves feared  him, his sons were in awe of him, all loved him. In that family, indeed,  ancestral custom and discipline were in full vigour. The fact is that  old age is respectable just as long as it asserts itself, maintains its  proper rights, and is not enslaved to any one. For as I admire a young  man who has something of the old man in him, so do I an old one who has  something of a young man. The man who aims at this may possibly become  old in body--in mind he never will. I am now engaged in composing the  seventh book of my _Origins_. I collect all the records of antiquity.  The speeches delivered in all the celebrated cases which I have defended  I am at this particular time getting into shape for publication. I am  writing treatises on augural, pontifical, and civil law. I am, besides,  studying hard at Greek, and after the manner of the Pythagoreans--to  keep my memory in working order--I repeat in the evening whatever I have  said, heard, or done in the course of each day. These are the exercises  of the intellect, these the training grounds of the mind: while I sweat  and labour on these I don't much feel the loss of bodily strength. I  appear in court for my friends; I frequently attend the Senate and bring  motions before it on my own responsibility, prepared after deep and  long reflection. And these I support by my intellectual, not my bodily  forces. And if I were not strong enough to do these things, yet I should  enjoy my sofa--imagining the very operations which I was now unable to  perform. But what makes me capable of doing this is my past life. For a  man who is always living in the midst of these studies and labours  does not perceive when old age creeps upon him. Thus, by slow and  imperceptible degrees life draws to its end. There is no sudden  breakage; it just slowly goes out.    12. The third charge against old age is that it LACKS SENSUAL PLEASURES.  What a splendid service does old age render, if it takes from us the  greatest blot of youth! Listen, my dear young friends, to a speech of  Archytas of Tarentum, among the greatest and most illustrious of men,  which was put into my hands when as a young man I was at Tarentum  with Q. Maximus. \"No more deadly curse than sensual pleasure has been  inflicted on mankind by nature, to gratify which our wanton appetites  are roused beyond all prudence or restraint. It is a fruitful source of  treasons, revolutions, secret communications with the enemy. In fact,  there is no crime, no evil deed, to which the appetite for sensual  pleasures does not impel us. Fornications and adulteries, and every  abomination of that kind, are brought about by the enticements of  pleasure and by them alone. Intellect is the best gift of nature or  God: to this divine gift and endowment there is nothing so inimical  as pleasure. For when appetite is our master, there is no place for  self-control; nor where pleasure reigns supreme can virtue hold its  ground. To see this more vividly, imagine a man excited to the highest  conceivable pitch of sensual pleasure. It can be doubtful to no one that  such a person, so long as he is under the influence of such excitation  of the senses, will be unable to use to any purpose either intellect,  reason, or thought. Therefore nothing can be so execrable and so fatal  as pleasure; since, when more than ordinarily violent and lasting, it  darkens all the light of the soul.\"    These were the words addressed by Archytas to the Samnite Caius Pontius,  father of the man by whom the consuls Spurius Postumius and Titus  Veturius were beaten in the battle of Caudium. My friend Nearchus of  Tarentum, who had remained loyal to Rome, told me that he had heard them  repeated by some old men; and that Plato the Athenian was present, who  visited Tarentum, I find, in the consulship of L. Camillus and Appius  Claudius.    What is the point of all this? It is to show you that, if we were unable  to scorn pleasure by the aid of reason and philosophy, we ought to have  been very grateful to old age for depriving us of all inclination for  that which it was wrong to do. For pleasure hinders thought, is a foe to  reason, and, so to speak, blinds the eyes of the mind. It is, moreover,  entirely alien to virtue. I was sorry to have to expel Lucius, brother  of the gallant Titus Flamininus, from the Senate seven years after his  consulship; but I thought it imperative to affix a stigma on an act of  gross sensuality. For when he was in Gaul as consul, he had yielded to  the entreaties of his paramour at a dinner-party to behead a man who  happened to be in prison condemned on a capital charge. When his brother  Titus was Censor, who preceded me, he escaped; but I and Flaccus could  not countenance an act of such criminal and abandoned lust, especially  as, besides the personal dishonour, it brought disgrace on the  Government.    13. I have often been told by men older than myself, who said that they  had heard it as boys from old men, that Gaius Fabricius was in the  habit of expressing astonishment at having heard, when envoy at the  headquarters of king Pyrrhus, from the Thessalian Cineas, that there was  a man of Athens who professed to be a \"philosopher,\" and affirmed that  everything we did was to be referred to pleasure. When he told this to  Manius Curius and Publius Decius, they used to remark that they wished  that the Samnites and Pyrrhus himself would hold the same opinion. It  would be much easier to conquer them, if they had once given themselves  over to sensual indulgences. Manius Curius had been intimate with  P. Decius, who four years before the former's consulship had devoted  himself to death for the Republic. Both Fabricius and Coruncanius knew  him also, and from the experience of their own lives, as well as from  the action of P. Decius, they were of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28198"],[0,"A Budget of Christmas Tales (#13)"],[1,"      And stood by the windows--Joe knew what it meant.       They'd nothing for supper! The words were so sad       That somehow they drowned all the hunger he had.       And surely God's miracles never have ceased--       Joe's hunger grew less when his sorrows increased.       When the coal ran out in winter's worst storm,       The fire burnt the harder that kept their hearts warm.       Their windows revealed many wonderful sights,       Long acres of roofing and high-flying kites;       At sunset, the great vault of heaven aglow,       The lining of gold on the clouds hanging low,       The cross on the top of St. Mary's high tower       Ablaze with the light of that magical hour;       And still, as the arrows of light slanted higher,       The last thing in sight was the great cross of fire.       Each day, as it vanished, the history old       Of Christ's crucifixion was reverently told;       To Him the boy learned to confide all his woes,       But oftenest prayed for a new suit of clothes,       Since those that he wore didn't fit him at all--       The coat was too large and the trousers too small,       And Joe looked so queer, from his head to his feet,       It grieved his proud soul to be seen in the street.       And sometimes he cherished a secret desire       To own a hand-sled, or to build a bonfire;       But reached one conclusion by various routes--       He could have better fun with a new pair of boots.       He thought how the old pair, when shiny and whole.       Had squeaked in a way that delighted his soul,       And remembrance grew sad as he strutted around       And tried hard, but vainly, to waken that sound.       The day before Christmas brought trouble for Joe,       A thousand times worse. 'Twas a terrible blow       To hear that old Santa Claus, god of his dreams.       Would not come that year with his fleet-footed teams.       He'd seen them. Why, once, of a night's witching hour       He saw them jump over the cross on the tower       And scamper away o'er the snow-covered roofs,       His heart beating time to the sound of their hoofs.       Not coming this year? Santa Claus must be dead,       He thought, as with sad tears he crept into bed.       And, as he lay thinking, the long strings of wire       Sang low in the wind like a deep-sounding lyre,       And Joe caught the notes of this solemn refrain--       \"He'll not come again! no, he'll not come again!\"       And oh! how the depths of his spirit were stirred       By thoughts that were born of the music he heard!       How cold were the winds, and they sang in their strife,       Of storms yet to come in the winters of life.       They mocked him, but mark how the faith of the child       Stood firm as a fortress, its hope undefiled;       For still the boy thought that, if Santa Claus knew       How great were their needs and their comforts how few,       He would come; and at length, when the first rays of light       Had fathomed the infinite depths of the night,       And brightened the windows, Joe cautiously crept       Out of bed: and he dressed while his mother still slept,       And down the long stairways on tiptoe he ran;       Then out in the snow, with the will of a man,       He went, looking hither and thither, because,       Poor boy! he was trying to find Santa Claus.       He hurried along through the snow-burdened street       As if the good angels were guiding his feet;       And as the sun rose in the heavens apace,       A radiance fell on his uplifted face       That came from the cross gleaming far overhead--       A symbol of hope for the living and dead.       A moment he looked at the great house of prayer,       Then slyly peeked in to see what was there;       And entering softly he wandered at will       Through pathways of velvet, deserted and still,       And saw the light grow on a wonderful scene       Of ivy-twined columns and arches of green,       And back of the rail, where the clergyman knelt,       He sat on the cushions to see how they felt.       How soft was that velvet he stroked with his hand!       But when he lay down, oh, the feeling was grand!       And while he was musing the walls seemed to sway,       And slowly the windows went moving away.       What, ho! there he comes! with his big pack and all,       Down the sunbeams that slope from the high-windowed wall,       And Joe tried to speak, but could not, if he died,       When Santa Claus came and sat down by his side.       \"A tenement boy! humph! he probably swears.\"       (Joe trembled, and tried hard to think of his prayers.)       He lifted Joe's eyelids, he patted his brow,       And said. \"He is not a bad boy, anyhow.\"       But hark! there is music; a deep-swelling sound       Is sweeping on high as if heavenward bound.       And suddenly waking, Joe saw kneeling there       The rector, long-robed, who was reading a prayer.       \"Provide for the fatherless children,\" said he       \"The widowed, the helpless, the bond and the free.\"       The rector stops praying--his face wears a frown;       A ragged young gamin is pulling his gown.       \"I knowed you would come,\" said the boy, half in fright--       \"I knowed you would come--I was watchin' all night.       Say! what are ye goin' t'give mother an' me?       Le'me see what 'tis, Santa Claus--please le'me see!\"       The rector looked down into Joe's honest face,       And a great wave of feeling swept over the place;       And tenderly laying his hand on Joe's head,       He turned to the people and solemnly said:       \"We pray that the poor may be sheltered and fed,       And we leave it to Heaven to furnish the bread.       Ye know, while He feedeth the fowls in the air.       The children of mankind He leaves to man's care;\"       And kissing Joe's face the preacher said then;       \"Of such is the kingdom of Heaven. Amen!\"       That day Santa Claus came to many a door       He'd forgotten to call at the evening before.       Was little Joe lucky? Well, now, you are right.       And the wires sang merrily all the next night.          ANGELA'S CHRISTMAS.    BY JULIA SCHAYER.      \"Then it is 'yes,' father dear?\" said Angela, looking across the  breakfast table with a smile. It was her mother's smile, and the girl  had filled her mother's vacant chair for more than a year.    The eyes of the father and daughter met, and Angela knew, before a word  was said, that she had conquered.    \"I hate to see you at your age, beginning to worry over these things,\"  Ephraim Frazier said, regretfully. \"Let the _old_ women take care of the  charities, dear. You keep on dancing in the sunshine a while longer,  daughter.\"    Angela's smile grew graver, but not less sweet.    \"I am twenty, dear,\" she said. \"Too old to dance _all_ the time, and I  cannot help _thinking_, you know. And--it's no use, papa dear! I _must_  do something! It _is_ 'yes,' isn't it?\"    \"You are sure you won't mind being criticised and ridiculed?\"    \"Quite sure!\" answered Angela.    \"And sure you won't take your failures and disappointments to heart too  deeply?\"    \"Quite sure I can bear them bravely,\" answered the girl. \"If only one,  _just one_, of those poor creatures may be helped, and lifted up, and  brought out of darkness, it will be worth trying for!\"    \"And what does Robert Johns say about it?\"    A glow kindled in Angela's face.    \"Robert is in perfect sympathy with me,\" she said softly. Then again,  this time having risen and gone around to his side, to speak with her  face against the old banker's smoothly shaven cheek, \"It _is_ 'yes,'  isn't it, daddy dear?\"    \"Well, yes! Only you must go slow, dear. You are not over strong, you  know.\"    And soon it came to pass that on a vacant lot, hitherto given over to  refuse heaps, haunted by stray cats, ragpickers, and vagrant children,  in one of the vilest quarters of the metropolis, there sprang up, with  magic swiftness, a commodious frame building, surrounded by smooth green  sod, known in the lower circles as the Locust Street Home; in upper  circles, laughingly denominated \"Angela's Experiment.\"    Angela did not mind. It was mostly goodnatured laughter, and many of the  laughers ended by lending willing hands and hearts to the cause. It was  wonderful how the news spread through the city's purlieus that here was  a sanctuary into which cold, hunger, and fatigue dared not intrude; a  place which the lowest might enter and be made welcome, and go  unquestioned, his personal rights as carefully respected as though he  were one of the Four Hundred.    That was Angela's theory. No man, woman, or child should be _compelled_  to anything. First make their bodies comfortable, then surround them  with ennobling influences and examples, entertain them, arouse them,  stimulate them, hold out the helping hand, _and leave the rest to God_.  \"They shall not even be _compelled_ to be clean!\" she said, laughing.  \"If the beautiful clean bathrooms and clean clothing do not tempt them  to cleanliness, then so be it! I will have no rules; only influences.  You will see!\"    And people did see, and wondered.    Sometimes, on warm, pleasant evenings, the spacious, cheerful hall, with  its tables and chairs, would be almost empty; but on nights like that on  which this story opens, a dark, cold December night, the seats were apt  to be well filled, mostly with slatternly, hard-featured women, and  dull-faced children, who sat staring stolidly about, while the music and  speaking went on; half stupefied by the warmth and tranquillity so  foreign to their lives.    Outside, a dismal sleet was falling, but from the open door of the  vestibule a great sheet of light fell upon the wet pavement, and above  it glowed a transparency bearing the words:    \"A Merry Christmas to all! Come in!\"    It was while the singing was going on, led by a high, sweet girl's  voice, that a human figure came hobbling out from a side street, and  stopped short at"]]]
