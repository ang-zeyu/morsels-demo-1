[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28897"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Volume II (of 2) (#13)"],[1,"ed, how oddly wild the cross-bred animals were. The European wild  boar and the Chinese domesticated pig are almost certainly specifically  distinct: Sir F. Darwin crossed a sow of the latter breed with a wild  Alpine boar which had become extremely tame, but the young, though having  half-domesticated blood in their veins, were \"extremely wild in  confinement, and would not eat swill like common English pigs.\" Mr. Hewitt,  who has had great experience in crossing tame cock-pheasants with fowls  belonging to five breeds, gives as the character of all \"extraordinary  wildness;\"[105] but I have myself seen one exception to this rule. Mr.  S. J. Salter,[106] who raised a large number of hybrids from a bantam-hen  by _Gallus Sonneratii_, states that \"all were exceedingly wild.\" Mr.  Waterton[107] bred some wild ducks from eggs hatched under a common duck,  and the young were allowed to cross freely both amongst themselves and with  the tame ducks; they were \"half wild and half tame; they came to the  windows to be fed, but still they had a wariness about them quite  remarkable.\"    On the other hand, mules from the horse and ass are certainly not in the  least wild, yet they are notorious for obstinacy and vice. Mr. Brent, who  has crossed canary-birds with many kinds of finches, has not observed, as  he informs me, that the hybrids were in any way remarkably wild. Hybrids  are often raised between the common and musk duck, and I have been assured  by three persons, who have kept these crossed birds, that they were not  wild; but Mr. Garnett[108] observed that his female hybrids exhibited  \"migratory propensities,\" of which there is not a vestige in the common or  musk duck. No case is {46} known of this latter bird having escaped and  become wild in Europe or Asia, except, according to Pallas, on the Caspian  Sea; and the common domestic duck only occasionally becomes wild in  districts where large lakes and fens abound. Nevertheless, a large number  of cases have been recorded[109] of hybrids from these two ducks, although  so few are reared in comparison with purely-bred birds of either species,  having been shot in a completely wild state. It is improbable that any of  these hybrids could have acquired their wildness from the musk-duck having  paired with a truly wild duck; and this is known not to be the case in  North America; hence we must infer that they have reacquired, through  reversion, their wildness, as well as renewed powers of flight.    These latter facts remind us of the statements, so frequently made by  travellers in all parts of the world, on the degraded state and savage  disposition of crossed races of man. That many excellent and kind-hearted  mulattos have existed no one will dispute; and a more mild and gentle set  of men could hardly be found than the inhabitants of the island of Chiloe,  who consist of Indians commingled with Spaniards in various proportions. On  the other hand, many years ago, long before I had thought of the present  subject, I was struck with the fact that, in South America, men of  complicated descent between Negroes, Indians, and Spaniards, seldom had,  whatever the cause might be, a good expression.[110] Livingstone,--and a  more unimpeachable authority cannot be quoted,--after speaking of a  half-caste man on the Zambesi, described by the Portuguese as a rare  monster of inhumanity, remarks, \"It is unaccountable why half-castes, such  as he, are so much more cruel than the Portuguese, but such is undoubtedly  the case.\" An inhabitant remarked to Livingstone, \"God made white men, and  God made black men, but the Devil made half-castes.\"[111] When two races,  both {47} low in the scale, are crossed, the progeny seems to be eminently  bad. Thus the noble-hearted Humboldt, who felt none of that prejudice  against the inferior races now so current in England, speaks in strong  terms of the bad and savage disposition of Zambos, or half-castes between  Indians and Negroes; and this conclusion has been arrived at by various  observers.[112] From these facts we may perhaps infer that the degraded  state of so many half-castes is in part due to reversion to a primitive and  savage condition, induced by the act of crossing, as well as to the  unfavourable moral conditions under which they generally exist.           *       *       *       *       *    _Summary on the proximate causes leading to Reversion._--When purely-bred  animals or plants reassume long-lost characters,--when the common ass, for  instance, is born with striped legs, when a pure race of black or white  pigeons throws a slaty-blue bird, or when a cultivated heartsease with  large and rounded flowers produces a seedling with small and elongated  flowers,--we are quite unable to assign any proximate cause. When animals  run wild, the tendency to reversion, which, though it has been greatly  exaggerated, no doubt exists, is sometimes to a certain extent  intelligible. Thus, with feral pigs, exposure to the weather will probably  favour the growth of the bristles, as is known to be the case with the hair  of other domesticated animals, and through correlation the tusks will tend  to be redeveloped. But the reappearance of coloured longitudinal stripes on  young feral pigs cannot be attributed to the direct action of external  conditions. In this case, and in many others, we can only say that changed  habits of life apparently have favoured a tendency, inherent or latent in  the species, to return to the primitive state.    It will be shown in a future chapter that the position of flowers on the  summit of the axis, and the position of seeds within the capsule, sometimes  determine a tendency towards reversion; and this apparently depends on the  amount of sap or nutriment which the flower-buds and seeds receive. The  position, also, of buds, either on branches or on roots, sometimes  determines, as was formerly shown, the transmission of the {48} proper  character of the variety, or its reversion to a former state.    We have seen in the last section that when two races or species are crossed  there is the strongest tendency to the reappearance in the offspring of  long-lost characters, possessed by neither parent nor immediate progenitor.  When two white, or red, or black pigeons, of well-established breeds, are  united, the offspring are almost sure to inherit the same colours; but when  differently-coloured birds are crossed, the opposed forces of inheritance  apparently counteract each other, and the tendency which is inherent in  both parents to produce slaty-blue offspring becomes predominant. So it is  in several other cases. But when, for instance, the ass is crossed with _A.  Indicus_ or with the horse,--animals which have not striped legs,--and the  hybrids have conspicuous stripes on their legs and even on their faces, all  that can be said is, that an inherent tendency to reversion is evolved  through some disturbance in the organisation caused by the act of crossing.    Another form of reversion is far commoner, indeed is almost universal with  the offspring from a cross, namely, to the characters proper to either pure  parent-form. As a general rule, crossed offspring in the first generation  are nearly intermediate between their parents, but the grandchildren and  succeeding generations continually revert, in a greater or lesser degree,  to one or both of their progenitors. Several authors have maintained that  hybrids and mongrels include all the characters of both parents, not fused  together, but merely mingled in different proportions in different parts of  the body; or, as Naudin[113] has expressed it, a hybrid is a living  mosaic-work, in which the eye cannot distinguish the discordant elements,  so completely are they intermingled. We can hardly doubt that, in a certain  sense, this is true, as when we behold in a hybrid the elements of both  species segregating themselves into segments in the same flower or fruit,  by a process of self-attraction or self-affinity; this segregation taking  place either by seminal or by bud-propagation. Naudin further believes that  the segregation of the two specific elements or essences is eminently  liable to occur in the male and female reproductive matter; and he thus  explains the almost {49} universal tendency to reversion in successive  hybrid generations. For this would be the natural result of the union of  pollen and ovules, in both of which the elements of the same species had  been segregated by self-affinity. If, on the other hand, pollen which  included the elements of one species happened to unite with ovules  including the elements of the other species, the intermediate or hybrid  state would still be retained, and there would be no reversion. But it  would, as I suspect, be more correct to say that the elements of both  parent-species exist in every hybrid in a double state, namely, blended  together and completely separate. How this is possible, and what the term  specific essence or element may be supposed to express, I shall attempt to  show in the hypothetical chapter on pangenesis.    But Naudin's view, as propounded by him, is not applicable to the  reappearance of characters lost long ago by variation; and it is hardly  applicable to races or species which, after having been crossed at some  former period with a distinct form, and having since lost all traces of the  cross, nevertheless occasionally yield an individual which reverts (as in  the case of the great-great-grandchild of the pointer Sappho) to the  crossing form. The most simple case of reversion, namely, of a hybrid or  mongrel to its grandparents, is connected by an almost perfect series with  the extreme case of a purely-bred race recovering characters which had been  lost during many ages; and we are thus led to infer that all the cases must  be related by some common bond.

CHAPTER V    In course of time the news came to Fionn that his mother's sister  was not living with Iollan. He at once sent a messenger calling  for fulfilment of the pledge that had been given to the Fianna, and  demanding the instant return of Tuiren. Iollan was in a sad condition  when this demand was made. He guessed that Uct Dealv had a hand in the  disappearance of his queen, and he begged that time should be given him  in which to find the lost girl. He promised if he could not discover  her within a certain period that he would deliver his body into Fionn's  hands, and would abide by whatever judgement Fionn might pronounce. The  great captain agreed to that.    \"Tell the wife-loser that I will have the girl or I will have his head,\"  said Fionn.    Iollan set out then for Faery. He knew the way, and in no great time he  came to the hill where Uct Dealv was.    It was hard to get Uct Dealv to meet him, but at last she consented, and  they met under the apple boughs of Faery.    \"Well!\" said Uct Dealv. \"Ah! Breaker of Vows and Traitor to Love,\" said  she.    \"Hail and a blessing,\" said Iollan humbly.    \"By my hand,\" she cried, \"I will give you no blessing, for it was no  blessing you left with me when we parted.\"    \"I am in danger,\" said Iollan.    \"What is that to me?\" she replied fiercely.    \"Fionn may claim my head,\" he murmured.    \"Let him claim what he can take,\" said she.    \"No,\" said Iollan proudly, \"he will claim what I can give.\"    \"Tell me your tale,\" said she coldly.    Iollan told his story then, and, he concluded, \"I am certain that you  have hidden the girl.\"    \"If I save your head from Fionn,\" the woman of the Shi' replied, \"then  your head will belong to me.\"    \"That is true,\" said Iollan.    \"And if your head is mine, the body that goes under it is mine. Do you  agree to that?\"    \"I do,\" said Iollan.    \"Give me your pledge,\" said Uct Dealv, \"that if I save you from this  danger you will keep me as your sweetheart until the end of life and  time.\"    \"I give that pledge,\" said Iollan.    Uct Dealv went then to the house of Fergus Fionnliath, and she broke the  enchantment that was on the hound, so that Tuiren's own shape came back  to her; but in the matter of two small whelps, to which the hound had  given birth, the enchantment could not be broken, so they had to remain  as they were. These two whelps were Bran and Sceo'lan. They were sent  to Fionn, and he loved them for ever after, for they were loyal and  affectionate, as only dogs can be, and they were as intelligent as human  beings. Besides that, they were Fionn's own cousins.    Tuiren was then asked in marriage by Lugaidh who had loved her so long.  He had to prove to her that he was not any other woman's sweetheart,  and when he proved that they were married, and they lived happily ever  after, which is the proper way to live. He wrote a poem beginning:         \"Lovely the day. Dear is the eye of the dawn--\"    And a thousand merry people learned it after him.    But as to Fergus Fionnliath, he took to his bed, and he stayed there for  a year and a day suffering from blighted affection, and he would have  died in the bed only that Fionn sent him a special pup, and in a week  that young hound became the Star of Fortune and the very Pulse of his  Heart, so that he got well again, and he also lived happily ever after.          OISIN'S MOTHER      CHAPTER I    EVENING was drawing nigh, and the Fianna-Finn had decided to hunt no  more that day. The hounds were whistled to heel, and a sober, homeward  march began. For men will walk soberly in the evening, however they go  in the day, and dogs will take the mood from their masters. They were  pacing so, through the golden-shafted, tender-coloured eve, when a  fawn leaped suddenly from covert, and, with that leap, all quietness  vanished: the men shouted, the dogs gave tongue, and a furious chase  commenced.    Fionn loved a chase at any hour, and, with Bran and Sceo'lan, he  outstripped the men and dogs of his troop, until nothing remained in the  limpid world but Fionn, the two hounds, and the nimble, beautiful fawn.  These, and the occasional boulders, round which they raced, or over  which they scrambled; the solitary tree which dozed aloof and beautiful  in the path, the occasional clump of trees that hived sweet shadow as  a hive hoards honey, and the rustling grass that stretched to infinity,  and that moved and crept and swung under the breeze in endless, rhythmic  billowings.    In his wildest moment Fionn was thoughtful, and now, although running  hard, he was thoughtful. There was no movement of his beloved hounds  that he did not know; not a twitch or fling of the head, not a cock  of the ears or tail that was not significant to him. But on this chase  whatever signs the dogs gave were not understood by their master.    He had never seen them in such eager flight. They were almost utterly  absorbed in it, but they did not whine with eagerness, nor did they cast  any glance towards him for the encouraging word which he never failed to  give when they sought it.    They did look at him, but it was a look which he could not comprehend.  There was a question and a statement in those deep eyes, and he could  not understand what that question might be, nor what it was they sought  to convey. Now and again one of the dogs turned a head in full flight,  and stared, not at Fionn, but distantly backwards, over the spreading  and swelling plain where their companions of the hunt had disappeared.  \"They are looking for the other hounds,\" said Fionn.    \"And yet they do not give tongue! Tongue it, a Vran!\" he shouted, \"Bell  it out, a Heo'lan!\"    It was then they looked at him, the look which he could not understand  and had never seen on a chase. They did not tongue it, nor bell it, but  they added silence to silence and speed to speed, until the lean grey  bodies were one pucker and lashing of movement.    Fionn marvelled. \"They do not want the other dogs to hear or to come on  this chase,\" he murmured, and he wondered what might be passing within  those slender heads.    \"The fawn runs well,\" his thought continued. \"What is it, a Vran, my  heart? After her, a Heo'lan! Hist and away, my loves!\"    \"There is going and to spare in that beast yet,\" his mind went on. \"She  is not stretched to the full, nor half stretched. She may outrun even  Bran,\" he thought ragingly.    They were racing through a smooth valley in a steady, beautiful, speedy  flight when, suddenly, the fawn stopped and lay on the grass, and it lay  with the calm of an animal that has no fear, and the leisure of one that  is not pressed.    \"Here is a change,\" said Fionn, staring in astonishment.    \"She is not winded,\" he said. \"What is she lying down for?\" But Bran and  Sceo'lan did not stop; they added another inch to their long-stretched  easy bodies, and came up on the fawn.    \"It is an easy kill,\" said Fionn regretfully. \"They have her,\" he cried.    But he was again astonished, for the dogs did not kill. They leaped and  played about the fawn, licking its face, and rubbing delighted noses  against its neck.    Fionn came up then. His long spear was lowered in his fist at the  thrust, and his sharp knife was in its sheath, but he did not use them,  for the fawn and the two hounds began to play round him, and the fawn  was as affectionate towards him as the hounds were; so that when a  velvet nose was thrust in his palm, it was as often a fawn's muzzle as a  hound's.    In that joyous company he came to wide Allen of Leinster, where the  people were surprised to see the hounds and the fawn and the Chief and  none other of the hunters that had set out with them.    When the others reached home, the Chief told of his chase, and it was  agreed that such a fawn must not be killed, but that it should be kept  and well treated, and that it should be the pet fawn of the Fianna.  But some of those who remembered Brah's parentage thought that as Bran  herself had come from the Shi so this fawn might have come out of the  Shi also.        CHAPTER II    Late that night, when he was preparing for rest, the door of Fionn's  chamber opened gently and a young woman came into the room. The captain  stared at her, as he well might, for he had never seen or imagined to  see a woman so beautiful as this was. Indeed, she was not a woman, but  a young girl, and her bearing was so gently noble, her look so modestly  high, that the champion dared scarcely look at her, although he could  not by any means have looked away.    As she stood within the doorway, smiling, and shy as a flower,  beautifully timid as a fawn, the Chief communed with his heart.    \"She is the Sky-woman of the Dawn,\" he said. \"She is the light on the  foam. She is white and odorous as an apple-blossom. She smells of spice  and honey. She is my beloved beyond the women of the world. She shall  never be taken from me.\"    And that thought was delight and anguish to him: delight because of such  sweet prospect, anguish because it was not yet realised, and might not  be.    As the dogs had looked at him on the chase with a look that he did not  understand, so she looked at him, and in her regard there was a question  that baffled him and a statement which he could not follow.    He spoke to her then, mastering his heart to do it.    \"I do not seem to know you,\" he said.    \"You do not know me indeed,\" she replied.    \"It is the more wonderful,\" he continued gently, \"for I should know  every person that is here. What do you require from me?\"    \"I beg your protection, royal captain.\"    \"I give that to all,\" he answered. \"Against whom do you desire  protection?\"    \"I am in terror of the Fear Doirche.\"    \"The Dark Man of the Shi?\"    \"He is my enemy,\" she said.    \"He is mine now,\" said Fionn. \"Tell me your story.\"    \"My name is Saeve, and I am a woman of Faery,\" she commenced. \"In the  Shi' many men gave me"]]]
