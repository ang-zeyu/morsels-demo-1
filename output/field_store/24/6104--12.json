Single interstitial  pieces of the ramuli, or even whole systems of branches, are quite  filled with a rich greasy protoplasm; the short pieces and ends are  bound by partitions which form particular, often tun-like or globular  cells; the longer ones are changed, through the formation of cross  partitions, into chains of similar cells; the latter often attain by  degrees strong, thick walls, and their greasy contents often pass into  innumerable drops of a very regular globular form and of equal size.  Similar appearances show themselves after the sowing of spores, which  are capable of germinating in the medium already described, from which  the air is excluded. Either short germinating utricles shoot forth,  which soon form themselves into rows of gemmules, or the spores swell  to large round bladders filled with protoplasm, and shoot forth on  various parts of their surface innumerable protuberances, which,  fixing themselves with a narrow basis, soon become round vesiculate  cells, and on which the same sprouts which caused their production are  repeated, formations which remind us of the fungus of fermentation  called globular yeast. Among all the known forms of gemmules we find a  variety which are intermediate, all of which show, when brought into a  normal condition of development, the same proportion, and the same  germination, as those we first described.    We have detailed rather at length the structure and development of one  of the most common of the Mucors, which will serve as an illustration  of the order. Other distinctions there may be which are of more  interest as defining the limits of genera, except such as may be  noticed when we come to write more specially of reproduction.    ASCOMYCETES.--Passing now to the _Ascomycetes_, which are especially  rich in genera and species, we must first, and but superficially,  allude to _Tuberacei_, an order of sporidiiferous fungi of subterranean  habit, and rather peculiar structure.[u] In this order an external  stratum of cells forms a kind of perithecium, which is more or less  developed in different genera. This encloses the hymenium, which is  sinuous, contorted, and twisted, often forming lacunae. The hymenium in  some genera consists of elongated, nearly cylindrical asci, enclosing a  definite number of sporidia; in the true truffles and their  immediate allies, the asci are broad sacs, containing very large and  beautiful, often coloured, sporidia. These latter have either a  smooth, warted, spinulose, or lacunose epispore, and, as will be seen  from the figures in Tulasne's Monograph,[v] or those in the last  volume of Corda's great work,[w] are attractive microscopical objects.  In some cases, it is not difficult to detect paraphyses, but in  others they would seem to be entirely absent. A comparatively large  number have been discovered and recorded in Great Britain,[x] but of  those none are more suitable for study of general structure than the  ordinary truffle of the markets.    The structure of the remaining Ascomycetes can be studied under two  groups, _i.e._, the fleshy Ascomycetes, or, as they have been termed,  the Discomycetes, and the hard, or carbonaceous Ascomycetes,  sometimes called the Pyrenomycetes. Neither of these names gives an  accurate idea of the distinctions between the two groups, in the  former of which the discoid form is not universal, and the latter  contains somewhat fleshy forms. But in the Discomycetes the  hymenium soon becomes more or less exposed, and in the latter it is  enclosed in a perithecium. The Discomycetes are of two kinds, the  pileate and the cup-shaped. Of the pileate such a genus as _Gyromitra_  or _Helvella_ is, in a certain sense, analogous to the Agarics  amongst _Hymenomycetes_, with a superior instead of an inferior  hymenium, and enclosed, not naked, spores. Again, _Geoglossum_ is  somewhat analogous to _Clavaria_. Amongst the cup-shaped, _Peziza_  is an Ascomycetous _Cyphella_. But these are perhaps more fanciful  than real analogies.    Recently Boudier has examined one group of the cup-shaped Discomycetes,  the _Ascobolei_, and, by making a somewhat free use of his Memoir,[y] we  may arrive at a general idea of the structure in the cupulate  Discomycetes. They present themselves at first under the form of a  small rounded globule, and almost entirely cellular. This small  globule, the commencement of the receptacle, is not long in increasing,  preserving its rounded form up to the development of the asci. At this  period, under the influence of the rapid growth of these organs, it soon  produces at its summit a fissure of the external membrane, which  becomes a more marked depression in the marginate species. The  receptacle thus formed increases rapidly, becomes plane, more convex,  or more or less undulated at the margin, if at all of large size.  Fixed to the place where it is generated by some more or less  abundant mycelioid filaments, the receptacle becomes somewhat  cup-shaped and either stipitate or sessile, composed of the  receptacle proper and the hymenium.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.--Section of cup of _Ascobolus_. _a._ External  cells. _b._ Secondary layer. _c._ Subhymenial tissue (Janczenski).]    The receptacle proper comprehends the subhymenial tissue, the  parenchyma, and the external membrane. The subhymenial tissue is  composed of small compact cells, forming generally a more coloured and  dense stratum, the superior cells of which give rise to the asci and  paraphyses. The parenchyma is seated beneath this, and is generally of  interlaced filaments, of a looser consistency than the preceding,  united by intermediate cellules. The external membrane, which  envelopes the parenchyma, and limits the hymenium, differs from the  preceding by the cells often being polyhedric, sometimes transverse,  and united together, and sometimes separable. Externally it is  sometimes smooth, and sometimes granular or hairy.    The hymenium is, however, the most, important part, consisting of (1)  the paraphyses, (2) the asci, and sometimes (3) an investing mucilage.  The asci are always present, the paraphyses are sometimes rare, and  the mucilage in many cases seems to be entirely wanting.    The paraphyses, which are formed at the first commencement of the  receptacle, are at first very short, but soon elongate, and become  wholly developed before the appearance of the asci. They are linear,  sometimes branched and sometimes simple, often more or less thickened  at their tips; almost always they contain within them some oleaginous  granules, either coloured or colourless. Their special function seems  still somewhat obscure, and Boudier suggests that they may be  excitatory organs for the dehiscence of the asci. However this may be,  some mycologists are of opinion that, at least in some of the  Ascomycetes, the paraphyses are abortive asci, or, at any rate, that  abortive asci mixed with the paraphyses cannot be distinguished from  them.    The mucilage forms itself almost at the same time as the paraphyses,  and previous to the formation of the asci. This substance appears as a  colourless or yellowish mucilage, which envelopes the paraphyses and  asci, and so covers the hymenium with a shining coat.    The asci appear first at the base of the paraphyses, under the form of  oblong cells, filled with colourless protoplasm. By rapid growth, they  soon attain a considerable size and fulness, the protoplasm being  gradually absorbed by the sporidia, the first indication of which is  always the central nucleus. The mucilage also partly disappears, and  the asci, attaining their maturity, become quite distinct, each  enclosing its sporidia. But before they take their complete growth  they detach themselves from the subhymenial tissue, and being  attenuated towards their base, are forced upwards by pressure of the  younger asci, to, and in some instances beyond, the upper surface of  the disc. This phenomenon commences during the night, and continues  during the night and all the morning. It attains its height at  mid-day, and it is then that the slightest breath of air, the  slightest movement, suffices to cause dehiscence, which is generally  followed by a scarcely perceptible contractile motion of the  receptacle.    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Asci, sporidia, and paraphyses of _Ascobolus_  (Boudier).]    There is manifestly a succession in formation and maturity of the asci  in a receptacle. In the true _Ascobolei_, in which the sporidia are  coloured, this may be more distinctly seen. At first some thin  projecting points appear upon the disc, the next day they are more  numerous, and become more and more so on following days, so as to  render the disc almost covered with raised black or crystalline  points;[z] these afterwards diminish day by day, until they ultimately  cease. The asci, after separation from the subhymenial tissue,  continue to lengthen, or it may be that their elasticity permits of  extension, during expulsion. Boudier considers that an amount of  elasticity is certain, because he has seen an ascus arrive at  maturity, eject its spores, and then make a sharp and considerable  movement of retraction, then the ascus returned again, immediately  towards its previous limits, always with a reduction in the number of  its contained sporidia.    The dehiscence of the asci takes place in the _Ascobolei_, in some  species of _Peziza_, _Morchella_, _Helvella_, and _Verpa_, by means of  an apical operculum, and in other _Pezizae_, _Helotium_, _Geoglossum_,  _Leotia_, _Mitrula_, &c., by a fissure of the ascus. This operculum  may be the more readily seen when the ascus is coloured by a drop of  tincture of iodine.    The sporidia are usually four or eight, or some multiple of that  number, in each ascus, rarely four, most commonly eight.

At length, in early June, the great grain-fields of Diarbekir, Farkin,  and Harpoot valleys, planted the year before, grew golden and bowed  their heavy spear-crowned heads in waiting for the sickle. But no  sickles were there, no scythes, not even knives. It was a new and sorry  sight for our full-handed American farming men to see those poor, hard  Asiatic hands trying, by main strength, to break the tough straw or pull  it by the roots. This state of things could not continue, and their  sorrow and pity gave place to joy when they were able to drain the  cities of Harpoot and Diarbekir of harvest tools, and turned the work of  all the village blacksmiths on to the manufacture of sickles and  scythes, and of flint workers upon the rude threshing machines.    They have told me since their return that the pleasantest memories left  to them were of those great valleys of golden grain, bending and falling  before the harvesters, men and women, each with the new, sharp sickle or  scythe, the crude threshing planks, the cattle trampling out the grain,  and the gleaners in the rear as in the days of Abraham and Moab. God  grant that somewhere among them was a kind-hearted king of the harvest  who gave orders to let some sheaves fall.    Even while this saving process was going on another condition no less  imperative arose. These fields must be replanted or starvation must be  simply delayed. Only the strength of their old-time teams of oxen could  break up the hard sod and prepare for the fall sowing. Not an  animal--ox, cow, horse, goat, or sheep--had been left. All had been  driven to the Kourdish Mountains. When Mr. Wood's telegram came, calling  for a thousand oxen for the hundreds of villages, I thought of our not  rapidly swelling bank account, and all that was needed everywhere else,  and replied accordingly.    When in return came the telegram from the Rev. Dr. Gates, president of  Harpoot College, the live, active, practical man of affairs, whose  judgment no one could question, saying that the need of oxen was  imperative, that unless the ground could be plowed before it dried and  hardened it could not be done at all, and the next harvest would be  lost, also that \"Mr. Wood's estimate was moderate,\" the financial  secretary was directed to send a draft for five thousand liras  (twenty-two thousand dollars) to the care of the Rev. Dr. Gates, to be  divided among the three expeditions for the purchase of cattle and the  progress of the harvest of 1897.    As the sum sent would be immediately applied, the active services of the  men would be no longer required, and directions went with the remittance  to report in person at Constantinople.    Unheard-of toil, care, hard riding day and night, with risk of life,  were all involved in the carrying out of that order. Among the  uncivilized and robber bands of Kourds, the cattle that had been stolen  and driven off must be picked up, purchased, and brought back to the  waiting farmer's field. There were routes so dangerous that a brigand  chief was selected by those understanding the situation as the safest  escort for our men. Perhaps the greatest danger encountered was in the  region of Farkin, beyond Diarbekir, where the official escort had not  been waited for, and the leveled musket of the faithless guide told the  difference.    At length the task was accomplished. One by one the expeditions closed  and withdrew, returning by Sivas and Samsoun, and coming out by the  Black Sea. With the return of the expeditions we closed the field. But  contributors would be glad to know that subsequent to this, before  leaving Constantinople, funds from both the New York and Boston  committees came to us amounting to about fifteen thousand dollars. This  was happily placed with Mr. W. W. Pect, treasurer of the Board of  Foreign Missions at Stamboul, to be used subject to our order; and with  our concurrence it was employed in the building of little houses in the  interior, as a winter shelter and protection, where all had been  destroyed.    The appearance of our men on their arrival at Constantinople confirmed  the impression that they had not been recalled too soon. They had gone  out through the snows and ice of winter, and without change or rest had  come back through the scorching suns of midsummer--five months of rough,  uncivilized life, faring and sharing with their beasts of burden,  well-nigh out of communication with the civilized world, but never out  of danger. It seemed but just to themselves and to others who might need  them, that change and rest be given them.    It would scarcely be permissible to express in words the obligation to  our American Minister, Hon. A. W. Terrell, at Constantinople, without  whose unremitting care and generous aid our work could not have been  accomplished. And, indeed, so many were the duties of that difficult and  delicate field that it seemed the help of no one hand or heart could be  spared. We felt that we had them all; from the palace of the Sultan to  beloved Robert College, from the American Legation to the busy rooms of  the American Board, with its masterly treasurer, Peet, were the same  outstretched hands of protection and care for our little band.    They knew we had taken our lives in our hands to come to them, and with  no thought of ourselves. We had done the best we knew to accomplish the  mission so persistently sought of us in our own country.    That our work had been acceptable to those who received its results, we  knew. They had never failed to _make_ us know. If also acceptable to Him  who gave us the courage, protection, and strength to perform it, we need  care for little more.    Funds to the total amount of $116,326.01 were cabled us by Mr. Spencer  Trask's committee, all of which were placed in the hands of Mr. W. W.  Peet, treasurer of the missionary board at Constantinople. All proper  receipts were given and taken, and feeling that we had faithfully and  successfully accomplished the work we had been asked to perform, we  closed the field, and prepared to return to America.    Some days of physical rest were needful for the men of the expeditions  after reaching Constantinople before commencing their journey of  thousands of miles for home, worn as they were by exposure and incessant  labor--physical and mental. I need not attempt to say with what  gratitude I welcomed back these weary, brown-faced men and officers  from a field so difficult and so perilous; none the less did the  gratitude go out to my faithful and capable secretary, who had toiled  early and late, never leaving for a day, striving with tender heart that  all should go well.    And when the first greetings were over, the full chorus of manly  voices--\"Home Again,\" \"Sweet Land of Liberty,\" \"Nearer My God to  Thee\"--that rolled out through the open windows of the Red Cross  headquarters in Constantinople fell on the listening ears of Christian  and Moslem alike, and though the tones were new and strange, all felt  that to some one, somewhere, they meant more than the mere notes of  music.          VIII    CUBA    1898      On our return to \"civilization\" we were rejoiced to find that as a  result of our three months' labors, the former tumult of Armenia had  died away into a peaceful echo, but a new murmur fast growing to clamor  had taken its place. Cuba had entered the ceaseless arena of American,  gladiatorial, humanitarian contest. The cruelties of the reconcentrado  system of warfare had become apparent, and methods of relief were  uppermost in the minds of all persons.    These methods were twofold and might well be classed under two distinct  heads: those who for mere pity's sake sought simple relief; those who  with a further forecast sought the removal of a cause as well as its  effect, and \"Cuba Libre\" was its muffled cry. They asked money for arms  as well as bread, and the struggle between the two held the country in  a state of perplexed contradiction for months running into years.    Our great-hearted President asked simple aid and was distressed at the  doubtful response. At length he suggested and we proffered the aid of  the Red Cross on a call to the country, and the establishment of the  \"Central Cuban Relief Committee\" in New York, within three days, was the  result.    The activity and success of that committee are too fresh in the minds of  all our people to require the smallest description from me. Too much  praise can not be given to our Auxiliary Societies from the Atlantic to  the Pacific for the splendid work in the camps at home, in Cuba, Porto  Rico, and in the care of our soldiers in transit to the Philippines.  Their full and complete reports show the great work accomplished. The  memory of the work of the busy men and tireless women who joined heart  and hand in this Heaven-sent task still brings tears to the eyes of a  nation at its recall.    The service assigned me by our anxious President, and gladly accepted,  was the distribution on the pitiful fields of Cuba. These scenes I  would not recall. The starving mothers and motherless babes, the  homelessness and squalor, the hopelessness and despair, are beyond all  words and all conception, save to those who saw and lived among them. It  is past and let it rest.    Then followed the declaration of hostilities, the blockade, the fleets  of war, and the stately, glistening white ships of relief that dotted  the sea--our navy after forty years of peace again doing service in its  own waters--and among them one inconspicuous, black-hulled sea-going  craft, laden with food for the still famishing reconcentrados, when they  could be reached.    Day after day, in its weary, waiting cruise, it watched out for an  opening to that closed-in suffering island, till at length"]]]
