The little green star has been seen emerging from behind the moon, ahead  of its ruddy companion. The magnitudes are one and seven and a half or  eight, distance 3\", p. 270 deg.. Antares is probably a binary, although its  binary character has not yet been established.    A slight turn of the telescope tube brings us to the star sigma, a wide  double, the smaller component of which is blue or plum-colored;  magnitudes four and nine, distance 20\", p. 272 deg.. From sigma we pass to  beta, a very beautiful object, of which the three-inch gives us a  splendid view. Its two components are of magnitudes two and six,  distance 13\", p. 30 deg.; colors, white and bluish. It is interesting to  know that the larger star is itself double, although none of the  telescopes we are using can split it. Burnham discovered that it has a  tenth-magnitude companion; distance less than 1\", p. 87 deg..    And now for a triple, which will probably require the use of our largest  glass. Up near the end of the northern prolongation of the constellation  we perceive the star xi. The three-inch shows us that it is double; the  five-inch divides the larger star again. The magnitudes are respectively  five, five and a half, and seven and a half, distances 0.94\", p. 215 deg.,  and 7\", p. 70 deg..    A still more remarkable star, although one of its components is beyond  our reach, is nu. With the slightest magnifying this object splits up  into two stars, of magnitudes four and seven, situated rather more than  40\" apart. A high power divides the seventh-magnitude companion into  two, each of magnitude six and a half, distance 1.8\", p. 42 deg.. But (and  this was another of Burnham's discoveries) the fourth-magnitude star  itself is double, distance 0.8\", p. about 0 deg.. The companion in this case  is of magnitude five and a half.    Next we shall need a rather low-power eyepiece and our largest aperture  in order to examine a star cluster, No. 4173, which was especially  admired by Sir William Herschel, who discovered that it was not, as  Messier had supposed, a circular nebula. Herschel regarded it as the  richest mass of stars in the firmament, but with a small telescope it  appears merely as a filmy speck that has sometimes been mistaken for a  comet. In 1860 a new star, between the sixth and seventh magnitude in  brilliance, suddenly appeared directly in or upon the cluster, and the  feeble radiance of the latter was almost extinguished by the superior  light of the stranger. The latter disappeared in less than a month, and  has not been seen again, although it is suspected to be a variable, and,  as such, has been designated with the letter T. Two other known  variables, both very faint, exist in the immediate neighborhood.  According to the opinion that was formerly looked upon with favor, the  variable T, if it is a variable, simply lies in the line of sight  between the earth and the star cluster, and has no actual connection  with the latter. But this opinion may not, after all, be correct, for  Mr. Bailey's observations show that variable stars sometimes exist in  large numbers in clusters, although the variables thus observed are of  short period. The cluster 4183, just west of Antares, is also worth a  glance with the five-inch glass. It is dense, but its stars are very  small, so that to enjoy its beauty we should have to employ a large  telescope. Yet there is a certain attraction in these far-away glimpses  of starry swarms, for they give us some perception of the awful  profundity of space. When the mind is rightly attuned for these  revelations of the telescope, there are no words that can express its  impressions of the overwhelming perspective of the universe.    The southern part of the constellation Ophiuchus is almost inextricably  mingled with Scorpio. We shall, therefore, look next at its attractions,  beginning with the remarkable array of star clusters 4264, 4268, 4269,  and 4270. All of these are small, 2' or 3' in diameter, and globular in  shape. No. 4264 is the largest, and we can see some of the stars  composing it. But these clusters, like those just described in Scorpio,  are more interesting for what they signify than for what they show; and  the interest is not diminished by the fact that their meaning is more or  less of a mystery. Whether they are composed of pygmy suns or of great  solar globes like that one which makes daylight for the earth, their  association in spherical groups is equally suggestive.    There are two other star clusters in Ophiuchus, and within the limits of  map No. 12, both of which are more extensive than those we have just  been looking at. No. 4211 is 5' or 6' in diameter, also globular,  brighter at the center, and surrounded by several comparatively  conspicuous stars. No. 4346 is still larger, about half as broad as the  moon, and many of its scattered stars are of not less than the ninth  magnitude. With a low magnifying power the field of view surrounding the  cluster appears powdered with stars.    There are only two noteworthy doubles in that part of Ophiuchus with  which we are at present concerned: 36, whose magnitudes are five and  seven, distance 4.3\", p. 195 deg., colors yellow and red; and 39, magnitudes  six and seven and a half, distance 12\", p. 356 deg., colors yellow or  orange and blue. The first named is a binary whose period has not been  definitely ascertained.    The variable R has a period a little less than three hundred and three  days. At its brightest it is of magnitude seven or eight, and at minimum  it diminishes to about the twelfth magnitude.    The spot where the new star of 1604 appeared is indicated on the map.  This was, with the exception of Tycho's star in 1572, the brightest  temporary star of which we possess a trustworthy account. It is  frequently referred to as Kepler's star, because Kepler watched it with  considerable attention, but unfortunately he was not as good an observer  as Tycho was. The star was first seen on October 10, 1604, and was then  brighter than Jupiter. It did not, however, equal Venus. It gradually  faded and in March, 1606, disappeared. About twelve degrees northwest of  the place of the star of 1604, and in that part of the constellation  Serpens which is included in map No. 12, we find the location of another  temporary star, that of 1848. It was first noticed by Mr. Hind on April  28th of that year, when its magnitude was not much above the seventh,  and its color was red. It brightened rapidly, until on May 2d it was of  magnitude three and a half. Then it began to fade, but very slowly, and  it has never entirely disappeared. It is now of the twelfth or  thirteenth magnitude.    In passing we may glance with a low power at nu Serpentis, a wide  double, magnitudes four and nine, distance 50\", p. 31 deg., colors  contrasted but uncertain.    Sagittarius and its neighbor, the small but rich constellation Scutum  Sobieskii, attract us next. We shall first deal with the western  portions of these constellations which are represented on Map No. 12.  The star in Sagittarius is a wide triple, magnitudes three and a half,  nine and a half, and ten, distances 40\", p. 315 deg., and 45\", p. 114 deg.. But  the chief glory of Sagittarius (and the same statement applies to Scutum  Sobieskii) lies in its assemblage of star clusters. One of these, No.  4361, also known as M 8, is plainly visible to the naked eye as a bright  spot in the Milky Way. We turn our five-inch telescope, armed with a low  magnifying power, upon this subject and enjoy a rare spectacle. As we  allow it to drift through the field we see a group of three  comparatively brilliant stars advancing at the front of a wonderful  train of mingled star clusters and nebulous clouds. A little northwest  of it appears the celebrated trifid nebula, No. 4355 on the map. There  is some evidence that changes have occurred in this nebula since its  discovery in the last century. Barnard has made a beautiful photograph  showing M 8 and the trifid nebula on the same plate, and he remarks that  the former is a far more remarkable object than its more famous  neighbor. Near the eastern border of the principal nebulous cloud there  is a small and very black hole with a star poised on its eastern edge.  This hole and the star are clearly shown in the photograph.    Cluster No. 4397 (M 24) is usually described as resembling, to the naked  eye, a protuberance on the edge of the Milky Way. It is nearly three  times as broad as the moon, and is very rich in minute stars, which are  at just such a degree of visibility that crowds of them continually  appear and disappear while the eye wanders over the field, just as faces  are seen and lost in a vast assemblage of people. This kind of luminous  agitation is not peculiar to M 24, although that cluster exhibits it  better than most others do on account of both the multitude and the  minuteness of its stars.    A slight sweep eastward brings us to yet another meeting place of stars,  the cluster M 25, situated between the variables U and V. This is  brilliant and easily resolved into its components, which include a  number of double stars.    The two neighboring variables just referred to are interesting. U has a  period of about six days and three quarters, and its range of magnitude  runs from the seventh down to below the eighth. V is a somewhat  mysterious star. Chandler removed it from his catalogue of variables  because no change had been observed in its light by either himself,  Sawyer, or Yendell. Quirling, the discoverer of its variability, gave  the range as between magnitudes 7.6 and 8.8. It must, therefore, be  exceedingly erratic in its changes, resembling rather the temporary  stars than the true variables.    In that part of Scutum Sobieskii contained in map No. 12 we find an  interesting double, Sigma 2325, whose magnitudes are six and nine,  distance 12.3\", p. 260 deg., "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28764"],[0,"Getting Acquainted with the Trees (#13)"],[1," Winter effect of tulip trees]    Let us consider this liriodendron first as a forest tree, as an  inhabitant of the \"great woods\" that awed the first intelligent  observers from Europe, many generations back. Few of our native trees  reach such a majestic height, here on the eastern side of the continent,  its habitat. Ordinarily it builds its harmonious structure to a height  of seventy or a hundred feet; but occasional individuals double this  altitude, and reach a trunk diameter of ten feet. While in the close  forest it towers up with a smooth, clean bole, in open places it assumes  its naturally somewhat conical form very promptly. Utterly dissimilar in  form from the American elm, it seems to stand for dignity, solidity and  vigor, and yet to yield nothing in the way of true elegance. The  botanists tell us it prefers deep and moist soil, but I know that it  lives and seems happy in many soils and in many places. Always and  everywhere it shows a clean, distinct trunk, its brown bark uniformly  furrowed, but in such a manner as to give a nearly smooth appearance at  a little distance. The branches do not leave the stem so imperceptibly  as do those which give the elm its very distinct form, but rather start  at a right angle, leaving the distinct central column of solid strength  unimpaired. The winter tracery of these branches, and the whole effect  of the liriodendron without foliage, is extremely distinct and pleasing.  I have in mind a noble group of great liriodendrons which I first saw  against an early April sky of blue and white. The trees had grown close,  and had interlaced their somewhat twisty branches, so that the general  impression was that of one great tree supported on several stems. The  pure beauty of these very tall and very stately trees, thus grouped and  with every twig sharply outlined, I shall always remember.    The liriodendron is more fortunate than some other trees, for it has  several points of attractiveness. Its stature and its structure are  alike notable, its foliage entirely unique, and its flowers and  seed-pods even more interesting. The leaf is very easily recognized when  once known. It is large, but not in any way coarse, and is thrust forth  as the tree grows, in a peculiarly pleasing way. Sheathed in the manner  characteristic of the magnolia family, of which the liriodendron is a  notable member, the leaves come to the light practically folded back on  themselves, between the two protecting envelopes, which remain until  the leaf has stretched out smoothly. Yellowish green at first, they  rapidly take on the bright, strong green of maturity. The texture is  singularly refined, and it is a pleasure to handle these smooth leaves,  of a shape which stamps them at once on the memory, and of a coloring,  both above and below, that is most attractive. They are maintained on  long, slender stems, or \"petioles,\" and these stems give a great range  of flexibility, so that the leaves of the liriodendron are, as Henry  Ward Beecher puts it, \"intensely individual, each one moving to suit  himself.\"    [Illustration: A great liriodendron in bloom]    Of course all this moving, and this out-breaking of the leaves from  their envelopes, take place far above one's head, on mature trees. It  will be found well worth while, however, for the tree-lover to look in  the woods for the rather numerous young trees of the tulip, and to  observe the very interesting way in which the growth proceeds. The  beautiful form and color of the leaves may also be thus conveniently  noted, as also in the autumn the soft, clear yellow early assumed.    It is the height and spread of the liriodendron that keep its truly  wonderful flowers out of the public eye. If they were produced on a  small tree like the familiar dogwood, for instance, so that they might  be nearer to the ground, they would receive more of the admiration so  fully their due. In Washington, where, as I have said, trees are planted  by design and not at random, there are whole avenues of liriodendrons,  and it was my good fortune one May to drive between these lines of  strong and shapely young trees just when they were in full bloom. The  appearance of these beautiful cups, each one held upright, not drooping,  was most striking and elegant. Some time, other municipalities will  learn wisdom from the example set in Washington, and we may expect to  see some variety in our street trees, now monotonously confined for the  most part to the maples, poplars, and a few good trees that would be  more valued if interspersed with other equally good trees of different  character. The pin-oak, the elm, the sweet-gum, or liquidambar, the  ginkgo, and a half-dozen or more beautiful and sturdy trees, do  admirably for street planting, and ought to be better known and much  more freely used.    [Illustration: Flowers of the liriodendron]    I have seen many rare orchids brought thousands of miles and petted into  a curious bloom--indeed, often more curious than beautiful. If the bloom  of the liriodendron, in all its delicate and daring mingling of green  and yellow, cream and orange, with its exquisite interior filaments,  could be labeled as a ten-thousand-dollar orchid beauty from Borneo, its  delicious perfume would hardly be needed to complete the raptures with  which it would be received into fashionable flower society. But these  lovely cups stand every spring above our heads by millions, their  fragrance and form, their color and beauty, unnoticed by the throng. As  they mature into the brown fruit-cones that hold the seeds, and these in  turn fall to the ground, to fulfil their purpose of reproduction, there  is no week in which the tree is not worthy of attention; and, when the  last golden leaf has been plucked by the fingers of the winter's frost,  there yet remain on the bare branches the curious and interesting  candlestick-like outer envelopes of the fruit-cones, to remind us in  form of the wonderful flower, unique in its color and attractiveness,  that gave its sweetness to the air of May and June.    These two trees--the elm and the liriodendron--stand out strongly as  individuals in the wealth of our American trees. Let all who read and  agree in my estimate, even in part, also agree to try, when opportunity  offers, to preserve these trees from vandalism or neglect, realizing  that the great forest trees of our country are impossible of  replacement, and that their strength, majesty and beauty are for the  good of all.          Nut-Bearing Trees      What memories of chestnutting parties, of fingers stained with the dye  of walnut hulls, and of joyous tramps afield in the very heart of the  year, come to many of us when we think of the nuts of familiar  knowledge! Hickory-nuts and butternuts, too, perhaps hazelnuts and even  beechnuts--all these American boys and girls of the real country know.  In the far South, and, indeed, reaching well up into the Middle West,  the pecan holds sway, and a majestic sway at that, for its size makes it  the fellow of the great trees of the forest, worthy to be compared with  the chestnut, the walnut, and the hickory.    But it has usually been of nuts to eat that we have thought, and the  chance for palatable food has, just as with some of the best of the  so-called \"fruit\" trees--all trees bear fruit!--partially closed our  eyes to the interest and beauty of some of these nut-bearers.    My own tree acquaintance has proceeded none too rapidly, and I have  been--and am yet--as fond of the toothsome nuts as any one can be who is  not a devotee of the new fad that attempts to make human squirrels of us  all by a nearly exclusive nut diet. I think that my regard for a nut  tree as something else than a source of things to eat began when I came,  one hot summer day, under the shade of the great walnut at Paxtang. Huge  was its trunk and wide the spread of its branches, while the richness of  its foliage held at bay the strongest rays of the great luminary. How  could I help admiring the venerable yet lusty old tree, conferring a  present benefit, giving an instant and restful impression of strength,  solidity, and elegance, while promising as well, as its rounded green  clusters hung far above my head, a great crop of delicious nut-fruit  when the summer's sun it was so fully absorbing should have done its  perfect work!    Alas for the great black walnut of Paxtang! It went the way of many  another tree monarch whose beauty and living usefulness were no defense  against sordid vandalism. In the course of time a suburb was laid out,  including along its principal street, and certainly as its principal  natural ornament, this massive tree, around which the Indians who roamed  the \"great vale of Pennsylvania\" had probably gathered in council. The  sixty-foot \"lot,\" the front of which the tree graced, fell to the  ownership of a man who, erecting a house under its beneficent  protection, soon complained of its shade. Then came a lumber prospector,  who saw only furniture in the still flourishing old black walnut. His  offer of forty dollars for the tree was eagerly accepted by the  Philistine who had the title to the land, and although there were not  wanting such remonstrances as almost came to a breaking of the peace,  the grand walnut ended its hundreds of years of life to become mere  lumber for its destroyers! The real estate man who sold the land greatly  admired the tree himself, realizing also its great value to the suburb,  and had never for one moment dreamed that the potential vandal who  bought the tree-graced parcel of ground would not respect the inherent  rights of all his neighbors. He told me of the loss with tears in his  eyes and rage in his language; and I have never looked since at the  fellow who did the deed without reprobation. More than that, he has  proven a theory I hold--that no really good man would do such a thing  after he had been shown the wrong of it--by"]]]
