I, Part I, 5:1.)    4. _Destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans_. \"A rebellious disturbance  among the Jews gave a semblance of excuse for a terrible chastisement  to be visited upon them by their Roman masters, which culminated in  the destruction of Jerusalem, A. D. 71. The city fell after a six  months' siege before the Roman arms led by Titus, son of the Emperor  Vespasian. Josephus, the famous historian, to whom we owe most of our  knowledge as to the details of the struggle, was himself a resident in  Galilee and was carried to Rome among the captives. From his record we  learn that nearly a million Jews lost their lives through the famine  incident to the siege; many more were sold into slavery, and uncounted  numbers were forced into exile. The city was utterly destroyed, and  the site upon which the temple had stood was plowed up by the Romans  in their search for treasure. Thus literally were the words of Christ  fulfilled, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that  shall not be thrown down.--(Matt. 24:1, 2; see also Luke 19:44.)\" (The  Author, \"The Articles of Faith,\" Lecture 17:18.)          CHAPTER V.    **Causes of Apostasy.--External Causes, Continued**.      1. As already pointed out, it is convenient to study the causes  leading to the great apostasy as belonging to two classes, external  and internal, or (1) causes due to conditions operating against the  Church from without; and (2) causes arising from dissension and heresy  within the Church itself. We have summarized external causes under  the general term persecution; and we have drawn a distinction between  Judaistic and pagan persecution waged against the Church. Having dealt  with the opposition suffered by the early Christians at the hands of  the Jews or through Jewish instigation, we have now to consider the  persecution brought upon the believers in Christ by pagan nations.    **Pagan Persecution**.    2. The term \"pagan\" as here used may be taken as a synonym of  \"heathen,\" and is to be understood as referring to persons or peoples  who did not believe in the existence of the living God, and whose  worship was essentially idolatrous. The motives impelling  non-believing Jews to oppose the establishment and spread of  Christianity may readily be understood, in view of the fact that the  religion taught by Christ appeared as a rival of Judaism, and that the  growth and spread of one meant the decline if not the extinction of  the other. The immediate motive leading to bitter and widespread  persecution of the Christians by heathen peoples is not so easy to  perceive, since there was no uniform system of idolatrous worship in  any single nation, but a vast diversity of deities and cults of  idolatry, to no one of which was Christianity opposed more than to  all. Yet we find the worshipers of idols forgetting their own  differences and uniting in opposition to the gospel of peace,--in  persecution waged with incredible ferocity and indescribable  cruelty.--(See Note 1, end of chapter.)    3. Unfortunately, historians differ widely in their records of  persecution of Christians, according to the point of view from which  each writer wrote. Thus, in a general way, Christian authors have  given extreme accounts of the sufferings to which the Church and its  adherents individually were subjected; while non-Christian historians  have sought to lessen and minimize the extent and severity of the  cruelties practiced against the Christians. There are facts, however,  which neither party denies, and to which both give place in their  separate records. To make a fair interpretation of these facts,  drawing just and true inferences therefrom, should be our purpose.    4. Among pagan persecutors of the Church, the Roman empire is the  principal aggressor. This may appear strange in view of the general  tolerance exercised by Rome toward her tributary peoples; indeed, the  real cause of Roman opposition to Christianity has given rise to many  conjectures. It is probable that intolerant zeal on the part of the  Christians themselves had much to do with their unpopularity among  heathen nations. This subject is conservatively summed up by Mosheim  as follows:    5. \"A very natural curiosity calls us to inquire, how it happened that  the Romans, who were troublesome to no nation on account of their  religion, and who suffered even the Jews to live under their own laws,  and follow their own methods of worship, treated the Christians alone  with such severity. This important question seems still more difficult  to be solved, when we consider, that the excellent nature of the  Christian religion, and its admirable tendency to promote both the  public welfare of the state, and the private felicity of the  individual, entitled it, in a singular manner, to the favor and  protection of the reigning powers. One of the principal reasons of the  severity with which the Romans persecuted the Christians,  notwithstanding these considerations, seems to have been the  abhorrence and contempt with which the latter regarded the religion of  the empire, which was so intimately connected with the form, and  indeed, with the very essence of its political constitution. For,  though the Romans gave an unlimited toleration to all religions which  had nothing in their tenets dangerous to the commonwealth, yet they  would not permit that of their ancestors, which was established by the  laws of the state, to be turned into derision nor the people to be  drawn away from their attachment to it. These, however, were the two  things which the Christians were charged with, and that justly, though  to their honor. They dared to ridicule the absurdities of the pagan  superstition, and they were ardent and assiduous in gaining proselytes  to the truth. Nor did they only attack the religion of Rome, but also  all the different shapes and forms under which superstition appeared  in the various countries where they exercised their ministry. From  this the Romans concluded, that the Christian sect was not only  insupportably daring and arrogant, but, moreover, an enemy to the  public tranquillity, and every way proper to excite civil wars and  commotions in the empire. It is probably on this account that Tacitus  reproaches them with the odious character of haters of mankind, and  styles the religion of Jesus as destructive superstition; and that  Suetonious speaks of the Christians and their doctrine in terms of the  same kind.    6. \"Another circumstance that irritated the Romans against the  Christians, was the simplicity of their worship, which resembled in  nothing the sacred rites of any other people. The Christians had  neither sacrifices, nor temples, nor images, nor oracles, nor  sacerdotal orders; and this was sufficient to bring upon them the  reproaches of an ignorant multitude, who imagined that there could be  no religion without these.\"--(Mosheim, \"Eccl. Hist.,\" Cent. 1, Part 1,  ch. 5:6, 7.)    7. Persecution of the Church by Roman authority may be said to have  begun in the reign of Nero (A. D. 64) and to have continued to the  close of Diocletian's reign (A. D. 305.) Within this range of time  there were many periods of diminished severity, if not of comparative  tranquillity; nevertheless, the Church was the object of heathen  oppression for about two and a half centuries. Attempts have been made  by Christian writers to segregate the persecutions into ten distinct  and separate onslaughts; and some profess to find a mystic relation  between the ten persecutions thus classified, and the ten plagues of  Egypt, as also an analogy with the ten horns mentioned by John the  Revelator.--(See Rev. 17:14.) As a matter of fact attested by history,  the number of persecutions of unusual severity was less than ten;  while the total of all, including local and restricted assaults, would  be much greater.--(See Note 2, end of chapter.)    8. _Persecution under Nero_. The first extended and notable  persecution of Christians under the official edict of a Roman emperor  was that instigated by Nero, A. D. 64. As students of history know,  this monarch is remembered mostly for his crimes. During the latter  part of his infamous reign, a large section of the city of Rome was  destroyed by fire. He was suspected by some of being responsible for  the disaster; and, fearing the resentment of the infuriated people, he  sought to implicate the unpopular and much-maligned Christians as the  incendiaries, and by torture tried to force a confession from them. As  to what followed the foul accusation, let us consider the words of a  non-Christian writer, Tacitus, whose integrity as a historian is held  in esteem.    9. \"With this view, he (Nero) inflicted the most exquisite tortures on  those men who, under the vulgar appellation of Christians, were  already branded with deserved infamy. They derived their name and  origin from Christ, who, in the reign of Tiberius had suffered death  by the sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate. For a while this  dire superstition was checked but it again burst forth; and not only  spread itself over Judea, the first seat of this mischievous sect, but  was even introduced into Rome, the common asylum which receives and  protects whatever is impure, whatever is atrocious. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],[0,"How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#13)"],[1," assorted marriages there is always more or less anxiety felt  upon the wedding-day.    The possibility of a hitch arising from a sudden change of inclination  on the part of the principals is ludicrously illustrated by the case of  two couples who on one occasion presented themselves at the Mayoralty,  in a suburb of Paris, to carry out the civil portion of their marriage  contract. During the ceremony one of the bridegrooms saw, or fancied he  saw, his partner making \"sheep's-eyes\" at the bridegroom opposite. Being  of a jealous temperament, he laid his hand roughly on her arm, and said  sharply: \"Mademoiselle, which of the two brides are you? You are mine, I  believe: then oblige me by confining your glances to me.\" The bride was  a young woman of spirit, and resenting the tone in which the reprimand  was made, retorted: \"Ah, Monsieur, if you are jealous already, I am  likely to lead a pleasant life with you!\" The jealous bridegroom made an  angry reply; and then the other bridegroom must needs put his oar in.  This led to a general dispute, which the Mayor in vain endeavoured to  quell. The bridegrooms stormed at each other; and the brides, between  their hysterical sobs, mutually accused each other of perfidy. At length  the Mayor, as a last resource, adjourned the ceremony for half an hour,  to admit of an amicable understanding being arrived at, both brides  having refused to proceed with the celebration of the nuptials. When, at  the expiration of the half-hour, the parties were summoned to reappear,  they did so, to the amazement of the bewildered Mayor, in an altogether  different order from that in which they had originally entered. The  bridegrooms had literally effected an exchange of brides--the jealous  bridegroom taking the jealous bride; and the other, the lady whose  fickle glances had led to the rupture. All four adhering to the new  arrangement, the Mayor, it is recorded, had no alternative but to  proceed with the ceremony.    The ruling passion is not more strongly felt in death than in marriage.  Dr. Johnson displayed the sturdiness of his character as he journeyed  with the lady of his choice from Birmingham to Derby, at which last  place they were to be married. Their ride thither, which we give in the  bridegroom's own words, is an amusing bit of literary history. \"Sir, she  had read the old romances, and had got into her head the fantastical  notion that a woman of spirit should use her lover like a dog. So, sir,  at first she told me that I rode too fast, and she could not keep up  with me: and when I rode a little slower, she passed me, and complained  that I lagged behind. I was not to be made the slave of caprice; and I  resolved to begin as I meant to end. I therefore pushed on briskly, till  I was fairly out of her sight. The road lay between two hedges, so I was  sure she could not miss it; and I contrived that she should soon come up  with me. When she did, I observed her to be in tears.\"    On the wedding-day of the celebrated M. Pasteur, who has made such  extraordinary discoveries about germs, the hour appointed for the  ceremony had arrived, but the bridegroom was not there. Some friends  rushed off to the laboratory and found him very busy with his apron on.  He was excessively cross at being disturbed, and declared that marriage  might wait, but his experiments could not do so.    He would indeed be a busy man who could not make time for a marriage  ceremony as brief as that which was employed in the celebration of a  marriage in Iowa, United States. The bride and bridegroom were told to  join their hands, and then asked: \"Do you want one another?\" Both  replied: \"Yes.\" \"Well, then, have one another;\" and the couple were man  and wife. Most people, however, desire a more reverent solemnization of  marriage, which may be viewed in two aspects--as a natural institution,  and as a religious ordinance. In the Old Testament we see it as a  natural institution; in the New, it is brought before us in a religious  light. It is there likened to the union of Christ and the Church. The  union of Christ and the Church is not illustrated by marriage, but  marriage by this spiritual union; that is, the natural is based upon the  spiritual. And this is what is wanted; it gives marriage a religious  signification, and it thus becomes a kind of semi-sacrament. The  illustration teaches that in order to be happy though married the  principle of sacrifice must rule the conduct of the married. As no love  between man and wife can be true which does not issue in a sacrifice of  each for the other, so Christ gave Himself for His Church and the Church  sacrifices itself to His service. The only true love is self-devotion,  and the every-day affairs of married life must fail without this  principle of self-sacrifice or the cross of Christ.    \"Would to God that His dear Son were bidden to all weddings as to that  of Cana! Truly then the wine of consolation and blessing would never be  lacking. He who desires that the young of his flock should be like  Jacob's, fair and ring-straked, must set fair objects before their eyes;  and he who would find a blessing in his marriage, must ponder the  holiness and dignity of this mystery, instead of which too often  weddings become a season of mere feasting and disorder.\"    A new home is being formed in reference to which the bride and groom  should think, \"This is none other but the house of God, and this is the  gate of heaven. As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\" The  parish church is called \"God's House;\" but if all the parishioners  rightly used their matrimony, every house in the parish might be called  the same. Home is the place of the highest joys; religion should  sanctify it. Home is the sphere of the deepest sorrows; the highest  consolation of religion should assuage its griefs. Home is the place of  the greatest intimacy of heart with heart; religion should sweeten it  with the joy of confidence. Home discovers all faults; religion should  bless it with the abundance of charity. Home is the place for  impressions, for instruction and culture; there should religion open her  treasures of wisdom and pronounce her heavenly benediction.    An old minister previous to the meeting of the General Assembly of the  Church of Scotland used to pray that the assembly might be so guided as  \"_no to do ony harm_.\" We have often thought that such a prayer as this  would be an appropriate commencement for the marriage service.  Considering the issues that are involved in marriage--the misery unto  the third and fourth generation that may result from it--those who join  together man and woman in matrimony ought to pray that in doing so they  may do no harm. Certainly the opening exhortation of the Church of  England marriage service is sufficiently serious. It begins by  proclaiming the sacredness of marriage as a Divine institution;  hallowed as a type of the mystical union between Christ and His Church;  honoured (even in its festive aspect) by Our Lord's presence and first  miracle at Cana of Galilee; declared to be \"honourable among all men;  and therefore not by any to be enterprised, nor taken in hand,  unadvisedly, lightly, or wantonly; but reverently, discreetly,  advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God; duly considering the causes  for which Matrimony was ordained.\" These are explained in words  plain-spoken almost to coarseness before allusion is made to the higher  moral relation of \"mutual society, help, and comfort\" which marriage  creates.    Then follows \"the betrothal\" in which the man \"plights his troth\"  (pledges his truth), taking the initiative, while the woman gives hers  in return:      \"The 'wilt thou,' answered, and again    The 'wilt thou' asked, till out of twain    Her sweet 'I will' has made ye one.\"    The \"joining of hands\" is from time immemorial the pledge of  covenant--we \"shake hands over a bargain\"--and is here an essential part  of the marriage ceremony.    The use of the ring is described in the prayer that follows as the token  of the marriage covenant--from the man the token of his confiding to his  wife all authority over what is his, and for the woman the badge of  belonging to his house. The old service has a quaint rubric declaring it  put on the fourth finger of the left hand, because thence \"there is a  vein leading direct to the heart.\" The Prayer Book of Edward VI. directs  that \"the man shall give unto the woman a ring, and other tokens of  spousage, as gold or silver, laying the same upon the book.\" This is  clearly the ancient bride price. Wheatly's \"Book of Common Prayer\" says,  \"This lets us into the design of the ring, and intimates it to be the  remains of an ancient custom whereby it was usual for the man to  purchase the woman.\" The words to be spoken by the man are taken from  the old service, still using the ancient word \"worship\" (worth--ship)  for service and honour. They declare the dedication both of person and  substance to the marriage bond.    The Blessing is one of singular beauty and solemnity. It not only  invokes God's favour to \"bless, preserve, and keep\" the newly-made  husband and wife in this world, but looks beyond it to the life  hereafter, for which nothing can so well prepare them as a well-spent  wedded life here.    It is said that among the natives of India the cost to a father of  marrying his daughter is about equal to having his house burnt down.  Although brides are not so expensive in this country much money is  wasted on the wedding and preliminaries which would be very useful to  the young people a year or two afterwards.    We would not advise that there should be no wedding-breakfast and that  the bride should have no trousseau; but we do think that these  accessories should be in accordance with the family exchequer. Again,  wedding presents are often the very articles that the young couple need  least, and are not unfrequently found to be duplicates"]]]
