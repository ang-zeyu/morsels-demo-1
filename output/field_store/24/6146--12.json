There was war then with Kulbarga in 1419, Deva Raya II. being king  of Vijayanagar. The Sultan had been unsuccessful in his attack on  the Warangal fortress, Pangul, and the troops of Vijayanagar marched  against him with horse, foot, and elephants. Firuz Shah gave battle  forthwith, though he judged his forces to be inferior. Firishtah does  not mention where the fight took place.    \"Meer Fuzzul Oollah, who commanded the troops of Islaam, charged the  infidels with heroic vigour, and, routing their center, proceeded to  attack their right wing. He was on the point of gathering the flowers  of victory, when one of his own attendants, bribed for the purpose  by Dewul Roy, gave him a mortal wound on the head, and he instantly  quaffed the sherbet of martyrdom. This fatal event changed the fortune  of the day; the sultan was defeated, and with the utmost difficulty,  by the most surprising and gallant efforts, made his escape from  the field. The Hindoos made a general massacre of the mussulmauns,  and erected a platform with their heads on the field of battle. They  followed the sultan into his own country, which they wasted with fire  and sword, took many places, broke down many mosques and holy places,  slaughtered the people without mercy; by their actions seeming to  discharge the treasured malice and resentment of ages. Sultan Firoze  Shaw, in the exigence of distress, requested aid of the sultan of  Guzarat, who, having but just acceded to the throne, could afford  none. At last fortune took a turn favourable to his affairs, and the  enemy, after repeated battles, were expelled from his dominions by  the Sultan's brother, Khankhanan; but these misfortunes dwelt on the  mind of Firoze Shaw, now old, and he fell into a lingering disorder  and lowness of spirits.\"    The Sultan desired the throne for his son Hasan, husband of the  beautiful Pertal, but on Ahmad Khankhanan taking up arms to support  his intended usurpation and advancing, supported by most of the nobles,  to the capital, Firuz gave way and nominated him Sultan in his stead.    Firuz died on September 24, A.D. 1422,[103] and Khankhanan became  Sultan of Kulbarga under the title of Ahmad Shah I.    The first act of the new monarch, after \"impressing the minds of  his people with affection to his government\" -- probably, that is,  after an interval of a few months -- was to strengthen his army in  order to take revenge for the invasions of the Raya; and having made  all preparations he advanced to the attack. Deva Raya's generals  collected their troops, sent for aid to Warangal, and marched to  the Tungabhadra where they encamped. From this it appears that they  had retired from the Doab after their successful raid. The Sultan  arrived on the north bank of the river opposite the Hindu camp,  and LAAGERED, if we may use the term now in fashion. Firishtah says  that he \"surrounded his camp with carriages (carts and waggons),  after the usage of Room (Turkey in Europe), to prevent the enemy's  foot from making night-attacks. Here he halted for forty days.\" We  are now, therefore, probably in the dry season at the beginning of  the year A.D. 1423, for if the river had been in flood there would  have been no fear of the enemy's crossing it. In the early months of  the Christian year that river is usually shallow in the open country  east of the Hindu capital and away from the hills that surround it,  having only thin streams running in its rocky bed. Indeed, Firishtah  himself tells us that the river was at that time fordable.    Then ensued a dramatic episode. The Muhammadan cavalry had crossed the  river and devastated the country of the Raya, who remained inactive,  and the Sultan determined on a direct frontal attack. The troops of  Warangal deserted the Raya and withdrew.    \"Early in the morning Lodi Khan, Aulum Khan, and Dillawer Khan,  who had marched during the night and forded the river at distance,  reached the environs of the enemy's camp. It happened that the roy was  sleeping, attended by only a few persons, in a garden, close to which  was a thick plantation of sugar-cane.[104] A body of the mussulmauns  entered the garden for plunder, and Dewul Roy, being alarmed, fled  almost naked into the sugar-cane plantation. Here he was found by  the soldiers, who thought him only a common person, and -- having  loaded him with a bundle of canes, obliged him to run with it before  them. Dewul Roy, rejoiced at his being undiscovered, held his peace,  and took up the burden readily, hoping that he should be discharged  as a poor person or be able to make his escape.    \"They had not gone far when the alarm of Sultan Ahmed Shaw's having  crossed the river, and the loss of the roy, filled the camp, and the  Hindoos began to disperse. The sultan entered the camp, and Dewul Roy's  masters, hoping now for more valuable plunder than sugar-cane, hastened  to join their own fronds, leaving him to shift for himself. Dewul  Roy ran with his own troops, and about noon came up with some of his  nobles, by whom he was recognised and received with great joy. His  safety being made known, his army rallied into some order; but as he  regarded the late accident as an ill omen, he laid aside all thoughts  of engaging in the field, and fled to Beejanuggur.[105]    \"Ahmad Shaw not stopping to besiege the city, overran the open country,  and wherever he came, put to death men; women, and children, without  mercy, contrary to the compact made by his ancestor Mahummud Shaw  with the roies of Beejanuggur. Laying aside all humanity, whenever  the number of the slain amounted to twenty thousand, he halted three  days, and made a festival in celebration of the bloody work. He  broke down the idol temples, and destroyed the colleges of the  Bramins. During these operations a body of five thousand Hindoos,  enraged to desperation at the destruction of their country and the  insults of their gods, united in taking an oath to sacrifice their  lives in attempting to kill the sultan, as the grand author of all  their sufferings. For this purpose they employed spies to observe  his motions, that they might seize the first opportunity of action.    \"It happened, that the sultan going to hunt, in the eagerness of  chase separated from the body of his attendants, and advanced near  twelve miles from his camp.[106] The devoted infidels, informed of  the circumstance, immediately hastened to intercept him, and arrived  in sight when even his personal attendants, about two hundred Moguls,  were at some distance from him. The sultan alarmed, galloped on in  hopes of gaining a small mud enclosure which stood on the plain as  a fold for cattle, but was so hotly pursued, that some broken ground  falling in his way, he was not able to cross it before his pursuers  came up. Luckily some archers at this instant arrived to his aid, so  that the enemy were delayed sufficiently to give the sultan time to  reach the enclosure with his friends. The infidels attempted to enter,  and a sharp conflict took place; all the faithful repeating the creed  of testimony, and swearing to die, rather than submit.... Their little  troop being mostly killed and wounded, the assailants advanced close to  the wall, which they began to throw down with pickaxes and hatchets,  so that the sultan was reduced to the extremity of distress. At this  critical juncture arrived Abd-al-Kadir, first armour-bearer to the  sultan, and a body of troops, with whom, fearful of some accident  having happened to occasion his absence, he had left the camp in  search of his master. The infidels had completed a wide breach, and  were preparing to enter, when they found their rear suddenly attacked  The sultan with his remaining friends joined Abd-al-Kadir in attacking  the enemy, who after a long struggle were driven off the field, with  a loss of a thousand men, and about five hundred of the mussulmauns  attained martyrdom. Thus the sultan, by the almost inspired caution  of Abd-al-Kadir, acceded, as it were, a second time, from the depths  of danger to the enjoyment of empire.[107] It deserves place among  the records of time, as a remarkable event, that two sovereigns at  the head of armies, should fall into such danger for want of numbers,  and both escape uninjured....    \"after this event Ahmed Shaw, having laid waste the whole country,  marched to Beejanuggur, which he kept so closely blocked up, that  the inhabitants were reduced to the greatest distress; when Dewul  Roy, to spare his people, sent ambassadors to the sultan entreating  peace, to which he consented, on condition that he would send the  tribute of as many years as he had neglected to pay,[108] laden  on his best elephants, and conducted by his son, with his drums,  trumpets, and all the other insignia of state, to his camp. Dewul Roy,  unable to refuse compliance, agreed to the demands, and sent his son  with thirty favourite elephants, loaded with treasure and valuable  effects. The sultan sent some noblemen to meet him; and after being led  in ceremony through the market and great streets of the camp, he was  brought to the presence.[109] The sultan, after embracing, permitted  him to sit at the foot of his throne, and putting on his shoulders a  magnificent robe, and girding him with a sabre set with jewels, gave  him twenty beautiful horses of various countries, a male elephant,  dogs for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33129"],[0,"Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, Vol. I. (#13)"],[1,"ect, but the senate had not yet acted upon it, and its fate in that  body was considered doubtful. In the mean time, a commissioner had been  sent to Texas, and two days after our arrival at Merida the Texan  schooner of war San Antonio arrived at Sisal, bringing a proposition  for Yucatan to pay $8000 per month toward the support of the Texan  navy, and for the Texan vessels to remain upon the coast of Yucatan and  protect it against invasion by Mexico. This proposition was accepted  immediately, and negotiations were pending for farther co-operation in  procuring a recognition of their mutual independence. Thus, while  shrinking from an open declaration of independence, Yucatan was  widening the breach, and committing an offence which Mexico could never  forgive, by an alliance with a people whom that government, or rather  Santa Ana, regarded as the worst of rebels, and whom he was bent upon  exerting the whole power of the country in an effort to reconquer. Such  was the disjointed and false position in which Yucatan stood at the  time of our presentation to the governor.    Our visit to him was made at his private residence, which was one  befitting his station as a private gentleman, and not unworthy of his  public character. His reception-room was in the sala or parlour of his  house, in the centre of which, after the fashion of Merida, three or  four large chairs covered with morocco were placed facing each other.    Don Santiago Mendez was about fifty years of age, tall and thin, with a  fine intellectual face, and of very gentlemanly appearance and  deportment. Free from internal wars, and saved by her geographical  position from the sanguinary conflicts common in the other Mexican  states, Yucatan has had no school for soldiers; there are no military  chieftains and no prepossessions for military glory. Don Santiago  Mendez was a merchant, until within a few years, at the head of a  respectable commercial house in Campeachy. He was so respected for  uprightness and integrity, that in the unsettled state of affairs he  was agreed upon by the two opposite parties as the best person in the  state to place at the head of the government. His popularity, however,  was now somewhat on the wane, and his position was neither easy nor  enviable. From a quiet life and occupations, he found himself all at  once in the front rank of a wide-spread rebellion. An invasion from  Mexico was constantly apprehended, and should it prove successful,  while others would escape by reason of their insignificance, his head  would be sure to fall. The two great parties, one in favour of keeping  open the door of reconciliation with Mexico, and the other for  immediate and absolute separation, were both urging him to carry out  their views. The governor shrank from the hazard of extremes, was  vacillating, undecided, and unequal to the emergency. In the mean time,  the enthusiasm which led to the revolution, and which might have  achieved independence, was wearing away. Dissatisfaction and discontent  prevailed. Both parties blamed the governor, and he did not know  himself to which he belonged.    There was nothing equivocal, however, in his reception of us. He knew  the object of our return to the country, and offered us all the  facilities the government could bestow. Whatever was to be the fate of  Yucatan, it was fortunate for us that it was then free from the  dominion of Mexico, and repudiated entirely the jealous policy which  threw impediments in the way of strangers seeking to explore the  antiquities of the country; and it was also fortunate, that on my  former visit Yucatan had impressed me favourably; for, had it been  otherwise, my situation might have been made uncomfortable, and the two  journals of Merida, the \"Commercial Bulletin\" and the \"Nineteenth  Century,\" instead of giving us a cordial welcome, and bespeaking favour  for us, might have advised us to return home by the same vessel that  brought us out.    Our only business in Merida was to make inquiries about ruins and  arrangements for our journey into the interior, but in the mean time we  had no lack of other occupation.    The house of the Dona Micaela was the rendezvous of all strangers in  Merida, and a few days after our arrival there was an unprecedented  gathering. There were Mr. Auchincloss and his son, Mr. Tredwell, Mr.  Northrop, Mr. Gleason, and Mr. Robinson, formerly United States consul  at Tampico, who had come out passengers by the Lucinda, all citizens of  the United States; and, besides these, the arrival of the schooner of  war San Antonio, from Texas, brought among us a citizen of the world,  or, at least, of a great part of it. Mr. George Fisher, as appeared by  his various papers of naturalization, was \"natural de la ciudad y  fortaleza de Belgrada en la provincia de Servia del Imperio Ottomano,\"  or a \"native of the city and fortress of Belgrade, in the province of  Servia, in the Ottoman Empire.\" His Sclavonic name was Ribar, which in  the German language, means a Fischer, and at school in Austria it was  so translated, from which in the United States it became modified to  Fisher. At seventeen he embarked in a revolution to throw off the yoke  of the sultan, but the attempt was crushed, and forty thousand  Sclavonians, men, women, and children, were driven across the Danube,  and took refuge in the Austrian territory. The Austrian government, not  liking the presence of so many revolutionists within its borders,  authorized the organizing of a Sclavonic legion. Mr. Fisher entered it,  made a campaign in Italy, and, at the end of the year, in the interior  of the country, where there was no danger of their disseminating  revolutionary notions, the legion was disbanded. After expeditions of  various kinds along the Danube, in Turkey, to Adrianople, and along the  Adriatic, he traded back, most of the way on foot, until he reached  Hamburgh, where, in 1815, he embarked for Philadelphia. Hence he  crossed over to the Ohio River, and in the State of Mississippi, by  five years' residence, and abjuring all other allegiance, became a  citizen of the United States. Mexico obtained her independence, and he  moved on to that country, becoming, by due process of law, a Mexican  citizen. Here he established a newspaper, which, during the presidency  of Santa Ana, became so conspicuous for its liberal opinions, that one  fine morning an officer waited upon him with a paper containing  permission for him to leave the country \"por el tiempo necessario,\"  which being translated, meant, not to return very soon. With this he  \"sloped\" for Texas, and became a citizen of that young republic. It was  strange in that remote and secluded place to meet one from a region  still more distant and even less known, speaking every language in  Europe, familiar with every part of it, with the history of every  reigning family, the territorial limits of every prince, and at the  same time a citizen of so many republics.    His last allegiance was uppermost; his feelings were all Texan, and he  gave us many interesting particulars touching the condition and  prospects of that country. He was, of course, soon at home in the  politics of Yucatan, and he had some little personal interest in  watching them closely; for, should Santa Ana regain the ascendancy, the  climate would be altogether too warm for him. He had saddle and bridle,  sword and pistols--all that he needed except a horse--hanging up in his  room, and at a moment's notice he was ready to mount and ride.    Our meeting with this gentleman added much to the interest of our time  in Merida. In the evening, when we had settled the affairs of Yucatan,  we made an excursion into Illyria or the interior of Turkey. He was as  familiar with the little towns in those countries as with those in  Mexico. His knowledge of persons and places, derived from actual  observation, was most extensive; in short, his whole life had been a  chapter of incidents and adventures; and these were not yet ended. He  had a new field opened to him in Yucatan. We parted with him in Merida,  and the next that we heard of him was of his being in a situation quite  as strange as any he had ever been in before. Yet there was nothing  reckless, restless, or unsettled about him; he was perfectly fixed and  methodical in all his notions and modes of action; in Wall-street he  would be considered a staid, regular, quiet, middle-aged man, and he  was systematic enough in his habits to be head director of the Bank of  England.    I must not omit to mention, among those whom we were in the habit of  seeing every day, another old acquaintance, of the Spanish Hotel in  Fulton-Street, Don Vicente Calera, who, at the time of our former  visit, was still travelling in the United States. In the mean time he  had returned, married, and was again domesticated in his native city.    Under his escort we traversed Merida in every direction, and visited  all the public buildings and institutions.    The population of Merida is probably about twenty-three thousand. Two  tables are published in the Appendix; but both purport to give the  population of the district, and neither that of the city alone. The  city stands on a great plain, on a surface of limestone rock, and the  temperature and climate are very uniform. During the thirteen days that  we were in Merida the thermometer varied but nine degrees; and,  according to a table of observations kept for many years by the  much-esteemed Cura Villamil, it appears that during the year beginning  on the first of September, 1841, which included the whole time that we  were in the country, the greatest variation was but twenty-three  degrees. By the kindness of the cura, I have been furnished with a copy  of this table, from which I extract the observations for the days that  we passed in Merida. The entire table is published in the Appendix. The  observations were made by a Fahrenheit thermometer kept in"]]]
