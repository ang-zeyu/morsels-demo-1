He jumped out of bed and pushed aside  the fly of his tent to see half a dozen naked women dragged through the  streets--the result of a raid upon the unoffending Bokari. He dressed,  in a sweat of indignation and fear, and went to the chief's hut,  fortunately without his interpreter, for what Olari said would have  paralysed him.    In the morning (after this entirely unsatisfactory interview) he paraded  his four Houssas and such of his carriers as he could find, and prepared  to depart.    \"Master,\" said Olari, when the request was interpreted, \"I would rather  you stayed. The land is full of bad people, and I have still much to  tell you of the devilishness of Sandi. Moreover,\" said the chief,  \"to-night there is to be a great dance in your honour,\" and he pointed  to where three slaves were engaged in erecting a big post in the centre  of the village street.    \"After this I will let you go,\" said Olari, \"for you are my father and  my mother.\"    The Hon. George was hesitating, when, of a sudden, at each end of the  street there appeared, as if by magic, twenty travel-stained Houssas.  They stood at attention for a moment, then opened outwards, and in the  centre of each party gleamed the fat water-jacket of a Maxim gun.    The chief said nothing, only he looked first one way and then the other,  and his brown face went a dirty grey. Sanders strolled leisurely along  toward the group. He was unshaven, his clothes were torn with  bush-thorn, in his hand was a long-barrelled revolver.    \"Olari,\" he said gently; and the chief stepped forward.    \"I think, Olari,\" said Sanders, \"you have been chief too long.\"    \"Master, my father was chief before me, and his father,\" said Olari, his  face twitching.    \"What of Tagondo, my friend?\" asked Sanders, speaking of Carter by his  native name.    \"Master, he died,\" said Olari; \"he died of the sickness _mongo_--the  sickness itself.\"    \"Surely,\" said Sanders, nodding his head, \"surely you also shall die of  the same sickness.\"    Olari looked round for a way of escape.    He saw the Hon. George looking from one to the other in perplexity, and  he flung himself at the correspondent's feet.    \"Master!\" he cried, \"save me from this man who hates me!\"    George understood the gesture; his interpreter told him the rest; and,  as a Houssa servant reached out his hand to the chief, the son of the  house of Widnes, strong in the sense of his righteousness, struck it  back.    \"Look here, Sanders,\" forgetting all his previous misgivings and fears  concerning the chief, \"I should say that you have punished this poor  devil enough!\"    \"Take that man, sergeant,\" said Sanders sharply; and the Houssa gripped  Olari by the shoulder and flung him backward.    \"You shall answer for this!\" roared the Hon. George Tackle, in impotent  wrath. \"What are you going to do with him? My God! No, no!--not without  a trial!\"    He sprang forward, but the Houssas caught him and restrained him.           *     *     *     *     *    \"For what you have done,\" said the correspondent--this was a month  after, and he was going aboard the homeward steamer--\"you shall suffer!\"    \"I only wish to point out to you,\" said Sanders, \"that if I had not  arrived in the nick of time, you would have done all the suffering--they  were going to sacrifice you on the night I arrived. Didn't you see the  post?\"    \"That is a lie!\" said the other. \"I will make England ring with your  infamy. The condition of your district is a blot on civilisation!\"           *     *     *     *     *    \"There is no doubt,\" said Mr. Justice Keneally, summing up in the libel  action, Sanders v. _The Courier and Echo_ and another, \"that the  defendant Tackle did write a number of very libellous and damaging  statements, and, to my mind, the most appalling aspect of the case is  that, commissioned as he was to investigate the condition of affairs in  the district of Lukati, he did not even trouble to find out where Lukati  was. As you have been told, gentlemen of the jury, there are no less  than four Lukatis in West Africa, the one in Togoland being the  district in which it was intended the defendant should go. How he came  to mistake Lukati of British West Africa for the Lukati of German  Togoland, I do not know, but in order to bolster up his charges against  a perfectly-innocent British official he brought forward a number of  unsupported statements, each of which must be regarded as damaging to  the plaintiff, but more damaging still to the newspaper that in its  colossal ignorance published them.\"    The jury awarded Sanders nine thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds.            CHAPTER VI.      THE DANCING STONES.      Heroes should be tall and handsome, with flashing eyes; Sanders was not  so tall, was yellow of face, moreover had grey hair. Heroes should also  be of gentle address, full of soft phrases, for such tender women who  come over their horizon; Sanders was a dispassionate man who swore on  the slightest provocation, and had no use for women any way.    When you place a man upon a throne, even though that throne be a wooden  stool worth in the mart fourpence more or less, you assume a  responsibility which greatly outweighs all the satisfaction or personal  gratification you may derive from your achievement. There is a grave in  Toledo, a slab of brass, over a great king-maker who lived long enough  to realise his insignificance. The epitaph upon that brass tomb of his  is eloquent of his sum knowledge of life and human effort.      PULVIS     ET    NIHIL    says the inscription, and Powder and Nothing is the ultimate destiny of  all king-makers.    Sanders was a maker of kings in the early days. He helped break a few,  so it was in obedience to the laws of compensation that he took his part  in reconstructive work.    He broke Esindini, Matabini, T'saki--to name three--and helped, in the  very old days, and in another country, to break Lobengula, the Great  Bull.    King-maker he was beyond question--you could see Republicanism written  legibly in the amused grin with which he made them--but the kings he  made were little ones--that is the custom of the British-African rule,  they break a big king and put many little kings in his place, because it  is much safer.    Somewhere about 12 north, and in longitude 0, is a land which is  peculiar for the fact that it is British, French, German, and  Italian--according to which map of Africa you judge it by.    At the time of which I write it was neither, but it was ruled by  Mensikilimbili for the Great King. He was the most powerful of monarchs,  and, for the matter of that, the most cruel. His dominion stretched  \"from moonrise to sunset,\" said the natives, and he held undisputed  sway.    He had a court, and sat upon an ivory throne, and wore over the leopard  skins of his rank a mantle woven of gold thread and scarlet thread, and  he administered justice. He had three hundred wives and forty thousand  fighting men, and his acquaintance with white men began and ended with  the coming of a French Mission, who presented him with a tall hat, a  barrel organ, and one hundred thousand francs in gold.    This was Limbili, the great King of Yitingi.    The little kings of the Southern lands spoke of him with bated breath;  his name was uttered in a low voice, as of a god; he was the symbol of  majesty and of might--the Isisi people, themselves a nation of some  importance, and boastful likewise, referred to themselves disparagingly  when the kingdom of Yitingi was mentioned.    Following the French Mission, Sanders went up as envoy to the Limbilu,  carrying presents of a kind and messages of good will.    He was escorted into the territory by a great army and was lodged in the  city of the king. After two days' waiting he was informed that his  Majesty would see him, and was led to the Presence.    The Presence was an old man, a vicious old man, if Sanders was any judge  of character, who showed unmistakable signs of anger and contempt when  the Commissioner displayed his presents.    \"And what are these, white man?\" said the king. \"Toys for my women, or  presents for my little chiefs?\"    \"These are for your Greatness,\" said Sanders quietly, \"from a people who  do not gauge friendship by the costliness of presents.\"    The king gave a little sniff.    \"Tell me, white man,\" he said; \"in your travels have you ever seen so  great a king as I?\"    \"Lord king,\" said Sanders, frank to a fault. \"I have seen greater.\"    The king frowned, and the crowd about his sacred person muttered  menacingly.    \"There you lie,\" said the king calmly; \"for there never was a greater  king than I.\"    \"Let the white man say who is greater,\" croaked an aged councillor, and  a murmur of approval arose.    \"Lord,\" said Sanders, looking into the eyes of the old man who sat on  the throne, \"I have seen Lo Ben.\"[2]    The king frowned again, and nodded.    \"Of him I have heard,\" he said; \"he was a great king and an eater-up of  nations--who else?\"    \"King,\" lied Sanders, \"also Ketcewayo\"; and something like a hush fell  upon the court, for the name of Ketcewayo was one that travelled north.    \"But of white kings,\" persisted the chief; \"is there a white king in the  world whose word when it goes forth causes men to tremble?\"    Sanders grinned internally, knowing such a king, but answered that in  all his life he had never met such a king.    \"And of armies,\" said the king, \"have you ever seen an army such as  mine?\"    And so through the category of his possessions he ran; and Sanders,  finding that the lie was to save himself a great deal of trouble, lied  and acclaimed King Limbili as the greatest king in all the world,  commander of the most perfect army, ruler of a sublime kingdom.    It may be said that the kingdom of Yitingi owed its integrity to its  faults, for, satisfied with the perfection of all his possessions, the  great king confined his injustices,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35554"],[0,"A Voice of Warning (#13)"],[1,"baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.  And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they  cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up  serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them;  they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\" Mark, xvi,  15-18. Now I wish the reader not to pass over this commission until he  understands it, because when once understood, he never need mistake  the kingdom of God, but will at once discover those peculiarities  which were forever to distinguish it from all other kingdoms or  religious systems on earth. Lest he should misunderstand, we will  analyze it, and look at each part carefully in its own proper light;  first, they were to preach the Gospel, or in other words, the glad  tidings of a crucified and risen Redeemer, to all the world; secondly,  he that believed, and was baptized, should be saved; thirdly, he that  did not believe what they preached should be damned; and fourthly,  these signs should follow them that believed: first, they were to cast  out devils; second, to speak with new tongues; third, to take up  serpents; fourth, if they drank any deadly thing, it should not hurt  them; fifth, they were to lay hands on the sick, and they should  recover.    Now, it is wilful blindness, or ignorance of the English language,  that has ever caused any misunderstanding here. For some tell us that  those signs were only to follow the Apostles; and others, that they  were only to follow believers in that age. But Christ places the  preaching, believing, salvation, and the signs that were to follow,  all on an equal footing; where one was limited, the other must be;  where one ceased, the other did. If the language limits these signs to  the Apostles, it limits faith and salvation also to them. If no others  were to have these signs follow them, then no others were to believe,  and no others were to be saved. Again, if the language limits these  signs to the first age or ages of Christianity, then it limits  salvation to the first ages of Christianity, for one is precisely as  much limited as the other; and where one is in force, the other is;  and where one ends, the other must stop. And as well might we say,  preaching of the Gospel is no longer needed; neither faith nor  salvation; these were only given at first to establish the Gospel; as  to say, the signs are no longer necessary, they were only given at  first to establish the Gospel. But, says the astonished reader: \"Have  not these signs ceased from among men?\" I reply, prove that they have  ceased, and it will prove that the Gospel has ceased to be preached,  that men have ceased to believe and be saved, and that the world is  without the kingdom of God; or else it will prove that Jesus Christ  was an impostor, and His promises of no effect.    Now, having analyzed and understood this commission, let us still  pursue the subject of the organization of the kingdom of God in the  days of the Apostles. The Savior, having given them their authority,  commands them to tarry, and not undertake their mission, until they  were endowed with power from on high. But why this delay? Because no  man was ever qualified, or ever will be, to preach the Gospel, and  teach all things whatsoever Jesus commanded him, without the Holy  Ghost; and a very different Holy Ghost, too, from the one enjoyed by  men who are not inspired, for the Holy Ghost of which Jesus spake  would guide into all truth, bring all things to remembrance,  whatsoever He had said unto them, and show them things to come--not to  mention that it would enable them to speak in all the languages of the  earth. Now, a man who preaches needs that Holy Ghost very much; first,  to guide into all truth, that he may know what to teach; second, to  strengthen his memory, lest he might neglect to teach some of the  things which were commanded him; and, third, he needs to know things  to come, that he may forewarn his hearers of approaching danger, and  that would constitute him a prophet. From this, the reader may see how  careful Jesus was that none should preach His Gospel without the Holy  Ghost. He may also learn how different the Spirit of Truth is from the  spirit now abroad in the earth, deceiving the world, under the name of  the Holy Ghost. If the churches of the present day have the Holy  Ghost, why are they so much at a loss to understand truth? Why do they  walk in so many different ways and doctrines? Why do they need whole  libraries of sermons, tracts, divinities, debates, arguments, and  opinions, all written by the wisdom of men, without even professing to  be inspired? Well doth the Lord complain, saying: \"Their fear toward  me is taught by the precepts of men.\" But to return; the Apostles  tarried at Jerusalem until endowed with power, and then they commenced  to proclaim the Gospel.    Here we have discovered several things towards a kingdom: first, we  have found a King, crowned at the right hand of God, to whom is  committed all power in heaven and on earth; second, commissioned  officers, duly appointed to administer the affairs of government;  third, the laws by which they were to be governed were ALL THINGS  WHATSOEVER JESUS HAD COMMANDED HIS DISCIPLES TO TEACH THEM.    And now, if we can find how men became citizens of that kingdom, I  mean as to the rules of adoption, then we have found the kingdom of  God in that age, and shall be very much dissatisfied with every thing  in our own age, professing to be the kingdom of God, which is not  according to the pattern.    It happened that there were no natural born subjects of that kingdom,  for both Jew and Gentile were included in sin and unbelief; and none  could be citizens without the law of adoption. All that believed on  the name of the King had power to be adopted, but there was but one  invariable rule or plan by which they were adopted; and all that  undertook to claim citizenship, in any other way whatever, were  counted thieves and robbers, and could never obtain the seal of  adoption. This rule was laid down in the Savior's teaching to  Nicodemus, namely: \"Except a man be born of water (that is, baptized  in water), and of the Spirit (that is, baptized with the Spirit), he  cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"    Now, to Peter were given the keys of the kingdom; therefore it was his  duty to open the kingdom to Jew and also to Gentile. We will therefore  carefully examine the manner in which he did adopt the Jews into the  kingdom on the day of Pentecost.    Now, when the multitude came running together on the day of Pentecost,  the Apostle Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice  and reasoned with them from the Scriptures, testifying of Jesus  Christ, and His resurrection and ascension on high--insomuch that many  became convinced of the truth, and inquired what they should do. These  were not Christians, but they were people who were that moment  convinced that Jesus was the Christ; and because they were convinced  of this fact, they inquired--\"What shall we do?\" Then Peter said unto  them: \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus  Christ, for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of  the Holy Ghost: for the promise is unto you, and your children, and to  all that are afar of, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.\" My  reader, do you understand this proclamation? If you do, you will see  that this Gospel is not generally preached in modern times. Let us  therefore analyze and examine it, sentence by sentence. You recollect  they already believed, and the next thing was for them to repent;  first, faith; second, repentance; third, baptism; fourth, remission of  sins; and fifth, the Holy Ghost. This was the order of the Gospel.  Faith gave the power to become sons, or citizens; repentance, and  baptism in His name, was the obedience through which they were  adopted; and the Holy Spirit of promise was the seal of their  adoption, and this they were sure to receive if they would obey.    Now, reader, where do you hear such preaching in our day? Who teaches  that those who believe and repent, should be baptized, and none  others? Perhaps the reader may say the Baptists do; but do they call  upon men to be baptized as soon as they believe and repent? And  moreover, do they promise the remission of sins, with the gift of the  Holy Ghost? Recollect, now, what effect the Holy Ghost has upon people  who receive it. It will guide them into all truth, strengthen the  memory, and show them things to come. And Joel has said, it would  cause them to dream dreams, to see visions, and to prophesy. O! my  reader, where do you find a Gospel like this preached among men? Would  men go mourning for weeks upon weeks, without the forgiveness of sins,  or the comfort of the Holy Spirit, if Peter stood among us to tell  precisely how to get such blessings? Now, what would you think of a  camp meeting, where three thousand men should come forward to be  prayed for, and one of the ministers should (Peter like) command them  every one to repent, and be baptized for the remission of sins,  promising that all who obeyed should receive the remission of sins and  the gift of the Holy Ghost, which should cause them to dream dreams  and prophesy; and then should arise with his brethren of the same  calling, and the same hour commence baptizing, and continue until they  had baptized them all; and the Holy Ghost should fall upon them, and  they begin to see visions, speak in other tongues, and prophecy? Would  not the news go abroad, far and wide, that a new doctrine had made its  appearance, quite different from any thing now practised among men? O  yes, says the reader, this, to be sure, would be something new, and  very strange to all of us. Well, strange as it may seem, it is the  Gospel, as preached by Peter on the day of Pentecost; and Paul"]]]
