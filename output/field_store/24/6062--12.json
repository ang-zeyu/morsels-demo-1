It does not require much imagination to believe that these hardy  vegetable mountaineers love their wild, desolate dwelling-places as  truly as do the human residents of the region. An old man in Bethlehem  told me that sometimes, during the long, cold winter, he felt that  perhaps it would be well for him, now his work was done, to sell his  \"place\" and go down to Boston to live, near his brother. \"But then,\" he  added, \"you know it's dangerous transplanting an old tree; you're likely  as not to kill it.\" Whatever we have, in this world, we must pay for  with the loss of something else. The bitter must be taken with the  sweet, be we plants, animals, or men. These thoughts recurred to me a  day or two later, as I lay on the summit of Mount Agassiz, in the sun  and out of the wind, gazing down into the Franconia Valley, then in all  its June beauty. Nestled under the lee of the mountain, but farther from  the base, doubtless, than it seemed from my point of view, was a small  dwelling, scarcely better than a shanty. Two or three young children  were playing about the door, and near them was the man of the house  splitting wood. The air was still enough for me to hear every blow,  although it reached me only as the axe was again over the man's head,  ready for the next descent. It was a charming picture,--the broad, green  valley full of sunshine and peace, and the solitary cottage, from whose  doorstep might be seen in one direction the noble Mount Washington  range, and in another the hardly less noble Franconias. How easy to live  simply and well in such a grand seclusion! But soon there came a thought  of Wordsworth's sonnet, addressed to just such a mood, \"Yes, there is  holy pleasure in thine eye,\" and I felt at once the truth of his  admonition. What if the cottage really were mine,--mine to spend a  lifetime in? How quickly the poetry would turn to prose!    An hour afterwards, on my way back to the Sinclair House, I passed a  group of men at work on the highway. One of them was a little apart from  the rest, and out of a social impulse I accosted him with the remark, \"I  suppose, in heaven, the streets never will need mending.\" Quick as  thought came the reply: \"Well, I hope not. If I ever _get_ there, I  don't want to work on the _road_.\" Here spoke universal human nature,  which finds its strong argument for immortality in its discontent with  matters as they now are. The one thing we are all sure of is that we  were born for something better than our present employment; and even  those who school themselves most religiously in the virtue of  contentment know very well how to define that grace so as not to  exclude from it a comfortable mixture of \"divine dissatisfaction.\" Well  for us if we are still able to stand in our place and do faithfully our  allotted task, like the mountain spruces and the Bethlehemite  road-mender.

[12] Beside this road (in June, 1883) I found a nest of the  yellow-bellied flycatcher (_Empidonax flaviventris_). It was built at  the base of a decayed stump, in a little depression between two roots,  and was partially overarched with growing moss. It contained four  eggs,--white, spotted with brown. I called upon the bird half a dozen  times or more, and found her a model \"keeper at home.\" On one occasion  she allowed my hand to come within two or three inches of her bill. In  every case she flew off without any outcry or ruse, and once at least  she fell immediately to fly-catching with admirable philosophy. So far  as I know, this is the only nest of the species ever found in New  England outside of Maine. But it is proper to add that I did not capture  the bird.    [13] But by this time the clerk's appearance was, to say the least, not  reprehensibly \"spruce.\" For one thing, what with the moisture and the  sharp stones, he was already becoming jealous of his shoes, lest they  should not hold together till he could get back to the Crawford House.

Much ado there was, God wot:      He would love, and she would not.                          NICHOLAS BRETON.                               PHILLIDA AND CORIDON.      The happiness of birds, heretofore taken for granted, and long ago put  to service in a proverb, is in these last days made a matter of doubt.  It transpires that they are engaged without respite in a struggle for  existence,--a struggle so fierce that at least two of them perish every  year for one that survives.[14] How, then, can they be otherwise than  miserable?    There is no denying the struggle, of course; nor need we question some  real effect produced by it upon the cheerfulness of the participants.  The more rationalistic of the smaller species, we may be sure, find it  hard to reconcile the existence of hawks and owls with the doctrine of  an all-wise Providence; while even the most simple-minded of them can  scarcely fail to realize that a world in which one is liable any day to  be pursued by a boy with a shot-gun is not in any strict sense  paradisiacal.    And yet, who knows the heart of a bird? A child, possibly, or a poet;  certainly not a philosopher. And happiness, too,--is that something of  which the scientific mind can render us a quite adequate description? Or  is it, rather, a wayward, mysterious thing, coming often when least  expected, and going away again when, by all tokens, it ought to remain?  How is it with ourselves? Do we wait to weigh all the good and evil of  our state, to take an accurate account of it _pro_ and _con_, before we  allow ourselves to be glad or sorry? Not many of us, I think. Mortuary  tables may demonstrate that half the children born in this country fail  to reach the age of twenty years. But what then? Our \"expectation of  life\" is not based upon statistics. The tables may be correct, for aught  we know; but they deal with men in general and on the average; they have  no message for you and me individually. And it seems not unlikely that  birds may be equally illogical; always expecting to live, and not die,  and often giving themselves up to impulses of gladness without stopping  to inquire whether, on grounds of absolute reason, these impulses are to  be justified. Let us hope so, at all events, till somebody proves the  contrary.    But even looking at the subject a little more philosophically, we may  say--and be thankful to say it--that the joy of life is not dependent  upon comfort, nor yet upon safety. The essential matter is that the  heart be engaged. Then, though we be toiling up the Matterhorn, or swept  along in the rush of a bayonet charge, we may still find existence not  only endurable, but in the highest degree exhilarating. On the other  hand, if there is no longer anything we care for; if enthusiasm is dead,  and hope also, then, though we have all that money can buy, suicide is  perhaps the only fitting action that is left for us,--unless, perchance,  we are still able to pass the time in writing treatises to prove that  everybody else ought to be as unhappy as ourselves.    Birds have many enemies and their full share of privation, but I do not  believe that they often suffer from _ennui_. Having \"neither storehouse  nor barn,\"[15] they are never in want of something to do. From sunrise  till noon there is the getting of breakfast, then from noon till sunset  the getting of dinner,--both out-of-doors, and without any trouble of  cookery or dishes,--a kind of perpetual picnic. What could be simpler  or more delightful? Carried on in this way, eating is no longer the  coarse and sensual thing we make it, with our set meal-times and  elaborate preparations.    Country children know that there are two ways to go berrying. According  to the first of these you stroll into the pasture in the cool of the  day, and at your leisure pick as many as you choose of the ripest and  largest of the berries, putting every one into your mouth. This is  agreeable. According to the second, you carry a basket, which you are  expected to bring home again well filled. And this method--well, tastes  will differ, but following the good old rule for judging in such cases,  I must believe that most unsophisticated persons prefer the other. The  hand-to-mouth process certainly agrees best with our idea of life in  Eden; and, what is more to the purpose now, it is the one which the  birds, still keeping the garden instead of tilling the ground, continue  to follow.    That this unworldliness of the birds has any religious or theological  significance I do not myself suppose. Still, as anybody may see, there  are certain very plain Scripture texts on their side. Indeed, if birds  were only acute theologians, they would unquestionably proceed to turn  these texts (since they find it so easy to obey them) into the basis of  a \"system of truth.\" Other parts of the Bible must be _interpreted_, to  be sure (so the theory would run); but _these_ statements mean just what  they say, and whoever meddles with them is carnally minded and a  rationalist.    Somebody will object, perhaps, that, with our talk about a \"perpetual  picnic,\" we are making a bird's life one cloudless holiday;  contradicting what we have before admitted about a struggle for  existence, and leaving out of sight altogether the seasons of scarcity,  the storms, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28020"],[0,"History of Woman Suffrage, Volume I (#13)"],[1,"abolition  movement first took alarm, and issued a pastoral letter, warning their  congregations against the influence of such women. The clergy  identified with anti-slavery associations took alarm also, and the  initiative steps to silence the women, and to deprive them of the  right to vote in the business meetings, were soon taken. This action  culminated in a division in the Anti-Slavery Association. In the  annual meeting in May, 1840, a formal vote was taken on the  appointment of Abby Kelly on a business committee and was sustained by  over one hundred majority in favor of woman's right to take part in  the proceedings of the Society. Pending the discussion, clergymen in  the opposition went through the audience, _urging every woman who  agreed with them, to vote against_ the motion, thus asking them to do  then and there, what with fervid eloquence, on that very occasion,  they had declared a sin against God and Scripture for them to do  anywhere. As soon as the vote was announced, and Abby Kelly's right on  the business committee decided, the men, two of whom were clergymen,  asked to be excused from serving on the committee.    Thus Sarah and Angelina Grimke and Abby Kelly, in advocating liberty  for the black race, were early compelled to defend the right of free  speech for themselves. They had the double battle to fight against the  tyranny of sex and color at the same time, in which, however, they  were well sustained by the able pens of Lydia Maria Child and Maria  Weston Chapman. Their opponents were found not only in the ranks of  the New England clergy, but among the most bigoted Abolitionists in  Great Britain and the United States. Many a man who advocated equality  most eloquently for a Southern plantation, could not tolerate it at  his own fireside.    The question of woman's right to speak, vote, and serve on committees,  not only precipitated the division in the ranks of the American  Anti-Slavery Society, in 1840, but it disturbed the peace of the  World's Anti-Slavery Convention, held that same year in London. The  call for that Convention invited delegates from all Anti-Slavery  organizations. Accordingly several American societies saw fit to send  women, as delegates, to represent them in that august assembly. But  after going three thousand miles to attend a World's Convention, it  was discovered that women formed no part of the constituent elements  of the moral world. In summoning the friends of the slave from all  parts of the two hemispheres to meet in London, John Bull never  dreamed that woman, too, would answer to his call. Imagine then the  commotion in the conservative anti-slavery circles in England, when it  was known that half a dozen of those terrible women who had spoken to  promiscuous assemblies, voted on men and measures, prayed and  petitioned against slavery, women who had been mobbed, ridiculed by  the press, and denounced by the pulpit, who had been the cause of  setting all American Abolitionists by the ears, and split their ranks  asunder, were on their way to England. Their fears of these formidable  and belligerent women must have been somewhat appeased when Lucretia  Mott, Sarah Pugh, Abby Kimber, Elizabeth Neal, Mary Grew, of  Philadelphia, in modest Quaker costume, Ann Green Phillips, Emily  Winslow, and Abby Southwick, of Boston, all women of refinement and  education, and several, still in their twenties, landed at last on the  soil of Great Britain. Many who had awaited their coming with much  trepidation, gave a sigh of relief, on being introduced to Lucretia  Mott, learning that she represented the most dangerous elements in the  delegation. The American clergymen who had landed a few days before,  had been busily engaged in fanning the English prejudices into active  hostility against the admission of these women to the Convention. In  every circle of Abolitionists this was the theme, and the discussion  grew more bitter, personal, and exasperating every hour.    The 12th of June dawned bright and beautiful on these discordant  elements, and at an early hour anti-slavery delegates from different  countries wended their way through the crooked streets of London to  Freemasons' Hall. Entering the vestibule, little groups might be seen  gathered here and there, earnestly discussing the best disposition to  make of those women delegates from America. The excitement and  vehemence of protest and denunciation could not have been greater, if  the news had come that the French were about to invade England. In  vain those obdurate women had been conjured to withhold their  credentials, and not thrust a question that must produce such discord  on the Convention. Lucretia Mott, in her calm, firm manner, insisted  that the delegates had no discretionary power in the proposed action,  and the responsibility of accepting or rejecting them must rest on the  Convention.    At eleven o'clock, the spacious Hall being filled, the Convention was  called to order. The venerable Thomas Clarkson, who was to be  President, on entering, was received by the large audience standing;  owing to his feeble health, the chairman requested that there should  be no other demonstrations. As soon as Thomas Clarkson withdrew,  Wendell Phillips made the following motion:         \"That a Committee of five be appointed to prepare a correct list       of the members of this Convention, with instructions to include       in such list, all persons bearing credentials from any       Anti-Slavery body.\"    This motion at once opened the debate on the admission of women  delegates.         Mr. Phillips: When the call reached America we found that it was       an invitation to the friends of the slave of every nation and of       every clime. Massachusetts has for several years acted on the       principle of admitting women to an equal seat with men, in the       deliberative bodies of anti-slavery societies. When the       Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society received that paper, it       interpreted it, as it was its duty, in its broadest and most       liberal sense. If there be any other paper, emanating from the       Committee, limiting to one sex the qualification of membership,       there is no proof; and, as an individual, I have no knowledge       that such a paper ever reached Massachusetts. We stand here in       consequence of your invitation, and knowing our custom, as it       must be presumed you did, we had a right to interpret \"friends of       the slave,\" to include women as well as men. In such       circumstances, we do not think it just or equitable to that       State, nor to America in general, that, after the trouble, the       sacrifice, the self-devotion of a part of those who leave their       families and kindred and occupations in their own land, to come       three thousand miles to attend this World's Convention, they       should be refused a place in its deliberations.         One of the Committee who issued the call, said: As soon as we       heard the liberal interpretation Americans had given to our first       invitation, we issued another as early as Feb. 15, in which the       description of those who are to form the Convention is set forth       as consisting of \"gentlemen.\"         Dr. Bowring: I think the custom of excluding females is more       honored in its breach than in its observance. In this country       sovereign rule is placed in the hands of a female, and one who       has been exercising her great and benignant influence in opposing       slavery by sanctioning, no doubt, the presence of her illustrious       consort at an anti-slavery meeting. We are associated with a body       of Christians (Quakers) who have given to their women a great,       honorable, and religious prominence. I look upon this delegation       from America as one of the most interesting, the most       encouraging, and the most delightful symptoms of the times. I can       not believe that we shall refuse to welcome gratefully the       co-operation which is offered us.    The Rev. J. Burnet, an Englishman, made a most touching appeal to the  American ladies, to conform to English prejudices and custom, so far  as to withdraw their credentials, as it never did occur to the British  and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society that they were inviting ladies. It is  better, said he, that this Convention should be dissolved at this  moment than this motion should be adopted.         The Rev. Henry Grew, of Philadelphia: The reception of women as a       part of this Convention would, in the view of many, be not only a       violation of the customs of England, but of the ordinance of       Almighty God, who has a right to appoint our services to His       sovereign will.         Rev. Eben Galusha, New York: In support of the other side of this       question, reference has been made to your Sovereign. I most       cordially approve of her policy and sound wisdom, and commend to       the consideration of our American female friends who are so       deeply interested in the subject, the example of your noble       Queen, who by sanctioning her consort, His Royal Highness Prince       Albert, in taking the chair on an occasion not dissimilar to       this, showed her sense of propriety by putting her Head foremost       in an assembly of gentlemen. I have no objection to woman's being       the neck to turn the head aright, but do not wish to see her       assume the place of the head.         George Bradburn, of Mass.: We are told that it would be outraging       the customs of England to allow women to sit in this Convention.       I have a great respect for the customs of old England. But I ask,       gentlemen, if it be right to set up the customs and habits, not       to say prejudices of Englishmen, as a standard for the government       on this occasion of Americans, and of persons belonging to       several other independent nations.
