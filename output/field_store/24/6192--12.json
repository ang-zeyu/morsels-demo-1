[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35829"],[0,"The 2009 CIA World Factbook (#13)"],[1,"the United States under Joseph  Smith, Mormonism is not characterized as a form of Protestant  Christianity because it claims additional revealed Christian  scriptures after the Hebrew Bible and New Testament. The Book of  Mormon maintains there was an appearance of Jesus in the New World  following the Christian account of his resurrection, and that the  Americas are uniquely blessed continents. Mormonism believes earlier  Christian traditions, such as the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and  Protestant reform faiths, are apostasies and that Joseph Smith's  revelation of the Book of Mormon is a restoration of true  Christianity. Mormons have a hierarchical religious leadership  structure, and actively proselytize their faith; they are located  primarily in the Americas and in a number of other Western countries.     Orthodox Christianity: The oldest established eastern form of  Christianity, the Holy Orthodox Church, has a ceremonial head in the  Bishop of Constantinople (Istanbul), also known as a Patriarch, but  its various regional forms (e.g., Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox,  Serbian Orthodox, Ukrainian Orthodox) are autocephalous (independent  of Constantinople's authority, and have their own Patriarchs).  Orthodox churches are highly nationalist and ethnic. The Orthodox  Christian faith shares many theological tenets with the Roman  Catholic Church, but diverges on some key premises and does not  recognize the governing authority of the Pope.     Protestant Christianity: Protestant Christianity originated in  the 16th century as an attempt to reform Roman Catholicism's  practices, dogma, and theology. It encompasses several forms or  denominations which are extremely varied in structure, beliefs,  relationship to state, clergy, and governance. Many protestant  theologies emphasize the primary role of scripture in their faith,  advocating individual interpretation of Christian texts without the  mediation of a final religious authority such as the Roman Pope. The  oldest Protestant Christianities include Lutheranism, Calvinism  (Presbyterians), and Anglican Christianity (Episcopalians), which  have established liturgies, governing structure, and formal clergy.  Other variants on Protestant Christianity, including Pentecostal  movements and independent churches, may lack one or more of these  elements, and their leadership and beliefs are individualized and  dynamic.  Hinduism - Originating in the Vedic civilization of India (second  and first millennium B.C.), Hinduism is an extremely diverse set of  beliefs and practices with no single founder or religious authority.  Hinduism has many scriptures; the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the  Bhagavad-Gita are among some of the most important. Hindus may  worship one or many deities, usually with prayer rituals within  their own home. The most common figures of devotion are the gods  Vishnu, Shiva, and a mother goddess, Devi. Most Hindus believe the  soul, or atman, is eternal, and goes through a cycle of birth,  death, and rebirth (samsara) determined by one's positive or  negative karma, or the consequences of one's actions. The goal of  religious life is to learn to act so as to finally achieve  liberation (moksha) of one's soul, escaping the rebirth cycle.  Islam - The third of the monotheistic Abrahamic faiths, Islam  originated with the teachings of Muhammad in the 7th century.  Muslims believe Muhammad is the final of all religious prophets  (beginning with Abraham) and that the Qu'ran, which is the Islamic  scripture, was revealed to him by God. Islam derives from the word  submission, and obedience to God is a primary theme in this  religion. In order to live an Islamic life, believers must follow  the five pillars, or tenets, of Islam, which are the testimony of  faith (shahada), daily prayer (salah), giving alms (zakah), fasting  during Ramadan (sawm), and the pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj).  Basic Groupings     The two primary branches of Islam are Sunni and Shia, which split  from each other over a religio-political leadership dispute about  the rightful successor to Muhammad. The Shia believe Muhammad's  cousin and son-in-law, Ali, was the only divinely ordained Imam  (religious leader), while the Sunni maintain the first three caliphs  after Muhammad were also legitimate authorities. In modern Islam,  Sunnis and Shia continue to have different views of acceptable  schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and who is a proper Islamic  religious authority. Islam also has an active mystical branch,  Sufism, with various Sunni and Shia subsets.      Sunni Islam accounts for over 75% of the world's Muslim  population. It recognizes the Abu Bakr as the first caliph after  Muhammad. Sunni has four schools of Islamic doctrine and law -  Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali - which uniquely interpret the  Hadith, or recorded oral traditions of Muhammad. A Sunni Muslim may  elect to follow any one of these schools, as all are considered  equally valid.      Shia Islam represents 10-20% of Muslims worldwide, and its  distinguishing feature is its reverence for Ali as an infallible,  divinely inspired leader, and as the first Imam of the Muslim  community after Muhammad. A majority of Shia are known as  \"Twelvers,\" because they believe that the 11 familial successor  imams after Muhammad culminate in a 12th Imam (al-Mahdi) who is  hidden in the world and will reappear at its end to redeem the  righteous.  Variants     Ismaili faith: A sect of Shia Islam, its adherents are also known  as \"Seveners,\" because they believe that the rightful seventh Imam  in Islamic leadership was Isma'il, the elder son of Imam Jafar  al-Sadiq. Ismaili tradition awaits the return of the seventh Imam as  the Mahdi, or Islamic messianic figure. Ismailis are located in  various parts of the world, particularly South Asia and the Levant.     Alawi faith: Another Shia sect of Islam, the name reflects  followers' devotion to the religious authority of Ali. Alawites are  a closed, secretive religious group who assert they are Shia  Muslims, although outside scholars speculate their beliefs may have  a syncretic mix with other faiths originating in the Middle East.  Alawis live mostly in Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey.     Druze faith: A highly secretive tradition and a closed community  that derives from the Ismaili sect of Islam; its core beliefs are  thought to emphasize a combination of Gnostic principles believing  that the Fatimid caliph, al-Hakin, is the one who embodies the key  aspects of goodness of the universe, which are, the intellect, the  word, the soul, the preceder, and the follower. The Druze have a key  presence in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.  Jainism - Originating in India, Jain spiritual philosophy believes  in an eternal human soul, the eternal universe, and a principle of  \"the own nature of things.\" It emphasizes compassion for all living  things, seeks liberation of the human soul from reincarnation  through enlightenment, and values personal responsibility due to the  belief in the immediate consequences of one's behavior. Jain  philosophy teaches non-violence and prescribes vegetarianism for  monks and laity alike; its adherents are a highly influential  religious minority in Indian society.  Judaism - One of the first known monotheistic religions, likely  dating to between 2000-1500 B.C., Judaism is the native faith of the  Jewish people, based upon the belief in a covenant of responsibility  between a sole omnipotent creator God and Abraham, the patriarch of  Judaism's Hebrew Bible, or Tanakh. Divine revelation of principles  and prohibitions in the Hebrew Scriptures form the basis of Jewish  law, or halakhah, which is a key component of the faith. While there  are extensive traditions of Jewish halakhic and theological  discourse, there is no final dogmatic authority in the tradition.  Local communities have their own religious leadership. Modern  Judaism has three basic categories of faith: Orthodox, Conservative,  and Reform/Liberal. These differ in their views and observance of  Jewish law, with the Orthodox representing the most traditional  practice, and Reform/Liberal communities the most accommodating of  individualized interpretations of Jewish identity and faith.  Shintoism - A native animist tradition of Japan, Shinto practice is  based upon the premise that every being and object has its own  spirit or kami. Shinto practitioners worship several particular  kamis, including the kamis of nature, and families often have  shrines to their ancestors' kamis. Shintoism has no fixed tradition  of prayers or prescribed dogma, but is characterized by individual  ritual. Respect for the kamis in nature is a key Shinto value. Prior  to the end of World War II, Shinto was the state religion of Japan,  and bolstered the cult of the Japanese emperor.  Sikhism - Founded by the Guru Nanak (born 1469), Sikhism believes in  a non-anthropomorphic, supreme, eternal, creator God; centering  one's devotion to God is seen as a means of escaping the cycle of  rebirth. Sikhs follow the teachings of Nanak and nine subsequent  gurus. Their scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib - also known as the  Adi Granth - is considered the living Guru, or final authority of  Sikh faith and theology. Sikhism emphasizes equality of humankind  and disavows caste, class, or gender discrimination.  Taoism - Chinese philosophy or religion based upon Lao Tzu's Tao Te  Ching, which centers on belief in the Tao, or the way, as the flow  of the universe and the nature of things. Taoism encourages a  principle of non-force, or wu-wei, as the means to live harmoniously  with the Tao. Taoists believe the esoteric world is made up of a  perfect harmonious balance and nature, while in the manifest world -  particularly in the body - balance is distorted. The Three Jewels of  the Tao - compassion, simplicity, and humility - serve as the basis  for Taoist ethics.

Rift Valley fever - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and  humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects;  infection may also occur through handling of infected meat or  contact with blood; geographic distribution includes eastern and  southern Africa where cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are  generally mild with fever and some liver abnormalities, but the  disease may progress to hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or ocular  disease; fatality rates are low at about 1% of cases.  Chikungunya - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease  associated with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever;  characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain  usually lasting 3-7 days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.  water contact diseases acquired through swimming or wading in  freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:  Leptospirosis - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans;  infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil  contaminated by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe  headache, vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease  can result in kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or  respiratory distress; fatality rates are low but left untreated  recovery can take months.  Schistosomiasis - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm  Schistosoma; fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release  larval form of parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed  to contaminated water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood  vessels, liver, kidneys, and intestines releasing eggs, which become  trapped in tissues triggering an immune response; may manifest as  either urinary or intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or  learning capacity; mortality, while generally low, may occur in  advanced cases usually due to bladder cancer; endemic in 74  developing countries with 80% of infected people living in  sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the reservoir for this parasite.  aerosolized dust or soil contact disease acquired through inhalation  of aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:  Lassa fever - viral disease carried by rats of the genus Mastomys;  endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct  contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or  fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50%  in epidemic outbreaks.  respiratory disease acquired through close contact with an  infectious person:  Meningococcal meningitis - bacterial disease causing an inflammation  of the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most  important bacterial pathogens is Neisseria meningitidis because of  its potential to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high  fever, headaches, and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person  to person by respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and  prolonged contact resulting from crowded living conditions, often  with a seasonal distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases,  typically within 24-48 hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of  meningococcal disease occurs in the hyperendemic region of  sub-Saharan Africa known as the \"Meningitis Belt\" which stretches  from Senegal east to Ethiopia.  animal contact disease acquired through direct contact with local  animals:  Rabies - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the  bite of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the  central nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms  initially are non-specific fever and headache progressing to  neurological symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of  symptoms.        Manpower available for military service      This entry gives the number of males and females falling in the  military age range for a country (defined as being ages 16-49) and  assumes that every individual is fit to serve.        Manpower fit for military service      This entry gives the number of males and females falling in the  military age range for a country (defined as being ages 16-49) and  who are not otherwise disqualified for health reasons; accounts for  the health situation in the country and provides a more realistic  estimate of the actual number fit to serve.        Manpower reaching militarily significant age annually      This entry gives the number of males and females entering the  military manpower pool (i.e., reaching age 16) in any given year and  is a measure of the availability of military-age young adults.        Map references      This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference map on which  a country may be found. Note that boundary representations on these  maps are not necessarily authoritative. The entry on Geographic  coordinates may be helpful in finding some smaller countries.        Maritime claims      This entry includes the following claims, the definitions of which  are excerpted from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the  Sea (UNCLOS), which alone contains the full and definitive  descriptions:  territorial sea - the sovereignty of a coastal state extends beyond  its land territory and internal waters to an adjacent belt of sea,  described as the territorial sea in the UNCLOS (Part II); this  sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as  well as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every state has the right  to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not  exceeding 12 nautical miles; the normal baseline for measuring the  breadth of the territorial sea is the mean low-water line along the  coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the  coastal state; the UNCLOS describes specific rules for archipelagic  states.  contiguous zone - according to the UNCLOS (Article 33), this is a  zone contiguous to a coastal state's territorial sea, over which it  may exercise the control necessary to: prevent infringement of its  customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations  within its territory or territorial sea; punish infringement of the  above laws and regulations committed within its territory or  territorial sea; the contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24  nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the  territorial sea is measured (e.g. the US has claimed a 12-nautical  mile contiguous zone in addition to its 12-nautical mile territorial  sea).  exclusive economic zone (EEZ) - the UNCLOS (Part V) defines the EEZ  as a zone beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in which a  coastal state has: sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and  exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether  living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of  the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for  the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the  production of energy from the water, currents, and winds;  jurisdiction with regard to the establishment and use of artificial  islands, installations, and structures; marine scientific research;  the protection and preservation of the marine environment; the outer  limit of the exclusive economic zone shall not exceed 200 nautical  miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial  sea is measured.  continental shelf - the UNCLOS (Article 76) defines the continental  shelf of a coastal state as comprising the seabed and subsoil of the  submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout  the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of  the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from  the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is  measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not  extend up to that distance; the continental margin comprises the  submerged prolongation of the landmass of the coastal state, and  consists of the seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the  rise; wherever the continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical  miles from the baseline, coastal states may extend their claim to a  distance not to exceed 350 nautical miles from the baseline or 100  nautical miles from the 2500 meter isobath; it does not include the  deep ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.  exclusive fishing zone - while this term is not used in the UNCLOS,  some states (e.g., the United Kingdom) have chosen not to claim an  EEZ, but rather to claim jurisdiction over the living resources off  their coast; in such cases, the term exclusive fishing zone is often  used; the breadth of this zone is normally the same as the EEZ or  200 nautical miles.        Market value of publicly traded shares      This entry gives the value of shares issued by publicly traded  companies at a price determined in the national stock markets on the  final day of the period indicated. It is simply the latest price per  share multiplied by the total number of outstanding shares,  cumulated over all companies listed on the particular exchange.        Median age      This entry is the age that divides a population into two numerically  equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than this age and  half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age  distribution of a population. Currently, the median age ranges from  a low of about 15 in Uganda and Gaza Strip to 40 or more in several  European countries and Japan. See the entry for \"Age structure\" for  the importance of a young versus an older age structure and, by  implication, a low versus a higher median age.
