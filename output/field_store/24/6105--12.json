[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30249"],[0,"Ways of Nature (#13)"],[1,"of an animal of our time is the sum of the variations  toward greater intelligence of all its ancestors. What man stores in  language and in books--the accumulated results of experience--the  animals seem to have stored in instinct. As Darwin says, a man cannot,  on his first trial, make a stone hatchet or a canoe through his power  of imitation. \"He has to learn his work by practice; a beaver, on the  other hand, can make its dam or canal, and a bird its nest, as well or  nearly as well, and a spider its wonderful web quite as well, the  first time it tries as when old and experienced.\"    An animal shows intelligence, as distinct from instinct, when it takes  advantage of any circumstance that arises at the moment, when it finds  new ways, whether better or not, as when certain birds desert their  old nesting-sites, and take up with new ones afforded by man. This  act, at least, shows power of choice. The birds and beasts all quickly  avail themselves of any new source of food supply. Their wits are  probably more keen and active here than in any other direction. It is  said that in Oklahoma the coyotes have learned to tell ripe  watermelons from unripe ones by scratching upon them. If they have  not, they probably will. Eating is the one thing that engrosses the  attention of all creatures, and the procuring of food has been a great  means of education to all.    I notice that certain of the wood-folk--mice and squirrels and  birds--eat mushrooms. If I would eat them, I must learn how to  distinguish the edible from the poisonous ones. I have no special  sense to guide me in the matter, as doubtless the squirrels have.  Their instinct is sure where my reason fails. It would be very  interesting to know if they ever make a mistake in this matter.  Domestic animals sometimes make mistakes as to their food because  their instinct has been tampered with and is by no means as sure as  that of the wild creatures. It is said that sheep will occasionally  eat laurel and St. John's-wort, which are poisonous to them. In the  far West I was told that the horses sometimes eat a weed called the  loco-weed that makes them crazy. I have since learned that the  buffaloes and cattle with a strain of the buffalo blood never eat this  weed.    The imitation among the lower animals to which I have referred is in  no sense akin to teaching. The boy does not learn arithmetic by  imitation. To teach is to bring one mind to act upon another mind; it  is the result of a conscious effort on the part of both teacher and  pupil. The child, says Darwin, has an instinctive tendency to speak,  but not to brew, or bake, or write. The child comes to speak by  imitation, as does the parrot, and then learns the meaning of words,  as the parrot does not.    I am convinced there is nothing in the notion that animals consciously  teach their young. Is it probable that a mere animal reflects upon the  future any more than it does upon the past? Is it solicitous about the  future well-being of its offspring any more than it is curious about  its ancestry? Persons who think they see the lower animals training  their young consciously or unconsciously supply something to their  observations; they read their own thoughts or preconceptions into what  they see. Yet so trained a naturalist and experienced a hunter as  President Roosevelt differs with me in this matter. In a letter which  I am permitted to quote, he says:--    \"I have not the slightest doubt that there is a large amount of  _unconscious_ teaching by wood-folk of their offspring. In  unfrequented places I have had the deer watch me with almost as much  indifference as they do now in the Yellowstone Park. In frequented  places, where they are hunted, young deer and young mountain sheep, on  the other hand,--and of course young wolves, bobcats, and the  like,--are exceedingly wary and shy when the sight or smell of man is  concerned. Undoubtedly this is due to the fact that from their  earliest moments of going about they learn to imitate the unflagging  watchfulness of their parents, and by the exercise of some associative  or imitative quality they grow to imitate and then to share the alarm  displayed by the older ones at the smell or presence of man. A young  deer that has never seen a man feels no instinctive alarm at his  presence, or at least very little; but it will undoubtedly learn to  associate extreme alarm with his presence from merely accompanying its  mother, if the latter feels such alarm. I should not regard this as  schooling by the parent any more than I should so regard the instant  flight of twenty antelope who had not seen a hunter, because the  twenty-first has seen him and has instantly run. Sometimes a deer or  an antelope will deliberately give an alarm-cry at sight of something  strange. This cry at once puts every deer or antelope on the alert;  but they will be just as much on the alert if they witness nothing but  an exhibition of fright and flight on the part of the first deer or  antelope, without there being any conscious effort on its part to  express alarm.    \"Moreover, I am inclined to think that on certain occasions, rare  though they may be, there is a conscious effort at teaching. I have  myself known of one setter dog which would thrash its puppy soundly if  the latter carelessly or stupidly flushed a bird. Something similar  may occur in the wild state among such intelligent beasts as wolves  and foxes. Indeed, I have some reason to believe that with both of  these animals it does occur--that is, that there is conscious as well  as unconscious teaching of the young in such matters as traps.\"    Probably the President and I differ more in the meaning we attach to  the same words than in anything else. In a subsequent letter he says:  \"I think the chief difference between you and me in the matter is one  of terminology. When I speak of unconscious teaching, I really mean  simply acting in a manner which arouses imitation.\"    Imitation is no doubt the key to the whole matter. The animals  unconsciously teach their young by their example, and in no other way.  But I must leave the discussion of this subject for another chapter.                                            VI                             ANIMAL COMMUNICATION      The notion that animals consciously train and educate their young has  been held only tentatively by European writers on natural history.  Darwin does not seem to have been of this opinion at all. Wallace  shared it at one time in regard to the birds,--their songs and  nest-building,--but abandoned it later, and fell back upon instinct or  inherited habit. Some of the German writers, such as Brehm, Buechner,  and the Muellers, seem to have held to the notion more decidedly. But  Professor Groos had not yet opened their eyes to the significance of  the play of animals. The writers mentioned undoubtedly read the  instinctive play of animals as an attempt on the part of the parents  to teach their young.    That the examples of the parents in many ways stimulate the imitative  instincts of the young is quite certain, but that the parents in any  sense aim at instruction is an idea no longer held by writers on  animal psychology.    Of course it all depends upon what we mean by teaching. Do we mean the  communication of knowledge, or the communication of emotion? It seems  to me that by teaching we mean the former. Man alone communicates  knowledge; the lower animals communicate feeling or emotion. Hence  their communications always refer to the present, never to the past or  to the future.    That birds and beasts do communicate with each other, who can doubt?  But that they impart knowledge, that they have any knowledge to  impart, in the strict meaning of the word, any store of ideas or  mental concepts--that is quite another matter. Teaching implies such  store of ideas and power to impart them. The subconscious self rules  in the animal; the conscious self rules in man, and the conscious self  alone can teach or communicate knowledge. It seems to me that the  cases of the deer and the antelope, referred to by President Roosevelt  in the letter to me quoted in the last chapter, show the communication  of emotion only.    Teaching implies reflection and judgment; it implies a thought of, and  solicitude for, the future. \"The young will need this knowledge,\" says  the human parent, \"and so we will impart it to them now.\" But the  animal parent has consciously no knowledge to impart, only fear or  suspicion. One may affirm almost anything of trained dogs and of dogs  generally. I can well believe that the setter bitch spoken of by the  President punished her pup when it flushed a bird,--she had been  punished herself for the same offense,--but that the act was  expressive of anything more than her present anger, that she was in  any sense trying to train and instruct her pup, there is no proof.    But with animals that have not been to school to man, all ideas of  teaching must be rudimentary indeed. How could a fox or a wolf  instruct its young in such matters as traps? Only in the presence of  the trap, certainly; and then the fear of the trap would be  communicated to the young through natural instinct. Fear, like joy or  curiosity, is contagious among beasts and birds, as it is among men;  the young fox or wolf would instantly share the emotion of its parent  in the presence of a trap. It is very important to the wild creatures  that they have a quick apprehension of danger, and as a matter of fact  they have. One wild and suspicious duck in a flock will often defeat  the best laid plans of the duck-hunter. Its suspicions are quickly  communicated to all its fellows: not through any conscious effort on  its part to do so, but through the law of natural contagion above  referred to. Where any bird or beast is much hunted, fear seems to be  in the air, and their fellows come to be conscious of the danger which  they have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3029"],[0,"Real Soldiers of Fortune (#13)"],[1,"in need, an engineer named Howard, smuggled Churchill Into a  freight-car, and hid him under sacks of some soft merchandise.    At Komatie-Poort, the station on the border, for eighteen hours the car  in which Churchill lay concealed was left in the sun on a siding, and  before it again started it was searched, but the man who was conducting  the search lifted only the top layer of sacks, and a few minutes later  Churchill heard the hollow roar of the car as it passed over the bridge,  and knew that he was across the border.    Even then he took no chances, and for two days more lay hidden at the  bottom of the car.    When at last he arrived in Lorenzo Marques he at once sought out the  English Consul, who, after first mistaking him for a stoker from one of  the ships in the harbor, gave him a drink, a bath, and a dinner.    As good luck would have it, the _Induna_ was leaving that night for  Durban, and, escorted by a body-guard of English residents armed with  revolvers, and who were taking no chances of his recapture by the Boer  agents, he was placed safely on board. Two days later he arrived at  Durban, where he was received by the Mayor, the populace, and a brass  band playing: \"Britons Never, Never, Never shall be Slaves!\"    For the next month Churchill was bombarded by letters and telegrams  from every part of the globe, some invited him to command filibustering  expeditions, others sent him woollen comforters, some forwarded  photographs of himself to be signed, others photographs of themselves,  possibly to be admired, others sent poems, and some bottles of whiskey.    One admirer wrote: \"My congratulations on your wonderful and glorious  deeds, which will send such a thrill of pride and enthusiasm through  Great Britain and the United States of America, that the Anglo-Saxon  race will be irresistible.\"    Lest so large an order as making the Anglo-Saxon race irresistible might  turn the head of a subaltern, an antiseptic cablegram was also sent him,  from London, reading:    \"Best friends here hope you won't go making further ass of yourself.    \"McNEILL.\"    One day in camp we counted up the price per word of this cablegram, and  Churchill was delighted to find that it must have cost the man who sent  it five pounds.    On the day of his arrival in Durban, with the cheers still in the air,  Churchill took the first train to \"the front,\" then at Colenso. Another  man might have lingered. After a month's imprisonment and the hardships  of the escape, he might have been excused for delaying twenty-four hours  to taste the sweets of popularity and the flesh-pots of the Queen Hotel.  But if the reader has followed this brief biography he will know that  to have done so would have been out of the part. This characteristic of  Churchill's to get on to the next thing explains his success. He has no  time to waste on postmortems, he takes none to rest on his laurels.    As a war correspondent and officer he continued with Buller until the  relief of Ladysmith, and with Roberts until the fall of Pretoria. He  was in many actions, in all the big engagements, and came out of the war  with another medal and clasps for six battles.    On his return to London he spent the summer finishing his second book on  the war, and in October at the general election as a \"khaki\" candidate,  as those were called who favored the war, again stood for Oldham. This  time, with his war record to help him, he wrested from the Liberals one  of Oldham's two seats. He had been defeated by thirteen hundred votes;  he was elected by a majority of two hundred and twenty-seven.    The few months that intervened between his election and the opening of  the new Parliament were snatched by Churchill for a lecturing tour at  home, and in the United States and Canada. His subject was the war and  his escape from Pretoria.    When he came to this country half of the people here were in sympathy  with the Boers, and did not care to listen to what they supposed would  be a strictly British version of the war. His manager, without asking  permission of those whose names he advertised, organized for Churchill's  first appearance in various cities, different reception committees.    Some of those whose names, without their consent, were used for these  committees, wrote indignantly to the papers, saying that while for  Churchill, personally, they held every respect, they objected to being  used to advertise an anti-Boer demonstration.    While this was no fault of Churchill's, who, until he reached this  country knew nothing of it, it was neither for him nor for the success  of his tour the best kind of advance work.    During the fighting to relieve Ladysmith, with General Buller's force,  Churchill and I had again been together, and later when I joined the  Boer army, at the Zand River Battle, the army with which he was a  correspondent had chased the army with which I was a correspondent,  forty miles. I had been one of those who refused to act on his reception  committee, and he had come to this country with a commission from twenty  brother officers to shoot me on sight. But in his lecture he was using  the photographs I had taken of the scene of his escape, and which I had  sent him from Pretoria as a souvenir, and when he arrived I was at the  hotel to welcome him, and that same evening three hours after midnight  he came, in a blizzard, pounding at our door for food and drink. What is  a little thing like a war between friends?    During his \"tour,\" except of hotels, parlor-cars, and \"Lyceums,\" he saw  very little of this country or of its people, and they saw very little  of him. On the trip, which lasted about two months, he cleared ten  thousand dollars. This, to a young man almost entirely dependent for an  income upon his newspaper work and the sale of his books, nearly repaid  him for the two months of \"one night stands.\" On his return to London he  took his seat in the new Parliament.    It was a coincidence that he entered Parliament at the same age as  did his father. With two other members, one born six days earlier than  himself, he enjoyed the distinction of being among the three youngest  members of the new House.    The fact did not seem to appall him. In the House it is a tradition that  young and ambitious members sit \"below\" the gangway; the more modest  and less assured are content to place themselves \"above\" it, at a point  farthest removed from the leaders.    On the day he was sworn in there was much curiosity to see where  Churchill would elect to sit. In his own mind there was apparently no  doubt. After he had taken the oath, signed his name, and shaken the hand  of the Speaker, without hesitation he seated himself on the bench next  to the Ministry. Ten minutes later, so a newspaper of the day describes  it, he had cocked his hat over his eyes, shoved his hands into his  trousers pockets, and was lolling back eying the veterans of the House  with critical disapproval.    His maiden speech was delivered in May, 1901, in reply to David Lloyd  George, who had attacked the conduct of British soldiers in South  Africa. Churchill defended them, and in a manner that from all sides  gained him honest admiration. In the course of the debate he produced  and read a strangely apropos letter which, fifteen years before, had  been written by his father to Lord Salisbury. His adroit use of  this filled H. W. Massingham, the editor of the _Daily News_, with  enthusiasm. Nothing in parliamentary tactics, he declared, since Mr.  Gladstone died, had been so clever. He proclaimed that Churchill would  be Premier. John Dillon, the Nationalist leader, said he never before  had seen a young man, by means of his maiden effort, spring into the  front rank of parliamentary speakers. He promised that the Irish members  would ungrudgingly testify to his ability and honesty of purpose. Among  others to at once recognize the rising star was T. P. O'Connor, himself  for many years of the parliamentary firmament one of the brightest  stars. In _M. A. P._ he wrote: \"I am inclined to think that the dash of  American blood which he has from his mother has been an improvement on  the original stock, and that Mr. Winston Churchill may turn out to be a  stronger and abler politician than his father.\"    It was all a part of Churchill's \"luck\" that when he entered Parliament  the subject in debate was the conduct of the war.    Even in those first days of his career in the House, in debates where  angels feared to tread, he did not hesitate to rush in, but this subject  was one on which he spoke with knowledge. Over the older men who were  forced to quote from hearsay or from what they had read, Churchill had  the tremendous advantage of being able to protest: \"You only read of  that. I was there. I saw it.\"    In the House he became at once one of the conspicuous and picturesque  figures, one dear to the heart of the caricaturist, and one from the  strangers' gallery most frequently pointed out. He was called \"the  spoiled child of the House,\" and there were several distinguished  gentlemen who regretted they were forced to spare the rod. Broderick,  the Secretary for War, was one of these. Of him and of his recruits in  South Africa, Churchill spoke with the awful frankness of the _enfant  terrible_. And although he addressed them more with sorrow than with  anger, to Balfour and Chamberlain he daily administered advice and  reproof, while mere generals and field-marshals, like Kitchener and  Roberts, blushing under new titles, were held up for public reproof and  briefly but severely chastened. Nor, when he saw Lord Salisbury going  astray, did he hesitate in his duty to the country, but took the Prime  Minister by the hand and gently instructed him in the way he should go.    This did not tend to make him popular, but in spite of his unpopularity,  in his speeches against national extravagancies he made so good a fight  that he forced the"]]]
