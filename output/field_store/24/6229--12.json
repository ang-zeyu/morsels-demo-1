The Mergansers, Saw-bills, or Shelldrakes are fish-eating Ducks and  their rounded bills, set with tooth-like projections along the sides,  are of evident use to them in holding their prey.    The River Ducks include such well-known species as the Mallard, Black  Duck, and Widgeon. They differ from the Bay or Sea Ducks in not having  a well-developed web or flap on the hind-toe. As a rule they feed in  shallow water by tipping, standing on their heads, as it were, while  reaching the bottom for food.    The Bay or Sea Ducks have the hind-toe webbed. They feed, as a rule,  in deeper water than the River Ducks, sometimes descending to the  bottom in water over one hundred feet deep. During the winter they  gather in flocks often of several thousand individuals, and frequent  the larger bodies of water.    With both the River and Bay Ducks the sides of the broad, flat bill  are set with gutters which serve as strainers, retaining the mollusks,  seeds and roots of aquatic plants on which these Ducks feed, while the  mud or water taken in with the food is forced out the sides of the  bill as it closes.    Geese are more terrestrial than Ducks and often visit the land to nip  the grass. This is particularly true in the west where large flocks  of, Geese, especially Snow Geese, may be seen feeding on the prairies.  On the water they feed over shallows by tipping and probing the  bottoms.    Swans also feed from the surface of the water either by simply  immersing the head and neck or by half submerging the body, when, with  the tail pointed to the zenith, the length of their reach is greatly  increased.    In spite of their comparatively short wings the large muscles attached  to them give to the AnatidA| great power of flight. Not only do they  make extended journeys, when migrating, without a rest, but they  attain a speed which is surpassed by but few birds. Some of the  smaller species, when alarmed, doubtless flying at the rate of one  hundred miles an hour.    In common with other diving water birds the Ducks, when molting, lose  most of their wing feathers all at once, and for a time are therefore  unable to fly. During this comparatively helpless period the brightly  colored males assume in part the plumage of the females and are  thereby rendered less conspicuous. With the return of the power of  flight, however, they regain their distinctive, male plumage, which is  usually brighter than that of the female. With our Geese and Swans  there is no sexual difference in color.    Most of our Ducks and Geese breed in the north, some within the Arctic  Circle, and winter from the southern limit of frozen water southward.  The American Merganser, Hooded Merganser, Wood Duck, Buffle-head,  Golden-Eyes, Tree Ducks, and possibly Harlequin Duck nest in hollow  trees, at times some distance from the water. The young of the  American Golden-eye and of the Wood Duck have been seen to reach the  water by jumping from the nest-hole and fluttering down in response to  the calls of the parent below. It is said that they are also brought  down in the bill of the old bird, but this statement apparently lacks  confirmation.    The remaining species of our Ducks, Geese, and Swans, nest as a rule,  on the ground generally near water. From five to fifteen and, in the  case of the Fulvous Tree Duck, possibly as many as thirty eggs are  laid. In color they vary from white to buffy and pale olive and are  always uniformly colored. Incubation is performed by the female alone.  The males at this period among most Ducks deserting their mate to  undergo the partial molt before mentioned. While incubating the  females surround their nest with soft down plucked from their bodies  and when leaving the nest to feed, this down is drawn over the eggs  with the double object, doubtless, of concealing them and of keeping  them warm.    With Eider Ducks this down constitutes the larger part of, if not the  entire nest. Saunders states that in Iceland the down in each nest  weighs about one-sixth of a pound. This is gathered by the natives,  who, however, are careful to afford the sitting bird an opportunity to  raise her brood without further molestation.    The collection of Eider down thus furnishes an admirable illustration  of proper economic relations between man and birds. The down is an  important source of income to the natives of the comparatively barren,  northern countries in which the Eiders nest. So long as man can  remember it has been gathered annually. Still the Ducks continue to  return in numbers year after year to the same region, perhaps the  exact spot in which they nested the year before.    Less intelligent methods would perhaps rob the bird of its second, as  well as of its first nest and, unable to reproduce its kind, the  species would become extinct within a comparatively short period.    The evils which would follow such a course are, however, thoroughly  understood. The Ducks, in the first place, are encouraged in every  way. It is said that should one walk into a peasant's cabin and  preempt his cot as a nesting-site, the peasant would gladly give up  his bed to so valuable a visitor.

[Illustration: Fig. 19--A Hind Leg of the Great Brontosaurus, the  Largest of the Dinosaurs.]    The group to which Brontosaurus belongs, including Diplodocus and  Morosaurus, is distinguished by a large, though rather short, body,  very long neck and tail, and, for the size of the animal, a very small  head. In fact, the head was so small and, in the case of Diplodocus, so  poorly provided with teeth that it must have been quite a task, or a  long-continued pleasure, according to the state of its digestive  apparatus, for the animal to have eaten its daily meal.    [Illustration: Fig. 20.--A Single Vertebra of Brontosaurus.]    An elephant weighing 5 tons eats 100 pounds of hay and 25 pounds of  grain for his day's ration; but, as this food is in a comparatively  concentrated form, it would require at least twice this weight of green  fodder.    It is a difficult matter to estimate the weight of a live Diplodocus or  a Brontosaurus, but it is pretty safe to say that it would not be far  from 20 tons, and that one would devour at the very least something over  700 pounds of leaves or twigs or plants each day--more, if the animal  felt really hungry.    But here we must, even if reluctantly, curb our imagination a little and  consider another point: the cold-blooded, sluggish reptiles, as we know  them to-day, do not waste their energies in rapid movements, or in  keeping the temperature of their bodies above that of the air, and so by  no means require the amount of food needed by more active, warm-blooded  animals. Alligators, turtles, and snakes will go for weeks, even months,  without food, and while this applies more particularly to those that  dwell in temperate climes and during their winter hibernation  practically suspend the functions of digestion and respiration, it is  more or less true of all reptiles. And as there is little reason for  supposing that reptiles behaved in the past any differently from what  they do in the present, these great Dinosaurs may, after all, not have  been gifted with such ravenous appetites as one might fancy. Still, it  is dangerous to lay down any hard and fast laws concerning animals, and  he who writes about them is continually obliged to qualify his  remarks--in sporting parlance, to hedge a little, and in the present  instance there is some reason, based on the arrangement of vertebrae and  ribs, to suppose that the lungs of Dinosaurs were somewhat like those of  birds, and that, as a corollary, their blood may have been better  aerated and warmer than that of living reptiles. But, to return to the  question of food.    From the peculiar character of the articulations of the limb-bones, it  is inferred that these animals were largely aquatic in their habits, and  fed on some abundant species of water plants. One can readily see the  advantage of the long neck in browsing off the vegetation on the bottom  of shallow lakes, while the animal was submerged, or in rearing the head  aloft to scan the surrounding shores for the approach of an enemy. Or,  with the tail as a counterpoise, the entire body could be reared out of  water and the head be raised some thirty feet in the air.    Triceratops, he of the three-horned face, had a remarkable skull which  projected backward over the neck, like a fireman's helmet, or a  sunbonnet worn hind side before, while over each eye was a massive horn  directed forward, a third, but much smaller horn being sometimes present  on the nose.    The little \"Horned Toad,\" which isn't a toad at all, is the nearest  suggestion we have to-day of Triceratops; but, could he realize the  ambition of the frog in the fable and swell himself to the dimensions of  an ox, he would even then be but a pigmy compared with his ancient and  distant relative.    So far as mere appearance goes he would compare very well, for while so  much is said about the strange appearance of the Dinosaurs, it is to be  borne in mind that their peculiarities are enhanced by their size, and  that there are many lizards of to-day that lack only stature to be even  more _bizarre_; and, for example, were the Australian Moloch but big  enough, he could give even Stegosaurus \"points\" in more ways than one.    Standing before the skull of Triceratops, looking him squarely in the  face, one notices in front of each eye a thick guard of projecting bone,  and while this must have interfered with vision directly ahead it must  have also furnished protection for the eye. So long as Triceratops faced  an adversary he must have been practically invulnerable, but as he was  the largest animal of his time, upward of twenty-five feet in length, it  is probable that his combats were mainly with those of his own kind and  the subject of dispute some fair female upon whom two rival suitors had  cast covetous eyes. What a sight it would have been to have seen two of  these big brutes in mortal combat as they charged upon each other with  all the impetus to be derived from ten tons of infuriate flesh! We may  picture to ourselves horn clashing upon horn, or glancing from each bony  shield until some skilful stroke or unlucky slip placed one combatant at  the mercy of the other, and he went down before the blows of his  adversary \"as falls on Mount Alvernus a thunder-smitten oak.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 21.--Moloch. A Modern Lizard that Surpasses the  Stegosaurs in All but Size. _From a drawing by J. M. Gleeson._]    A pair of Triceratops horns in the National Museum bears witness to such  encounters, for one is broken midway between tip and base; and that it  was broken during life is evident from the fact that the stump is healed  and rounded over, while the size of the horns shows that their owner  reached a ripe old age.    For, unlike man and the higher vertebrates, reptiles and fishes do not  have a maximum standard of size which is soon reached and rarely  exceeded, but continue to grow throughout life, so that the size of a  turtle, a crocodile, or a Dinosaur tells something of the duration of  its life.    Before quitting Triceratops let us glance for a moment at its skeleton.  Now among other things a skeleton is the solution of a problem in  mechanics, and in Triceratops the head so dominates the rest of the  structure that one might almost imagine the skull was made first and the  body adjusted to it. The great head seems made not only for offence and  defence; the spreading frill serves for the attachment of muscles to  sustain the weight of the skull, while the work of the muscles is made  easier by the fact that the frill reaches so far back of the junction of  head with neck as to largely counterbalance the weight of the face and  jaws. When we restored the skull of this animal it was found that the  centre of gravity lay back of the eye. Several of the bones of the neck  are united in one mass to furnish a firm attachment for the muscles that  support and move the skull, but as the movements of the neck are already  restricted by the overhanging frill, this loss of motion is no  additional disadvantage.    [Illustration: TRICERATOPS PRORSUS Marsh Fig. 22.--Skeleton of  Triceratops.]    To support all this weight of skull and body requires very massive  legs, and as the fore legs are very short, this enables Triceratops to  browse comfortably from the ground by merely lowering the front of the  head.    These forms we have been considering were the giants of the group, but a  commoner species, Thespesius, though less in bulk than those just  mentioned, was still of goodly proportions, for, as he stalked about,  the top of his head was twelve feet from the ground.    Thespesius and his kin seem to have been comparatively abundant, for  they have a wide distribution, and many specimens, some almost perfect,  have been discovered in this country and abroad. No less than  twenty-nine Iguanodons, a European relative of Thespesius, were found in  one spot in mining for coal at Bernissart, Belgium. Here, during long  years of Cretaceous time, a river slowly cut its way through the  coal-bearing strata to a depth of 750 feet, a depth almost twice as  great as the deepest part of the gorge of Niagara, and then, this being  accomplished, began the work of filling up the valley it had excavated.    It was then a sluggish stream with marshy borders, a stream subject to  frequent floods, when the water, turbid with mud and laden with sand,  overflowed its banks, leaving them, as the waters subsided, covered  thickly with mud. Here, amidst the luxuriant vegetation of a  semi-tropical climate, lived and died the Iguanodons, and here the pick  of the miner rescued them from their long entombment to form part of the  treasures of the museum at Brussels.    Like other reptiles, living and extinct, Thespesius was continually  renewing his teeth, so that as fast as one tooth was worn out it was  replaced by another, a point wherein Thespesius had a decided advantage  over ourselves. On the other hand, as there was a reserve supply of  something like 400 teeth in the lower jaw alone, what an opportunity for  the toothache!    And then we have a multitude of lesser Dinosaurs, including the active,  predatory species with sharp claws and double-edged teeth. Megalosaurus,  the first of the Dinosaurs to be really known, was one of these  carnivorous species, and from our West comes a near relative,  Ceratosaurus, the nose-horned lizard, a queer beast with tiny fore legs,  powerful, sharp-clawed hind feet, and well-armed jaws. A most formidable  foe he seems, the more that the hollow bones speak of active movements,  and Professor Cope pictured him, or a near relative, vigorously engaged  in combat with his fellows, or preying upon the huge but helpless  herbivores of the marshes, leaping, biting, and tearing his enemy to  pieces with tooth and claw.
