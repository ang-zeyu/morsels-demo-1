Swartboy remained with him.    Wishing to be as little encumbered as possible on an excursion, intended  to last only for a couple of days, Willem and his companions took with  them but one horse, besides those for the saddle.  This was in the care  of Congo, who, of course, followed his master, \"Baas Willem.\"    Nothing could be more beautiful than the scenes passed through on the  first day of their hunt.  Groves of palms, and other trees, standing  over flower-clad plains on which gnoos, hartebeests, and other antelopes  were browsing in peace.  A flock of gayly-plumaged birds seemed at home  in every tree; and everything presented to their view was such as fancy  might paint for a hunter's paradise.  On that day, our adventurers had  their first view of the lordly giraffe.  Seven of those majestic  creatures were seen coming from some hill that stretched across the  plain.    \"Don't move,\" exclaimed Hendrik, \"and perhaps they will stray near  enough for us to get a shot before we are discovered.\"    On came the graceful animals across the sunlit plain, like living towers  throwing long shadows before them.  The trees in perspective seemed  lower than their crested heads.  When within about two hundred yards of  the hunters, the latter were discovered by them.  Turning suddenly in  their tracks, the giraffes commenced a rapid retreat.    \"Our horses are fresh.  Let us run them down,\" exclaimed Willem.  \"In  spite of what Macora has said, I must kill a giraffe!\"    The three leaped into the saddles, and started in pursuit of the flying  drove, leaving Congo in charge of the pack-horse.    For some time, the horsemen could not perceive that they were gaining on  the camelopards trotting before them in long shambling strides.  They  were not losing ground, however, and this inspired them to greater  speed.    When the chase had been continued for about four miles, and the horses  began to show signs of exhaustion, the pace of the giraffes was also  observed to have become slower.  They, also, were distressed by the rate  at which they had been moving.    \"One of them is mine,\" shouted Willem, as he spurred forward in a final  charge.    A huge stallion, exhibiting more signs of distress than the others, had  fallen into the rear.  The hunters soon came up with him; and,  separating him from the herd, they fired a volley into his massive body.  Their shots should have brought him down; but, instead of this, they  seemed only to reinvigorate his wearied limbs, and he strode on faster  than ever.    The hunters only paused long enough to reload, and then, resuming the  chase, once more overtook the giraffe.    Another volley was fired, Groot Willem taking aim just behind the  animal's shoulder, the others firing skyward towards its head.  The  giraffe stopped suddenly in its tracks, and stood tottering like a  forest-tree about to fall.  Its head began waving wildly, first to the  right and then to the left.  A shuffle or two of its feet for a time,  enabled it to maintain its equilibrium, and then it sank despairingly to  the earth.    Proudly the hunters dismounted by the side of the now prostrate but once  stately creature,--once a moving monument, erected in evidence of its  Creator's wisdom, but now with its form recumbent upon the carpet of the  plain, its legs kicking wildly in the agonies of death.        CHAPTER NINETEEN.    THE CAMELOPARD.    There is perhaps no animal living so graceful in form, more beautiful in  colour, and more stately and majestic in appearance than the camelopard,  now generally known by the French appellation of giraffe.  Measuring  eighteen feet from the hoof of the fore leg to the crest of its crown,  it stands, as an American would express it, \"The tallest animal in  creation.\"  There is but a single species of the giraffe, and from the  elegance and stateliness of its shape, the pleasing variety and  arrangement of its colours, and the mildness of its disposition, its  first appearance in Europe excited considerable interest.    Although this animal was well known to the ancient Romans, and indeed,  played no inconsiderable part in the gorgeous exhibitions of that  luxurious people, yet, with the ultimate overthrow of the Roman Empire,  the camelopard finally disappeared from Europe, and for several  centuries remained a perfect stranger to the civilised world.    It is not until towards the close of the fifteenth century, that we  again hear of the giraffe's appearance,--when it is related that Lorenzo  de Medici exhibited one at Florence.    The first of these animals seen in England was a gift from the Pasha of  Egypt to George the Fourth.  It arrived in 1828, and died during the  following year.    On the 24th of May, 1836, four giraffes were exhibited in the Zoological  gardens at Regent's Park.  They were brought from the south-west of  Kordofan, and were transported to London at an expense of 2386 pounds  three shillings and one penny.    From a casual glance at the giraffe, its fore legs would appear nearly  twice as long as the hind ones, but such is not the case.  This  difference of appearance is caused by the great depth of shoulder,  compared with the hips.  In proportion to the rest of its body, the  camelopard has rather a small head, upheld by a neck nearly six feet in  length, gently tapering towards the crown.  The animal's height,  reckoning from the top of the head to the hoofs of the fore feet, is  about equally divided between neck, shoulders, and legs.  Measured from  the summit of the hips to the hoofs of the hind feet, it rarely exceeds  six and a half, or seven feet.    The head of the giraffe is furnished with a pair of excrescences,  usually called horns, although very unlike the horn of any other animal.  They are of a porous bony texture covered with short, coarse bristles.  Naturalists have, as yet, failed to determine for what purpose these  osseous processes are provided.  They cannot be either for offence or  defence, since they are too easily displaced to afford any resistance in  the case of a collision.    The eyes of the camelopard are worthy of all praise.  They are of large  size, even softer and more gentle than those of the far-famed gazelle,  and so placed that it can see in almost every direction without turning  its head.    All its senses are very acute; and being an animal of timid habit, it  can only be approached by man when mounted upon a fleet horse.    The camelopard feeds on the leaves and blossoms of an umbrella-shaped  tree,--a species of mimosa, called mokhala by the native Africans, and  cameel-doorn (Camelthorn) by the Dutch settlers of the Cape.    As a grasper and feeler, the tongue of the giraffe is used, as the trunk  of the elephants; and its great height enables it to gather the leaves  of the mokhala far beyond the reach of the latter.    The camelopard's skin is exceedingly thick,--often as much as an inch  and a half--and so difficult of penetration, that frequently, twenty or  thirty bullets are required to bring the creature to the ground.  These  wounds it receives and suffers in silence; for the giraffe is dumb.    Unlike that of most other animals, its hairy coat becomes darker with  age.    The colour of the female is somewhat lighter than the male, and she is  also of much inferior stature.    The camelopard can only defend itself by kicking; and it uses its heels  in this way more effectively than any other creature,--the horse not  excepted.  The prominence of its eyes enables it to see behind, when  directing its heels against an enemy, and so secures its taking a  certain aim; while the blow it can give will crush in the skull of a  man, or leave him with a couple of broken ribs.  If unmolested, it is  among the most innocent of animals.    A creature so strangely shaped, and possessing so much speed and  strength, was certainly designed by the Creator for some other use than  browsing upon the leaves of mimosa-trees; but that use, man has not yet  discovered.        CHAPTER TWENTY.    A RACE FOR LIFE.    Leaving the body of the giraffe very reluctantly, (Groot Willem having a  strong desire to take it along with him,) the hunters started off in  search of the river.  Much to their gratification, the Luize, or another  stream equally as large, was seen not far from them, and they rode along  its bank for the purpose of finding a place where they might water their  horses, now thirsty after the long run they had made in chase of the  giraffe.    For about half a mile they found the stream inaccessible, by reason of  the steepness of its banks; but a small pool was discovered a short  distance from the river, and by this they halted to give their weary  horses a little rest.  These also needed food; and it was the intention  to give them an hour or two upon the grass that grew luxuriantly around  the pool.  The saddles were taken off, and the horses turned out to  graze upon it.    \"I suppose that Cong will have sense to pack up and follow us,\" said  Hendrik.    \"Yes,\" answered Groot Willem, \"I think we may expect to see him here  within two hours.\"    \"But are you sure that he can find us?\"    \"Certainly he can,\" replied Willem.  \"He knows that we are bound down  the river, and the stream will guide him.  If not, he has Spoor'em along  with him.  We should probably meet him on his way if we were to go up  the river.\"    \"But we don't want to go up at present,\" said Hendrik.  \"Our way is  down.\"    \"Then we had better stay here till he comes.\"    While they were thus talking, there was heard a dull, heavy sound,  accompanied by a real or fancied vibration of the earth.    The trees in a neighbouring grove appeared to be shaking about,--some  being upset as if a violent hurricane was sweeping down among them.    The horses took"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27933"],[0,"Forest Neighbors: Life Stories of Wild Animals (#13)"],[1,"masculinity. Or, is there  something deeper than that? Has something whispered to these savage  mothers that on their success depends more than their own lives, and  that it is their sacred duty to kill, kill, kill? However that may be,  she proved herself a mighty huntress before the Lord. Her eye was keen,  and her foot was sure, and she made terrible havoc among the rabbits and  partridges.    And yet there were times when even she was hungry and tired and  disheartened. Once, on a clear, keen, cold winter night when all the  great white world seemed frozen to death, she serenaded a land-looker  who had made his bed in a deserted lumber-camp and was trying to sleep.  She had eaten almost nothing for several days, and she knew that her  strength was ebbing. That very evening she had fallen short in a flying  leap at a rabbit, and had seen him dive head-first into his burrow,  safe by the merest fraction of an inch. She had fairly screeched with  rage and disappointment, and as the hours went by and she found no other  game, she grew so blue and discouraged that she really couldn't contain  herself any longer. Perhaps it did her good to have a cry. For two hours  the land-looker lay in his bunk and listened to a wailing that made his  heart fairly sink within him. Now it was a piercing scream, now it was a  sob, and now it died away in a low moan, only to rise again, wilder and  more agonized than ever. He knew without a doubt that it was only some  kind of a cat--knew it just as well as he knew that his compass needle  pointed north. Yet there had been times in his land-looking experience  when he had been ready to swear that the needle was pointing  south-southeast; and to-night, in spite of his certain knowledge that  the voice he heard was that of a lynx or a wild-cat or cougar, he  couldn't help being almost dead sure that it came from a woman in  distress, there was in it such a note of human anguish and despair.  Twice he got half-way out of bed to go to her assistance, and then lay  down again and called himself a fool. At last he could stand it no  longer, and taking a burning brand from the broken stove that stood in  the centre of the room, he went to the door and looked out. The great  arc-light of the moon had checkered the snow-crust with inky shadows,  and patches of dazzling white. The cold air struck him like needles, and  he said to himself that it was no wonder that either a cat or a woman  should cry if she had to stay out in the snow on such a night. The  moaning and wailing ceased as he opened the door, but now two round  spots of flame shone out of a black shadow and stared at him  unwinkingly. The lynx's pupils were wide open, and the golden-yellow  tapeta in the backs of her eyeballs were glowing like incandescent  lamps. It was no woman. No human eyes could ever shine like that. The  land-looker threw the brand with all his might; an ugly snarl came from  the shadow, and he saw a big gray animal go tearing away across the  hard, smooth crust in a curious kind of gallop, taking three or four  yards at a bound, coming down on all four feet at once, and spring  forward again as if she was made of rubber. He shut the door and went  back to bed.    That was the end of the concert, and, as it turned out, it was also the  end of the lynx's troubles, at least for the time being. Half an hour  later, as she was loping along in the moonlight, she thought she heard a  faint sound from beneath her feet. She stood still to listen, and the  next minute she was sure. During the last heavy snow-storm three  partridges had dived into a drift for shelter from the wind and the  cold, and such a thick, hard crust had formed over their heads that they  had not been able to get out again. She resurrected them in short order  and reinterred them after a fashion of her own, and then she went home  to her hollow tree and slept the sleep of those who have done what  Nature tells them to, and whose consciences are clear and whose stomachs  full.    That was her nearest approach to starvation. She never was quite so  hungry again, and in the early spring she had a great piece of luck. Not  very far from her hollow tree she met a buck that had been mortally  wounded by a hunter. He had had strength enough to run away, and to  throw his pursuer off his track, but there was very little fight left in  him. In such a case as this she was quite ready to attack, and it did  not take her long to finish him. Probably it was a merciful release, for  he had suffered greatly in the last few days. Fortunately no wolves or  other large animals found him, and he gave her meat till after the  kittens had come and she had begun to grow well and strong again.    The kittens were a great success--two of the finest she had ever had,  and she had had many. But at first, of course, they were rather  insignificant-looking--just two little balls of reddish-brown fur that  turned over once in a while and mewed for their dinner. Some of the  scientific men say that a new-born baby has no mind, but only a blank  something that appears to be capable of receiving and retaining  impressions, and that may in certain cases have tendencies. There is  reason for thinking that the baby lynxes had tendencies. But imagine, if  you can, what their first impressions were like. And remember that they  were blind, and that if their ears heard sounds they certainly did not  comprehend them. Sometimes they were cold and hungry and lonesome, and  that was an impression of the wrong sort. They did not know what the  trouble was, but something was the matter, that was certain, and they  cried about it, like other babies. Then would come a great, warm,  comforting presence, and all would be right again; and that was a very  pleasant impression, indeed. I don't suppose they knew exactly what had  been done to them. Probably they were not definitely aware that their  empty stomachs had been filled, or that their shrinking, shivering  little bodies were snuggled down in somebody's thick fur coat, or that  somebody's warm red tongue was licking and stroking and caressing them.  Much less could they have known how that big, strong, comforting  somebody came to be there, or how many harmless and guiltless little  lives had been snuffed out to give her life and to enable her to give it  to them. But they knew that all was well with them, and that everything  was just as it should be--and they took another nap.    [Illustration: \"_The hole was suddenly darkened, and a round, hairy face  looked in._\"]    By and by they began to look about for impressions, and were no longer  content with lying still and taking only what came to them. They seemed  to acquire a mental appetite for impressions that was almost as ravenous  as their stomachs' appetite for milk, and their weak little legs were  forced to lift their squat little bodies and carry them on exploring  expeditions around the inside of the hollow tree, where they bumped  their heads against the walls, and stumbled and fell down over the  inequalities of the floor. They got a good many impressions during these  excursions, and some of them were mental and some were physical. And  sometimes they explored their mother, and went scrambling and  sprawling all over her, probably getting about as well acquainted with  her as it is possible to be with a person whom one has never seen. For  their eyes were still closed, and they must have known her only as a  big, kind, loving, furry thing, that fed them, and warmed them, and  licked them, and made them feel good, and yet was almost as vague and  indefinite as something in a dream. But the hour came at last when for  the first time they saw the light of day shining in through the hole in  the side of their tree. And while they were looking at it--and probably  blinking at it--a footstep sounded outside, the hole was suddenly  darkened, and a round, hairy face looked in--a face with big, unwinking  eyes, pointed, tufted ears, and a thick whisker brushed back from under  its chin. Do you suppose they recognized their mother? I don't believe  they did. But when she jumped in beside them, then they knew her, and  the impression they gained that day was one of the most wonderful of  all.    In looks, these kittens of the woods were not so very different from  those of the backyard, except that they were bigger and perhaps a little  clumsier, and that their paws were very large, and their tails very  short and stubby. They grew stronger as the days went on, and their  legs did not wobble quite so much when they went travelling around the  inside of the tree. And they learned to use their ears as well as their  eyes. They knew what their mother's step meant at the entrance, and they  liked to hear her purr.    Other sounds there were which they did not understand so well, and to  most of which they gave little heed--the scream of the rabbit when the  big gray cat leaps on him from behind a bush; the scolding of the red  squirrel, disturbed and angry at the sight, and fearful that he may be  the next victim; the bark of the fox; the rasping of the porcupine's  teeth; and oftenest of all the pleasant rustling and whispering of the  trees, for by this time the sun and the south wind had come back and  done their work, and the voice of the leaves was heard in the land. All  these noises of the woods, and many others besides, came to them from  outside the walls of the tree, from a vast, mysterious region of which  as yet they knew nothing except that their mother often went there. She  was beginning to think that they were big enough and old enough to learn  something more about it, and so one day she led them out of the hole,  and they saw the sunshine, and the blue of the sky, and the green of  the trees, and the whiteness of the sailing clouds, and the beauty of  the Glimmerglass. But I don't think they appreciated the wonder and the  glory of it all, or paid as much"]]]
