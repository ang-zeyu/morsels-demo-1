If the language is not phonetic, the teacher can compose separate  words with the movable alphabet, and then pronounce them, letting the  child repeat by himself the exercise of arranging and rereading them.    In the material there are two movable alphabets. One of them consists  of larger letters, and is divided into two boxes, each of which  contains the vowels. This is used for the first exercises, in which  the child needs very large objects in order to recognize the letters.  When he is acquainted with one half of the consonants he can begin to  compose words, even though he is dealing with one part only of the  alphabet.    The other movable alphabet has smaller letters and is contained in a  single box. It is given to children who have made their first attempts  at composition with words, and already know the complete alphabet.    It is after these exercises with the movable alphabet that the child  _is able to write entire words_. This phenomenon generally occurs  unexpectedly, and then a child who has never yet traced a stroke or a  letter on paper _writes several words in succession_. From that moment  he continues to write, always gradually perfecting himself. This  spontaneous writing takes on the characteristics of a _natural_  phenomenon, and the child who has begun to write the \"first word\" will  continue to write in the same way as he spoke after pronouncing the  first word, and as he walked after having taken the first step. The  same course of inner formation through which the phenomenon of writing  appeared is the course of his future progress, of his growth to  perfection. The child prepared in this way has entered upon a course  of development through which he will pass as surely as the growth of  the body and the development of the natural functions have passed  through their course of development when life has once been  established.    For the interesting and very complex phenomena relating to the  development of writing and then of reading, see my larger works.          THE READING OF MUSIC      [Illustration: FIG. 32.--THE MUSICAL STAFF.[A]]    -----      [A] The single staff is used in the Conservatoire of Milan and        utilized in the Perlasca method.    -----    When the child knows how to read, he can make a first application of  this knowledge to the reading of the names of musical notes.    In connection with the material for sensory education, consisting of  the series of bells, we use a didactic material, which serves as an  introduction to musical reading. For this purpose we have, in the  first place, a wooden board, not very long, and painted pale green. On  this board the staff is cut out in black, and in every line and space  are cut round holes, inside each of which is written the name of the  note in its reference to the treble clef.    There is also a series of little white discs which can be fitted into  the holes. On one side of each disc is written the name of the note  (doh, re, mi, fah, soh, lah, ti, doh).    The child, guided by the name written on the discs, puts them, with  the name uppermost, in their right places on the board and then reads  the names of the notes. This exercise he can do by himself, and he  learns the position of each note on the staff. Another exercise which  the child can do at the same time is to place the disc bearing the  name of the note on the rectangular base of the corresponding bell,  whose sound he has already learned to recognize by ear in the  sensorial exercise described above.    [Illustration: FIG. 39.--DUMB KEYBOARD.]    Following this exercise there is another staff made on a board of  green wood, which is longer than the other and has neither indentures  nor signs. A considerable number of discs, on one side of which are  written the names of the notes, is at the disposal of the child. He  takes up a disc at random, reads its name and places it on the staff,  with the name underneath, so that the white face of the disc shows on  the top. By the repetition of this exercise the child is enabled to  arrange many discs on the same line or in the same space. When he has  finished, he turns them all over so that the names are outside, and so  finds out if he has made mistakes. After learning the treble clef the  child passes on to learn the bass with great ease.    To the staff described above can be added another similar to it,  arranged as is shown in the figure. (Fig. 32.) The child beginning  with doh, lays the discs on the board in ascending order in their  right position until the octave is reached: doh, re, mi, fah, soh,  lah, ti, doh. Then he descends the scale in the same way, returning to  _doh_, but continuing to place the discs always to the right: soh,  fah, mi, re, doh. In this way he forms an angle. At this point he  descends again to the lower staff, ti, lah, soh, fah, mi, re, doh,  then he ascends again on the other side: re, mi, fah, soh, lah, ti,  and by forming with his two lines of discs another angle in the bass,  he has completed a rhombus, \"the rhombus of the notes.\"    After the discs have been arranged in this way, the upper staff is  separated from the lower. In the lower the notes are arranged  according to the bass clef. In this way the first elements of musical  reading are presented to the child, reading which corresponds to  _sounds_ with which the child's ear is already acquainted.    For a first practical application of this knowledge we have used in  our schools a miniature pianoforte keyboard, which reproduces the  essentials of this instrument, although in a simplified form, and so  that they are visible. Two octaves only are reproduced, and the keys,  which are small, are proportioned to the hand of a little child of  four or five years, as the keys of the common piano are proportioned  to those of the adult. All the mechanism of the key is visible. (Fig.  39.) On striking a key one sees the hammer rise, on which is written  the name of the note. The hammers are black and white, like the  notes.    With this instrument it is very easy for the child to practise alone,  finding the notes on the keyboard corresponding to some bar of written  music, and following the movements of the fingers made in playing the  piano.    The keyboard in itself is mute, but a series of resonant tubes,  resembling a set of organ-pipes, can be applied to the upper surface,  so that the hammers striking these produce musical notes corresponding  to the keys struck. The child can then pursue his exercises with the  control of the musical sounds.      DIDACTIC MATERIAL FOR MUSICAL READING.    [Illustration: FIG. 33.    On the wooden board, round spaces are cut out  corresponding to the notes. Inside each of the spaces there is a figure.  On one side of each of the discs is written a number and on the other the  name of the note. They are fitted by the child into the corresponding  places.]    [Illustration: FIG. 34.    The child next arranged the discs in the notes cut out on  the staff, but there are no longer numbers written to help him find the  places. Instead, he must try to remember the place of the note on the  staff. If he is not sure he consults the numbered board (Fig. 33).]    [Illustration: FIG. 35.    The child arranged on the staff the semitones in the  spaces which remain where the discs are far apart: do-re, re-mi, fah-soh,  soh-la, la-ti. The discs for the semitones have the sharp on one side and  the flat on the other, e.g., re[sharp]-mi[flat] are written on the  opposite sides of the same disc.]    [Illustration: FIG. 36.    The children take a large number of discs and arrange them  on the staff, leaving uppermost the side which is blank, i.e., the side  on which the name of the note is not written. Then they verify their work  by turning the discs over and reading the name.]    [Illustration: FIG. 37.    The double staff is formed by putting the two staves  together. The children arrange the notes in the form of a rhombus.]    [Illustration: FIG. 38.    The two boards are then separated and the notes remain  arranged according to the treble and bass clefs. The corresponding key  signatures are then placed upon the two different staves.]          ARITHMETIC      The children possess all the instinctive knowledge necessary as a  preparation for clear ideas on numeration. The idea of quantity was  inherent in all the material for the education of the senses: longer,  shorter, darker, lighter. The conception of identity and of difference  formed part of the actual technique of the education of the senses,  which began with the recognition of identical objects, and continued  with the arrangement in gradation of similar objects. I will make a  special illustration of the first exercise with the solid insets,  which can be done even by a child of two and a half. When he makes a  mistake by putting a cylinder in a hole too large for it, and so  leaves _one_ cylinder without a place, he instinctively absorbs the  idea of the absence of _one_ from a continuous series. The child's  mind is not prepared for number \"by certain preliminary ideas,\" given  in haste by the teacher, but has been prepared for it by a process of  formation, by a slow building up of itself.    To enter directly upon the teaching of arithmetic, we must turn to the  same didactic material used for the education of the senses.    Let us look at the three sets of material which are presented after  the exercises with the solid insets, _i.e._, the material for teaching  _size_ (the pink cubes), _thickness_ (the brown prisms), and _length_  (the green rods). There is a definite relation between the ten pieces  of each series. In the material for length the shortest piece is a  _unit of measurement_ for all the rest; the second piece is double the  first, the third is three times the first, etc., and, whilst the scale  of length increases by ten centimeters for each piece, the other  dimensions remain"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29728"],[0,"Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome (#13)"],[1,"only,  provided, however, that our present knowledge of nutrition be correct  and final. This knowledge, as a matter of fact, is being revised and  changed constantly.    If dietetics, therefore, were important enough to have any bearing at  all upon the well-defined methods of cookery, we might go into detail  analyzing ancient methods from that point of view. To call attention  to the \"economy,\" the stewardship, or craftsmanship, in ancient  methods and to the truly remarkable intuition that guided the ancient  cooks is more important. Without these qualities there can be no  higher gastronomy. Without high gastronomy no high civilization is  possible. The honest and experienced nutrition expert, though perhaps  personally opposed to elaborate dining, will discover through close  study of the ancient precepts interesting pre-scientific and  well-balanced combinations and methods designed to jealously guard the  vitamins and dietetic values in dishes that may appear curiously \"new\"  to the layman that would nevertheless receive the unqualified approval  of modern science.    We respect the efforts of modern dietitians and food reformers; but we  are far removed from the so-called \"simple\" and \"plain\" foods  advocated by some well-meaning individuals. With the progress of  civilization we are farther and farther drifting away from it. Even  barbaric and beastly food is not \"simple.\"    This furtive \"intuition\" in cookery (in the absence of scientific  facts because of the inability of cooks to transform empirical  traditions into practical rules emanating from understood principles)  still prevails today. It guides great chefs, saves time spent in  scientific study.    The much criticized \"unnatural union of sugar and meats\" of the  ancients still exists today in many popular examples of cookery: lamb  and mint sauce, steak and catsup, mutton and currant jelly, pork and  apples (in various forms), oyster cocktail, poultry and compote, goose  with apple and raisin dressing, venison and Cumberland sauce, mince  pie, plum pudding--typical survivals of ancient traditions.  \"Intuition\" is still preceding exact science, and \"unnatural unions\"  as in social, political and any other form of life, seem to be the  rule rather than the exception.      DISGUISING FOODS    Apicius is often blamed for his endeavor to serve one thing under the  guise of another. The reasons for such deceptions are various ones.  Fashion dictated it. Cooks were not considered \"clever\" unless they  could surprise guests with a commonplace food material so skillfully  prepared that identification was difficult or impossible. Another  reason was the absence of good refrigeration, making \"masking\"  necessary. Also the ambition of hosts to serve a cheaper food for a  more expensive one--veal for chicken, pork for partridge, and so on.  But do we not indulge in the same \"stunts\" today? We either do it with  the intention of deceiving or to \"show off.\" Have we not \"Mock Turtle  Soup,\" _Mouton a la Chasseur_, mutton prepared to taste like venison,  \"chicken\" salad made of veal or of rabbit? In Europe even today much  of the traditional roast hare is caught in the alley, and it belongs  to a feline species. \"Roof hare.\"      FOOD ADULTERATIONS    There is positive evidence of downright frauds and vicious food  adulteration in the times of Apicius. The old rascal himself is not  above giving directions for rose wine without roses, or how to make a  spoiled honey marketable, and other similar adulterations. Those of  our readers with sensitive gastronomic instinct had better skip the  paragraphs discussing the treatment of \"birds with a goatish smell.\"  But the old food adulterators are no match for their modern  successors.    Too, some of our own shams are liable to misinterpretation. In  centuries to come our own modern recipes for \"Scotch Woodcock\" or  \"Welsh rabbit\" may be interpreted as attempts on our part to hoodwink  guests by making game birds and rabbits out of cheese and bread, like  Trimalchio's culinary artists are reputed to have made suckling pigs  out of dough, partridges of veal, chicken of tunny fish, and _vice  versa_. What indeed would a serious-minded research worker a thousand  years hence if unfamiliar with our culinary practice and traditions  make of such terms as _pette de nonne_ as found in many old French  cookery books, or of the famous _suttelties_ (subtleties)--the  confections once so popular at medieval weddings?    The ramifications of the _lingua coquinaria_ in any country are  manifold, and the culinary wonderland is full of pitfalls even for the  experienced gourmet.      REACHING THE LIMIT    Like in all other branches of ancient endeavor, cookery had reached a  state of perfection around the time of Apicius when the only chance  for successful continuation of the art lay in the conquest of new  fields, i.e., in expansion, generalization, elaboration and in  influence from foreign sources. We have witnessed this in French  cookery which for the last hundred years has successfully expanded and  has virtually captured the civilized parts of the globe, subject  however, always to regional and territorial modifications.    This desirable expansion of antique cookery did not take place. It was  violently and rather suddenly checked principally by political and  economic events during the centuries following Apicius, perhaps  principally by the forces that caused the great migration (the very  quest of food!). Suspension ensued instead. The heirs to the ancient  culture were not yet ready for their marvelous heritage. Besides their  cultural unpreparedness, the cookery of the ancients, like their  humor, did not readily appeal to the \"Nordic\" heirs. Both are so  subtle and they depend so much upon the psychology and the economic  conditions of a people, and they thus presented almost unsurmountable  obstacles to the invaders. Still lo! already in the fifth century, the  Goth Vinithaharjis, started to collect the Apician precepts.      OUR PREDECESSORS    The usefulness in our days of Apicius as a practical cookery book has  been questioned, but we leave this to our readers to decide after the  perusal of this translation.    If not useful in the kitchen, if we cannot grasp its moral, what,  then, is Apicius? Merely a curio?    The existing manuscripts cannot be bought; the old printed editions  are highly priced by collectors, and they are rare. Still, the few  persons able to read the messages therein cannot use them: they are  not practitioners in cookery.    None of the Apician editors (except Danneil and the writer) were  experienced practising gastronomers. Humelbergius, Lister, Bernhold  were medical men. Two serious students, Schuch and Wuestemann, gave up  academic positions to devote a year to the study of modern cookery in  order to be able to interpret Apicius. These enthusiasts overlooked,  however, two facts: Apicius cannot be understood by inquiring into  modern average cookery methods, nor can complete mastery of cookery,  practical as well as theoretical, including the historical and  physiological aspects of gastronomy be acquired in one year. Richard  Gollmer, another Apicius editor, declares that the results of this  course in gastronomy were negative. We might add here that Schuch's  edition of Apicius, apart from the unwarranted inclusion of the  _excerpta_ of Vinidarius is the least reliable of all editions.    Gollmer published a free version of Apicius in German in 1909. If he  did not render the original very faithfully and literally, it must  be said in all fairness that his methods of procedure were correct.  Gollmer attempted to interpret the ancient text for the modern  reader. Unfortunately he based his work upon that of Schuch and  Wuestemann and Lister. A year or so later Eduard Danneil published a  version of his own, also based on Schuch. This editor is a  practising _chef_,--_Hof-Traiteur_ or caterer to the court of one of  the then reigning princes of Germany. Danneil's preface is dated  1897, though the date of publication is 1911. In view of the fact  that Gollmer had covered the ground and that Danneil added nothing  new to Apician lore, his publication seems superfluous. Danneil's  translation differs in that the translator adhered literally to the  questionable Schuch version whereas Gollmer aspired to a free and  readable version for an educated public.    A comparison reveals that the one author is not a cook while the other  is not a savant.    Like the scholars who tried their hand at cookery, there are a number  of worthy and ambitious practitioners of cookery who have endeavored  to reach the heights of scholarship, among them Careme and Soyer, men  of great calibre. Unfortunately, the span of human life is short, the  capacity of the human mind is limited. Fruitful achievements in widely  different fields of endeavor by one man are rare. This is merely to  illustrate the extreme difficulty encountered by anyone bent on a  venturesome exploration of our subject and the very narrow chances of  success to extricate himself with grace from the two-thousand year old  labyrinth of philosophical, historical, linguistical and gastronomical  technicalities.    This task will become comparatively easy, however, and surely  interesting and with a foreboding of many delights and surprises if we  penetrate the jungle aided by the experience of predecessors,  steadfastly relying on the \"theory of evolution\" as a guide, and armed  with the indispensable equipment for gastronomical research, i.e., the  practical and technical knowledge of cookery, mastery of languages,  augmented by practical experience gathered by observations and travel  in many lands, and last but not least, if we are obsessed with the  fixed idea that so menial a subject is worth all the bother.    We have purposely refrained from presenting here a treatise in the  customary scientific style. We know,"]]]
