The total quantity of British wool and woollen yarn exported from the  United Kingdom in 1832 was, of the former, 4,199,825 lb.; of the  latter, 2,204,464 lb. The exportation of British woollen manufactures  in 1832 was as follows:--Cloths of all sorts, 396,661 pieces; napped  countings, doffels, &c., 23,453 pieces; kerseymeres, 40,984 pieces;  baizes, 34,874 pieces; stuffs, woollen or worsted, 1,800,714 pieces;  flannel, 2,304,750 yards; blankets and blanketing, 1,681,840 yards;  carpets and carpeting, 690,042 yards; woollens mixed with cotton,  1,334,072 yards; stockings, woollen or worsted, 152,810 dozen pairs.  Sundries, viz., hosiery, rugs, coverlids, tapes, and smallwares,  L55,443 1s. 8d. value. Declared value of British woollen manufactures  exported, L5,244,478 10s. 10d.\"[9]            [9] Quarterly Journal of Agriculture, No. 24.    \"The total quantity of wool imported into the United Kingdom, in the  year 1835, was by weight 42,208,949 pounds, which is rather more than  4,000,000 pounds under the importation of 1834; but on the 5th  January, 1835, 6,494,266 pounds remained warehoused under bond;  whereas, on the 5th January, 1836, there were no more than 2,846,014  pounds so locked up. This is an important difference of stock on hand,  which, no doubt, has tended, and will tend, to keep up the price of  the article. The country from which we import the greatest quantity of  wool is Germany. In 1835, the amount was nearly 24,000,000 pounds  weight. From Russia, to which our exports of manufactured woollens is  comparatively small, we imported upwards of 4,000,000 pounds; from New  South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, taken together, about 209,000  pounds weight more than from Russia. The next largest importations are  from Spain, Turkey, and Italy, which, taken together, supply us with  nearly 4,000,000 pounds. Portugal furnishes 683,000 pounds; Holland,  201,000 pounds; and Belgium, 231,000 pounds. Of the foreign wool which  we have imported, we re-exported in its unmanufactured state 4,101,700  pounds during 1835. And of the total quantity imported in 1835, we  retained for manufacture 41,718,514 pounds. This is nearly 1,000,000  pounds more than was taken up by the manufacturers in the preceding  year.    \"The whole amount of British wool _exported_ in 1835, was 4,642,604  pounds, and of this 3,000,000 pounds were sent to Belgium, and  1,500,000 pounds to France.    \"In 1835, the 'declared value' (which, be it observed, is a real  thing, and very different from the 'official value,' which is of no  use except as an indication of quantity)--the total declared value was  L6,840,511; and of this amount upwards of L2,600,000 worth of woollen  goods went to the United States alone. Next after the United States in  the scale of our customers for woollens comes the East Indies and  China. To these we send the value of upwards of L800,000; to our North  American colonies the value of L418,000; and to the West Indies,  L114,200 worth.    \"In Europe, our best customer is Germany, which, in 1835, took  L631,000 worth. Besides the more fully manufactured goods, Germany  took from us, in the same year, 1,191,000 pounds weight of woollen  yarn. Of European customers, next after Germany come Portugal, which  took, in 1835, to the amount of L368,000; Holland, L245,629; Italy,  L243,582; and Belgium, L123,727. Russia took only L93,025 worth of  woollen goods. The South American States begin to be good customers;  Brazil took, in 1835, L337,788 worth, and Mexico and other States,  L356,700 worth.    \"Looking at the aggregate, the export of 1835 was fully a million  sterling in value above that of 1834; but as the price was higher in  1835, this is no certain guide to the proportion of increase in  _quantity_. In the year 1835, we exported to France only L68,000 worth  of woollen manufactures.    \"We have already stated the _exports_ of woollen goods to the South  American States in 1835; the _import_ of unmanufactured wool from  these States in the same year was L2,176,000 pounds; from France it  was 104,000 pounds.    \"We have only to add, as fiscal information connected with the  foregoing analysis, that of the wool imported in 1835, 26,877,780  pounds paid to the revenue a duty of a penny per pound; 10,198,526  pounds paid one halfpenny per pound; and 6,397 pounds of 'red wool'  paid sixpence per pound.    \"The wool imported from British possessions does not pay duty. Of that  there were, in 1835, 4,635,811 pounds imported.\"          CHAPTER IV.    IMPROVEMENT OF THE BREEDS.      (63.) This subject requires for its due consideration some slight  attainments in anatomy and physiology, but as such attainments, slight  though they may be, are as rarely met with as required among the bulk  of mankind, so the want of them may be the less regretted, seeing it  is possible to render even the intricacies of the study plain and  simple, by an appeal to facts of every-day occurrence; which, having  attracted the notice of the most unthinking, will serve as hooks on  which I shall try to hang the better part of an interesting inquiry.    (64.) _Early Improvers of Sheep._--There cannot be a more certain sign  of the rapid advances of a people in civilization and prosperity, than  increasing attention to the improvement of live-stock. It tells of a  population limited in regard to soil, and making every effort to  remedy the want, by an economical doubling of the return for the usual  outlay: for, while a tribe wanders at large, remaining at a particular  place only so long as provender holds out, and, striking the tent,  departs for some far-off field, so long will their flocks be suffered  to roam neglected, and flourish or decay, as chance directs.    From the time of Jacob, the possibility of determining the nature of  the offspring, by impressions on the parents, has been apparent to  all; and the best means of perpetuating a good quality, or removing a  bad one, have continued from time to time, to occupy the attention of  patriotic individuals. As much appears to have been known about sheep  two thousand years ago as at present, so true is it, that nothing new  is to be met with; yet, that does not rob our modern improvers of  their merits, for though they deserve little as inventors, they are to  be admired for that strength of mind, and determined perseverance,  which enabled them to rouse their fellows from their lethargy, and  compel them to become in turn, benefactors of their country, and  themselves. The signs of a good ram are concisely laid down by Varro,  by Virgil in his third Georgic, and by Columella; and, though the  Spanish nobility were looked upon with wonder, (till eclipsed by our  own extravagance,) in giving two hundred ducats, or fifty pounds for a  ram; yet Strabo assures us, that in his day (under Tiberius), they  gave more than three times that sum for one of the breed of the  Coraxi, a Pontic nation, believed to have the finest fleece in the  world.    The greatest recorded improvers of the sheep in ancient times were  Lucius Columella, and his uncle Marcus Columella, Spaniards of  distinction, who removed to Rome in the reign of Tiberius, and made  agriculture the study and business of their lives. The former  commenced his celebrated treatise on husbandry during the reigns of  Tiberius, and Caligula, and appears to have finished it A.D. 55. It is  a work which may be read with advantage even at present, as it abounds  with much that is valuable, and is accessible to all through its  English translation.[10]            [10] I allude to this, as the author of the work on Sheep,          published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful          Knowledge, at page 123 of that book, laments the want of an          English translation of Columella. An excellent quarto          translation of his twelve books on Husbandry, and one on          Trees, was published at London, in 1745.    (65.) _Modern Breeders._--It is only within a very recent period, that  the mode of improving live-stock by skilful breeding, has been properly  attended to. The perfection of breeding formerly, was to have cows in  calf once a-year, and rear calves on as little milk as possible; and,  even yet, there are only a scattered few who devote to it the attention  it requires. The first, in modern times, who arrived at any thing like  eminence in this department, was Joseph Allom, of Clifton, who raised  himself by dint of industry, from a ploughboy, and for a long time  contrived to keep his methods secret, being supposed by many to have  bought his ewes in Lincolnshire, at the very time he was constantly  bringing them from the Melton quarter of Leicestershire. Though  possessing talent, he does not appear to have had education enough to  avail himself of it, and accordingly never gained the extensive  popularity which fell to the lot of his successors.    As the introducers of new and important plans of management in  agriculture, are always rewarded by large profits, and the gratitude of  their countrymen, so none were ever more generously dealt with in  either respect, than Mr Robert Bakewell, of Dishley, and Mr Ellman, of  Glynde. The former, who may be said to have created a _variety_,  considered that a tendency to acquire fat was the first quality to be  looked to in an animal destined for the food of man; and on this, with  him a fundamental principle, was based the whole of his proceedings.  Different opinions will of course be held on the merits of the theory  on which he acted but all must acknowledge, that we are indebted to his  skill and experience, for the exertions which have been subsequently  made to improve the qualities of live-stock, in every district of the  kingdom. It was by his example, in fact, that the farmers all over the  country were stimulated to exertion, and be the system bad or good, it  ought to have our veneration, seeing that it was the commencement of a  new and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3819"],[0,"The Euahlayi Tribe: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia (#13)"],[1,"slept that night, looked a better colour the next morning, and  rapidly recovered.    We think old Bootha must be a good physician and a ventriloquist, only  I believe it is said ventriloquists cannot live long, and Bootha is now  over eighty.    Others besides wirreenuns see spirits sometimes, but rarely, though  wirreenuns are said to have the power to conjure them up in a form  visible to ordinary eyes.    Babies are said to see spirits when they are smiling or crowing as if  to themselves; it's to some spirit visible to them but to no one else.    When a baby opens his hands and shuts them again quickly, smiling all  the while, that baby is with the spirits catching crabs!    Dogs see spirits; when they bark and howl suddenly and you see nothing  about, it is because they have seen a spirit.    One person may embody many spirits, but such an one must be careful not  to drink anything hot or heating, such would drive out the spirits at  once. The spirits would never enter a person defiled by the white man's  'grog.'    Old Bootha had an interview with a very powerful spirit after she was  ill, who told her that the spirit of her father was now in Bahloo, the  moon; and that it was this spirit which had cured her, and if she kept  his commands she would live for ever. The commands were never to drink  'grog,' never to wear red, never to eat fish. This was told her fifteen  years ago, never once has she transgressed; her vigour for an old woman  considerably over eighty is marvellous.    She was going away for a trip. Before going she said, as she would not  be able to know when I wanted rain for my garden, she would put two  posts in it which had in them the spirits of Kurreahs, or crocodiles.  As these spirits required water I might be certain my tanks would never  go dry while they were on guard. She asked one of my Black-but-Comelys,  a very stalwart young woman, to help her lift one of these posts into  the garden where she wanted to erect it. The girl took hold of one end,  but in a little while dropped it, said it was too heavy. Old Bootha got  furious.    'I get the spirits to help me,' she said, and started a little  sing-song, then shouldered the post herself and carried it in. These  posts are painted red, black, and white, with a snaky pattern, the  Kurreah sign, on them. She also planted in my garden two other  witch-poles, one painted red and having a cross-bar about midway down  it from which raddled strings were attached to the top; this was to  keep away the Euloowayi, black fellows possessed of devils, who came  from behind the sunset.    The other was a plain red-painted, tapering pine-pole which she said,  when it fell to the ground, would tell of the death of some one related  to an inmate of the house. Should it lean towards the house it foretold  misfortune; or if she were any time away, when she was returning she  would send her Mullee Mullee to sit on the top and bend it just to let  us know. This pole would also keep away the spirits of the dead from  the house during her absence. While she was away there would be no one  to come and clear the place of evil by smoking the Budtha twigs all  round it, as she always did if I were alone and, she thought, in need  of protection.    Old Bootha has what she calls a wi-mouyan, clever-stick. It is about  six feet long, great lumps of beefwood gum making knobs on it at  intervals; between each knob it is painted. Armed with this stick, a  piece of crystal, some green twigs, and sometimes a stick with a bunch  of feathers on top, and a large flat stone, she goes out to make rain.  The crystal and stone she puts under the water in the creek, the  feathered stick she erects on the edge of the water, then goes in and  splashes about with green twigs, singing all the time.    After a while she gets out and parades the bank with the wi-mouyan,  singing a rain-song which charms some of the water out of the creek  into the clouds, whence it falls where she directs it. Once my garden  of roses looked very wilted. I asked Bootha to make rain, but just then  she was very offended with Matah. One of her dogs had been poisoned,  she would make no rain on his country. However, at last she said she  would make some for me. I bound her down to a certain day. The day  came; a heavy storm fell just over my garden, filling the ground tank,  which was almost empty. About two inches fell. Within half a mile of  each side of the garden the dust was barely laid.    Old Bootha's luck stuck to her that time, and I had to give her a new  dress and some 'bacca.' But during the last drought she failed  signally. Her excuse for failing was that a great wirreenun up the  creek was so angry with the white people who were driving away all emu,  kangaroo, and opossums, the black fellow's food, and yet made a fuss if  their dogs killed a sheep for them sometimes, that he put his  rain-stone in a fire, and while he did that no rain would fall. He said  if all the sheep died the white fellows would go away again, and then,  as long ago, the black fellows' country would have plenty of emu and  kangaroo.    We saw a curious coincidence in connection with one of Bootha's  witch-poles in my garden, the pole whose falling foretold death of some  relative of some one in the house.    One afternoon there had been drizzling rain and a grey mist  overshadowing things. Matah went out to look at the chances of a  continuance of rain, the usual drought being on. He called to me to  come and see a curious sky. Looking towards the west I saw a golden  ball of a sun piercing the grey clouds which seemed like a spangled  veil over its face; shooting from the sun was a perfect halo of golden  light, from which three shafts spread into roadways up past the grey  clouds into the vault of heaven. The effect was very striking indeed,  against the grey clouds shaded from silver to almost black.    As we stood waiting for the sun to sink and the afterglow to paint  these clouds, as it did, from shrimp pink and heliotrope to vivid  crimson, we saw Bootha's pole fall. The air was quite still.    'The damp has loosened its setting,' said Matah, 'but we had better  leave it alone and let the old girl fix it up again herself; it may be  taboo to ordinary mortals like us.'    We left it.    That evening a messenger arrived from the sheep station to say my  cook's mother had died just before sunset. The camp were firm believers  in Bootha's witch-stick after that.    It was just as well we did not touch that stick; had we done so, Bootha  says we should have broken out in sores all over our bodies.    They say that long ago the wirreenuns always used to have a sort of  totem wizard-stick guarding the front of their camps.          CHAPTER VII    BIRTH--BETROTHAL--AN ABORIGINAL GIRL FROM INFANCY TO WOMANHOOD      To begin at the beginning, Bahloo, the moon, is a sort of patron of  women. He it is who creates the girl babies, assisted by Wahn, the  crow, sometimes.    Should Wahn attempt the business on his own account the result is  direful; women of his creating are always noisy and quarrelsome.    Bahloo's favourite spot for carrying on the girl manufacturing is  somewhere on the Culgoa. On one of the creeks there is to be seen, when  it is dry, a hole in the ground. As water runs along, the bed of this  creek, gradually a stone rises from this hole. As the water rises it  rises, always keeping its top out of the water.    This is the Goomarh, or spirit-stone, of Bahloo. No one would dare to  touch this stone where the baby girls' spirits are launched into space.    In the same neighbourhood is a clear water-hole, the rendezvous of the  snakes of Bahloo. Should a man go to drink there he sees no snakes, but  no sooner has he drunk some of the water than he sees hundreds; so even  water-drinkers see their snakes.    The name of the hole is Dahn.    Spirit-babies are usually despatched to Waddahgudjaelwon and sent by  her to hang promiscuously on trees, until some woman passes under where  they are, then they will seize a mother and be incarnated. This  resembles the Arunta belief, but with the Euahlayi the spirits are new  freshly created beings, not reincarnations of ancestral souls, as among  the Arunta. To live, a child must have an earthly father; that it has  not, is known by its being born with teeth.    Wurrawilberoo is said to snatch up a baby spirit sometimes and whirl  along towards some woman he wishes to discredit, and through the medium  of this woman he incarnates perhaps twins, or at least one baby. No  doubt were it not for signs of teeth in a spirit-baby of immaculate  conception, many a camp scandal would be conveniently nipped in the  bud.    Babies are sometimes sent directly to their mothers without the  Coolabah-tree or whirlwind medium.    The bronze mistletoe branches with their orange-red flowers are said to  be the disappointed babies whose wailing in vain for mothers has  wearied the spirits who transform them into these bunches, the red  flowers being formed from their baby blood. The spirits of babies and  children who die young are reincarnated, and should their first mother  have pleased them they choose her again and are called millanboo--the  same again.    They can instead, if they like, choose some other woman they know,  which seems very accommodating in those presiding over the  reincarnation department.    Sometimes two baby spirits will hang on one branch and incarnate  themselves in the same woman, who as result is the mother of twins, and  the object of much opprobrium in the camp. In fact, in the old days,  one of the twins would have been killed.    One of my Black-but-Comelys said, on hearing that a woman had twins:    'If it had been me I would have put my fingers round the throat of one  of them and killed it.' The woman who made this speech I had always  looked upon as the gentlest and kindliest of creatures.    The father of the twins has treated his"]]]
