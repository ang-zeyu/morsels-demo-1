In the Olympic and Sierra Nevada ranges  the most western outlier of this northern band of vegetation probably  contains the most inspiring forests of the world. There grow the  vigorous Oregon pines, firs, and spruces, and the still more famous Big  Trees or sequoias. High on the sides of the Sierra above the yuccas, the  live oaks, and the deciduous forest of the lower slopes, one meets these  Big Trees. To come upon them suddenly after a long, rough tramp over  the sunny lower slopes is the experience of a lifetime. Upward the great  trees rise sheer one hundred feet without a branch. The huge fluted  trunks encased in soft, red bark six inches or a foot thick are  more impressive than the columns of the grandest cathedral. It seems  irreverent to speak above a whisper. Each tree is a new wonder. One has  to walk around it and study it to appreciate its enormous size. Where a  tree chances to stand isolated so that one can see its full majesty, the  sense of awe is tempered by the feeling that in spite of their size the  trees have a beauty all their own. Lifted to such heights, the branches  appear to be covered with masses of peculiarly soft and rounded foliage  like the piled-up banks of a white cumulus cloud before a thunderstorm.  At the base of such a tree the eye is caught by the sharp, triangular  outline of one of its young progeny. The lower branches sweep the  ground. The foliage is harsh and rough. In almost no other species of  trees is there such a change from comparatively ungraceful youth to a  superbly beautiful old age.    The second great type of American forest is deciduous. The trees have  broad leaves quite unlike the slender needles or overlapping scales of  the northern evergreens. Each winter such forests shed their leaves.  Among the mountains where the frosts come suddenly, the blaze of glory  and brilliance of color which herald the shedding of the leaves are  surpassed in no other part of the world. Even the colors of the Painted  Desert in northern Arizona and the wonderful flowers of the California  plains are less pleasing. In the Painted Desert the patches of red,  yellow, gray-blue, white, pale green, and black have a garish, almost  repellent appearance. In California the flame-colored acres of poppies  in some places, of white or yellow daisylike flowers in others, or of  purple blossoms elsewhere have a softer expression than the bare soil  of the desert. Yet they lack the delicate blending and harmony of colors  which is the greatest charm of the autumn foliage in the deciduous  forests. Even where the forests consist of such trees as birches,  beeches, aspens, or sycamores, whose leaves merely turn yellow in the  fall, the contrast between this color and the green tint of summer or  the bare branches of winter adds a spice of variety which is lacking in  other and more monotonous forests.    From still other points of view the deciduous forest has an almost  unequaled degree of variety. In one place it consists of graceful little  birches whose white trunks shimmering in the twilight form just the  background for ghosts. Contrast them with the oak forest half a mile  away. There the sense of gracefulness gives place to a feeling of  strength. The lines are no longer vertical but horizontal. The knotted  elbows of the branches recall the keels of sturdy merchantmen of bygone  days. The acorns under foot suggest food for the herds of half-wild pigs  which roam among the trees in many a southern county. Of quite another  type are the stately forests of the Appalachians where splendid magnolia  and tulip trees spread their broad limbs aloft at heights of one hundred  feet or more.    Deciduous forests grow in the well-balanced regions where summer and  winter approach equality, where neither is unduly long, and where  neither is subject to prolonged drought. They extend southward from  central New England, the Great Lakes, and Minnesota, to Mississippi,  Arkansas, and eastern Texas. They predominate even in parts of such  prairie States as Michigan, Indiana, southern Illinois, and southeastern  Missouri. No part of the continent is more populous or more progressive  than the regions once covered by deciduous forests. In the United States  nearly sixty per cent of the inhabitants live in areas reclaimed from  such forests. Yet the area of the forests is less than a quarter of the  three million square miles that make up the United States.    In their relation to human life the forests of America differ far more  than do either grass-lands or deserts. In the far north, as we have  seen, the pine forests furnish one of the least favorable environments.  In middle latitudes the deciduous forests go to the opposite extreme  and furnish the most highly favored of the homes of man. Still farther  southward the increasing luxuriance of the forests, especially along  the Atlantic coast, renders them less and less favorable to mankind. In  southern Mexico and Yucatan the stately equatorial rain forest, the most  exuberant of all types of vegetation and the most unconquerable by man,  makes its appearance. It forms a discontinuous belt along the wet east  coast and on the lower slopes of the mountains from southern Yucatan to  Venezuela. Then it is interrupted by the grasslands of the Orinoco, but  revives again in still greater magnificence in the Guianas. Thence  it stretches not only along the coast but far into the little known  interior of the Great Amazon basin, while southward it borders all the  coast as far as southern Brazil. In the Amazon basin it reaches its  highest development and becomes the crowning glory of the vegetable  world, the most baffling obstacle to human progress.    Except in its evil effects on man, the equatorial rain forest is the  antithesis of the forests of the extreme north. The equatorial trees are  hardwood giants, broad leaved, bright flowered, and often fruit-bearing.  The northern trees are softwood dwarfs, needle-leaved, flowerless, and  cone-bearing. The equatorial trees are often branchless for one hundred  feet, but spread at the top into a broad overarching canopy which shuts  out the sun perpetually. The northern trees form sharp little pyramids  with low, widely spreading branches at the base and only short twigs at  the top. In the equatorial forests there is almost no underbrush. The  animals, such as monkeys, snakes, parrots, and brilliant insects, live  chiefly in the lofty treetops. In the northern forests there is almost  nothing except underbrush, and the foxes, rabbits, weasels, ptarmigans,  and mosquitoes live close to the ground in the shelter of the branches.  Both forests are alike, however, in being practically uninhabited by  man. Each is peopled only by primitive nomadic hunters who stand at the  very bottom in the scale of civilization.    Aside from the rain forest there are two other types in tropical  countries--jungle and scrub. The distinction between rain forest,  jungle, and scrub is due to the amount and the season of rainfall. An  understanding of this distinction not only explains many things in  the present condition of Latin America but also in the history of  pre-Columbian Central America. Forests, as we have seen, require that  the ground be moist throughout practically the whole of the season that  is warm enough for growth. Since the warm season lasts throughout the  year within the tropics, dense forests composed of uniformly large trees  corresponding to our oaks, maples, and beeches will not thrive unless  the ground is wet most of the time. Of course there may be no rain for a  few weeks, but there must be no long and regularly recurrent periods of  drought. Smaller trees and such species as the cocoanut palm are much  less exacting and will flourish even if there is a dry period of several  months. Still smaller, bushy species will thrive even when the rainfall  lasts only two or three months. Hence where the rainy season lasts most  of the year, rain forest prevails; where the rainy and dry seasons do  not differ greatly in length, tropical jungle is the dominant growth;  and where the rainy season is short and the dry season long, the jungle  degenerates into scrub or bush.    The relation of scrub, jungle, and rain forest is well illustrated in  Yucatan, where the ancient Mayas reared their stately temples. On the  northern coast the annual rainfall is only ten or fifteen inches and is  concentrated largely in our summer months. There the country is covered  with scrubby bushes six to ten feet high. These are beautifully green  during the rainy season from June to October, but later in the year  lose almost all their leaves. The landscape would be much like that of  a thick, bushy pasture in the United States at the same season, were  it not that in the late winter and early spring some of the bushes bear  brilliant red, yellow, or white flowers. As one goes inland from the  north coast of Yucatan the rainfall increases. The bushes become taller  and denser, trees twenty feet high become numerous, and many rise thirty  or forty feet or even higher. This is the jungle. Its smaller portions  suggest a second growth of timber in the deciduous forests of the United  States fifteen or twenty years after the cutting of the original forest,  but here there is much more evidence of rapid growth. A few species of  bushes and trees may remain green throughout the year, but during the  dry season most of the jungle plants lose their leaves, at least in  part.    With every mile that one advances into the more rainy interior, the  jungle becomes greener and fresher, the density of the lower growths  increases, and the proportion of large trees becomes greater until  finally jungle gives place to genuine forest. There many of the trees  remain green throughout the year. They rise to heights of fifty or sixty  feet even on the borders of their province, and at the top form a canopy  so thick that the ground "]]]
