Nine weeks after this, all but two days,  some glaziers were at work in the cathedral, and heard a faint noise  amongst the timbers which support the dome. Thinking it might be some  unfortunate human being, they tied a rope round a boy, and let him  down near the place whence the sound came. At the bottom he found a  dog lying on its side, the skeleton of another dog, and an old shoe  half eaten. The humanity of the boy led him to rescue the animal from  its miserable situation, and it was accordingly drawn up. Much  emaciated, and scarce able to stand, the workmen placed it in the  porch of the church, to die or live as it might happen. This was about  ten o'clock in the morning. Some time after, the dog was seen  endeavouring to cross the street at the top of Ludgate Hill; but its  weakness was so great, that, unsupported by a wall, it could not  accomplish it. The miserable appearance of the dog again excited the  compassion of a boy, who carried it over. By the aid of the houses it  was enabled to get to Fleet Market, and over two or three narrow  crossings in its way to Holborn Bridge, and about eight o'clock in the  evening it reached its master's house in Red Lion Street, Holborn, and  laid itself down on the steps, having been ten hours in its journey  from St. Paul's to that place. The dog was so much altered, its eyes  being so sunk in its head as to be scarce discernible, that the master  would not encourage his faithful old companion, who when lost was  supposed to weigh twenty pounds, but now only weighed three pounds  fourteen ounces. The first indication it gave of knowing its master  was by wagging its tail when he mentioned its name, Phillis; for a  long time it was unable to eat or drink, and it was kept alive by the  sustenance it received from its mistress, who used to feed it with a  teaspoon. At length it recovered. It must not be supposed that this  animal existed for nine weeks without food; she was in whelp when  lost, and doubtless ate her young. The remains of another dog, killed  by a similar fall, were likewise found, and were most probably  converted by the survivor to the most urgent of all natural purposes;  and when this treat was done, the shoe succeeded, which was almost  half devoured. What famine and a thousand accidents could not do, was  effected a short time after by the wheels of a coach, which  unfortunately went over her, and ended the life of poor Phillis.    Of dogs that have supported themselves in a wild state, to the great  loss and annoyance of the farmer, there are two instances worthy of  notice, from the cunning with which both these dogs frustrated, for a  length of time, every secret and open attack. In December, 1784, a dog  was left by a smuggling vessel near Boomer, on the coast of  Northumberland. Finding himself deserted, he began to worry sheep, and  did so much damage that he was the terror of the country, within the  circuit of above twenty miles. It is asserted, that when he caught a  sheep, he bit a hole in its right side, and after eating the fat about  the kidneys, left it. Several of them, thus lacerated, were found  alive by the shepherds; and being properly taken care of, some of them  recovered, and afterwards had lambs. From this delicacy of his  feeding, the destruction may in some measure be conceived, as the fat  of one sheep in a day would scarcely satisfy his hunger. Various were  the means used to destroy him: frequently was he pursued with hounds,  greyhounds, &c., but when the dogs came up with him, he laid down on  his back, as if supplicating for mercy, and in that position they  never hurt him; he therefore laid quietly, taking his rest, until the  hunters approached, when he made off without being followed by the  hounds, until they were again excited to the pursuit, which always  terminated unsuccessfully. He was one day pursued from Howick to  upwards of thirty miles' distance, but returned thither and killed  sheep the same evening. His constant residence was upon a rock on the  Heugh Hill, near Howick, where he had a view of four roads that  approached it; and there, in March 1785, after many fruitless  attempts, he was at last shot.    Another wild dog, which had committed similar devastation among the  sheep, near Wooler, in the same county (Northumberland), was, on the  6th of June, 1799, advertised to be hunted on the Wednesday following,  by three packs of hounds, which were to meet at different places; the  aid of men and fire-arms was also requested, with a reward promised of  twenty guineas to the person killing him. This dog was described by  those who had seen him at a distance as a large greyhound, with some  white in his face, neck and one fore-leg white, rather grey on the  back, and the rest of a jet-black. An immense concourse of people  assembled at the time appointed, but the chase was unprosperous; for  he eluded his pursuers among the Cheviot Hills, and, what is singular,  returned that same night to the place from whence he had been hunted  in the morning, and worried an ewe and her lamb. During the whole  summer he continued to destroy the sheep, but changed his quarters,  for he infested the fells, sixteen miles south of Carlisle, where  upwards of sixty sheep fell victims to his ferocity. In September,  hounds and firearms were again employed against him, and after a run  from Carrock Fell, which was computed to be thirty miles, he was shot  whilst the hounds were in pursuit by Mr. Sewel of Wedlock, who laid in  ambush at Moss Dale. During the chase, which occupied six hours, he  frequently turned upon the headmost hounds, and wounded several so  badly as to disable them. Upon examination, he appeared of the  Newfoundland breed, of a common size, wire-haired, and extremely lean.  This description does not tally with the dog so injurious to the  farmers in Northumberland, although, from circumstances, there is  little doubt but it was the same animal.    With a laughably philosophical account of dogs, under the supposition  of a transmigration of souls, and with their general natural history  from Linnaeus and Buffon, this introductory chapter will be concluded.    A facetious believer in the art of distinguishing at the sight of any  creature from what class of animals his soul is derived, thus allots  them:--    The souls of deceased bailiffs and common constables are in the  bodies of setting dogs and pointers; the terriers are inhabited by  trading justices; the bloodhounds were formerly a set of informers,  thief-takers, and false evidences; the spaniels were heretofore  courtiers, hangers-on of administrations, and hack journal-writers,  all of whom preserve their primitive qualities of fawning on their  feeders, licking their hands, and snarling and snapping at all who  offer to offend their master; a former train of gamblers and  black-legs are now embodied in that species of dog called lurchers;  bull-dogs and mastiffs were once butchers and drovers; greyhounds and  hounds owe their animation to country squires and foxhunters; little  whiffling, useless lap-dogs, draw their existence from the quondam  beau; macaronies, and gentlemen of the tippy, still being the  playthings of ladies, and used for their diversion. There are also a  set of sad dogs derived from attornies; and puppies, who were in past  time attornies' clerks, shopmen to retail haberdashers, men-milliners,  &c. &c. Turnspits are animated by old aldermen, who still enjoy the  smell of the roast meat; that droning, snarling species, styled Dutch  pugs, have been fellows of colleges; and that faithful, useful tribe  of shepherds' dogs, were, in days of yore, members of parliament, who  guarded the flock, and protected the sheep from wolves and thieves,  although indeed of late some have turned sheep-biters, and worried  those they ought to have defended.    Linnaeus informs us, the dog eats flesh, and farinaceous vegetables,  but not greens, (this is a mistake, for they will eat greens when  boiled); its stomach digests bones; it uses the tops of grass as a  vomit; is fond of rolling in carrion; voids its excrements on a stone;  its dung (the _album graecum_) is one of the greatest encouragers of  putrefaction; it laps up its drink with its tongue; makes water  side-ways, by lifting up one of its hind-legs; is most diuretic in the  company of a strange dog, and very apt to repeat it where another dog  has done the same: _Odorat anum alterius, menstruans catulit cum  variis; mordet illa illos; cohaeret copula junctus_. Its scent is most  exquisite when its nose is moist; it treads lightly on its toes;  scarce ever sweats, but when hot, lolls out its tongue; generally  walks frequently round the place it intends to lie down on; its sense  of hearing is very quick when asleep; it dreams. It goes with young  sixty-three days, and commonly brings from four to ten; the male  puppies resemble the dog, the female the bitch (an assertion by no  means accurate, any more than the tail always bending to the left is a  common character of the species). It is the most faithful of animals,  is very docile, fawns at his master's approach, runs before him on a  journey, often passing over the same ground; on coming to crossways,  stops and looks back; drives cattle home from the field; keeps herds  and flocks within bounds, protects them from wild beasts; points out  to the sportsman the game; brings the birds that are shot to its  master; will turn a spit; at Brussels, and in Holland, draws little  carts to the herb-market; in more northern regions, draws sledges with  provisions, travellers, &c.; will find out what is dropped; watchful  by night, and when the charge of a house or garden is at such times  committed to him, his boldness increases, and he sometimes becomes  perfectly ferocious; when it has been guilty of a theft, slinks away  with its tail between its legs; eats voraciously, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26556"],[0,"Myths and Marvels of Astronomy (#13)"],[1,"various estimates of the precessional period, 'from his  own or school knowledge, knew anything about such a phenomenon, until  Hipparchus, some 1900 years after the great pyramid's foundation, had a  glimpse of the fact; and yet it had been ruling the heavens for ages,  and was recorded in Jeezeh's ancient structure.' To minds not moved to  most energetic forgetfulness by the spirit of faith, it would appear  that when a square base had been decided upon, and its dimensions fixed,  with reference to the earth's diameter and the year, the diagonals of  the square base were determined also; and, if it so chanced that they  corresponded with some other perfectly independent relation, the fact  was not to be credited to the architects. Moreover it is manifest that  the closeness of such a coincidence suggests grave doubts how far other  coincidences can be relied upon as evidence of design. It seems, for  instance, altogether likely that the architects of the pyramid took the  sacred cubit equal to one 20,000,000th part of the earth's diameter for  their chief unit of length, and intentionally assigned to the side of  the pyramid's square base a length of just so many cubits as there are  days in the year; and the closeness of the coincidence between the  measured length and that indicated by this theory strengthens the idea  that this was the builder's purpose. But when we find that an even  closer coincidence immediately presents itself, which manifestly is a  coincidence _only_, the force of the evidence before derived from mere  coincidence is _pro tanto_ shaken. For consider what this new  coincidence really means. Its nature may be thus indicated: Take the  number of days in the year, multiply that number by 50, and increase the  result in the same degree that the diagonal of a square exceeds the  side--then the resulting number represents very approximately the number  of years in the great precessional period. The error, according to the  best modern estimates, is about one 575th part of the true period. This  is, of course, a merely accidental coincidence, for there is no  connection whatever in nature between the earth's period of rotation,  the shape of a square, and the earth's period of gyration. Yet this  merely accidental coincidence is very much closer than the other  supposed to be designed could be proved to be. It is clear, then, that  mere coincidence is a very unsafe evidence of design.    Of course the pyramidalists find a ready reply to such reasoning. They  argue that, in the first place, it may have been by express design that  the period of the earth's rotation was made to bear this particular  relation to the period of gyration in the mighty precessional movement:  which is much as though one should say that by express design the height  of Monte Rosa contains as many feet as there are miles in the 6000th  part of the sun's distance.[21] Then, they urge, the architects were  not bound to have a square base for the pyramid; they might have had an  oblong or a triangular base, and so forth--all which accords very ill  with the enthusiastic language in which the selection of a square base  had on other accounts been applauded.    Next let us consider the height of the pyramid. According to the best  modern measurements, it would seem that the height when (if ever) the  pyramid terminated above in a pointed apex, must have been about 486  feet. And from the comparison of the best estimates of the base side  with the best estimates of the height, it seems very likely indeed that  the intention of the builders was to make the height bear to the  perimeter of the base the same ratio which the radius of a circle bears  to the circumference. Remembering the range of difference in the base  measures it might be supposed that the exactness of the approximation to  this ratio could not be determined very satisfactorily. But as certain  casing stones have been discovered which indicate with considerable  exactness the slope of the original plane-surfaces of the pyramid, the  ratio of the height to the side of the base may be regarded as much more  satisfactorily determined than the actual value of either dimension. Of  course the pyramidalists claim a degree of precision indicating a most  accurate knowledge of the ratio between the diameter and the  circumference of a circle; and the angle of the only casing stone  measured being diversely estimated at 51 deg. 50' and 51 deg. 52-1/4',  they consider 50 deg. 51' 14.3\" the true value, and infer that the  builders regarded the ratio as 3.14159 to 1. The real fact is, that the  modern estimates of the dimensions of the casing stones (which, by the  way, ought to agree better if these stones are as well made as stated)  indicate the values 3.1439228 and 3.1396740 for the ratio; and all we  can say is, that the ratio really used lay _probably_ between these  limits, though it may have been outside either. Now the approximation of  either is not remarkably close. It requires no mathematical knowledge at  all to determine the circumference of a circle much more exactly. 'I  thought it very strange,' wrote a circle-squarer once to De Morgan  (_Budget of Paradoxes_, p. 389), 'that so many great scholars in all  ages should have failed in finding the true ratio, and have been  determined to try myself.' 'I have been informed,' proceeds De Morgan,  'that this trial makes the diameter to the circumference as 64 to 201,  giving the ratio equal to 3.1410625 exactly. The result was obtained by  the discoverer in three weeks after he first heard of the existence of  the difficulty. This quadrator has since published a little slip and  entered it at Stationers' Hall. He says he has done it by actual  measurement; and I hear from a private source that he uses a disc of  twelve inches diameter which he rolls upon a straight rail.' The  'rolling is a very creditable one; it is as much below the mark as  Archimedes was above it. Its performer is a joiner who evidently knows  well what he is about when he measures; he is not wrong by 1 in 3000.'  Such skilful mechanicians as the builders of the pyramid could have  obtained a closer approximation still by mere measurement. Besides, as  they were manifestly mathematicians, such an approximation as was  obtained by Archimedes must have been well within their power; and that  approximation lies well within the limits above indicated. Professor  Smyth remarks that the ratio was 'a quantity which men in general, and  all human science too, did not begin to trouble themselves about until  long, long ages, languages, and nations had passed away after the  building of the great pyramid; and after the sealing up, too, of that  grand primeval and prehistoric monument of the patriarchal age of the  earth according to Scripture.' I do not know where the Scripture records  the sealing up of the great pyramid; but it is all but certain that  during the very time when the pyramid was being built astronomical  observations were in progress which, for their interpretation, involved  of necessity a continual reference to the ratio in question. No one who  considers the wonderful accuracy with which, nearly two thousand years  before the Christian era, the Chaldaeans had determined the famous cycle  of the Saros, can doubt that they must have observed the heavenly bodies  for several centuries before they could have achieved such a success;  and the study of the motions of the celestial bodies compels 'men to  trouble themselves' about the famous ratio of the circumference to the  diameter.    We now come upon a new relation (contained in the dimensions of the  pyramid as thus determined) which, by a strange coincidence, causes the  height of the pyramid to appear to symbolise the distance of the sun.  There were 5813 pyramid inches, or 5819 British inches, in the height of  the pyramid according to the relations already indicated. Now, in the  sun's distance, according to an estimate recently adopted and freely  used,[22] there are 91,400,000 miles or 5791 thousand millions of  inches--that is, there are approximately as many thousand millions of  inches in the sun's distance as there are inches in the height of the  pyramid. If we take the relation as exact we should infer for the sun's  distance 5819 thousand millions of inches, or 91,840,000 miles--an  immense improvement on the estimate which for so many years occupied a  place of honour in our books of astronomy. Besides, there is strong  reason for believing that, when the results of recent observations are  worked out, the estimated sun distance will be much nearer this pyramid  value than even to the value 91,400,000 recently adopted. This result,  which one would have thought so damaging to faith in the evidence from  coincidence--nay, quite fatal after the other case in which a close  coincidence had appeared by merest accident--is regarded by the  pyramidalist as a perfect triumph for their faith.    They connect it with another coincidence, viz. that, assuming the height  determined in the way already indicated, then it so happens that the  height bears to half a diagonal of the base the ratio 9 to 10. Seeing  that the perimeter of the base symbolises the annual motion of the earth  round the sun, while the height represents the radius of a circle with  that perimeter, it follows that the height should symbolise the sun's  distance. 'That line, further,' says Professor Smyth (speaking on behalf  of Mr. W. Petrie, the discoverer of this relation), 'must represent'  this radius 'in the proportion of 1 to 1,000,000,000' (or _ten_ raised  to power _nine_), 'because amongst other reasons 10 to 9 is practically  the shape of the great pyramid.' For this building 'has such an angle at  the corners, that for every ten units its structure advances inwards on  the diagonal of the base, it practically rises upwards, or points to  sunshine' (_sic_) 'by _nine_.
