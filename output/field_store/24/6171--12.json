They find it made as follows:  Two logs six feet long and eight inches thick are laid parallel, but  seven inches apart at one end and only four at the other. They are  bedded firmly and flattened a little on the inside. On the upper sides  the logs are carefully hewed and leveled until pots, pans and kettles  will sit firmly and evenly on them. A strong forked stake is driven at  each end of the space, and a cross-pole, two or three inches thick, laid  on, for hanging kettles. This completes the range; simple, but  effective. (See illustration.) The broad end of the space is for  frying-pans, and the potato kettle. The narrow end, for coffee-pots and  utensils of lesser diameter. From six to eight dishes can be cooked at  the same time. Soups, stews, and beans are to be cooked in closely  covered kettles hung from the cross-pole, the bottoms of the kettles  reaching within some two inches of the logs. With a moderate fire they  may be left to simmer for hours without care or attention.    The fire is of the first importance. Start it with fine kindling and  clean, dry, hemlock bark. When you have a bright, even fire from end to  end of the space, keep it up with small fagots of the sweetest and most  wholesome woods in the forest. These are, in the order named, black  birch, hickory, sugar maple, yellow birch, and red beech. The sticks  should be short, and not over two inches across. Split wood is better  than round. The out-door range can be made by one man in little more  than an hour, and the camper-out, who once tries it, will never wish to  see a \"portable camp-stove\" again.    When the sun leaves the valley in the shade of Asaph Mountain, the boys  have a fragrant bed of elastic browse a foot deep in the shanty, with  pillows improvised from stuffed boot legs, cotton handkerchiefs, etc.  They cook their suppers on the range, and vote it perfect, no melting or  heating handles too hot for use, and no smoking of dishes, or faces.    [Illustration: OUT-DOOR COOKING-RANGE]    Just at dark--which means 9 P.M. in the last week of June--the fire is  carefully made and chinked. An hour later it is throwing its grateful  warmth and light directly into camp, and nowhere else. The camp turns  in. Not to wriggle and quarrel with obdurate stubs, but to sleep. And  sleep they do. The sound, deep, restful sleep of healthy young manhood,  inhaling pure mountain air on the healthiest bed yet known to man.    When it is past mid-night, and the fire burns low, and the chill night  breeze drifts into camp, they still do not rouse up, but only spoon  closer, and sleep right on. Only the O. W. turns out sleepily, at two  bells in the middle watch, after the manner of hunters, trappers, and  sailors, the world over. He quietly rebuilds the fire, reduces a bit of  navy plug to its lowest denomination, and takes a solitary smoke--still  holding down his favorite log. Quizzically and quietly he regards the  sleeping youngsters, and wonders if among them all there is one who will  do as he has done, i.e., relinquish all of what the world reckons as  success, for the love of nature and a free forest life. He hopes not.  And yet, as he glances at the calm yellow moon overhead, and listens to  the low murmur of the little waterfall below the spring, he has a faint  notion that it is not all loss and dross.    Knocking the ashes from his pipe he prepares to turn in, murmuring to  himself, half sadly, half humorously, \"I have been young, and now I am  old; yet have I never seen the true woodsman forsaken, or his seed  begging bread--or anything else, so to speak--unless it might be a  little tobacco or a nip of whisky.\" And he creeps into his blanket-bag,  backs softly out to the outside man, and joins the snorers.    [Sidenote: Getting Breakfast]    It is broad daylight when he again turns out, leaving the rest still  sleeping soundly. He starts a lively fire in the range, treats two  coffee pots to a double handful of coffee and three pints of water each,  sets on the potato kettle, washes the potatoes, then sticks his head  into the camp, and rouses the party with a regular second mate's hail.  \"Star-a-ar-bo'lin's aho-o-o-y. Turn out, you beggars. Come on deck and  see it rain.\" And the boys do turn out. Not with wakeful alacrity, but  in a dazed, dreamy, sleepy way. They open wide eyes, when they see that  the sun is turning the sombre tops of pines and hemlocks to a soft  orange yellow.    \"I'd have sworn,\" says one, \"that I hadn't slept over fifteen minutes by  the watch.\"    \"And I,\" says another, \"was just watching the fire, when I dropped off  in a doze. In about five minutes I opened my eyes, and I'll be shot if  it wasn't sunrise.\"    \"As for me,\" says a third, \"I don't know as I've slept at all. I  remember seeing somebody poking the fire last night. Next thing I knew,  some lunatic was yelling around camp about 'starbolin's,' and 'turning  out.' Guess I'll lay down and have my nap out.\"    \"Yes,\" says the O. W., \"I would. If I was a healthy youngster, and  couldn't get along with seven hours and a half of solid sleep, I'd take  the next forenoon for it. Just at present, I want to remark that I've  got the coffee and potato business underway, and I'll attend to them. If  you want anything else for breakfast, you'll have to cook it.\"    And the boys, rising to the occasion, go about the breakfast with  willing hands. It is noticeable, however, that only one pan of trout is  cooked, two of the youngsters preferring to fall back on broiled ham,  remarking that brook trout is too rich and cloying for a steady diet.  Which is true. The appetite for trout has very sensibly subsided, and  the boyish eagerness for trout fishing has fallen off immensely. Only  two of the party show any interest in the riffles. They stroll down  stream leisurely, to try their flies for an hour or two. The others  elect to amuse themselves about the camp, cutting small timber with  their little hatchets, picking fresh browse, or skirmishing the mountain  side for wintergreen berries and sassafras. The fishermen return in a  couple of hours, with a score of fair-sized trout. They remark  apologetically that it is blazing hot--and there are plenty of trout  ahead. Then they lean their rods against the shanty, and lounge on the  blankets, and smoke and dose.    It is less than forty-eight hours since the cross-pole was laid; and,  using a little common sense woodcraft, the camp has already attained to  a systematic no-system of rest, freedom and idleness. Every man is free  to \"loaf, and invite his soul.\" There is good trouting within an hour's  walk for those who choose, and there is some interest, with a little  exercise, in cooking and cutting night wood, slicking up, etc. But the  whole party is stricken with \"camp-fever,\" \"Indian laziness,\" the _dolce  far niente_. It is over and around every man, enveloping him as with a  roseate blanket from the Castle of Indolence.    It is the perfect summer camp.    And it is no myth; but a literal resume of a five days' outing at Poplar  Spring, on Marsh Creek, in Pennsylvania. Alas, for the beautiful valley,  that once afforded the finest camping grounds I have ever known.        Never any more          Can it be          Unto me (or anybody else)      As before.    A huge tannery, six miles above Poplar Spring, poisons and blackens the  stream with chemicals, bark and ooze. The land has been brought into  market, and every acre eagerly bought up by actual settlers. The once  fine covers and thickets are converted into fields thickly dotted with  blackened stumps. And, to crown the desolation, heavy laden trains of  \"The Pine Creek and Jersey Shore R. R.\" go thundering almost hourly over  the very spot where stood our camp by Poplar Spring.    [Sidenote: Progress?]    Of course, this is progress; but, whether backward or forward, had  better be decided sixty years hence. And, just what has happened to the  obscure valley of Marsh Creek, is happening today, on a larger scale,  all over the land. It is the same old story of grab and greed. Let us go  on the \"make\" today, and \"whack up\" tomorrow; cheating each other as  villainously as we may, and posterity be d--d. \"What's all the w-u-u-rld  to a man when his wife is a widdy?\"    This is the moral: From Maine to Montana; from the Adirondacks to  Alaska; from the Yosemite to the Yellowstone, the trout-hog, the  deer-wolf, the netter, the skin-hunter, each and all have it their own  way; and the law is a farce--only to be enforced where the game has  vanished forever. Perhaps the man-child is born who will live to write  the moral of all this--when it is too late.          Chapter VII         MORE HINTS ON COOKING, WITH SOME SIMPLE RECEIPTS--BREAD,       COFFEE, POTATOES, SOUPS, STEWS, BEANS, FISH, MEAT, VENISON          We may live without friends, we may live without books,      But civilized man cannot live without cooks.      It is probably true that nothing connected with out-door life in camp is  so badly botched as the cooking. It is not through any lack of the raw  material, which may be had of excellent quality in any country village.  It is not from lack of intelligence or education, for the men you meet  in the woods, as outers or sportsmen, are rather over than under the  average in these respects. Perhaps it is because it has been dinned into  our ears from early childhood, that an appetite, a healthy longing for  something good to eat, a tickling of the palate with wholesome,  appetizing food, is beneath the attention of an aesthetic, intellectual  man. Forgetting that the entire man, mental and physical, depends on  proper aliment and the healthy assimilation thereof; and that a thin,  dyspeptic man can no more keep up in the struggle of life, than the  lightning "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34617"],[0,"The Jews of Barnow: Stories (#13)"],[1,"imagination. Adam Mickiewicz is nothing to you.\"    \"What! what!--ho, ho! you do not believe me! My dear Herr von Negrusz, I  do not deserve this. Have you ever heard me tell a lie? And besides  that, what good would it do me? No; on my honor, I am speaking the  truth. I was quite sorry for the poor woman. She is over head and ears  in love with you. I never saw anything like it--even I, who know women  so well. Over head and ears, over head and ears; and now I want to know  what I am to say to her? Nathan is away--do you understand?--away for  three weeks--ho, ho! The woman....\"    \"Herr von Bolwinski,\" interrupted the district judge, rising and folding  up the newspapers, which he had been glancing through, \"you, who are a  Catholic nobleman, think you may say what you like of the wife of the  Jew Silberstein behind her back. I must, however, tell you that if I did  not know that the story you have just told me is a lie from the first  word to the last....\"    \"Herr von Negrusz!...\"    \"I repeat it--a lie from the first word to the last. Had you really been  the bearer of a message of love to me from a faithless woman, I should  have declined any further acquaintance with you. You have been joking in  your peculiar way, which is certainly not my way, for I object to jokes  at the expense of such worthy people as this Jewish couple. I recommend  you not to continue such jokes when you find any of your butts as  reluctant as I....\"    Herr Florian lost his temper completely. His story was not credited,  and his good joke was lost. This he might have pardoned, as he was  accustomed to the incredulity of his hearers, but Herr von Negrusz took  his story seriously, almost tragically. He treated him like a schoolboy,  and that he could not stand. He felt that his honor would not allow him  to retract his words, so he rose, and with much gesticulation, said in  an overbearing way--    \"Do you know to whom you are speaking--do you hear? Do you know to whom  you are speaking, I ask? You are speaking to me, Florian von Bolwinski.  You must respect what I say; remember what is due to me. I never heard  such language. A liar and a go-between, am I?... ho, ho! I must be  respected. Remain virtuous if you choose, but what I tell you is true.  Chane is in love with you--madly in love....\"    \"Be silent!\"    These words, spoken in a sharp incisive voice, interrupted his flow of  words. He looked toward the door, and his arms fell to his sides, the  blood forsaking his cheeks. Herr von Negrusz turned crimson.    \"Be silent,\" repeated Chane, stretching her hand toward the fat,  trembling little man. Drawn up to her full height, she stood in the  doorway, looking as proud and beautiful as a queen.    Herr Florian let his head sink and his under lip fall, and altogether  looked very sheepish. Chane closed the door, and walked up to the two  men.    \"Did--you--listen?\" stammered the old sinner, trying to laugh.    \"I did not listen,\" answered Chane, emphatically. \"It is not my custom  to try to hear what gentlemen say in this room. It is no concern of  mine. I was engaged in that part of the shop where the spices are; it is  so close to the door that I could not help overhearing. It was bitter  enough to do so, but it is harder still to be obliged to speak for  myself.\" As she said this the hot blood rushed to her face. She  hesitated, and then continued: \"But Nathan is not at home, and I am  compelled to tell you myself, to your face, Herr von Bolwinski, that you  are a liar. Yesterday I did ask my husband if Herr von Negrusz was  proud, as he never spoke to me, as other gentlemen do. I meant nothing  wrong, and therefore, Herr von Bolwinski ... you ... you ought to be  ashamed....\"    Herr von Bolwinski did as he was bid; he was ashamed. His face fell, and  his eyes sought the ground. Herr von Negrusz, on the contrary, fixed his  eyes upon Chane. It was dangerous, even for one whose heart was \"buried  in the grave,\" to drink in her marvelous beauty.    \"I thank Herr von Negrusz,\" continued Chane, with increasing hesitation,  and blushing more deeply than before, \"for showing a friendly interest  in Nathan and me; and if he will not speak to me, I must speak to him,  and tell him that he is rightly called a noble-minded man, and for my  part, I thank him....\"    Like Herr Florian, the district judge found no words of reply, and  looked down somewhat abashed. He seized his hat, and bowing  respectfully, left the room.    His old housekeeper, who had a great regard for him, was distressed at  his loss of appetite that evening, for he sent away his favorite dishes  almost untouched.           *       *       *       *       *    The days passed, and imperceptibly a bond of love was formed between  these two hearts, which was sinful and criminal in the sight of God and  man.    The scene in the little wine-shop had had no apparent consequences,  except that Herr von Bolwinski took the rest of his potations at home  that day. Of course he took an extra quantity, to console him for what  he considered his undeserved rebuff. Next day he appeared as usual,  passing Chane in the shop.    Herr von Negrusz also came as usual in the middle of the day. That he  should do so was not a matter of surprise. It was, however, astonishing  that things went on in the old way. Bolwinski continued his customary  badinage, and getting no reply from Chane, he said, \"Ho, ho! you are  proud, but I love you all the same!\" while Herr von Negrusz only bowed  as before.    What was his reason?    It is not difficult for people to deceive themselves when they wish to  do so. \"I will not speak to her,\" he said to himself, \"lest I should  give the old gossip an opportunity for sarcasm, or the invention of  fresh slanders.\" At the same time he was conscious that this was not his  real reason, and sometimes he was childish enough to be angry with the  woman whose beauty tempted his heart to be untrue to its natural sense  of honor.    It was not the bashfulness of which the lively Emilie accused him;  because, after she had on one occasion pressed his hand confidentially,  he had not offered to shake hands with her again. Neither was it that  \"unsusceptibility to the charms of women\" of which the three graces  complained. No sensible, clever man is ever bashful, and what did his  unsusceptibility amount to? Alas! the beautiful and outraged woman had  made a deeper impression on his heart than was altogether pleasant to  him. The wanton conduct of Herr von Bolwinski had placed him in such a  peculiar position toward a woman with whom he was unacquainted, that he  could not hit upon the right tone or words with which to address her. He  certainly did not feel at ease in her presence, although he swore to  himself that he was so. He continually said to himself, \"I will not  speak to her, so that that wicked old woman in trousers may have no  reason for chatter; besides, I have nothing to talk to her about.\" He  knew that he was deceiving himself, and that he was behaving badly; but  as time passed on, he found it more and more impossible to break the  silence which he knew to be a mistake. He longed to know what she  thought of him.    And Chane never spoke of him, even to her husband. She had talked about  him openly before the scene in the wine-room, and now she could do so no  longer. She did not even tell Nathan, on his return home after a month's  absence, of the gross conduct of Herr von Bolwinski. \"Why should I make  him angry?\" she thought; but she knew that she was unwilling to mention  the name of Herr von Negrusz. An inexplicable reticence prevented her  from doing so. She thought so much about him, and yet she could not  speak of him. Every day her imagination took a different turn. Sometimes  she thought it was not nice of him to treat her with such marked  indifference; and at other times she wondered if the haughty Christian  really believed she was in love with him, and wished to show her that  she was nothing to him. \"He need not do that,\" she thought, \"for he is  certainly nothing to me. But then he stood up for me nobly, and perhaps  he does not intend to give that fat, ugly Bolwinski an opportunity for  further lies. It must be true that his heart is buried in the grave. He  loves a dead woman so truly that he will never speak to a living one.  He does not even talk to the custom-house officer's wife. How is it  possible to love one who is dead--and what is love?...\"    The Power that shapes our lives often uses strange means. Two people  were being brought together who were not on speaking terms!    They maintained silence for three long months, though they saw one  another daily. The summer passed away, the yellow leaves in the  monastery garden began to fall; the vintage came, and Nathan started on  his long rounds through Hungary and Moldavia. He was to return on the  Sabbath before the great feast. \"Take care of yourself, and see that you  get good vinegar out of the spoiled must,\" were his parting words. He  embraced his wife, calmly kissing her on the brow. He little thought  that he did so for the last time.           *       *       *       *       *    One beautiful sunny day in September Chane was busy in the shop, and  Herr von Bolwinski and the collector of taxes were talking politics in  the _casino_. Everything was as usual. Herr von Negrusz stepped into the  shop. He lifted his hat, and was passing on, but was prevented by a cask  of herrings, which filled the passage.    \"You must come round here,\" said Chane, pointing behind the counter.    \"Thank you,\" he said, passing her. Then he stopped, and added, \"You are  making changes here.\" He wished to say something, and could think of  nothing better.    \"Yes; for the fruit season.\"    \"There is a splendid crop this year....\"    \"Particularly of apples....\"    \"And the wine promises well, I hear. Where is Herr Nathan just now?\"    \"At Hegyallja, I believe; but I do not"]]]
