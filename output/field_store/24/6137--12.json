[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261"],[0,"News from Nowhere; Or, An Epoch of Rest (#13)"],[1," remember about  that strange piece of baseless folly, the result, like all other follies  of the period, of the hideous class tyranny which then obtained.  What do  we think of it now? you would say.  My friend, that is a question easy to  answer.  How could it possibly be but that maternity should be highly  honoured amongst us?  Surely it is a matter of course that the natural  and necessary pains which the mother must go through form a bond of union  between man and woman, an extra stimulus to love and affection between  them, and that this is universally recognised.  For the rest, remember  that all the _artificial_ burdens of motherhood are now done away with.  A  mother has no longer any mere sordid anxieties for the future of her  children.  They may indeed turn out better or worse; they may disappoint  her highest hopes; such anxieties as these are a part of the mingled  pleasure and pain which goes to make up the life of mankind.  But at  least she is spared the fear (it was most commonly the certainty) that  artificial disabilities would make her children something less than men  and women: she knows that they will live and act according to the measure  of their own faculties.  In times past, it is clear that the 'Society' of  the day helped its Judaic god, and the 'Man of Science' of the time, in  visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children.  How to reverse this  process, how to take the sting out of heredity, has for long been one of  the most constant cares of the thoughtful men amongst us.  So that, you  see, the ordinarily healthy woman (and almost all our women are both  healthy and at least comely), respected as a child-bearer and rearer of  children, desired as a woman, loved as a companion, unanxious for the  future of her children, has far more instinct for maternity than the poor  drudge and mother of drudges of past days could ever have had; or than  her sister of the upper classes, brought up in affected ignorance of  natural facts, reared in an atmosphere of mingled prudery and prurience.\"    \"You speak warmly,\" I said, \"but I can see that you are right.\"    \"Yes,\" he said, \"and I will point out to you a token of all the benefits  which we have gained by our freedom.  What did you think of the looks of  the people whom you have come across to-day?\"    Said I: \"I could hardly have believed that there could be so many good-  looking people in any civilised country.\"    He crowed a little, like the old bird he was.  \"What! are we still  civilised?\" said he.  \"Well, as to our looks, the English and Jutish  blood, which on the whole is predominant here, used not to produce much  beauty.  But I think we have improved it.  I know a man who has a large  collection of portraits printed from photographs of the nineteenth  century, and going over those and comparing them with the everyday faces  in these times, puts the improvement in our good looks beyond a doubt.  Now, there are some people who think it not too fantastic to connect this  increase of beauty directly with our freedom and good sense in the  matters we have been speaking of: they believe that a child born from the  natural and healthy love between a man and a woman, even if that be  transient, is likely to turn out better in all ways, and especially in  bodily beauty, than the birth of the respectable commercial marriage bed,  or of the dull despair of the drudge of that system.  They say, Pleasure  begets pleasure.  What do you think?\"    \"I am much of that mind,\" said I.          CHAPTER X: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS      \"Well,\" said the old man, shifting in his chair, \"you must get on with  your questions, Guest; I have been some time answering this first one.\"    Said I: \"I want an extra word or two about your ideas of education;  although I gathered from Dick that you let your children run wild and  didn't teach them anything; and in short, that you have so refined your  education, that now you have none.\"    \"Then you gathered left-handed,\" quoth he.  \"But of course I understand  your point of view about education, which is that of times past, when  'the struggle for life,' as men used to phrase it (_i.e._, the struggle  for a slave's rations on one side, and for a bouncing share of the slave-  holders' privilege on the other), pinched 'education' for most people  into a niggardly dole of not very accurate information; something to be  swallowed by the beginner in the art of living whether he liked it or  not, and was hungry for it or not: and which had been chewed and digested  over and over again by people who didn't care about it in order to serve  it out to other people who didn't care about it.\"    I stopped the old man's rising wrath by a laugh, and said: \"Well, _you_  were not taught that way, at any rate, so you may let your anger run off  you a little.\"    \"True, true,\" said he, smiling.  \"I thank you for correcting my  ill-temper: I always fancy myself as living in any period of which we may  be speaking.  But, however, to put it in a cooler way: you expected to  see children thrust into schools when they had reached an age  conventionally supposed to be the due age, whatever their varying  faculties and dispositions might be, and when there, with like disregard  to facts to be subjected to a certain conventional course of 'learning.'  My friend, can't you see that such a proceeding means ignoring the fact  of _growth_, bodily and mental?  No one could come out of such a mill  uninjured; and those only would avoid being crushed by it who would have  the spirit of rebellion strong in them.  Fortunately most children have  had that at all times, or I do not know that we should ever have reached  our present position.  Now you see what it all comes to.  In the old  times all this was the result of _poverty_.  In the nineteenth century,  society was so miserably poor, owing to the systematised robbery on which  it was founded, that real education was impossible for anybody.  The  whole theory of their so-called education was that it was necessary to  shove a little information into a child, even if it were by means of  torture, and accompanied by twaddle which it was well known was of no  use, or else he would lack information lifelong: the hurry of poverty  forbade anything else.  All that is past; we are no longer hurried, and  the information lies ready to each one's hand when his own inclinations  impel him to seek it.  In this as in other matters we have become  wealthy: we can afford to give ourselves time to grow.\"    \"Yes,\" said I, \"but suppose the child, youth, man, never wants the  information, never grows in the direction you might hope him to do:  suppose, for instance, he objects to learning arithmetic or mathematics;  you can't force him when he _is_ grown; can't you force him while he is  growing, and oughtn't you to do so?\"    \"Well,\" said he, \"were you forced to learn arithmetic and mathematics?\"    \"A little,\" said I.    \"And how old are you now?\"    \"Say fifty-six,\" said I.    \"And how much arithmetic and mathematics do you know now?\" quoth the old  man, smiling rather mockingly.    Said I: \"None whatever, I am sorry to say.\"    Hammond laughed quietly, but made no other comment on my admission, and I  dropped the subject of education, perceiving him to be hopeless on that  side.    I thought a little, and said: \"You were speaking just now of households:  that sounded to me a little like the customs of past times; I should have  thought you would have lived more in public.\"    \"Phalangsteries, eh?\" said he.  \"Well, we live as we like, and we like to  live as a rule with certain house-mates that we have got used to.  Remember, again, that poverty is extinct, and that the Fourierist  phalangsteries and all their kind, as was but natural at the time,  implied nothing but a refuge from mere destitution.  Such a way of life  as that, could only have been conceived of by people surrounded by the  worst form of poverty.  But you must understand therewith, that though  separate households are the rule amongst us, and though they differ in  their habits more or less, yet no door is shut to any good-tempered  person who is content to live as the other house-mates do: only of course  it would be unreasonable for one man to drop into a household and bid the  folk of it to alter their habits to please him, since he can go elsewhere  and live as he pleases.  However, I need not say much about all this, as  you are going up the river with Dick, and will find out for yourself by  experience how these matters are managed.\"    After a pause, I said: \"Your big towns, now; how about them?  London,  which--which I have read about as the modern Babylon of civilization,  seems to have disappeared.\"    \"Well, well,\" said old Hammond, \"perhaps after all it is more like  ancient Babylon now than the 'modern Babylon' of the nineteenth century  was.  But let that pass.  After all, there is a good deal of population  in places between here and Hammersmith; nor have you seen the most  populous part of the town yet.\"    \"Tell me, then,\" said I, \"how is it towards the east?\"    Said he: \"Time was when if you mounted a good horse and rode straight  away from my door here at a round trot for an hour and a half; you would  still be in the thick of London, and the greater part of that would be  'slums,' as they were called; that is to say, places of torture for  innocent men and women; or worse, stews for rearing and breeding men and  women in such degradation that that torture should seem to them mere  ordinary and natural life.\"    \"I know, I know,\" I said, rather impatiently.  \"That was what was; tell  me something of what is.  Is any of that left?\"    \"Not an inch,\" said he; \"but some memory of it abides with us, and I am  glad of it.  Once a year, on May-day, we hold a solemn feast in those  easterly communes of London to commemorate The Clearing of Misery, as it  is called.  On that day we have music and dancing, and merry"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32664"],[0,"Black Amazon of Mars (#13)"],[1,"slowed their forward rush. They stopped and waited,  well back from the cairn.    Stark reached the edge of tumbled rock. He felt the first warm flare of  the force-waves in his blood, and slowly the chill began to creep out  from his bones. He climbed, scrambling upward over the rough stones of  the cairn.    Abruptly, then, at Ban Cruach's feet, he slipped and fell. For a second  it seemed that he could not move.    His back was turned toward the ice-folk. His body was bent forward, and  shielded so, his hands worked with feverish speed.    From his cloak he tore a strip of cloth. From the iron boss he took the  glittering lens, the talisman of Ban Cruach. Stark laid the lens against  his brow, and bound it on.    _The remembered shock, the flood and sweep of memories that were not his  own. The mind of Ban Cruach thundering its warning, its hard-won  knowledge of an ancient, epic war...._    He opened his own mind wide to receive those memories. Before he had  fought against them. Now he knew that they were his one small chance in  this swift gamble with death. Two things only of his own he kept firm in  that staggering tide of another man's memories. Two names--Ciara and  Balin.    He rose up again. And now his face had a strange look, a curious  duality. The features had not changed, but somehow the lines of the  flesh had altered subtly, so that it was almost as though the old  unconquerable king himself had risen again in battle.    He mounted the last step or two and stood before Ban Cruach. A shudder  ran through him, a sort of gathering and settling of the flesh, as  though Stark's being had accepted the stranger within it. His eyes, cold  and pale as the very ice that sheathed the valley, burned with a cruel  light.    He reached and took the sword, out of the frozen hands of Ban Cruach.    As though it were his own, he knew the secret of the metal rings that  bound its hilt, below the ball of crystal. The savage throb of the  invisible radiation beat in his quickening flesh. He was warm again, his  blood running swiftly, his muscles sure and strong. He touched the rings  and turned them.    The fan-shaped aura of force that had closed the Gates of Death narrowed  in, and as it narrowed it leaped up from the blade of the sword in a  tongue of pale fire, faintly shimmering, made visible now by the full  focus of its strength.    Stark felt the wave of horror bursting from the minds of the ice-folk as  they perceived what he had done. And he laughed.    His bitter laughter rang harsh across the valley as he turned to face  them, and he heard in his brain the shuddering, silent shriek that went  up from all that gathered company....    \"_Ban Cruach! Ban Cruach has returned!_\"    They had touched his mind. They knew.           *       *       *       *       *    He laughed again, and swept the sword in a flashing arc, and watched the  long bright blade of force strike out more terrible than steel, against  the rainbow bodies of the shining ones.    They fell. Like flowers under a scythe they fell, and all across the ice  the ones who were yet untouched turned about in their hundreds and fled  back toward the tower.    Stark came leaping down the cairn, the talisman of Ban Cruach bound upon  his brow, the sword of Ban Cruach blazing in his hand.    He swung that awful blade as he ran. The force-beam that sprang from it  cut through the press of creatures fleeing before him, hampered by their  own numbers as they crowded back through the archway.    He had only a few short seconds to do what he had to do.    Rushing with great strides across the ice, spurning the withered bodies  of the dead.... And then, from the glooming darkness that hovered around  the tower of stone, the black cold beam struck down.    Like a coiling whip it lashed him. The deadly numbness invaded the cells  of his flesh, ached in the marrow of his bones. The bright force of the  sword battled the chill invaders, and a corrosive agony tore at Stark's  inner body where the antipathetic radiations waged war.    His steps faltered. He gave one hoarse cry of pain, and then his limbs  failed and he went heavily to his knees.    Instinct only made him cling to the sword. Waves of blinding anguish  racked him. The coiling lash of darkness encircled him, and its touch  was the abysmal cold of outer space, striking deep into his heart.    _Hold the sword close, hold it closer, like a shield. The pain is great,  but I will not die unless I drop the sword._    Ban Cruach the mighty had fought this fight before.    Stark raised the sword again, close against his body. The fierce pulse  of its brightness drove back the cold. Not far, for the freezing touch  was very strong. But far enough so that he could rise again and stagger  on.    The dark force of the tower writhed and licked about him. He could not  escape it. He slashed it in a blind fury with the blazing sword, and  where the forces met a flicker of lightning leaped in the air, but it  would not be beaten back.    He screamed at it, a raging cat-cry that was all Stark, all primitive  fury at the necessity of pain. And he forced himself to run, to drag his  tortured body faster across the ice. _Because Ciara is dying, because  the dark cold wants me to stop...._    The ice-folk jammed and surged against the archway, in a panic hurry to  take refuge far below in their many-levelled city. He raged at them,  too. They were part of the cold, part of the pain. Because of them Ciara  and Balin were dying. He sent the blade of force lancing among them, his  hatred rising full tide to join the hatred of Ban Cruach that lodged in  his mind.    Stab and cut and slash with the long terrible beam of brightness. They  fell and fell, the hideous shining folk, and Stark sent the light of Ban  Cruach's weapon sweeping through the tower itself, through the openings  that were like windows in the stone.    Again and again, stabbing through those open slits as he ran. And  suddenly the dark beam of force ceased to move. He tore out of it, and  it did not follow him, remaining stationary as though fastened to the  ice.    The battle of forces left his flesh. The pain was gone. He sped on to  the tower.    He was close now. The withered bodies lay in heaps before the arch. The  last of the ice-folk had forced their way inside. Holding the sword  level like a lance, Stark leaped in through the arch, into the tower.           *       *       *       *       *    The shining ones were dead where the destroying warmth had touched  them. The flying spiral ribbons of ice were swept clean of them, the  arching bridges and the galleries of that upper part of the tower.    They were dead along the ledge, under the control bank. They were dead  across the mechanism that spun the frosty doom around Ciara and Balin.  The whirling disc still hummed.    Below, in that stupendous well, the crowding ice-folk made a seething  pattern of color on the narrow ways. But Stark turned his back on them  and ran along the ledge, and in him was the heavy knowledge that he had  come too late.    The frost had thickened around Ciara and Balin. It encrusted them like  stiffened lace, and now their flesh was overlaid with a diamond shell of  ice.    Surely they could not live!    He raised the sword to smite down at the whirring disc, to smash it, but  there was no need. When the full force of that concentrated beam struck  it, meeting the focus of shadow that it held, there was a violent flare  of light and a shattering of crystal. The mechanism was silent.    The glooming veil was gone from around the ice-shelled man and woman.  Stark forgot the creatures in the shaft below him. He turned the blazing  sword full upon Ciara and Balin.    It would not affect the thin covering of ice. If the woman and the man  were dead, it would not affect their flesh, any more than it had Ban  Cruach's. But if they lived, if there was still a spark, a flicker  beneath that frozen mail, the radiation would touch their blood with  warmth, start again the pulse of life in their bodies.    He waited, watching Ciara's face. It was still as marble, and as white.    Something--instinct, or the warning mind of Ban Cruach that had learned  a million years ago to beware the creatures of the ice--made him glance  behind him.    Stealthy, swift and silent, up the winding ways they came. They had  guessed that he had forgotten them in his anxiety. The sword was turned  away from them now, and if they could take him from behind, stun him  with the chill force of the sceptre-like rods they carried....    He slashed them with the sword. He saw the flickering beam go down and  down the shaft, saw the bodies fall like drops of rain, rebounding here  and there from the flying spans and carrying the living with them.    He thought of the many levels of the city. He thought of all the  countless thousands that must inhabit them. He could hold them off in  the shaft as long as he wished if he had no other need for the sword.  But he knew that as soon as he turned his back they would be upon him  again, and if he should once fall....    He could not spare a moment, or a chance.    He looked at Ciara, not knowing what to do, and it seemed to him that  the sheathing frost had melted, just a little, around her face.    Desperately, he struck down again at the creatures in the shaft, and  then the answer came to him.    He dropped the sword. The squat, round mechanism was beside him, with  its broken crystal wheel. He picked it up.    It was heavy. It would have been heavy for two men to lift, but Stark  was a driven man. Grunting, swaying with the effort, he lifted it and  let it fall, out and down.    Like a thunderbolt it struck among those slender bridges, the spiderweb  of icy strands that spanned the shaft. Stark watched it go, and listened  to the brittle snapping of the ice, the final crashing of a million  shards at the bottom far below.    He smiled, and turned"]]]
