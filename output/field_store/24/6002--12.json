In old days Harold was always  within hail, and companionship of equal age and understanding was  available.  But now his very reticence in her own interest, and by her  father's wishes, made for her pain.  Harold had put his strongest  restraint on himself, and in his own way suffered a sort of silent  martyrdom.  He loved Stephen with every fibre of his being.  Day by day  he came toward her with eager step; day by day he left her with a pang  that made his heart ache and seemed to turn the brightness of the day to  gloom.  Night by night he tossed for hours thinking, thinking, wondering  if the time would ever come when her kisses would be his . . . But the  tortures and terrors of the night had their effect on his days.  It  seemed as if the mere act of thinking, of longing, gave him ever renewed  self-control, so that he was able in his bearing to carry out the task he  had undertaken: to give Stephen time to choose a mate for herself.  Herein  lay his weakness--a weakness coming from his want of knowledge of the  world of women.  Had he ever had a love affair, be it never so mild a  one, he would have known that love requires a positive expression.  It is  not sufficient to sigh, and wish, and hope, and long, all to oneself.  Stephen felt instinctively that his guarded speech and manner were due to  the coldness--or rather the trusting abated worship--of the brotherhood  to which she had been always accustomed.  At the time when new forces  were manifesting and expanding themselves within her; when her growing  instincts, cultivated by the senses and the passions of young nature,  made her aware of other forces, new and old, expanding themselves outside  her; at the time when the heart of a girl is eager for new impressions  and new expansions, and the calls of sex are working within her all  unconsciously, Harold, to whom her heart would probably have been the  first to turn, made himself in his effort to best show his love, a  _quantite negligeable_.    Thus Stephen, whilst feeling that the vague desires of budding womanhood  were trembling within her, had neither thought nor knowledge of their  character or their ultimate tendency.  She would have been shocked,  horrified, had that logical process, which she applied so freely to less  personal matters, been used upon her own intimate nature.  In her case  logic would of course act within a certain range; and as logic is a  conscious intellectual process, she became aware that her objective was  man.  Man--in the abstract.  'Man,' not 'a man.'  Beyond that, she could  not go.  It is not too much to say that she did not ever, even in her  most errant thought, apply her reasoning, or even dream of its following  out either the duties, the responsibilities, or the consequences of  having a husband.  She had a vague longing for younger companionship, and  of the kind naturally most interesting to her.  There thought stopped.    One only of her male acquaintances did not at this time appear.  Leonard  Everard, who had some time ago finished his course at college, was living  partly in London and partly on the Continent.  His very absence made him  of added interest to his old play-fellow.  The image of his grace and  comeliness, of his dominance and masculine force, early impressed on her  mind, began to compare favourably with the actualities of her other  friends; those of them at least who were within the circle of her  personal interest.  'Absence makes the heart grow fonder.'  In Stephen's  mind had been but a very mustard-seed of fondness.  But new lights were  breaking for her; and all of them, in greater or lesser degree, shone in  turn on the memory of the pretty self-willed dominant boy, who now grew  larger and more masculine in stature under the instance of each  successive light.  Stephen knew the others fairly well through and  through.  The usual mixture of good and evil, of strength and weakness,  of purpose and vacillation, was quite within the scope of her own feeling  and of her observation.  But this man was something of a problem to her;  and, as such, had a prominence in her thoughts quite beyond his own  worthiness.    In movement of some form is life; and even ideas grow when the pulses  beat and thought quickens.  Stephen had long had in her mind the idea of  sexual equality.  For a long time, in deference to her aunt's feelings,  she had not spoken of it; for the old lady winced in general under any  suggestion of a breach of convention.  But though her outward expression  being thus curbed had helped to suppress or minimise the opportunities of  inward thought, the idea had never left her.  Now, when sex was,  consciously or unconsciously, a dominating factor in her thoughts, the  dormant idea woke to new life.  She had held that if men and women were  equal the woman should have equal rights and opportunities as the man.  It  had been, she believed, an absurd conventional rule that such a thing as  a proposal of marriage should be entirely the prerogative of man.    And then came to her, as it ever does to woman, opportunity.  Opportunity,  the cruelest, most remorseless, most unsparing, subtlest foe that  womanhood has.  Here was an opportunity for her to test her own theory;  to prove to herself, and others, that she was right.  They--'they' being  the impersonal opponents of, or unbelievers in, her theory--would see  that a woman could propose as well as a man; and that the result would be  good.    It is a part of self-satisfaction, and perhaps not the least dangerous  part of it, that it has an increasing or multiplying power of its own.  The desire to do increases the power to do; and desire and power united  find new ways for the exercise of strength.  Up to now Stephen's  inclination towards Leonard had been vague, nebulous; but now that theory  showed a way to its utilisation it forthwith began to become, first  definite, then concrete, then substantial.  When once the idea had become  a possibility, the mere passing of time did the rest.    Her aunt saw--and misunderstood.  The lesson of her own youth had not  been applied; not even of those long hours and days and weeks at which  she hinted when she had spoken of the tragedy of life which by inference  was her own tragedy: 'to love and to be helpless.  To wait, and wait, and  wait, with your heart all aflame!'    Stephen recognised her aunt's concern for her health in time to protect  herself from the curiosity of her loving-kindness.  Her youth and  readiness and adaptability, and that power of play-acting which we all  have within us and of which she had her share, stood to her.  With but  little effort, based on a seeming acquiescence in her aunt's views, she  succeeded in convincing the old lady that her incipient feverish cold had  already reached its crisis and was passing away.  But she had gained  certain knowledge in the playing of her little part.  All this  self-protective instinct was new; for good or ill she had advanced one  more step in not only the knowledge but the power of duplicity which is  so necessary in the conventional life of a woman.    Oh! did we but see!  Could we but see!  Here was a woman, dowered in her  youth with all the goods and graces in the power of the gods to bestow,  who fought against convention; and who yet found in convention the  strongest as well as the readiest weapon of defence.    For nearly two weeks Stephen's resolution was held motionless, neither  advancing nor receding; it was veritably the slack water of her  resolution.  She was afraid to go on.  Not afraid in sense of fear as it  is usually understood, but with the opposition of virginal instincts;  those instincts which are natural, but whose uses as well as whose powers  are unknown to us.          CHAPTER X--THE RESOLVE      The next few days saw Stephen abnormally restless.  She had fairly well  made up her mind to test her theory of equality of the sexes by asking  Leonard Everard to marry her; but her difficulty was as to the doing it.  She knew well that it would not do to depend on a chance meeting for an  opportunity.  After all, the matter was too serious to allow of the  possibility of levity.  There were times when she thought she would write  to him and make her proffer of affection in this way; but on every  occasion when such thought recurred it was forthwith instantly abandoned.  During the last few days, however, she became more reconciled to even  this method of procedure.  The fever of growth was unabated.  At last  came an evening which she had all to herself.  Miss Laetitia was going  over to Norwood to look after matters there, and would remain the night.  Stephen saw in her absence an opportunity for thought and action, and  said that, having a headache, she would remain at home.  Her aunt offered  to postpone her visit.  But she would not hear of it; and so she had the  evening to herself.    After dinner in her boudoir she set herself to the composition of a  letter to Leonard which would convey at least something of her feelings  and wishes towards him.  In the depths of her heart, which now and again  beat furiously, she had a secret hope that when once the idea was  broached Leonard would do the rest.  And as she thought of that 'rest' a  languorous dreaminess came upon her.  She thought how he would come to  her full of love, of yearning passion; how she would try to keep towards  him, at first, an independent front which would preserve her secret  anxiety until the time should come when she might yield herself to his  arms and tell him all.  For hours she wrote letter after letter,  destroying them as quickly as she wrote, as she found that she had but  swayed pendulum fashion between overtness and coldness.  Some of the  letters were so chilly in tone that she felt they would defeat their own  object.  Others were so frankly warm in the expression of--regard she  called it, that with burning blushes she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2526"],[0,"The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: The Book of the Spiritual Man (#13)"],[1,"as a divine and immortal  individuality.    36. Thereupon are born the divine power of intuition, and the hearing,  the touch, the vision, the taste and the power of smell of the spiritual  man.    When, in virtue of the perpetual sacrifice of the personal man, daily  and hourly giving his life for his divine brother the spiritual man, and  through the radiance ever pouring down from the Higher Self, eternal  in the Heavens, the spiritual man comes to birth,-there awake in him  those powers whose physical counterparts we know in the personal  man. The spiritual man begins to see, to hear, to touch, to taste. And,  besides the senses of the spiritual man, there awakes his mind, that  divine counterpart of the mind of the physical man, the power of  direct and immediate knowledge, the power of spiritual intuition, of  divination. This power, as we have seen, owes its virtue to the unity,  the continuity, of consciousness, whereby whatever is known to any  consciousness, is knowable by any other consciousness. Thus the  consciousness of the spiritual man, who lives above our narrow  barriers of separateness, is in intimate touch with the consciousness of  the great Companions, and can draw on that vast reservoir for all real  needs. Thus arises within the spiritual man that certain knowledge  which is called intuition, divination, illumination.    37. These powers stand in contradistinction to the highest spiritual  vision. In manifestation they are called magical powers.    The divine man is destined to supersede the spiritual man, as the  spiritual man supersedes the natural man. Then the disciple becomes  a Master. The opened powers of tile spiritual man, spiritual vision,  hearing, and touch, stand, therefore, in contradistinction to the higher  divine power above them, and must in no wise be regarded as the end  of the way, for the path has no end, but rises ever to higher and higher  glories; the soul's growth and splendour have no limit. So that, if the  spiritual powers we have been considering are regarded as in any  sense final, they are a hindrance, a barrier to the far higher powers of  the divine man. But viewed from below, from the standpoint of  normal physical experience, they are powers truly magical; as the  powers natural to a four-dimensional being will appear magical to a  three-dimensional being.    38. Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning  the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other  body.    In due time, after the spiritual man has been formed and grown stable  through the forces and virtues already enumerated, and after the  senses of the spiritual man have awaked, there comes the transfer of  the dominant consciousness, the sense of individuality, from the  physical to the spiritual man. Thereafter the physical man is felt to be  a secondary, a subordinate, an instrument through whom the spiritual  man works; and the spiritual man is felt to be the real individuality.  This is, in a sense, the attainment to full salvation and immortal life;  yet it is not the final goal or resting place, but only the beginning of  the greater way.    The means for this transfer are described as the weakening of the  causes of bondage, and an understanding of the method of passing  from the one consciousness to the other. The first may also be  described as detach meet, and comes from the conquest of the  delusion that the personal self is the real man. When that delusion  abates and is held in check, the finer consciousness of the spiritual  man begins to shine in the background of the mind. The transfer of the  sense of individuality to this finer consciousness, and thus to the  spiritual man, then becomes a matter of recollection, of attention;  primarily, a matter of taking a deeper interest in the life and doings of  the spiritual man, than in the pleasures or occupations of the  personality. Therefore it is said: \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures  upon earth, where moth and rust cloth corrupt, and where thieves  break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,  where neither moth nor rust cloth corrupt, and where thieves do not  break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your  heart be also.\"    39. Through mastery of the upward-life comes freedom from the  dangers of water, morass, and thorny places, and the power of  ascension is gained.    Here is one of the sentences, so characteristic of this author, and,  indeed, of the Eastern spirit, in which there is an obvious exterior  meaning, and, within this, a clear interior meaning, not quite so  obvious, but far more vital.    The surface meaning is, that by mastery of a certain power, called here  the upward-life, and akin to levitation, there comes the ability to walk  on water, or to pass over thorny places without wounding the feet.    But there is a deeper meaning. When we speak of the disciple's path  as a path of thorns, we use a symbol; and the same symbol is used  here. The upward-life means something more than the power, often  manifested in abnormal psychical experiences, of levitating the  physical body, or near-by physical objects. It means the strong power  of aspiration, of upward will, which first builds, and then awakes the  spiritual man, and finally transfers the conscious individuality to him;  for it is he who passes safely over the waters of death and rebirth, and  is not pierced by the thorns in the path. Therefore it is said that he  who would tread the path of power must look for a home in the air,  and afterwards in the ether.    Of the upward-life, this is written in the Katha Upanishad: \"A hundred  and one are the heart's channels; of these one passes to the crown.  Going up this, he comes to the immortal.\" This is the power of  ascension spoken of in the Sutra.    40. By mastery of the binding-life comes radiance.    In the Upanishads, it is said that this binding-life unites the upward-life  to the downward-life, and these lives have their analogies in the \"vital  breaths\" in the body. The thought in the text seems to be, that, when  the personality is brought thoroughly under control of the spiritual  man, through the life-currents which bind them together, the personality  is endowed with a new force, a strong personal magnetism, one  might call it, such as is often an appanage of genius.    But the text seems to mean more than this and to have in view the  \"vesture of the colour of the sun\" attributed by the Upanishads to the  spiritual man; that vesture which a disciple has thus described: \"The  Lord shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his  glorious body\"; perhaps \"body of radiance\" would better translate the  Greek.    In both these passages, the teaching seems to be, that the body of the  full-grown spiritual man is radiant or luminous,-for those at least, who  have anointed their eyes wit! eye-salve, so that they see.    41. From perfectly concentrated Meditation on the correlation of  hearing and the ether, comes the power of spiritual hearing.    Physical sound, we are told, is carried by the air, or by water, iron, or  some medium on the same plane of substance. But then is a finer  hearing, whose medium of transmission would seem to be the ether;  perhaps no that ether which carries light, heat and magnetic waves,  but, it may be, the far finer ether through which the power of gravity  works. For, while light or heat or magnetic waves, travelling from the  sun to the earth, take eight minutes for the journey, it is  mathematically certain that the pull of gravitation does not take as  much as eight seconds, or even the eighth of a second. The pull of  gravitation travels, it would seem \"as quick as thought\"; so it may well  be that, in thought transference or telepathy, the thoughts travel by the  same way, carried by the same \"thought-swift\" medium.    The transfer of a word by telepathy is the simplest and earliest form  of the \"divine hearing\" of the spiritual man; as that power grows, and  as, through perfectly concentrated Meditation, the spiritual man comes  into more complete mastery of it, he grows able to hear and clearly  distinguish the speech of the great Companions, who counsel and  comfort him on his way. They may speak to him either in wordless  thoughts, or in perfectly definite words and sentences.    42. By perfectly concentrated Meditation em the correlation of the  body with the ether, and by thinking of it as light as thistle-down, will  come the power to traverse the ether.    It has been said that he who would tread the path of power must look  for a home in the air, and afterwards in the ether. This would seem to  mean, besides the constant injunction to detachment, that he must be  prepared to inhabit first a psychic, and then an etheric body; the  former being the body of dreams; the latter, the body of the spiritual  man, when he wakes up on the other side of dreamland. The gradual  accustoming of the consciousness to its new etheric vesture, its  gradual acclimatization, so to speak, in the etheric body of the  spiritual man, is what our text seems to contemplate.    43. When that condition of consciousness is reached, which is  far-reaching and not confined to the body, which is outside the body  and not conditioned by it, then the veil which conceals the light is  worn away.    Perhaps the best comment on this is afforded by the words of Paul: \"I  knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body,  I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)  such a one caught up to the third heaven. And I knew such a man,  (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)  how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable  [or, unspoken] words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.\"    The condition is, briefly, that of the awakened spiritual man, who sees  and hears beyond the veil.
