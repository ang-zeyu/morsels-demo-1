They do not seem to be as regular in  their movements as other Swallows here; some years I have observed them  passing singly or in small parties during the entire hot season: usually  they begin to appear, flying north, in February; but in some years not  until after the middle of March. They are not seen passing with a rapid  flight in close flocks, but straggle about, hawking after flies: first  one bird passing, then two or three, and a minute or two later half a  dozen, and so on for a greater part of the day. So long as the weather  continues warm they journey in this leisurely manner; but I have known  them to continue passing till April, after all the summer migrants had  left us, and these late birds flew by with great speed in small close  flocks, directly north, as if their flight had been guided by the  magnetic needle.    While flying this species continually utters sharp twitterings and  grinding and squealing notes of various lengths.      29. TACHYCINETA LEUCORRHOA (Vieill.).

This is the most abundant and best known of our Swallows; a pretty bird  in its glossy coat of deep green, and rump and under surface snowy  white; exceedingly restless in its disposition, quick and graceful in  its motions; social, quarrelsome, garrulous, with a not unmusical song,  beginning with long, soft, tremulous notes, followed by others shorter  and more hurried, and sinking to a murmur. They are the last of all our  migrants to leave us in autumn, and invariably reappear in small numbers  about the houses on every warm day in winter. Probably many individuals  in Buenos Ayres remain through the winter in sheltered situations, to  scatter over the surrounding country whenever there comes a warm bright  day. I once saw three together, skimming over the plains, on one of the  coldest days I ever experienced on the pampas, the thermometer having  stood at 29 deg. Fahr. that morning.    Further south their migration is more strict; and on the Rio Negro, in  Patagonia, from March to August I did not meet with a single individual.  In Buenos Ayres the autumnal migration of the Hirundines begins about  the middle of February, and from that date vast numbers of this Swallow  are seen travelling north, and, in some seasons, they continue passing  for over a month. One autumn, in April, several days after the Swallows  had all disappeared, flocks of the Common Swallow began again to appear  flying north, and for ten days afterwards they continued to pass in  large numbers. They would stoop to dip themselves in a pool where I  observed them, and then alight on the reeds and bushes to rest, and  appeared quite tired with their journey, rising reluctantly when  approached, and some allowing me to stand almost within arm's length  of them without stirring. I had never before observed any later or  supplementary migration like this; for, as a rule, the causes which in  some years delay the departure of birds seems to affect them all alike.  Possibly these late birds come from some remote district, where  exceptionally cold weather had retarded breeding-operations.    The White-rumped Swallow sometimes lays in a tree, in the large nest,  previously abandoned, of the Lenatero (_Anumbius acuticaudatus_).  Its favourite site is, however, a hole in a wall, sheltered by the  overhanging tiles or thatch; for though it does not go much into towns,  as Azara has remarked, it is very domestic, and there is not a house on  the pampas, however humble it be, but some of these birds are about it,  sportively skimming above the roof, or curiously peering under the  eaves, and incessantly uttering their gurgling happy notes.    For a period of a month to six weeks before building begins they seem to  be holding an incessant dispute, reminding one in their scolding tones  of a colony of contentious English House-Sparrows, only the Swallow  has a softer, more varied voice, and frequently, even when hotly  quarrelling, he pauses to warble out his pretty little song, with its  sound like running water. However many eligible chinks and holes there  may be, the contention is always just as great amongst them, and is  doubtless referable to opposing claims to the best places. The excited  twittering, the incessant striving of two birds to alight on the same  square inch of wall, the perpetual chases they lead each other round  and round the house, always ending exactly where they began, tell of  clashing interests and of great unreasonableness on the part of some  amongst them. By-and-by the quarrel assumes a more serious aspect;  friends and neighbours have apparently intervened in vain; all the  arguments of which Swallows are capable have been exhausted, and, a  compromise of claims being more impossible than ever, fighting begins.  Most vindictively do the little things clutch each other and fall to the  earth twenty times an hour, where they often remain struggling for a  long time, heedless of the screams of alarm their fellows set up above  them; for often, while they thus lie on the ground punishing each other,  they fall an easy prey to some wily pussy who has made herself  acquainted with their habits.    When these feuds are finally settled, they address themselves diligently  to the great work and build a rather big nest. They are not neat or  skilful workers, but merely stuff a great quantity of straw and other  light materials into the breeding-hole, and line the nest with feathers  and horsehair. On this soft but disorderly bed the female lays from five  to seven pure white eggs.    All those species that are liable at any time to become the victims of  raptorial birds are very much beholden to this Swallow, as he is the  most vigilant sentinel they possess. When the hurrying Falcon is still  far off, and the other birds unsuspicious of his approach, the Swallows  suddenly rush up into the sky with a wild rapid flight to announce the  evil tidings with distracted screams. The alarm spreads swift as light  through the feathered tribes, which, on all sides, are in terrified  commotion, crouching in the grass, plunging into thickets, or mounting  upwards to escape by flight. I have often wondered at this, since this  swift-winged and quick-doubling little bird is the least likely to fall  a prey himself.    They possess another habit very grateful to the mind of every early  riser. At the first indication of dawn, and before any other wild bird  has broken the profound silence of night, multitudes of this Swallow, as  if at the signal of a leader, begin their singing and twittering, at the  same time mounting upwards into the quiet dusky sky. Their notes at this  hour differ from the hurried twittering uttered during the day, being  softer and more prolonged, and, sounding far up in the sky from so many  throats, the concert has a very charming effect, and seems in harmony  with the shadowy morning twilight.      30. ATTICORA CYANOLEUCA (Vieill.).    (BANK-SWALLOW.)      +Atticora cyanoleuca+, _Burm. La-Plata Reise_, ii. p. 479; _Scl. et        Salv. Nomencl._ p. 14; _Hudson, P. Z.

B._ x. p. 186.        _Description._--Above dark glossy blue; quills and tail-feathers      black; cheeks and under surface of body pure white, the sides of the      neck blue, descending in a half-crescent on the sides of the chest;      sides of body and flanks brown; under tail-coverts black; bill and      feet black: total length 4.7 inches, wing 4.05, tail 2.2. _Female_      similar.    _Hab._ Central and South America.    This diminutive dark-plumaged species is the smallest of our Hirundines.  In Buenos Ayres they appear early in September, arriving before the  Martins, but preceded by the Common Swallow. They are bank-birds,  breeding in forsaken holes and burrows, for they never bore into  the earth themselves, and are consequently not much seen about the  habitations of man. They sometimes find their breeding-holes in the  banks of streams, or, in cultivated districts, in the sides of ditches,  and even down in wells. But if in such sites alone fit receptacles for  their eggs were met with, the species, instead of one of the commonest,  would be rare indeed with us; for on the level pampas most of the  water-courses have marshy borders, or at most but low and gently  sloping banks. But the burrowing habits of two other animals--the  Vizcacha (_Lagostomus trichodactylus_), the common large rodent  of the pampas, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38959"],[0,"Comparative Ecology of Pinyon Mice and Deer Mice in Mesa Verde National Park, (#13)"],[1,"of animals was found to prevent, or at least  retard, retraction of the testes. Retraction of the testes from the  scrotum was not a problem at the height of the breeding season when the  testes were engorged.    I had originally assumed that all adult males would be fertile  throughout the breeding season, and that any males with abdominal testes  would be subadults or young of the year. This assumption was an  oversimplification; all adult males did not reach breeding condition at  the same time of year. My data do not support a firm conclusion, for it  is difficult to follow non-captive individuals throughout a breeding  season, owing to sporadic appearance of animals in traps. Nevertheless,  observations of mice that were trapped a number of times indicated the  following:    1) Some adult males that had abdominal testes in the middle of July  reached breeding condition as late as late August and even late  September.    2) Some juvenal males had scrotal testes at the time their postjuvenal  molt was just beginning to be apparent on their sides. Most juvenal  males did not have scrotal testes, and many juveniles that appeared  repeatedly in traps from mid-July through late October did not attain  breeding condition. A mouse that was a juvenile in mid-July must have  been born in mid-June.    3) Apparently animals born early in the breeding season may reproduce  later in that season, whereas those born later in the breeding season  tend not to breed until the following year.    Possibly cooler evening temperatures in July and August, due to the  relatively larger amounts of precipitation in those months, inhibit  reproductive development of late-born young. Most plants have ceased  vegetative growth and have produced seeds by this time; but the  interrelationships between growing seasons, climatic conditions, and  reproductive physiology are unknown.    Only one adult of each species had scrotal testes after late September;  the _P. truei_ had scrotal testes on October 24, 1963, and the _P.  maniculatus_ had scrotal testes on October 15 of that year.          GROWTH      Growth of captive _P. maniculatus_ and _P. truei_ is discussed in  several reports. One of the most complete is that of McCabe and  Blanchard (1950) on _P. m. gambelii_ and _P. t. gilberti_ in California.  A detailed discussion of the dentition in _P. truei_ and wear of the  teeth in different age groups is given by Hoffmeister (1951). Molt in  these species has been considered by a number of authors (Collins, 1918;  McCabe and Blanchard, 1950; Hoffmeister, 1951; Anderson, 1961). The  report by McCabe and Blanchard is valuable because molt is compared  between the two species from the first to the twenty-first week of  postnatal development.        [Illustration: FIG. 18: Scatter diagram of postnatal growth of         captive mice, showing increase in length of bodies from birth to         70 days of age. The records for _P. truei_ represent 11         individuals of five litters; those for _P. maniculatus_ represent         17 individuals of four litters.]    The thoroughness of the above-mentioned studies is readily apparent to  those who have worked with mice of the genus _Peromyscus_. Nevertheless,  the ecology of local populations of _P. maniculatus_ and _P. truei_ as  reported for the San Francisco Bay area (McCabe and Blanchard, 1950) has  little relationship to the ecology of mice of other subspecies of these  species, in southwestern Colorado. Indeed, the preferred habitats, and  to some extent the behavior, differ strikingly in Colorado and  California.        [Illustration: FIG. 19: Graphs showing postnatal growth of solitary         captive individuals of _P. truei_ and _P. maniculatus_,         representing the only young in each of two litters.]    Figures 18 and 19 show that some litters grow appreciably faster than  others, but the end results are about the same. Since the young were  measured at irregular intervals, statistical procedures for calculating  confidence limits of the curves were not applicable.    Solitary young reared by one female of each species, attained maximum  size more rapidly than animals having litter mates (Fig. 19).  Nevertheless, solitary individuals and individuals from litters all  reach essentially the same size 50 days after birth.    The gestation time of _P. truei_ is several days longer than that of _P.  maniculatus_, and the young of _truei_ are fewer and heavier than those  of _maniculatus_. As would be expected, _truei_ remains in the nest  longer and nurses longer than _maniculatus_.    Young of each species grow rapidly for the first month, and attain, in  that time, the largest percentage of their adult size; they grow rapidly  up to sometime between the thirtieth and fiftieth days. Thereafter the  rate of growth diminishes and the animals begin to gain weight rather  than continuing to extend the lengths of the body and appendages.    Figure 19 reveals that the appendages of young _maniculatus_ attain most  of their length about a week earlier than those of _truei_. Young  _truei_ acquire mobility and coordination somewhat later than young  _maniculatus_, but both species are seemingly equal in these respects by  about the end of the second week.    Length of gestation period, number and size of embryos, amount of time  spent in the nest, and time required for bodily growth are all of major  importance in determining the relative success of _truei_ and  _maniculatus_. These parameters will be considered further in the  discussion.          PARENTAL BEHAVIOR      In the laboratory, pregnant females were supplied with either kapok,  cotton, or a piece of burlap with which to make a nest. The kapok or  cotton was used directly by the mice in constructing a hollow, compact,  moundlike nest. When burlap was used for nest building, the female first  completely frayed the cloth by chewing it into a fluffy mass of fibers.    When the top of a nest was opened to inspect young, the female would  attempt to pull the nesting material back into shape by means of  forefeet and teeth. The mother's defensive posture was to cover the  young with her body, often lying over them and facing upward, toward the  investigator. In this semi-recumbent position, the female would attack  the investigator's fingers with her forefeet and teeth. Often the female  would stand bipedally and use the forefeet and teeth to mount the  attack. If at this time a young chanced to wander away from the mother,  she would quickly pick it up and place it in the nest at her feet.    When disturbed, females of both species, but especially _P.  maniculatus_, often dove headlong under their nest or into the wood  shavings on the floor of the cage. This type of retreat was most often  used when young were nursing. Time is required even by the mother to  disengage nursing young, and this mode of escape is the most expedient.  The mother disengaged nursing young by licking around their faces and  pushing with her paws.    Nursing females of both species tolerated the male parent in the nest. A  male and female often sat side by side in the nest and by means of their  bodies participated in covering the young. Males were not observed to  attempt any defense of the nest, or of the young. Females were tolerant  of older young in the nest when another litter was born and was being  nursed. In one nest, a female of _P. truei_ gave birth to a litter of  three when her older litter was 29 days old. The three older young  continued to nurse until they were 37 days old, at which time they were  removed from the cage. The female appeared tolerant of this nursing by  members of the older litter, but appeared to give preference to the  wants of the younger offspring.    One female of _P. truei_ lost or killed all but one young of her litter;  at about the same time, a _P. maniculatus_ and all but one of her young  inexplicably died. Since the remaining young _maniculatus_, a male, was  just weaned and was considered expendable, I placed him in the cage with  the female _truei_ and her 33-day-old, male offspring. The reaction to  the newcomer was unexpected. The female immediately covered the _P.  maniculatus_ and her own young and prepared to defend them against me.  Later, when the _P. maniculatus_ was disturbed, he had only to emit a  squeak and the female _truei_ would run to cover and protect him. When  the young male of _P. truei_ was 69 days old the female kept him out of  the nest, but still kept the male _maniculatus_ in the nest with her.  Although the female was somewhat antagonistic to her own young, she did  not injure him, but only kept him out of the nest. The male _truei_ was  left in the cage with his mother and the _P. maniculatus_ from September  23 to December 10. None of the mice had any apparent cuts on the ears or  tail to indicate fighting. As much as seven months after the _P.  maniculatus_ was introduced into the cage, the female _truei_ continued  to cover him with her body whenever there was a disturbance. The male  _maniculatus_ not only tolerated this attention, but ran under the  female _truei_ when frightened. \"Adoption\" of young of another species  has been reported for a number of animals, but, without further  evidence, it is not possible to postulate that such adoptions occur  between species of _Peromyscus_ in nature.    Young males are tolerated by their mothers after weaning. One young male  _maniculatus_ was left in the cage with his mother from the time of his  birth in autumn until late February of the following year. A litter was  born on February 24. A young male _P. truei_ was also left in the cage  with his mother until he had acquired most of his postjuvenal pelage;  the female and male usually sat together in the cage.    Females of both species sometimes eat their young when the young die  shortly after birth. One female of each species killed three of her four  young, and ate their brains "]]]
