Tired  of walking, I sat down on a root in the shelter of a large oak,  and remained there perfectly motionless for about an hour. But the  birds never lost their suspicion; all the time the distant subdued  tempest of sharp notes went on, occasionally dying down until it  nearly ceased, then suddenly rising and spreading again until I  was ringed round with the sound. At length the loud, sharp  invitation or order to fly was given and taken up by many birds;  then, through the opening among the trees before me, I saw them  rise in a dense flock and circle about at a distance: other flocks  rose on the right and left hands and joined the first; and finally  the whole mass come slowly overhead as if to explore; but when the  foremost birds were directly over me the flock divided into two  columns, which deployed to the right and left, and at a distance  poured again into the trees. There could not have been fewer than  two thousand birds in the flock that came over me, and they were  probably all building in that part of the forest.    The daw, whether tame or distrustful of man, is always  interesting. Here I was even more interested in the jays, and it  was indeed chiefly for the pleasure of seeing them, when they are  best to look at, that I visited this forest. I had also  formed the idea that there was no place in England where the jay  could be seen to better advantage, as they are, or until recently  were, exceedingly abundant at Savernake, and were not in constant  fear of the keeper and his everlasting gun. Here one could witness  their early spring assemblies, when the jay, beautiful at all  times, is seen at his very best.    It is necessary to say here that this habit of the jay does not appear  to be too well known to our ornithologists. When I stated in a small  work on British Birds a few years ago that jays had the custom of  congregating in spring, a distinguished naturalist, who reviewed the  book in one of the papers, rebuked me for so absurd a statement, and  informed me that the jay is a solitary bird except at the end of  summer and in the early autumn, when they are sometimes seen in  families. If I had not made it a rule never to reply to a critic, I  could have informed this one that I knew exactly where his knowledge  of the habits of the jay was derived-that it dated back to a book  published ninety-nine years ago. It was a very good book, and all it  contains, some errors included, have been incorporated in most of the  important ornithological works which have appeared during the  nineteenth century. But though my critic thus \"wrote it all by rote,\"  according to the books, \"he did not write it right.\" The ancient error  has not, however, been repeated by all writers on the subject.  Seebohm, in his History of British Birds, wrote: \"Sometimes,  especially in Spring, fortune may favour you, and you will see a  regular gathering of these noisy birds.... It is only at this time  that the jay displays a social disposition; and the birds may often be  heard to utter a great variety of notes, some of the modulations  approaching almost to a song.\"    The truth of the statement I have made that most of our writers on  birds have strictly followed Montague in his account of the jay's  habits, unmistakably shows itself in all they say about the bird's  language. Montagu wrote in his famous Dictionary of Birds (1802):--    \"Its common notes are various, but harsh; will sometimes in spring  utter a sort of song in a soft and pleasing manner, but so low as  not to be heard at any distance; and at intervals introduce the  bleatings of a Lamb, mewing of a Cat, the note of a Kite or  Buzzard, hooting of an Owl, and even the neighing of a Horse.    \"These imitations are so exact, even in a natural wild state, that  we have frequently been deceived.\"    This description somewhat amplified, and the wording  varied to suit the writer's style, has been copied into most books  on British birds--the lamb and the cat, and the kite and the horse,  faithfully appearing in most cases. Yet it is certain that if all  the writers had listened to the jay's vocal performances for  themselves, they would have given a different account. It is not  that Montagu was wrong: he went to nature for his facts and put  down what he heard, or thought he heard, but the particular sounds  which he describes they would not have heard.    My experience is, that the same notes and phrases are not  ordinarily heard in any two localities; that the bird is able to  emit a great variety of sounds--some highly musical; that he is  also a great mimic in a wild irregular way, mixing borrowed notes  with his own, and flinging them out anyhow, so that there is no  order nor harmony, and they do not form a song.    But he also has a real song, which may be heard in any assembly of  jays and from some male birds after the congregating season is  over and breeding is in progress. This singing of the jay is  somewhat of a puzzle, as it is not the same song in any two  places, and gives one the idea that there is no inherited and no  traditional song in this species, but that each bird that  has a song has invented it for himself. It varies from \"a sort of  low song,\" as Montagu said,--a soft chatter and warble which one  can just hear at a distance of thirty or forty yards,--to a song  composed of several musical notes harmoniously arranged, which may  be heard distinctly a quarter of a mile away. This set and  far-reaching song is rare, but some birds have a single very  powerful and musical note, or short phrase, which they repeat at  regular intervals by way of song. If by following up the sound one  can get near enough to the tree where the meeting is being held to  see what is going on, it is most interesting to watch the  vocalist, who is like a leader, and who, perched quietly,  continues to repeat that one powerful, unchanging, measured sound  in the midst of a continuous concert of more or less musical  sounds from the other birds.    What I should very much like to know is, whether these powerful  and peculiar notes, phrases, and songs of the jay, which are  clearly not imitations of other species, are repeated year after  year by the birds in the same localities, or are dropped for ever  or forgotten at the end of each season. It is hard for me to find  this out, because I do not as a rule revisit the same places in  spring, and on going to a new or a different spot I find  that the birds utter different sounds. Again, the places where  jays assemble in numbers are very few and far between. It is true,  as an observant gamekeeper once said to me, that if there are as  many as half a dozen to a dozen jays in any wood they will  contrive to hold a meeting; but when the birds are few and much  persecuted, it is difficult to see and hear them at such times,  and when seen and heard, no adequate idea is formed of the beauty  of their displays, and the power and variety of their language, as  witnessed in localities where they are numerous, and fear of the  keeper's gun has not damped their mad, jubilant spirits.    In genial weather the jays' assembly may be held at any hour, but  is most frequently seen during the early part of the day: on a  fine warm morning in March and April one can always count on  witnessing an assembly, or at all events of hearing the birds, in  any wood where they are fairly common and not very shy. They are  so vociferous and so conspicuous to the eye during these social  intervals, and at the same time so carried away by excitement,  that it is not only easy to find and see them, but possible at  times to observe them very closely.    The loud rasping alarm- and angry-cry of the jay is a  sound familiar to every one; the cry used by the bird to call his  fellows together is somewhat different. It resembles the cry or  call of the carrion crow, in localities where that bird is not  persecuted, when, in the love season, he takes his stand on the  top of the nesting-tree and calls with a prolonged, harsh,  grating, and exceedingly powerful note, many times repeated. The  jay's call has the same grating or grinding character, but is  louder, sharper, more prolonged, and in a quiet atmosphere may be  heard distinctly a mile away. The wood is in an uproar when the  birds assemble and scream in concert while madly pursuing one  another over the tall trees.    At such times the peculiar flight of the jay is best seen and is very  beautiful. In almost all birds that have short, round wings, as we may  see in our little wren, and in game birds, and the sparrow-hawk, and  several others, the wing-beats are exceedingly rapid. This is the case  with the magpie; the quickness of the wing-beats causes the black and  white on the quills to mingle and appear a misty grey; but at short  intervals the bird glides and the wings appear black and white again.  The jay, although his wings are so short and round, when not in a  hurry progresses by means of comparatively slow, measured wing-beats,  and looks as if swimming rather than flying.    It is when the gathered birds all finally settle on a tree that they  are most to be admired. They will sometimes remain on the spot for  half an hour or longer, displaying their graces and emitting the  extraordinary medley of noises mixed with musical sounds. But they do  not often sit still at such times; if there are many birds, and the  excitement is great, some of them are perpetually moving, jumping and  flitting from branch to branch, and springing into the air to wheel  round or pass over the tree, all apparently intent on showing off  their various colours--vinaceous brown, sky blue, velvet black,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37814"],[0,"The Story of Magellan and The Discovery of the Philippines (#13)"],[1," that cheered Columbus and his men--the  mariners' hymn to the Virgin:        \"Gentle Star of Ocean!        Portal of the sky!      Ever Virgin Mother        Of the Lord most high!\"    \"Wednesday, the 20th of November, 1520,\" says the original narrative,  \"we came forth out of the same strait, and entered the Pacific Sea.\"    The ships sailed on into the calm mystery of the ocean, the soul of  Magellan glowing. But though the Admiral had risen superior to so many  obstacles, there were others to be met. The sea was indeed placid and  full of promise, but starvation now stared him in the face, and after  the spectre of Treason had departed that of Famine appeared.    Day after day the sun arose on the same serenity of sea. One month  passed, and still there spread before the ships the same infinite ocean.  Another month passed, and another, and twenty days more.    How did the crews live on this long voyage of silence and calms?    The narrative says: \"We only ate old biscuit reduced to powder, and full  of grubs, and we drank water that had turned yellow and smelled.\"    But a more perilous diet had to be followed.    They ate the \"ox hides that were under the main yard.\" To eat these  hides they had to soak them for some days in the sea, and then cook them  on embers.    They ate sawdust; then the vermin on the ships.    A worse condition came. The gums of the men swelled from such food, so  that many of them could not eat at all, and nineteen died. Beside those  who died, twenty-five fell ill of \"divers sicknesses.\"    Kind-hearted Pigafetta, who was always true to the Portuguese Admiral,  formed an intimacy with the poor young giant, presumably with the giant  whose wife had been left behind. This giant was imprisoned on the  flagship of Magellan.    One day the giant said to him, helplessly:    \"Capac.\"    Our Italian understood that this must be the Patagonian word for bread.  So he wrote it down, and the giant saw that he was interested in the  meaning of his native words.    So the young giant began to teach the young Italian.    \"Her-dem\" meant a chief.    \"Holi\" meant water.    \"Ohone,\" a storm.    \"Setebos,\" the Unseen Power.    They studied together for a time, and shared each other's good will.    One day the Italian drew a cross on paper. The young giant raised it to  his lips and kissed it, as he had seen Pigafetta kiss the sign of the  Cross.    But he said by signs: \"Do not make the Cross again, else Setebos will  enter into you and kill you.\"    The meaning of the cross was explained to him.    The poor giant fell ill at last, amid all the misery.    \"Bring me the Cross,\" he said by signs.    He kissed it again.    He knew that he would soon die.    \"Make me a Christian,\" he said.    They named him \"Paul,\" and baptized him.    One day found him dead, and they cast his great frame into the sea. He  was probably the first convert to the faith among Patagonians, and his  so-called conversion was the heart's cry in helplessness.    The other giant may have lived to see the days of famine, when men  shrank and death threatened all. Then he, too, famished and died, and  found a grave in the sea. Another account, makes this giant die on the  Antonio before that ship went back to St. Julian.    Two islands only appeared in the months of steady sailing. They were  uninhabited except by birds. The sky in all this time brought no storm.    In these days of ocean solitude, hunger, and death, Magellan was sure  always of the faith of two true hearts--the susceptible Italian and Del  Cano.    Magellan dreamed of the fate of Mesquita in these strange experiences,  and Mesquita in his lonely prison thought continually of him. Would  Magellan ever return? the latter must have asked daily.    If so, his prison doors might swing open. He had no other hope, but this  hope was a star. Magellan's wife must have shared this hope with the  prisoner.          CHAPTER XV.    WELCOME TO THE PHILIPPINES!      On Wednesday, March 6th, Magellan sighted islands. His lantern had  crossed the Pacific Ocean. Here he hoped to find food. He approached the  shores eagerly. So hungry were the crews that one of the sick men begged  that if any of the natives were killed human flesh might be brought him.    But the natives here were not only wild men, they were robbers; they  sought to kill the voyagers and to steal everything. Hence, Magellan  called the islands the Ladrones (robbers).    The robbers threw stones at the famishing mariners as the ships turned  away in search of more hospitable shores. The women were dressed in  bark.    The ships moved on into unknown seas.    On Saturday, March 16, 1521, a notable sight appeared in the dawn of the  morning. It was a high bluff, some three hundred leagues distant from  the Thieves' Islands. The island was named Zamal, now called Samar.    Magellan saw another island near. It was inhabited by a friendly  people. He determined to land there for the sake of security, as he  could there gather sea food and care for the sick. He planted his tents  there, and provided the sick with fresh meat.    Where was he?    Here surely was a new archipelago which had found no place on a map.  March 16, 1521, was to be a notable date of the world.    He had discovered the Philippine Islands, though they were not then  known by that name. They were the door to China from the West--this he  could hardly have known.    The islands as now known consist of Luzon, fifty-one thousand three  hundred square miles in extent; and Mendanao, more than twenty-five  thousand miles in extent. The islands lying between Luzon and Mendanao  are called the Bissayas, of which Samar has an area of thirteen thousand  and twenty miles. Magellan visited Mendanao and then sailed for Zebu, a  small island where the first Spanish settlement was made, before Manila,  which was founded in 1581.    This archipelago was a new world of wonder. The small islands are now  computed to number fourteen hundred. Magellan never knew the extent of  his discovery.    Here he was to find the happiest days of his life, after the serene but  famishing voyage.    The people here were to receive him with open arms; to feast him; to  raise his expectations and to bow down before the Cross. We must  describe in detail--thanks to the Italian who was true to the heart of  the Admiral--this golden age of the troubled life of Magellan.    After all the struggle for so many years against many overwhelming  oppositions, Magellan now rose into the vantage ground of success, and  fulfilled the vision which had illumined his soul in his darkest hours.    Every man has a right to his record, and whatever might happen now, his  record no power could destroy; he had discovered the Pacific Ocean, and  a new way around the world. Whatever might be his fate, the world must  follow his lantern.    On the 18th of March, 1521, after dinner on shore, the Admiral saw a  boat coming out from a near island toward his ship. There were men in  it.    \"Let no one move or speak,\" said Magellan.    The crews awaited the coming of the strangers in the blazing sunlight of  the tropic sea. The Indians landed, led by a chief.    They were friends. They signified by signs their joy at seeing them.  Magellan feasted the Indians and gave them presents.    When these people saw the good disposition of the Captain, they gave him  palm wine and figs \"more than a foot long.\" On leaving they promised to  return with fruits.    Pigafetta, our Italian Chevalier, vividly describes the scenes that  followed between Magellan and the friendly people of the  newly-discovered islands, which we call the Philippines, but which were  not so named at that time.    He tells us in a wonderfully interesting narrative a translation of  which we closely follow:    \"That people became very familiar and friendly, and explained many  things in their language, and told the names of some islands which they  beheld. The island where they dwelt was called Zuluam, and it was not  large. As they were sufficiently agreeable and conversible the crews had  great pleasure with them. The Captain seeing that they were of this good  spirit, conducted them to the ship and showed them specimens of all his  goods--that he most desired--cloves, cinnamon, pepper, ginger, nutmeg,  mace, and gold.    \"He also had shots fired with his artillery, at which they were so much  afraid that they wished to jump from the ship into the sea. They made  signs that the things which the Captain had shown them grew there.    \"When they wished to go they took leave of the Captain and of the crew  with very good manners and gracefulness, promising to come back.    \"The island where the ships had moored was named Humunu; but because  the men found there two springs of very fresh water it was named the  Watering Place of Good Signs. There was much white coral there, and  large trees which bear fruit smaller than an almond, and which are like  pines. There were also many palm trees both good and bad. In this place  there were many circumjacent islands, on which account the archipelago  was named St. Lazarus. This region and archipelago is in ten degrees  north latitude, and a hundred and sixty-one degrees longitude from the  line of demarcation.    \"Friday, the 22d of March, the above-mentioned people, who had promised  to return, came about midday with two boats laden with the said fruit,  cochi, sweet oranges, a vessel of palm wine, and a cock, to give us to  understand that they had poultry in their country.\" The Italian thus  describes the habits of the people:    \"The lord of these people was old, and had his face painted, and had  gold rings suspended to his ears, which they name 'schione,' and the  others had many bracelets and rings of gold on their arms, with a  wrapper of linen round their head. We remained at this place eight days;  the Captain went there every day to see his sick men, whom he had placed  on this island to refresh"]]]
