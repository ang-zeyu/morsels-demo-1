In this disease there is a serous, or watery, effusion in the cavity of the  abdomen.    _Causes._--When old animals are fed on innutritious feed or when reduced by  disease, they become anemic; in other words, their blood becomes  impoverished and dropsy may follow. An innutritious and insufficient diet  produces the same effect in young animals. It is one of the results of  peritonitis, and may also arise from acute or chronic inflammation of the  liver, such as is of common occurrence when flukes are present in the liver  in large numbers. Heart disease and chronic lung disease may be followed by  ascites. It is sometimes, in calves, a symptom of infestation with worms.    _Symptoms._--A gradual increase in the size of the abdomen at its lower  part, while the flanks becomes hollow; pallor of the mucous membrane of the  mouth and eye; weak and sluggish gait; want of appetite, and irregularity  in ruminating. On percussion or tapping the surface of the abdomen with the  fingers, a dull sound is produced. If the hand and arm are oiled and passed  into the rectum as far as possible, on moving the hand from one side to the  other the fluctuation caused by the presence of fluid in the abdomen may be  felt.    _Treatment._--If possible the cause must be discovered and removed. The  diet should be nutritious, and in those cases in which we have merely to  deal with anemia (the bloodless state) arising from insufficient diet, the  use of tonics and diuretics, at the same time keeping the skin warm, may  bring about a gradual absorption of the fluid contained in the abdomen. One  of the following powders may be mixed with the animal's feed three times a  day; or, if there is any uncertainty as to its being taken in that way, it  should be mixed with sirup, so as to form a paste, and smeared well back on  the animal's tongue with a flat wooden spoon: Carbonate of iron, 3 ounces;  powdered gentian, 3 ounces; powdered nitrate of potassium, 3 ounces; mix  and divide into 12 powders. The administration of purgatives which promote  a watery discharge from the mucous surface of the bowels also tends, by  diminishing the serum of the blood, to bring about absorption and a gradual  removal of the fluid contained in the abdomen. Large doses should not be  given, but moderate ones should be administered morning and night, so as to  produce a laxative effect on the bowels for several days. To attain this  end the following may be used: Sulphate of soda, 8 ounces; powdered ginger,  half an ounce; to be mixed in 2 quarts of tepid water and given at one  dose.         *       *       *       *       *    DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.    DESCRIPTION OF PLATES.    PLATE I. Position of the first stomach (rumen or paunch) on the left side.  The area inclosed by heavy dotted lines represents the rumen; the  elongated, shaded organ is the spleen resting upon it. The skin and muscles  have been removed from the ribs to show the position of the lungs and their  relation to the paunch.    PLATE II. Stomach of ruminants.    Fig. 1. Stomach of a full-grown sheep, 1/5 natural size (after Thanhoffer,  from R. Meade Smith's Physiology of Domestic Animals): _a_, rumen, or first  stomach; _b_, reticulum, or second stomach; _c_, omasum, or third stomach;  _d_, abomasum, or fourth stomach; _e_, esophagus, or gullet, opening into  the first and second stomachs; _f_, opening of fourth stomach into small  intestine; _g_, opening of second stomach into third; _h_, opening of third  stomach into fourth.    The lines indicate the course of the food in the stomachs. The incompletely  masticated food passes down the esophagus, or gullet, into the first and  second stomachs, in which a churning motion is kept up, carrying the food  from side to side and from stomach to stomach. From the first stomach  regurgitation takes place; that is, the food is returned through the gullet  to the mouth to be more thoroughly chewed, and this constitutes what is  known as \"chewing the cud.\" From the second stomach the food passes into  the third, and from the third into the fourth, or true, stomach, and from  there into the intestines.    Fig. 2. Stomach of ox (after Colin, from R. Meade Smith's Physiology of  Domestic Animals): _a_, rumen; _b_, reticulum; _c_, omasum; _d_, abomasum;  _e_, esophagus; _f_, opening of fourth stomach into small intestine.    Fuerstenberg calculated that in an ox of 1,400 pounds weight the capacity of  the stomach is as follows:                           Per cent.

Clinical thermometer, 4/5 natural size. This is used to determine  the temperature of the animal body. The thermometer is passed into the  rectum after having been moistened with a little saliva from the mouth, or  after having had a little oil or lard rubbed upon it to facilitate its  passage. There it is allowed to remain two or three minutes, then  withdrawn, and the temperature read as in any ordinary thermometer. The  clinical thermometer is made self-registering; that is, the mercury in the  stem remains at the height to which it was forced by the heat of the body  until it is shaken back into the bulb by taking hold of the upper portion  of the instrument and giving it a short, sharp swing. The normal  temperature of cattle varies from 100 deg. to 103 deg. F. In young animals it is  somewhat higher than in old. The thermometer is a very useful instrument  and frequently is the means by which disease is detected before the  appearance of any external sign.      [Illustration: PLATE I.

Simple probang, used to dislodge foreign bodies, like apples,  potatoes, eggs, etc., which have become fastened or stuck in the esophagus  or gullet.    Fig. 3. Grasping or forceps probang. This instrument, also intended to  remove obstructions from the gullet, has a spring forceps at one end in the  place of the cup-like arrangement at the end of the simple probang. The  forceps are closed while the probang is being introduced; their blades are  regulated by a screw in the handle of the instrument. This probang is used  to grasp and withdraw an article which may have lodged in the gullet and  can not be forced into the stomach by use of the simple probang.    Fig. 4. Wooden gag, used when the probang is to be passed. The gag is a  piece of wood which fits in the animal's mouth; a cord passes over the head  to hold it in place. The central opening in the wood is intended for the  passage of the probang.    Figs. 5_a_ and 5_b._ Trocar and cannula; 5_a_ shows the trocar covered by  the cannula; 5_b_, the cannula from which the trocar has been withdrawn.  This instrument is used when the rumen or first stomach becomes distended  with gas. The trocar covered by the cannula is forced into the rumen, the  trocar withdrawn, and the cannula allowed to remain until the gas has  escaped.    Fig. 6. Section at right angles through the abdominal wall, showing a  hernia or rupture. (Taken from D'Arboval. Dictionnaire de Medecine, de  Chirurgie de Hygiene): _a a_, The abdominal muscles cut across; _v_,  opening in the abdominal wall permitting the intestines _i i_ to pass  through and outward between the abdominal wall and the skin; _p p_,  peritoneum, or membrane lining the abdominal cavity, carried through the  opening _o_ by the loop of intestine and forming the sac S, the outer walls  of which are marked _b f b._    PLATE IV. Microscopic anatomy of the liver. The liver is composed of  innumerable small lobules, from 1/20 to 1/10 inch in diameter. The lobules  are held together by a small amount of fibrous tissue, in which the bile  ducts and larger blood vessels are lodged.    Fig. 1 Illustrates the structure of a lobule; _v v_, interlobular veins or  the veins between the lobules. These are branches of the portal vein, which  carries blood from the stomach and intestines to the liver; _c c_,  capillaries, or very fine blood vessels, extending as a very fine network  between the groups of liver cells from the interlobular vein to the center  of the lobule and emptying there into the intralobular vein to the center  of the lobule; _v c_, intralobular vein, or the vein within the lobule.  This vessel passes out of the lobule and there becomes the sublobular vein;  _v s_, sublobular vein. This joins other similar veins and helps to form  the hepatic vein, through which the blood leaves the liver; _d d_, the  position of the liver cells between the meshes of the capillaries; _A A_,  branches of the hepatic artery to the interlobular connective tissue and  the walls of the large veins and large bile ducts. These branches are seen  at _r r_ and form the vena vascularis; _v v_, vena vascularis; _i i_,  branches of the hepatic artery entering the substance of the lobule and  connecting with capillaries from the interlobular vein. The use of the  hepatic artery is to nourish the liver, while the other vessels carry blood  to be modified by the liver cells in certain important directions; _g_,  branches of the bile ducts, carrying bile from the various lobules into the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3032"],[0,"The Fathers of the Constitution: A Chronicle of the Establishment of the Union (#13)"],[1,"had passed resolutions  declaring that, in considering the condition of the whole country, what  particularly concerned them was the condition of trade. Paradoxical as  it may seem, the trade and commerce of the country were already on the  upward grade and prosperity was actually returning. But prosperity  is usually a process of slow growth and is seldom recognized by the  community at large until it is well established. Farsighted men forecast  the coming of good times in advance of the rest of the community, and  prosper accordingly. The majority of the people know that prosperity has  come only when it is unmistakably present, and some are not aware of it  until it has begun to go. If that be true in our day, much more was it  true in the eighteenth century, when means of communication were so poor  that it took days for a message to go from Boston to New York and  weeks for news to get from Boston to Charleston. It was a period of  adjustment, and as we look back after the event we can see that the  American people were adapting themselves with remarkable skill to the  new conditions. But that was not so evident to the men who were feeling  the pinch of hard times, and when all the attendant circumstances,  some of which have been described, are taken into account, it is not  surprising that commercial depression should be one of the strongest  influences in, and the immediate occasion of, bringing men to the point  of willingness to attempt some radical changes.    The fact needs to be reiterated that the people of the United States  were largely dependent upon agriculture and other forms of extractive  industry, and that markets for the disposal of their goods were an  absolute necessity. Some of the States, especially New England and  the Middle States, were interested in the carrying trade, but all were  concerned in obtaining markets. On account of jealousy interstate trade  continued a precarious existence and by no means sufficed to dispose of  the surplus products, so that foreign markets were necessary. The people  were especially concerned for the establishment of the old trade with  the West India Islands, which had been the mainstay of their prosperity  in colonial times; and after the British Government, in 1783, restricted  that trade to British vessels, many people in the United States were  attributing hard times to British malignancy. The only action which  seemed possible was to force Great Britain in particular, but other  foreign countries as well, to make such trade agreements as the  prosperity of the United States demanded. The only hope seemed to lie  in a commercial policy of reprisal which would force other countries  to open their markets to American goods. Retaliation was the dominating  idea in the foreign policy of the time. So in 1784 Congress made a new  recommendation to the States, prefacing it with an assertion of the  importance of commerce, saying: \"The fortune of every Citizen is  interested in the success thereof; for it is the constant source of  wealth and incentive to industry; and the value of our produce and our  land must ever rise or fall in proportion to the prosperous or adverse  state of trade.\"    And after declaring that Great Britain had \"adopted regulations  destructive of our commerce with her West India Islands,\" it was further  asserted: \"Unless the United States in Congress assembled shall be  vested with powers competent to the protection of commerce, they can  never command reciprocal advantages in trade.\" It was therefore  proposed to give to Congress for fifteen years the power to prohibit the  importation or exportation of goods at American ports except in vessels  owned by the people of the United States or by the subjects of foreign  governments having treaties of commerce with the United States. This  was simply a request for authorization to adopt navigation acts. But the  individual States were too much concerned with their own interests and  did not or would not appreciate the rights of the other States or the  interests of the Union as a whole. And so the commercial amendment of  1784 suffered the fate of all other amendments proposed to the Articles  of Confederation. In fact only two States accepted it.    It usually happens that some minor occurrence, almost unnoticed at the  time, leads directly to the most important consequences. And an incident  in domestic affairs started the chain of events in the United States  that ended in the reform of the Federal Government. The rivalry and  jealousy among the States had brought matters to such a pass that either  Congress must be vested with adequate powers or the Confederation must  collapse. But the Articles of Confederation provided no remedy, and it  had been found that amendments to that instrument could not be obtained.  It was necessary, therefore, to proceed in some extra-legal fashion.  The Articles of Confederation specifically forbade treaties or alliances  between the States unless approved by Congress. Yet Virginia and  Maryland, in 1785, had come to a working agreement regarding the use  of the Potomac River, which was the boundary line between them.  Commissioners representing both parties had met at Alexandria and soon  adjourned to Mount Vernon, where they not only reached an amicable  settlement of the immediate questions before them but also discussed the  larger subjects of duties and commercial matters in general. When  the Maryland legislature came to act on the report, it proposed that  Pennsylvania and Delaware should be invited to join with them in  formulating a common commercial policy. Virginia then went one step  farther and invited all the other States to send commissioners to a  general trade convention and later announced Annapolis as the place of  meeting and set the time for September, 1786.    This action was unconstitutional and was so recognized, for James  Madison notes that \"from the Legislative Journals of Virginia it  appears, that a vote to apply for a sanction of Congress was followed  by a vote against a communication of the Compact to Congress,\" and he  mentions other similar violations of the central authority. That this  did not attract more attention was probably due to the public interest  being absorbed just at that time by the paper money agitation. Then,  too, the men concerned seem to have been willing to avoid publicity.  Their purposes are well brought out in a letter of Monsieur Louis Otto,  French Charge d'Affaires, written on October 10, 1786, to the Comte de  Vergennes, Minister for Foreign Affairs, though their motives may be  somewhat misinterpreted.    \"Although there are no nobles in America, there is a class of men  denominated \"gentlemen,\" who, by reason of their wealth, their talents,  their education, their families, or the offices they hold, aspire to a  preeminence which the people refuse to grant them; and, although many of  these men have betrayed the interests of their order to gain popularity,  there reigns among them a connection so much the more intimate as they  almost all of them dread the efforts of the people to despoil them of  their possessions, and, moreover, they are creditors, and therefore  interested in strengthening the government, and watching over the  execution of the laws.    \"These men generally pay very heavy taxes, while the small proprietors  escape the vigilance of the collectors. The majority of them being  merchants, it is for their interest to establish the credit of the  United States in Europe on a solid foundation by the exact payment of  debts, and to grant to congress powers extensive enough to compel the  people to contribute for this purpose. The attempt, my lord, has been  vain, by pamphlets and other publications, to spread notions of justice  and integrity, and to deprive the people of a freedom which they have so  misused. By proposing a new organization of the federal government all  minds would have been revolted; circumstances ruinous to the commerce of  America have happily arisen to furnish the reformers with a pretext for  introducing innovations.    \"They represented to the people that the American name had become  opprobrious among all the nations of Europe; that the flag of the United  States was everywhere exposed to insults and annoyance; the husbandman,  no longer able to export his produce freely, would soon be reduced to  want; it was high time to retaliate, and to convince foreign powers that  the United States would not with impunity suffer such a violation of the  freedom of trade, but that strong measures could be taken only with  the consent of the thirteen states, and that congress, not having the  necessary powers, it was essential to form a general assembly instructed  to present to congress the plan for its adoption, and to point out the  means of carrying it into execution.    \"The people, generally discontented with the obstacles in the way of  commerce, and scarcely suspecting the secret motives of their opponents,  ardently embraced this measure, and appointed commissioners, who were to  assemble at Annapolis in the beginning of September.    \"The authors of this proposition had no hope, nor even desire, to see  the success of this assembly of commissioners, which was only intended  to prepare a question much more important than that of commerce. The  measures were so well taken that at the end of September no more than  five states were represented at Annapolis, and the commissioners from  the northern states tarried several days at New York in order to retard  their arrival.    \"The states which assembled, after having waited nearly three weeks,  separated under the pretext that they were not in sufficient numbers to  enter on business, and, to justify this dissolution, they addressed to  the different legislatures and to congress a report, the translation of  which I have the honor to enclose to you.\"*            * Quoted by Bancroft, \"History "]]]
