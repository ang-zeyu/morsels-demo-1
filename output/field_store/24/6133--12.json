Et caveant sibi Ballivus & Præpositus, nè aliquod instaurum  extra manerium vendatur, quin priùs per tenentes Domini, secundùm verum  valorem apprecietur; cujus sit publicus emptor, qui plus inde dare  voluerit, eo quod hujusmodiaveria non sunt catalla defuncti, seu de  parco Regis, vel præda.    _Ss. 15._ Item, diligenter eligantur bidentes in festo Sancti Michaëlis:  nam esto quod ad Pascham ad festumque Nativitatis Sancti Johannis, & in  principio mensis augusti sanæ permanserint; inter duo tamen festa beatæ  Mariæ in augusti septembrisque mensibus, ob malam custodiam in pastura  corruptibili, ac per commestum cujusdam nubis escaetæ, quæ tunc temporis  cadere contingit, vel per commestum albarum testudinum corrumpi poterunt  & infirmari.

Apros vel sues non teneat quis, nisi fuerit occasione  bonitatis suæ progeniei, sed suas faciat sues quodamodo castrari, ut  steriles efficiantur; bacones namque talium baconibus masculorum  æquivalebunt.    _Ss. 2._ Matrices, si quæ prægnantes remanserint, non permittat quivis  in hyeme perire, ne per asperitatem algoris sibi anticipentur suorum  tempora productionis porcellorum: ipse verò in tribus mensibus præcipuè  auxilio indiget, februario videlicet, martio & aprili, quæ ter in anno  debent porcellare, nisi mala custodia eas excuset, quibus etiam ac  porcis omnibus optimum est jacere in loco sicco longas matutinas. Si  autem glande, nucibus aut pessona valeant sustentari, bonum est porcorum  instaurum, dum inde boscus, mariscus, vel communia in foresta manerio  pertineat, ex quibus sumere poterint nutrimentum cum aliquo adjutorio  grangiarum. Et quo casu fiat porcheria in marisco vel bosco, in qua,  superveniente fortè gelu poterunt hospitari.    _Ss. 3._ Debiliores tamen & sues cum porcellaverint ad manerium  fugantur, & de exitibus grangiarum, durante hyemis asperitate,  nutriantur; qui cum fragilitatis compunctio transierit, statim  retornentur ad alios. Si autem boscus, mariscus, foresta, vel vastitas  manerio non pertineant, nec sit de quo sustentari poterunt, præterquam  de exitibus grangiarum, tunc porcos non expediet custodire, nisi tot  tantum quot ex stubula tempore autumnali cum aliquibus minutis  grangiarum exitibus poterunt confoveri.

Chapitre 81.    _DE TEMPORE AUTUMNALI._    _Ss. 1._ Non sufficit quòd semen magis projiciatur, nisi segetes cum  diligentia colligantur. Prospiciant igitur sibi Ballivus & Præpositus,  quòd ante tempus metendi mundentur segetes, quòdque cardines, parellæ, &  hujusmodi herbæ dampnosæ penitùs abolentur; hoc tamen fiat post festum  Nativitatis Sancti Johannis: nam si ante idem festum quis faceret hoc,  de uno stipite duæ pullulationes vel tres provenirent, & essent sic  dampnum duplicatum: faciant etiam ante dictum festum, si tempus  arriserit, prata falcari, dispargi, desiccari, co-adunari, & salvò  custodiri, priusquam subjungeretur imbribus pluviosis.    _Ss. 2._ Tempore autem metendi non sint servientes pigritiæ dediti, sed  manè faciat messor suos congregari messores, quos falces messi immittere  festinet, ac seriatim & continuè absque cursus velocitate ipsas meti  faciat, perspiciens nè subtus primum manipulum segetes prosternentur, ac  per invidiosam expeditionem omittantur insecatæ; imo quia vel purè  metientur, gavellæque seriatim supponentur, ut sic citiùs desiccentur,  ac commodè in minutis garbis æquèque colligantur; minuta namque garba  habilior est quàm magna ad carcandum, tassandum, & triturandum & congruo  tempore expectato in grangiis salvò cariantur & reponantur.    Chapitre 82.    _DE EXITIBUS GRANGIARUM._    _Ss. 1._ Priusquam hujusmodi blada tassentur lij garba ab omni genere  bladi in hostio grangiæ extrahatur, & obtenta sic de toto usufructu  manerii lij parte, per consequens scire poterit dequanto debet custos  residui respondere. Nec sustineatur, quod præpositus sit granatarius &  grangiarius simul; sed sit grangiarius Ballivus, vel ejus Substitutus,  qui bladum præposito liberet per mensuram rasam & non cumulatam; nec  sint diversæ mensuræ, sed una tantùm quæ sub sigillo Senescali sit bene  signata. Rasa dico, quia fraus citiùs fieri poterit in cumulata, eo quod  quatuor cumulatæ quintam ferè vel ampliùs continent de rasis, si mensura  lata fuerit; si minus lata in quinque continebuntur sex, ut si minus  lata in sex continentur septem: fiant ergo rasæ ut pote prædictum est.    _Ss. 2._ Si autem grangiarum exitus non nisi de semine triplicato  responderit Domino, inde nihil est lucraturus, nisi per bladi charam  venditionem: nam una acra pro frumento trinam exigit aruram præceptis  terris singulis annis seminatis, & valet arura xviij denarios.  Herciatura, j denarius, duo busselli frumenti pro semine xij denarios,  mundatura segetum ob messura v denarios & cariagium j denarium receptis  si quidem sex bussellis, ut tantum trina habeatur restitutio de exitibus  inde provenientibus de pretio trium solidorum, sed magis inde non  provenientibus, & misis deductis, tres obolos erit Dominus sic  amissurus. Abjectio verò bladi, ut crappæ hujusmodi quæ in anno  remanserint, recolligatur, ac potiùs trituretur & vendetur, purumque  puro re-admittatur. Insidianturque trituratores ac ventrices, ne  quicquam bladi furentur in suis _sotularibus_[A], cirotecis,  _alloveriis_[B], bursis, seu pontoneriis, vel sacculis, juxta grangiam  occultatis. Nullus Præpositus ultra unum annum remaneat irremotus, nisi  pro fideli ac optimo appruatore, sed cum in præpositura remanserit,  diligenter defectus videat in curia subortos, ut pote de domibus  detectis, muris fractis, fossatis obstructis, sepibus dirutis, carucis  ruptis, carectis disjunctis & fractis, ovilibus derelictis, & hujusmodi,  quibus cum celeritate manus adjutrices apponat, ne negligentia ejus  Domino sit dampnosa: quod enim hodiè posset de uno denario corrigi, in  fine fortè anni de xij denariis non poterit emendari. Ideòque melius  est in tempore occurrere, quàm post causam vulneratum causæ remedium  adhibere; prospiciat sibi tamen de warranto inde habendo, alioquin  voluntaria erit allocatio prædictorum, eo quod hujusmodi missas esse  falsas supponunt auditores compotorum; nec fient sepes de pomariis,  piris, cerisariis, vel prunariis, sed de salicibus & alba spina  construantur.

With the smaller kind of spaniels and the generality of petted animals,  the indications of the eye may be depended upon; but with the more robust  and less familiarized species it is safest to take some precaution, even,  while the sign of sagacity is exhibited. Certain dogs, those of coarse  breeds and large size, are exceedingly treacherous, and sometimes are not  safe even to their masters. Creatures of this kind are, however, usually  as devoid of courage as they are deficient of magnanimity; and by the  display of resolution are to be readily subdued.    When, however, really sick, there are few dogs which may not be  approached. Under such circumstances, the utmost gentleness should be  employed. The stranger should advance quietly, and not bustle rudely up to  the animal. He should speak to it in accents of commiseration, which will  be better comprehended than the majority of reasonable beings may be  willing to admit.    The hand after a little while should be quietly offered to the dog to  smell, and that ceremony being ended, the pulse may be taken, or any other  necessary observation made, without dread of danger. Every consideration,  however, ought to be given to the condition of the beast. No violence on  any account should be indulged; it is better to be ignorant of symptoms  than to aggravate the disorder by attempting to ascertain their existence.  If the brain should be affected, or the nervous system sympathetically  involved, silence is absolutely imperative. No chirping or loud talking  ought under such circumstances to be allowed, and the animal should not be  carried into the light for the purpose of inspecting it. The real  condition of the patient, and the extent or nature of its disease, will be  best discovered by silently watching the animal for some time, and  attentively noting those actions which rarely fail to point out the true  seat of the disorder. Consequently manual interference is the less needed,  and in numerous instances I have, when the creature has appeared to be  particularly sensitive to being handled, trusted to visible indications,  and done so with perfect success. The hand certainly can confirm the eye,  but the mind, properly directed, can often read sufficient without the  aid of a single sense.    Having made the foregoing remarks, which the intelligence of the reader  will readily enlarge, it will next be necessary to describe in what way  the dog should be examined. Simple as this operation may appear, it is one  which few persons properly comprehend; and as upon it everything depends,  it will not be out of place to devote a few lines to its explanation.    The dog, in the first place, should be permitted to run about, released  from every restraint, or only so far confined as is necessary to prevent  his escape from the limits of observation. No attempt should be made to  attract the animal's attention, but the practitioner, seating himself in  one corner, ought to be perfectly still and silent. The way in which the  creature moves; whether it roams about, stands motionless, appears  restless or indifferent, avoids the light, seems desirous of  companionship, or huddles itself into some place as far as possible  removed from inspection; whether it crouches down, curls itself round,  sits upon its haunches, turns round and round trying to bite its tail,  drags itself along the floor, or lies stretched out either upon its side  or belly; in what manner the head is carried, and to what part it is  directed; if any particular place is licked, bitten, or scratched; if  thirst is great, or the dog by scenting about shows an inclination for  food; the nature of the breathing, the expression of the countenance, the  appearance of the coat, and the general condition of the body, should all  be noted down. When such points have been observed, the animal is  addressed by name, and attempts may be made to approach and to caress it;  the way in which it responds, submits to, or resents such advances being  carefully remarked.    The dog may then be handled. The eyes and their membrane are inspected, to  see if the one be dull or moistened by any discharge, and if the other be  reddened, pallid, yellow, or discolored.    The ears are next felt around, their edges lifted to discover if any  blackened wax or soreness be present in their convolutions, and slightly  squeezed to ascertain if any crackling sensation is communicated to the  fingers, or sign of pain evinced by the animal.    The nose is now to be remarked. If it be moist or dry; and if dry, whether  it is at all encrusted. The back of the hand or side of the cheek should  be applied to the part to ascertain its temperature.    The lips should next be raised, and the state of their lining membrane,  with the condition of the teeth, observed.    The jaws should then be separated, that the tongue may be seen  sufficiently to note its color, and the breath smelt.    The hand should subsequently be passed over the head and along the back,  to feel the hair, and discover whether there exist any sore places or  tumors concealed beneath it. The coat may now be generally examined, to  find whether in any part the covering is thin or deficient. Its firmness  should afterwards be tried, and the itchiness of the skin tested by the  nails, as well as its thickness and pliancy ascertained between the  fingers.    The hand should also be applied to the throat, and carried along the  course of the windpipe, feeling for any swelling of the salivary glands,  or enlargement of the thyroid. It is next passed to the abdomen, and the  inferior part of the cavity is gently pressed upwards, to ascertain if the  rectus abdominis muscle be contracted, or the animal shows symptoms of  tenderness. The abdomen may subsequently be kneaded between the fingers.  The amount of fat should not be unnoticed, nor should the firmness of the  muscles pass unobserved.    When all this is accomplished, the dog is laid upon its side or back, and  the tail being elevated, the anus is inspected and felt, to see whether it  be inflamed or protruded, and to feel if it be indurated or thickened.    The feet are now taken up, and the length and shape of the nails, with the  condition of the dew claws, inspected, to see whether they are growing  into the flesh, or by their shortness indicate the animal has been  accustomed to healthful exercise. The pad and web also receive a glance.    If the animal be a male, the prepuce is first pressed and then withdrawn,  to perceive if any discharge be present, or if the lining membrane be  inflamed or ulcerated.    Should it be a bitch, the vulva are inspected, to observe if they are  moistened by any exudation, or if they are swollen and excited by the  touch. They are separated to observe the color of the lining membrane.    The mammae are then felt, to know if the animal has ever borne pups, or if  any of them are hardened. At the same time the parts are squeezed, to  discover whether or not they contain milk.    Such is a general description of the manner of proceeding, but there are  many possibilities which the above directions, lengthy and minute as they  may read, do not include. Such, for instance, as hernia, and disease of  the testicle or scrotum. All, however, it would not be necessary to  describe at length, and the foregoing instructions will lead the eye to  any extraordinary appearances should they exist. The experienced  practitioner probably will do less than is here set down, being educated  to a promptitude which enables him to leap as it were at once to those  parts which deserve his attention. For such the above is not intended; but  he who has not made the dog his special study, will certainly find his  advantage in going through the whole ceremony; nor will the most  experienced practitioner habitually neglect any portion of it, without  having cause to lament his inattention. To examine the dog properly, is  perhaps even more difficult than to perform the same office upon the  horse, and certainly it is a duty which there are few persons qualified to  discharge.    Having spoken of the proper manner of examining the animal, before I  proceed to describe its diseases, I shall touch upon some of those  matters which are essential to its health. It will, however, be understood  that I do not here pretend to treat of hounds, which for the most part are  well attended to, and fed, exercised, &c., according to the judgment of  the individual entrusted with the superintendence of the kennel. Little  probably could be written which would materially amend the condition of  these creatures; but petted and housed dogs are commonly treated after a  fashion with which judgment has nothing to do. Persons are indulgent to  their animals, and imagine that they are also kind, when too often they  oppose the dictates of their reason to gratify the weakness of their  momentary impulses. A little reflection will convince such people that  humanity does not consist in the yielding to every expression of desire.  The dog, in a state of nature, being carnivorous, and obliged to hunt for  its food, in all probability would not feed every day; certainly it would  seldom make more than one meal in twenty-four hours. When the prey was  caught, it would be torn to pieces, and with the flesh much earth would be  swallowed. The animal, however, is now to be regarded as subjected to man;  but while so viewing it, nothing will be lost by keeping in sight its  primitive habits.    The dog can fast for a great number of days. Abstinence for forty-eight  hours seldom injures it; but it is a practice which ought not to be too  frequently adopted, as by its repetition the digestion is weakened. One  meal, however, is sufficient, in every case, for the twenty-four hours.  Animals not worked, but kept as favourites, or allowed only to range at  pleasure, should not have any meat, nor"]]]
