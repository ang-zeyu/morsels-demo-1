Female society gives men a taste for cleanliness and elegance of person.  Our ancestors, who kept but little company with their women, were not  only slovenly in their dress, but had their countenances disfigured with  long beards. By female influence, however, beards were, in process of  time, mutilated down to mustaches. As the gentlemen found that the  ladies had no great relish for mustaches, which were the relics of a  beard, they cut and curled them into various fashions, to render them  more agreeable. At last, however, finding such labor vain, they gave  them up altogether. But as those of the three learned professions were  supposed to be endowed with, or at least to stand in need of, more  wisdom than other people, and as the longest beard had always been  deemed to sprout from the wisest chin, to supply this mark of  distinction, which they had lost, they contrived to smother their heads  in enormous quantities of frizzled hair, that they might bear greater  resemblance to an owl, the bird sacred to wisdom and Minerva.    To female society it has been objected by the learned and studious, that  it enervates the mind, and gives it such a turn for trifling, levity,  and dissipation, as renders it altogether unfit for that application  which is necessary in order to become eminent in any of the sciences. In  proof of this they allege, that the greatest philosophers seldom or  never were men who enjoyed, or were fit for, the company or conversation  of women. Sir Isaac Newton hardly ever conversed with any of the sex.  Bacon, Boyle, Des Cartes, and many others, conspicuous for their  learning and application, were but indifferent companions to the fair.    It is certain, indeed, that the youth who devotes his whole time and  attention to female conversation, and the little offices of gallantry,  never distinguishes himself in the literary world. But notwithstanding  this, without the fatigue and application of severe study, he often  obtains, by female interest, that which is denied to the merited  improvements acquired by the labor of many years.      MONASTIC LIFE.    The venerable _Bede_ has given us a very striking picture of Monastic  enormities, in his epistle to Egbert. From this we learn that many young  men who had no title to the monastic profession, got possession of  monasteries; where, instead of engaging in the defence of their country,  as their age and rank required, they indulged themselves in the most  dissolute indolence.    We learn from Dugdale, that in the reign of Henry the Second, the nuns  of Amsbury abbey in Wiltshire were expelled from that religious house on  account of their incontinence. And to exhibit in the most lively colors  the total corruption of monastic chastity, bishop Burnet informs us in  his \"History of the Reformation,\" that when the nunneries were visited  by the command of Henry the VIII. \"whole houses almost, were found whose  vows had been made in vain.\"    When we consider to what oppressive indolence, to what a variety of  wretchedness and guilt, the young and fair inhabitants of the cloister  were frequently betrayed, we ought to admire those benevolent authors  who, when the tide of religious prejudice ran very strong in favor of  monastic virginity, had spirit enough to oppose the torrent, and to  caution the devout and tender sex against so dangerous a profession. It  is in this point of view that the character of Erasmus appears with the  most amiable lustre; and his name ought to be eternally dear to the  female world in particular. Though his studies and constitution led him  almost to idolize those eloquent fathers of the church who have  magnified this kind of life, his good sense and his accurate survey of  the human race, enabled him to judge of the misery in which female youth  was continually involved by a precipitate choice of the veil. He knew  the successful arts by which the subtle and rapacious monks inveigled  young women of opulent families into the cloister; and he exerted his  lively and delicate wit in opposition to so pernicious an evil.    In those nations of Europe where nunneries still exist, how many lovely  victims are continually sacrificed to the avarice or absurd ambition of  inhuman parents! The misery of these victims has been painted with great  force by some benevolent writers of France.    In most of those pathetic histories that are founded on the abuse of  convents, the misery originates from the parent, and falls upon the  child. The reverse has sometime happened; and there are examples of  unhappy parents, who have been rendered miserable by the religious  perversity of a daughter. In the fourteenth volume of that very amusing  work, _Les Causes Celebres_, a work which is said to have been the  favorite reading of Voltaire, there is a striking history of a girl  under age, who was tempted by pious artifice to settle herself in a  convent, in express opposition to parental authority. Her parents, who  had in vain tried the most tender persuasion, endeavored at last to  redeem their lost child, by a legal process against the nunnery in which  she was imprisoned. The pleadings on this remarkable trial may, perhaps,  be justly reckoned amongst the finest pieces of eloquence that the  lawyers of France have produced. Monsieur Gillet, the advocate for the  parents, represented, in the boldest and most affecting language, the  extreme baseness of this religious seduction. His eloquence appeared to  have fixed the sentiments of the judges; but the cause of superstition  was pleaded by an advocate of equal power, and it finally prevailed. The  unfortunate parents of Maria Vernal (for this was the name of the  unfortunate girl) were condemned to resign her forever, and to make a  considerable payment to those artful devotees who had piously robbed  them of their child.    When we reflect on the various evils that have arisen in convents, we  have the strongest reason to rejoice and glory in that reformation by  which the nunneries of England were abolished. Yet it would not be  candid or just to consider all these as the mere harbors of  licentiousness; since we are told that, at the time of their  suppression, some of our religious houses were very honorably  distinguished by the purity of their inhabitants. \"The visitors,\" says  Bishop Burnet, \"interceded earnestly for one nunnery in Oxfordshire,  where there was great strictness of life, and to which most of the young  gentlewomen of the country were sent to be bred; so that the gentry of  the country desired the king would spare the house: yet all was  ineffectual.\"      DEGREES OF SENTIMENTAL ATTACHMENT AT DIFFERENT PERIODS.    In the earlier ages, sentiment in love does not appear to have been much  attended to. When Abraham sent his servant to court a bride for his son  Isaac, we do not so much as hear that Isaac was consulted on the matter:  nor is there even a suspicion, that he might refuse or dislike the wife  which his father had selected for him.    From the manner in which Rebecca was solicited, we learn, that women  were not then courted in person by the lover, but by a proxy, whom he,  or his parents, deputed in his stead. We likewise see, that this proxy  did not, as in modern times, endeavor to gain the affection of the lady  he was sent to, by enlarging on the personal properties, and mental  qualifications of the lover; but by the richness and magnificence of the  presents he made to her and her relations.    Presents have been, from the earliest ages, and are to this day, the  mode of transacting all kinds of business in the east. When a favor is  to be asked of a superior, one cannot hope to obtain it without a  present. Courtship, therefore, having been anciently transacted in this  manner, it is plain, that it was only considered in the same light as  any other negotiable business, and not as a matter of sentiment, and of  the heart.    In the courtship, however, or rather purchase of a wife by Jacob, we  meet with something like sentiment; for when he found that he was not  possessed of money or goods, equal to the price which was set upon her,  he not only condescended to purchase her by servitude, but even seemed  much disappointed when the tender-eyed Leah was faithlessly imposed upon  him instead of the beautiful Rachel.    The ancient Gauls, Germans, and neighboring nations of the North, had so  much veneration for the sex in general, that in courtship they behaved  with a spirit of gallantry, and showed a degree of sentiment, to which  _those_ who called them barbarians, never arrived. Not contented with  getting possession of the person of his mistress, a northern lover could  not be satisfied without the sincere affection of her heart; nor was his  mistress ever to be gained but by such methods as plainly indicated to  her the tenderest attachment from the most deserving man.    The women of Scandinavia were not to be courted but by the most  assiduous attendance, seconded by such warlike achievements as the  custom of the country had rendered necessary to make a man deserving of  his mistress. On these accounts, we frequently find a lover accosting  the object of his passion by a minute and circumstantial detail of his  exploits, and all his accomplishments. \"We fought with swords,\" says  King Regner, in a beautiful ode composed by himself, in memory of the  deeds of his former days, \"that day wherein I saw ten thousand of my  foes rolling in the dust, near a promontory of England. A dew of blood  distilled from our swords. The arrows which flew in search of the  helmets, bellowed through the air. The pleasure of that day was truly  exquisite.    \"We fought with swords. A young man should march early to the conflict  of arms. Man should attack man, or bravely resist him. In this hath  always consisted the nobility of the warrior. He who aspires to the love  of his mistress, ought to be dauntless in the clash of swords.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2612"],[0,"The History of England, from the Accession of James II — Volume 3 (#13)"],[1," of true integrity and public spirit. Yet even such a  man could not long live in such society without much risk that the  strictness of his principles would be relaxed, and the delicacy of  his sense of right and wrong impaired. It was unjust to blame a prince  surrounded by flatterers and traitors for wishing to keep near him four  or five servants whom he knew by proof to be faithful even to death.    Nor was this the only instance in which our ancestors were unjust to  him. They had expected that, as soon as so distinguished a soldier and  statesman was placed at the head of affairs, he would give some signal  proof, they scarcely knew what, of genius and vigour. Unhappily, during  the first months of his reign, almost every thing went wrong. His  subjects, bitterly disappointed, threw the blame on him, and began to  doubt whether he merited that reputation which he had won at his first  entrance into public life, and which the splendid success of his last  great enterprise had raised to the highest point. Had they been in  a temper to judge fairly, they would have perceived that for the  maladministration of which they with good reason complained he was not  responsible. He could as yet work only with the machinery which he had  found; and the machinery which he had found was all rust and rottenness.  From the time of the Restoration to the time of the Revolution, neglect  and fraud had been almost constantly impairing the efficiency of every  department of the government. Honours and public trusts, peerages,  baronetcies, regiments, frigates, embassies, governments,  commissionerships, leases of crown lands, contracts for clothing, for  provisions, for ammunition, pardons for murder, for robbery, for arson,  were sold at Whitehall scarcely less openly than asparagus at Covent  Garden or herrings at Billingsgate. Brokers had been incessantly plying  for custom in the purlieus of the court; and of these brokers the most  successful had been, in the days of Charles, the harlots, and in the  days of James, the priests. From the palace which was the chief seat of  this pestilence the taint had diffused itself through every office  and through every rank in every office, and had every where produced  feebleness and disorganization. So rapid was the progress of the decay  that, within eight years after the time when Oliver had been the umpire  of Europe, the roar of the guns of De Ruyter was heard in the Tower  of London. The vices which had brought that great humiliation on the  country had ever since been rooting themselves deeper and spreading  themselves wider. James had, to do him justice, corrected a few of the  gross abuses which disgraced the naval administration. Yet the naval  administration, in spite of his attempts to reform it, moved the  contempt of men who were acquainted with the dockyards of France and  Holland. The military administration was still worse. The courtiers  took bribes from the colonels; the colonels cheated the soldiers: the  commissaries sent in long bills for what had never been furnished: the  keepers of the arsenals sold the public stores and pocketed the price.  But these evils, though they had sprung into existence and grown  to maturity under the government of Charles and James, first made  themselves severely felt under the government of William. For Charles  and James were content to be the vassals and pensioners of a powerful  and ambitious neighbour: they submitted to his ascendency: they shunned  with pusillanimous caution whatever could give him offence; and thus,  at the cost of the independence and dignity of that ancient and glorious  crown which they unworthily wore, they avoided a conflict which would  instantly have shown how helpless, under their misrule, their once  formidable kingdom had become. Their ignominious policy it was neither  in William's power nor in his nature to follow. It was only by arms that  the liberty and religion of England could be protected against the most  formidable enemy that had threatened our island since the Hebrides were  strown with the wrecks of the Armada. The body politic, which, while it  remained in repose, had presented a superficial appearance of health  and vigour, was now under the necessity of straining every nerve in a  wrestle for life or death, and was immediately found to be unequal to  the exertion. The first efforts showed an utter relaxation of fibre, an  utter want of training. Those efforts were, with scarcely an exception,  failures; and every failure was popularly imputed, not to the rulers  whose mismanagement had produced the infirmities of the state, but to  the ruler in whose time the infirmities of the state became visible.    William might indeed, if he had been as absolute as Lewis, have used  such sharp remedies as would speedily have restored to the English  administration that firm tone which had been wanting since the death of  Oliver. But the instantaneous reform of inveterate abuses was a task far  beyond the powers of a prince strictly restrained by law, and restrained  still more strictly by the difficulties of his situation. [68]    Some of the most serious difficulties of his situation were caused by  the conduct of the ministers on whom, new as he was to the details of  English affairs, he was forced to rely for information about men and  things. There was indeed no want of ability among his chief counsellors:  but one half of their ability was employed in counteracting the other  half. Between the Lord President and the Lord Privy Seal there was an  inveterate enmity. [69] It had begun twelve years before when Danby was  Lord High Treasurer, a persecutor of nonconformists, an uncompromising  defender of prerogative, and when Halifax was rising to distinction as  one of the most eloquent leaders of the country party. In the reign of  James, the two statesmen had found themselves in opposition together;  and their common hostility to France and to Rome, to the High Commission  and to the dispensing power, had produced an apparent reconciliation;  but as soon as they were in office together the old antipathy revived.  The hatred which the Whig party felt towards them both ought, it should  seem, to have produced a close alliance between them: but in fact each  of them saw with complacency the danger which threatened the other.  Danby exerted himself to rally round him a strong phalanx of Tories.  Under the plea of ill health, he withdrew from court, seldom came to the  Council over which it was his duty to preside, passed much time in  the country, and took scarcely any part in public affairs except by  grumbling and sneering at all the acts of the government, and by doing  jobs and getting places for his personal retainers. [70] In consequence  of this defection, Halifax became prime minister, as far any minister  could, in that reign, be called prime minister. An immense load of  business fell on him; and that load he was unable to sustain. In wit and  eloquence, in amplitude of comprehension and subtlety of disquisition,  he had no equal among the statesmen of his time. But that very  fertility, that very acuteness, which gave a singular charm to his  conversation, to his oratory and to his writings, unfitted him for the  work of promptly deciding practical questions. He was slow from very  quickness. For he saw so many arguments for and against every possible  course that he was longer in making up his mind than a dull man would  have been. Instead of acquiescing in his first thoughts, he replied  on himself, rejoined on himself, and surrejoined on himself. Those who  heard him talk owned that he talked like an angel: but too often, when  he had exhausted all that could be said, and came to act, the time for  action was over.    Meanwhile the two Secretaries of State were constantly labouring to draw  their master in diametrically opposite directions. Every scheme,  every person, recommended by one of them was reprobated by the other.  Nottingham was never weary of repeating that the old Roundhead party,  the party which had taken the life of Charles the First and had plotted  against the life of Charles the Second, was in principle republican,  and that the Tories were the only true friends of monarchy. Shrewsbury  replied that the Tories might be friends of monarchy, but that they  regarded James as their monarch. Nottingham was always bringing to the  closet intelligence of the wild daydreams in which a few old eaters of  calf's head, the remains of the once formidable party of Bradshaw and  Ireton, still indulged at taverns in the city. Shrewsbury produced  ferocious lampoons which the Jacobites dropped every day in the  coffeehouses. \"Every Whig,\" said the Tory Secretary, \"is an enemy of  your Majesty's prerogative.\" \"Every Tory,\" said the Whig Secretary, \"is  an enemy of your Majesty's title.\" [71]    At the treasury there was a complication of jealousies and quarrels.  [72] Both the First Commissioner, Mordaunt, and the Chancellor of the  Exchequer, Delamere, were zealous Whigs but, though they held the same  political creed, their tempers differed widely. Mordaunt was volatile,  dissipated, and generous. The wits of that time laughed at the way in  which he flew about from Hampton Court to the Royal Exchange, and from  the Royal Exchange back to Hampton Court. How he found time for dress,  politics, lovemaking and balladmaking was a wonder. [73] Delamere was  gloomy and acrimonious, austere in his private morals, and punctual in  his devotions, but greedy of ignoble gain. The two principal ministers  of finance, therefore, became enemies, and agreed only in hating their  colleague Godolphin. What business had he at Whitehall in these days of  Protestant ascendency, he who had sate at the same board with Papists,  he who had never scrupled to attend Mary of Modena to the idolatrous  worship of the Mass? The most provoking circumstance was that Godolphin,  though his name stood"]]]
