If this strange and novel dye  should ever take its place among the vagaries of fashion, the shopkeepers  could find a familiar French name, as the word _chenille_, applied to  another commodity, means simply \"caterpillar,\" so \"_chenille green_\" would  be the phrase for the colour afforded by smashed caterpillars.    The _chrysalis_ (Plate I. fig. 15) may be found almost anywhere, laid up  under ledges of garden walls, doorway, or any convenient projection, not  too far from the creature's food. Wanting an individual just now, to sit  for his portrait, I had only to step out of my door, and within a hundred  yards espied a candidate for the distinction, ready to hand, under the  coping-stone of a gate-post.    A _female_ specimen of the butterfly is figured on Plate IV. fig. 2. The  _male_ may be readily distinguished by the _absence of the black spots and  dashes on the upper side of the front wings_.    The winged insect may be seen throughout the warm season from April to  August.           *       *       *       *       *      {84}    THE SMALL GARDEN WHITE. (_Pieris Rapae._)    (Plate IV. fig. 3.)    Outwardly resembling the last in almost every respect but that of its  inferior size, this species shares the gardener's malediction with its  larger, but perhaps less destructive, relative; for the caterpillar of  _Rapae_, though smaller, bores into the very heart of the cabbage, instead  of being content with the less valuable outer leaves, as _Brassicae_ is.  From this pernicious habit the French call this grub the _ver du coeur_.    The colour of this _caterpillar_ is pale green, with a yellow line along  the back, and a dotted one of the same colour on each side.    The _chrysalis_ is nearly like that of the last in shape, but of course  smaller, and is of a more uniform brownish or yellowish tint.    [Illustration: X.]    {85} This butterfly occasionally multiplies immensely, and is given to  migrating in vast armies to distant settlements, sometimes crossing the sea  to effect this purpose. Here is an extract from a Kentish newspaper,  describing an occurrence of this phenomenon:--    \"One of the largest flights of butterflies ever seen in this country,  crossed the Channel from France to England on Sunday last. Such was the  density and extent of the cloud formed by the living mass, that it  completely obscured the sun from the people on board our Continental  steamers, on their passage, for many hundreds of yards, while the insects  strewed the decks in all directions. The flight reached England about  twelve o'clock at noon, and dispersed themselves inland and along shore,  darkening the air as they went. During the sea-passage of the butterflies,  the weather was calm and sunny, with scarce a puff of wind stirring; but an  hour or so after they reached _terra firma_, it came on to blow great guns  from the S. W., the direction whence the insects came.\"    A contemporary account states that these were the small white butterflies  (_Pieris Rapae_).    The smaller butterfly with more dusky markings, formerly known as _P.  Metra_, has been recently proved to be merely a variety of _Rapae_, a Mr.  J. F. Dawson having reared a brood of caterpillars all _exactly similar_ in  appearance, which eventually produced every variety of _P. Rapae_ and _P.  Metra_.    Mr. Curtis, in his \"Farm Insects,\" mentions the capture, near Oldham in  Lancashire, of a male specimen, which had all the wings of a _bright  yellow_ colour.    Most juvenile butterfly hunters, unblest by scientific knowledge of insect  life, imagine that this and the last owe their difference in size simply to  their being old and young individuals of the same name; forgetting--or,  rather, never having heard--that butterflies never grow in the slightest  degree after once getting their winged form; only as caterpillars do they  grow. {86}    The male is distinguished from the female by having only _one round black  spot_, or sometimes none, on each _upper_ wing, whilst the female is  spotted as in the engraving. The under side of the hind wings is dull  yellow, lightly powdered with black scales.    The _butterfly_ is seen during nearly the whole of the summer, and is found  almost everywhere.           *       *       *       *       *    THE GREEN-VEINED WHITE BUTTERFLY. (_Pieris Napi._)    (Plate IV. fig. 4.)    Is so called from the greenish tint that _often_ borders the veins or  nervures on the _under_ side of the _hind_ wing; but the name is _not  always_ an appropriate one, for a large proportion of the specimens met  with have the veinings grey, and not at all green; but the fact is, that  the ground colour varies greatly, from creamy white to full buff, or bright  clear yellow; in the latter case it is, that the minute black scales which  border the course of the nervures, covering over the yellow, produce a  grey-green effect on the eye.    The size also is very variable. I have a specimen that expands two inches  and two lines across, from tip to tip, and have seen another not larger  than a small Copper butterfly--little more than one inch from tip {87} to  tip. The intensity of the dark markings, on both the upper and under sides,  is also subject to much variation.    But, under all these circumstances, the presence of dark cloudy veins on  the under side--appearing, but less distinctly, on the upper side--will at  once distinguish it from the last species, the only one with which it can  possibly be confounded.    The _male_ has only _one round spot_ on the _front_ wings; the _female_  being marked as in the plate.    Both in woods and cultivated grounds we meet with this butterfly commonly  enough, most abundantly in May and July, though it may be found from April  to August.    The _caterpillar_ feeds on the same tribe of plants as the two last, but is  supposed to be especially attached to the Rape (_Brassica Napus_), whence  its specific name. Its colour is green, with yellow spots round each  spiracle, which is itself tinged with red.    Two varieties of this were formerly ranked as distinct species, under the  name of _P. Sabellicae_ and _P. Napae_.           *       *       *       *       *    {88}    THE BATH WHITE. (_Pieris Daplidice._)    (Plate IV. fig. 5, Female.)    Of all the members of this white-winged genus that inhabit Britain, this is  at the same time the most beautiful and the rarest. The capture of a Bath  White is an entomological \"event,\" and the day thereof is a red-letter day  in the fortunate captor's life.    On the opposite coast of France, however, and generally on the Continent,  far from being a rarity, this is one of the commonest butterflies--a fact  difficult for an English collector, removed by only a few miles of sea, to  realise, or reconcile with the _extravagant_ value and importance attached  to a true \"British specimen.\"    The remark made under the head of the Black-veined White, as to that  eluding the net of the novice, by its resemblance to a common kind, will  apply with still greater force to this one; for I suppose there are few  even of the tolerably experienced \"hands\" who could tell this from the two  last described insects, at a short distance. One curious circumstance  bearing on this is, that a large per centage of the Bath White captures in  this country have been made by juvenile beginners, who hunt and catch  _everything_ they see, Common Whites and all. {89}    This fact should encourage the collector, especially when at work on the  south-east coast, to net all the middle-sized Whites that come within  reasonable distance--of course letting them off again, if they are not of  the right sort.    The wing markings on both the upper and under sides are, though simple,  extremely elegant and chaste. The _female_, which is the sex figured, has  the upper wings beautifully spotted with black. The hind wings are bordered  with a _row of black spots_, and clouded towards the centre with a faint  tint of the same.    The male is distinguished by the absence of the black spot nearest to the  lower margin of the front wing, and of the black marginal spots and grey  clouding of the hind wings. The markings of the under surface, however,  show through their substance rather plainly.    In both sexes, the ground colour of the wings is milk-white. But the chief  decoration is reserved for the under surface, which is chequered, in a  manner not easily described, with a soft but rich green tint upon white,  relieved here and there by a few black touches.    We are informed by Lewin, that it was named the Bath White from a piece of  needlework executed at Bath, by a young lady, from a specimen of this  insect, said to have been taken near that city. But the south-eastern  corner of England, and more especially on the coast, seems to be the  head-quarters of this valued fly,--lending probability to the supposition  entertained {90} by many, that a large proportion of those taken here have  migrated or been blown across the Channel; though I believe it sometimes  breeds here, and that the caterpillars have, on one or two occasions, been  found in this country.    The butterfly has been taken several times at Dover, Margate, and other  places on the Kentish coast; at Lewes; Whittlesea Mere, Cambridge;  Worcester, and near Bristol.    The _caterpillar_, which is to be found in June and September, is bluish  with black spots, a pale yellow line on each side, and two of the same  colour on the back. M. Le Plastrier reared a number of them, feeding them  on the leaves of the Wild Mignonette (_Reseda lutea_). It also feeds on  Weld (_Reseda Luteola_).    The _chrysalis_ very much resembles that of the Small Garden White, and is  totally unlike that of the next, the Orange-Tip, with which it has been by  some entomologist united into another genus "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33874"],[0,"Wild Bees, Wasps and Ants and Other Stinging Insects (#13)"],[1,"of an insect directly. The late Mr. F. Smith, in his day our leading  authority, the Rev. F. D. Morice, than whom no one has probably worked the  neighbourhood more thoroughly, Mr. T. R. Billups, Mr. E. B. Nevinson, and  the late Mr. A. Beaumont, have all been over the ground again and again,  and yet only these two _Dufoureas_! and these taken four miles apart. Here  again is a problem which is very perplexing! What part in nature does this  little rarity play? No doubt like everything else it has its duties, and  its corner to fill, but beyond that one can suggest nothing.    Other bees are often exceedingly abundant in one season and very rare the  next, or they will entirely desert a locality where they have been  abundant, and move somewhere else--the occasional scarceness is due  probably to continued wet weather, which often appears to kill the larvae.  Cold winters seem to have no injurious effect, although at one time they  were thought to determine the scarcity or otherwise of the bees of the  following summer. It has, I think, been clearly shown that larvae can stand  almost any amount of cold, although they succumb to {109} the effects of  mildew produced by wet, but there is often no apparent reason why a well  established colony should migrate to quite new pastures. Sometimes the  proximity of new buildings or the digging up of ground may disturb them,  but I know of colonies that have gone from where I knew them a  comparatively few years ago, and where I can detect no change likely to  have affected them. On the other hand there are colonies which one has  known all one's life and which still go on as strongly or more strongly  than ever--the case quoted under _Anthophora_, p. 63, shows what  persistence there can be in some.           *       *       *       *       *    {110}    ON BEES' WINGS    The Bees and the other stinging groups have four wings like all the  _Hymenoptera_. These wings are almost always clear and transparent, at any  rate amongst the British species, there being only one exception which I  can call to mind in the female of the cuckoo of our large red-tailed  humble-bee, which has the wings blackish; also they are never spotted, as  in some flies. The hind or lower wings unite with the upper by a series of  very beautiful hooks which extend along their upper margin and fix on to  the posterior edge of the front wing, which is folded back on itself so as  to receive them; in flight the two wings are united, but when at rest they  separate; these hooks are beautiful objects under a microscope; their  numbers vary; and in some cases this variation is useful in distinguishing  closely allied species from one another. The hum of a bee is caused, to a  great extent, by {111} the vibration of the wings, but it has been shown  that a loud buzzing noise can be emitted by bees which have lost their  wings; this proceeds from the spiracles or holes in the outer covering of  the creature through which it breathes. It is therefore not always easy to  say how much of the hum is caused by wing vibration and how much by the  action of the spiracles. Some, in fact most, of our solitary bees are  almost silent in flight, and their note can be heard only when large  numbers are flying together; others have a very peculiar shrill hum, by  which even the species can almost be recognized. In bright, hot, sunny  weather their flight is more rapid and their note attains a higher pitch.  The bees with the highest pitched hum with which I am acquainted are the  two smaller species of _Anthophora_ and _Saropoda bimaculata_.    In early spring, when it is hot in the sunshine and cold when a cloud  covers the sun, it is no unusual thing to see a bee drop to the ground. The  cold seems to paralyze altogether their powers of flight. When at rest a  bee folds its wings along the sides of its back, but only in the wasp tribe  is there the arrangement for them to be {112} folded longitudinally. The  shape of the wings varies very little, but the arrangement and number of  their cells vary considerably. There are some very interesting genera in  which the neuration of some of the cells is so slightly indicated that they  are hardly visible, and can be seen only when the wing is held in certain  lights; these faintly indicated cells are nearly always those towards the  apex of the wing, the neuration of the basal part of the wing being as  strong as in the other genera. There are a few moths in this country which  very much resemble, both in the colour of their bodies and their clear  wings, the wasp tribe, but they may be known by the brown band of scales at  the apex of the wings and also by the absence of the narrow waist, which  exists in all the stinging tribes. The only wingless forms which we know  are to be found amongst the ants and the fossors, and as a rule are  females, but in a few cases in the ants, and in some foreign species of the  genus _Mutilla_, the male is apterous also.           *       *       *       *       *    {113}    ON BREEDING ACULEATES, ETC.    Any one who wishes to study the life-histories of these insects, and has  leisure to do so, can easily obtain various larvae by digging for them in  suitable places. If, for instance, during the summer, bees, etc., have been  noticed entering holes in a certain bank or sandy spot, their larvae or  nymphs can be got in the autumn by digging down for about a foot in the  direction of the holes, and if they be brought home and put into glass-top  boxes they will generally emerge at their right time without giving any  further trouble; it must, however, be remembered that the grubs are very  soft and tender skinned, and it is better to avoid handling them if  possible; they should be moved with a small soft camel-hair pencil, and it  is well to put something soft at the bottom of the box so that if they fall  in they will not be damaged. If the wood-boring {114} species are being  collected, care must of course be taken in splitting the wood; most of  these make a pupa case over themselves, and are in that respect easier to  deal with. A label should be put in each box to show where the larvae,  etc., were found. An old rotten stump of a tree will often produce a good  number of species. Then there are the bramble-stem borers; these can be  left in the stems. I have generally found it convenient, after arriving  home, to split the stems down, to see if there are any living creatures in  them, and, if there are, to close them up again, and, tie a little very  fine net or gauze bag over the top of each stem; in this way one can find  out exactly what insects come from what stem, and determine the cuckoos (if  any) which belong to each. As the season advances towards May, it is well  to give all the larvae, etc., an occasional glimpse of the sun; they should  not be left in the sun long enough for them to get dried up too much, but  the sun is a very important factor in tempting them to emerge; naked larvae  and nymphs, in glass-top boxes, should be treated very carefully in this  respect, as they are deprived of their {115} natural surroundings, in which  the actual sunshine would never reach them--it would be better to place  them in a sunny room, screened off from the actual rays of the sun, so that  its warmth only would be felt. If they do not emerge the first year, it  should not be taken for granted that they are dead, as very likely they  will appear in the following spring. I have bred leaf-cutting bees several  times with great success, and others I know have been successful with many  species. The fear is to get them dried up too much; it is therefore not  desirable to keep them in a very hot room. When first the insects emerge,  their hairs are often more or less matted together, and they should be put  in the sun in a larger box, so that they can crawl about and clean  themselves; portions also of the skin in which they have been enveloped  frequently adhere to them for some little time, but as a rule, unless the  creature be too weak, these are very soon cleaned off. Breeding is a  fascinating amusement, but it requires a great deal of attention when the  emerging season begins, as the boxes want constant watching, or the insects  will emerge unnoticed, and, if not given proper {116} air and sunshine, may  die without cleaning themselves properly.    If it is desired to preserve the specimens, they should be killed either  with cyanide of potassium, ether, or chloroform. If the first of these  agents is used, a piece of about the size of a small hazel nut should be  put at the bottom of a bottle (for collecting purposes, an ordinary  \"Coleoptera bottle\", which can be obtained from any naturalist's shop, is  the most convenient) and should be kept down by a wad of blotting paper,  well pressed down upon it; this prevents the cyanide, as it liquifies, from  wetting the hairs, etc., of the insects. Over this a piece of white paper  should be placed; this will get stained at once when there is much damp,  and should then be changed. The objections to cyanide are its very  poisonous nature, and the stiffness which is caused by its use to the  specimens killed by it, and also its tendency to turn yellow colours red. I  always use it myself as I think it is preferable to the other insecticides,  notwithstanding its demerits, but then I do not extend the legs and wings  of my specimens, but simply leave them in whatever position they happen to  {117} die. Ether is a very favourite method of killing with many; a few  drops in a bottle with some paper in it is sufficient to last for some  hours; it however soon evaporates in hot weather, and it is necessary to  carry a small phial of it in one's pocket to replenish the supply when  exhausted; this makes one smell of ether perpetually, which is more than I  can stand. But the insects killed in this way are beautifully supple, and,  for those who wish to set their captures as they"]]]
