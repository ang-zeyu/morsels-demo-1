[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35409"],[0,"Beauty: Illustrated Chiefly (#13)"],[1,"by Burke, who observes: \"It is known that the  taste (whatever it is) is improved exactly as we improve our knowledge, by  a steady attention to our object, and by frequent exercise.    \"To illustrate this--(that there is a difference, not in the causes, nor  in the manner of men's being affected, but in the degree, owing to natural  sensibility, or greater attention to the object)--to illustrate this by  the procedure of the senses in which the same difference is found, let us  suppose a very smooth marble-table to be set before two men; they both  perceive it to be smooth, and they are both pleased with it because of  this quality. So far they agree.    \"But suppose another, and after that another table, the latter still  smoother than the former, to be set before them. It is now very probable  that these men, who are so agreed upon what is smooth, and in the pleasure  thence, will disagree when they come to settle which table has the  advantage in point of polish.... Nor is it easy, when such a difference  arises, to settle the point, if the excess or diminution be not glaring.    \"In these nice cases, supposing the acuteness of the sense equal, the  greater attention and habit in such things will have the advantage. In the  question about the tables, the marble-polisher will unquestionably  determine the most accurately.    \"In the imagination, beside the pain or pleasure arising from the  properties of the natural object, a pleasure is perceived from the  resemblance which the imitation has to the original.    \"All men are nearly equal in this point, as far as their knowledge of the  things represented or compared extends.    \"The principle of this knowledge is very much accidental, as it depends  upon experience and observation, and not on the strength or weakness of  any natural faculty; and it is from this difference in knowledge that what  we commonly, though with no great exactness, call a difference in taste,  proceeds.    \"A man to whom sculpture is new sees a barber's block, or some ordinary  piece of statuary; he is immediately struck and pleased, because he sees  something like a human figure; and entirely taken up with this likeness,  he does not at all attend to its defects. No person, I believe, at the  first time of seeing a piece of imitation, ever did. Some time after, we  suppose that this novice lights upon a more artificial work of the same  nature; he begins to look with contempt on what he admired at first; not  that he admired it even then for its unlikeness to a man, but for that  general though inaccurate resemblance which it bore to the human figure.  What he admired at different times in these so different figures, is  strictly the same; and though his knowledge is improved, his taste is not  altered. Hitherto his mistake was from a want of knowledge in art, and  this arose from his inexperience; but he may be still deficient, from a  want of knowledge in nature. For it is possible that the man in question  may stop here, and that the masterpiece of a great hand may please him no  more than the middling performance of a vulgar artist; and this not for  want of better or higher relish, but because all men do not observe with  sufficient accuracy on the human figure, to enable them to judge properly  of an imitation of it.\"    On other points, Hume makes the following observations:--    \"Without being frequently obliged to form _comparisons_ between the  several species and degrees of excellence, and estimating their proportion  to each other ... a man is indeed totally unqualified to pronounce an  opinion with regard to any object presented to him. By comparison alone,  we fix the epithets of praise or blame, and learn how to assign the due  degree of each.    \"But to enable a critic more fully to execute this undertaking, he must  preserve his mind free from all _prejudice_ and allow nothing to enter  into his consideration, but the very object which is submitted to his  examination.    \"It is well known, that, in all questions submitted to the understanding,  prejudice is destructive of sound judgment, and perverts all operations of  the intellectual faculties: it is no less contrary to good taste; nor has  it less influence to corrupt our sentiments of beauty. It belongs to _good  sense_ to check its influence in both cases; and in this respect, as well  as in many others, reason, if not an essential part of taste, is at least  requisite to the operations of this latter faculty. In all the nobler  productions of genius, there is a mutual relation and correspondence of  parts; nor can either the beauties or blemishes be perceived by him whose  thought is not capacious enough to comprehend all those parts, and compare  them with each other, in order to perceive the consistence and uniformity  of the whole. Every work of art has also a certain end or purpose for  which it is calculated; and is to be deemed more or less perfect, as it is  more or less fitted to attain this end.\"    To a repetition of this, Burke adds some useful remarks:--    \"As many of the works of imagination are not confined to representation of  sensible objects, nor to efforts upon the passions, but extend themselves  to the manners, the characters, the actions, and designs of men, their  relations, their virtues and vices, they come within the province of the  judgment, which is improved by attention and by the habit of reasoning.    \"The cause of a wrong taste is a defect of judgment. And this may arise  from a natural weakness of understanding (in whatever the strength of  that faculty may consist), or which is much more commonly the case, it  may arise from a want of proper and well-directed exercise, which alone  can make it strong and ready. Beside that ignorance, inattention,  prejudice, rashness, levity, obstinacy, in short, all those passions, and  all those vices which pervert the judgment in other matters, prejudice it  no less in this its more refined and elegant province. These causes  produce different opinions upon everything which is an object of the  understanding, without inducing us to suppose, that there are no settled  principles of reason.    \"A rectitude of judgment in the arts, which may be called a good taste,  does in a great measure depend upon sensibility; because, if the mind has  no bent to the pleasures of the imagination, it will never apply itself  sufficiently to works of that species to acquire a competent knowledge in  them. But though a degree of sensibility is requisite to form a good  judgment, yet a good judgment does not necessarily arise from a quick  sensibility of pleasure; it frequently happens that a very poor judge,  merely by force of a greater complexional sensibility, is more affected by  a poor piece, than the best judge by the most perfect; for as everything  new, extraordinary, grand, or passionate, is well calculated to affect  such a person, and that the faults do not affect him, his pleasure is more  pure and unmixed.    \"In the morning of our days, when the senses are unworn and tender, when  the whole man is awake in every part, and the gloss of novelty fresh upon  all the objects that surround us, how lively at that time are our  sensations, but how false and inaccurate the judgments we form of things!    \"Every trivial cause of pleasure is apt to affect the man of too sanguine  a complexion: his appetite is to keen to suffer his taste to be  delicate.... One of this character can never be a refined judge; never  what the comic poet calls '_elegans formarum spectator_.'    \"The rude hearer is affected by the principles which operate in these arts  even in their rudest condition; and he is not skilful enough to perceive  the defects. But as arts advance toward their perfection, the science of  criticism advances with equal pace, and the pleasure of judges is  frequently interrupted by the faults which are discovered in the most  finished compositions.\"    The chief idea above expressed, is again repeated by Sir J. Reynolds, who  says: \"The principles of these (the imagination and the passions) are as  invariable as the former (the senses), and are to be known and reasoned  upon in the same manner, by an appeal to _common sense_ deciding upon the  common feelings of mankind.\"    These views are thus summed by Hume: \"The organs of internal sensation are  seldom so perfect as to allow the general principles their full play, and  produce a feeling correspondent to those principles. They either labor  under some defect, or are vitiated by some disorder; and by that means,  excite a sentiment, which may be pronounced erroneous. When the critic has  no delicacy, he judges without any distinction, and is only affected by  the grosser and more palpable qualities of the object: the finer touches  pass unnoticed and disregarded. Where he is not aided by practice, his  verdict is attended with confusion and hesitation. Where no comparison has  been employed, the most frivolous beauties, such as rather merit the name  of defects, are the object of his admiration. Where he lies under the  influence of prejudice, all his natural sentiments are perverted. Where  good sense is wanting, he is not qualified to discern the beauties of  design and reasoning, which are the highest and most excellent. Under some  or other of these imperfections, the generality of men labor; and hence, a  true judge in the finer arts is observed, even during the most polished  ages, to be so rare a character: strong sense, united to delicate  sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and cleared of  all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable character; and  the joint verdict of such, wherever they are to be found, is the true  standard of taste and beauty.\"    Taking the principal ideas above, Burke also concludes: \"On the whole it  appears to me, that what is called taste, in its most general acceptation,  is not a simple idea, but is partly made up of a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],[0,"A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#13)"],[1,"barely visible, but in others it is large and distinct.  In two specimens the ventrolateral glands are weakly developed; in the  others the glands are well developed and orange-tan. The white anal  stripe varies from a thin line to a series of white flecks. Dark brown  or black flecks are present on the throat, chest, and flanks of all  specimens. In some the flecks are small and widely scattered; in  others the flecks are larger and more numerous. All specimens were  pale green above when calling at night; later they changed to dull  green with darker green reticulations. The flash-colors on the thighs  and in the groin vary from red to orange-red or brownish red.    _Description of tadpole._--The following description is based on KU  71716 from Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca, Mexico (Figs. 5C and 6G). Hind limbs  small; total length, 39.6 mm.; body length, 11.8 mm.; body  length/total length, 29.8 per cent. Body moderately depressed, only  slightly wider than deep, in dorsal profile ovoid, widest just  posterior to eyes; in lateral profile snout rounded; mouth directed  ventrally; eyes small, directed dorsolaterally; nostrils barely  protuberant, directed anteriorly, somewhat closer to eye than snout;  spiracle sinistral and posteroventrad to eye; anal tube dextral. Tail  long and slender; caudal fin low and rounded posteriorly; depth of  caudal musculature about one-half greatest depth of caudal fin;  musculature not extending to tip of tail.    Mouth large; thin fleshy lips greatly expanded and forming large  funnel-shaped disc; width of mouth about two-thirds greatest width of  body; outer edge of lips having one row of small papillae; inner  surface of mouth smooth; scattered large papillae forming one nearly  complete row around teeth; other papillae laterally; one large papilla  just above each end of first lower tooth-row; beaks moderately  developed bearing long, pointed denticulations; no lateral projections  on upper beak; tooth-rows 3/3, all short; second and third upper rows  subequal in length; first upper row shorter; first lower row equal in  length to second and third upper rows; second lower row slightly  shorter; third lower row shortest.    Body creamy gray with dark brown flecks above and below; mouth colored  like body; caudal musculature creamy tan; caudal fin transparent; dark  brown streak on anterior third of caudal musculature; rest of tail and  all of caudal fin, except anterior two-thirds of ventral fin, heavily  flecked with brown; iris silvery bronze color in life.    _Variation._--The only other known tadpole, which was collected with  the individual described above, differs in having only two upper  tooth-rows. The first upper tooth-row seems not to have developed.    _Comparisons._--From _P. schmidtorum chamulae_ and _P. s.  schmidtorum_, _P. ignicolor_ differs as follows: Tympanum smaller;  snout more nearly square; less webbing on toes; internarial region  flat instead of depressed; white lateral stripes lacking.    _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ and several small and moderate sized hylids are  sympatric. From _P. ignicolor_ these hylids can be distinguished as  follows: _Hyla dendroscarta_ has a round snout and yellow dorsum;  _Hyla erythromma_ has a round snout, green dorsum, white flanks, and a  red eye; _Hyla hazelae_ has a tarsal fold, green dorsum, and a black  line on the canthus; and _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_ has a tarsal  fold, brown dorsum, black and white flanks, and horny nuptial spines  in breeding males.    _Life History._--At Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca, males were calling on  vegetation above small streams on March 30, 1959, and on June 28,  1962; males were found on vegetation overhanging a stream 6 kilometers  south of Vista Hermosa on June 27 and July 3, 1962. The call consists  of a series of short notes, three to thirteen notes per series,  sounding like \"raa-raa-raa.\" The duration of each note is about .08 of  a second and has a rate of 123 to 129 pulses per second. The dominant  frequency of notes in short series is about 2100 cycles per second,  whereas the dominant frequency of notes in long series is about 3150  cycles per second (Pl. 11E).    On June 28, 1962, two tadpoles of this species were found in a quiet  pool in a spring-fed rivulet at Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca. Females are  unknown.    _Remarks._--The absence of a tarsal fold and of nuptial spines in  breeding males, the nature of the breeding call, and the form of  tadpole are characters that place _Ptychohyla ignicolor_ in the _P.  schmidtorum_-group.    _Distribution._--This species is known from only two localities at  elevations of 1500 and 1850 meters in the cloud forest on the northern  (Atlantic) slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental in northern Oaxaca.    _Specimens examined._--MEXICO: _Oaxaca: Vista Hermosa_, KU 71334,  71716 (tadpoles), UMMZ 119602; 6 km. S of Vista Hermosa, KU 71335-42,  71343 (skeleton), UMMZ 119603, 123327 (2).                                 DISTRIBUTION AND ECOLOGY                    Geographic Distribution of the Species      The distribution of species of _Ptychohyla_ reflects the distribution  of cloud forest in southern Mexico and northern Central America.  The frogs are restricted to mountainous areas, usually at elevations  higher than 1000 meters above sea level. _Ptychohyla_ does not range  to great heights in the mountains, where west of the Isthmus of  Tehuantepec the mountain streams are inhabited by frogs of the  _Hyla bistincta_ group, and in Chiapas and Guatemala by species of  _Plectrohyla_.    Frogs of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group have a greater combined  geographic range than the species comprising the _Ptychohyla  schmidtorum_ group (Fig. 7). No two species in the same group  are sympatric, but members of different groups are sympatric in at  least parts of their ranges. Apparently _P. leonhardschultzei_ ranges  around the southern edge of the Mexican Highlands, where the  species occurs on both Atlantic and Pacific slopes; as can be seen  from the distribution map, there are many gaps in the known range  of this species. The range of _P. euthysanota euthysanota_ is along  the Pacific slopes of the Sierra Madre in Chiapas, Guatemala, and  El Salvador, whereas that of _P. euthysanota macrotympanum_ is  along the southern interior slopes of the Central Highlands of  Chiapas and the Sierra de Cuchumatanes in Guatemala. _Ptychohyla  spinipollex_ occurs on the wet Atlantic slopes of the Guatemalan and  Honduranean Highlands; the range of the species in Honduras is  poorly known.        [Illustration: FIG. 7. Map showing locality records for the species          and subspecies of _Ptychohyla_.]      The frogs of the _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ group have more restricted  geographic ranges than members of the former group. _Ptychohyla  schmidtorum schmidtorum_ occurs on the Pacific slopes of the Sierra  Madre in Chiapas and Guatemala, where it occurs with _P. euthysanota  euthysanota_; _P. schmidtorum chamulae_ is known from only two  localities on the Atlantic slopes of the Central Highlands of Chiapas,  where it occurs close to, but as now known not with, _P. euthysanota  macrotympanum_. On the Atlantic slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental in  northern Oaxaca _P. ignicolor_ occurs with _P. leonhardschultzei_.    In the Sierra de los Tuxtlas in southern Veracruz and in the cloud  forests along the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental  northward to Nuevo Leon, _Hyla miotympanum_ seems to be the ecological  replacement of _Ptychohyla_. On the Pacific slopes north of Guerrero,  Mexico, humid forests in which there are cascading mountain streams  are absent; consequently, no _Ptychohyla_ are known from that region.  In the mountains of El Salvador _Ptychohyla euthysanota euthysanota_  occurs sympatrically with another small stream-breeding hylid, _Hyla  salvadorensis_. To the south of Honduras the highlands diminish into  the lowlands of Nicaragua, where habitat suitable for _Ptychohyla_  apparently does not exist. In the mountains of Costa Rica and Panama,  the habitats occupied by _Ptychohyla_ in northern Central America are  filled by a variety of stream-breeding _Hyla_, such as _Hyla legleri_,  _H. rivularis_, _H. rufioculis_, _H. alleei_, and _H. uranochroa_.    Although members of the genus _Ptychohyla_ occur in the southern  part of the Mexican Highlands to the west of the Isthmus of  Tehuantepec, the greater distribution and differentiation in the  genus is in the Chiapan-Guatemalan Highlands. In this respect  _Ptychohyla_ is a counterpart of _Plectrohyla_.                                    Habitat Preference    Frogs of the genus _Ptychohyla_ are ecologically associated with  mountain streams at elevations between 650 and 2200 meters; in the  geographic region where these frogs occur the vegetation between those  elevations consists of cloud forest or pine-oak forest. In some places  the frogs have been found in a mixture of oak and semi-deciduous scrub  forest. At Vista Hermosa, Oaxaca, _P. leonhardschultzei_ and _P.  ignicolor_ were found in cloud forest, whereas at Agua del Obispo,  Guerrero, the former species was found in pine-oak forest. _Ptychohyla  schmidtorum_ is known only from cloud forest; _P. euthysanota  euthysanota_ and _P. spinipollex_ generally are found in cloud forest,  but in some places they live in pine-oak forest. _Ptychohyla  euthysanota macrotympanum_ has been found in pine-oak forest and in a  mixture of oak and semi-deciduous scrub forest. With the possible  exception of the members of the _Ptychohyla schmidtorum_ group, which  has been found only in cloud forest, it seems as though the type of  vegetation is not the controlling factor in the ecological  distribution of these frogs.    _Ptychohyla_ has been found only where there are clear, cascading  streams overhung by vegetation, on which adults and young perch at  night, or even by day. The presence of these streams, in which the  tadpoles live, seems to be an"]]]
