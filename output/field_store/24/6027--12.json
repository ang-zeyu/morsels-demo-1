Germany has always been a friendly nation, and a great many of our  people are of German ancestry. Why should we not deal with Germany  according to this plan to which the nation has pledged its support?    The second point of difference is as to the course which should be  pursued in regard to Americans traveling on belligerent ships or with  cargoes of ammunition.    Why should an American citizen be permitted to involve his country in  war by traveling upon a belligerent ship, when he knows that the ship  will pass through a danger zone? The question is not whether an  American citizen has a right, under international law, to travel on a  belligerent ship; the question is whether he ought not, out of  consideration for his country, if not for his own safety, avoid danger  when avoidance is possible.    It is a very one-sided citizenship that compels a Government to go to  war over a citizen's rights and yet relieve the citizen of all  obligations to consider his nation's welfare. I do not know just how  far the President can legally go in actually preventing Americans from  traveling on belligerent ships, but I believe the Government should go  as far as it can, and that in case of doubt it should give the benefit  of the doubt to the Government.    But even if the Government could not legally prevent citizens from  traveling on belligerent ships, it could, and in my judgment should,  earnestly advise American citizens not to risk themselves or the  peace of their country, and I have no doubt that these warnings would  be heeded.    President Taft advised Americans to leave Mexico when insurrection  broke out there, and President Wilson has repeated the advice. This  advice, in my judgment, was eminently wise, and I think the same  course should be followed in regard to warning Americans to keep off  vessels subject to attack.    I think, too, that American passenger ships should be prohibited from  carrying ammunition. The lives of passengers ought not to be  endangered by cargoes of ammunition, whether that danger comes from  possible explosions within or from possible attacks from without.  Passengers and ammunition should not travel together. The attempt to  prevent American citizens from incurring these risks is entirely  consistent with the effort which our Government is making to prevent  attacks from submarines.    The use of one remedy does not exclude the use of the other. The most  familiar illustration is to be found in the action taken by municipal  authorities during a riot. It is the duty of the Mayor to suppress the  mob and to prevent violence, but he does not hesitate to warn citizens  to keep off the streets during the riots. He does not question their  right to use the streets, but for their own protection and in the  interest of order he warns them not to incur the risks involved in  going upon the streets when men are shooting at each other.    The President does not feel justified in taking the action above  stated. That is, he does not feel justified, first, in suggesting the  submission of the controversy to investigation, or, second, in warning  the people not to incur the extra hazards in traveling on belligerent  ships or on ships carrying ammunition. And he may be right in the  position he has taken, but, as a private citizen, I am free to urge  both of these propositions and to call public attention to these  remedies, in the hope of securing such an expression of public  sentiment as will support the President in employing these remedies  if in the future he finds it consistent with his sense of duty to  favor them.    W.J. BRYAN.      \"THE REAL ISSUE.\"    Washington, June 10, 1915.    To the American people:    You now have before you the text of the note to Germany--the note  which it would have been my official duty to sign had I remained  Secretary of State. I ask you to sit in judgment upon my decision to  resign rather than to share responsibility for it.    I am sure you will credit me with honorable motives, but that is not  enough. Good intentions could not atone for a mistake at such a time,  on such a subject, and under such circumstances. If your verdict is  against me, I ask no mercy; I desire none if I have acted unwisely.    A man in public life must act according to his conscience, but,  however conscientiously he acts, he must be prepared to accept without  complaint any condemnation which his own errors may bring upon him; he  must be willing to bear any deserved punishment, from ostracism to  execution. But hear me before you pass sentence.    The President and I agree in purpose; we desire a peaceful solution of  the dispute which has arisen between the United States and Germany. We  not only desire it, but, with equal fervor, we pray for it; but we  differ irreconcilably as to the means of securing it.    If it were merely a personal difference, it would be a matter of  little moment, for all the presumptions are on his side--the  presumptions that go with power and authority. He is your President, I  am a private citizen without office or title--but one of the one  hundred million of inhabitants.    But the real issue is not between persons, it is between systems, and  I rely for vindication wholly upon the strength of the position taken.    Among the influences which Governments employ in dealing with each  other there are two which are pre-eminent and antagonistic--force and  persuasion. Force speaks with firmness and acts through the ultimatum;  persuasion employs argument, courts investigation, and depends upon  negotiation. Force represents the old system--the system that must  pass away; persuasion represents the new system--the system that has  been growing, all too slowly, it is true, but growing for 1,900 years.  In the old system war is the chief cornerstone--war, which at its best  is little better than war at its worst; the new system contemplates a  universal brotherhood established through the uplifting power of  example.    If I correctly interpret the note to Germany, it conforms to the  standards of the old system rather than to the rules of the new, and I  cheerfully admit that it is abundantly supported by precedents--precedents  written in characters of blood upon almost every page of human  history. Austria furnishes the most recent precedent; it was Austria's  firmness that dictated the ultimatum against Serbia, which set the  world at war.    Every ruler now participating in this unparalleled conflict has  proclaimed his desire for peace and denied responsibility for the war,  and it is only charitable that we should credit all of them with good  faith. They desired peace, but they sought it according to the rules  of the old system. They believed that firmness would give the best  assurance of the maintenance of peace, and, faithfully following  precedent, they went so near the fire that they were, one after  another, sucked into the contest.    Never before have the frightful follies of this fatal system been so  clearly revealed as now. The most civilized and enlightened--aye, the  most Christian--of the nations of Europe are grappling with each other  as if in a death struggle. They are sacrificing the best and bravest  of their sons on the battlefield; they are converting their gardens  into cemeteries and their homes into houses of mourning; they are  taxing the wealth of today and laying a burden of debt on the toil of  the future; they have filled the air with thunderbolts more deadly  than those of Jove, and they have multiplied the perils of the deep.    Adding fresh fuel to the flame of hate, they have daily devised new  horrors, until one side is endeavoring to drown noncombatant men,  women, and children at sea, while the other side seeks to starve  noncombatant men, women, and children on land. And they are so  absorbed in alternate retaliations and in competitive cruelties that  they seem, for the time being, blind to the rights of neutrals and  deaf to the appeals of humanity. A tree is known by its fruit. The war  in Europe is the ripened fruit of the old system.    This is what firmness, supported by force, has done in the Old World;  shall we invite it to cross the Atlantic? Already the jingoes of our  own country have caught the rabies from the dogs of war; shall the  opponents of organized slaughter be silent while the disease spreads?    As an humble follower of the Prince of Peace, as a devoted believer in  the prophecy that \"they that take the sword shall perish with the  sword,\" I beg to be counted among those who earnestly urge the  adoption of a course in this matter which will leave no doubt of our  Government's willingness to continue negotiations with Germany until  an amicable understanding is reached, or at least until, the stress of  war over, we can appeal from Philip drunk with carnage to Philip  sobered by the memories of a historic friendship and by a recollection  of the innumerable ties of kinship that bind the Fatherland to the  United States.    Some nation must lead the world out of the black night of war into the  light of that day when \"swords shall be beaten into plowshares.\" Why  not make that honor ours? Some day--why not now?--the nations will  learn that enduring peace cannot be built upon fear--that good-will  does not grow upon the stalks of violence. Some day the nations will  place their trust in love, the weapon for which there is no shield; in  love, that suffereth long and is kind; in love, that is not easily  provoked, that beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all  things, endureth all things; in love, which, though despised as  weakness by the worshippers of Mars, abideth when all else fails.    W.J. BRYAN.      THE GERMAN-AMERICANS.    Washington, June 11, 1915.

Nevile's  Court is 230 feet long from the inside of the pillars supporting the  Library to the wall of the Hall; and it has a mean breadth of 137 feet.
