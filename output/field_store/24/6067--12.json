Thus, the splendid Canopus, Betelgeux,  and Rigel can be inferred, from their indefinite remoteness, to exceed  our sun thousands of times in size and lustre; while many inconspicuous  objects, which prove to be in our relative vicinity, must be notably his  inferiors. The limits of real stellar magnitude are then set very widely  apart. At the same time, the so-called \"optical\" and \"geometrical\"  methods of relatively estimating star-distances are both seen to have a  foundation of fact, although so disguised by complicated relations as to  be of very doubtful individual application. On the whole, the chances  are in favour of the superior vicinity of a bright star over a faint  one; and, on the whole, the stars in swiftest _apparent_ motion are  amongst those whose _actual_ remoteness is least. Indeed, there is no  escape from either conclusion, unless on the supposition of special  arrangements in themselves highly improbable, and, we may confidently  say, non-existent.    The distances even of the few stars found to have measurable parallaxes  are on a scale entirely beyond the powers of the human mind to conceive.  In the attempt both to realize them distinctly, and to express them  conveniently, a new unit of length, itself of bewildering magnitude, has  originated. This is what we may call the _light-journey_ of one year.  The subtle vibrations of the ether, propagated on all sides from the  surface of luminous bodies, travel at the rate of 186,300 miles a  second, or (in round numbers) six billions of miles a year. Four and a  third such measures are needed to span the abyss that separates us from  the nearest fixed star. In other words, light takes four years and four  months to reach the earth from Alpha Centauri; yet Alpha Centauri lies  some ten billions of miles nearer to us (so far as is yet known) than  any other member of the sidereal system!    The determination of parallax leads, in the case of stars revolving in  known orbits, to the determination of mass; for the distance from the  earth of the two bodies forming a binary system being ascertained, the  seconds of arc apparently separating them from each other can be  translated into millions of miles; and we only need to add a knowledge  of their period to enable us, by an easy sum in proportion, to find  their combined mass in terms of that of the sun. Thus, since--according  to Dr. Doberck's elements--the components of Alpha Centauri revolve  round their common centre of gravity at a mean distance nearly 25 times  the radius of the earth's orbit, in a period of 88 years, the attractive  force of the two together must be just twice the solar. We may gather  some idea of their relations by placing in imagination a second luminary  like our sun in circulation between the orbits of Neptune and Uranus.  But systems of still more majestic proportions are reduced by extreme  remoteness to apparent insignificance. A double star of the fourth  magnitude in Cassiopeia (Eta), to which a small parallax is ascribed on  the authority of O. Struve, appears to be above eight times as massive  as the central orb of our world; while a much less conspicuous pair--85  Pegasi--exerts, if the available data can be depended upon, no less than  thirteen times the solar gravitating power.    Further, the actual rate of proper motions, so far as regards that part  of them which is projected upon the sphere, can be ascertained for stars  at known distance. The annual journey, for instance, of 61 Cygni _across  the line of sight_ amounts to 1,000, and that of Alpha Centauri to  446 millions of miles. A small star, numbered 1,830 in Groombridge's  Circumpolar Catalogue, \"devours the way\" at the rate of at least 150  miles a second--a speed, in Newcomb's opinion, beyond the gravitating  power of the entire sidereal system to control; and Mu Cassiopeiae  possesses above two-thirds of that surprising velocity; while for both  objects, radial movements of just sixty miles a second were disclosed  by Professor Campbell's spectroscopic measurements.    Herschel's conclusion as to the advance of the sun among the stars was  not admitted as valid by the most eminent of his successors. Bessel  maintained that there was absolutely no preponderating evidence in  favour of its supposed direction towards a point in the constellation  Hercules.[78] Biot, Burckhardt, even Herschel's own son, shared his  incredulity. But the appearance of Argelander's prize-essay in 1837[79]  changed the aspect of the question. Herschel's first memorable solution  in 1783 was based upon the motions of thirteen stars, imperfectly known;  his second, in 1805, upon those of no more than six. Argelander now  obtained an entirely concordant result from the large number of 390,  determined with the scrupulous accuracy characteristic of Bessel's work  and his own. The reality of the fact thus persistently disclosed could  no longer be doubted; it was confirmed five years later by the younger  Struve, and still more strikingly in 1847[80] by Galloway's  investigations, founded exclusively on the apparent displacements of  southern stars. In 1859 and 1863, Sir George Airy and Mr. Dunkin  (1821-1898),[81] employing all the resources of modern science, and  commanding the wealth of material furnished by 1,167 proper motions  carefully determined by Mr. Main, reached conclusions closely similar to  that indicated nearly eighty years previously by the first great  sidereal astronomer; which Mr. Plummer's reinvestigation of the subject  in 1883[82] served but slightly to modify. Yet astronomers were not  satisfied. Dr. Auwers of Berlin completed in 1866 a splendid piece of  work, for which he received in 1888 the Gold Medal of the Royal  Astronomical Society. It consisted in reducing afresh, with the aid of  the most refined modern data, Bradley's original stars, and comparing  their places thus obtained for the year 1755 with those assigned to them  from observations made at Greenwich after the lapse of ninety years. In  the interval, as was to be anticipated, most of them were found to have  travelled over some small span of the heavens, and there resulted a  stock of nearly three thousand highly authentic proper motions. These  ample materials were turned to account by M. Ludwig Struve[83] for a  discussion of the sun's motion, of which the upshot was to shift its  point of aim to the bordering region of the constellations Hercules and  Lyra. And the more easterly position of the solar apex was fully  confirmed by the experiments, with variously assorted lists of stars, of  Lewis Boss of Albany,[84] and Oscar Stumpe of Bonn.[85] Fresh  precautions of refinement were introduced into the treatment of the  subject by Ristenpart of Karlsruhe,[86] by Kapteyn of Groningen,[87] by  Newcomb[88] and Porter[89] in America, who ably availed themselves of  the copious materials accumulated before the close of the century. Their  results, although not more closely accordant than those of their  predecessors, combined to show that the journey of our system is  directed towards a point within a circle about ten degrees in radius,  having the brilliant Vega for its centre. To determine its rate was a  still more arduous problem. It involved the assumption, very much at  discretion, of an average parallax for the stars investigated; and Otto  Struve's estimate of 154 million miles as the span yearly traversed was  hence wholly unreliable. Fortunately, however, as will be seen further  on, a method of determining the sun's velocity independently of any  knowledge of star-distances, has now become available.    As might have been expected, speculation has not been idle regarding the  purpose and goal of the strange voyage of discovery through space upon  which our system is embarked; but altogether fruitlessly. The variety of  the conjectures hazarded in the matter is in itself a measure of their  futility. Long ago, before the construction of the heavens had as yet  been made the subject of methodical inquiry, Kant was disposed to regard  Sirius as the \"central sun\" of the Milky Way; while Lambert surmised  that the vast Orion nebula might serve as the regulating power of a  subordinate group including our sun. Herschel threw out the hint that  the great cluster in Hercules might prove to be the supreme seat of  attractive force;[90] Argelander placed his central body in the  constellation Perseus;[91] Fomalhaut, the brilliant of the Southern  Fish, was set in the post of honour by Boguslawski of Breslau. Maedler  (who succeeded Struve at Dorpat in 1839) concluded from a more formal  inquiry that the ruling power in the sidereal system resided, not in any  single prepondering mass, but in the centre of gravity of the  self-controlled revolving multitude.[92] In the former case (as we know  from the example of the planetary scheme), the stellar motions would be  most rapid near the centre; in the latter, they would become accelerated  with remoteness from it.[93] Maedler showed that no part of the heavens  could be indicated as a region of exceptionally swift movements, such as  would result from the presence of a gigantic (though possibly obscure)  ruling body; but that a community of extremely sluggish movements  undoubtedly existed in and near the group of the Pleiades, where,  accordingly, he placed the centre of gravity of the Milky Way.[94] The  bright star Alcyone thus became the \"central sun,\" but in a purely  passive sense, its headship being determined by its situation at the  point of neutralisation of opposing tendencies, and of consequent rest.  By an avowedly conjectural method, the solar period of revolution round  this point was fixed at 18,200,000 years.    The scheme of sidereal government framed by the Dorpat astronomer was,  it may be observed, of the most approved constitutional type;  deprivation, rather"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28257"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 1 (#13)"],[1,"infantry. This blow was struck at  the most inclement season of the year, in February snow and slush  and rain, as if to anticipate the allied attack which was generally  thought bound to come later in the spring when sufficient munitions  had been accumulated on the western front and the weather was  favorable.    By this time experts who had thought the war would be decided in the  Balkans had again realized that it never pays to desert the simple  military principle that the decision comes between the main bodies  of armies and not in remote regions from any clash of subsidiary  forces.    Paris or Petrograd in the hands of the Germans might mean such a  decision. Certainly, should the western front be broken by either  side, it would be the most telling blow of the war in both the moral  and the military sense. But after all, was the line of least  resistance for Germany the line of the western front? Would she  really strike her great blow of 1916--if she still had the power to  strike one--against the western rather than the eastern front?  Hitherto, attacks had succeeded against Russia.    It was in Russia that she had had her success. German officers had  always stated their confidence that with their superior gun fire and  tactics they could always force the Russians back. Could they press  back the French and the British?    When would the war end? seemed as unanswerable to the lay observer  in the spring of 1916 as in the spring of 1915. How long was the  fearful attrition to go on? Could either side ever strike a decisive  blow, or would the eventual result be a bloody stalemate, with  England still in command of the sea?    The significant generic lesson of the war is not in the power of  artillery, but the power of all material organization, when nations  set out to gain their ends by force: its military lesson was that  both sides had pretty well followed sound policy considering the  situation, despite armchair critics who knew nothing of inside  facts.    Europe was spending $100,000,000 or more a day in the business of  destruction--of life and of property. A broad belt of ruins spread  across France and Belgium for 450 miles; a broader one of 1,000  miles across Galicia and Russia. No nation engaged could be said to  be victorious except the Japanese. Japan had gained Kiao-chau;  strengthened her influence in China enormously, and was making  immense profits by working her arsenals and every plant at full  speed making munitions for Russia.    The United States at peace, preparing to make munitions as fast as  she could, and able to produce only 3,000 rifles a week for the  Allies on the 1st of December, 1915, and 5,000 a week March 1, 1916,  was enjoying an era of \"boom\" prosperity, thanks to the eager market  of nations whose own production was arrested while their workers  were at war. From the gloom of London and Paris, where men and women  had given up all luxuries, the transatlantic voyage brought you to  New York, which was the only gay capital in the world, enjoying all  the privileges of extravagance when money is plentiful.      WAR BY MACHINERY    This has been a war of machinery; but the old rule has been true  that development in any weapon of offense has been countered by  further development of means of defense. Nor is the theoretical  power of weapons ever equaled by their actual power when the test of  war comes. With self-preservation remaining the first law of nature,  man is in nothing so skillful as in avoiding the enemy's blows.    When one watches a 15-inch gun fired and hears its 2,000-pound shell  go screaming through the air, his concept of its destructive action  is exaggerated by imagination, and further confirmed if he sees that  shell burst inside a house, reducing its interior to wreckage. But  the shell may not hit the house; it may fall in an open field and  merely make a crater in the earth. Besides, someone must be in the  house when it is hit if there are to be any casualties; and it is  quite possible that a single person present might be dug out of the  debris unharmed. Vulnerable as man's flesh is, he remains a pretty  small object on the landscape. If he knows that his house is in  danger of being struck he then either goes into the cellar at the  first alarm, after having covered his floor with sandbags, or he may  take to a dugout in his yard.    When one has seen ten 15-inch shells strike a town of 25,000  inhabitants in a busy hour of the day and only half a dozen persons  killed and injured, he may learn a contempt for shell fire which,  however, is promptly turned into a tragic respect when one of the  same sort of shells strikes in a stone-paved courtyard where a  hundred soldiers are at their evening meal, and two-thirds of them  are killed and wounded.    The bursting of a shrapnel shell and its spray of low-velocity  bullets is also theoretically most destructive, but a roof of 6-inch  boards will furnish perfect protection from the bullets. Mother  Earth remains the best protection there is from fire. No rifle  bullet can penetrate through a 3-foot thickness of sandbags. A 6 or  8-inch high-explosive shell, which is the largest caliber  practicable for trench warfare, may burst near a double layer of  bags of stone rubble without hurting anyone in a cellar 30 feet  underneath. The rain of shrapnel bullets which mows the barbed wire  in front of a trench, as hail mows ripening grain, will not reach a  single man in the trench to the rear, if he keeps his head down.    At first thought it seems utterly inconsistent when bullets carry  effectively a mile and a half, and guns carry twenty miles, that  infantry should be fighting so close that they can throw bombs at each  other from distances of 15 and 20 yards. The very destructiveness of  modern weapons has contributed toward this result.    There has never been anything like so many guns used in battle, and  never have they been capable of such rapid fire. The field gun can  fire consistently eight or ten shots a minute, thanks to its modern  recoil cylinder and to the steadiness of aim, and literally  establish a \"curtain of fire\" with its torrent of bullets shot down  from the air and the cataracts of earth shot up by the bursting of  high-explosive shells in the ground, which no infantry can pass.    A machine gun behind a shield firing 500 shots a minute is  practically safe from rifle fire, and soldiers intrenched on either  side of it add to its volume their own more accurate fire from their  rifles. Infantry in the open, though they were not subjected to the  fearful concentration of artillery fire, could not survive through a  mile of machine-gun and rifle-swept space. Successful advances  against anything but very inferior numbers badly armed become  impossible in any frontal attack in the open. Thus all modern  infantry operations must have more or less a siege character, as the  only practicable means of approach is by digging your way forward.  The spade has become almost as important a weapon as the rifle.    Impatience with digging, which was characteristic of the early days  of the American Civil War, and which has been generally resented by  all armies in the past, has now become second nature to every  soldier, because its value is brought home to him by the most  telling kind of lesson in experience--death. He puts earth between  himself and the enemy's fire as instinctively as one holds up his  hand to ward off a blow.    In trench fighting all that is exposed of a man firing is his head  and shoulders, which accounts for the high percentage of dead to  wounded in this war. In other wars it has been as one to five; while  in this war, on the western front, it has varied from as one to two  and three. If the trenches are brought extremely close together then  either side is safe from the other's artillery fire, because there  is as much danger of hitting your own trench as the enemy's with  your shells. A distance of 20 or 30 yards meant that at any time  either side could start in throwing bombs or grenades by hand across  that one definitely neutral country--the zone of death between the  trenches. Beyond that range up to the average range, trench mortars  which \"lobbed\" a charge of high explosive from trench to trench  could be used. Thus the war of machinery became a war of explosives.  Anything that could be dropped into the trench and burst might kill  or wound some of the enemy, which meant debit on their side of the  ledger in a war of attrition and exhaustion. The higher the angle of  flight the more likely the charge actually to fall into the narrow  ditch in the earth, instead of breaking its force against the wall,  which accounts for the superiority of the howitzer with its high  angle of flight and shorter range to the gun with its lower  trajectory and longer range.    Thus there can be no limitation to the amount of artillery and the  quantities of explosives serviceable in this kind of warfare. No one  of the armies has ever had anything like enough shells. None ever  can. Five hundred guns of all ranges set back of one another from  3,000 to 20,000 yards' range to a mile could be placed, or 225,000  for the western front, and they could readily use five million  shells a day in this contest of munitions and manufacturing  resources.    All armies had to conserve their ammunition, and in parts of the  line, which were known as \"quiet corners,\" for tactical reasons the  stalemate was almost peaceful, either side holding its fire unless  the other became restless. But between the trenches which had  remained in the same position for many months, no living thing was  visible day after day except a rabbit or a field mouse where the  ground birds made their nests, and there the piping of birds joined  with the song of the bullets. Except for occasional snipers' shots  at the sight of anything moving on the enemy's parapet, the day wore  monotonously on--when"]]]
