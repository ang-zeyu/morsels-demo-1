Here are our  deadly enemies, who have scattered our troops, and have come to  besiege the capital of our kingdom. If we do not send them, by  daybreak to-morrow, twenty-four waggons, each drawn by six horses and  loaded with gold, they threaten to take the town and destroy it by  fire and sword, and to deliver our land to the soldiers. It is certain  that we cannot hold out any longer, and our royal treasure-house does  not contain one-half the amount demanded. Therefore, through me our  sovereign announces, that whosoever among you shall succeed, either in  defeating our foes, or in providing the money needed for the ransom,  him will he appoint his heir to the crown, and to him will he give his  only daughter in marriage, a princess of marvellous beauty. Further,  he shall receive half the kingdom in his own right.\"    When the fisherman heard these words he went to the king and said, \"My  sovereign and father, command that twenty-four waggons, each harnessed  with twenty-four horses and provided with leathern bags, be brought  into the courtyard; I will engage to fill them with gold, and that at  once, before your eyes.\"    Then he left the palace, and standing in the middle of the large  square, recited the words the fish had taught him.    These were followed by rumblings of thunder and flashes of lightning,  and then by a perfect hurricane which sent down masses and showers of  gold. In a few minutes the square was covered with a layer of gold so  thick that, after loading the twenty-four waggons and filling a large  half of the royal treasure-house, there was enough left to make  handsome presents to all the king's officers and servants.    Next day the enemy returned to their own country laden with the heavy  ransom they had demanded.    The king sent for the fisherman, and inviting him to partake of  hydromel wine and sweetmeats, said, \"You have to-day been the means of  saving our capital from a great calamity, and shall, therefore,  receive the reward which you have earned. My only daughter, a princess  of great beauty, shall be your wife, and I will give you the half of  my kingdom for a wedding present. I also appoint you my heir to the  throne. But tell me, to whom am I indebted? What kingdom or land  belongs to you? How is it that by a mere movement of the hand you were  able to supply my enemies with such a quantity of gold?\"    And the fisherman, simple-hearted and straightforward as a child,  ignorant of the deceptions practised in court, answered frankly,  \"Sire, I belong to no royal or princely family, I am a simple  fisherman and your loyal subject. I procure my gold by means of this  magic ring, and at any time I can have as much as I want.\"    Then he told how his good fortune had come to him.    The king made no answer, but it hurt his royal dignity to think that  he owed his safety to one of his own peasants, and that he had  promised to make him his son-in-law.    That evening, after a luxurious supper, the fisherman, having taken a  little more wine than usual, ventured to ask the king to present him  to his bride. The king whispered a few words in the ear of the  chamberlain of the court, and then went out.    The chamberlain took the fisherman to the top of the castle tower, and  there said to him, \"According to the customs of the court you should,  before being introduced to the princess, send her by my hands some  valuable jewel as a wedding gift.\"    \"But I have nothing of value or beauty about me,\" replied he, \"unless  you offer the princess this golden ring, to which I owe all my good  fortune, the princess herself, and the safety of her father.\"    The chamberlain took the ring, and opening the window of the tower,  asked, \"Fisherman, do you see the moon in the heavens?\"    \"I do.\"    \"Very well, she shall be the witness of your betrothal. Now look down;  do you see that precipice, and the deep river shining in its depths.\"    \"I do.\"    \"Very well, it shall be your bridal couch.\"    So saying the chamberlain threw him into the deep abyss, shut the  window, and ran to tell the king that there was no longer a suitor for  the hand of his daughter.    The fisherman, stunned by the force of his fall, reached the water  quite senseless. When he came to himself and opened his eyes, he lay  in a boat which at that moment was leaving the mouth of the river and  entering the open sea.    The very old man, to whom he had given the bream, was guiding the  vessel with an oar.    \"My good old man, is it you? How did you manage to save me?\" asked the  astonished fisherman.    \"I came to your assistance,\" replied the old man, \"because he who  shows pity to others deserves their help when in need of it. But take  the oar and row to whatever place you wish.\"    And having thus spoken the mysterious old man disappeared. The  fisherman crossed himself, and having looked round upon the royal  palace sparkling with light he sighed deeply, and chanting the hymn  \"Under Thy Help,\" put out to sea.    When the sun rose he saw some nets in the boat, and throwing them into  the water caught some pike, which he sold in a town near the shore,  and then continued his journey on foot.    Two or three months later, when crossing some open country, he heard  cries for help which came from a hill near the forest. There he saw  two little demons pulling each other's hair. By the cut of their short  waistcoats, by their tight pantaloons and three-cornered hats, he knew  that they were inhabitants of the nether world, from which they must  have escaped. He had no doubt about it, but being a good Christian he  was not afraid, and accosted them boldly, saying, \"Why do you  ill-treat each other in this way? What is the meaning of it?\"    \"It means, that for many a long year we have both been working hard to  entice a silly fellow down below. He was first tempted by the desire  to learn something of sorcery, and he ended by becoming an  accomplished scoundrel. After giving him time to commit a great many  crimes and thus forfeit his soul, we handed him over to safe keeping.  Now we want to divide his property between us. He has left three  things, which by every right belong to us. The first is a wonderful  carpet. Whoever sits down upon it, and pronounces certain magic words,  will be carried off at once, over forests and under clouds, never  stopping until his destination is reached. The magic words are as  follows:      'Carpet, that of thyself through space takes flight,    O travel, thou airy car, both day and night    Till my desired haven comes in sight.'    The second piece of property is that club lying on the grass. After  uttering some magic words, the club will immediately begin to hit so  vigorously that a whole army may be crushed to pieces or dispersed.  The words run thus:      'Club, thou marvellous club, who knows    How to strike and smite my foes,    By thine own strength and in God's name    O strike well home and strike again.'    The third piece of property is a cap that renders its wearer  invisible. Now, my good man, you see our difficulty: there are but two  of us, and we are fighting to decide how these three lots may be  divided into two equal parts.\"    \"I can help you,\" said the fisherman, \"provided you will do as I tell  you. Leave the three lots here just as they are--the carpet, the club,  and the magic cap. I will roll a stone from the top of this hill to  the bottom--whoever catches it first shall have two lots for his  share. What do you say?\"    \"Agreed!\" cried the demons, racing after the stone that rolled and  bounded on its way down.    In the meantime the fisherman hastily put on the cap, seized the club,  and sitting down on the carpet, repeated the magic formula without  forgetting a single word.    He was already high up in the air when the demons returned carrying  the stone and calling out to him to come and reward the winner.    \"Come down and divide those things between us,\" they cried after him.    The fisherman's only answer was the magic address to his club. This  enchanted weapon then fell upon them and struck so hard that the  country round echoed to the sound thereof. In the midst of screams and  cries and clouds of dust they escaped at last, and the club, of its  own accord, came back and placed itself at the fisherman's orders. He,  in spite of the rapid motion, sat comfortably on the carpet with the  cap under his arm and the club in his hand. Thus they flew over  forests, under clouds, and so high that seen from the earth they  looked like a tiny white cloud.    Within two or three days they stopped at the king's capital. The  fisherman, with his cap on, descended into the middle of the  courtyard.    The whole place was in confusion and trouble, for the commander of the  foreign army, encouraged by having so easily received such a large sum  of money, had returned to the attack and again held the town in siege,  declaring that he would destroy every house and slay all the  inhabitants, not sparing even the king himself, unless he agreed to  give him his only daughter in marriage.    The terrified citizens crowded to the palace and besought his majesty  to do as they asked him, and so save them from such a fate. The king,  standing on the balcony, addressed them thus: \"Faithful and devoted  people, listen to me. Nothing but a miracle can save us from this  fearful calamity; yet it has happened that the most powerful  assailants have been forced to ask mercy of the most feeble. I will  never consent to the marriage of my only daughter with my most hated  and cruel foe. Within a few moments my guards will be ready for  combat, and I myself will lead them against the enemy. If there be any  among you who can win the victory, to him will I give my only daughter  in marriage, the half of my kingdom for her dowry, and the heirship to  the throne.\"    When he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25568"],[0,"Domesticated Animals (#13)"],[1,"at  separation from their masters or of pleasure when they return to them.  Although there are many stories appearing to indicate a certain  faithfulness in horses which have remained beside their fallen and  wounded riders, the facts do not justify us in supposing that such  actions are due to the affection a dog clearly feels.    [Illustration: Horses for Towing on the Beach in Holland]    We have been singularly led astray by a chance use of the epithet  \"horse,\" which has come to be applied to many organic forms and  functions where strength is indicated. Thus, in the case of plants we  speak of \"horse-radish\" or \"horse-mint,\" denoting thereby spices which  have strong qualities. Horse-chestnut is another instance of the  application of the term to plants. It chanced that \"horse-sense\" came  to be used to indicate a sound understanding, and in an obscure way,  but in a manner common with words, this has led to a vague implication  of mental capacity in the animals whence the term is derived. The fact  is that our horses, as far as their mental powers are concerned,  appear to be the least improvable of our great domesticated animals.    [Illustration: A Hurdle Jumper]    Little elastic as the horse appears to be on the psychic side of its  nature, in its physical aspects it is one of the most plastic of all the  forms subjected to the breeder's art. It requires no more than a glance  at the streets of our large cities to see how great is the range in  size, form, and carriage of these animals which may be found in any of  our great centres of civilization. We readily perceive that these  variations have a distinct relation to the several divisions of human  activity in which this creature has a share. The massive cart-horse,  weighing it may be as much as eighteen hundred or two thousand pounds,  heavy limbed, big headed, unwilling to move at a pace faster than a slow  trot, yet not without the measure of beauty seemingly inseparable from  the species, contrasts very markedly with the alert saddle animal bred  for speed and grace, and for the easy movement which makes it  comfortable to the equestrian. Between these extremes we may note minor  differences which, though they may not strike those persons who take  only a commonplace view of the creatures, are most marked to the  initiated. The trotter, the coach horse, the strong but nimble animals  which are used in fire-engines and other heavy carriages which have to  be swiftly moved, mark the results of breeding designed to insure  particular qualities, and show how readily the physical features of the  animal can be made to fit to our desires.    Although from an early day a certain amount of care has been given to  breeding horses for saddle purposes, the careful and continuous choice  which has led to the modern variations is a matter of only a few  centuries of endeavor. So far as we can judge from the classic  monuments, the olden varieties were mere varieties of the pony--the  small, compact, agile creature which had not departed far from the  parent wild form. It seems to me doubtful whether any of the horses  possessed by the Greeks or Romans attained a weight much exceeding a  thousand pounds, or had the peculiarities of our modern breeds. The  first considerable departure from the original type appears to have  been brought about when it became necessary to provide a creature  which could serve as a mount for the heavy armored knights of the  Middle Ages, where man and horse were weighted with from one to two  hundred pounds of metal. To serve this need it was necessary to have a  saddle animal of unusual strength, weighing about three-quarters of a  ton, easily controllable and at once fairly speedy and nimble. To meet  this necessity the Norman horse was gradually evolved, the form  naturally taking shape in that part of Europe where the iron-clad  warrior was most perfectly developed. In the tapestries and other  illustrative work of that day, when the knight won tournaments and  battle-fields, gaining victory by the weight and speed which he  brought to bear upon his enemies, we can see this splendid animal, in  physical form, at least, the finest product of man's care and skill in  the development of the lower species.    With the advance in the use of firearms the value of the Norman horse  in the art of war rapidly diminished. This breed, however, has, with  slight modifications, survived, and is extensively used for draught  purposes where strength at the sacrifice of speed is demanded. It is a  curious fact that the creatures which now draw the beer wagons of  London often afford the nearest living successors in form to the  horses which bore the mediaeval knights. It is an ignoble change, but  we must be grateful for any accident which has preserved to us, though  in a somewhat degraded form, this noblest product of the breeder's  art, which, even as much as the valor of our ancestors, won success  for our Teutonic folk in their great struggle with Islam. A tincture  of this Norman blood, perhaps the firmest fixed in the species of any  variety, pervades many other strains most valuable in our arts. The  best of our artillery horses, particularly those set next the wheels,  are generally in part Norman. In the well-known American Morgan, the  swiftest and strongest of our harnessed forms, the observant eye  detects indications of this masterful blood.    The Norman strains of horses retain certain interesting indications of  their ancient lineage and occupation. As appears to be common with old  breeds, the stock is readily maintained. It breeds true to its  ancestry, with little tendency to those aberrations so common in the  newly instituted varieties. When crossed with other strains, the  effect of the intermixture of this strong blood is distinctly  traceable for many generations. In their mental habits these creatures  still appear to show something of the effects of their old use in war;  it is a valiant race, less given to insane fear than other strains,  and, even under excitement, more controllable than the most of their  kindred. So far as I have been able to learn, they seem singularly  free from those wild panics which are so common among our ordinary  horses. It does not seem to me fanciful to suppose that these  qualities were bred in the stock during the centuries of experience  with the confusion of battle-fields and tournaments.    [Illustration: Exercising the Thoroughbreds]    The horse, in common with the other domesticated animals varying  readily in the hands of the breeder, undergoes a certain spontaneous  change which in a way corresponds to the physiography of the region in  which it is bred. At first sight it may seem as if these alterations  are due to the admixture of previously existing varieties, or to the  institution of peculiarities by some process of selection. I am,  however, well convinced that these variations are in good part due to a  direct influence from the environment. Thus in our high northern lands  there is a distinct and spontaneous reduction in size of the creatures,  which attains its farthest point in the Shetland pony. Again, as we go  toward the tropics, a like though less conspicuous decrease in bulk is  observable. The largest animals of the species develop in the middle  latitudes, the realm where the form appears to have acquired its  characters. The speed with which these local variations are made is  often great. Thus the horses of Kentucky have, in about a century,  acquired a certain stamp of the soil which makes it possible, in most  cases, for the observer to identify an individual as from that State,  though he may find it in a field a thousand miles away. The defining  indications are not limited altogether to bodily form, but are shown in  what might seem trifling features of carriage and behavior. The  difference between the horses of Great Britain and those of the United  States seems to me, from repeated observations, to be quite as great as  that separating the men of the two realms. I believe that if a lot of a  thousand, taken in equal parts from either land, were put together, a  person well accustomed to taking account of these animals could  separate them into two herds, with less than ten per cent. of error. It  is doubtful if a more perfect selection could be made if the same  experiment were tried on an equal number of men, provided the indices  to be derived from peculiarities of speech or dress could be excluded.    [Illustration: An Arabian Horse]    By some the Arabian horse is thought to be the most remarkable  specialization of the kind which has been attained. In his native  country and in his perfection, the Arab breed has been seen by but  few persons who have been specially trained in noting the  peculiarities of the animal. So far as I have been able to judge by  pictures and a few specimens, said to be thoroughbreds of their  stock, which I have had a chance to see, the Arabian form of the  horse appears to have been led less far away from the primitive  stock than many of our European and American varieties.    [Illustration: Arabian Sports]    The very great, if not the preeminent, success of the horse in Arabia  is the more remarkable from the fact that it has been attained under  conditions which, from an _a priori_ point of view, must be deemed  most unfavorable. This variety has been bred in a land of scant  herbage and deficient water-supply, where the creature has had from  time to time, indeed we may say generally, to endure something of the  dearth of food which stunts the Indian ponies and the other horses of  the Cordilleran district. The ancestors of the horse appear to have  attained their development in well-watered and fertile regions. All  the varieties bred within the limits of civilization do best on rich  pasturages such as Arabia does not afford. The success of the horse in  that land shows how devoted must have been"]]]
