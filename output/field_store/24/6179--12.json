A full, loose gown, with the fullness pleated to back and  front, came in, the front being held by a bow and the back allowed to  fall loose or crossed with a large bow at the back of waist, as in the  museum specimen, Fig. 85. This became the more elaborate sack-back  dress.    [Illustration: FIG. 84.--Period 1700-1725.]    The skirts began to be set out in a bell form, and trains were in much  favour; the overskirts were parted in front, and many looped up to the  back in a similar manner to the last reign. Small aprons of fine  embroidery were worn with the best of dresses, and embroidered pockets  are seen when the skirts were thrown back. Petticoats of fine quilting  became much appreciated, and tall sticks were carried by ladies. Pointed  shoes with high heels and latchets tied or buckled, the top of the  fronts being mostly cut into four points, or they had a square finish.      EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. ANNE. MALE.    The wigs of the full ringlet style were still the fashion, but a simpler  character is noticeable, the hair being combed back off the forehead and  allowed to fall in looser waves. But many began to set a mode of smaller  \"coiffure,\" with their own hair caught in curls by a bow at the back,  and curls over each ear. Powder came into use with the smart set, and a  big bow and bag to finish the back of wig appeared, giving a smarter  appearance to the white hair.

(_c_) Dress of Spotted Stockinette. 1795-1808.]    [Illustration: FIG. 85.--Bodice types. 1700-1725.]    The hat, sometimes of white felt, was the same three-cornered type,  edged with feathers and banded with broad gold braids or silver lace.  The neckwear was a bind of lawn, with a long fall finished with lace.    The coat remained long to the knees, but took a greater fullness in the  side pleats of the skirt. Large buttons and buttonholes, 3 inches long,  are seen, with the same on the cuff, which was worn very large, often 9  inches broad, and mostly of a curved outline, and of another coloured  brocade; a tight undersleeve is also seen with these. The coat was  sometimes heavily decorated with needlework or braids of gold down the  front, pockets, seams, and cuffs. The pocket was wide and set higher in  the skirt, and the back opening of coat was decorated by several  horizontal braids to the two side pleats.    A long, full-skirted waistcoat, of rich materials or needlework, was at  times braided and fringed at the skirt with gold, the pockets covered  with a large flap, and five buttons fastened it or were placed as  decorations just below it. The front buttons were often reduced to four  at the waist, as it was still fashionable to show the lawn shirt.    Breeches were of the same cut as in the former reign, with five or six  side buttons at the knee, and stockings with embroidered clocks were  worn rolled over outside the breeches as before.    Shoes were square at the toes and not quite so long, while the heels  were still rather heavy, and red was the mode. They had a high square  top at the front instep, and buckles fastened the latchets. Muffs were  often carried by the dandies, and walking-sticks, with tassel and loop,  were slung on the arm; besides a sword, which, passing through the side  pleats and out at the back, helped to set out the coat, which was often  stiffened in the skirts. Gloves, with short gauntlets very angular or  curved in shape, were trimmed with gold fringe; the backs were also  richly embroidered with gold or silver.      EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. GEORGE I.

Occasionally a group of curls was allowed to  fall behind, or a curl was arranged to fall on one shoulder, and  waved curls of the Queen Anne type were still seen on many people. Caps,  with long dropping points in front, sometimes tied under the chin or  with long lappets at the back, were the chief favourites, also a small  frilled cap. Shallow-crowned straw hats with various widths of brim;  hoods and capes, both short and long, are seen, besides light silks  draped from the hair to the waist, feathers, flowers, and ribbons being  worn in the head-dress. Richly embroidered aprons were worn with the  finest dresses.    The sack-back dress was very full, and started right across the  shoulders in two double box-pleats, which were kept trim by being sewn  flat for two to four inches down. Sleeves to the elbow were rather full,  and gathered at the shoulders, with a square cuff often decorated with a  bow in front, and a fan of lace, sometimes in several rows, fell from  beneath. Sleeves finishing in a shaped edge are occasionally seen. The  skirts were made for the very round hoop setting, and were gathered in  flat pleats on either hip. A wide pleat or two came from the shoulders  down the front sometimes as a continuation of the sack-back. These  pleats, meeting at the waist, formed a =V= shape, which was filled by an  embroidered stomacher, or made of the same material, crossed by bands,  bows, or rows of lace. The flat front pleat was occasionally  embroidered, and gradually widened to the bottom of the skirt. Very  pointed toes to the shoes, and high heels, with tied or buckled  latchets, are seen, the tops of the front often being shaped into four  points.      EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. GEORGE I. MALE.    Long, full wigs are still seen amongst older men, but several new shapes  appear as illustrated (Fig. 90), and the black bow and bag became very  large; a black ribbon attached to it, with a bow in front, came round  the neck. We also see the ends of the wig made into a long, tight  pigtail. Hats were of the same three-cornered shape, rather fuller in  size, and the feathered edging was still favoured. A hat of the type of  Fig. 105 was also worn; and the loose cap with a tassel was put on when  the wig was removed (see Fig. 104).

A  vertical pocket is seen occasionally on cloth coats, also a cape and  turned-down collar are noted, while several appear with a very small  upright collar. Buttons were still worn on some coats, right down the  front; but on many coats the buttons stopped level with the pocket.    A short-skirted coat came in amongst the dandies towards the end of the  reign, and was stiffened out on the skirts; these mostly had a tighter  sleeve and cuff. The same decorations continued in use. Waistcoats were  much the same, and were cut to the length of the coats, or about four  inches shorter; they were buttoned higher, the lace often falling  outside.    Breeches were the same in cut, fastened with six buttons and a buckle at  the side of the knee. The stockings, usually decorated with clocks, were  still worn rolled outside the knee amongst smart people. The stiff high  boots or gaiters generally had a full curved piece at the top, and short  gaiters to the calf are also to be noticed.    The shoes were square-toed or of a roundish form, with a short or  rather high square front, and heels of various heights. Patches and  make-up were used by the fops, and swords and sticks carried, the latter  being very high, to 46 inches.      EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. GEORGE II. FEMALE.    The hair was treated in much the same manner as with George I up to the  end of this reign--gathered back from the forehead to a bunch of curls  at the back. The small hats and caps, often worn together, continued of  the same character; the dresses also remained similar in cut. The  sack-back dress was supreme in the fifties, when it was set with  panniers, together with the hoops, but the latter were not so much worn  towards the end of this reign, except for the \"grand dress.\" Quilted  petticoats were much worn, but flounces are not a feature on the skirts  till the latter part of this period. The simpler dress was of various  lengths, and was at times worn quite short up to 1740. The corset bodice  was still in use, with lawn sleeves: square cuffs and lace ruffles held  the lead throughout this time, but the fan-shaped sleeve finish to  the elbow, in the same material as the dress, began to appear about  1750, generally with a waved or scalloped edge. Pointed toes and  high-heeled shoes continued, with either tied or buckled latchets, and  long gloves and mittens were "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34984"],[0,"A Guide for the Study of Animals (#13)"],[1,"   18.

THE CONNECTION BETWEEN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION    _A Review of the Work done on the First Four Groups of Animals_      Review all your studies on the protozoa, sponges, coelenterates,  and worms. Write the results in the following summary:--    1. What work, _i.e._ labor, must an animal do to live?    2. How many cells are necessary to do this work?    3. When this work is divided among a number of cells, what is the  effect upon the quantity and quality of work accomplished?    4. When this work is divided among a number of cells, how does the  structure of the cells show it? How does the arrangement of the cells  also show it? Give examples.    5. The technical expression for this specialization of cells, giving  them different functions, is \"division of labor.\" Formulate a clear  definition for this expression, giving an example to illustrate it.    6. Is division of labor a good thing for an animal body, or is it  not? Give reasons for your opinion, with examples for illustration.          CHAPTER IV    ADAPTATION TO SURROUNDINGS      #A STUDY OF CRUSTACEA#    #To Show the General Adaptation of an Invertebrate to its  Surroundings#      1. A STUDY OF CRAYFISHES          _Materials._    Crayfishes, living and preserved. Some of the living crayfishes  should be established in conditions as natural as possible _i.e._ in  an inch or so of fresh water, with rocks, weeds, etc., and left  undisturbed. Small crayfishes are desirable to show locomotion in  water.      Living Crayfishes          _Directions and observations._    1. Observe living crayfishes in their usual habitat or in a large  aquarium, without disturbing them, and see where they stay when they  are free to choose. Notice their position. What senses are on guard?  What is the color of the head and claws? How may this color aid the  animal in getting food or in escaping enemies? Why is the color of  the posterior region less important than the color of the anterior?    2. Offer them bits of meat. If one takes food, notice the appendages  it uses. How does it discover the food? With what appendages does it  grasp the food? How is the food conveyed to the mouth? With what  senses, if any, does the animal test the food as it eats it?    3. If the crayfishes are in plenty of water and you startle them in  any way, some of them may swim. Watch for such an occurrence and  notice it carefully. How is swimming accomplished? Which end leads in  swimming? How far does the animal swim at a stroke? How long does it  continue to swim? Where does it go? Does it see where it is going?  For what purpose would this method of locomotion be useful?    4. Place a living crayfish in a tray with water to cover it, and take  it to your table. Watch the crayfish as it walks about in the water,  then take it out and let it walk out of water. Compare the two  processes. What causes the differences?    5. How many appendages are used in walking? What order, if any, is  there in moving the legs? Which method, walking or swimming, does it  use in going to some particular spot, _e.g._ in going to find food or  cover? Why?    6. Gently turn the animal on its back and watch the movements of its  appendages as it rights itself. Which appendages does it use and how  does it use them? How can it manage to use so many appendages in  harmony, for one result?    7. For what different purposes have you seen the crayfishes use their  large claws? For which does the claw seem best fitted? Can you think  of any change which would make it more efficient for its main  purpose? If so, describe the change and tell how it would work.    8. Test the distribution of the sense of feeling. Is it anywhere  especially acute? If so, where? Why have two pairs of feelers? Where  is each pair carried when the animal is at rest; when it is in  motion? How much territory can the two pairs guard?    9. Touch the eyes. Compare their sensitiveness with that of your own  eyes. What movements can the eyes perform? How are they protected?  What range of territory can they guard?    10. What other senses, if any, do you think a crayfish has? Why do  you think so?    11. Early in the spring crayfishes may be found carrying eggs or  young. If such a specimen is at hand, notice where and how the eggs  or young are attached. How many are there? How are they cared for?  Can the young crayfish let go? If removed, can they attach themselves  again? How much care does the mother give them when they are removed?      Morphology of a Crayfish          _Definitions._    _Cephalo-thorax_, the anterior half of the body, divided into the  head and the thorax.    _Cervical groove_, the groove dividing the head from the thorax.    _Abdomen_, the posterior half of the body, consisting of a number of  somites.      _Note._--The central part of the tail fin is usually included as    a somite.    _Carapace_, the continuous shell-like portion of the exoskeleton  covering the cephalo-thorax.    _Rostrum_, the sharp projection of the carapace at the anterior end.    _Gill chamber_, a pocket on each side of the thorax, covered by a  flap of the carapace.    _Appendages_, paired structures attached to the body. They are named  as follows:--      _Eyestalks._ (These are not classed as appendages by all students.)      _Antennules_, the small feelers.      _Antennae_, the large feelers.      _Mandibles_, the jaws, one on each side of the mouth.      _Maxillae_, the two pairs of small mouth parts just back of the    mandibles.      _Maxillipeds_, the three pairs of appendages between the maxillae    and the large claws.      _Chelipeds_, the large claws or pinchers.      _Walking legs_, the four pairs of appendages back of the chelipeds.      _Swimmerets_, the appendages on the abdomen.    _Openings_, five on the ventral surface, as follows:--      The openings from the excretory organs, through small white cones    on the bases of the antennae.      The mouth, farther back, between the maxillipeds.      The anal opening, in the last segment of the abdomen.      The opening from the reproductive gland, toward the posterior    part of the thorax.          _Observations._    1. How large is your specimen? How does it compare in size with other  crayfishes in the laboratory?    2. Describe the shape of the body, contrasting the anterior end with  the posterior, and the dorsal surface with the ventral.    3. Study the amount of motion permitted in different parts of the  body. What prevents motion? What permits it? Where is the body most  flexible? Why? Where is it most rigid? Why?    4. How much of the surface is covered with exoskeleton? What  arrangement is there to permit the animal to feel contact?      How can the animal grow with such an exoskeleton?    5. Place a dead crayfish in dilute acid for a few hours. What is the  result? What has the acid done? Explain the fact that crayfishes are  often found alive and well with a soft shell?    6. Compare the cephalo-thorax with the abdomen as to size, shape, and  flexibility.    7. How many somites are there in the abdomen? Which way does it bend?  Study the somite shells on every side and then state what there is in  their construction which determines the direction and amount of their  motion. How are the somite shells arranged to protect the body during  bending? How is the ventral surface of the abdomen protected?    8. Where are the appendages attached? Study a walking leg and  describe its general construction, the number and kind of joints, the  direction of motion in each joint, and the range of motion for the  whole leg. Study an antenna in the same way. What methods are used in  the crayfish to secure a wide range of motion? To secure flexibility?    9. Carefully split a crayfish into right and left halves. To do this,  first cut through the ventral exoskeleton from end to end with  scissors, then with a sharp knife or razor cut through to the dorsal  exoskeleton and cut that with the scissors. Study one half, to get a  better idea of the attachment of the appendages. These may then be  removed and placed in order on a piece of paper upon which a list of  the appendages has been written.    10. How many pairs of appendages are there? How may they be grouped  according to location; how grouped according to function? How many  pairs are there in each group?    11. What similarities of structure do you find in nearly all of the  appendages? Assuming a swimmeret of the third, fourth, or fifth  somite to be the least changed from the primitive type, what changes  were necessary to make the sixth swimmeret; the third maxilliped; the  walking legs; the antennae; the antennules?    12. Remove the part of the carapace which covers a gill chamber. What  are the boundaries of the chamber? Where does it open to the water?    13. Describe the appearance and the texture of a gill. How are the  gills kept moist when the crayfish is in water; when it is on land?  Why should they be kept moist?    14. Would you class the gills as external structures or as internal?  Why do you think so? To what are they attached? How are the gills  affected by the motion of the legs?      15. What work goes on in the gills? How is the supply of oxygen    renewed? In this connection, try a live crayfish, kept quiet in   "]]]
