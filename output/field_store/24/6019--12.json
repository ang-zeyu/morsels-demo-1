His route thenceforth was by Dijon,  Les Rousses, and the Col de la Faucille, whence he reached Geneva,  after crossing the Swiss frontier, in a torrential rain.    From Geneva he reentered France by the Pont de la Caille, then to  Aiguebelle and St. Jeanne de Maurienne, where the women wear the most  theatrical picturesque costumes to be seen in France.    After passing Modane and Lanslebourg he followed the ascent of Mont  Cenis for ten kilometres before he reached the summit of the pass.  Within three kilometres he struck the snow-line, and the falling snow  continued to the summit. Here he found two _douaniers_ and two  _gendarmes_, who appeared glad enough to have the monotony of their  lonely vigil relieved by the advent of an automobile, quite unlooked  for at this season of the year.    The descent to Susa and the great plain of the Po was long and  dangerous. It is sixty-two kilometres from Modane to Susa, either  up-hill or down-hill, with the descent by far the longest. It is one  of the most enjoyable routes between France and Italy. Once on the  Italian side the whole climatic aspect of things changes. The towns  are highly interesting whenever met with, and the panoramas superb,  but there is a marked absence of that active life of the fields, of  cattle and human labourers that one remarks in France.    From Turin the route of this energetic little car passed Plaisance,  crossed the Appenines between Bologna and Florence, and so to Venice,  or rather to Mestre, where the car was put in a garage while the  conductor paid his respects to the Queen of the Adriatic.    From Mestre the route lay by Udine, Pontebba, Pontafel, Villac  Judenburg, and Murzzuschlag, through Styria to Vienna, with the  roadways continually falling off in excellence. Here are M. Cormier's  own words: \"_Mais, par exemple, comme routes, Dieu que c'est mauvais!  Malgre cela, j'y retournerai; le pays vaut la peine que l'on affronte  les cailloux, les ornieres, les dos d'ane at les derapages sur le sol  mouille, comme je l'ai trop trouve, helas!_\"    Of the road from Vienna, through Moravia and Bohemia, the tourist  wrote also feelingly. \"May I never see those miserable countries  again,\" he said. Things must have improved in the last two or three  years, but the cause of the little De Dion's troubles was the  frequent recurrence of culverts or _canivaux_ across the road. Five  hundred in one day nearly did for the little De Dion, or would have  done so had not it been carefully driven.    From Prague the German frontier was crossed at Zinnwalo, a tiny  hamlet well hidden on a mountain-top, beyond which is a descent of  fifty kilometres to Dresden. From Dresden to Berlin the way lay over  delightful forest roads, little given to traffic, and most enjoyable  at any season of the year, unless there be snow upon the ground.    From Berlin the route was by Magdebourg, Hanover, Munster, and Wesel,  and Holland was entered at Beek, a little village ten kilometres from  Nymegen. At Nymegen the Waal was crossed by a steam ferry-boat, and  at Arnhem the Rhine was passed by a bridge of boats, a surviving  relic in Continental Europe still frequently to be found, as at Wesel  and Dusseldorf in Germany, and even in Italy, near Ferrara on the Po.    Utrecht came next, then Amsterdam--\"a little tour of Holland,\" as the  De Dion's conductor put it. In the suburbs of the large Dutch towns,  notably Utrecht, one makes his way through miles and miles of garden  walls, half-hiding coquettish villas. The surface of the roads here  is formed of a peculiar variety of paving that makes them beloved of  automobilists, it being of small brick placed edgewise, and very  agreeable to ride and drive upon.    From Utrecht the route was more or less direct to Antwerp. At the  Belgian frontier acquaintance was made with that horrible  granite-block road-bed, for which Belgium is notorious. After  Antwerp, Brussels, then forty-five kilometres of road even worse--if  possible--than that which had gone before. (The Belgian _chauffeurs_  call that portion of the route between Brussels and Gemblout a  disgrace to Belgium.) The French frontier was gained, through Namur,  at Rocroi, and Paris reached, via Meaux, thirty-nine days after the  capital had previously been quitted.    [Illustration: How Not To Travel]    This was probably the most remarkable \"grand tour\" which had been  made up to that time, and it was done with a little six horse-power  car, which suffered no accidents save those that one is likely to  meet with in an afternoon's promenade. The automobile itself weighed,  with its baggage and accessories, practically six hundred kilos, and  with its two passengers 760 kilos. The distance covered was 4,496  kilometres.      Part II  Touring In France    [Illustration: Touring France]      Chapter I  Down Through Touraine: Paris To Bordeaux    As old residents of Paris we, like other automobilists, had come to  dread the twenty-five or thirty kilometres which lead from town out  through Choisy-le-Roi and Villeneuve St. Georges, at which point the  road begins to improve, and the execrable suburban Paris pavement,  second to nothing for real vileness, except that of Belgium, is  practically left behind, all but occasional bits through the towns.    At any rate, since our automobile horse was eating his head off in  the garage at St. Germain, we decided on one bright May morning to  conduct him forthwith by as comfortable a road as might be found from  St. Germain around to Choisy-le-Roi.    Getting across Paris is one of the dreaded things of life. For the  traveller by train who, fleeing from the fogs of London, as he  periodically does in droves from November to February of each year,  desires to make the south-bound connection at the Gare de Lyon, it is  something of a problem. He may board the \"_Ceinture_\" with a distrust  the whole while that his train may not make it in time, or he may go  by cab, provided he will run the risk of some of his numerous  impedimenta being left behind, for--speak it lightly--the Englishman  is still found who travels with his bath-tub, though, if he is at all  progressive, it may be a collapsible india-rubber affair which you  blow up like the tires of an automobile.    For the automobilist there is the same dread and fear. To avoid this  one has simply to make his way carefully from St. Germain, via Port  Marly, or Marly-Bailly, to St. Cyr (where is the great military  school), to Versailles, thence to Choisy-le-Roi via the _Route  Nationale_ which passes to the south of Sceaux. The route is not,  perhaps, the shortest, and it takes something of the skill of the old  pathfinders to worry it out, but it absolutely avoids the pavements  between St. Germain and Versailles and equally avoids the drive  through Paris with its attendant responsibilities.    The automobilist, once clear of Paris, has only to think of the open  road. There will be little to bother him now, save care in  negotiating the oft-times narrow, awkward turnings of an occasional  small town where, if it is market-day, untold disaster may await him  if he does not look sharp.    On the occasion of our flight south, nothing on the whole journey  happened to give us any concern, save at Pithiviers, where a  market-wagon with a staid old farm-horse--who did not mean any  harm--charged us and lifted off the right mud-guard, necessitating an  hour's work or more at the blacksmith's to straighten it out again.    [Illustration: Wayside Inn in France]    At any rate, we had covered a trifle over a hundred kilometres from  Paris, and that was something. We lunched well at the Hotel de la  Poste, and sent off to city-bound friends in the capital samples of  the lark patties for which the town is famous.    Nearly every town in France has its specialty; Pithiviers its _pate  des allouettes;_ Montelimar its _nougat_; Axat its _mousserons_;  Perigueux its _truffes_, and Tours its _rillettes_. When one buys  them away from the land of their birth he often buys dross, hence it  is a real kindness to send back eatable souvenirs of one's round,  much more kind than would be the tawdry jugs and plates emblazoned in  lurid colours, or white wood napkin-rings and card-cases, usually  gathered in as souvenirs.    It is forty-two kilometres to Orleans, one of the most historic and,  at the same time, one of the most uninteresting cities in France, a  place wholly without local dignity and distinction. Its hotels,  cafes, and shops are only second-rate for a place of its rank, and  the manners and customs of its people but weak imitations of those of  Paris. You can get anything you may need in the automobile line most  capably attended to, and you can be housed and fed comfortably enough  in either of the two leading hotels, but there is nothing inspiring  or even satisfying about it, as we knew from a half-dozen previous  occasions.    We slept that night beneath the frowning donjon walls of Beaugency's  L'Ecu de Bretagne, for something less than six francs apiece for  dinner, lodging, and morning coffee, and did not regret in the least  the twenty-five kilometres we had put between us and Orleans.    At one time it was undecided whether we should come on to Beaugency,  or put in at Meung, the attraction of the latter place being, for the  sentimentalist, that it is the scene of the opening pages of Dumas's  \"Trois Mousquetaires,\" and, in an earlier day, the cradle of Jehan de  Meung, the author of the \"Roman de la Rose.\" No evidences of Dumas's  \"Franc Meunier\" remained, and, as there was no inn with as romantic a  name as that at Beaugency, we kept on another seven kilometres.    We had made it a rule, while on the trip, not to sleep in a large  town when we could do otherwise, and that is why Orleans and Blois  and Bordeaux are mere guide-posts in our itinerary.    From Beaugency to Blois is thirty odd kilometres only, along the  flat, national highway, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26046"],[0,"Bird Stories from Burroughs (#13)"],[1,"est, how shall we get it? Does he never go  home to see how things are getting on, or to see if his presence is not  needed, or to take madam a morsel of food? No doubt he keeps within  earshot, and a cry of distress or alarm from the mother bird would bring  him to the spot in an instant. Would that some evil fate would make her  cry, then! Presently he encounters a rival. His feeding-ground infringes  upon that of another, and the two birds regard each other threateningly.  This is a good sign, for their nests are evidently near.    Their battle-cry is a low, peculiar chirp, not very fierce, but  bantering and confident. They quickly come to blows, but it is a very  fantastic battle, and, as it would seem, indulged in more to satisfy  their sense of honor than to hurt each other, for neither party gets the  better of the other, and they separate a few paces and sing, and squeak,  and challenge each other in a very happy frame of mind. The gauntlet is  no sooner thrown down than it is again taken up by one or the other, and  in the course of fifteen or twenty minutes they have three or four  encounters, separating a little, then provoked to return again like two  cocks, till finally they withdraw beyond hearing of each other,--both,  no doubt, claiming the victory. But the secret of the nest is still  kept. Once I think I have it. I catch a glimpse of a bird which looks  like the female, and near by, in a small hemlock about eight feet from  the ground, my eye detects a nest. But as I come up under it, I can see  daylight through it, and that it is empty,--evidently only partly  finished, not lined or padded yet. Now if the bird will only return and  claim it, the point will be gained. But we wait and watch in vain. The  architect has knocked off to-day, and we must come again, or continue  our search.    Despairing of finding either of the nests of the two males, we pushed on  through the woods to try our luck elsewhere. Before long, just as we  were about to plunge down a hill into a dense, swampy part of the woods,  we discovered a pair of the birds we were in quest of. They had food in  their beaks, and, as we paused, showed great signs of alarm, indicating  that the nest was in the immediate vicinity. This was enough. We would  pause here and find this nest, anyhow. To make a sure thing of it, we  determined to watch the parent birds till we had wrung from them their  secret. So we doggedly crouched down and watched them, and they watched  us. It was diamond cut diamond. But as we felt constrained in our  movements, desiring, if possible, to keep so quiet that the birds would,  after a while, see in us only two harmless stumps or prostrate logs, we  had much the worst of it. The mosquitoes were quite taken with our  quiet, and knew us from logs and stumps in a moment. Neither were the  birds deceived, not even when we tried the Indian's tactics, and plumed  ourselves with green branches. Ah, the suspicious creatures, how they  watched us with the food in their beaks, abstaining for one whole hour  from ministering to that precious charge which otherwise would have been  visited every few moments! Quite near us they would come at times,  between us and the nest, eying us so sharply. Then they would move off,  and apparently try to forget our presence. Was it to deceive us, or to  persuade himself and his mate that there was no serious cause for alarm,  that the male would now and then strike up in full song and move off to  some distance through the trees? But the mother bird did not allow  herself to lose sight of us at all, and both birds, after carrying the  food in their beaks a long time, would swallow it themselves. Then they  would obtain another morsel and apparently approach very near the nest,  when their caution or prudence would come to their aid, and they would  swallow the food and hasten away. I thought the young birds would cry  out, but not a syllable from them. Yet this was, no doubt, what kept the  parent birds away from the nest. The clamor the young would have set up  on the approach of the old with food would have exposed everything.    After a time I felt sure I knew within a few feet where the nest was  concealed. Indeed, I thought I knew the identical bush. Then the birds  approached each other again and grew very confidential about another  locality some rods below. This puzzled us, and, seeing the whole  afternoon might be spent in this manner and the mystery unsolved, we  determined to change our tactics and institute a thorough search of the  locality. This procedure soon brought things to a crisis, for, as my  companion clambered over a log by a little hemlock, a few yards from  where we had been sitting, with a cry of alarm out sprang the young  birds from their nest in the hemlock, and, scampering and fluttering  over the leaves, disappeared in different directions. Instantly the  parent birds were on the scene in an agony of alarm. Their distress was  pitiful. They threw themselves on the ground at our very feet, and  fluttered, and cried, and trailed themselves before us, to draw us away  from the place, or distract our attention from the helpless young. I  shall not forget the male bird, how bright he looked, how sharp the  contrast as he trailed his painted plumage there on the dry leaves.  Apparently he was seriously disabled. He would start up as if exerting  every muscle to fly away, but no use; down he would come, with a  helpless, fluttering motion, before he had gone two yards, and  apparently you had only to go and pick him up. But before you could pick  him up, he had recovered somewhat and flown a little farther; and thus,  if you were tempted to follow him, you would soon find yourself some  distance from the scene of the nest, and both old and young well out of  your reach. The female bird was not less solicitous, and practiced the  same arts upon us to decoy us away, but her dull plumage rendered her  less noticeable. The male was clad in holiday attire, but his mate in an  every-day working-garb.    The nest was built in the fork of a little hemlock, about fifteen inches  from the ground, and was a thick, firm structure, composed of the finer  material of the woods, with a lining of very delicate roots or rootlets.  There were four young birds and one addled egg.          THE MARSH HAWK    A MARSH HAWK'S NEST, A YOUNG HAWK, AND A VISIT TO A QUAIL ON HER NEST      Most country boys, I fancy, know the marsh hawk. It is he you see flying  low over the fields, beating about bushes and marshes and dipping over  the fences, with his attention directed to the ground beneath him. He is  a cat on wings. He keeps so low that the birds and mice do not see him  till he is fairly upon them. The hen-hawk swoops down upon the  meadow-mouse from his position high in air, or from the top of a dead  tree; but the marsh hawk stalks him and comes suddenly upon him from  over the fence, or from behind a low bush or tuft of grass. He is nearly  as large as the hen-hawk, but has a much longer tail. When I was a boy I  used to call him the long-tailed hawk. The male is of a bluish  slate-color; the female reddish-brown, like the hen-hawk, with a white  rump.    Unlike the other hawks, they nest on the ground in low, thick marshy  places. For several seasons a pair have nested in a bushy marsh a few  miles back of me, near the house of a farmer friend of mine, who has a  keen eye for the wild life about him. Two years ago he found the nest,  but when I got over to see it the next week, it had been robbed,  probably by some boys in the neighborhood. The past season, in April or  May, by watching the mother bird, he found the nest again. It was in a  marshy place, several acres in extent, in the bottom of a valley, and  thickly grown with hardback, prickly ash, smilax, and other low thorny  bushes. My friend took me to the brink of a low hill, and pointed out to  me in the marsh below us, as nearly as he could, just where the nest was  located. Then we crossed the pasture, entered upon the marsh, and made  our way cautiously toward it. The wild, thorny growths, waist-high, had  to be carefully dealt with. As we neared the spot, I used my eyes the  best I could, but I did not see the hawk till she sprang into the air  not ten yards away from us. She went screaming upward, and was soon  sailing in a circle far above us. There, on a coarse matting of twigs  and weeds, lay five snow-white eggs, a little more than half as large as  hens' eggs. My companion said the male hawk would probably soon appear  and join the female, but he did not. She kept drifting away to the east,  and was soon gone from our sight.    We presently withdrew and secreted ourselves behind the stone wall, in  hopes of seeing the mother hawk return. She appeared in the distance,  but seemed to know she was being watched, and kept away.    About ten days later we made another visit to the nest. An adventurous  young Chicago lady also wanted to see a hawk's nest, and so accompanied  us. This time three of the eggs were hatched, and as the mother hawk  sprang up, either by accident or intentionally she threw two of the  young hawks some feet from the nest. She rose up and screamed angrily.  Then, turning toward us, she came like an arrow straight at the young  lady, a bright plume in whose hat probably drew her fire. The damsel  gathered up her skirts about her and beat a hasty retreat. Hawks were  not so pretty as she thought they were. A large hawk launched at one's  face from high in the air is calculated to make one a little nervous. It  is such a fearful incline down which the bird comes, and she is aiming  exactly toward your eye. When within about thirty feet of you, she turns  upward with a rushing sound, and, mounting higher, falls toward you  again. She is only firing blank cartridges, as it were; but it usually  has the desired effect, and beats the enemy off.    After we had inspected the young hawks, a"]]]
