I was excited. Deeds of great  import must shortly be done. I felt a little nervous. It would never do  to bungle the thing. Suppose by some accident I were to drown the  professor! Or suppose that, after all, he contented himself with a mere  formal expression of thanks, and refused to let bygones be bygones.  These things did not bear thinking of.    I got up and began to pace restlessly to and fro.    Presently from the farther end of the harbour there put off Mr. Hawk's  boat, bearing its precious cargo. My mouth became dry with excitement.    Very slowly Mr. Hawk pulled round the end of the Cob, coming to a  standstill some dozen yards from where I was performing my beat. It was  evidently here that the scene of the gallant rescue had been fixed.    My eyes were glued upon Mr. Hawk's broad back. Only when going in to  bat at cricket have I experienced a similar feeling of suspense. The  boat lay almost motionless on the water. I had never seen the sea  smoother. Little ripples plashed against the side of the Cob.    It seemed as if this perfect calm might continue for ever. Mr. Hawk  made no movement. Then suddenly the whole scene changed to one of vast  activity. I heard Mr. Hawk utter a hoarse cry, and saw him plunge  violently in his seat. The professor turned half round, and I caught  sight of his indignant face, pink with emotion. Then the scene changed  again with the rapidity of a dissolving view. I saw Mr. Hawk give  another plunge, and the next moment the boat was upside down in the  water, and I was shooting headforemost to the bottom, oppressed with  the indescribably clammy sensation which comes when one's clothes are  thoroughly wet.    I rose to the surface close to the upturned boat. The first sight I saw  was the spluttering face of Mr. Hawk. I ignored him, and swam to where  the professor's head bobbed on the waters.    \"Keep cool,\" I said. A silly remark in the circumstances.    He was swimming energetically but unskilfully. He appeared to be one of  those men who can look after themselves in the water only when they are  in bathing costume. In his shore clothes it would have taken him a week  to struggle to land, if he had got there at all, which was unlikely.    I know all about saving people from drowning. We used to practise it  with a dummy in the swimming-bath at school. I attacked him from the  rear, and got a good grip of him by the shoulders. I then swam on my  back in the direction of land, and beached him with much _eclat_ at the  feet of an admiring crowd. I had thought of putting him under once or  twice just to show him he was being rescued, but decided against such a  course as needlessly realistic. As it was, I fancy he had swallowed of  sea-water two or three hearty draughts.    The crowd was enthusiastic.    \"Brave young feller,\" said somebody.    I blushed. This was Fame.    \"Jumped in, he did, sure enough, an' saved the gentleman!\"    \"Be the old soul drownded?\"    \"That girt fule, 'Arry 'Awk!\"    I was sorry for Mr. Hawk. Popular opinion was against him. What the  professor said of him, when he recovered his breath, I cannot  repeat,--not because I do not remember it, but because there is a line,  and one must draw it. Let it be sufficient to say that on the subject  of Mr. Hawk he saw eye to eye with the citizen who had described him as  a \"girt fule.\" I could not help thinking that my fellow conspirator did  well to keep out of it all. He was now sitting in the boat, which he  had restored to its normal position, baling pensively with an old tin  can. To satire from the shore he paid no attention.    The professor stood up, and stretched out his hand. I grasped it.    \"Mr. Garnet,\" he said, for all the world as if he had been the father  of the heroine of \"Hilda's Hero,\" \"we parted recently in anger. Let me  thank you for your gallant conduct and hope that bygones will be  bygones.\"    I came out strong. I continued to hold his hand. The crowd raised a  sympathetic cheer.    I said, \"Professor, the fault was mine. Show that you have forgiven me  by coming up to the farm and putting on something dry.\"    \"An excellent idea, me boy; I _am_ a little wet.\"    \"A little,\" I agreed.    We walked briskly up the hill to the farm.    Ukridge met us at the gate.    He diagnosed the situation rapidly.    \"You're all wet,\" he said. I admitted it.    \"Professor Derrick has had an unfortunate boating accident,\" I  explained.    \"And Mr. Garnet heroically dived in, in all his clothes, and saved me  life,\" broke in the professor. \"A hero, sir. A--_choo_!\"    \"You're catching cold, old horse,\" said Ukridge, all friendliness and  concern, his little differences with the professor having vanished like  thawed snow. \"This'll never do. Come upstairs and get into something of  Garnet's. My own toggery wouldn't fit. What? Come along, come along,  I'll get you some hot water. Mrs. Beale--Mrs. _Beale_! We want a large  can of hot water. At once. What? Yes, immediately. What? Very well  then, as soon as you can. Now then, Garny, my boy, out with the duds.  What do you think of this, now, professor? A sweetly pretty thing in  grey flannel. Here's a shirt. Get out of that wet toggery, and Mrs.  Beale shall dry it. Don't attempt to tell me about it till you're  changed. Socks! Socks forward. Show socks. Here you are. Coat? Try this  blazer. That's right--that's right.\"    He bustled about till the professor was clothed, then marched him  downstairs, and gave him a cigar.    \"Now, what's all this? What happened?\"    The professor explained. He was severe in his narration upon the  unlucky Mr. Hawk.    \"I was fishing, Mr. Ukridge, with me back turned, when I felt the boat  rock violently from one side to the other to such an extent that I  nearly lost me equilibrium, and then the boat upset. The man's a fool,  sir. I could not see what had happened, my back being turned, as I say.\"    \"Garnet must have seen. What happened, old horse?\"    \"It was very sudden,\" I said. \"It seemed to me as if the man had got an  attack of cramp. That would account for it. He has the reputation of  being a most sober and trustworthy fellow.\"    \"Never trust that sort of man,\" said Ukridge. \"They are always the  worst. It's plain to me that this man was beastly drunk, and upset the  boat while trying to do a dance.\"    \"A great curse, drink,\" said the professor. \"Why, yes, Mr. Ukridge, I  think I will. Thank you. Thank you. That will be enough. Not all the  soda, if you please. Ah! this tastes pleasanter than salt water, Mr.  Garnet. Eh? Eh? Ha--Ha!\"    He was in the best of tempers, and I worked strenuously to keep him so.  My scheme had been so successful that its iniquity did not worry me. I  have noticed that this is usually the case in matters of this kind. It  is the bungled crime that brings remorse.    \"We must go round the links together one of these days, Mr. Garnet,\"  said the professor. \"I have noticed you there on several occasions,  playing a strong game. I have lately taken to using a wooden putter. It  is wonderful what a difference it makes.\"    Golf is a great bond of union. We wandered about the grounds discussing  the game, the _entente cordiale_ growing more firmly established every  moment.    \"We must certainly arrange a meeting,\" concluded the professor. \"I  shall be interested to see how we stand with regard to one another. I  have improved my game considerably since I have been down here.  Considerably.\"    \"My only feat worthy of mention since I started the game,\" I said, \"has  been to halve a round with Angus M'Lurkin at St. Andrews.\"    \"_The_ M'Lurkin?\" asked the professor, impressed.    \"Yes. But it was one of his very off days, I fancy. He must have had  gout or something. And I have certainly never played so well since.\"    \"Still----,\" said the professor. \"Yes, we must really arrange to meet.\"    With Ukridge, who was in one of his less tactless moods, he became very  friendly.    Ukridge's ready agreement with his strictures on the erring Hawk had a  great deal to do with this. When a man has a grievance, he feels drawn  to those who will hear him patiently and sympathise. Ukridge was all  sympathy.    \"The man is an unprincipled scoundrel,\" he said, \"and should be torn  limb from limb. Take my advice, and don't go out with him again. Show  him that you are not a man to be trifled with. The spilt child dreads  the water, what? Human life isn't safe with such men as Hawk roaming  about.\"    \"You are perfectly right, sir. The man can have no defence. I shall not  employ him again.\"    I felt more than a little guilty while listening to this duet on the  subject of the man whom I had lured from the straight and narrow path.  But the professor would listen to no defence. My attempts at excusing  him were ill received. Indeed, the professor shewed such signs of  becoming heated that I abandoned my fellow-conspirator to his fate with  extreme promptness. After all, an addition to the stipulated  reward--one of these days--would compensate him for any loss which he  might sustain from the withdrawal of the professor's custom. Mr. Harry  Hawk was in good enough case. I would see that he did not suffer.    Filled with these philanthropic feelings, I turned once more to talk  with the professor of niblicks and approach shots and holes done in  three without a brassy. We were a merry party at lunch--a lunch  fortunately in Mrs. Beale's best vein, consisting of a roast chicken  and sweets. Chicken had figured somewhat frequently of late on our  daily bill of fare.    We saw the professor off the premises in his dried clothes, and I  turned back to put the fowls to bed in a happier frame of mind than I  had known for a long time. I whistled rag-time airs as I worked.    \"Rum old buffer,\" said Ukridge meditatively, pouring himself out  another whisky and soda. \"My goodness, I should have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38290"],[0,"Speciation and Evolution of the Pygmy Mice, Genus Baiomys (#13)"],[1,"cality_, 5700 ft., 26[16] (including the type); 15 mi.

NW Axochiapan, 3500 feet, Morelos, Republic  of Mexico, obtained on July 28, 1950, by W. B. Davis, original number  5112.    _Range._--Guerrero thence eastward into Morelos and west central Puebla  along the southern edge of the Transverse Volcanic Biotic Province  (Goldman and Moore, 1945:349), south into Oaxaca, see Figure 10. Zonal  range: largely Arid Lower Tropical Subzone of Goldman (1951:330). Occurs  from near sea level in Oaxaca and Guerrero up to 6550 feet in Oaxaca.    _Diagnosis._--Size medium for the species; dorsum Buffy Brown in palest  series to Olive-Brown in darkest series, individual hairs Warm Buff,  Neutral Gray basally, some with black tips and a subterminal band of  Warm Buff, guard hairs of dorsum black-tipped, gray basally; hairs on  sides creamy-buff, gray basally; face same color as back fading to white  on throat; vibrissae white-tipped, pale brown basally; venter, whitish  with tinges of buff on lower throat, individual hairs having tips white  to buffy-white, light gray basally; dorsal surface of forefeet and hind  feet whitish to flesh-color; tail indistinctly bicolored, brownish  above, grayish brown below; zygoma bowed as in _B. m. grisescens_; tail  short; average and extreme external and cranial measurements for 17  adults from Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, are: total length, 117.3 (110-126);  length of tail vertebrae, 46.9 (41-51); length of body, 70.4 (65-76);  length of hind foot, 15.8 (15-16); occipitonasal length, 18.9  (18.2-20.1); zygomatic breadth, 10.1 (9.7-10.6); postpalatal length, 6.9  (6.6-7.5); least interorbital breadth, 3.8 (3.6-3.9); length of incisive  foramina, 4.4 (4.2-4.7); length of rostrum, 6.7 (6.3-7.2); breadth of  braincase, 9.3 (8.7-9.7); depth of cranium, 6.6 (6.4-6.8); alveolar  length of maxillary tooth-row, 3.2 (3.1-3.4); for photographs of skull,  see Plate 1g, and Plate 3g.    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. m. brunneus_ and _B. m.  infernatis_, see accounts of those subspecies.    From _B. m. musculus_, _B. m. pallidus_ differs in: dorsum more  olive-gray and brown, less ochraceous on either side of mid-dorsal  region; face below eye grayish, not buffy; sides gray with buffy  overtone, not creamy with light yellow overtones; venter grayish-white  rather than an olive-buff; zygomata more tapering anteriorly; maxillary  part of zygoma narrower when viewed from above; external and cranial  dimensions smaller.    From _B. m. nigrescens_, _B. m. pallidus_ differs in: dorsum paler,  fewer black hairs medially; face paler, less sooty; vibrissae brownish  with white tips rather than black with brownish tips; venter paler;  dorsal surface of forefeet and hind feet whitish to flesh-colored rather  than sooty to dusky-white; tail paler; nasals slightly more attenuated;  averaging slightly larger in external and cranial measurements.    _Remarks._--Russell (1952:21) described _pallidus_, on the basis of  specimens from the arid Balsas Basin, of Morelos, as pale gray dorsally.  After examining the original material from Morelos, I find the dorsal  color of _pallidus_ to be much closer to a buffy brown than a pale  grayish. Even so, smaller size differentiates _pallidus_ from  _musculus_. _B. m. infernatis_, not _B. m. pallidus_, is the most pallid  of all named subspecies of _B. musculus_.    _B. m. pallidus_ intergrades to the northwest with _B. m. musculus_, to  the northeast with _B. m. infernatis_, and to the southeast with _B. m.  nigrescens_.    According to Goodwin (1959:2), _B. m. nebulosus_ (named on the basis of  one specimen) differs from _B. m. musculus_ [= _pallidus_] from southern  Oaxaca in: darker and longer pelage; larger skull; interorbital region  broader and less constricted posteriorly. From _B. m. nigrescens_ and  _B. m. brunneus_, _B. m. nebulosus_ differs as follows: pelage longer  and softer; skull larger.    Study of specimens of _B. musculus_ from Oaxaca reveals considerable  variation in external and cranial measurements as well as color,  corresponding to that reported by Goodwin (_loc. cit._). Specimens from  higher altitudes average somewhat darker and larger in external and  cranial size than those at lower elevations. These differences seem to  be microgeographic and not of subspecific rank. Among specimens that I  have studied in Oaxaca are several from different localities (KU 63052,  an adult male, from 3 mi. W Miahuatlan; KU 68964, an adult male from 3  mi. W Mitla, 6000 ft.; KU 63055, an adult female from 3 mi. S  Candelario, 1200 ft.) that, according to Goodwin (_in. litt._) match  _nebulosus_ in reported color, size of body and skull (except for the  region of the rostrum).    Two of the three specimens (KU 63052 and 63055) are the darkest of a  series in which the palest are inseparable from _B. m. pallidus_.  Goodwin, who kindly compared the three specimens with the type of  _nebulosus_, mentioned (_in. litt._) that the skull of the type has a  slenderer rostrum. Included in the series of skulls of _B. m. pallidus_  from 3 mi. W Mitla are several adults (not seen by Goodwin) with slender  rostra. _B. m. nebulosus_ is judged to be a synonym of _B. m. pallidus_.    Populations of pygmy mice occurring in partially isolated areas of  highland in Oaxaca seem to me to be incipient subspecies.    _Specimens examined._--Total 824 all from the Republic of Mexico and  distributed as follows: PUEBLA: 2 mi.
