I knew that the mechanism which made the stitch       must be connected with and actuated by this driving shaft. After       studying the position and relations of the needle and shaft with       each other, I conceived the idea of the revolving hook on the end       of the shaft, which might take hold of the thread and manipulate it       into a chainstitch. My ideas were, of course, very crude and       indefinite, but it will be seen that I then had the correct       conception of the invention afterwards embodied in my machine.[68]    [Illustration: Figure 39.--ONE OF THE FIRST COMMERCIAL MACHINES produced  by the Willcox & Gibbs Sewing Machine Co. in 1857, this machine bears no  serial number, although the name \"James E. A. Gibbs\" is inscribed in two  places on the cloth plate. It was used as the patent model for Gibbs'  improvement on his 1857 patent issued the following year on August 10,  1858. (Smithsonian photo P. 6393.)]    Gibbs had no immediate interest in the sewing machine other than to  satisfy his curiosity. He did not think of it again until January 1856  when he was visiting his father in Rockbridge County, Virginia. While in  a tailor's shop there, he happened to see a Singer machine. Gibbs was  very much impressed, but thought the machine entirely too heavy,  complicated, and cumbersome, and the price exorbitant. It was then that  he recalled the machine he had devised. Remembering how simple it was,  he decided to work in earnest to produce a less-expensive type of sewing  machine.    Gibbs had little time to spend on this invention since his family was  dependent upon him for support, but he managed to find time at night and  during inclement weather. In contemporary references, Gibbs is referred  to as a farmer, but since he is also reported to have had employers, it  may be surmised that he was a farmhand. In any event, his decision to  try to produce a less-expensive sewing machine suffered from a lack of  proper tools and adequate materials. Most of the machine had to be  constructed of wood, and he was forced to make his own needles. By the  end of April 1856, however, his model was sufficiently completed to  arouse the interest of his employers, who agreed to furnish the money  necessary to patent the machine.    Gibbs went to Washington, where he examined sewing-machine models in the  Patent Office and other machines then on the market. Completing his  investigations, Gibbs made a trip to Philadelphia and showed his  invention to a builder of models of new inventions, James Willcox. Much  impressed with the machine, Willcox arranged for Gibbs to work with his  son, Charles Willcox, in a small room in the rear of his shop. After  taking out two minor patents (on December 16, 1856, and January 20,  1857), Gibbs obtained his important one, U.S. patent No. 17,427 on June  2, 1857 (fig. 38). His association with Charles Willcox led to the  formation of the Willcox & Gibbs Sewing Machine Company, and they began  manufacturing chainstitch machines in 1857 (fig. 39). The machine used a  straight needle to make a chainstitch. At the forward end of the main  shaft was a hook which, as it rotated, carried the loop of  needle-thread, elongated and held it expanded while the feed moved the  cloth until the needle at the next stroke descended through the loop so  held. When the needle descended through the first loop, the point of the  hook was again in position to catch the second loop, at which time the  first loop was cast off and the second loop drawn through it, the first  loop having been drawn up against the lower edge of the cloth to form a  chain.    [Illustration: Figure 40.--A DOLPHIN sewing machine based on Clark's  patent of 1858. This design was first used by T. J. W. Robertson in  1855, but in his patent issued on May 22 of that year no claim was made  for the machine design, only for the chainstitch mechanism. The same  style was used by D. W. Clark in several of his chainstitch patents, but  he also made no claim for the design, stating that the machine \"may be  made in any desired ornamental form.\" The dolphin-style machines are all  chainstitch models of solid brass, originally gilt. Although only about  five inches long, they are full-size machines using a full-size needle.  (Smithsonian photo 45505.)]    A Gibbs sewing machine, on a simple iron-frame stand with treadle, sold  for approximately $50 in the late 1850s,[69] while a Wheeler and  Wilson[70] machine or a Grover and Baker[71] with the same type of  stand sold for approximately $100. After the introduction of the Gibbs  machine, the Singer company[72] brought out a light family machine in  1858 that was also first sold for $100. It was then reduced to $50, but  it was not popular because it was too light (see discussion of Singer  machines, pp. 34-35). In 1859, Singer brought out its second, more  successful family machine, which sold for $75.    Like the other companies licensed by the \"Combination,\" Willcox and  Gibbs company paid a royalty for the use of the patents it held.  Although the Willcox and Gibbs machine was a single-thread chainstitch  machine and the company held the Gibbs patents, the company was required  to be licensed to use the basic feed, vertical needle, and other  related patents held by the \"Sewing-Machine Combination.\"    With the approach of the Civil War, Gibbs returned to Virginia. Poor  health prevented him from taking an active part in the war, but he  worked throughout the conflict in a factory processing saltpeter for  gunpowder. Afterward, Gibbs returned to Philadelphia and found that  Willcox had faithfully protected his sewing-machine interests during his  long absence. The firm prospered, and Gibbs finally retired to Virginia  a wealthy man. Interestingly, Gibbs named the Virginia village to which  he returned in later life \"Raphine\"--derived, somewhat incorrectly, from  the Greek word \"to sew.\"    The Willcox & Gibbs Sewing Machine Company is one of the few old  companies still in existence. It discontinued making and selling  family-style machines many years ago and directed its energies toward  specialized commercial sewing machines, many of which are based on the  original chainstitch principle.    There was also an ever-increasing number of other patentees and  manufacturers who, in the late 1850s and 1860s, attempted to produce a  sewing machine that would circumvent both the \"Combination\" and the high  cost of manufacturing a more complicated type of machine. Some of the  more interesting of these are pictured and described in figures 40  through 54.    [Illustration: Figure 41.--THE CHERUB sewing machine was another  Robertson first which was adopted by Clark. Robertson's patent of  October 20, 1857, once again makes no claim for the design; neither does  Clark's patent of January 5, 1858, illustrated here. The machine is  approximately the same size as the dolphin and is made in the same  manner and of the same materials. Two cherubs form the main support, one  also supporting the spool and leashing a dragonfly which backs the  needle mechanism. (Smithsonian photo 45504-D.)]    [Illustration: Figure 42.--THE FOLIAGE SEWING MACHINE originated with D.  W. Clark. Once again he did not include the design in his June 8, 1858,  patent, which was aimed at improving the feeding mechanism. Like most  hand-turned models, these required a clamp to fasten them to the table  when in operation. (Smithsonian photo 45504-C.)]    [Illustration: Figure 43.--THE SEWING SHEARS was another popular machine  of unusual style. Some models were designed to both cut and sew, but  most derived their names from the method of motivating power. The  earliest example of the sewing-shears machine was invented by Joseph  Hendrick, who stated in his patent that he was attempting to produce \"a  simple, portable, cheap, and efficient machine.\" His patent model of  October 5, 1858, is illustrated. (Smithsonian photo 45504-F.)]    [Illustration: Figure 44.--THE HORSE SEWING MACHINE is among the most  unusual of the patents issued for mechanical improvements. Although  James Perry, the patentee, made several claims for the looper, feeder,  and tension, he made no mention of the unusual design of the machine,  for which a patent was issued on November 23, 1858. Although it was  probably one of a kind, the horse machine illustrates the extent to  which the inventor's mind struggled for original design. (Smithsonian  photo 45505-C.)]    [Illustration: Figure 45.--MANY INVENTORS attempted to cut the cost of  manufacturing a complicated machine. One of these was Albert H. Hook,  whose machine is only about four inches high and two inches wide. His  patent, granted November 30, 1858, simplified the construction and  arrangement of the various parts. Although Hook used a barbed needle  reminiscent of the one used by Thimonnier, his method of forming the  stitch was entirely different. The thread was passed through the  necessary guides, and when the cloth was in place the needle was thrust  up from below. Passing through the fabric, the needle descended,  carrying with it a loop of thread. As the process was repeated, a  chainstitch was formed with the enchained loop on the under side. In  spite of its simple mechanism, Hook's machine was not a commercial  success. (Smithsonian photo 45505-D.)]    [Illustration: Figure 46.--IN ADDITION TO MECHANICAL PATENTS, a number  of design patents were also issued for sewing machines. These fall into  a separate series in the Patent Office's numerical records. This unusual  example featured two semidraped female figures holding the spool of  thread, a mermaid holding the needle, a serpent which served as the  presser foot, and a heart-shaped baster plate. The design was patented  by W. N. Brown, October 25, 1859, but no examples other than the patent  model are known to have been made.

Having paused, however, to let the persons in the gallery pass before  she opened her door, her thoughts, in the mean time, recovered from the  confusion of sleep, and she understood that the bell was the call of  the monks to prayers. It had now ceased, and, all being again still,  she forbore to go to St. Aubert's room. Her mind was not disposed  for immediate sleep, and the moon-light, that shone into her chamber,  invited her to open the casement, and look out upon the country.    It was a still and beautiful night, the sky was unobscured by any cloud,  and scarce a leaf of the woods beneath trembled in the air. As she  listened, the mid-night hymn of the monks rose softly from a chapel,  that stood on one of the lower cliffs, an holy strain, that seemed to  ascend through the silence of night to heaven, and her thoughts ascended  with it. From the consideration of His works, her mind arose to the  adoration of the Deity, in His goodness and power; wherever she turned  her view, whether on the sleeping earth, or to the vast regions of  space, glowing with worlds beyond the reach of human thought, the  sublimity of God, and the majesty of His presence appeared. Her eyes  were filled with tears of awful love and admiration; and she felt that  pure devotion, superior to all the distinctions of human system, which  lifts the soul above this world, and seems to expand it into a nobler  nature; such devotion as can, perhaps, only be experienced, when  the mind, rescued, for a moment, from the humbleness of earthly  considerations, aspires to contemplate His power in the sublimity of His  works, and His goodness in the infinity of His blessings.         Is it not now the hour,   The holy hour, when to the cloudless height   Of yon starred concave climbs the full-orbed moon,   And to this nether world in solemn stillness,   Gives sign, that, to the list'ning ear of Heaven   Religion's voice should plead?  The very babe   Knows this, and, chance awak'd, his little hands   Lifts to the gods, and on his innocent couch   Calls down a blessing.*       *Caractacus      The midnight chant of the monks soon after dropped into silence; but  Emily remained at the casement, watching the setting moon, and the  valley sinking into deep shade, and willing to prolong her present state  of mind. At length she retired to her mattress, and sunk into tranquil  slumber.        CHAPTER V           While in the rosy vale   Love breath'd his infant sighs, from anguish free.       Thomson    St. Aubert, sufficiently restored by a night's repose to pursue his  journey, set out in the morning, with his family and Valancourt, for  Rousillon, which he hoped to reach before night-fall. The scenes,  through which they now passed, were as wild and romantic, as any they  had yet observed, with this difference, that beauty, every now and then,  softened the landscape into smiles. Little woody recesses appeared among  the mountains, covered with bright verdure and flowers; or a pastoral  valley opened its grassy bosom in the shade of the cliffs, with flocks  and herds loitering along the banks of a rivulet, that refreshed it  with perpetual green. St. Aubert could not repent the having taken this  fatiguing road, though he was this day, also, frequently obliged to  alight, to walk along the rugged precipice, and to climb the steep and  flinty mountain. The wonderful sublimity and variety of the prospects  repaid him for all this, and the enthusiasm, with which they were viewed  by his young companions, heightened his own, and awakened a remembrance  of all the delightful emotions of his early days, when the sublime  charms of nature were first unveiled to him. He found great pleasure in  conversing with Valancourt, and in listening to his ingenuous  remarks. The fire and simplicity of his manners seemed to render him  a characteristic figure in the scenes around them; and St. Aubert  discovered in his sentiments the justness and the dignity of an elevated  mind, unbiased by intercourse with the world. He perceived, that his  opinions were formed, rather than imbibed; were more the result of  thought, than of learning. Of the world he seemed to know nothing; for  he believed well of all mankind, and this opinion gave him the reflected  image of his own heart.    St. Aubert, as he sometimes lingered to examine the wild plants in his  path, often looked forward with pleasure to Emily and Valancourt, as  they strolled on together; he, with a countenance of animated delight,  pointing to her attention some grand feature of the scene; and she,  listening and observing with a look of tender seriousness, that spoke  the elevation of her mind. They appeared like two lovers who had  never strayed beyond these their native mountains; whose situation had  secluded them from the frivolities of common life, whose ideas were  simple and grand, like the landscapes among which they moved, and who  knew no other happiness, than in the union of pure and affectionate  hearts. St. Aubert smiled, and sighed at the romantic picture of  felicity his fancy drew; and sighed again to think, that nature and  simplicity were so little known to the world, as that their pleasures  were thought romantic.    'The world,' said he, pursuing this train of thought, 'ridicules a  passion which it seldom feels; its scenes, and its interests, distract  the mind, deprave the taste, corrupt the heart, and love cannot exist  in a heart that has lost the meek dignity of innocence. Virtue and taste  are nearly the same, for virtue is little more than active taste, and  the most delicate affections of each combine in real love. How then are  we to look for love in great cities, where selfishness, dissipation, and  insincerity supply the place of tenderness, simplicity and truth?'    It was near noon, when the travellers, having arrived at a piece of  steep and dangerous road, alighted to walk. The road wound up an ascent,  that was clothed with wood, and, instead of following the carriage, they  entered the refreshing shade. A dewy coolness was diffused upon the air,  which, with the bright verdure of turf, that grew under the trees, the  mingled fragrance of flowers and of balm, thyme, and lavender, that  enriched it, and the grandeur of the pines, beech, and chestnuts, that  overshadowed them, rendered this a most delicious retreat. Sometimes,  the thick foliage excluded all view of the country; at others, it  admitted some partial catches of the distant scenery, which gave  hints to the imagination to picture landscapes more interesting, more  impressive, than any that had been presented to the eye. The wanderers  often lingered to indulge in these reveries of fancy.    The pauses of silence, such as had formerly interrupted the  conversations of Valancourt and Emily, were more frequent today than  ever. Valancourt often dropped suddenly from the most animating vivacity  into fits of deep musing, and there was, sometimes, an unaffected  melancholy in his smile, which Emily could not avoid understanding, for  her heart was interested in the sentiment it spoke.    St. Aubert was refreshed by the shades, and they continued to saunter  under them, following, as nearly as they could guess, the direction of  the road, till they perceived that they had totally lost it. They had  continued near the brow of the precipice, allured by the scenery  it exhibited, while the road wound far away over the cliff above.  Valancourt called loudly to Michael, but heard no voice, except his own,  echoing among the rocks, and his various efforts to regain the road were  equally unsuccessful. While they were thus circumstanced, they perceived  a shepherd's cabin, between the boles of the trees at some distance, and  Valancourt bounded on first to ask assistance. When he reached it, he  saw only two little children, at play, on the turf before the door. He  looked into the hut, but no person was there, and the eldest of the boys  told him that their father was with his flocks, and their mother was  gone down into the vale, but would be back presently. As he stood,  considering what was further to be done, on a sudden he heard Michael's  voice roaring forth most manfully among the cliffs above, till he  made their echoes ring. Valancourt immediately answered the call, and  endeavoured to make his way through the thicket that clothed the steeps,  following the direction of the sound. After much struggle over brambles  and precipices, he reached Michael, and at length prevailed with him to  be silent, and to listen to him. The road was at a considerable distance  from the spot where St. Aubert and Emily were; the carriage could not  easily return to the entrance of the wood, and, since it would be very  fatiguing for St. Aubert to climb the long and steep road to the place  where it now stood, Valancourt was anxious to find a more easy ascent,  by the way he had himself passed.    Meanwhile St. Aubert and Emily approached the cottage, and rested  themselves on a rustic bench, fastened between two pines, which  overshadowed it, till Valancourt, whose steps they had observed, should  return.    The eldest of the children desisted from his play, and stood still to  observe the strangers, while the younger continued his little gambols,  and teased his brother to join in them. St. Aubert looked with pleasure  upon this picture of infantine simplicity, till it brought to his  remembrance his own boys, whom he had lost about the age of these, and  their lamented mother; and he sunk into a thoughtfulness, which Emily  observing, she immediately began to sing one of those simple and lively  airs he was so fond of, and which she knew how to give with the most  captivating sweetness. St. Aubert smiled on her through his tears, took  her hand and pressed it affectionately, and then tried to dissipate the  melancholy"]]]
