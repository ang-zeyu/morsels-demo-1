On the right, most curiously, a long strange  spit of sand runs in a causeway far across the shallows of the bay, with  the open sea on one hand, and vast, end-of-the-world lagoons on the  other. There are peaky, dark mountains beyond this--just as across the  vast bay are gloomy hills. It is a strange, strange landscape: as if  here the world left off. The bay is vast in itself; and all these  curious things happening at its head: this curious, craggy-studded town,  like a great stud of house-covered rock jutting up out of the bay flats:  around it on one side the weary, Arab-looking palm-desolated malarial  plain, and on the other side great salt lagoons, dead beyond the  sand-bar: these backed again by serried, clustered mountains, suddenly,  while away beyond the plain, hills rise to sea again. Land and sea both  seem to give out, exhausted, at the bay head: the world's end. And into  this world's end starts up Cagliari, and on either side, sudden,  serpent-crest hills.    But it still reminds me of Malta: lost between Europe and Africa and  belonging to nowhere. Belonging to nowhere, never having belonged to  anywhere. To Spain and the Arabs and the Phoenicians most. But as if  it had never really had a fate. No fate. Left outside of time and  history.    The spirit of the place is a strange thing. Our mechanical age tries to  override it. But it does not succeed. In the end the strange, sinister  spirit of the place, so diverse and adverse in differing places, will  smash our mechanical oneness into smithereens, and all that we think the  real thing will go off with a pop, and we shall be left staring.           *       *       *       *       *    On the great parapet above the Municipal Hall and above the corkscrew  high-street a thick fringe of people is hanging, looking down. We go to  look too: and behold, below there is the entrance to the ball. Yes,  there is a china shepherdess in pale blue and powdered hair, crook,  ribbons, Marie Antoinette satin daintiness and all, slowly and  haughtily walking up the road, and gazing superbly round. She is not  more than twelve years old, moreover. Two servants accompany her. She  gazes supremely from right to left as she goes, mincingly, and I would  give her the prize for haughtiness. She is perfect--a little too haughty  for Watteau, but \"marquise\" to a T. The people watch in silence. There  is no yelling and screaming and running. They watch in a suitable  silence.    Comes a carriage with two fat bay horses slithering, almost swimming up  the corkscrew high-street. That in itself is a \"tour-de-force\": for  Cagliari doesn't have carriages. Imagine a street like a corkscrew  stair, paved with slippery stone. And imagine two bay horses rowing  their way up it: they did not walk a single stride. But they arrived.  And there fluttered out three strangely exquisite children, two frail,  white satin Pierrots and a white satin Pierrette. They were like fragile  winter butterflies with black spots. They had a curious, indefinable  remote elegance, something conventional and \"fin-de-siecle\". But not our  century. The wonderful artificial delicacy of the eighteenth. The boys  had big, perfect ruffs round their necks: and behind were slung old,  cream-colored Spanish shawls, for warmth. They were frail as tobacco  flowers, and with remote, cold elegance they fluttered by the carriage,  from which emerged a large black-satin Mama. Fluttering their queer  little butterfly feet on the pavement, hovering round the large Mama  like three frail-tissued ghosts, they found their way past the solid,  seated Carabinieri into the hall.    Arrived a primrose-brocade beau, with ruffles, and his hat under his  arm: about twelve years old. Walking statelily, without a qualm up the  steep twist of the street. Or perhaps so perfect in his  self-consciousness that it became an elegant \"aplomb\" in him. He was a  genuine eighteenth-century exquisite, rather stiffer than the French,  maybe, but completely in the spirit. Curious, curious children! They had  a certain stand-offish superbness, and not a single trace of misgiving.  For them, their \"noblesse\" was indisputable. For the first time in my  life I recognized the true cold superbness of the old \"noblesse\". They  had not a single qualm about their own perfect representing of the  higher order of being.    Followed another white satin \"marquise\", with a maid-servant. They are  strong on the eighteenth century in Cagliari. Perhaps it is the last  bright reality to them. The nineteenth hardly counts.           *       *       *       *       *    Curious the children in Cagliari. The poor seem thoroughly  poor-bare-footed urchins, gay and wild in the narrow dark streets. But  the more well-to-do children are so fine: so extraordinarily elegantly  dressed. It quite strikes one of a heap. Not so much the grown-ups. The  children. All the \"chic,\" all the fashion, all the originality is  expended on the children. And with a great deal of success. Better than  Kensington Gardens very often. And they promenade with Papa and Mama  with such alert assurance, having quite brought it off, their  fashionable get-up. Who would have expected it?           *       *       *       *       *    Oh narrow, dark, and humid streets going up to the Cathedral, like  crevices. I narrowly miss a huge pail of slop-water which comes crashing  down from heaven. A small boy who was playing in the street, and whose  miss is not quite a clean miss, looks up with that naive, impersonal  wonder with which children stare at a star or a lamp-lighter.    The Cathedral must have been a fine old pagan stone fortress once. Now  it has come, as it were, through the mincing machine of the ages, and  oozed out baroque and sausagey, a bit like the horrible baldachins in  St. Peter's at Rome. None the less it is homely and hole-and-cornery,  with a rather ragged high mass trailing across the pavement towards the  high altar, since it is almost sunset, and Epiphany. It feels as if one  might squat in a corner and play marbles and eat bread and cheese and be  at home: a comfortable old-time churchey feel.    There is some striking filet lace on the various altar-cloths. And St.  Joseph must be a prime saint. He has an altar and a verse of invocation  praying for the dying.    \"Oh, St. Joseph, true potential father of Our Lord.\" What can it profit  a man, I wonder, to be the potential father of anybody! For the rest I  am not Baedeker.           *       *       *       *       *    The top of Cagliari is the fortress: the old gate, the old ramparts, of  honey-combed, fine yellowish sandstone. Up in a great sweep goes the  rampart wall, Spanish and splendid, dizzy. And the road creeping down  again at the foot, down the back of the hill. There lies the country:  that dead plain with its bunch of palms and a fainting sea, and inland  again, hills. Cagliari must be on a single, loose, lost bluff of rock.    From the terrace just below the fortress, above the town, not behind it,  we stand and look at the sunset. It is all terrible, taking place beyond  the knotted, serpent-crested hills that lie, bluey and velvety, beyond  the waste lagoons. Dark, sultry, heavy crimson the west is, hanging  sinisterly, with those gloomy blue cloud-bars and cloud-banks drawn  across. All behind the blue-gloomy peaks stretches the curtain of  sinister, smouldering red, and away to the sea. Deep below lie the  sea-meres. They seem miles and miles, and utterly waste. But the  sand-bar crosses like a bridge, and has a road. All the air is dark, a  sombre bluish tone. The great west burns inwardly, sullenly, and gives  no glow, yet a deep red. It is cold.    We go down the steep streets, smelly, dark, dank, and very cold. No  wheeled vehicle can scramble up them, presumably. People live in one  room. Men are combing their hair or fastening their collars in the  doorways. Evening is here, and it is a feast day.           *       *       *       *       *    At the bottom of the street we come to a little bunch of masked youths,  one in a long yellow frock and a frilled bonnet, another like an old  woman, another in red twill. They are arm in arm and are accosting the  passers-by. The q-b gives a cry, and looks for escape. She has a terror  of maskers, a terror that comes from childhood. To say the truth, so  have I. We hasten invisibly down the far side of the street, and come  out under the bastions. Then we go down our own familiar wide, short,  cold boulevard to the sea.    At the bottom, again, is a carriage with more maskers. Carnival is  beginning. A man dressed as a peasant woman in native costume is  clambering with his great wide skirts and wide strides on to the box,  and, flourishing his ribboned whip, is addressing a little crowd of  listeners. He opens his mouth wide and goes on with a long yelling  harangue of taking a drive with his mother--another man in old-woman's  gaudy finery and wig who sits already bobbing on the box. The would-be  daughter flourishes, yells, and prances up there on the box of the  carriage. The crowd listens attentively and mildly smiles. It all seems  real to them. The q-b hovers in the distance, half-fascinated, and  watches. With a great flourish of whip and legs--showing his frilled  drawers--the masker pulls round to drive along the boulevard by the  sea--the only place where one can drive.           *       *       *       *       *    The big street by the sea is the Via Roma. It has the cafes on one side  and across the road the thick tufts of trees intervening between the sea  and us. Among these thick tufts of sea-front trees the little steam  tram, like a little train, bumps to rest, after having wound round the  back of the town.    The Via Roma is all social Cagliari. Including the cafes with their  outdoor tables on the one side of the road, and the avenue strand on the  other, it is very wide, and at evening it contains the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3721"],[0,"France and England in North America, Part I: Pioneers of France in the New World (#13)"],[1,"control them;  that the French were in danger; and that he had seen arrows stuck in  the ground by the side of the path, in token that war was declared. The  peril was thickening hourly, and Ottigny resolved to regain the boats  while there was yet time.    On the twenty-seventh of July, at nine in the morning, he set his men in  order. Each shouldering a sack of corn, they marched through the rows  of huts that surrounded the great lodge, and out betwixt the overlapping  extremities of the palisade that encircled the town. Before them  stretched a wide avenue, three or four hundred paces long, flanked by  a natural growth of trees,--one of those curious monuments of native  industry to which allusion has already been made. Here Ottigny halted  and formed his line of march. Arlac, with eight matchlock men, was sent  in advance, and flanking parties were thrown into the woods on either  side. Ottigny told his soldiers that, if the Indians meant to attack  them, they were probably in ambush at the other end of the avenue. He  was right. As Arlac's party reached the spot, the whole pack gave  tongue at once. The war-whoop rose, and a tempest of stone-headed arrows  clattered against the breast-plates of the French, or, scorching like  fire, tore through their unprotected limbs. They stood firm, and sent  back their shot so steadily that several of the assailants were laid  dead, and the rest, two or three hundred in number, gave way as Ottigny  came up with his men.    They moved on for a quarter of a mile through a country, as it seems,  comparatively open, when again the war-cry pealed in front, and three  hundred savages bounded to the assault. Their whoops were echoed from  the rear. It was the party whom Arlac had just repulsed, and who,  leaping and showering their arrows, were rushing on again with a  ferocity restrained only by their lack of courage. There was no panic  among the French. The men threw down their bags of corn, and took  to their weapons. They blew their matches, and, under two excellent  officers, stood well to their work. The Indians, on their part, showed  good discipline after their fashion, and were perfectly under the  control of their chiefs. With cries that imitated the yell of owls, the  scream of cougars, and the howl of wolves, they ran up in successive  bands, let fly their arrows, and instantly fell back, giving place to  others. At the sight of the leveled arquebuse, they dropped flat on the  ground. Whenever the French charged upon them, sword in hand, they fled  through the woods like foxes; and whenever the march was resumed, the  arrows were showering again upon the flanks and rear of the retiring  band. As they fell, the soldiers picked them up and broke them. Thus,  beset with swarming savages, the handful of Frenchmen pushed slowly  onward, fighting as they went.    The Indians gradually drew off, and the forest was silent again. Two of  the French had been killed and twenty-two wounded, several so severely  that they were supported to the boats with the utmost difficulty. Of the  corn, two bags only had been brought off.    Famine and desperation now reigned at Fort Caroline. The Indians had  killed two of the carpenters; hence long delay in the finishing of  the new ship. They would not wait, but resolved to put to sea in the  \"Breton\" and the brigantine. The problem was to find food for the  voyage; for now, in their extremity, they roasted and ate snakes, a  delicacy in which the neighborhood abounded.    On the third of August, Laudonniere, perturbed and oppressed, was  walking on the hill, when, looking seaward, he saw a sight that sent a  thrill through his exhausted frame. A great ship was standing towards  the river's mouth. Then another came in sight, and another, and another.  He despatched a messenger with the tidings to the fort below. The  languid forms of his sick and despairing men rose and danced for joy,  and voices shrill with weakness joined in wild laughter and acclamation,  insomuch, he says, \"that one would have thought them to bee out of their  wittes.\"    A doubt soon mingled with their joy. Who were the strangers? Were they  the friends so long hoped for in vain? or were they Spaniards, their  dreaded enemies? They were neither. The foremost ship was a stately one,  of seven hundred tons, a great burden at that day. She was named the  \"Jesus;\" and with her were three smaller vessels, the \"Solomon,\" the  \"Tiger,\" and the \"Swallow.\" Their commander was \"a right worshipful  and valiant knight,\"--for so the record styles him,--a pious man and a  prudent, to judge him by the orders he gave his crew when, ten months  before, he sailed out of Plymouth: \"Serve God daily, love one another,  preserve your victuals, beware of fire, and keepe good companie.\"  Nor were the crew unworthy the graces of their chief; for the devout  chronicler of the voyage ascribes their deliverance from the perils of  the sea to \"the Almightie God, who never suffereth his Elect to perish.\"    Who then were they, this chosen band, serenely conscious of a special  Providential care? They were the pioneers of that detested traffic  destined to inoculate with its infection nations yet unborn, the parent  of discord and death, filling half a continent with the tramp of armies  and the clash of fratricidal swords. Their chief was Sir John Hawkins,  father of the English slave-trade.    He had been to the coast of Guinea, where he bought and kidnapped  a cargo of slaves. These he had sold to the jealous Spaniards of  Hispaniola, forcing them, with sword, matchlock, and culverin, to grant  him free trade, and then to sign testimonials that he had borne himself  as became a peaceful merchant. Prospering greatly by this summary  commerce, but distressed by the want of water, he had put into the River  of May to obtain a supply.    Among the rugged heroes of the British marine, Sir John stood in the  front rank, and along with Drake, his relative, is extolled as \"a man  borne for the honour of the English name.... Neither did the West of  England yeeld such an Indian Neptunian paire as were these two Ocean  peeres, Hawkins and Drake.\" So writes the old chronicler, Purchas, and  all England was of his thinking. A hardy and skilful seaman, a bold  fighter, a loyal friend and a stern enemy, overbearing towards equals,  but kind, in his bluff way, to those beneath him, rude in speech,  somewhat crafty withal and avaricious, he buffeted his way to riches  and fame, and died at last full of years and honor. As for the abject  humanity stowed between the reeking decks of the ship \"Jesus,\" they were  merely in his eyes so many black cattle tethered for the market. [18]    Hawkins came up the river in a pinnace, and landed at Fort Caroline,  accompanied, says Laudonniere, \"with gentlemen honorably apparelled,  yet unarmed.\" Between the Huguenots and the English Puritans there was  a double tie of sympathy. Both hated priests, and both hated Spaniards.  Wakening from their apathetic misery, the starveling garrison hailed  him as a deliverer. Yet Hawkins secretly rejoiced when he learned their  purpose to abandon Florida; for although, not to tempt his cupidity,  they hid from him the secret of their Appalachian gold mine, he coveted  for his royal mistress the possession of this rich domain. He shook his  head, however, when he saw the vessels in which they proposed to embark,  and offered them all a free passage to France in his own ships. This,  from obvious motives of honor and prudence, Laudonniere declined, upon  which Hawkins offered to lend or sell to him one of his smaller vessels.    Laudonniere hesitated, and hereupon arose a great clamor. A mob of  soldiers and artisans beset his chamber, threatening loudly to desert  him, and take passage with Hawkins, unless the offer were accepted. The  commandant accordingly resolved to buy the vessel. The generous slaver,  whose reputed avarice nowhere appears in the transaction, desired him to  set his own price; and, in place of money, took the cannon of the fort,  with other articles now useless to their late owners. He sent them, too,  a gift of wine and biscuit, and supplied them with provisions for the  voyage, receiving in payment Laudonniere's note; \"for which,\" adds the  latter, \"untill this present I am indebted to him.\" With a friendly  leave taking, he returned to his ships and stood out to sea, leaving  golden opinions among the grateful inmates of Fort Caroline.    Before the English top-sails had sunk beneath the horizon, the colonists  bestirred themselves to depart. In a few days their preparations were  made. They waited only for a fair wind. It was long in coming, and  meanwhile their troubled fortunes assumed a new phase.    On the twenty eighth of August, the two captains Vasseur and Verdier  came in with tidings of an approaching squadron. Again the fort was  wild with excitement. Friends or foes, French or Spaniards, succor  or death,--betwixt these were their hopes and fears divided. On the  following morning, they saw seven barges rowing up the river, bristling  with weapons, and crowded with men in armor. The sentries on the bluff  challenged, and received no answer. One of them fired at the advancing  boats, and still there was no response. Laudonniere was almost  defenceless. He had given his heavier cannon to Hawkins, and only two  field-pieces were left. They were levelled at the foremost boats, and  the word to fire was about to be given, when a voice from among the  strangers called out that they were French, commanded by Jean Ribaut.    At the eleventh hour, the long looked for succors were come. Ribaut had  been commissioned to sail with seven ships for Florida. A disorderly  concourse of disbanded soldiers, mixed with artisans and their families,  and young nobles weary of a two years' peace, were mustered at the port  of Dieppe, and embarked, to the number of three hundred men, bearing  with them all"]]]
