When he had said this, by the advice of his  friends, he sent for Abraham, and bid him not to be concerned about his  wife, or fear the corruption of her chastity; for that God took care of  him, and that it was by his providence that he received his wife again,  without her suffering any abuse. And he appealed to God, and to his  wife's conscience; and said that he had not any inclination at first to  enjoy her, if he had known she was his wife; but since, said he, thou  leddest her about as thy sister, I was guilty of no offense. He also  entreated him to be at peace with him, and to make God propitious to  him; and that if he thought fit to continue with him, he should have  what he wanted in abundance; but that if he designed to go away, he  should be honorably conducted, and have whatsoever supply he wanted when  he came thither. Upon his saying this, Abraham told him that his  pretense of kindred to his wife was no lie, because she was his  brother's daughter; and that he did not think himself safe in his  travels abroad, without this sort of dissimulation; and that he was not  the cause of his distemper, but was only solicitous for his own safety:  he said also, that he was ready to stay with him. Whereupon Abimelech  assigned him land and money; and they coventanted to live together  without guile, and took an oath at a certain well called Beersheba,  which may be interpreted, The Well of the Oath: and so it is named by  the people of the country unto this day.    2. Now in a little time Abraham had a son by Sarah, as God had foretold  to him, whom he named Isaac, which signifies Laughter. And indeed they  so called him, because Sarah laughed when God 25 said that she should  bear a son, she not expecting such a thing, as being past the age of  child-bearing, for she was ninety years old, and Abraham a hundred; so  that this son was born to them both in the last year of each of those  decimal numbers. And they circumcised him upon the eighth day and from  that time the Jews continue the custom of circumcising their sons within  that number of days. But as for the Arabians, they circumcise after the  thirteenth year, because Ismael, the founder of their nation, who was  born to Abraham of the concubine, was circumcised at that age;  concerning whom I will presently give a particular account, with great  exactness.    3. As for Sarah, she at first loved Ismael, who was born of her own  handmaid Hagar, with an affection not inferior to that of her own son,  for he was brought up in order to succeed in the government; but when  she herself had borne Isaac, she was not willing that Ismael should be  brought up with him, as being too old for him, and able to do him  injuries when their father should be dead; she therefore persuaded  Abraham to send him and his mother to some distant country. Now, at the  first, he did not agree to what Sarah was so zealous for, and thought it  an instance of the greatest barbarity, to send away a young child 26 and  a woman unprovided of necessaries; but at length he agreed to it,  because God was pleased with what Sarah had determined: so he delivered  Ismael to his mother, as not yet able to go by himself; and commanded  her to take a bottle of water, and a loaf of bread, and so to depart,  and to take Necessity for her guide. But as soon as her necessary  provisions failed, she found herself in an evil case; and when the water  was almost spent, she laid the young child, who was ready to expire,  under a fig-tree, and went on further, that so he might die while she  was absent. But a Divine Angel came to her, and told her of a fountain  hard by, and bid her take care, and bring up the child, because she  should be very happy by the preservation of Ismael. She then took  courage, upon the prospect of what was promised her, and, meeting with  some shepherds, by their care she got clear of the distresses she had  been in.    4. When the lad was grown up, he married a wife, by birth an Egyptian,  from whence the mother was herself derived originally. Of this wife were  born to Ismael twelve sons; Nabaioth, Kedar, Abdeel, Mabsam, Idumas,  Masmaos, Masaos, Chodad, Theman, Jetur, Naphesus, Cadmas. These  inhabited all the country from Euphrates to the Red Sea, and called it  Nabatene. They are an Arabian nation, and name their tribes from these,  both because of their own virtue, and because of the dignity of Abraham  their father.              CHAPTER 13. Concerning Isaac The Legitimate Son Of Abraham.    1. Now Abraham greatly loved Isaac, as being his only begotten 27 and  given to him at the borders of old age, by the favor of God. The child  also endeared himself to his parents still more, by the exercise of  every virtue, and adhering to his duty to his parents, and being zealous  in the worship of God. Abraham also placed his own happiness in this  prospect, that, when he should die, he should leave this his son in a  safe and secure condition; which accordingly he obtained by the will of  God: who being desirous to make an experiment of Abraham's religious  disposition towards himself, appeared to him, and enumerated all the  blessings he had bestowed on him; how he had made him superior to his  enemies; and that his son Isaac, who was the principal part of his  present happiness, was derived from him; and he said that he required  this son of his as a sacrifice and holy oblation. Accordingly he  commanded him to carry him to the mountain Moriah, and to build an  altar, and offer him for a burnt-offering upon it for that this would  best manifest his religious disposition towards him, if he preferred  what was pleasing to God, before the preservation of his own son.    2. Now Abraham thought that it was not right to disobey God in any  thing, but that he was obliged to serve him in every circumstance of  life, since all creatures that live enjoy their life by his providence,  and the kindness he bestows on them. Accordingly he concealed this  command of God, and his own intentions about the slaughter of his son,  from his wife, as also from every one of his servants, otherwise he  should have been hindered from his obedience to God; and he took Isaac,  together with two of his servants, and laying what things were necessary  for a sacrifice upon an ass, he went away to the mountain. Now the two  servants went along with him two days; but on the third day, as soon as  he saw the mountain, he left those servants that were with him till then  in the plain, and, having his son alone with him, he came to the  mountain. It was that mountain upon which king David afterwards built  the temple. 28 Now they had brought with them every thing necessary for  a sacrifice, excepting the animal that was to be offered only. Now Isaac  was twenty-five years old. And as he was building the altar, he asked  his father what he was about to offer, since there was no animal there  for an oblation:Â—to which it was answered, \"That God would provide  himself an oblation, he being able to make a plentiful provision for men  out of what they have not, and to deprive others of what they already  have, when they put too much trust therein; that therefore, if God  pleased to be present and propitious at this sacrifice, he would provide  himself an oblation.\"    3. As soon as the altar was prepared, and Abraham had laid on the wood,  and all things were entirely ready, he said to his son, \"O son, I poured  out a vast number of prayers that I might have thee for my son; when  thou wast come into the world, there was nothing that could contribute  to thy support for which I was not greatly solicitous, nor any thing  wherein I thought myself happier than to see thee grown up to man's  estate, and that I might leave thee at my death the successor to my  dominion; but since it was by God's will that I became thy father, and  it is now his will that I relinquish thee, bear this consecration to God  with a generous mind; for I resign thee up to God who has thought fit  now to require this testimony of honor to himself, on account of the  favors he hath conferred on me, in being to me a supporter and defender.  Accordingly thou, my son, wilt now die, not in any common way of going  out of the world, but sent to God, the Father of all men, beforehand, by  thy own father, in the nature of a sacrifice. I suppose he thinks thee  worthy to get clear of this world neither by disease, neither by war,  nor by any other severe way, by which death usually comes upon men, but  so that he will receive thy soul with prayers and holy offices of  religion, and will place thee near to himself, and thou wilt there be to  me a succorer and supporter in my old age; on which account I  principally brought thee up, and thou wilt thereby procure me God for my  Comforter instead of thyself.\"    4. Now Isaac was of such a generous disposition as became the son of  such a father, and was pleased with this discourse; and said, \"That he  was not worthy to be born at first, if he should reject the  determination of God and of his father, and should not resign himself up  readily to both their pleasures; since it would have been unjust if he  had not obeyed, even if his father alone had so resolved.\" So he went  immediately to the altar to be sacrificed. And the deed had been done if  God had not opposed it; for he called loudly to Abraham by his name, and  forbade him to slay his son; and said, \"It was not out of a desire of  human blood that he was commanded to slay his son, nor was he willing  that he should be taken away from him whom he had made his father, but  to try the temper of his mind, whether he would be obedient to such a  command. Since therefore he now was satisfied as to that his alacrity,  and the surprising"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2849"],[0,"Against Apion (#13)"],[1,"passion than ordinary, and that by consequence he does not hear  reason with his usual fairness and impartiality; he seems to depart  sometimes from the brevity and sincerity of a faithful historian, which  is his grand character, and indulges the prolixity and colors of a  pleader and a disputant: accordingly, I confess, I always read these  sections with less pleasure than I do the rest of his writings, though  I fully believe the reproaches cast on the Jews, which he here endeavors  to confute and expose, were wholly groundless and unreasonable.    [23] This is a very valuable testimony of Manetho, that the laws of  Osarsiph, or Moses, were not made in compliance with, but in opposition  to, the customs of the Egyptians. See the note on Antiq. B. III. ch. 8.  sect. 9.    [24] By way of irony, I suppose.    [25] Here we see that Josephus esteemed a generation between Joseph  and Moses to be about forty-two or forty-three years; which, if taken  between the earlier children, well agrees with the duration of human  life in those ages. See Antheat. Rec. Part II. pages 966, 1019, 1020.    [26] That is the meaning of Hierosyla in Greek, not in Hebrew.          BOOK II.      1. In the former book, most honored Epaphroditus, I have demonstrated  our antiquity, and confirmed the truth of what I have said, from the  writings of the Phoenicians, and Chaldeans, and Egyptians. I have,  moreover, produced many of the Grecian writers as witnesses thereto.  I have also made a refutation of Manetho and Cheremon, and of certain  others of our enemies. I shall now [1] therefore begin a confutation of  the remaining authors who have written any thing against us; although  I confess I have had a doubt upon me about Apion [2] the grammarian,  whether I ought to take the trouble of confuting him or not; for some  of his writings contain much the same accusations which the others have  laid against us, some things that he hath added are very frigid and  contemptible, and for the greatest part of what he says, it is very  scurrilous, and, to speak no more than the plain truth, it shows him  to be a very unlearned person, and what he lays together looks like the  work of a man of very bad morals, and of one no better in his whole  life than a mountebank. Yet, because there are a great many men so very  foolish, that they are rather caught by such orations than by what  is written with care, and take pleasure in reproaching other men, and  cannot abide to hear them commended, I thought it to be necessary not  to let this man go off without examination, who had written such an  accusation against us, as if he would bring us to make an answer in open  court. For I also have observed, that many men are very much delighted  when they see a man who first began to reproach another, to be himself  exposed to contempt on account of the vices he hath himself been  guilty of. However, it is not a very easy thing to go over this man's  discourse, nor to know plainly what he means; yet does he seem, amidst a  great confusion and disorder in his falsehoods, to produce, in the first  place, such things as resemble what we have examined already, and relate  to the departure of our forefathers out of Egypt; and, in the second  place, he accuses those Jews that are inhabitants of Alexandria; as, in  the third place, he mixes with those things such accusations as concern  the sacred purifications, with the other legal rites used in the temple.    2. Now although I cannot but think that I have already demonstrated,  and that abundantly more than was necessary, that our fathers were not  originally Egyptians, nor were thence expelled, either on account  of bodily diseases, or any other calamities of that sort; yet will I  briefly take notice of what Apion adds upon that subject; for in his  third book, which relates to the affairs of Egypt, he speaks thus: \"I  have heard of the ancient men of Egypt, that Moses was of Heliopolis,  and that he thought himself obliged to follow the customs of his  forefathers, and offered his prayers in the open air, towards the city  walls; but that he reduced them all to be directed towards sun-rising,  which was agreeable to the situation of Heliopolis; that he also set  up pillars instead of gnomons, [3] under which was represented a cavity  like that of a boat, and the shadow that fell from their tops fell down  upon that cavity, that it might go round about the like course as the  sun itself goes round in the other.\" This is that wonderful relation  which we have given us by this grammarian. But that it is a false one  is so plain, that it stands in need of few words to prove it, but  is manifest from the works of Moses; for when he erected the first  tabernacle to God, he did himself neither give order for any such kind  of representation to be made at it, nor ordain that those that came  after him should make such a one. Moreover, when in a future age Solomon  built his temple in Jerusalem, he avoided all such needless decorations  as Apion hath here devised. He says further, how he had \"heard of the  ancient men, that Moses was of Hellopolis.\" To be sure that was, because  being a younger man himself, he believed those that by their elder age  were acquainted and conversed with him. Now this grammarian, as he was,  could not certainly tell which was the poet Homer's country, no  more than he could which was the country of Pythagoras, who lived  comparatively but a little while ago; yet does he thus easily determine  the age of Moses, who preceded them such a vast number of years, as  depending on his ancient men's relation, which shows how notorious a  liar he was. But then as to this chronological determination of the time  when he says he brought the leprous people, the blind, and the lame out  of Egypt, see how well this most accurate grammarian of ours agrees with  those that have written before him! Manetho says that the Jews departed  out of Egypt, in the reign of Tethmosis, three hundred ninety-three  years before Danaus fled to Argos; Lysimaehus says it was under king  Bocchoris, that is, one thousand seven hundred years ago; Molo and some  others determined it as every one pleased: but this Apion of ours, as  deserving to be believed before them, hath determined it exactly to have  been in the seventh olympiad, and the first year of that olympiad;  the very same year in which he says that Carthage was built by the  Phoenicians. The reason why he added this building of Carthage was,  to be sure, in order, as he thought, to strengthen his assertion by  so evident a character of chronology. But he was not aware that this  character confutes his assertion; for if we may give credit to the  Phoenician records as to the time of the first coming of their colony  to Carthage, they relate that Hirom their king was above a hundred and  fifty years earlier than the building of Carthage; concerning whom I  have formerly produced testimonials out of those Phoenician records, as  also that this Hirom was a friend of Solomon when he was building the  temple of Jerusalem, and gave him great assistance in his building that  temple; while still Solomon himself built that temple six hundred and  twelve years after the Jews came out of Egypt. As for the number of  those that were expelled out of Egypt, he hath contrived to have the  very same number with Lysimaehus, and says they were a hundred and ten  thousand. He then assigns a certain wonderful and plausible occasion for  the name of Sabbath; for he says that \"when the Jews had traveled a six  days' journey, they had buboes in their groins; and that on this account  it was that they rested on the seventh day, as having got safely to that  country which is now called Judea; that then they preserved the language  of the Egyptians, and called that day the Sabbath, for that malady of  buboes on their groin was named Sabbatosis by the Egyptians.\" And  would not a man now laugh at this fellow's trifling, or rather hate his  impudence in writing thus? We must, it seems, fake it for granted that  all these hundred and ten thousand men must have these buboes. But,  for certain, if those men had been blind and lame, and had all sorts of  distempers upon them, as Apion says they had, they could not have gone  one single day's journey; but if they had been all able to travel over a  large desert, and, besides that, to fight and conquer those that opposed  them, they had not all of them had buboes on their groins after the  sixth day was over; for no such distemper comes naturally and of  necessity upon those that travel; but still, when there are many ten  thousands in a camp together, they constantly march a settled space [in  a day]. Nor is it at all probable that such a thing should happen by  chance; this would be prodigiously absurd to be supposed. However, our  admirable author Apion hath before told us that \"they came to Judea in  six days' time;\" and again, that \"Moses went up to a mountain that lay  between Egypt and Arabia, which was called Sinai, and was concealed  there forty days, and that when he came down from thence he gave laws to  the Jews.\" But, then, how was it possible for them to tarry forty days  in a desert place where there was no water, and at the same time to pass  all over the country between that and Judea in the six days? And as for  this grammatical translation of the word Sabbath, it either contains an  instance of his great impudence or gross ignorance; for the words Sabbo  and Sabbath are widely different from one another; for the word Sabbath  in the Jewish language denotes rest from all sorts of work; but the word  Sabbo, as he affirms, denotes among the Egyptians the malady of a bubo  in the groin.    3. This is that novel account which the Egyptian Apion gives us  concerning the Jews' departure out of Egypt, and is no better than a  contrivance of his own. But why should we wonder at the lies he tells  about our forefathers, when he"]]]
