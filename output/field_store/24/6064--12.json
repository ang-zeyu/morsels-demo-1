His daughter, herself an amateur in the science of       harmonious sounds, heard of Elizabeth's peculiar structure       of mind. Miss Price invited her to her house. She listened       with delighted surprise to her songs. She offered to       accompany her upon the guitar. This was a concurrence of       circumstances which formed the era of her life. Her pulses       quickened as she stood and watched the fair Anglo-Saxon       fingers of her young patroness run over the keyboard of a       full-toned piano-forte, eliciting sweet, sad, sacred, solemn       sounds. Emotion well-nigh overcame her; but the gentle       encouragement of her fair young friend dissipated her fears,       and increased her confidence. She sang; and before she had       finished she was surrounded by the astonished inmates of the       house, who, attracted by the remarkable compass and       sweetness of her voice, stealthily entered the room, and now       unperceived stood gathered behind her. The applause which       followed the first trial before this small but intelligent       audience gratified as much as it embarrassed her, from the       unexpected and sudden surprise. She not only received an       invitation to repeat her visit, but Miss Price, for a       reasonable compensation, undertook her instruction in the       first rudiments of music. The progress of genius is not like       that of common minds. It is needless to say that her       improvement was very rapid.\"    But the lessons above mentioned were taken quite privately, and  without, at first, the knowledge of her guardian. Elizabeth was  rapidly acquiring an acquaintance with music, when some one  maliciously informed Mrs. Greenfield, with the expectation of seeing  an injunction laid upon the pupil's efforts. The old lady sent for  Elizabeth, who came tremblingly into her presence, expecting to be  reprimanded for her pursuit of an art forbidden by the Friends'  discipline. \"Elizabeth,\" said she, \"is it true that thee is learning  music, and can play upon the guitar?\"--\"It is true,\" was her reply.  \"Go get thy guitar, and let me hear thee sing.\" Elizabeth did so; and,  when she had concluded her song, she was astonished to hear the kind  lady say, \"Elizabeth, whatever thee wants thee shall have.\" From that  time her guardian was the patroness of her earnest efforts for skill  and knowledge in musical science.    She began to receive invitations to entertain private parties by the  exhibition of the gift which the God of nature had bestowed.         \"Upon the death of her patroness, in consequence of the       contested will she found herself thrown upon her own       resources for a maintenance. Remembering some friends in the       western part of New York, she resolved to visit them. While       crossing Lake Seneca, _en route_ to Buffalo, there came       sweetly stealing upon the senses of the passengers of the       steamer her rich, full, round, clear voice, unmarred by any       flaw. The lady passengers, especially the noble Mrs. Gen.       P., feeling that the power and sweetness of her voice       deserved attention, urged her to sing again, and were not       satisfied until five or six more songs were given to them.       Before reaching their destined port she had made many       friends. The philanthropic Mrs. Gen. P. became her friend       and patroness. She at once invited Elizabeth to her splendid       mansion in Buffalo, and, learning her simple story, promptly       advised her to devote herself entirely to the science of       music. During her visit a private party was given by this       lady, to which all the _elite_ of the city were invited.       Elizabeth acquitted herself so admirably, that, two days       later, a card of invitation came to her through the public       press, signed by the prominent gentlemen of Buffalo,       requesting her to give a series of concerts.         \"In October, 1851, she sang before the Buffalo Musical       Association; and her performances were received with marks       of approbation from the best musical talent in the city,       that established her reputation as a songstress. 'Give the       \"Black Swan,\"' said they, 'the cultivation and experience of       the fair Swede or Mlle. Parodi, and she will rank favorably       with those popular singers who have carried the nation into       captivity by their rare musical abilities. Her voice has a       full, round sound, and is of immense compass and depth. She       strikes every note in a clear and well-defined manner, and       reaches the highest capacity of the human voice with       wonderful ease, and apparently an entire want of exertion.       Beginning with G in the _bass clef_, she runs up the scale       to E in the _treble clef_, and gives each note its full       power and tone. She commences at the highest note, and runs       down the scale with the same ease that she strikes any other       lower note. The fact that she accomplishes this with no       apparent exertion is surprising, and fixes at once the       marvellous strength of her vocal organs. Her voice is wholly       natural, and, as might be expected, lacks the training and       exquisite cultivation that belong to the skilful Italian       singer. But the _voice_ is there; and, as a famous maestro       once said, \"it takes a hundred things to make a complete       singer, of which a good voice is ninety-nine.\" If this be       so, Miss Greenfield is on the verge of excellence; and it       remains for the public to decide whether she shall have the       means to pursue her studies.'\"    To several gentlemen in Buffalo belongs the credit of having first  brought out Miss Greenfield in the concert-room. The Buffalo papers  took the matter in hand, and assured the public they had much to  expect from a concert from this vocalist. The deep interest her first  public efforts elicited from them gave occasion to the following  certificate:--         BUFFALO, Oct. 30, 1851.         Mr. H.E. HOWARD.         _Dear Sir_,--At your suggestion, for the purpose of enabling       Miss Elizabeth T. Greenfield to show to her Philadelphia       friends the popularity she has acquired in this city, I       cheerfully certify as follows:--         The concert got up for her was unsolicited on her part, and       entirely the result of admiration of her vocal powers by a       number of our most respectable citizens, who had heard her       at the residence of Gen. Potter, with whose family she had       become somewhat familiar. The concert was attended by an       audience not second in point of numbers to any given here       before, except by Jenny Lind; and not second to any in point       of respectability and fashion. The performance of Miss       Greenfield was received with great applause; and the       expression since, among our citizens generally, is a strong       desire to hear her again.         Respectfully yours, &c.,         G. REED WILSON.    Rochester next extended an invitation for her to visit that city. We  copy the invitation:--         \"The undersigned, having heard of the musical ability of       Miss Elizabeth T. Greenfield of the city of Buffalo, and       being desirous of having her sing in Rochester, request that       she will give a public concert in this city at an early day,       and feel confident that it will afford a satisfactory       entertainment to our citizens.\" (Signed by a large number of       the most respected citizens of Rochester.)         ROCHESTER, Dec. 6, 1851.         This evening, in Corinthian Hall, the anticipated       entertainment is to be presented to our music-loving       citizens. Curiosity will lead many to attend, to whom the       performance of a colored prima donna is a phenomenon at once       wonderful and rare. Miss Greenfield has received from all       who have heard her the name of being a vocalist of       extraordinary power.    Speaking of her concert in Buffalo, \"The Express\" says,--         \"On Monday, Parodi in all her splendor, sustained by Patti       and Strakosch, sang at Corinthian Hall to half a house. Last       night Miss Greenfield sang at the same place to a crowded       house of the respectable, cultivated, and fashionable people       of the city. Jenny Lind has never drawn a better house, as       to character, than that which listened with evident       satisfaction to this unheralded and almost unknown African       nightingale. Curiosity did something for her, but not all.       She has merit, very great merit; and with cultivation       (instruction) she will rank among the very first vocalists       of the age. She has a voice of great sweetness and power,       with a wider range from the lowest to the highest notes than       we have ever listened to: flexibility is not wanting, and       her control of it is beyond example for a new and untaught       vocalist. Her performance was received with marked       approbation and applause from those who knew what to       applaud.\"    Another city paper says,--         \"Much has been said and written of this personage since she       was introduced to the public as a musical prodigy. All sorts       of surmises and conjectures have been indulged in respecting       the claim put forth of her merit; and generally the       impression seemed to prevail, that the novelty of 'color'       and idle curiosity accounted more for the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057"],[0,"Highways and Byways in Surrey (#13)"],[1,"ty, than a manor house or farm homestead, wealthy with huddled  ricks and superb barns, and a simple little church, perhaps the tiniest  of all in Surrey; it measures only forty-five feet by eighteen. I found  it locked, but a village child with engaging confidence told me to \"look  under the brick\" for the key, and under a loose brick in the porch I  found it. It may be lying there to-day. There is little in the church  itself; but when I saw it there was a fine nest of honeybees in the  roof near the bell that hangs on the wall outside. Why do bees so often  swarm in churchyards? Country villagers believe that they like the sound  of dinning metal; perhaps they are attracted to a church by Sunday's  bell.    [Illustration: _Wanborough Church._]    Wanborough sends a rough but pleasant field-road up again to the Hog's  Back, which from here runs another four straight miles along the ridge  to Guildford. This is certainly the noblest highway in Surrey, and,  perhaps, the most characteristic of the county. You may often travel  along it and yet not see the finest of the view on either side; in the  summer, more frequently than not, the whole countryside north and south  of the ridge is swimming in a blue haze which dims and muffles the  horizon. But there is no other road on which you can walk so far and see  so much broad Surrey country open out mile after mile on either side,  and from which you can watch so many changes of woodland and common and  cultured fields, from the green and golden hops about Farnham to the  wheat and oats above Seale and Puttenham, and the long potato drills in  the chalk by Wanborough. But the view is not the single beauty of the  Hog's Back, though to walk high in the wind along open spaces is  possible only on a few roads in the county. The Hog's Back has a treble  charm belonging wholly to the roadway itself; its width, its spacious  grassy rides on each side of the broad hard riband of metal that runs  white and unswerving east and west, and most gracious of all, its deep  and exuberant hedges. All along the road in a light wind you will get  the scent of bed-straw and thyme and clover from the green border of the  road, and in the short down grass find the plants that love  chalk-ground, like the little blue milkwort, which spreads like a film  over the higher slopes of the ridge in summer. If the roadside is  scented with flowers, so are the hedges. Guelder rose and dog rose and  privet blossom side by side with elder and spindle wood; above holly and  hazel and buckthorn stand up gnarled and wind-driven yews, bent over the  road from the south-west. To the south, it is often only through the  gate-gaps in the hedge that you can see out over the flank of the hill;  on the northern side the hedge is lower--low enough, indeed, to be  broken in summer by tall spikes of mullein, yellow against the grey-blue  air over the heaths of Pirbright and Worplesdon. The highest point of  the road lies a mile beyond Wanborough on the way to Guildford; here you  are over five hundred feet up, and the road drops gradually, ending with  a sudden slope almost as soon as Guildford, bricky and cheap-looking  from this aspect, comes into view.

To arrive at Guildford by train is like walking into a garden over a  rubbish heap. In the grace of its building, the charm of its colour, the  fascination of the prospects of its hillside High Street, no town in  Surrey, and perhaps only Oxford in England, is comparable with it. But  between the railway station and the High Street it is desolation and  blank walls. A few pretty old cottages jut out over a narrow pavement;  beyond a huddled roof or two rises the tower of St. Nicholas' Church,  umber and solid; nearly all else is tumbled down ugliness, broken  brickwork, mud and shaggy grass. A clear space, a level green, a bed of  flowers--what an introduction that might be to Guildford. But,  doubtless, the rubbish heap is, or some day will be, too valuable as  building land.    Beyond the turn of the road is the most delightful street in the south  of England. It rises from the bridge crossing the Wey steep into blue  air over the hill. Each side of it is a stairway of roofs up the slope,  a medley of facades, a jumble of architecture astonishing in sheer  extravagance and variety. Gabled houses, red-tiled and gay with  rough-cast and fresh paint; dull, sad-faced houses with sleepy windows  like half-shut eyes; square, solid Georgian houses for doctors with  white chokers and snuff-boxes, and prim old ladies with mittened wrists;  low, little dolls'-houses, red brick neatly pointed; tall, slim houses  graceful with slender casements and light shafts of wood; casements  nobly elaborate in wood-carving and heavy with leaded panes; bay windows  which should belong to nurseries and high, square-latticed windows which  should light a library, delicately fastened with wrought iron; painted  pillars supporting window seats for cats and demure young ladies;  broad-stepped entrances to hotel halls, and archways under which barrels  roll to bursting cellars; Guildford High Street is a model of what the  High Street of an English town should be. Has it a single dominating  feature, or is its air of distinction merely compact of the grace and  old-worldliness of its shops and houses? Perhaps the single extreme  impression left by the High Street is its clock, swung far out over the  road. Massive, black and gilt, and fastened to the face of the old Town  Hall with an ingenious structure of steel stays, it has told Guildford  the time for two centuries and a quarter.    Guildford High Street has its landmarks of history in its Hospital, its  School, and its Town Hall, but its oldest standing record is in one of  its churches. The tower of St. Mary's church, indeed, contains the most  ancient piece of building in the town, perhaps in the county.  Archaeologists are to be found who will argue that part of it, at least,  belongs to the reign of Alfred, though there is little evidence to show  that stone was used for building in Surrey before the eleventh century.  Alfred, at all events, mentions Guildford in his will; he spells it  \"Guldeford,\" one of the dozen old ways of spelling a name that has  always been a puzzle and a pleasure to the etymologists. What does  Guildford mean? Naturally \"The Ford of the Guild.\" The town had a guild  of merchants, and there was a ford; nothing could be simpler. But the  simple explanations are usually wrong; and the most convincing  derivation is one which has been suggested by Mr. Ralph Nevill, who  discovered a river named Guilou in Asser's _Deeds of Alfred_, and points  to several other names along the Wey which may be traced to the same  source. There is Willey House, and Willey Mill near Farnham; Wilsham  Farm near Alton, and Willey Green on another branch of the river.  Guildford, then, is probably the \"ford of the Guilou,\" which in Welsh is  presumably Gwili. Where, then, did the name Wey come from? It may  originally have been Wye. The corruption would be easy; indeed, Cockney  boating parties very likely get the right pronunciation, by accident,  to-day.    Older than St. Mary's tower in associations, if not in stone-work, is  Guildford Castle. The Castle stands on a mound, partly natural, perhaps,  and almost certainly partly artificial. Originally, perhaps, the mound  was used for an early English fortification; it was heightened by  scraping up earth from a ditch at its bottom, and round it was built up  a palisade of wood; possibly there was a wooden house on the top of it,  and then it would have looked precisely like one of the fortified mounds  in the Bayeux Tapestry. Later, it was enclosed in a shell keep; later  still, a Norman square keep was built inside the shell keep; to-day,  except the walls of the square keep, almost all the Castle is gone. It  was never a Castle in much more than name. It has no associations of  great battles; it never stood a siege; it never even held a royal  prisoner. In King John's reign it was already used as a gaol, and a gaol  it remained until James I, in 1612, gave it to one Francis Carter of  Guildford, who used it as a private residence. Four hundred years before  it had seen all its fighting. That was when the French Dauphin, invited  by John's angry barons, marched against it and took it from defenders  who seem to have cared little whether they kept it or not.    But the Castle still has its legend--a legend only--of cruelty and  bloody massacre. In 1036, when Harold Harefoot was king, Alfred the son  of Ethelred was travelling from Normandy to join his mother at  Winchester. He landed in Kent, and was marching with his Normans along  the Way, whether or not with the intention of eventually trying to  recover his father's kingdom is uncertain; at all events, at Guildford  he was seized and put to death. So much is history; legend supplies a  dreadful embellishment. Early in the morning after their capture,  Alfred's followers were led out into the street and condemned to death.  Nine out of every ten men were butchered, until out of six hundred  Normans sixty only were left alive. That was not enough to glut their  captors' fury. The sixty were gone through again, and all but six were  ferociously tortured to death. Alfred himself "]]]
