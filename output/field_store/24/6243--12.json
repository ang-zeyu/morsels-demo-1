[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38750"],[0,"Current History: A Monthly Magazine of the New York Times, May 1918 (#13)"],[1,"  At 9:45 A. M. an infantry attack began. Each German division engaged had  a front of attack of about a mile and a half, and seems to have been  disposed as follows: Two regiments, less a battalion of each, were in  the first line, and one regiment was in reserve. Battalions were  echeloned in a depth of two companies, each with six light machine guns,  constituting the first wave. The second wave of two companies, carrying  heavier machine guns, followed at an interval of 100 yards. These were  followed at 200 or 300 yards' distance by light bomb-throwers and the  battalion staff. Finally there came one-inch and other very light field  guns, called \"artillery of accompaniment,\" which deployed as required.  The divisional reserves consisted of five infantry battalions. No new  gas was used, and although the enemy has tanks they were not brought  into action.      FIFTY GERMAN DIVISIONS    The first attack was made by perhaps fifty divisions, or about 750,000  men. Of these at least ten divisions, and perhaps thirteen or fourteen,  were thrown into the corner of the field between St. Quentin, La Fere,  and Noyon. They were divided into six columns.    The first consisted of a division with three battalions of chasseurs,  which, debouching from La Fere, quickly took Tergnier, and on the  evening of March 22 came to a stop before Vouel, the next village  westward, and a division which came into action on the evening of the  22d passed the first, and on the following day pushed on toward Chauny.    The second column consisted of two divisions. The former advanced from  the old line near Moy, on the Oise, through La Fontaine and Remigny and  to the southwest. It stopped at Liez, on the Crosat Canal, on the 22d.  That night it was passed by the other division, which, on the 23d,  captured Villequier-Aumont, on the St. Quentin-Chauny road. To the right  of this was the third column, composed of two divisions. The first  attacked through Cerizy to Benay and Hinacourt, and was stopped on the  evening of the 22d at Lamontagne. It was passed that evening by the  other division on the canal, which, after occupying Genlis Wood, closed  up to the second column.    The fourth column included the 1st and 10th Divisions, of which the  former attacked through Essigny to Jussy, and on the 23d was at the  north of Ugny, while the latter on its right passed the canal and  reached Ugny and Beaumont.    Of the fifth column, which occupied the region of Villeselve, and the  sixth, in the Ham-Noyon sector, my information is slighter, owing to the  severity of the trial of the British contingents there before the French  took over the front.    One division of the sixth column attacked at Le Plessis, north of  Guiscard, on the 24th, and on the following day took Muirancourt,  Rimbercourt and Croisilles. Its right was then prolonged by a division  at Freniches.      BRITISH FRONT BROKEN    On the evening of the 22d the front of the British Army ran along the  Crozat Canal from Tergnier, through Jussy, to the east of St. Simon.    Very well do I remember the bridgehead of Jussy as I saw it after the  German retreat a year ago. The town, built almost wholly of brick, was  absolutely leveled to the ground, not a single wall standing. I saw it  again last Summer, when General X., a fine soldier and an enlightened  gentleman, had set up a camp hospital and swimming bath, and the bridge  had been decorated to celebrate the entry of America into the war. It  was seven miles behind the front, and I confess we never thought to see  the boche there again.    At 6 P. M. on the 22d General ----received the news that the British  front had been broken between Beauvois and Vaux, nine miles due west of  St. Quentin, and that his corps must fall back to Ham and the villages  of Sancourt and Matigny, immediately north of it. At 8 or 9 o'clock next  morning the news came in that the enemy was just debouching from the  south of Ham toward Esmery-Hallon. The British 5th Corps was then in the  region of Guiscard-Beaumont-Guivry ready for relief.    On the morning of the 24th two German divisions, the first and second  columns, continued their movements in the Oise Valley, while the third  and fourth columns took Ugny and Genlis Wood. On the 25th one division  reached Croisilles, while another attacked Baroeuf on the north of the  Oise, half way between Noyon and Chauny.    On the 26th one division was near Noyon, another at Larbroye, southwest  of that town, and a third at Suzoy, two miles west of it. Clemenceau's  classic phrase, \"Remember that the Germans are at Noyon,\" had  unexpectedly come alive again.      ALLIED TEAMWORK    Noyon, unlike Chauny, Ham, and other neighboring places, was not greatly  damaged by the Germans before their retreat last year. South of the town  rises a conical hill called Mont Renaud, which is capped with a wood  hiding the chateau built on the site of an ancient abbey. On Thursday,  when the Germans were ensconced on Mont Renaud, a French General  expressed in the presence of the English General commanding a cavalry  division his intention of retaking it. The British commander at once  asked that his own troops should have the honor of making the attack.  This was agreed to, and the British cavalry, dismounted, carried the  hill by assault in face of a stubborn defense by the enemy.    I am assured that along the line where the French relieved the British  troops, or where they have been acting together, the best relations have  prevailed, and that the co-operation of the staffs and field officers  has been most cordial.    The French, like the British, aviators, by the boldness of their bombing  and their machine-gun work on the line of the German advance, have done  much to compensate for the allied losses and the unavoidable delay in  getting the French batteries into their new positions. Prisoners say the  German 88th Division was nearly wiped out, and that the 206th suffered  almost as badly.      VON HUTIER'S METHODS    Details of the first advance from St. Quentin to Noyon illustrate the  new method pursued in this offensive in the particular way in which one  large unit passes through another in order to carry the movement forward  as rapidly as possible.    Another feature is its readiness to change the direction of march when  great difficulty is found by the Germans or a marked weakness on the  allied side invites such a change. Of the divisions named above, six  disappeared from that front in the course of the concentration toward  Noyon. They had been diverted westward when it was recognized that the  Oise could not be forced, and Amiens became the chief objective.    It is certain that General von Hutier's plans were based upon his  experience in the capture of Riga. * * * Western resistance, whether  French or British, is a very different thing from that which the  Russians put up at Riga. Enormous as are the forces the enemy put into  this blow, though for the last week they outnumbered and generally  overwhelmed those hurried up to meet them, they had to pay terribly for  their success. German war doctrine recognizes this as inevitable in what  is intended for a decisive operation against great antagonists. Against  soldiers less experienced, disciplined, and inspired than those of the  western Allies Hindenburg would have succeeded.    The adaptability of direction of attack which I have indicated is  remarkable, but the same adaptability in the attack upon Verdun, where  the right and left banks of the Meuse were alternately tried, gave no  result. This time the main direction has been thrice changed. It began  with the wings at St. Quentin and Croisilles; it then moved to the right  centre from Bapaume to Albert; finally it is concentrated on the left  centre on both sides of Montdidier.    Because of its methods and speed the battle thus far has been mainly one  of artillery. German cavalry has been met in small numbers, but it has  not taken a brilliant part. The enemy's aviation service has been  notably inferior to that of the Allies. Only light guns with a few  four-inch pieces have been able to keep up with the advance, and trench  mortars do not seem to have been brought up quickly. On the other hand,  groups of allied machine gunners and machine riflemen, taking advantage  of the depressions of the ground, have everywhere taken heavy toll of  their adversaries. By the time they can transport their heavier guns the  Allies will have their former superiority ready to answer them.      FAILED TO BREAK THROUGH    March 26.--A full third of the German forces on the western front have  been engaged on one-eighth of its extent. It is not impossible that a  secondary offensive may be declared, but it may be taken that we now  know the worst, and that the utmost possible strength has been put into  the first blow.    The choice suggests the need of obtaining a rapid decision and the hope  of shaking the will of our people. If it resulted in a break-through it  would be justified as good strategy; if not, a number of prisoners and  miles of ravaged territory have been taken, with no compensation for the  costs.    So far there is nothing like a break-through. The French are holding  strongly in the Oise Valley, in safe connection with the British on the  Somme.      FRENCH SOLDIERS CONFIDENT    March 27.--I have been along the French front today, and the news is  that, although the battle broke with extraordinary violence, it found  the French prepared, and all is well.    As I watched the sun set in a crimson flood yesterday behind the Noyon  hills there seemed to be a pause in the struggle. At least, the  bombardment had slackened, and at one of the headquarters of the French  Army on the Oise there was no news of an attack then proceeding.    The result of this momentary lull was to enhance the impression of calm  order and confidence which is one's usual experience in passing from the  rear to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38767"],[0,"Spanish Highways and Byways (#13)"],[1," were the banners and costumes of the third procession,  very effective through the deepening dusk. Their leading pageant was a  Gethsemane, famous for the beauty of the carving. Christ is  represented in prayer before an angel, who bears in one hand the cross  and in the other the cup of bitterness, while Peter, James, and John  are sleeping near their Master. These Passion groups are, with a few  exceptions of still earlier date, works of the seventeenth century,  the glorious period of Spanish art, the day of Murillo and Velazquez.  The most and best are from the hand of the Sevillian Montanes, of  chief repute in the Spanish school of polychrome sculpture, but this  Gethsemane was carved by his imitator, Roldan, whose daughter, La  Roldana, is accredited with the figure of the angel and with the  reliefs that adorn the pedestal.    Another Virgin, who, like all the rest, seemed a scintillation of gold  and jewels, swept by, and a new troop of Nazarenes, this time in  purple and white, passed with two august pageants,--the Descent from  the Cross and the Fifth Anguish of Mary. Then came two files of  ash-colored figures, who marshalled, between their rows of starry  tapers, each taper bending toward its opposite, a vivid presentation  of the Crowning with Thorns; and, after this, their Mary of the  Valley, noted for the gracious sweetness of her countenance. This  image is held to be one of Montanes's masterpieces in wood-carving.    Five processions had now passed, with their two pageants each, and the  hour was late, but we could not leave the balcony for anything so  commonplace as dinner. Far down the street of _Las Sierpes_ waved a  river of lights, announcing the advent of the most ancient of all the  Sevillian brotherhoods, Jesus of the Passion. The crowded _plaza_ rose  in reverence as the Crucifixion _paso_ was borne by, and Our Lady of  Mercy, too magnificent for her name, was greeted with rapturous  outcries.      [Illustration: OFF FOR THE WAR]    Just how and when and where something in the way of food was taken, I  hardly know, but as this, the last of the Thursday evening  processions, passed in music out of the _plaza_, a few of us made  speed by a deserted side street to the cathedral. We were too late for  the _Miserere_, which was just closing in that surprising hubbub,  the stamping of feet and beating of canes and chairs against the  floor, by which Spanish piety is wont to \"punish Judas.\" But we took  our station near by the entrance to the Royal Chapel, wherein had been  erected the grand Holy Week monument, in white and gold, shaped like a  temple, and shining with innumerable silver lamps and taper lights.  Within this monument the Host, commonly spoken of in Spain as _Su  Majestad_, had been solemnly placed the night before, much as the  mediaeval church used to lay the crucifix, with requiems, under the  High Altar on Good Friday, and joyously bring it forth again Easter  morning. But Spanish Catholicism is strangely indifferent to dates,  burying the Host on Wednesday and celebrating the Resurrection  Saturday.    All day long the Royal Chapel had been filled with relays upon relays  of kneeling worshippers, and the hush there had been so profound that  the hum of the tourist-haunted nave and the tumult of the streets  seemed faint and foreign to the hearing, like sounds a universe away.  Before this chapel entrance all the pageants, as they were borne in  silence through the cathedral, paused and did homage to the Host.  Having outstripped the procession, we had arrived in season to witness  three of these salutations. The Nazarenes, in passing, fell upon their  knees in the light of the great, gleaming monument, and each of the  heavy platforms was slowly swung about so that it faced this symbol of  Christ's sepulchre.    Yet there was something besides devotion in the cathedral. As the  crowd pressed close, we felt, more than once, a fumbling at our  pockets, and the little artist lost her purse. The rest of us  comforted her by saying over and over that she ought to have known  better than to bring it, and by severally relating how cautious we had  been on our own accounts.    It was hard upon eleven when we returned to the house, but the streets  were all alive with people. I went to the balcony at midnight, and  again at the stroke of one, and both times looked down upon a _plaza_  crossed and recrossed in all directions by talkative, eager groups.  Many of these restless promenaders had been able to get no lodgings,  and were walking to keep warm. The pressure upon the hotels was so  great that one desperate stranger this Thursday night paid twenty  dollars for a cot from ten o'clock till two, and private hospitality  was taxed to a degree that nothing but Spanish courtesy and  good-nature could ever have endured. In the house which harbored us,  for instance, we were all fitted in as compactly as the pieces of a  puzzle, when the unexpected friends began to arrive.    On Wednesday there appeared from the far north a man and wife,  acquaintances of ten years back. Our host and hostess greeted this  surprise party with Andalusian sunshine in their faces, and yielded up  their own room. Thursday morning there walked gayly in one of the  son's university classmates from Madrid. Don Pepe embraced him like a  brother, and surrendered the sofa, which was all he had left to give.  And this Thursday midnight, as a crowning touch, three more chums of  college days came clattering at the bell. Their welcome was as cordial  as if the household were pining for society. The tired maids, laughing  gleefully over the predicament, contributed their own mattresses and  pillows, and made up beds on the study floor, where Don Pepe camped  out with his comrades, to rise with a headache that lasted for days  after.    By two o'clock I had taken my station on the balcony for an all-night  vigil. The most of the family bore me company for the cogent reason  that they had nowhere to sleep, but the other guests of the house held  out for only an hour or two, and then went blinking to their repose.  My memory of the night is strangely divided between the dreamlike,  unearthly pomps and splendors streaming through the square below and  the kindly, cheery people who came and went about me. The senora,  still fresh and charming, although she has wept the deaths of fourteen  out of her nineteen children, was merrily relating, with weary head  against her husband's shoulder, her almost insuperable difficulties in  the way of furnishing her table. The milkman roundly declared that if  she wanted a double quantity of the precious fluid (and goat's milk at  that), she must make it up with water. There was no meat to be had in  the Catholic city during these holy days, and even her baker had  forsaken his oven and gone off to see the sights. And the  black-bearded senor, who, like his wife, had not been in bed for forty  odd hours, laughed at her and comforted her, puffed harder than ever  at his cigarette, and roguishly quoted the saying, \"He whom God loves  has a house in Seville.\"    By two o'clock the seats on the grand stand were filling fast, the  _plaza_ hummed with excitement, the balconies resounded with song and  laughter, and the strong electric lights in front of the city hall  cast a hard, white brilliance over all the scene. The frying of  _calientes_, an Andalusian version of twisted doughnuts, was in savory  progress here and there on the outskirts of the throng, and our ever  thoughtful hostess did not fail to keep her balcony well supplied  with these crisp dainties.    The twinkling of taper lights, so warm and yellow under those pallid  globes of electric glare, appeared while people were still hurrying to  their places; but hundreds upon hundreds of black and gold figures had  paced by before the first of their _pasos_ came into view. For these  processions of the dawn, _de madrugada_, call out great numbers of the  devout, who would thus keep the last watch with their Lord. The clocks  struck three as the leading pageant, a very ancient image of Christ,  bearing a silver-mounted cross of tortoise-shell, halted before the  Alcalde. A white banner wrought with gold heralded the Virgin, who  rose, in glistening attire, from a golden lake of lights.    The wealthy _cofradia_ of San Lorenzo followed in their costly habits  of black velvet. They, too, conducted a pageant of Christ bearing His  cross, one of the most beautiful groups of Montanes, the pedestal  adorned with angels in relief. To the Christ, falling on the Via  Dolorosa, the brotherhood, with the usual disregard of historic  propriety, had given a royal mantle of ermine, embroidered with gold  and pearls. A large company of black-clad women, carrying candles,  walked behind the _paso_, on their penitential march of some eight  hours. Many of them were ladies delicately bred, whose diamonds  sparkled on the breast of the approaching Mary. For the Sevillian  senoras are accustomed to lend their most valuable gems to their  favorite Virgins for the _Semana Santa_, and San Lorenzo's Lady of  Grief is said to have worn this night the worth of millions. She  passed amid a great attendant throng, in such clouds of incense that  the eye could barely catch the shimmer of her silver pedestal, the  gleam of the golden broideries that almost hid the velvet of her  mantle, and the flashes and jets of light that shot from the  incredible treasure of jewels that she wore.    The third troop of Nazarenes, robed in white and violet, bore for  banner a white cross upon a violet ground. Their Christ-pageant  pictured Pilate in his judgment seat in the act of condemning the Son  of God to death. Jesus, guarded by armed soldiers, calmly confronts  the troubled judge, at whose knee wait two little pages with a basin  of water and towels.    And now came one of the most gorgeous features of the Holy Week  processions--a legion of Roman soldiers,"]]]
