A faithful Home-Indian, who was on a hunting excursion,  discovering those strangers, and supposing them to be enemies,  immediately returned to the Fort, and informed the Governor of the  circumstance, who gave little credit to it. However, every measure was  taken for the defence of the Fort, and orders were given to the Master  of a sloop that lay at some distance, to come to the Fort with all  possible expedition on hearing a gun fired.    Accordingly, in the middle of the night, or rather in the morning, the  French came before the Fort, marched up to the gate, and demanded  entrance. Mr. Barlow, who was then on the watch, told them that the  Governor was asleep, but he would get the keys immediately. The French,  hearing this, expected no opposition, and flocked up to the gate as  close as they could stand. Barlow took the advantage of this  opportunity, and instead of opening the gate, only opened two port  holes, where two six-pounders stood loaded with grape shot, which were  instantly fired. This discharge killed great numbers of the French, and  among them the Commander, who was an Irishman.    Such an unexpected reception made the remainder retire with great  precipitation; and the Master of the sloop hearing the guns, made the  best of his way up to the Fort; but some of the French who lay concealed  under the banks of the river killed him, and all the boat's crew.    The French retired from this place with reluctance; for some of them  were heard shooting in the neighbourhood of the Fort ten days after they  were repulsed; and one man in particular walked up and down the platform  leading from the gate of the Fort to the Launch for a whole day. Mr.  Fullarton, who was then Governor at Albany, spoke to him in French, and  offered him kind quarters if he chose to accept them; but to those  proposals he made no reply, and only shook his head. Mr. Fullarton then  told him, that unless he would resign himself up as a prisoner, he would  most assuredly shoot him; on which the man advanced nearer the Fort, and  Mr. Fullarton shot him out of his chamber window. Perhaps the hardships  this poor man expected to encounter in his return to Canada, made him  prefer death; but his refusing to receive quarter from so humane and  generous an enemy as the English, is astonishing.    [E] I have seen the remains of those houses several times; they are on  the West side of the harbour, and in all probability will be discernible  for many years to come.    It is rather surprising, that neither Middleton, Ellis, Christopher,  Johnston, nor Garbet, who have all of them been at Marble Island, and  some of them often, ever discovered this harbour; particularly the  last-mentioned gentleman, who actually sailed quite round the island in  a very fine pleasant day in the Summer of 1766. But this discovery was  reserved for a Mr. Joseph Stephens! a man of the least merit I ever  knew, though he then had the command of a vessel called the _Success_,  employed in the whale-fishery; and in the year 1769, had the command of  the _Charlotte_ given to him, a fine brig of one hundred tons; when I  was his mate.    [F] The conditions offered me on this occasion cannot be better  expressed than in the Company's own words, which I have transcribed from  their private letter to me, dated 25th May 1769:    \"From the good opinion we entertain of you, and Mr. Norton's  recommendation, we have agreed to raise your wages to L----[18] _per  annum_ for two years, and have placed you in our Council at Prince of  Wales's Fort; and we should have been ready to advance you to the  command of the _Charlotte_, according to your request, if a matter of  more immediate consequence had not intervened.    \"Mr. Norton has proposed an inland Journey, far to the North of  Churchill, to promote an extension of our trade, as well as for the  discovery of a North West Passage, Copper Mines, &c.; and as an  undertaking of this nature requires the attention of a person capable of  taking an observation for determining the longitude and latitude, and  also distances, and the course of rivers and their depths, we have fixed  upon you (especially as it is represented to us to be your own  inclination) to conduct this Journey, with proper assistants.    \"We therefore hope you will second our expectations in readily  performing this service, and upon your return we shall willingly make  you any acknowledgment suitable to your trouble therein.    \"We highly approve of your going in the _Speedwell_, to assist on the  whale-fishery last year, and heartily wish you health and success in the  present expedition.    \"We remain your loving Friends,        \"BIBYE LAKE, Dep. Gov.      \"JOHN ANTHONY MERLE.      \"ROBERT MERRY.      \"SAMUEL WEGG.      \"JAMES WINTER LAKE.      \"HERMAN BERENS.      \"JOSEPH SPURREL.      \"JAMES FITZ GERALD.\"    The Company had no sooner perused my Journals and Charts, than they  ordered a handsome sum to be placed to the credit of my account; and in  the two first paragraphs of their letter to me, dated 12th May 1773,  they express themselves in the following words:        \"Mr. SAMUEL HEARNE,        \"SIR,--Your letter of the 28th August last gave us the agreeable      pleasure to hear of your safe return to our Factory. Your      Journal, and the two charts you sent, sufficiently convince us      of your very judicious remarks.        \"We have maturely considered your great assiduity in the various      accidents which occurred in your several Journies. We hereby      return you our grateful thanks; and to manifest our obligation      we have consented to allow you a gratuity of L----[19] for those      services.\"    As a farther proof of the Company's being perfectly satisfied with my  conduct while on that Journey, the Committee unanimously appointed me  Chief of Prince of Wales's Fort in the Summer of 1775; and Mr. Bibye  Lake, who was then Governor, and several others of the Committee,  honoured me with a regular correspondence as long as they lived.    [18] Stated by Beckles Willson to be L130.    [19] Stated by Beckles Willson to be L200.    [G] By the Home-guard Indians we are to understand certain of the  natives who are immediately employed under the protection of the  Company's servants, reside on the plantation, and are employed in  hunting for the Factory.[20]    [20] The Southern or Homeguard Indians here referred to were Crees, one  of the most numerous tribes of the Algonquian family. The Northern  Indians were Chipewyans, a tribe of the Tinne family.    [H] The Calimut is a long ornamented stem of a pipe, much in use among  all the tribes of Indians who know the use of tobacco. It is  particularly used in all cases of ceremony, either in making war or  peace; at all public entertainments, orations, &c.    [I] No convenient opportunity offered during my last Journey, except  one, on the 22d March 1771; and as nothing material had happened during  that part of my Journey, I thought there was not any necessity for  sending an extract of my Journal; I therefore only sent a Letter to the  Governor, informing him of my situation with respect to latitude and  longitude, and some account of the usage which I received from the  natives, &c.    [J] By mistake in my former Journal and Draft called Arathapefcow.    [K] This was barely probable, as Matonabbee at that time had not any  information of this Journey being set on foot, much less had he received  orders to join me at the place and time here appointed; and had we  accidentally met, he would by no means have undertaken the Journey  without first going to the Factory, and there making his agreement with  the Governor; for no Indian is fond of performing any particular service  for the English, without first knowing what is to be his reward. At the  same time, had I taken that rout on my out-set, it would have carried me  some hundreds of miles out of my road. See my Track on the Map in the  Winter 1770, and the Spring 1771.    [L] I was not provided with instruments for cutting on stone; but for  form-sake, I cut my name, date of the year, &c., on a piece of board  that had been one of the Indian's targets, and placed it in a heap of  stones on a small eminence near the entrance of the river, on the South  side.    [M] There is certainly no harm in making out all Instructions in the  fullest manner, yet it must be allowed that those two parts might have  been omitted with great propriety; for as neither Middleton, Ellis, nor  Christopher were able to penetrate far enough up those inlets to  discover any kind of herbage except moss and grass, much less woods, it  was not likely those parts were so materially altered for the better  since their times, as to make it worth my while to attempt a farther  discovery of them; and especially as I had an opportunity, during my  second Journey, of proving that the woods do not reach the sea-coast by  some hundreds of miles in the parallel of Chesterfield's Inlet. And as  the edge of the woods to the Northward always tends to the Westward, the  distance must be greatly increased in the latitude of Wager Strait.  Those parts have long since been visited by the Company's servants, and  are within the known limits of their Charter; consequently require no  other form of possession.    [N] See the preceding Note.    [O] The Continent of America is much wider than many people imagine,  particularly Robson, who thought that the Pacific Ocean was but a few  days journey from the West coast of Hudson's Bay. This, however, is so  far from being the case, that when I was at my greatest Western  distance, upward of five hundred miles from Prince of Wales's Fort, the  natives, my guides, well knew that many tribes of Indians lay to the  West of us, and they knew no end to the land in that direction; nor have  I met "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38418"],[0,"From Manassas to Appomattox: Memoirs of the Civil War in America (#13)"],[1,"the conduct of  the division commander, he would have drawn the hearts of his officers and  soldiers towards him, and toned up the war spirit and _morale_ of his men.  Tyler was right in principle, in the construction of duty, under the  orders, and in his more comprehensive view of the military zodiac. In no  other way than by testing the strength along the direct route could  McDowell justify delay, when time was power, and a long march with raw  troops in July weather was pending.    The delay gave Beauregard greater confidence in his preconceived plan, and  brought out his order of the 21st for advance towards McDowell's reserve  at Centreville, but this miscarried, and turned to advantage for the plans  of the latter.    Had a prompt, energetic general been in command when, on the 20th, his  order of battle was settled upon, the division under Tyler would have been  deployed in front of Stone Bridge, as soon after nightfall as darkness  could veil the march, and the divisions under Hunter and Heintzelman  following would have been stretched along the lateral road in bivouac, so  as to be prepared to cross Sudley's Ford and put in a good day's work on  the morrow. Had General Tyler's action of the 18th received proper  recognition, he would have been confident instead of doubting in his  service. McDowell's army posted as it should have been, a march at  daylight would have brought the columns to the Henry House before seven  o'clock, dislodged Evans, busied by Tyler's display at the bridge, without  a chance to fight, and brought the three divisions, reunited in gallant  style, along the turnpike with little burning of powder. Thus prepared and  organized, the compact battle-order of twenty thousand men would have been  a fearful array against Beauregard's fragmentary left, and by the events  as they passed, would have assured McDowell of victory hours before Kirby  Smith and Elzey, of the Army of the Shenandoah, came upon the field.    Beauregard's mistake was in failing to ride promptly after his  five-o'clock order, and handling his columns while in action. As events  actually occurred, he would have been in overwhelming numbers against  McDowell's reserve and supply depot. His adversary so taken by surprise,  his raw troops would not have been difficult to conquer.    As the experience of both commanders was limited to staff service, it is  not surprising that they failed to appreciate the importance of prompt and  vigorous manoeuvre in the hour of battle. Beauregard gave indications of a  comprehensive military mind and reserve powers that might, with experience  and thorough encouragement from the superior authorities, have developed  him into eminence as a field-marshal. His adversary seemed untoward, not  adapted to military organization or combinations. Most of his men got back  to Washington under the sheltering wings of the small bands of regulars.    The mistake of supposing Kirby Smith's and Elzey's approaching troops to  be Union reinforcements for McDowell's right was caused by the  resemblance, at a distance, of the original Confederate flag to the colors  of Federal regiments. This mishap caused the Confederates to cast about  for a new ensign, brought out our battle-flag, led to its adoption by  General Beauregard, and afterwards by higher authority as the union shield  of the Confederate national flag.    The supplies of subsistence, ammunition, and forage passed as we marched  through the enemy's camps towards Centreville seemed ample to carry the  Confederate army on to Washington. Had the fight been continued to that  point, the troops, in their high hopes, would have marched in terrible  effectiveness against the demoralized Federals. Gaining confidence and  vigor in their march, they could well have reached the capital with the  ranks of McDowell's men. The brigade at Blackburn's Ford (five regiments),  those at McLean's and Mitchell's Fords, all quite fresh, could have been  reinforced by all the cavalry and most of the artillery, comparatively  fresh, and later by the brigades of Holmes, Ewell, and Early. This  favorable aspect for fruitful results was all sacrificed through the  assumed authority of staff-officers who, upon false reports, gave  countermand to the orders of their chiefs.    On the 21st a regiment and battery were discharged from the Union army,  reducing its aggregate to about 34,000. The Confederates had 31,860.  McDowell crossed Bull Run with 18,500 of his men, and engaged in battle  18,053 Confederates.    There seem to be no data from which the precise figures can be had. These  estimates, though not strictly accurate, are justified by returns so far  as they have been officially rendered.

An Early War-Time Amenity--The Author invited to dine with the      Enemy--\"Stove-pipe Batteries\"--J. E. B. Stuart, the Famous      Cavalryman--His Bold Dash on the Federals at      Lewinsville--Major-General G. W.

E. B. Stuart, constituting part of the command.    We were provokingly near Washington, with orders not to attempt to advance  even to Alexandria. Well-chosen and fortified positions, with soldiers to  man them, soon guarded all approaches to the capital. We had frequent  little brushes with parties pushed out to reconnoitre. Nevertheless, we  were neither so busy nor so hostile as to prevent the reception of a  cordial invitation to a dinner-party on the other side, to be given to me  at the head-quarters of General Richardson. He was disappointed when I  refused to accept this amenity, and advised him to be more careful lest  the politicians should have him arrested for giving aid and comfort to the  enemy. He was my singularly devoted friend and admirer before the war, and  had not ceased to be conscious of old-time ties.    The service at Falls Church, Munson's and Mason's Hills was first by my  brigade of infantry, a battery, and Stuart's cavalry. During that service  the infantry and batteries were relieved every few days, but the cavalry  was kept at the front with me. As the authorities allowed me but one  battery, and that was needed from time to time to strike out at"]]]
