There was no nausea or headache or any  other symptom of \"mountain sickness.\" Indeed, it is hard for us to  understand that affection as many climbers describe it. It has been said  again and again to resemble seasickness in all its symptoms. Now the  writer is of the unfortunate company that are seasick on the slightest  provocation. Even rough water on the wide stretches of the lower Yukon,  when a wind is blowing upstream and the launch is pitching and tossing,  will give him qualms. But no one of the four of us had any such feeling  on the mountain at any time. Shortness of breath we all suffered from,  though none other so acutely as myself. When it was evident that the  progress of the party was hindered by the constant stops on my account,  the contents of my pack were distributed amongst the others and my load  reduced to the mercurial barometer and the instruments, and, later, to  the mercurial barometer alone. It was some mortification not to be able  to do one's share of the packing, but there was no help for it, and the  other shoulders were young and strong and kindly.    [Sidenote: Tobacco]    With some hope of improving his wind, the writer had reduced his smoking  to two pipes a day so soon as the head of the glacier had been reached,  and had abandoned tobacco altogether when camp was first made on the  ridge; but it is questionable if smoking in moderation has much or any  effect. Karstens, who smoked continually, and Walter, who had never  smoked in his life, had the best wind of the party. It is probably much  more a matter of age. Karstens was a man of thirty-two years, and the  two boys were just twenty-one, while the writer approached fifty. None  of us slept as well as usual except Walter--and nothing ever interferes  with his sleep--but, although our slumbers were short and broken, they  seemed to bring recuperation just as though they had been sound. We  arose fresh in the morning though we had slept little and light.    On the 30th May we had made our camp at the Parker Pass; on the 2d June,  the finest and brightest day in three weeks, we moved to our first camp  in the Grand Basin. On the 3d June we moved camp again, out into the  middle of the glacier, at about sixteen thousand five hundred feet.    Here we were at the upper end of one of the flats of the glacier that  fills the Grand Basin, the serac of another great rise just above us.  The walls of the North Peak grow still more striking and picturesque  here, where they attain their highest elevation. These granite ramparts,  falling three thousand feet sheer, swell out into bellying buttresses  with snow slopes between them as they descend to the glacier floor,  while on top, above the granite, each peak point and crest ridge is  tipped with black shale. How comes that ugly black shale, with the  fragments of which all the lower glacier is strewn, to have such lofty  eminence and granite-guarded distinction, as though it were the most  beautiful or the most valuable thing in the world? The McKinley Fork of  the Kantishna, which drains the Muldrow, is black as ink with it, and  its presence can be detected in the Tanana River itself as far as its  junction with the Yukon. It is largely soluble in water, and where  melting snow drips over it on the glacier walls below were great  splotches, for all the world as though a gigantic ink-pot had been  upset.    [Illustration: Second camp in the Grand Basin--looking down, 16,500  feet.]    [Sidenote: The Flagstaff]    While we sat resting awhile on our way to this camp, gazing at these  pinnacles of the North Peak, we fell to talking about the pioneer  climbers of this mountain who claimed to have set a flagstaff near the  summit of the North Peak--as to which feat a great deal of incredulity  existed in Alaska for several reasons--and we renewed our determination  that, if the weather permitted when we had reached our goal and ascended  the South Peak, we would climb the North Peak also to seek for traces of  this earliest exploit on Denali, which is dealt with at length in  another place in this book. All at once Walter cried out: \"I see the  flagstaff!\" Eagerly pointing to the rocky prominence nearest the  summit--the summit itself is covered with snow--he added: \"I see it  plainly!\" Karstens, looking where he pointed, saw it also, and, whipping  out the field-glasses, one by one we all looked, and saw it distinctly  standing out against the sky. With the naked eye I was never able to see  it unmistakably, but through the glasses it stood out, sturdy and  strong, one side covered with crusted snow. We were greatly rejoiced  that we could carry down positive confirmation of this matter. It was no  longer necessary for us to ascend the North Peak.    The upper glacier also bore plain signs of the earthquake that had  shattered the ridge. Huge blocks of ice were strewn upon it, ripped off  the left-hand wall, but it was nowhere crevassed as badly as the lower  glacier, but much more broken up into serac. Some of the bergs presented  very beautiful sights, wind-carved incrustations of snow in cameo upon  their blue surface giving a suggestion of Wedgwood pottery. All tints  seemed more delicate and beautiful up here than on the lower glacier.    On the 5th June we advanced to about seventeen thousand five hundred  feet right up the middle of the glacier. As we rose that morning slowly  out of the flat in which our tent was pitched and began to climb the  steep serac, clouds that had been gathering below swept rapidly up into  the Grand Basin, and others swept as rapidly over the summits and down  upon us. In a few moments we were in a dense smother of vapor with  nothing visible a couple of hundred yards away. Then the temperature  dropped, and soon snow was falling which increased to a heavy snow-storm  that raged an hour. We made our camp and ate our lunch, and by that time  the smother of vapor passed, the sun came out hot again, and we were all  simultaneously overtaken with a deep drowsiness and slept. Then out into  the glare again, to go down and bring up the remainder of the stuff, we  went, and that night we were established in our last camp but one. We  had decided to go up at least five hundred feet farther that we might  have the less to climb when we made our final attack upon the peak. So  when we returned with the loads from below we did not stop at camp, but  carried them forward and cached them against to-morrow's final move.    [Illustration: Third camp in the Grand Basin--17,000 feet, showing the  shattering of the glacier walls by the earthquake.    The rocks at the top of the picture are about 19,000 feet high and are  the highest rocks on the south peak of the mountain.]    [Sidenote: Last Camp]    On Friday, the 6th June, we made our last move and pitched our tent in a  flat near the base of the ridge, just below the final rise in the  glacier of the Grand Basin, at about eighteen thousand feet, and we were  able to congratulate one another on making the highest camp ever made in  North America. I set up and read the mercurial barometer, and when  corrected for its own temperature it stood at 15.061. The boiling-point  thermometer registered 180.5, as the point at which water boiled, with  an air temperature of 35 deg. It took one hour to boil the rice for  supper. The aneroids stood at 14.8 and 14.9, still steadily losing on  the mercurial barometer. I think that a rough altitude gauge could be  calculated from the time rice takes to boil--at least as reliable as an  aneroid barometer. At the Parker Pass it took fifty minutes; here it  took sixty. This is about the height of perpetual snow on the great  Himalayan peaks; but we had been above the perpetual snow-line for  forty-eight days.    We were now within about two thousand five hundred feet of the summit  and had two weeks' full supply of food and fuel, which, at a pinch,  could be stretched to three weeks. Certain things were short: the  chocolate and figs and raisins and salt were low; of the zwieback there  remained but two and one-half packages, reserved against lunch when we  attacked the summit. But the meatballs, the erbswurst, the caribou  jelly, the rice, and the tea--our staples--were abundant for two weeks,  with four gallons of coal-oil and a gallon of alcohol. The end of our  painful transportation hither was accomplished; we were within one day's  climb of the summit with supplies to besiege. If the weather should  prove persistently bad we could wait; we could advance our parallels;  could put another camp on the ridge itself at nineteen thousand feet,  and yet another half-way up the dome. If we had to fight our way step by  step and could advance but a couple of hundred feet a day, we were still  confident that, barring unforeseeable misfortunes, we could reach the  top. But we wanted a clear day on top, that the observations we designed  to make could be made; it would be a poor success that did but set our  feet on the highest point. And we felt sure that, prepared as we were to  wait, the clear day would come.    [Illustration: The North Peak, 20,000 feet high.    Our last camp in the Grand Basin, at 18,000 feet: the highest camp ever  made in North America.]    As so often happens when everything unpropitious is guarded against,  nothing unpropitious occurs. It would have been a wonderful chance,  indeed, if, supplied only for one day, a fine, clear day had come. But  supplied against bad weather for two or three weeks, it was no wonder at  all that the very first day should have presented itself bright and  clear. We had exhausted our bad fortune below; here, at the juncture  above all others at which we should have chosen to enjoy it, we were to  encounter our good fortune.    [Sidenote: Breathlessness]    But here, where all signs seemed to promise success to the expedition,  the author began to have fears of personal failure.

The  knowledge that a low-browed gentleman is waiting round the corner  with a sand-bag poised in air will just supply that stimulus. Also  that fillip. It will give our output precisely the edge it  requires.\"    \"Then you'll stay in this thing? You'll stick to the work?\"    \"Like a conscientious leech, Comrade Windsor.\"    \"Bully for you,\" said Billy.    It was not Psmith's habit, when he felt deeply on any subject, to  exhibit his feelings; and this matter of the tenements had hit him  harder than any one who did not know him intimately would have  imagined. Mike would have understood him, but Billy Windsor was too  recent an acquaintance. Psmith was one of those people who are  content to accept most of the happenings of life in an airy spirit  of tolerance. Life had been more or less of a game with him up till  now. In his previous encounters with those with whom fate had  brought him in contact there had been little at stake. The prize of  victory had been merely a comfortable feeling of having had the  best of a battle of wits; the penalty of defeat nothing worse than  the discomfort of having failed to score. But this tenement  business was different. Here he had touched the realities. There  was something worth fighting for. His lot had been cast in pleasant  places, and the sight of actual raw misery had come home to him  with an added force from that circumstance. He was fully aware of  the risks that he must run. The words of the man at the Astor, and  still more the episodes of the family friend from Missouri and the  taximeter cab, had shown him that this thing was on a different  plane from anything that had happened to him before. It was a fight  without the gloves, and to a finish at that. But he meant to see it  through. Somehow or other those tenement houses had got to be  cleaned up. If it meant trouble, as it undoubtedly did, that trouble  would have to be faced.    \"Now that Comrade Jarvis,\" he said, \"showing a spirit of  forbearance which, I am bound to say, does him credit, has declined  the congenial task of fracturing our occiputs, who should you say,  Comrade Windsor, would be the chosen substitute?\"    Billy shook his head. \"Now that Bat has turned up the job, it might  be any one of three gangs. There are four main gangs, you know.  Bat's is the biggest. But the smallest of them's large enough to  put us away, if we give them the chance.\"    \"I don't quite grasp the nice points of this matter. Do you mean  that we have an entire gang on our trail in one solid mass, or will  it be merely a section?\"    \"Well, a section, I guess, if it comes to that. Parker, or whoever  fixed this thing up, would go to the main boss of the gang. If it  was the Three Points, he'd go to Spider Reilly. If it was the Table  Hill lot, he'd look up Dude Dawson. And so on.\"    \"And what then?\"    \"And then the boss would talk it over with his own special  partners. Every gang-leader has about a dozen of them. A sort of  Inner Circle. They'd fix it up among themselves. The rest of the  gang wouldn't know anything about it. The fewer in the game, you  see, the fewer to split up the dollars.\"    \"I see. Then things are not so black. All we have to do is to look  out for about a dozen hooligans with a natural dignity in their  bearing, the result of intimacy with the main boss. Carefully  eluding these aristocrats, we shall win through. I fancy, Comrade  Windsor, that all may yet be well. What steps do you propose to  take by way of self-defence?\"    \"Keep out in the middle of the street, and not go off the Broadway  after dark. You're pretty safe on Broadway. There's too much light  for them there.\"    \"Now that our sleuth-hound friend in the taximeter has ascertained  your address, shall you change it?\"    \"It wouldn't do any good. They'd soon find where I'd gone to. How  about yours?\"    \"I fancy I shall be tolerably all right. A particularly massive  policeman is on duty at my very doors. So much for our private  lives. But what of the day-time? Suppose these sandbag-specialists  drop in at the office during business hours. Will Comrade Maloney's  frank and manly statement that we are not in be sufficient to keep  them out? I doubt it. All unused to the nice conventions of polite  society, these rugged persons will charge through. In such  circumstances good work will be hard to achieve. Your literary man  must have complete quiet if he is to give the public of his best.  But stay. An idea!\"    \"Well?\"    \"Comrade Brady. The Peerless Kid. The man _Cosy Moments_ is running  for the light-weight championship. We are his pugilistic sponsors.  You may say that it is entirely owing to our efforts that he has  obtained this match with--who exactly is the gentleman Comrade  Brady fights at the Highfield Club on Friday night?\"    \"Cyclone Al. Wolmann, isn't it?\"    \"You are right. As I was saying, but for us the privilege of  smiting Comrade Cyclone Al. Wolmann under the fifth rib on Friday  night would almost certainly have been denied to him.\"    It almost seemed as if he were right. From the moment the paper had  taken up his cause, Kid Brady's star had undoubtedly been in the  ascendant. People began to talk about him as a likely man. Edgren,  in the _Evening World_, had a paragraph about his chances for the  light-weight title. Tad, in the _Journal_, drew a picture of him.  Finally, the management of the Highfield Club had signed him for a  ten-round bout with Mr. Wolmann. There were, therefore, reasons  why _Cosy Moments_ should feel a claim on the Kid's services.    \"He should,\" continued Psmith, \"if equipped in any degree with  finer feelings, be bubbling over with gratitude towards us. 'But  for _Cosy Moments_,' he should be saying to himself, 'where should I  be? Among the also-rans.' I imagine that he will do any little  thing we care to ask of him. I suggest that we approach Comrade  Brady, explain the facts of the case, and offer him at a  comfortable salary the post of fighting-editor of _Cosy Moments_. His  duties will be to sit in the room opening out of ours, girded as to  the loins and full of martial spirit, and apply some of those  half-scissor hooks of his to the persons of any who overcome the  opposition of Comrade Maloney. We, meanwhile, will enjoy that  leisure and freedom from interruption which is so essential to the  artist.\"    \"It's not a bad idea,\" said Billy.    \"It is about the soundest idea,\" said Psmith, \"that has ever been  struck. One of your newspaper friends shall supply us with tickets,  and Friday night shall see us at the Highfield.\"        CHAPTER XIV    THE HIGHFIELD    Far up at the other end of the island, on the banks of the Harlem  River, there stands the old warehouse which modern progress has  converted into the Highfield Athletic and Gymnastic Club. The  imagination, stimulated by the title, conjures up a sort of  National Sporting Club, with pictures on the walls, padding on the  chairs, and a sea of white shirt-fronts from roof to floor. But the  Highfield differs in some respects from this fancy picture.  Indeed, it would be hard to find a respect in which it does not  differ. But these names are so misleading. The title under which  the Highfield used to be known till a few years back was \"Swifty  Bob's.\" It was a good, honest title. You knew what to expect; and  if you attended _seances_ at Swifty Bob's you left your gold watch  and your little savings at home. But a wave of anti-pugilistic  feeling swept over the New York authorities. Promoters of boxing  contests found themselves, to their acute disgust, raided by the  police. The industry began to languish. People avoided places where  at any moment the festivities might be marred by an inrush of large  men in blue uniforms armed with locust-sticks.    And then some big-brained person suggested the club idea, which  stands alone as an example of American dry humour. There are now no  boxing contests in New York. Swifty Bob and his fellows would be  shocked at the idea of such a thing. All that happens now is  exhibition sparring bouts between members of the club. It is true  that next day the papers very tactlessly report the friendly  exhibition spar as if it had been quite a serious affair, but that  is not the fault of Swifty Bob.    Kid Brady, the chosen of _Cosy Moments_, was billed for a \"ten-round  exhibition contest,\" to be the main event of the evening's  entertainment. No decisions are permitted at these clubs. Unless a  regrettable accident occurs, and one of the sparrers is knocked  out, the verdict is left to the newspapers next day. It is not  uncommon to find a man win easily in the _World_, draw in the  _American_, and be badly beaten in the _Evening Mail_. The system  leads to a certain amount of confusion, but it has the merit of  offering consolation to a much-smitten warrior.    The best method of getting to the Highfield is by the Subway. To  see the Subway in its most characteristic mood one must travel on  it during the rush-hour, when its patrons are packed into the  carriages in one solid jam by muscular guards and policemen,  shoving in a manner reminiscent of a Rugby football scrum. When  Psmith and Billy entered it on the Friday evening, it was  comparatively empty. All the seats were occupied, but only a few of  the straps and hardly any of the space reserved by law for the  conductor alone.    Conversation on the Subway is impossible. The ingenious gentlemen  who constructed it started with the object of making it noisy. Not  ordinarily noisy, like a ton of coal falling on to a sheet of tin,  but really noisy. So they fashioned the pillars of thin steel, and  the sleepers of thin wood, and loosened all the nuts, and now a  Subway train in motion suggests a prolonged dynamite explosion  blended with the voice of some great cataract.
