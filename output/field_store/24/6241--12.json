The huge drones are helpless; they have no sting with which  to defend themselves; all they can do is to try to escape, or to oppose  the mere force of their weight to the blows that rain down. Forced on to  their back, with their enemies hanging on to them, they will use their  powerful claws to shift them from side to side; or, with a mighty  effort, will turn round in wild circles, dragging with them the  relentless executioners, who never for a moment relax their hold. But  exhaustion soon puts an end; and, in a very brief space, their condition  is pitiful. The wings of the wretched creatures are torn off, their  antennae severed, their legs hacked in two; and their magnificent eyes,  now softened by suffering, reflect only anguish and bitterness. Some die  at once of their wounds, and are dragged away to distant burialgrounds;  others, whose injuries are less, succeed in sheltering themselves in  some corner, where they lie, all huddled together, surrounded by guards,  till they perish of hunger. Many will reach the gate, and escape into  space, dragging their tormentors with them; but, towards evening, driven  by famine and cold, they return in crowds to the hive and pray for  admission. But there they will meet the merciless guard, who will not  allow one to pass; and, the next morning, the workers, before they start  on their journey to the flowers, will clear the threshold of the corpses  that lie strewn on it; and all recollection of the idle race will  disappear till the following spring.    It will often happen that, when several hives are placed close together,  the massacre of the drones will take place on the same day. The richest  and best-governed hives are the first to give the signal; smaller and  less prosperous cities will follow a few days later. It is only the  poorest and weakest colonies that will allow the males to live till the  approach of winter. The execution over, work will begin again, although  less strenuously, for flowers are growing scarce. The great festivals of  the hive, the great tragedies, are over. The autumn honey, that will be  needed for the winter, is accumulating within the hospitable walls; and  the last reservoirs are sealed with the seal of white, incorruptible  wax. Building ceases; there are fewer births and more deaths; the nights  lengthen and days grow shorter. The rain and the wind, the mists of the  morning, the twilight that comes on too soon--these entrap hundreds of  workers who never return to the hive; and over this sunshine-loving  little people there soon hangs the cold menace of winter.    Man has already taken for himself his good share of the harvest. Every  well-conducted hive has presented him with eighty or a hundred pounds of  honey; there are some even which will have given twice that quantity,  all gathered from the sun-lit flowers that will have been visited a  thousand or two times every day. The bee-keeper gives a last look at his  hives, upon which slumber now is falling. From the richest he takes some  of their store, and distributes it among those that are less  well-provided. He covers up the hives, half closes the doors, removes  the frames that now are useless, and abandons the bees to their long  winter sleep.    They huddle together on the central comb, with the queen in the midst of  them, attended by her guard. Row upon row of bees surround the sealed  cells, the last row forming the envelope, as it were; and when these  feel the cold stealing over them, they creep into the crowd, and others  at once take their places. The whole cluster hangs suspended, clinging  on to each other; rising and falling as the cells are gradually emptied  of their store of honey. For, contrary to what is generally believed,  the life of the bee does not cease in winter; it merely becomes less  active. These little lovers of sunshine contrive, through a constant and  simultaneous beating of their wings, to maintain in their hive a degree  of warmth that shall equal that of a day in spring. And they owe this  to the honey, which is itself no more than a ray of heat which has  passed through their bodies, and now gives its generous blood to the  hive. The bees that are nearest the cells pass it on to their neighbors,  and these in their turn to those next them. Thus it goes from mouth to  mouth through the crowd, till it reaches those furthest away. And this  honey, this essence of sunshine and flowers, circulates through the hive  until such time as the sun itself, the glorious sun of the spring, shall  thrust in its beam through the half-open door, and tell of the violets  and anemones that are once more coming to life. The workers will wake,  and discover that the sky again is blue in the world, and that the wheel  of life has turned, and begun afresh.          VI    THE PROGRESS OF THE RACE      It is as well, before ending this book--as we have ended the story of  the hive with the silence that winter brings--to add a few words about  the extraordinary industry of the bees. People are apt to say, while  admitting that it is very wonderful, that it has always been the same  from the very beginning of time. Have the bees not, for thousands of  years, built their combs, their marvelous combs, in just the same way;  these combs that combine the most perfect science of chemist and  architect, mathematician and engineer; combs in which it would be  impossible for us to suggest a single improvement? Where shall we find  any instance of progress, of the bees having discovered some new method  or change in the old; show us that, and we will gladly admit that the  bees, besides their instinct, possess also an intellect worthy of being  compared with that of man!    This method of reasoning is not without its perils. It is the same kind  of \"mere common sense\" that the people of Galileo's time displayed when  they refused to believe that the earth revolved in space. \"The earth  cannot possibly turn,\" they would say, \"for we can see the sun move in  the sky, see it rise in the morning and set in the evening. Nothing can  deceive our eyes.\" Common-sense is all very well; but it is not a sure  guide unless it go hand in hand with a certain reflection and judgment.    The bees give abundant proof that they are capable of reason. As an  instance, we may mention that Andrew Knight, a wellknown student of  insect life, once covered the bark of some diseased trees with a kind of  cement which he had made out of turpentine and wax. Some time after he  noticed that the bees round about were making use of this mixture, which  they had tried and adopted; they had found it close to their hive, and  appeared to prefer it to their own. As a fact, the science of  bee-keeping consists largely in giving the bees the opportunity of  developing the spirit of initiative that they undoubtedly possess. Thus  the bee-keeper, when pollen is scarce and it is important that there  should be food for the larvae, will scatter a quantity of flour near to  the hive. This is a substance that the bees, in a state of nature, in  their native forests in Asia, can never have met with, or known. And  yet, if care be taken to tempt them with it--if one or two be placed on  the flour, and induced to touch it and try it, they will quickly realize  that it more or less resembles the pollen of which they are in need;  they will spread the news among their sisters, and we shall soon find  every forager-bee hurrying to gather this strange food, and supplying it  to the infant-bees in place of the accustomed pollen.      It is only during the last hundred years that the bees have been  seriously studied by man; only fifty years ago that the movable frames  and combs were designed by means of which we were able to watch their  movements. Need we wonder, then, if our knowledge is still somewhat  limited? The bees have existed many thousands of years; we have  observed them only for what is relatively a very short time. And if it  could be proved that, during that time, no change has taken place in the  hive, should we be right in assuming that there had been no change  before our first questioning glance? Remember that a century is no more  than a drop of rain that falls into the river; that a thousand years  glide over the history of nature as a single one over the life of man.    It is of interest to compare the honey-bee of the hive with the great  tribe of \"Apiens,\" which includes all the wild bees. We shall discover  differences more extraordinary than those that exist among men. But let  us merely, for the moment, consider what is known as the domestic bee,  of which there are sixteen different kinds, all, the largest as the  smallest, exactly alike, except for the slight modifications caused by  the climate or the conditions in which they exist. The difference  between them, in appearance, is no greater than between an Englishman  and a Russian, a European or a Japanese.      Bees do not, like ourselves, dwell in towns that are open to the sky and  exposed to the caprice of rain and storm, but in cities that are  entirely covered with a protecting envelope. If they were guided solely  by their instinct, they would build their combs in the air. In the  Indies we find that they do not even seek a hollow tree or a cleft in  the rocks. The swarm will hang down from the branch of a tree, and the  comb will be lengthened, the queen's eggs laid, provisions stored, with  no shelter other than that which the workers' own bodies provide. Our  Northern bees have at times been known to do this, deceived perhaps by a  too gentle sky; and swarms have been found living in the center of a  bush.
