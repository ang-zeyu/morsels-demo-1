Inhabited? (#13)"],[1,"the torrid, temperate, and frigid zones have  almost the same proportions. The length of the day is also nearly the same  for both, the Martian day being slightly longer; but the most serious  factor is the greater distance of Mars, and the consequent diminution in  the light and heat received from the Sun. The light and heat received by  the Earth are not so excessive that we could be content to see them  diminished, even by 5 per cent, but for Mars they are diminished by 57 per  cent. How can we judge the effect of so important a difference?    The mean temperature of our Earth is supposed to be about 60 deg.F., or 16 deg.C.  Three-sevenths of this would give us 7 deg.C. as the mean temperature of Mars,  which would signify a planet not impossible for life. But the zero of the  Centigrade scale is not the absolute zero; it only marks the  freezing-point of water. The absolute zero is computed to be -273 deg. on the  Centigrade scale; the temperature of the Earth on the absolute scale  therefore should be taken as 289 deg., and three-sevenths of this would give  124 deg. of absolute temperature. But this is 149 deg. below freezing-point, and  no life could exist on a planet under such conditions.    But the mean temperature of Mars cannot be computed quite so easily. The  hotter a body is the more rapidly it radiates heat; the cooler it is the  slower its radiation. According to Stefan's Law, the radiation varies for  a perfect radiator with the 4th power of the absolute temperature; so that  if Mars were at 124 deg. abs., while the Earth were at 289 deg. abs., the Earth  would be radiating its heat nearly 30 times faster than Mars. The heat  income of Mars would therefore be in a much higher proportion than its  expenditure; and necessarily its heat capital would increase until income  and expenditure balanced. Prof. Poynting has made the temperature of the  planets under the 4th power law of radiation the subject of an interesting  enquiry, and the figures which he has obtained for Mars and other planets  are included in the Table.    The equatorial and average temperatures are given under the assumption  that Mars possesses an atmosphere as efficient as our own in equalizing  the temperature of the whole planet. If, on the other hand, its atmosphere  has no such regulating power, then under the zenith Sun the upper limit of  the temperature of a portion of its surface reflecting one-eighth would  be, as shown in the Table, 64 deg.C. This would imply that the temperature on  the dark side of the planet was very nearly at the absolute zero. \"If we  regard Mars as resembling our Moon, and take the Moon's effective average  temperature as 297 deg. abs., the corresponding temperature for Mars is 240 deg.  abs., and the highest temperature is four-fifths of 337 deg. = 270 deg. abs. But  the surface of Mars has probably a higher coefficient of absorption than  the surface of the Moon--it certainly has for light--so that we may put  his effective average temperature, on this supposition, some few degrees  above 240 deg. abs., and his equatorial temperature some degrees higher still.  It appears as exceedingly probable, then, that whether we regard Mars as  like the Earth or, going to the other extreme, as like the Moon, the  temperature of his surface is everywhere below the freezing-point of  water.\"[14] As the atmospheric circulation on Mars must be languid, and  the atmosphere itself is very rare, the general condition of the planet  will approximate rather to the lunar type than to the terrestrial, and the  extremes, both of heat and cold, will approach those which would prevail  on a planet without a regulating atmosphere.    There is another way of considering the effect on the climate of Mars and  its great distance from the Sun, which, though only rough and crude, may  be helpful to some readers. If we take the Earth at noonday at the time of  the equinox, then a square yard at the equator has the Sun in its zenith,  and is fully presented to its light and heat. But, as we move away from  the equator, we find that each higher latitude is less fully presented to  the Sun, until, when we reach latitude 64-1/2 deg.--in other words just  outside the Arctic Circle--7 square yards are presented to the Sun so as  to receive only as much of the solar radiation as 3 square yards receive  at the equator. We may take, then, latitude 64-1/2 deg. as representing Mars,  while the equator represents the Earth. Or, we may take it that we should  compare the climate of Archangel with the climate of Singapore.    Now the mean temperature of latitude 64-1/2 deg., say the latitude of  Archangel, is just about freezing-point (0 deg.C.), while that of the equator  is about 28 deg.C. We should therefore expect from this a difference between  the mean temperatures of the Earth and Mars of 28 deg.; that is to say, as the  Earth stands at 16 deg.C, Mars would be at -12 deg.C. But, on the Earth, the  evaporation and precipitation is great, and the atmospheric circulation  vigorous. Evaporation is always going on in equatorial regions, and the  moisture-laden winds are continually moving polewards, carrying with them  vast stores of heat to be liberated as the rain falls. The oceanic  currents have the same effect, and how great the modification which they  introduce may be seen by comparing the climates of Labrador and Scotland.  There appear to be no great oceans on Mars. The difference of 28 deg. which we  find on the Earth between the equator and the edge of the Arctic Circle is  a difference which remains after the convection currents of air and sea  have done much to reduce the temperature of the equator and to raise that  of high latitudes. If we suppose that their effect has been to reduce this  difference to one half of what it would have been were each latitude  isolated from the rest, we shall not be far wrong, and we should get a  range of 56 deg. as the true equivalent difference between the mean  temperatures of Singapore and Archangel; i.e. of the Earth and Mars; and  Mars would stand at -40 deg.C. The closeness with which this figure agrees  with that reached by Prof. Poynting suggests that it is a fair  approximation to the correct figure.    The size of Mars taught us that we have in it a planet with an atmosphere  of but one half the density of that prevailing on the top of our highest  mountain; the distance of Mars from the Sun showed us that it must have a  mean temperature close to that of freezing mercury. What chance would  there be for life on a world the average condition of which would  correspond to that of a terrestrial mountain top, ten miles high and in  the heart of the polar regions? But Mars in the telescope does not look  like a cold planet. As we look at it, and note its bright colour, the  small extent of the white caps presumed to be snow, and the high latitudes  in which the dark markings--presumed to be water or vegetation--are seen,  it seems difficult to suppose that the mean temperature of the planet is  lower than that of the Earth. Thus on the wonderful photographs taken by  Prof. Barnard in 1909, the Nilosyrtis with the Protonilus is seen as a  dark canal. Now the Protonilus is in North Lat. 42 deg., and on the date of  observation--September 28, 1909--the winter solstice of the northern  hemisphere of Mars was just past. There would be nothing unusual for the  ground to be covered with snow and the water to be frozen in a  corresponding latitude if in a continental situation on the Earth. Then,  again, in the summer, the white polar caps of Mars diminish to a far  greater extent than the snow and ice caps of the Earth; indeed, one of the  Martian caps has been known to disappear completely.    Yet, as the accompanying diagram will show, something of this kind is  precisely what we ought to expect to see. The diagram has been constructed  in the following manner: A curve of mean temperatures has been laid down  for every 10 deg. of latitude on the Earth, derived as far as possible from  accepted isothermals in continental countries in the northern hemisphere.  From this curve ordinates have been drawn at each 10 deg., upward to show  average deviation from the mean temperature for the hottest part of the  day in summer, downward for the deviation for the coldest part of the  night in winter. Obviously, on the average, the range from maximum to  minimum will increase from the equator to the poles. The mean temperature  of the Earth has been taken as 16 deg.C, and as representing that prevailing  in about 42 deg. lat. The diagram shows that the maximum temperature of no  place upon the Earth's surface approaches the boiling-point of water, and  that it is only within the polar circle that the mean temperature is below  freezing-point. Water, therefore, on the Earth must be normally in the  liquid state.    In constructing a similar diagram for Mars, three modifications have to be  made. First of all, the mean temperature of the planet must be  considerably lower than that of the Earth. Next, since the atmospheric  circulation is languid and there are no great oceans, the temperatures of  different latitudes cannot be equalized to the same extent as on the  Earth. It follows, therefore, that the range in mean temperature from  equator to pole must be considerably greater on Mars than on the Earth.  Thirdly, the range in temperature in any latitude, from the hottest part  of the day in summer to the coldest part of the night in winter, must be  much greater than with us; partly on account of the very slight density of  the atmosphere, and partly on account of the length of the Martian year.      [Illustration: THERMOGRAPHS OF THE EARTH AND MARS]      We cannot know the exact figures to adopt, but the general type of the  thermograph for Mars as compared with that of the Earth will remain. The  mean temperature of Mars will be lower, the range of temperature from  equator to pole will"]]]
