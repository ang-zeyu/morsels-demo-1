Is it not true, Sir, that the romance is the prose epic       of modern society, and that we now look to its pages       for the most graphic portraitures of men, manners, and       events? Social and political life is too complex now       for the stately march of the heroic poem, and this age       of print needs not the carefully measured verse to make       sentences musical to the ear, or to save them from       being mutilated by circulation. The romance is now the       chosen form of imaginative literature, and its gifted       masters are educators of the popular ideal. What epic       poem of our times begins to compare in influence over       the common mind with the stories of Scott and Cooper?       Our novelist loved most to treat of scenes and       characters distinctively national, and his name stands       indelibly written on our fairest lakes and rivers, our       grandest seas and mountains, our annals of early       sacrifice and daring. With some of his criticisms on       society, and some of his views of political and       historical questions, I have personally little       sympathy. But, when it is asked, in the impartial       standard of critical justice, what influence has he       exerted over the moral tone of American literature, or       to what aim has he wielded the fascinating pen of       romance, there can be but one reply. With him, fancy       has always walked hand in hand with purity, and the       ideal of true manhood, which is everywhere most       prominent in his works, is one of which we may well be       proud as a nation and as men.         The element of will, perhaps more strongly than       intellectual analysis, or exquisite sensibility, or       high imagination, is the distinguished characteristic       of his heroes, and in this his portraitures are good       types of what is strongest in the practical American       mind. His model man, whether forester, sailor, servant,       or gentleman, is always bent on bringing some especial       thing to pass, and the progress from the plan to the       achievement is described with military or naval       exactness. Yet he never overlooks any of the essential       traits of a noble manhood, and loves to show how much       of enterprise, courage, compassion, and reverence, it       combines with practical judgment and religious       principle.         It has seemed to me that his stories of the seas and       the forests are fitted to act more than ever upon the       strong hearts in training for the new spheres of       triumph which are now so wonderfully opening upon our       people. Who does not wish that his noted hero of the       backwoods might be known in every loghouse along our       extending frontier, and teach the rough pioneer always       to temper daring by humanity? Who can ever forget that       favorite character, as dear to the reader as to the       author--that paladin of the forest, that lion-heart of       the wilderness, Leatherstocking, fearless towards       man--gentle towards woman--a rough-cast gentleman of       as true a heart as ever beat under the red cross of the       crusader. The very qualities needed in those old times       of frontier strife are now needed for new emergencies       in our more peaceful border life, and our future       depends vastly upon the characters that give edge to       the advancing mass of our population now crowding       towards the rocky mountains and the Pacific coast. It       is well that this story-teller of the forest has been       so true to the best traits of our nature, and in so       many points is a moralist too. As a romancer of the       sea, Cooper's genius may perhaps be but beginning to       show its influence, as a new age of commercial       greatness is opening upon our nation.         Mr. Cooper did not shrink from battle scenes and had no       particular dread of gunpowder, yet his best laurels       upon the ocean have been won in describing feats of       seamanship and traits of manhood that need no bloody       conflict for their display, and may be exemplified in       fleets as peaceful and beneficent as ever spread their       sails to the breezes to bear kindly products to       friendly nations. As we sit here this evening under the       influence of the hour, the images of many a famous       exploit on the water seems to come out from his       well-remembered pages and mingle themselves with recent       scenes of marine achievement. Has not the \"Water Witch\"       herself reappeared of late in our own bay, and laden       not with contraband goods, but a freight of       stout-hearted gentlemen, borne the palm as \"Skimmer of       the Seas,\" from all competitors in presence of the       royalty and nobility of England? And the Old Ironsides,       has not she come back again, more iron-ribbed than       ever--not to fight over the old battles which our naval       chronicler was so fond of rehearsing, but under the       name of the Baltic or (better omen) the Pacific, to win       a victory more honorable and encouraging than ever was       carried by the thundering broadsides of the noble old       Constitution! The commanders and pilots so celebrated       by the novelist, have they not successors indomitable       as they? and just now our ship-news brings good tidings       of their achievements, as they tell us of the Flying       Cloud that has made light of the storms of the fearful       southern cape, and of the return of the adventurous       fleet that has stood so well the hug of the Polar       icebergs, and shown how nobly a crew may hunt for men       on the seas with a Red Rover's daring and a Christian's       mercy.         It is well that the most gifted romancer of the sea is       an American, and that he is helping us to enact the       romance of history so soon to be fact. The empire of       the waters, which in turn has belonged to Tyre, Venice,       and England, seems waiting to come to America, and no       part of the world now so justly claims its possession       as that state in which Cooper had his home. Who does       not welcome the promise of the new age of powerful       commerce and mental blessing? Who does not feel       grateful to any man who gives any good word or work to       the emancipation of the sailor from his worst enemies,       and to the freedom of the seas from all the violence       that stains its benignant waters? While proud of our       fleet ships, let us not forget elements in their       equipment more important than oak and iron. In this age       of merchandise, let us adorn peace with something of       the old manhood that took from warfare some of its       horrors. Did time allow, I might try to illustrate the       power of an attractive literature in keeping alive       national associations and moulding national character,       but I am content to leave these few fragmentary words       with the society as my poor tribute to a writer who       charmed many hours of my boyhood, and who has won       regard anew as the entertaining and instructive       beguiler of some recent days of rural recreation. May       we not sincerely say that he has so used the treasures       of our national scenery and history as to elevate the       true ideal of true manhood, and quicken the nation's       memory in many respects auspiciously for the nation's       hopes?    It is understood that a public discourse on the life and genius of Mr.  Cooper will be delivered by one of the most eminent of his contemporaries,  at Tripler Hall, early in December, and that measures will be adopted to  secure the erection of a suitable monument to his memory in one of the  public squares or parks of the city. On this subject Mr. Washington Irving  has written the following letter:                                  SUNNYSIDE, October, 1851.         MY DEAR SIR:--My occupations in the country prevent my       attendance in town at the meeting of the committee, but       I am anxious to know what is doing. I signified at our       first meeting what I thought the best monument to the       memory of Mr. Cooper--a statue. It is the simplest,       purest, and most satisfactory--perpetuating the       likeness of the person. I understand there is an       excellent bust of Mr. Cooper extant, made when he was       in Italy. He was there in his prime; and it might       furnish the model for a noble statue. Judge Duer       suggested that his monument should be placed at       Washington, perhaps in the Smithsonian Institute. I was       rather for New-York, as he belonged to this State, and       the scenes of several of his best works were laid in       it. Besides, the seat of government may be changed, and       then Washington would lose its importance; whereas       New-York must always be a great and growing       metropolis--the place of arrival and departure for this       part of the world--the great resort of strangers from       abroad, and of our own people from all parts of the       Union. One of our beautiful squares would be a fine       situation for a statue. However, I am perhaps a little       too local in my notions on this matter. Cooper       emphatically belongs to the nation, and his monument       should be placed where it would be most in public view.       Judge Duer's idea therefore may be the best. There will       be a question of what material the statue (if a statue       is determined on) should be made. White marble is the       most beautiful, but how would it stand our climate in       the open air? Bronze stands all weathers and all       climates, but does not give so clearly the expression       of the countenance, when regarded from a little       distance.         These are all suggestions scrawled in haste, which I       should have made if able to attend the meeting of the     "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37937"],[0,"A Wanderer in Paris (#13)"],[1,"let us leave  the Carnavalet.    The Rue de Sevigne itself has many interesting houses, notably on the  south side of the Rue des Francs Bourgeois; No. 11, for example, was  once a theatre, built by Beaumarchais in 1790. That is nothing; the  interesting thing is that he built it of material from the destroyed  Bastille and the destroyed church of St. Paul. The fire station close  by was once the Hotel de Perron de Quincy. It was in this street, on  the day of the Fete Dieu in 1392, that the Constable de Clisson, whose  house we saw in the Rue des Archives, was attacked by Pierre de Craon.    The Rue des Francs Bourgeois is the highway of the Marais, and the  Carnavalet is its greatest possession; but, as I have said, the Marais  is inexhaustible in architectural and historical riches. We may work  our way through it, back to the Rue du Temple by any of these ancient  streets; all will repay. The Rue du Temple extends to the Rue de  Rivoli, striking it just by the Hotel de Ville, but the lower portion,  south of the Rue Rambuteau, is not so interesting as the upper. There  is, however, to the west of it, just north of the Rue de Rivoli, a  system of old streets hardly less picturesque (and sometimes even  more so) than the Marais proper, in the centre of which is the church  of St. Merry, with one of the most wonderful west fronts anywhere--a  mass of rich and eccentric decoration. The Saint himself was Abbot of  Autun. He came to Paris in the seventh century to visit the shrines of  St. Denis and St. Germain. At that time the district which we are now  traversing was chiefly forest, in which the kings of France would  hunt, leaving their palace in the Ile de la Cite and crossing the  river to this wild district--wild though so near. St. Merry  established himself in his simple way near a little chapel in the  woods, dedicated to St. Peter, that stood on this spot, and there he  died. After his death his tomb in the chapel performed such miracles  that St. Peter was forgotten and St. Merry was exalted, and when the  time came to rebuild, St. Merry ousted St. Peter altogether.      [Illustration: THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE DE L'ETOILE      (APPROACHING FROM THE AVENUE DU BOIS DE BOULOGNE)]    St. Merry's florid west front is in the Rue St. Martin, once the Roman  road from Paris to the north and to England, and by the Rue St. Martin  we may leave this district; but between it and the Rue du Temple there  is much to see--such as, for example, the Rue Verrerie, south of St.  Merry's, the head-quarters of the ancient glassworkers; the Rue  Brisemiche, quite one of the best of the old narrow Paris streets,  with iron staples and hooks still in the walls at Nos. 20, 23, 26 and  29, to which chains could be fastened so as to turn a street into an  impasse during times of stress and thus be sure of your man; the Rue  Taillepin, also leading out of the Rue du Cloitre St. Merry into the  Rue St. Merri, which has some fine old houses of its own, notably No.  36 and the quaint Impasse du Boeuf at No. 10.    Parallel with the Rue St. Merry farther north is the Rue de Venise,  which the Vicomte de Villebresme boldly calls the most picturesque in  old Paris. Now a very low quarter, it was once literally the Lombard  Street of Paris, the chief abode of Lombardy moneylenders, while the  long and beautiful Rue Quincampoix, into which it runs on the west,  was also a financial centre, containing no less an establishment than  the famous Banque of John Law, the Scotchman who for a while early in  the eighteenth century controlled French finance. When Law had matured  his Mississippi scheme, he made the Rue Quincampoix his head-quarters,  and houses in it, we read, that had been let for L40 a year now  yielded L800 a month. In the winter of 1719-20 Paris was filled with  speculators besieging Law's offices for shares. But by May the crash  had come and Law had to fly. Many a house in the Rue Quincampoix,  which is now sufficiently innocent of high finance, dates from the  fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. There is a fine doorway at No. 34.    We may regain the Rue St. Martin, just to the east, by the Rue des  Lombards, which brings us to the flamboyant front of St. Merry's once  more. The Rue St. Martin, which confesses its Roman origin in its  straightness, is still busy with traffic, but neither itself nor the  Rue St. Denis, two or three hundred yards to the west, is one-tenth  as busy as it was before the Boulevard Sebastopol was cut between them  to do all the real work. It is a fine thoroughfare and no doubt of the  highest use, but what beautiful narrow streets of old houses it must  have destroyed! We may note in the Rue St. Martin the pretty fountain  at No. 122, and the curious old house at No. 164, and leave it at the  church of St. Nicholas-des-Champs, no longer in the fields any more  than London's St. Martin's is.    And now after so many houses let us see some pictures!          CHAPTER VI    THE LOUVRE: I. THE OLD MASTERS         The Winged Victory of Samothrace--Botticelli's       Fresco--Luini--Ingres--The Salon Carre--La Joconde--Leonardo       da Vinci--Pater, Lowell and Vasari--Early Collectors--Paul       Veronese--Copyists--The Salle des Primitifs--The Grande       Galerie--Landor's Pictorial Creed--The Great       Schools--Rembrandt--Van Dyck and Rubens--Amazing       Abundance--The Dutch Masters--The Drawings.      It is on the first landing of the Escalier Daru, at the end of the  Galerie Denon, that one of the most priceless treasures of the  Louvre--one of the most splendid things in the world--is to be found:  it has been before us all the way along the Galerie Denon, that avenue  of noble bronzes, the first thing that caught the eye: I mean the  \"Winged Victory of Samothrace\". Every one has seen photographs or  models of this majestic and exquisite figure, but it must be studied  here if one is to form a true estimate of the magical mastery of the  sculptor. The Victory is headless and armless and much mutilated; but  that matters little. She stands on the prow of a trireme, and for  every one who sees her with any imagination must for all time be the  symbol of triumphant and splendid onset. The figure no doubt weighs  more than a ton--and is as light as air. The \"Meteor\" in a strong  breeze with all her sails set and her prow foaming through the waves  does not convey a more exciting idea of commanding and buoyant  progress. But that comparison wholly omits the element of  conquest--for this is essential Victory as well.    The statue dates from the fourth century B.C. It was not discovered  until 1863, in Samothrace. Paris is fortunate indeed to possess not  only the Venus of Milo but this wonder of art--both in the same  building.    Before entering the picture galleries proper, let us look at two other  exceedingly beautiful things also on this staircase--the two frescoes  from the Villa Lemmi, but particularly No. 1297 on the left of the  entrance to Gallery XVI., which represents Giovanna Tornabuoni and the  Cardinal Virtues, and is by Sandro Filipepi, whom we call Botticelli.  For this exquisite work alone would I willingly cross the Channel even  in a gale, such is its charm. A reproduction of it will be found  opposite page 20, but it gives no impression of the soft delicacy of  colouring: its gentle pinks and greens and purples, its kindly reds  and chestnut browns. One should make a point of looking at these  frescoes whenever one is on the staircase, which will be often.    The ordinary entrance to the picture galleries of the Louvre is  through the photographic vestibule on the right of the Winged Victory  as you face it, leading to the Salle Duchatel, notable for such  differing works as frescoes by Luini and two pictures by  Ingres--representing the beginning and end of his long and austere  career. The Luinis are delightful--very gay and, as always with this  tender master, sweet--especially \"The Nativity,\" which is reproduced  opposite page 16. The Ingres' (which were bequeathed by the Comtesse  Duchatel after whom the room is named) are the \"OEdipus solving the  riddle of the Sphinx,\" dated 1808, when the painter was twenty-eight,  and the \"Spring,\" which some consider his masterpiece, painted in  1856. He lived to be eighty-six. English people have so few  opportunities of seeing the work of this master (we have in oils only  a little doubtful portrait of Malibran, very recently acquired, which  hangs in the National Gallery) that he comes as a totally new  craftsman to most of us; and his severity may not always please. But  as a draughtsman he almost takes the breath away, and no one should  miss the pencil heads, particularly a little saucy lady, from his hand  in the His de la Salle collection of drawings in another part of the  Louvre.    In the Salle Duchatel is also a screen of drawings with a very  beautiful head by Botticelli in it--No. 48. From the rooms we then  pass to the Salon Carre (so called because it is square, and not, as I  heard one American explaining to another, after the celebrated  collector Carre who had left these pictures to the nation), and this  is, I suppose, for its size, the most valuable gallery in the world.  It is doubtful if any other combination of collections, each  contributing of its choicest, could compile as remarkable a room, for  the \"Monna Lisa,\" or \"La Joconde,\" Leonardo da Vinci's portrait of the  wife of his friend Francesco del Giocondo, which is its greatest glory  and perhaps the greatest glory of all Paris too, would necessarily be  missing.      [Illustration: THE WINGED VICTORY OF SAMOTHRACE      _(Louvre)_]    Paris without this picture would not be the Paris that we know, or the  Paris that has been since 1793 when \"La Joconde\" first became the  nation's property--ever more to smile her inscrutable smile and exert  her quiet mysterious sway, not only for kings and courtiers but for  all. When all is said, it is Leonardo who"]]]
