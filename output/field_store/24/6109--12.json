Unknown, untried, those squadrons were, but proudly out they drew    Beside the English regiments that fought at Waterloo.    From every coast, from every clime, they met in proud array,    To go with French to Kimberley to drive the Boers away.      He crossed the Reit and fought his way towards the Modder bank.    The foemen closed behind his march, and hung upon the flank.    The long, dry grass was all ablaze, and fierce the veldt fire runs;    He fought them through a wall of flame that blazed around the guns!    Then limbered up and drove at speed, though horses fell and died;    We might not halt for man nor beast on that wild, daring ride.    Black with the smoke and parched with thirst, we pressed the livelong day    Our headlong march to Kimberley to drive the Boers away.      We reached the drift at fall of night, and camped across the ford.    Next day from all the hills around the Dutchman's cannons roared.    A narrow pass between the hills, with guns on either side;    The boldest man might well turn pale before that pass he tried,    For if the first attack should fail then every hope was gone:    But French looked once, and only once, and then he said, 'Push on!'    The gunners plied their guns amain; the hail of shrapnel flew;    With rifle fire and lancer charge their squadrons back we threw;    And through the pass between the hills we swept in furious fray,    And French was through to Kimberley to drive the Boers away.      Ay, French was through to Kimberley!  And ere the day was done    We saw the Diamond City stand, lit by the evening sun:    Above the town the heliograph hung like an eye of flame:    Around the town the foemen camped -- they knew not that we came;    But soon they saw us, rank on rank; they heard our squadrons' tread;    In panic fear they left their tents, in hopeless rout they fled;    And French rode into Kimberley; the people cheered amain,    The women came with tear-stained eyes to touch his bridle rein,    The starving children lined the streets to raise a feeble cheer,    The bells rang out a joyous peal to say 'Relief is here!'    Ay! we that saw that stirring march are proud that we can say    We went with French to Kimberley to drive the Boers away.          Johnny Boer          Men fight all shapes and sizes as the racing horses run,    And no man knows his courage till he stands before a gun.    At mixed-up fighting, hand to hand, and clawing men about    They reckon Fuzzy-wuzzy is the hottest fighter out.    But Fuzzy gives himself away -- his style is out of date,    He charges like a driven grouse that rushes on its fate;    You've nothing in the world to do but pump him full of lead:    But when you're fighting Johnny Boer you have to use your head;    He don't believe in front attacks or charging at the run,    He fights you from a kopje with his little Maxim gun.      For when the Lord He made the earth, it seems uncommon clear,    He gave the job of Africa to some good engineer,    Who started building fortresses on fashions of his own --    Lunettes, redoubts, and counterscarps all made of rock and stone.    The Boer needs only bring a gun, for ready to his hand    He finds these heaven-built fortresses all scattered through the land;    And there he sits and winks his eye and wheels his gun about,    And we must charge across the plain to hunt the beggar out.    It ain't a game that grows on us, there's lots of better fun    Than charging at old Johnny with his little Maxim gun.      On rocks a goat could scarcely climb, steep as the walls of Troy,    He wheels a four-point-seven about as easy as a toy;    With bullocks yoked and drag-ropes manned, he lifts her up the rocks    And shifts her every now and then, as cunning as a fox.    At night you mark her right ahead, you see her clean and clear,    Next day at dawn -- 'What, ho! she bumps' -- from somewhere in the rear.    Or else the keenest-eyed patrol will miss him with the glass --    He's lying hidden in the rocks to let the leaders pass;    But when the main guard comes along he opens up the fun,    There's lots of ammunition for the little Maxim gun.      But after all the job is sure, although the job is slow,    We have to see the business through, the Boer has got to go.    With Nordenfeldt and lyddite shell it's certain, soon or late,    We'll hunt him from his kopjes and across the Orange State;    And then across those open flats you'll see the beggar run,    And we'll be running after with OUR little Maxim gun.          What Have the Cavalry Done          What have the cavalry done?    Cantered and trotted about,    Routin' the enemy out,    Causin' the beggars to run!    And we tramped along in the blazin' heat,    Over the veldt on our weary feet.    Tramp, tramp, tramp    Under the blazin' sun,    With never the sight of a bloomin' Boer,    'Cause they'd hunted 'em long before --    That's what the cavalry done!      What have the gunners done    Battlin' every day,    Battlin' any way.    Boers outranged 'em, but what cared they?    'Shoot and be damned,' said the R.H.A.!    See! when the fight grows hot,    Under the rifles or not,    Always the order runs,    'Fetch up the bloomin' guns!'      And you'd see them great gun-horses spring    To the 'action front' -- and around they'd swing.    Find the range with some queer machine    'At four thousand with fuse fourteen.    Ready!  Fire number one!'    Handled the battery neat and quick!    Stick to it, too!  How DID they stick!    Never a gunner was seen to run!    Never a gunner would leave his gun!    Not though his mates dropped all around!    Always a gunner would stand his ground.    Take the army -- the infantry,    Mounted rifles, and cavalry,    Twice the numbers I'd give away,    And I'd fight the lot with the R.H.A.,    For they showed us how a corps SHOULD be run,    That's what the gunners done!          Right in the Front of the Army          'Where 'ave you been this week or more,    'Aven't seen you about the war?    Thought perhaps you was at the rear    Guarding the waggons.'  'What, us?  No fear!    Where have we been?  Why, bless my heart,    Where have we been since the bloomin' start?        Right in the front of the army,         Battling day and night!        Right in the front of the army,         Teaching 'em how to fight!'        Every separate man you see,        Sapper, gunner, and C.I.V.,        Every one of 'em seems to be         Right in the front of the army!      Most of the troops to the camp had gone,    When we met with a cow-gun toiling on;    And we said to the boys, as they walked her past,    'Well, thank goodness, you're here at last!'    'Here at last!  Why, what d'yer mean?    Ain't we just where we've always been?        Right in the front of the army,         Battling day and night!        Right in the front of the army,         Teaching 'em how to fight!'        Correspondents and vets. in force,        Mounted foot and dismounted horse,        All of them were, as a matter of course,         Right in the front of the army.      Old Lord Roberts will have to mind    If ever the enemy get behind;    For they'll smash him up with a rear attack,    Because his army has got no back!    Think of the horrors that might befall    An army without any rear at all!        Right in the front of the army,         Battling day and night!        Right in the front of the army,         Teaching 'em how to fight!        Swede attaches and German counts,        Yeomen (known as De Wet's remounts),        All of them were by their own accounts         Right in the front of the army!          That V.C.          'Twas in the days of front attack,     This glorious truth we'd yet to learn it --    That every 'front' had got a back,     And French was just the man to turn it.      A wounded soldier on the ground     Was lying hid behind a hummock;    He proved the good old proverb sound --     An army travels on its stomach.      He lay as flat as any fish,     His nose had worn a little furrow;    He only had one frantic wish,     That like an antbear he could burrow.      The bullets whistled into space,     The pom-pom gun kept up its braying,    The four-point-seven supplied the bass --     You'd think the devil's band was playing.      A valiant comrade crawling near     Observed his most supine behaviour,    And crept towards him, 'Hey! what cheer?     Buck up,' said he, 'I've come to save yer.      'You get up on my shoulders, mate,     And if we live beyond the firing,    I'll get the V.C. sure as fate,     Because our blokes is all retiring.      'It's fifty pounds a year,' says he,     'I'll stand you lots of beer and whisky.'    'No,' says the wounded man, 'not me,     I'll not be saved, it's far too risky.      'I'm fairly safe behind this mound,     I've worn a hole that seems to fit me;    But if you lift me off the ground,     It's fifty pounds to one they'll hit me.'      So back towards the firing line     Our friend crept slowly to the rear oh!    Remarking 'What a selfish swine!     He might have let me be a hero.'          Fed Up          I ain't a timid man at all, I'm just as brave as most,    I'll take my chance in open fight and die beside my post;    But riding round the 'ole day long as target for a Krupp,    A-drawing fire from Koppies -- well, I'm fair fed up.      It's wonderful how few get hit, it's luck that pulls us through;    Their rifle fire's no class at all, it misses me and you;    But when they sprinkle shells around like water from a cup    From that there blooming pom-pom gun -- well, I'm fed up.      We never get a chance to charge, to do a thrust and cut,    I'll have to chuck the Cavalry and join the Mounted Fut.    But after all -- What's Mounted Fut?  I saw them t'other day,    They occupied a Koppie when the Boers had run away.    The Cavalry went riding on and seen a score of fights,    But there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30427"],[0,"The Lost Kafoozalum (#13)"],[1,"rushed straight off to  the site of the landing--they actually saw _Gilgamesh_, and she  registered on some of their astronomical instruments, too. They must  be a reckless lot. What's more, they started trying to locate her on  the sea bottom the next day. Found both pieces; they're still trying  to locate the nose. They were all set to try raising the smaller piece  when their governments both announced in some haste that they were  sending a properly equipped expedition. Jointly.    \"There's been no mention in any newscast of anyone seeing fairies or  sea maidens--I expect the poor devil thinks you were a hallucination.\"    So we brought it off.           *       *       *       *       *    I am very thankful in a distant sort of way, but right now the  Incognitans have no more reality for me than the Lost Kafoozalum.    M'Clare came through alive.    I could spend a good deal of time just getting used to that fact, but  there is something I ought to say and I don't know how.    I inquire after his injuries and learn they are healing nicely.    I look at him and he is frowning.    He says, \"Lizzie. Just before my well-meant but ineffective attempt at  suicide--\"    Here it comes.    I say quick If he is worrying about all that nonsense he talked in  order to distract my attention, forget it; I have.    Silence, then he says wearily, \"I talked nonsense, did I?\"    I say there is no need to worry, under the circumstances anyone would  have a perfect right to be raving off his Nut.    I then find I cannot bear this conversation any longer so I get up  saying I expect he is tired and I will call someone.    I get nearly to the door when    \"_No_, Lizzie! you can't let that crew loose on me just in order to  change the conversation. Come back here. I appreciate your wish to  spare my feelings, but it's wasted. We'll have this out here and now.    \"I remember quite well what I said, and so do you: I said that I loved  you. I also said that I had intended to ask you to marry me as soon as  you ceased to be one of my pupils. Well, the results of Finals were  officially announced three days ago.    \"Oh, I suppose I always knew what the answer would be, but I didn't  want to spend the rest of my life wondering, because I never had the  guts to ask you.    \"You don't dislike me as you used to--you've forgiven me for making  you come to Russett--but you still think I'm a cold-blooded  manipulator of other people's minds and emotions. So I am; it's part  of the job.    \"You're quite right to distrust me for that, though. It is the danger  of this profession, that we end up by looking on everybody and  everything as a subject for manipulation. Even in our personal lives.  I always knew that: I didn't begin to be afraid of it until I realized  I was in love with you.    \"I could have made you love me, Lizzie. I could! I didn't try. Not  that I didn't want love on those terms, or any terms. But to use  professional ... tricks ... in private life, ends by destroying all  reality. I always treated you exactly as I treated my other  students--I think. But I could have made you think you loved me ...  even if I am twice your age--\"    This I cannot let pass, I say \"Hi! According to College rumor you  cannot be more than thirty-six; I'm twenty-three.\"    M'Clare says in a bemused sort of way He will be thirty-seven in a  couple of months.    I say, \"I will be twenty-four next week and your arithmetic is still  screwy; and here is another datum you got wrong. I do love you. Very  much.\"    He says, \"Golden Liz.\"    Then other things which I remember all right, I shall keep them to  remember any time I am tired, sick, cold, hungry Hundred-and-ninety--;  but they are not for writing down.    Then I suppose at some point we agreed it is time for me to go,  because I find myself outside the cabin and there is Colonel  Delano-Smith.    He makes me a small speech about various matters ending that he hears  he has to congratulate me.    Huh?    Oh, Space and Time did one of those unimitigated so-and-sos, my dear  classmates, leave M'Clare's communicator on?    The colonel says he heard I did very well in my Examinations.    Sweet splitting photons I forgot all about Finals.    It is just as well my Education has come to an honorable end, because ...  well, shades of ... well, Goodness gracious and likewise Dear me, I am  going to marry a _Professor_.    Better just stick to it I am going to marry M'Clare, it makes better  sense that way.    But Gosh we are going to have to do some re-adjusting to a changed  Environment. Both of us.    Oh, well, M'Clare is a Professor of Cultural Engineering and I just  past my Final Exams in same; surely if anyone can we should be able to  work out how you live Happily Ever After?           *       *       *       *       *"]]]
