And surpassingly beautiful were the Maidens clothed in the white cotton  and embroidered garments of Summer-land.    Then after long praying and chanting by the priests, the fathers of the  people, and those of the Seed and Water, and the keepers of sacred  things, the Maiden-mother of the North advanced to the foot of the  ladder. She lifted from her head the beautiful tray of yellow corn and  Paiyatama took it. He pointed it to the regions, each in turn, and the  Priest of the North came and received the tray of sacred seed.    Then the Maiden of the West advanced and gave up her tray of blue corn.  So each in turn the Maidens gave up their trays of precious seed. The  Maiden of the South, the red seed; the Maiden of the East, the white  seed; then the Maiden with the black seed, and lastly, the tray of  all-color seed which the Priestess of Seed-and-All herself received.    And now, behold! The Maidens stood as before, she of the North at the  northern end, but with her face southward far looking; she of the West,  next, and lo! so all of them, with the seventh and last, looking  southward. And standing thus, the darkness of the night fell around  them. As shadows in deep night, so these Maidens of the Seed of Corn,  the beloved and beautiful, were seen no more of men. And Paiyatuma stood  alone, for Shutsukya walked now behind the Maidens, whistling shrilly,  as the frost wind whistles when the corn is gathered away, among the  lone canes and dry leaves of a gleaned field.    (7) Dew drops.          Hasjelti and Hostjoghon  Navajo (New Mexico)    Hasjelti was the son of the white corn, and Hostjoghon the son of the  yellow corn. They were born on the mountains where the fogs meet. These  two became the great song-makers of the world.    To the mountain where they were born (Henry Mountain, Utah), they gave  two songs and two prayers. Then they went to Sierra Blanca (Colorado)  and made two songs and prayers and dressed the mountain in clothing of  white shell with two eagle plumes upon its head. They visited San Mateo  Mountain (New Mexico) and gave to it two songs and prayers, and dressed  it in turquoise, even to leggings and moccasins, and placed two eagle  plumes upon its head. Then they went to San Francisco Mountain (Arizona)  and made two songs and prayers and dressed that mountain in abalone  shells with two eagle plumes upon its head. They then visited Ute  Mountain and gave to it two songs and prayers and dressed it in black  beads. Then they returned to their own mountain where the fogs meet and  said, \"We two have made all these songs.\"    Other brothers were born of the white corn and yellow corn, and two  brothers were placed on each mountain. They are the spirits of the  mountains and to them the clouds come first. All the brothers together  made game, the deer and elk and buffalo, and so game was created.    Navajos pray for rain and snow to Hasjelti and Hostjoghon. They stand  upon the mountain tops and call the clouds to gather around them.  Hasjelti prays to the sun, for the Navajos.    \"Father, give me the light of your mind that my mind may be strong. Give  me your strength, that my arm may be strong. Give me your rays, that  corn and other vegetation may grow.\"    The most important prayers are addressed to Hasjelti and the most  valuable gifts made to him. He talks to the Navajos through the birds,  and for this reason the choicest feathers and plumes are placed in the  cigarettes and attached to the prayer sticks offered to him.          The Song-Hunter  Navajo (New Mexico)    A man sat thinking. \"Let me see. My songs are too short. I want more  songs. Where shall I go to find them?\"    Hasjelti appeared and perceiving his thoughts, said, \"I know where you  can get more songs.\"    \"Well, I want to get more. So I will follow you.\"    They went to a certain point in a box canon in the Big Colorado River  and here they found four gods, the Hostjobokon, at work, hewing  cottonwood logs.    Hasjelti said, \"This will not do. Cottonwood becomes water-soaked. You  must use pine instead of cottonwood.\"    The Hostjobokon began boring the pine with flint, but Hasjelti said,  \"That is slow work.\" He commanded a whirlwind to hollow the log. A  cross, joining at the exact middle of each log, a solid one and the  hollow one, was formed. The arms of the cross were equal.    The song-hunter entered the hollow log and Hasjelti closed the end with  a cloud so that water would not enter when the logs were launched upon  the great waters. The logs floated off. The Hostjobokon, accompanied by  their wives, rode upon the logs, one couple sitting upon each arm.  Hasjelti, Hostjoghon, and the two Naaskiddi walked upon the banks to  keep the logs off shore. Hasjelti carried a squirrel skin filled with  tobacco, with which to supply the gods on their journey. Hostjoghon  carried a staff ornamented with eagle and turkey plumes and a gaming  ring with two humming birds tied to it with white cotton cord. The two  Naaskiddi carried staffs of lightning. The Naaskiddi had clouds upon  their backs in which the seeds of all corn and grasses were carried.    After floating a long distance down the river, they came to waters that  had a shore on one side only. Here they landed. Here they found a people  like themselves. When these people learned of the Song-hunter, they gave  him many songs and they painted pictures on a cotton blanket and said,    \"These pictures must go with the songs. If we give this blanket to you,  you will lose it. We will give you white earth and black coals which you  will grind together to make black paint, and we will give you white  sand, yellow sand, and red sand. For the blue paint you will take white  sand and black coals with a very little red and yellow sand. These will  give you blue.\"    And so the Navajo people make blue, even to this day.    The Song-hunter remained with these people until the corn was ripe.  There he learned to eat corn and he carried some back with him to the  Navajos, who had not seen corn before, and he taught them how to raise  it and how to eat it.    When he wished to return home, the logs would not float upstream. Four  sunbeams attached themselves to the logs, one to each cross arm, and so  drew the Song-hunter back to the box canon from which he had started.  When he reached that point, he separated the logs. He placed the end of  the solid log into the hollow end of the other and planted this great  pole in the river. It may be seen there to-day by the venturesome. In  early days many went there to pray and make offerings.          Sand Painting of the Song-Hunter  Navajo  (Explanatory of frontispiece)    The black cross bars denote pine logs; the white lines the froth of the  water; the yellow, vegetable debris gathered by the logs; the blue and  red lines, sunbeams. The blue spot in the centre of the cross denotes  water. There are four Hostjobokon, with their wives, the Hostjoboard.  Each couple sits upon one of the cross arms of the logs. The gods carry  in their right hands a rattle, and in their left sprigs of pinon; the  goddesses carry pinon sprigs in both hands.    Hasjelti is to the east of the painting. He carries a squirrel skin  filled with tobacco. His shirt is white cotton and very elastic. The  leggings are of white deerskin, fringed, and his head is ornamented with  an eagle's tail; at the tip of each plume there is a fluffy feather from  the breast of the eagle. The projection on the right of the throat is a  fox skin.    Hostjoghon is at the west. His shirt is invisible, the dark being the  dark of the body. His staff is colored black from a charred plant. Two  strips of beaver skin tipped with six quills of the porcupine are  attached to the right of the throat. The four colored stars on the body  are bead ornaments. The top of the staff is ornamented with a turkey's  tail. Eagle and turkey plumes are alternately attached to the staff.    The Naaskiddi are north and south of the painting. They carry staffs of  lightning ornamented with eagle plumes and sunbeams. Their bodies are  nude except the loin skirt. The hunch upon the back is a black cloud and  the three groups of white lines indicate corn and other seeds. Five  eagle plumes are attached to the cloud-back, since eagles live among the  clouds. The body is surrounded by sunlight. The lines of blue and red  which border the cloud-back denote sunbeams penetrating storm clouds.  The black circle zig-zagged with white around the head is a cloud basket  filled with corn and seeds of grass. On each side of the head are five  feathers of the red-shafted flicker.    The Rainbow goddess, upon which these gods often travel, partly  encircles and completes the picture.    These sand pictures are drawn upon common yellow sand, brought in  blankets and laid in squares about three inches thick and four feet in  diameter. The colors used in decoration were yellow, red, and white,  secured from sand stones, black from charcoal, and a grayish blue made  from white sand and charcoal mixed with a very small quantity of yellow  and red sands.

As soon as an  opportunity presented itself I asked General Joubert who was to be  second in command. My question was not answered directly, but egged on  by my colleagues, I asked whether General Botha would be next in  command. To this he replied: \"Yes, that is what I understand--.\"    And if I am not mistaken, this was the first announcement of the  important fact that Botha was to lead us in future.    Much more was said and much arranged; some of the commandos were to go  to Cape Colony and attempt to check the progress of Lord Roberts, who  was marching steadily north after Cronje's surrender. Finally each  officer had some position assigned to him in the mountain-chain we  call the Biggarsbergen. I was placed under General Meyer at  Vantondersnek, near Pomeroy, and we left at once for our destination.  From this place a pass leads through the Biggarsbergen, about 18 miles  from Glencoe Station.          CHAPTER XIII.    DRIVEN FROM THE BIGGARSBERGEN.      We spent the next few weeks in entrenching and fortifying our new  positions. General Botha had left with some men for the Orange Free  State which Lord Roberts, having relieved Kimberley, was marching  through. General Joubert died about this time at Pretoria, having been  twenty-one years Commandant-General of the South African Republic. He  was without doubt one of the most prominent figures in the South  African drama.    General Botha now took up the chief command and soon proved himself to  be worthy of holding the reins. He enjoyed the confidence and esteem  of our whole army, a very important advantage under our trying  circumstances.    Assisted by De Wet he was soon engaged in organizing the commandos in  the Orange Free State, and in attempting to make some sort of a stand  against the British, who were now marching through the country in  overwhelming numbers. In this Republic the burghers had been under the  command of the aged General Prinsloo, who now, however, had become so  downhearted that the supreme command was taken from him and given to  General De Wet. Prinsloo surrendered soon after, in doing which he did  his people his greatest service; it was, however, unfortunate that he  should have succeeded in leading with him 900 burghers into the hands  of the enemy.    In the Biggarsbergen we had nothing to do but to sleep and eat and  drink. On two separate occasions, however, we were ordered to join  others in attacking the enemy's camp at Elandslaagte. This was done  with much ado, but I would rather say nothing about the way in which  the attacks were directed. It suffices to say that both failed  miserably, and we were forced to retire considerably quicker than we  had come.    Our generals, meantime, were very busy issuing innumerable circulars  to the different commandos. It is impossible for me to remember the  contents of all these curious manifestos, but one read as follows:--         \"A roll-call of all burghers is to be taken daily; weekly       reports are to be sent to headquarters of each separate       commando, and the minimum number of burghers making up a       field-cornetship is therein to be stated. Every 15 men       forming a field-cornetship are to be under a corporal; and       these corporals are to hold a roll-call every day, and to       send in weekly detailed reports of their men to the       Field-Cornet and Commandant, who in his turn must report to       the General.\"    Another lengthy circular had full instructions and regulations for the  granting of \"leave\" to burghers, an intricate arrangement which gave  officers a considerable amount of trouble. The scheme was known as the  \"furlough system,\" and was an effort to introduce a show of  organisation into the weighty matter of granting leave of absence. It  failed, however, completely to have its desired effect. It provided  that one-tenth of each commando should be granted furlough for a  fortnight, and then return to allow another tenth part to go in its  turn. In a case of sick leave, a doctor's certificate was required,  which had to bear the counter-signature of the field-cornet; its  possessor was then allowed to go home instead of to the hospital.  Further, a percentage of the farmers were allowed from time to time to  go home and attend to pressing matters of their farms, such as  harvesting, shearing sheep, etc. Men were chosen by the farmers to go  and attend to matters not only for themselves but for other farmers in  their districts as well. The net result of all this was that when  everybody who could on some pretext or other obtain furlough had done  so, about a third of each commando was missing. My burghers who were  mostly men from the Witwatersrand Goldfields, could of course obtain  no leave for farming purposes; and great dissatisfaction prevailed. I  was inundated with complaints about their unfair treatment in this  respect and only settled matters with considerable trouble.    I agree that this matter had to be regulated somehow, and I do not  blame the authorities for their inability to cope with the  difficulty. It seemed a great pity, however, that the commandos should  be weakened so much and that the fighting spirit should be destroyed  in this fashion. Of course it was our first big war and our  arrangements were naturally of a very primitive character.    It was the beginning of May before our friends the enemy at Ladysmith  and Elandslaagte began to show some signs of activity. We discovered  unmistakable signs that some big forward movement was in progress, but  we could not discover on which point the attack was to be directed.  Buller and his men were marching on the road along Vantondersnek, and  I scented heavy fighting for us again. I gathered a strong patrol and  started out to reconnoitre the position. We found that the enemy had  pitched their camp past Waschbank in great force, and were sending out  detachments in an easterly direction. From this I concluded that they  did not propose going through Vantondersnek, but that they intended to  attack our left flank at Helpmakaar. This seemed to me, at any rate,  to be General Buller's safest plan.    Helpmakaar was east of my position; it is a little village elbowed in  a pass in the Biggarsbergen. By taking this point one could hold the  key to our entire extended line of defence, as was subsequently only  too clearly shown. I pointed this out to some of our generals, but a  commandant's opinion did not weigh much just then; nor was any notice  taken of a similar warning from Commandant Christian Botha, who held a  position close to mine with the Swaziland burghers.    We had repeated skirmishes with the English outposts during our  scouting expeditions, and on one occasion we suddenly encountered a  score of men of the South African Light Horse.    We noticed them in a \"donk\" (a hollow place) thickly covered with  trees and bushes, but not before we were right amongst them. It  appears they mistook us for Englishmen, while we thought at first they  were members of Colonel Blake's Irish Brigade. Many of them shook  hands with us, and a burgher named Vivian Cogell asked them in Dutch:  \"How are you, boys?\"    To which an Englishman, who understood a little Dutch, answered: \"Oh,  all right; where do you come from?\"    Vivian replied: \"From Viljoen's commando; we are scouting.\"    Then the Englishman discovered who we were, but Vivian gave the man no  time for reflection. Riding up to him, he asked: \"What regiment do you  belong to?\"    \"To the South African Light Horse,\" answered the Englishman.    \"Hands up!\" retorted Vivian, and the English-Afrikander threw down his  gun and put up his hands.    \"Hands up! Hands up!\" was the cry now universally heard, and although  a few escaped, the majority were disarmed and made prisoners. It had  been made a rule that when a burgher captured a British soldier he  should be allowed to conduct him to Pretoria, where he could then  obtain a few days' leave to visit his family. This did much to  encourage our burghers to make prisoners, although many lost their  lives in attempting to do so.    The next day, General Buller marched on Helpmakaar, passing close to  our position. We fired a few shots from our Creusot gun, and had  several light skirmishes. The enemy, however, concentrated the fire of  a few batteries on us, and our guns were soon silenced.    General L. Meyer had arrived with some reinforcements close to  Helpmakaar, but the position had never been strengthened, and the sole  defending force consisted of the Piet Retief burghers, known as the  \"Piet Retreaters,\" together with a small German corps. The result was  easy to predict. The attack was made, and we lost the position without  seriously attempting to defend it. Buller was now, therefore, in  possession of the key to the Boer position in Natal, a position which  we had occupied for two months--and could therefore, have fortified to  perfection--and whose strategic importance should have been known in  its smallest details. I think our generals, who had a sufficient force  at their disposal, of which the mobility has become world-famed,  should have been able to prevent such a fiasco as our occupation of  the splendid line of defence in the Biggarsbergen turned out to be.    Here, for the first time in the war, General Buller utilised his  success, and followed up our men as they were retreating on Dundee. He  descended by the main waggon track from Helpmakaar, and drove the  commandos like sheep before him. I myself was obliged to move away in  hot haste and join the general retreat. Once or twice our men  attempted to make a stand, but with little success.    When we reached Dundee the enemy gradually slackened off pursuit, and  at dark we were clear of them.
