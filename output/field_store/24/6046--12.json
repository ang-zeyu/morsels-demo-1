[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27509"],[0,"The 2006 CIA World Factbook (#13)"],[1,"provides the fundamental and  factual reference material on a country or issue. Current  intelligence reports on new developments. Estimative intelligence  judges probable outcomes. The three are mutually supportive: basic  intelligence is the foundation on which the other two are  constructed; current intelligence continually updates the  inventory  of knowledge; and estimative intelligence revises overall  interpretations of country and issue prospects for guidance of basic  and  current intelligence. The World Factbook, The President's Daily  Brief, and the National Intelligence Estimates are examples of the  three types of finished intelligence.    The United States has carried on foreign intelligence  activities since the days of George Washington but only since World  War II have they been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three  programs have highlighted the development of coordinated basic  intelligence since that time: (1) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence  Studies (JANIS), (2) the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3)  The World Factbook.    During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the  production of basic intelligence by different components of the US  Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting  information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought  home to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for  integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed  and coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers  as Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous  interest. In the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines  had to launch amphibious operations against many islands about which  information was unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities  resolved that the United States should never again be caught  unprepared.    In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office  of Naval Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director  of the Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint  effort should be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27  April 1943 that recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence  Study Publishing Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish  the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the  first interdepartmental basic intelligence program to fulfill the  needs of the US Government for an authoritative and coordinated  appraisal of strategic basic intelligence. Between April 1943 and  July 1947, the board published 34 JANIS studies. JANIS performed  well in the war effort, and numerous letters of commendation were  received, including a statement from Adm. Forrest Sherman, Chief of  Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said, \"JANIS has become the  indispensable reference work for the shore-based planners.\"    The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the  postwar world was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a  noted author on national security. He wrote in The Future of  American Secret Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46)  that world leadership in peace requires even more elaborate  intelligence than in war. \"The conduct of peace involves all  countries, all human activities - not just the enemy and his war  production.\"    The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947  and officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1  October 1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed  operational responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the  National Security Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No.  3, which authorized the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program  as a peacetime replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before  adequate NIS country sections could be produced, government agencies  had to develop more comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US  Board on Geographic Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department  of the Interior produced the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.    The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to  study the structure and administration of the CIA, reported to  Congress in 1955 that: \"The National Intelligence Survey is an  invaluable publication which provides the essential elements of  basic intelligence on all areas of the world. There will always be a  continuing requirement for keeping the Survey up-to-date.\" The  Factbook was created as an annual summary and update to the  encyclopedic NIS studies. The first classified Factbook was  published in August 1962, and the first unclassified version was  published in June 1971. The NIS program was terminated in 1973  except for the Factbook, map, and gazetteer components. The 1975  Factbook was the first to be made available to the public with sales  through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The Factbook was  first made available on the Internet in June 1997. The year 2006  marks the 59th anniversary of the establishment of the Central  Intelligence Agency and the 63nd year of continuous basic  intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and  its two predecessor programs.

The pacha's fleet succeeded no better than his army. Issuing from the  Gulf of Ambracia, it was intended to attack Parga from the sea, joining  in the massacre, and cutting off all hope of escape from that side, Ali  meaning to spare neither the garrison nor any male inhabitants over  twelve years of age. But a few shots fired from a small fort dispersed  the ships, and a barque manned by sailors from Paxos pursued them, a  shot from which killed Ali's admiral on his quarter-deck. He was a Greek  of Galaxidi, Athanasius Macrys by name.    Filled with anxiety, Ali awaited news at Prevesa, where a courier, sent  off at the beginning of the action, had brought him oranges gathered in  the orchards of Parga. Ali gave him a purse of gold, and publicly  proclaimed his success. His joy was redoubled when a second messenger  presented two heads of French soldiers, and announced that his troops  were in possession of the lower part of Parga. Without further delay he  ordered his attendants to mount, entered his carriage, and started  triumphantly on the Roman road to Nicopolis. He sent messengers to his  generals, ordering them to spare the women and children of Parga,  intended for his harem, and above all to take strict charge of the  plunder. He was approaching the arena of Nicopolis when a third Tartar  messenger informed him of the defeat of his army. Ali changed  countenance, and could scarcely articulate the order to return to  Prevesa. Once in his palace, he gave way to such fury that all around  him trembled, demanding frequently if it could be true that his troops  were beaten. \"May your misfortune be upon us!\" his attendants answered,  prostrating themselves. All at once, looking out on the calm blue sea  which lay before his windows, he perceived his fleet doubling Cape  Pancrator and re-entering the Ambracian Gulf under full sail; it  anchored close by the palace, and on hailing the leading ship a speaking  trumpet announced to Ali the death of his admiral, Athanasius Macrys.    \"But Parga, Parga!\" cried Ali.    \"May Allah grant the pacha long life! The Parganiotes have escaped the  sword of His Highness.\"    \"It is the will of Allah!\" murmured the pacha; whose head sank upon his  breast in dejection.    Arms having failed, Ali, as usual, took refuge in plots and treachery,  but this time, instead of corrupting his enemies with gold, he sought to  weaken them by division.          CHAPTER VII      The French commander Nicole, surnamed the \"Pilgrim,\" on account of a  journey he had once made to Mecca, had spent six months at Janina with a  brigade of artillery which General Marmont, then commanding in the  Illyrian provinces, had for a time placed at Ali's disposal. The old  officer had acquired the esteem and friendship of the pacha, whose  leisure he had often amused by stories of his campaigns and various  adventures, and although it was now long since they had met, he still  had the reputation of being Ali's friend. Ali prepared his plans  accordingly. He wrote a letter to Colonel Nicole, apparently in  continuation of a regular correspondence between them, in which he  thanked the colonel for his continued affection, and besought him by  various powerful motives to surrender Parga, of which he promised him  the governorship during the rest of his life. He took good care to  complete his treason by allowing the letter to fall into the hands of  the chief ecclesiastics of Parga, who fell head-foremost into the trap.  Seeing that the tone of the letter was in perfect accordance with the  former friendly relations between their French governor and the pacha,  they were convinced of the former's treachery. But the result was not as  Ali had hoped: the Parganiotes resumed their former negotiations with  the English, preferring to place their freedom in the hands of a  Christian nation rather than to fall under the rule of a Mohammedan  satrap.... The English immediately sent a messenger to Colonel Nicole,  offering honourable conditions of capitulation. The colonel returned a  decided refusal, and threatened to blow up the place if the inhabitants,  whose intentions he guessed, made the slightest hostile movement.  However, a few days later, the citadel was taken at night, owing to the  treachery of a woman who admitted an English detachment; and the next  day, to the general astonishment, the British standard floated over the  Acropolis of Parga.    All Greece was then profoundly stirred by a faint gleam of the dawn of  liberty, and shaken by a suppressed agitation. The Bourbons again  reigned in France, and the Greeks built a thousand hopes on an event  which changed the basis of the whole European policy. Above all, they  reckoned on powerful assistance from Russia. But England had already  begun to dread anything which could increase either the possessions or  the influence of this formidable power. Above all, she was determined  that the Ottoman Empire should remain intact, and that the Greek navy,  beginning to be formidable, must be destroyed. With these objects in  view, negotiations with Ali Pacha were resumed. The latter was still  smarting under his recent disappointment, and to all overtures answered  only, \"Parga! I must have Parga.\"--And the English were compelled to  yield it!    Trusting to the word of General Campbell, who had formally promised, on  its surrender, that Parga should be classed along with the seven Ionian  Isles; its grateful inhabitants were enjoying a delicious rest after the  storm, when a letter from the Lord High Commissioner, addressed to  Lieutenant-Colonel de Bosset, undeceived them, and gave warning of the  evils which were to burst on the unhappy town.    On the 25th of March, 1817, notwithstanding the solemn promise made to  the Parganiotes, when they admitted the British troops, that they should  always be on the same footing as the Ionian Isles, a treaty was signed  at Constantinople by the British Plenipotentiary, which stipulated the  complete and stipulated cession of Parga and all its territory to, the  Ottoman Empire. Soon there arrived at Janine Sir John Cartwright, the  English Consul at Patras, to arrange for the sale of the lands of the  Parganiotes and discuss the conditions of their emigration. Never before  had any such compact disgraced European diplomacy, accustomed hitherto  to regard Turkish encroachments as simple sacrilege. But Ali Pacha  fascinated the English agents, overwhelming them with favours, honours,  and feasts, carefully watching them all the while. Their correspondence  was intercepted, and he endeavoured by means of his agents to rouse the  Parganiotes against them. The latter lamented bitterly, and appealed to  Christian Europe, which remained deaf to their cries. In the name of  their ancestors, they demanded the rights which had been guaranteed  them. \"They will buy our lands,\" they said; \"have we asked to sell them?  And even if we received their value, can gold give us a country and the  tombs of our ancestors?\"    Ali Pacha invited the Lord High Commissioner of Great Britain, Sir  Thomas Maitland, to a conference at Prevesa, and complained of the  exorbitant price of 1,500,000, at which the commissioners had estimated  Parga and its territory, including private property and church  furniture. It had been hoped that Ali's avarice would hesitate at this  high price, but he was not so easily discouraged. He give a banquet for  the Lord High Commissioner, which degenerated into a shameless orgy. In  the midst of this drunken hilarity the Turk and the Englishman disposed  of the territory of Parga; agreeing that a fresh estimate should be made  on the spot by experts chosen by both English and Turks. The result of  this valuation was that the indemnity granted to the Christians was  reduced by the English to the sum of 276,075 sterling, instead of the  original 500,000. And as Ali's agents only arrived at the sum of 56,750,  a final conference was held at Buthrotum between Ali and the Lord High  Commissioner. The latter then informed the Parganiotes that the  indemnity allowed them was irrevocably fixed at 150,000! The transaction  is a disgrace to the egotistical and venal nation which thus allowed the  life and liberty of a people to be trifled with, a lasting blot on the  honour of England!    The Parganiotes at first could believe neither in the infamy of their  protectors nor in their own misfortune; but both were soon confirmed by  a proclamation of the Lord High Commissioner, informing them that the  pacha's army was marching to take possession of the territory which, by  May 10th, must be abandoned for ever.    The fields were then in full bearing. In the midst of plains ripening  for a rich harvest were 80,000 square feet of olive trees, alone  estimated at two hundred thousand guineas. The sun shone in cloudless  azure, the air was balmy with the scent of orange trees, of pomegranates  and citrons. But the lovely country might have been inhabited by  phantoms; only hands raised to heaven and brows bent to the dust met  one's eye. Even the very dust belonged no more to the wretched  inhabitants; they were forbidden to take a fruit or a flower, the  priests might not remove either relics or sacred images. Church,  ornaments, torches, tapers, pyxes, had by this treaty all become  Mahommedan property. The English had sold everything, even to the Host!  Two days more, and all must be left. Each was silently marking the door  of the dwelling destined so soon to shelter an enemy, with a red cross,  when suddenly a terrible cry echoed from street to street, for the Turks  had been perceived on the heights overlooking the town. Terrified and  despairing, the whole population hastened to fall prostrate before the  Virgin of Parga, the ancient guardian of their citadel. A mysterious  voice, proceeding from the"]]]
