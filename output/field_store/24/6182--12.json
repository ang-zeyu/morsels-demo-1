So they put in mostly women and children and the boat pushed out into  the darkness so freighted down it would hardly float.    In the bow of it was the Presbyterian student who was relieving the  minister, and he called out that they were in the hands of Providence.  But he was crouched and ready to spring out of them at the first moment.    So the boat went and was lost in the darkness except for the lantern in  the bow that you could see bobbing on the water. Then presently it came  back and they sent another load, till pretty soon the decks began to  thin out and everybody got impatient to be gone.    It was about the time that the third boat-load put off that Mr. Smith  took a bet with Mullins for twenty-five dollars, that he'd be home in  Mariposa before the people in the boats had walked round the shore.    No one knew just what he meant, but pretty soon they saw Mr. Smith  disappear down below into the lowest part of the steamer with a mallet  in one hand and a big bundle of marline in the other.    They might have wondered more about it, but it was just at this time  that they heard the shouts from the rescue boat--the big Mackinaw  lifeboat--that had put out from the town with fourteen men at the sweeps  when they saw the first rockets go up.    I suppose there is always something inspiring about a rescue at sea, or  on the water.    After all, the bravery of the lifeboat man is the true  bravery,--expended to save life, not to destroy it.    Certainly they told for months after of how the rescue boat came out to  the Mariposa Belle.    I suppose that when they put her in the water the lifeboat touched it  for the first time since the old Macdonald Government placed her on Lake  Wissanotti.    Anyway, the water poured in at every seam. But not for a moment,--even  with two miles of water between them and the steamer,--did the rowers  pause for that.    By the time they were half-way there the water was almost up to the  thwarts, but they drove her on. Panting and exhausted (for mind you, if  you haven't been in a fool boat like that for years, rowing takes it out  of you), the rowers stuck to their task. They threw the ballast over  and chucked into the water the heavy cork jackets and lifebelts that  encumbered their movements. There was no thought of turning back. They  were nearer to the steamer than the shore.    \"Hang to it, boys,\" called the crowd from the steamer's deck, and hang  they did.    They were almost exhausted when they got them; men leaning from the  steamer threw them ropes and one by one every man was hauled aboard just  as the lifeboat sank under their feet.    Saved! by Heaven, saved, by one of the smartest pieces of rescue work  ever seen on the lake.    There's no use describing it; you need to see rescue work of this kind  by lifeboats to understand it.    Nor were the lifeboat crew the only ones that distinguished themselves.    Boat after boat and canoe after canoe had put out from Mariposa to the  help of the steamer. They got them all.    Pupkin, the other bank teller, with a face like a horse, who hadn't gone  on the excursion,--as soon as he knew that the boat was signalling for  help and that Miss Lawson was sending up rockets,--rushed for a row  boat, grabbed an oar (two would have hampered him), and paddled madly  out into the lake. He struck right out into the dark with the crazy  skiff almost sinking beneath his feet. But they got him. They rescued  him. They watched him, almost dead with exhaustion, make his way to the  steamer, where he was hauled up with ropes. Saved! Saved!!      They might have gone on that way half the night, picking up the  rescuers, only, at the very moment when the tenth load of people left  for the shore,--just as suddenly and saucily as you please, up came the  Mariposa Belle from the mud bottom and floated.    FLOATED?    Why, of course she did. If you take a hundred and fifty people off a  steamer that has sunk, and if you get a man as shrewd as Mr. Smith  to plug the timber seams with mallet and marline, and if you turn ten  bandsmen of the Mariposa band on to your hand pump on the bow of the  lower decks--float? why, what else can she do?    Then, if you stuff in hemlock into the embers of the fire that you were  raking out, till it hums and crackles under the boiler, it won't be  long before you hear the propeller thud thudding at the stern again, and  before the long roar of the steam whistle echoes over to the town.    And so the Mariposa Belle, with all steam up again and with the long  train of sparks careering from the funnel, is heading for the town.    But no Christie Johnson at the wheel in the pilot house this time.    \"Smith! Get Smith!\" is the cry.    Can he take her in? Well, now! Ask a man who has had steamers sink on  him in half the lakes from Temiscaming to the Bay, if he can take her  in? Ask a man who has run a York boat down the rapids of the Moose when  the ice is moving, if he can grip the steering wheel of the Mariposa  Belle? So there she steams safe and sound to the town wharf!    Look at the lights and the crowd! If only the federal census taker could  count us now! Hear them calling and shouting back and forward from the  deck to the shore! Listen! There is the rattle of the shore ropes as  they get them ready, and there's the Mariposa band,--actually forming  in a circle on the upper deck just as she docks, and the leader with his  baton,--one--two--ready now,--    \"O CAN-A-DA!\"          FOUR. The Ministrations of the Rev. Mr. Drone    The Church of England in Mariposa is on a side street, where the maple  trees are thickest, a little up the hill from the heart of the town. The  trees above the church and the grass plot that was once the cemetery,  till they made the new one (the Necropolis, over the brow of the hill),  fill out the whole corner. Down behind the church, with only the driving  shed and a lane between, is the rectory. It is a little brick house with  odd angles. There is a hedge and a little gate, and a weeping ash tree  with red berries.    At the side of the rectory, churchward, is a little grass lawn with low  hedges and at the side of that two wild plum trees, that are practically  always in white blossom. Underneath them is a rustic table and chairs,  and it is here that you may see Rural Dean Drone, the incumbent of the  Church of England Church, sitting, in the chequered light of the plum  tress that is neither sun nor shadow. Generally you will find him  reading, and when I tell you that at the end of the grass plot where the  hedge is highest there is a yellow bee hive with seven bees that belong  to Dean Drone, you will realize that it is only fitting that the Dean is  reading in the Greek. For what better could a man be reading beneath the  blossom of the plum trees, within the very sound of the bees, than the  Pastorals of Theocritus? The light trash of modern romance might put  a man to sleep in such a spot, but with such food for reflection as  Theocritus, a man may safely close his eyes and muse on what he reads  without fear of dropping into slumber.    Some men, I suppose, terminate their education when they leave their  college. Not so Dean Drone. I have often heard him say that if he  couldn't take a book in the Greek out on the lawn in a spare half hour,  he would feel lost. It's a certain activity of the brain that must be  stilled somehow. The Dean, too, seemed to have a native feeling for the  Greek language. I have often heard people who might sit with him on  the lawn, ask him to translate some of it. But he always refused. One  couldn't translate it, he said. It lost so much in the translation that  it was better not to try. It was far wiser not to attempt it. If you  undertook to translate it, there was something gone, something missing  immediately. I believe that many classical scholars feel this way, and  like to read the Greek just as it is, without the hazard of trying to  put it into so poor a medium as English. So that when Dean Drone  said that he simply couldn't translate it, I believe he was perfectly  sincere.    Sometimes, indeed, he would read it aloud. That was another matter.  Whenever, for example, Dr. Gallagher--I mean, of course, old Dr.  Gallagher, not the young doctor (who was always out in the country in  the afternoon)--would come over and bring his latest Indian relics to  show to the Dean, the latter always read to him a passage or two. As  soon as the doctor laid his tomahawk on the table, the Dean would  reach for his Theocritus. I remember that on the day when Dr. Gallagher  brought over the Indian skull that they had dug out of the railway  embankment, and placed it on the rustic table, the Dean read to him so  long from Theocritus that the doctor, I truly believe, dozed off in his  chair. The Dean had to wait and fold his hands with the book across his  knee, and close his eyes till the doctor should wake up again. And the  skull was on the table between them, and from above the plum blossoms  fluttered down, till they made flakes on it as white as Dr. Gallagher's  hair.    I don't want you to suppose that the Rev. Mr. Drone spent the whole of  his time under the trees. Not at all. In point of fact, the rector's  life was one round of activity which lie himself might deplore but was  powerless to prevent. He had hardly sat down beneath the trees of an  afternoon after his mid-day meal when there was the Infant Class at  three, and after that, with scarcely an hour between, the Mothers'  Auxiliary at five, and the next morning the Book Club, and that evening  the Bible Study Class, and the next morning the Early Workers' Guild at  eleven-thirty. The whole week was like that,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35333"],[0,"Life of Heber C. Kimball, an Apostle (#13)"],[1,"Brother Luke Johnson was digging, the cholera attacked him with  cramping and blindness. Brother Brigham laid hold of him and pulled  him out of the grave, and shook him about, talked to and prayed for  him, and exhorted him to jump about and exercise himself, when it  would leave him for a few moments, then it would attack him again; and  thus we had the greatest difficulty to keep the destroyer from laying  us low. Soon after we returned another brother was taken from our  little band; thus it continued until five out of ten were taken away.    \"After burying these five brethren I was seized by the hand of the  destroyer, as I went in the woods to pray. I was instantly struck  blind, and saw no way whereby I could free myself from the disease,  only by jumping and thrashing myself about, until my sight returned to  me and my blood began to circulate in my veins. I started and ran some  distance, and by this means, through the help of God, I was enabled to  extricate myself from the grasp of death. This circumstance took place  in a piece of woods behind Brother Gilbert's house.    \"On the 26th Algernon Sidney Gilbert, keeper of the Lord's storehouse,  signed a letter to the governor, in connection with others, which was  his last public act, for he had been called to preach and he said he  would rather die than go forth and preach the Gospel to the wicked  Gentile nations. The Lord took him at his word; he was attacked with  the cholera and died about the 29th.    \"Brothers Erastus Budd and Jesse Johnson Smith, a cousin of the  Prophet, died at Brother Gilbert's about the same time.    \"While we were here, the brethren being in want of some refreshment,  Brother Luke Johnson went to Brother Burgett to get a fowl, asking him  for one to make a broth for Elder Wilcox and others; but Brother  Burgett denied him it, saying, 'In a few days we expect to return back  into Jackson County, and I shall want them when I get there.' When  Brother Johnson returned he was so angry at Burgett for refusing him,  he said, 'I have a great mind to take my rifle and go back and shoot  his horse.' I told Luke to never mind; that such actions never fail to  bring their reward.    \"Judge how we felt, after having left the society of our beloved  families, taking our lives in our hands and traveling about one  thousand miles through scenes of suffering and sorrow, for the benefit  of our brethren, and after all to be denied of a small fowl to make a  little soup for brethren in the agonies of death. Such things never  fail to bring their reward, and it would be well for the Saints never  to turn away a brother who is penniless and in want, or a stranger,  lest they may one day or other want a friend themselves.    \"I went to Liberty, to the house of Brother Peter Whitmer, which place  I reached with difficulty, being much afflicted with the disease that  was among us. I stayed there until my return home, receiving great  kindness at the hands of the brethren.    \"The destroyer having afflicted us four days, ceased. Sixty-eight were  attacked by the disease, of which number fourteen members of Zion's  Camp died.    \"June 30th I started for home in company with Lyman Sherman, Sylvester  Smith, Alexander Badlam, Harrison Burgess, Luke Johnson and Zera Cole.  They elected me their captain.    \"We proceeded on our journey daily, the Lord blessing us with strength  and health. The weather was very hot, but we traveled from thirty-five  to forty miles a day, until about the 26th of July, when we arrived in  Kirtland; having been gone from home about three months, during which  time, with the exception of four nights, I slept on the ground.    \"On my arrival home I found my family well, and I felt to rejoice in  the Lord that He had preserved my life through so many dangers.  Concluding that I had finished my mission to which the Lord had called  me, after resting a few days, I established my pottery and began  business.\"    Thus ended that remarkable expedition; remarkable for its object, for  the issues involved, for its tragic episodes, examples of heroism and  miraculous manifestations of divine power. What had it achieved? some  may ask. Nay, might not many be tempted to query, Was not the mission  of Zion's Camp a failure?    \"What have you accomplished?\" was the sneering taunt of the apostate  and of those weak in faith, met by the remnant of the little band on  their return to Kirtland. \"Just what we went for;\" the meek, though  firm reply of such men as Heber C. Kimball and Brigham Young.    And they were right. To them it was no failure. The trial of their  faith was complete. Their offering, like Abraham's, had been accepted.  They had been weighed in the eternal balance, and were not found  wanting.    But what of Zion and her redemption?    Let the word of the Lord, the God of Enoch, the God of Joseph give  answer:    \"THE REDEMPTION OF ZION MUST NEEDS COME BY POWER.\"    Power dwells in unity, not in discord; in humility, not pride; in  sacrifice, not selfishness; obedience, not rebellion.    Zion's Camp, if it failed at all in fulfilling its mission, failed for  precisely similar reasons to those which had caused the expulsion of  the Saints from Jackson County; reasons which, in ancient times, kept  Israel wandering for forty years in the wilderness, within sight of  their coveted Canaan, which they were not permitted in that generation  to possess. Like Moses, these modern pilgrims beheld, as from Pisgah's  top, their promised land: like Moses, on account of transgression,  they were not permitted to \"cross over.\" No doubt there were Calebs  and Joshuas in the Camp, who were worthy. But the great event, in the  wisdom of the Highest, was not then destined to be.    It was left for a future generation and its Joshua to go up in the  might of the Lord and redeem Zion.    Yet not alone upon Zion's Camp must rest the responsibility of their  failure to redeem Zion. It bears with at least equal weight upon those  whom they came to succor.    What said the Lord concerning them?        \"Behold, they have not learned to be obedient, * * * but are full      of all manner of evil, and do not impart of their substance, as      becometh Saints, to the poor and afflicted among them.\"    Is not the episode of the fowl, related by Heber, a tell-tale straw  before the wind in this connection? Can a people honey-combed with  selfishness build up Zion?        \"And are not united according to the union required by the law of      the celestial kingdom;\"--    Again that injunction of unity, the secret of Zion's redemption.  \"Except ye are one ye are not mine.\"        \"And Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the      law of the celestial kingdom, otherwise I cannot receive her unto      myself.\"    Wonderful revealing, this. What is it but to say that the United  Order, the Order of Enoch, the Order of Zion, is the order of the  celestial worlds, where the Gods, a divine brotherhood, have \"all  things common?\"        \"Therefore it is expedient in me that mine elders should wait for      a little season, for the redemption of Zion.\"    Is it marvelous that this should be; that a work of such magnitude  should require preparation; that Zion, city of holiness, should be  built up only by the pure in heart? Ah, reader, the redemption of Zion  is more than the purchase or recovery of lands, the building of  cities, or even the founding of nations. It is the conquest of the  heart, the subjugation of the soul, the sanctifying of the flesh, the  purifying and ennobling of the passions. Greater is he who subdues  himself, who captures and maintains the citadel of his own soul, than  he who, misnamed conqueror, fills the world with the roar of drums,  the thunder of cannon, the lightning of swords and bayonets, overturns  and sets up kingdoms, lives and reigns a king, yet wears to the grave  the fetters of unbridled lust, and dies the slave of sin.    In her children's hearts must Zion first be built up and redeemed;  \"every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things  with an eye single to the glory of God.\" When the fig-tree of Israel's  faith puts forth such leaves, then know that the summer is nigh.        \"And this cannot be brought to pass, until mine elders are endowed      with power from on high.\"    And yet were these same elders, unendowed, sent forth to redeem Zion?  Surely the Lord did not design it then to be. Else, would he not have  endowed them before-hand? This admitted, and what becomes of their  \"failure?\"    Ah, there are many such failures in a sublime success. They are but  steps in the stairway of triumph and victory.    What did Zion's Camp achieve? It cast the shadow of a coming event;  struck the spark that shall kindle to a flame; fixed on the horizon of  history a shining star, the herald of a glory yet to come.          CHAPTER X.    BUILDING THE TEMPLE--JOSEPH AND HEBER WORKING IN THE QUARRY--THE  THEOLOGICAL SCHOOL--A LESSON ON FAITH--CALL OF THE TWELVE--HEBER C.  KIMBALL ORDAINED AN APOSTLE.      The work now engaging, almost exclusively, the attention of the Church  in Kirtland, was the building of the Temple. This edifice was begun in  June, 1833. The walls were partly reared when, in the year following,  the expedition for the relief of the Missouri Saints took from  Kirtland nearly all the able-bodied men whose means and energies,  otherwise, would have been employed upon the Lord's House.    But the sacred enterprise was not suffered to languish. The elders  left in charge were untiring in their efforts to promote the work. The  brethren labored day and night, and the sisters--among the foremost,  as ever, in a good cause--were not one whit behind. Says Heber:    \"Our women were engaged in knitting and spinning, in order to clothe  those who were laboring at the building; and the Lord only knows the  scenes of poverty, tribulation and distress which we passed through to  "]]]
