[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31103"],[0,"A Christmas Greeting: A Series of Stories (#13)"],[1,"the goddess of victory, also of metal, held the reins. It was  _Thorwaldsen's Museum._    \"How it shines! How it shines!'' said the old maiden sparrow. That,  doubtless, is 'the beautiful.' Chirrup! But here it is larger than a  peacock!\" She remembered still what her mother, when she was a child,  had looked upon as the grandest among all beautiful things. The  sparrow fled down into the court: all was so magnificent. Palms and  foliage were painted on the walls. In the middle of the court stood a  large, blooming rose-tree; it spread out its fresh branches, with its  many roses, over a grave. Thither flew the old maiden sparrow, for she  saw there many of her sort. \"Chirrup!\" and three scrapes with the left  leg. Thus had she often saluted, from one year's end to the other, and  nobody had answered the greeting--for those who are once separated do  not meet again every day--till at last the salutation had grown into a  habit. But to-day, however, two old sparrows and one young one  answered with a \"Chirrup!\" and with a thrice-repeated scrape of the  left leg.    \"Ah, good day, good day!\" It was two old birds from the nest, and a  little one besides, of the family. \"That we should meet here! It is a  very grand sort of place, but there is nothing to eat here: that is  'the beautiful!' Chirrup!\"    And many persons advanced from the side apartments, where the  magnificent marble figures stood, and approached the grave that hid  the great master who had formed the marble figures. All stood with,  glorified countenances around Thorwaldsen's grave, and some picked up  the shed rose-leaves and carefully guarded them. They had come from  far--one from mighty England, others from Germany and France: the most  lovely lady gathered one of the roses and hid it in her bosom. Then  the sparrows thought that the roses governed here, and that the whole  house had been built on account of them. Now, this seemed to them, at  all events, too much; however, as it was for the roses that the  persons showed all their love, they would remain no longer. \"Chirrup!\"  said they, and swept the floor with their tails, and winked with one  eye at the roses. They had not looked at them long before they  convinced themselves that they were their old neighbors. And they  really were so. The painter who had drawn the rose-bush beside the  burned-down house, had afterwards obtained permission to dig it up,  and had given it to the architect--for more beautiful roses had never  been seen--and the architect had planted it on Thorwaldsen's grave,  where it bloomed as a symbol of the beautiful, and gave up its red  fragrant leaves to be carried to distant lands as a remembrance.    \"Have you got an appointment here in town?\" asked the sparrows.    And the roses nodded: they recognised their brown neighbors, and  rejoiced to see them again. \"How delightful it is to live and to  bloom, to see old friends again, and every day to look on happy faces!  It is as if every day were a holy-day.\"    \"Chirrup!\" said the sparrows. \"Yes, it is in truth our old neighbors;  their origin--from the pond--is still quite clear in our memory!  Chirrup! How they have risen in the world! Yes, Fortune favors some  while they sleep! Ah! there is a withered leaf that I see quite  plainly.\" And they pecked at it so long till the leaf fell off; and  the tree stood there greener and more fresh, the roses gave forth  their fragrance in the sunshine over Thorwaldsen's grave, with whose  immortal name, they were united.      ------------        THE DARNING-NEEDLE.    There was once upon a time a darning needle, that imagined itself so  fine, that at last it fancied it was a sewing-needle.    \"Now, pay attention, and hold me firmly!\" said the darning-needle to  the fingers that were taking it out. \"Do not let me fall! If I fall on  the ground, I shall certainly never be found again, so fine am I.\"    \"Pretty well as to that,\" answered the fingers; and so saying, they  took hold of it by the body.    \"Look, I come with a train!\" said the darning-needle, drawing a long  thread after it, but there was no knot to the thread.    The fingers directed the needle against an old pair of shoes belonging  to the cook. The upper-leather was torn, and it was now to be sewed  together.    \"That is vulgar work,\" said the needle; \"I can never get through it. I  shall break! I shall break!\" And it really did break. \"Did I not say  so?\" said the needle; \"I am too delicate.\"    \"Now it's good for nothing,\" said the fingers, but they were obliged  to hold it still; the cook dropped sealing-wax upon it, and pinned her  neckerchief together with it.    \"Well, now I am a breast-pin,\" said the darning-needle. \"I was sure I  should be raised to honor: if one is something, one is sure to get  on!\" and at the same time it laughed inwardly; for one can never see  when a darning-needle laughs. So there it sat now as proudly as in a  state-carriage, and looked around on every side.    \"May I take the liberty to inquire if you are of gold?\" asked the  needle of a pin that was its neighbor. \"You have a splendid exterior,  and a head of your own, but it is small, however. You must do what you  can to grow, for it is not every one that is bedropped with  sealing-wax!\" And then the darning-needle drew itself up so high that  it fell out of the kerchief, and tumbled right into the sink, which  the cook was at that moment rinsing out.    \"Now we are going on our travels,\" said the needle. \"If only I do not  get lost!\" But it really did get lost.    \"I am too delicate for this world!\" said the needle, as it lay in the  sink, \"but I know who I am, and that is always a consolation;\" and the  darning-needle maintained its proud demeanor, and lost none of its  good-humor.    And all sorts of things swam over it--shavings, straws, and scraps of  old newspapers.    \"Only look how they sail by,\" said the needle. \"They do not know what  is hidden below them! I stick fast here: here I sit. Look! there goes  a shaving: it thinks of nothing in the world but of itself--but of a  shaving! There drifts a straw; and how it tacks about, how it turns  round! Think of something else besides yourself, or else perhaps  you'll run against a stone! There swims a bit of a newspaper. What's  written there is long ago forgotten, and yet out it spreads itself, as  if it were mighty important! I sit here patient and still: I know who  I am, and that I shall remain after all!\"    One day there lay something close beside the needle. It glittered so  splendidly, that the needle thought it must be a diamond: but it was  only a bit of a broken bottle, and because it glittered the  darning-needle addressed it, and introduced itself to the other as a  breast-pin.    \"You are, no doubt, a diamond?\"    \"Yes, something of that sort.\" And so each thought the other something  very precious, and they talked together of the world, and of how  haughty it is.    \"I was with a certain miss, in a little box,\" said the darning-needle,  \"and this miss was cook; and on each hand she had five fingers. In my  whole life I have never seen anything so conceited as these fingers!  And yet they were only there to take me out of the box and to put me  back into it again!\"    \"Were they, then, of noble birth?\" asked the broken bottle.    \"Noble!\" said the darning-needle; \"no, but high-minded! There were  five brothers, all descendants of the 'Finger' family. They always  kept together, although they were of different lengths. The outermost  one, little Thumb, was short and stout; he went at the side, a little  in front of the ranks: he had, too, but one joint in his back, so that  he could only make one bow; but he said, if a man were to cut him off,  such a one were no longer fit for military service. Sweet-tooth, the  second finger, pryed into what was sweet, as well as into what was  sour, pointed to the sun and moon, and he it was that gave stress when  they wrote. Longman, the third brother, looked at the others  contemptuously over his shoulder. Goldrim, the fourth, wore a golden  girdle round his body! and the little Peter Playallday did nothing at  all, of which he was very proud. 'Twas boasting, and boasting, and  nothing but boasting, and so away I went.\"    \"And now we sit here and glitter,\" said the broken glass bottle.    At the same moment more water came along the gutter; it streamed over  the sides and carried the bit of bottle away with it.    \"Well, that's an advancement,\" said the darning-needle. \"I remain  where I am: I am too fine; but that is just my pride, and as such is  to be respected.\" And there it sat so proudly, and had many grand  thoughts.    \"I should almost think that I was born of a sunbeam, so fine am I! It  seems to me, too, as if the sunbeams were always seeking me beneath  the surface of the water. Ah! I am so fine, that my mother is unable  to find me! Had I my old eye that broke, I verily think I could weep;  but I would not--weep! no, it's not genteel to weep!\"    One day two boys came rummaging about in the sink, where they found  old nails, farthings, and such sort of things. It was dirty work;  however, they took pleasure in it.    \"Oh!\" cried one who had pricked himself with the needle, \"there's a  fellow for you.\"    \"I am no fellow, I am a lady!\" said the darning-needle; but no one  heard it. The sealing-wax had worn off, and it had become quite black;  but black makes one look more slender, and the needle fancied it  looked more delicate than ever.    \"Here comes an egg-shell sailing along!\" said the boys; and then they  stuck the needle upright in the egg-shell.    \"The walls white and myself black,\" said the needle. \"That is  becoming! People can see me now! If only I do not get seasick, for  then I shall snap.\"    But it was not sea-sick, and did not snap.    \"It is good for sea-sickness to have a stomach of steel, and not to  forget that one is something more than a human being! Now my  sea-sickness is over. The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31111"],[0,"Across Asia on a Bicycle (#13)"],[1,"dinner on the eve of  our departure, went far toward proving their sincerity.    On the morning of July 8, in company with a body-guard of zaptiehs, which  the mutessarif forced upon us, we wheeled down from the ruined  embattlements of Bayazid. The assembled rabble raised a lusty cheer at  parting. An hour later we had surmounted the Kazlee Gool, and the \"land of  Iran\" was before us. At our feet lay the Turco-Persian battle-plains of  Chaldiran, spreading like a desert expanse to the parched barren hills  beyond, and dotted here and there with clumps of trees in the village  oases. And this, then, was the land where, as the poets say, \"the  nightingale sings, and the rose-tree blossoms,\" and where \"a flower is  crushed at every step!\" More truth, we thought, in the Scotch traveler's  description, which divides Persia into two portions--\"One desert with salt,  and the other desert without salt.\" In time we came to McGregor's opinion  as expressed in his description of Khorassan. \"We should fancy,\" said he,  \"a small green circle round every village indicated on the map, and shade  all the rest in brown.\" The mighty hosts whose onward sweep from the Indus  westward was checked only by the Grecian phalanx upon the field of  Marathon must have come from the scattered ruins around, which reminded us  that \"Iran was; she is no more.\" Those myriad ranks of Yenghiz Khan and  Tamerlane brought death and desolation from Turan to Iran, which so often  met to act and react upon one another that both are now only landmarks in  the sea of oblivion.      [Illustration: HARVEST SCENE NEAR KHOI.]    Our honorary escort accompanied us several miles over the border to the  Persian village of Killissakend, and there committed us to the hospitality  of the district khan, with whom we managed to converse in the Turkish  language, which, strange to say, we found available in all the countries  that lay in our transcontinental pathway as far as the great wall of  China. Toward evening we rode in the garden of the harem of the khan, and  at daybreak the next morning were again in the saddle. By a very early  start we hoped to escape the burden of excessive hospitality; in other  words, to get rid of an escort that was an expensive nuisance. At the next  village we were confronted by what appeared to be a shouting,  gesticulating maniac. On dismounting, we learned that a harbinger had been  sent by the khan, the evening before, to have a guard ready to join us as  we passed through. In fact, two armed _ferashes_ were galloping toward us,  armed, as we afterward learned, with American rifles, and the usual  _kamma_, or huge dagger, swinging from a belt of cartridges. These  fellows, like the zaptiehs, were fond of ostentation. They frequently led  us a roundabout way to show us off to their relatives or friends in a  neighboring village. Nature at last came to our deliverance. As we stood  on a prominent ridge taking a last look at Mount Ararat, now more than  fifty miles away, a storm came upon us, showering hailstones as large as  walnuts. The ferashes with frantic steeds dashed ahead to seek a place of  shelter, and we saw them no more.    Five days in Persia brought us to the shores of Lake Ooroomeeyah, the  saltest body of water in the world. Early the next morning we were wading  the chilly waters of the Hadji Chai, and a few hours later found us in the  English consulate at Tabreez, where we were received by the Persian  secretary. The English government, it seemed, had become embroiled in a  local love-affair just at a time when Colonel Stewart was off on  \"diplomatic duty\" on the Russian Transcaspian border. An exceptionally  bright Armenian beauty, a graduate of the American missionary schools at  this place, had been abducted, it was claimed, by a young Kurdish  cavalier, and carried away to his mountain home. Her father, who happened  to be a naturalized English subject, had applied for the assistance of his  adopted country in obtaining her release. Negotiations were at once set on  foot between London and Teheran, which finally led to a formal demand upon  the Kurds by the Shah himself. Upon their repeated refusal, seven thousand  Persian troops, it was said, were ordered to Soak Boulak, under the  command of the vice-consul, Mr. Patton. The matter at length assumed such  an importance as to give rise, in the House of Commons, to the question,  \"Who is Katty Greenfield?\" This, in time, was answered by that lady  herself, who declared under oath that she had become a Mohammedan, and was  in love with the man with whom she had eloped. More than this, it was  learned that she had not a drop of English blood in her veins, her father  being an Austrian, and her mother a native Armenian. Whereupon the Persian  troopers, with their much disgusted leader, beat an inglorious retreat,  leaving \"Katty Greenfield\" mistress of the situation, and of a Kurdish  heart.      [Illustration: LEAVING KHOI.]    In Tabreez there is one object sure to attract attention. This is the  \"Ark,\" or ancient fortified castle of the Persian rulers. High on one of  the sides, which a recent earthquake has rent from top to bottom, there is  a little porch whence these Persian \"Bluebeards,\" or rather Redbeards,  were wont to hurl unruly members of the harem. Under the shadow of these  gloomy walls was enacted a tragedy of this century. Babism is by no means  the only heresy that has sprung from the speculative genius of Persia; but  it is the one that has most deeply moved the society of the present age,  and the one which still obtains, though in secret and without a leader.  Its founder, Seyd Mohammed Ali, better known as Bab, or \"Gate,\"  promulgated the doctrine of anarchy to the extent of \"sparing the rod and  spoiling the child,\" and still worse, perhaps, of refusing to the ladies  no finery that might be at all becoming to their person. While not a  communist, as he has sometimes been wrongly classed, he exhorted the  wealthy to regard themselves as only trustees of the poor. With no thought  at first of acquiring civil power, he and his rapidly increasing following  were driven to revolt by the persecuting mollas, and the sanguinary  struggle of 1848 followed. Bab himself was captured, and carried to this  \"most fanatical city of Persia,\" the burial-place of the sons of Ali. On  this very spot a company was ordered to despatch him with a volley; but  when the smoke cleared away, Bab was not to be seen. None of the bullets  had gone to the mark, and the bird had flown--but not to the safest refuge.  Had he finally escaped, the miracle thus performed would have made Babism  invincible. But he was recaptured and despatched, and his body thrown to  the canine scavengers.      [Illustration: YARD OF CARAVANSARY AT TABREEZ.]      [Illustration: LUMBER-YARD AT TABREEZ.]    _Tabreez_ (fever-dispelling) was a misnomer in our case. Our sojourn here  was prolonged for more than a month by a slight attack of typhoid fever,  which this time seized Sachtleben, and again the kind nursing of the  missionary ladies hastened recovery. Our mail, in the mean time, having  been ordered to Teheran, we were granted the privilege of intercepting it.  For this purpose we were permitted to overhaul the various piles of  letters strewn over the dirty floor of the distributing-office. Both the  Turkish and Persian mail is carried in saddle-bags on the backs of  reinless horses driven at a rapid gallop before the mounted mail-carrier  or herdsman. Owing to the carelessness of the postal officials, legations  and consulates employ special couriers.    The proximity of Tabreez to the Russian border makes it politically, as  well as commercially, one of the most important cities in Persia. For this  reason it is the place of residence of the Emir-e-Nizam (leader of the  army), or prime minister, as well as the Vali-Ahd, or Prince Imperial.  This prince is the Russian candidate, as opposed to the English candidate,  for the prospective vacancy on the throne. Both of these dignitaries  invited us to visit them, and showed much interest in our \"wonderful wind  horses,\" of the speed of which exaggerated reports had circulated through  the country. We were also favored with a special letter for the journey to  the capital.    On this stage we started August 15, stopping the first night at  Turkmanchai, the little village where was signed the famous treaty of 1828  by virtue of which the Caspian Sea became a Russian lake. The next morning  we were on the road soon after daybreak, and on approaching the next  village overtook a curious cavalcade, just concluding a long night's  journey. This consisted of a Persian palanquin, with its long pole-shafts  saddled upon the back of a mule at each end; with servants on foot, and a  body-guard of mounted soldiers. The occupant of this peculiar conveyance  remained concealed throughout the stampede which our sudden appearance  occasioned among his hearse-bearing mules, for as such they will appear in  the sequel. In our first article we mentioned an interview in London with  Malcolm Khan, the representative of the Shah at the court of St. James.  Since then, it seemed, he had fallen into disfavor. During the late visit  of the Shah to England certain members of his retinue were so young, both  in appearance and conduct, as to be a source of mortification to the  Europeanized minister. This reached the ears of the Shah some time after  his return home; and a summons was sent for the accused to repair to  Teheran. Malcolm Khan, however, was too well versed in Oriental craft to  fall into such a trap, and announced his purpose to devote his future  leisure to airing his knowledge of Persian politics in the London press.  The Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Musht-a-Shar-el-Dowlet, then  residing at Tabreez, who was accused of carrying on a seditious  correspondence with Malcolm Khan, was differently situated, unfortunately.
