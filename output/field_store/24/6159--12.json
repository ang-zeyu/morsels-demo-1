There,  to my satisfaction, I found a mink. As I had passed a small run that  emptied into the main creek I noticed that some animal had gone over  a pole that lay across a little run and partly in the water. The  animal had brushed the snow off the pole in going over it. I gave it  no particular attention, thinking that it was a coon, but when I got  the mink I thought I would go back to camp, make a stretching board  and stretch the mink skin and get a trap and set at the run for the  coon, as I supposed.    I will mention that furs were bringing about the same prices then as  at the present time, 1907, a good No. 1 mink being worth about $10.    Near the camp was a large elm tree that was hollow, and the fire had  burned a hole out on one side up the tree, nearly as high as a man's  head. After I had stretched the mink skin I hung it up in this hollow  tree, and it was a very good place to dry the pelts that I caught.  The boys never mistrusted that I was doing any trapping for small  game.    To get back to my job, I took one out of three steel traps No. 3, and  all the traps that we had brought with us. In fact, the other boys  did not care to trap. When I got back at the run I gave more  attention to the trail of the supposed coon, and discovered that it  was an otter. With greater caution I waded up the run until I found a  suitable place to set the trap, knowing that he would be back that  way again sooner or later.    After setting the trap I climbed the ridge to look for deer and got  two shots during the afternoon but missed both. All came to camp that  night without killing any deer. I had seen a number of marten tracks  during the afternoon. The next morning it was thawing and the boys  feared they would lose the tracking snow, so Charley and Will hurried  to localities where they expected to find deer. I sliced some strips  of venison from the fore-quarters, or rather what was left of the  fore-quarters, of the deer Charley had killed the first day out. I  made tracks to the ridge where I had seen the marten tracks, and I  lost no time in putting up deadfalls at the best pace I was capable  of getting into.    In the afternoon on my way to camp I came to the creek some ways  below where I had set the mink traps, so I put up two or three more  deadfalls for mink. I also found a big flood drift which otter were  using for their feeding grounds. I selected places to set the other  two steel traps which were in camp, and then went to camp, looking at  the mink traps on the way, but found that none had been disturbed.    When I got to camp I found both Charley and Will there, and each had  killed a deer. Will had killed a good sized buck close to camp, so he  dragged it down to the shanty to dress and hang up. The boys gave me  the laugh because I had not killed any deer. I told them to hold  their breath and I would get into the harness after a bit. In the  morning the snow was all gone and the boys were afraid that it was  going to get so warm that their venison would spoil. Cuts were drawn  to see which one of them should go to Kane to get a team to take out  their venison. It fell on Charley. They tried to have me join in the  draw, but I told them that I did not see where I came in as I had no  venison to spoil.    The weather kept warm for several days, so I kept building deadfalls  on the different ridges for marten and along the creek for mink and  coon. Charley and Will continued to still hunt, killing several deer.  When the snow came again I had all the traps up I intended to build,  but it turned out that later I built two deadfalls for bear. I now  put in my time still hunting, shaping my course as much as possible  so as to tend to my traps. I killed a deer occasionally as did the  other boys. I set the two steel traps on the drift where I had seen  the otter signs, and the second time I looked at them I found an  otter tangled up in one of the traps.    I was also getting mink, marten and coon now and then, and  occasionally I would get two mink or marten in one day. I would cut a  long slender withe to stretch the skins over, bending them in the  form of a stretching board the best I could and hang the pelts in the  old elm tree and kept mum. I remembered the old adage, \"he that  laughs last, laughs best,\" and was bound to have the last laugh.    One night Will came in and said that a bear had eaten up the offal  where he had dressed a deer. I asked him if he was going to set a  trap for him, and he said that he had no trap to set. I told him to  build a deadfall. Will said that I could have that job if I wanted  it. I told him all right if he would tell me where to find the place.  He said that he would go with me in the morning and show me. In the  morning I took the best axe, some bait and went with Will to the  place where the bear had eaten the offal. We saw that the bear had  been back there during the night and cleaned up the remains left the  previous night.    I selected a good sized beech tree, where I could fell it so that I  could cut a piece from the butt for the bottom piece and have the  remainder of the tree come so that I could use a small tree for one  of the stakes or posts. When I pulled off my coat and began chopping  on the tree Will gave me the laugh again, and said that I had more  days' work in me than brains, or something to that effect.    It was my intention to get the trap all ready and then get one of the  boys to help me set it. I got the trap done and saw that by using a  long lever or pry I could set the trap without the aid of another.  With the pry I raised the dead piece up as high as I wanted it. Then  tied the lever to a sapling to hold the dead log in place, using the  figure four trigger. I placed a bit of log in the bait pen to rest  the bait spindle on. I then placed the trigger in place and pressed  them between the logs to steady them until I could release the lever  and let the weight onto the trigger. I then put some poles onto the  dead log to make doubly sure that I had weight enough to kill any  bear that traveled those woods. I now went to camp giving myself  credit of doing a good job.    When the boys came in the night of the day I built the first deadfall  for bear, they both reported seeing bear tracks and they said the  tracks all seemed to be going south. I told the boys that the bear  were looking up winter quarters, and that if we would all go at it  and put up several deadfalls we would stand a fair chance to get a  bear or two, but it was no go.    They said they would give me a clean title to all the bear I could  catch, but they did not care to invest. So I took the axe and some  bait and went to the head of a small draft where the boys had seen  the bear tracks. I found at the head of this hollow what seemed to be  a bear runway or crossing, for three or four bears had passed around  the head of this basin in the past few days.    With some hard work and heavy lifting I got another good deadfall  built that day. The next day I went the rounds of the marten and mink  traps, and I think I killed a deer and got two marten. I remember  that at this time we had a good snow to hunt on, and that it was not  an uncommon thing for us to cut wood for the camp long after dark,  and sometimes it was pretty scant at that. I think it was the third  day after I had set the first bear trap when Will came in, shortly  after Charley and I had got to camp, and as he stuck his head through  the hoghole (as I called the substitute for a door) he says, a fool  for luck.    I suspicioned what was coming and said, \"Well, what kind of luck have  you had?\"    Will said, \"It is not me that has had the luck, but you have got one  of the Jed-blasted bears up there in that rigging you built, you ever  see.\"    I remember that I had some kind of a hipo that night, so that I would  laugh every now and then \"kindy\" all by myself. I do not think that I  slept much that night, though it was not the first bear I had ever  caught. I thought it was beginning to look as though the laugh was  coming my way all right.    In the morning the boys went to the trap with me and helped get the  bear out of the trap and helped set the trap again, and then went on  with their deer hunting. I went to skinning the bear, and it was all  I did that day to skin that bear and stretch the skin on the shanty.  I told the boys when they came in that night that I thought we were  going to have a hard winter, and so I concluded to weatherboard the  camp with bear skins. The carcass of the bear was, of course, a  complete loss, and that is a serious objection to the deadfall as a  bear trap.    I think that it was about this time that Will met with an accident in  his foot gear, so he went out to Kane after a pair of gum shoes. At  this time we had several deer so thought it best to have the team  come in and take them out and ship them.    When Will came back that evening he said that some kind of an animal  had crossed the path about one-half mile from camp, dragging  something. He said that he could not make up his mind what it was,  but thought it was some kind of an animal in a trap, but we knew of  no one trapping in that locality.    I did not know but it might be possible that some animal had gotten  in one of my otter traps and had broken the chain and gone off with  the trap. Early in the morning I went down the creek to look at the  traps and see if they were all right. When I came to the Spring Run I  saw that my otter (or at least I called it my otter), had again gone  up the run, on his usual round of travel. When I came to where the  trap was it wasn't there at all.    I had fastened the trap to a root that was two or three inches under  water and a root that I supposed sound. I was mistaken, for the root  was pretty doty and the otter had broken the root and gone with my  trap. I lost no time "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#13)"],[1,"young dandies and actresses _en vogue_.  A roar of voices went up to the roof. Every one was talking, smiling,  laughing, commenting, and criticizing. It was a little picture of the  very worldly world that loves the things of to-day and the chime of the  passing hours. And suddenly some people near me were silent, and some  turned their heads to stare with a strangely fixed attention. And I saw  coming toward me an emaciated figure, rather bent, much drawn together,  walking slowly on legs like sticks. It was clad in black, with a gleam  of color. Above it was a face so intensely thin that it was like the  face of death. And in this face shone two eyes that seemed full of--the  other world. And, like a breath from the other world passing, this man  went by me and was hidden from me by the throng. It was Cardinal Manning  in the last days of his life.    The face of the king is like his, but it has an even deeper pathos as it  looks upward to the rock. And the king's silence bids you be silent,  and his immobility bids you be still. And his sad, and unutterable  resignation sifts awe, as by the desert wind the sand is sifted into the  temples, into the temple of your heart. And you feel the touch of time,  but the touch of eternity, too. And as, in that rock-hewn sanctuary, you  whisper \"_Pax vobiscum_,\" you say it for all the world.          XIV    EDFU    Prayer pervades the East. Far off across the sands, when one is  traveling in the desert, one sees thin minarets rising toward the sky.  A desert city is there. It signals its presence by this mute appeal  to Allah. And where there are no minarets--in the great wastes of the  dunes, in the eternal silence, the lifelessness that is not broken even  by any lonely, wandering bird--the camels are stopped at the appointed  hours, the poor, and often ragged, robes are laid down, the brown  pilgrims prostrate themselves in prayer. And the rich man spreads his  carpet, and prays. And the half-naked nomad spreads nothing; but he  prays, too. The East is full of lust and full of money-getting, and  full of bartering, and full of violence; but it is full of worship--of  worship that disdains concealment, that recks not of ridicule or  comment, that believes too utterly to care if others disbelieve. There  are in the East many men who do not pray. They do not laugh at the man  who does, like the unpraying Christian. There is nothing ludicrous to  them in prayer. In Egypt your Nubian sailor prays in the stern of your  dahabiyeh; and your Egyptian boatman prays by the rudder of your boat;  and your black donkey-boy prays behind a red rock in the sand; and  your camel-man prays when you are resting in the noontide, watching the  far-off quivering mirage, lost in some wayward dream.    And must you not pray, too, when you enter certain temples where once  strange gods were worshipped in whom no man now believes?    There is one temple on the Nile which seems to embrace in its arms all  the worship of the past; to be full of prayers and solemn praises; to be  the holder, the noble keeper, of the sacred longings, of the unearthly  desires and aspirations, of the dead. It is the temple of Edfu. From all  the other temples it stands apart. It is the temple of inward flame, of  the secret soul of man; of that mystery within us that is exquisitely  sensitive, and exquisitely alive; that has longings it cannot tell, and  sorrows it dare not whisper, and loves it can only love.    To Horus it was dedicated--hawk-headed Horus--the son of Isis and  Osiris, who was crowned with many crowns, who was the young Apollo  of the old Egyptian world. But though I know this, I am never able to  associate Edfu with Horus, that child wearing the side-lock--when he  is not hawk-headed in his solar aspect--that boy with his finger in his  mouth, that youth who fought against Set, murderer of his father.    Edfu, in its solemn beauty, in its perfection of form, seems to me to  pass into a region altogether beyond identification with the worship of  any special deity, with particular attributes, perhaps with particular  limitations; one who can be graven upon walls, and upon architraves and  pillars painted in brilliant colors; one who can personally pursue a  criminal, like some policeman in the street; even one who can rise  upon the world in the visible glory of the sun. To me, Edfu must always  represent the world-worship of \"the Hidden One\"; not Amun, god of the  dead, fused with Ra, with Amsu, or with Khnum: but that other \"Hidden  One,\" who is God of the happy hunting-ground of savages, with whom the  Buddhist strives to merge his strange serenity of soul; who is adored in  the \"Holy Places\" by the Moslem, and lifted mystically above the heads  of kneeling Catholics in cathedrals dim with incense, and merrily  praised with the banjo and the trumpet in the streets of black English  cities; who is asked for children by longing women, and for new dolls  by lisping babes; whom the atheist denies in the day, and fears in the  darkness of night; who is on the lips alike of priest and blasphemer,  and in the soul of all human life.    Edfu stands alone, not near any other temple. It is not pagan; it is not  Christian: it is a place in which to worship according to the dictates  of your heart.    Edfu stands alone on the bank of the Nile between Luxor and Assuan. It  is not very far from El-Kab, once the capital of Upper Egypt, and it is  about two thousand years old. The building of it took over one hundred  and eighty years, and it is the most perfectly preserved temple to-day  of all the antique world. It is huge and it is splendid. It has towers  one hundred and twelve feet high, a propylon two hundred and fifty-two  feet broad, and walls four hundred and fifty feet long. Begun in the  reign of Ptolemy III., it was completed only fifty-seven years before  the birth of Christ.    You know these facts about it, and you forget them, or at least you do  not think of them. What does it all matter when you are alone in Edfu?  Let the antiquarian go with his anxious nose almost touching the stone;  let the Egyptologist peer through his glasses at hieroglyphs and puzzle  out the meaning of cartouches: but let us wander at ease, and worship  and regard the exquisite form, and drink in the mystical spirit, of this  very wonderful temple.    Do you care about form? Here you will find it in absolute perfection.  Edfu is the consecration of form. In proportion it is supreme above  all other Egyptian temples. Its beauty of form is like the chiselled  loveliness of a perfect sonnet. While the world lasts, no architect can  arise to create a building more satisfying, more calm with the calm of  faultlessness, more serene with a just serenity. Or so it seems to me. I  think of the most lovely buildings I know in Europe--of the Alhambra at  Granada, of the Cappella Palatina in the palace at Palermo. And Edfu  I place with them--Edfu utterly different from them, more different,  perhaps, even than they are from each other, but akin to them, as all  great beauty is mysteriously akin. I have spent morning after morning  in the Alhambra, and many and many an hour in the Cappella Palatina; and  never have I been weary of either, or longed to go away. And this same  sweet desire to stay came over me in Edfu. The _Loulia_ was tied up by  the high bank of the Nile. The sailors were glad to rest. There was no  steamer sounding its hideous siren to call me to its crowded deck. So I  yielded to my desire, and for long I stayed in Edfu. And when at last  I left it I said to myself, \"This is a supreme thing,\" and I knew that  within me had suddenly developed the curious passion for buildings that  some people never feel, and that others feel ever growing and growing.    Yes, Edfu is supreme. No alteration could improve it. Any change made in  it, however slight, could only be harmful to it. Pure and perfect is its  design--broad propylon, great open courtyard with pillared galleries,  halls, chambers, sanctuary. Its dignity and its sobriety are matchless.  I know they must be, because they touched me so strangely, with a kind  of reticent enchantment, and I am not by nature enamored of sobriety, of  reticence and calm, but am inclined to delight in almost violent  force, in brilliance, and, especially, in combinations of color. In  the Alhambra one finds both force and fairylike lightness, delicious  proportions, delicate fantasy, a spell as of subtle magicians; in the  Cappella Palatina, a jeweled splendor, combined with a small perfection  of form which simply captivates the whole spirit and leads it to  adoration. In Edfu you are face to face with hugeness and with grandeur;  but soon you are scarcely aware of either--in the sense, at least, that  connects these qualities with a certain overwhelming, almost striking  down, of the spirit and the faculties. What you are aware of is your  own immense and beautiful calm of utter satisfaction--a calm which has  quietly inundated you, like a waveless tide of the sea. How rare it is  to feel this absolute satisfaction, this praising serenity! The critical  spirit goes, like a bird from an opened window. The excited, laudatory,  voluble spirit goes. And this splendid calm is left. If you stay here,  you, as this temple has been, will be molded into a beautiful sobriety.  From the top of the pylon you have received this still and glorious  impression from the matchless design of the whole building, which you  see best from there. When you descend the shallow staircase, when you  stand in the great court, when you go into the shadowy halls, then it is  that the utter satisfaction within you deepens. Then it is that you feel  the need to worship in this place created for worship.    The ancient Egyptians made most of their temples in conformity with  a single type. The sanctuary was at the heart, the core, of each  temple--the sanctuary surrounded by the chambers in which were"]]]
