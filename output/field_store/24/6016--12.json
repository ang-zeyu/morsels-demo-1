SCENT      The keenness of a dog's nose is, of course, proverbial, and I have only  put a few tests to Lola in this particular, yet, such as they are  (proving perhaps no more than is already known) I will here set down. I  put the first of these tests to her on the 17 April, 1916. I showed her  a book belonging to my father and said:    \"Whose book is this?\" She answered--\"Father!\" Then I showed her a glove  and she told me it was mine. On 20 April, I showed her another glove  belonging to a lady who was commonly known among us as \"Mama\" and Lola  instantly replied with--\"Mama!\" This was followed by an important test  in the afternoon of the same day. Four ladies, who were strangers to  her had come to my father's place at Hohenheim, and in helping them  take off their wraps I did not particularly notice where the different  articles of clothing were laid. Lola was in the room at the time, I  introduced the ladies to her singly and by name and later on sent her  to fetch one of the hats. She fetched it and then sat expectantly  before me. \"To whom does this hat belong?\" I asked. The answer was:  \"Sibol.\" I then asked Fraeulein Sibold who was present if it really was  her hat and she said--\"yes.\" Lola had remembered the name quite well  but had left out the final \"d\"--an omission due to the fact that I am  in the habit of \"swallowing\" that letter when saying the name. On 29  December, 1916, I gave Lola a biscuit and she seemed more than usually  delighted with its smell--as if there was something familiar about it.  \"Why ever are you so pleased?\" I asked, to which she replied--\"Mama!\"  And it had actually been sent by the aforementioned lady familiarly  known as \"Mama.\" I then showed her another biscuit, saying \"Is this too  from Mama?\" but she answered \"no!\" \"Do you dogs always know by smell?\"  I said--and she rapped \"yes!\" On this same day another test failed  owing to the impossibility of ascertaining the true name of the article  in question.    I had a new jacket trimmed with fur--a variety unknown to me, it was  grey and slightly woolly. Lola could simply not tear herself away from  it--the smell was so fascinating. I said to her: \"Tell me what is  delighting you so to-day?\" She replied--\"_mederesf_.\" Unable to make  any sense of the letters I set them down in writing before her and  asked her if any of them were wrong; to this she replied: \"yes:\"  \"Which?\" asked I--she said: \"2.\" (_the second_) \"What should it be?\" I  queried; she rapped \"n.\" \"How many of these letters belong to the first  word?\" I continued. \"2.\" \"And to the second?\" She gave a wavering  six--(though it may have been _five_). So the words purported to be \"ne  deresf.\" I could make nothing of it and asked her again--\"What _is_  deresf?\" to which she gave the explanation: \"ein tir.\" (tier = animal)  \"_An animal_? but I don't know the name! have you heard of it?\" \"Yes!\"  \"Have we seen this animal?\" \"Yes!\" \"Where did we see it?\" \"Maulburg.\"[16]  \"In the house?\" \"No.\" \"In the woods?\" \"Yes!\" \"Spell the name again!\" \"d  r e s f.\" \"And what is n e?\" \"dran\" (a contraction of daran = on it).  \"On the jacket?\" \"Yes!\" \"Then you want to say that 'dresf' is on the  jacket?\" \"Yes....\" And Lola looked at me with the most imploring eyes  as though I _ought to see that she was right_--as though _I ought to  know it_.          [16] Maulburg, near Schopfheim, in Baden, where Lola had visited        relations of mine.    \"Are you _sure_ of the name?\" I persisted--and she replied: \"mittel.\"[17]  Here we ended--and unfortunately I have not been able to ascertain so  far what this particular variety of fur is!          [17] Mittel = unbestimmt (uncertain; from Mitte = middle.)    There have been more recent tests of this nature, about which I do not  as yet feel in a position to give a definite opinion. They may possibly  come into line with the theories held by Professor Gustav Jaegar, M.D.,  of Stuttgart and, if so, would place the subject in a new perspective.  I will now only add what has so far come to my notice accidentally:    On 4 October, 1916, I said: \"Lola, do you like to smell people?\" \"Yes!\"  \"All people?\" \"No!\" \"How do I smell to-day?\" \"Tired.\" \"Lola,\" I said,  \"do I sometimes smell horrid?\" \"Arger Eifersucht!\" ( = great, or strong  jealousy) \"So you smell what I feel and when it changes?\" \"Yes.\" \"With  every one?\" \"Yes.\" \"With horses too?\" \"No.\" \"With dogs?\" \"Yes! yes!!\"    On 5 October I asked: \"Lola, do I smell the same?\" \"No!\" \"How do I  smell?\" \"Angst\" ( = fear, or anxiety). She evidently meant that I was  uneasy on account of the amount of work.    \"Lola,\" I continued, \"how does Betty smell?\" \"Nach Angst\" ( = of  anxiety) \"And anything more?\" \"Auch mued\" ( = also tired). [N.B. Betty  had held out the palms of her hands to the dog.] \"And anything more?\"  \"Ja--traurig\" ( = yes--sad.) And I found later that this had been the  true state of Betty's feelings at the time.    Lola was bright and fresh and this encouraged me to continue:    \"What does Magda smell like?\" \"Afe.\" \"Is that right?\" \"No--a f.\" \"And  what more?\" \"g e r e g t\" \"afgeregt? Isn't one letter wrong?\" \"Yes.\"  \"Which?\" \"1\" \"Then what should it be?\" \"Au.\" \"Then you mean aufgeregt?\"  (excited) \"Yes!\"    6 October. \"Lola, do I smell different to-day?\" \"Yes--strong\" \"Yes! go  on?\" \"O w e.\" \"We?\" (weh = pain) \"Like pain?\" \"No.\" \"You meant like the  exclamation--'O weh'?\" \"Yes!\" \"But what do I smell of?\" \"Of surogat\"  (!) The use of this word by Lola seemed to be abnormal and mysterious,  so I said \"I am sure you have never heard that word from me!\" and she  replied \"No!\" \"Tell me the name of the surogat?\" \"1\"--(which stands for  \"I will not tell!\") \"Tell me! for you know the word for it!\" I  insisted. \"Yes!\" \"_Please tell me_?\" \"1\"--\"I will not be angry,\" I  pleaded, \"I will give you a biscuit.\" But Lola returned again a  reluctant \"1.\" \"What is this 1 to mean, Lola--is it yes or no?\" \"4\" ( =  mittel). She would not look at me and while seemingly desirous of  \"insinuating\" something, was yet not quite ready to make a frank  acknowledgment of the implication. \"Lola, tell me!\" I exclaimed, and  she rapped \"Luigen.\" \"_Luegen_?\" (lying) \"Ja--nein.\" \"Lola! I won't  be angry; do I smell of lies?\" \"Yes.\" \"Here at home?\" \"Minchen.\"  (Muenchen = Munich.) And then it suddenly dawned on me; an hour earlier  I had told the dog that I was going to Munich and that perhaps she  might go with me. Yet at the same time I was by no means so sure that  this could be managed, and thought therefore of taking her to  Stuttgart. People may smile when they read these things--indeed I have  often smiled myself, but I cannot help it if Lola chooses to give such  answers! Probably the future may bring me further enlightenment! There  were many more occasions on which I was able to test Lola's quick nose  in taking up the scent of human beings as well as of game and also the  smell attaching to different articles. I need not particularize these,  for anyone possessing a dog with a keen nose may know this as well as I  do--or, even better.          SENSITIVENESS OF THE SKIN      The time at my disposal has unfortunately not been sufficient to enable  me to engage on any very careful tests as to the sensitiveness of  Lola's skin. Yet I have made certain preliminary notes as to what I  hope to do in this connexion, and have also begun with a few tentative  attempts. I first tried her sensibility to various degrees of warmth by  teaching her the use of the thermometer. I made a drawing of a  thermometer--according to its actual size--and added principal numbers  and figures and also        at 100 deg., water becomes air = hot.      at 0 deg., water becomes hard = cold.    and beneath this I wrote:        from 1-100 upwards, it becomes always hotter,      from 0-40 downwards, it becomes always colder,    and I concluded with a few more verbal elucidations, and then fetched  an actual thermometer on which I made her read me the temperature of  the room. The next day I repeated this lesson and she read the  thermometer again. After this I tested her as to whether she could give  the temperature by the \"feel,\" as it were, or whether the impression of  the temperature was associated more immediately with a sense of  comfort. She has so far always given the right temperature when asked,  though I should add that I have only put the question to her about  twenty times--and then when she has been in good health, so that I feel  that the matter has not yet been sufficiently put to the proof, and I  cannot, therefore, make any very definite statements with regard to  this particular faculty. But I must add, that to two questions put to  her on different days, she answered that she \"liked her food best at 6 deg.  of warmth!\" Now this chimes with the advice given in many a book on the  care of dogs; \"do not give them their food too hot\"--and Lola's remark  reminded me of this, though I might consider that \"degree of heat\"  practically _cool_ ... yet it appeared to be what she desired.  Nevertheless, this preference turned out shortly to have been erroneous  and, as the result of a practical trial, Lola changed her mind and  voted for anything \"between 12 deg.--16 deg.!\" Here is one more test I put with  regard to her susceptibility to touch: I got someone else to trace  figures with their fingers on the dog's back, placing myself so that I  could not see what was being described; then I put the questions, and  each time her replies tallied almost invariably. One put to her in this  manner was: \"2 + 3?\"; and \"5\" was given at once. While \"7 + 4?\"  elicited a prompt \"11.\" Then a number was described and I said: \"Twice "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25918"],[0,"Heads and Tales : or, Anecdotes and Stories of Quadrupeds and Other Beasts, (#13)"],[1,"rifles arrayed before him,  paid such devoted attention to a bottle of spirits he had brought with  him, that he quite forgot the object of his coming. At last, however, a  huge bear burst suddenly from the cover of the pine forest, directly in  front of him. At that moment the bottle was raised so high that it quite  obscured the general's vision, and he did not perceive the intruder till  he was close upon him. Down went the bottle, up jumped the astonished  soldier, and, forgetful of his guns, off he started, with the bear  clutching at the tails of his greatcoat as he ran away. What strange  confusion of ideas was muddling the general's intellect at the moment it  is difficult to say, but I suspect he had some notion that the attack  was an act of insubordination on the part of Bruin, for he called out  most lustily, as he ran along, 'Back, rascal! back! I am a general!'  Luckily, a poor Wallack peasant had more respect for the epaulettes  than the bear, and, throwing himself in the way, with nothing but a  spear for his defence, he kept the enemy at bay till our friend and the  jaegers came up, and finished the contest with their rifles.\"      BYRON'S BEAR AT CAMBRIDGE.    When at Trinity College, Cambridge, Lord Byron had a strange pet. He  \"brought up a bear for a degree.\" He said to Captain Medwyn,[31] \"I had  a great hatred of college rules, and contempt for academical honours.  How many of their wranglers have ever distinguished themselves in the  world? There was, by the by, rather a witty satire founded on my bear. A  friend of Shelley's made an ourang-outang (Oran Hanton, Esq.) the hero  of a novel ('Melincourt'), had him created a baronet, and returned for  the borough of One Vote.\"      CHARLES DICKENS ON BEARS' GREASE AND ITS PRODUCERS.    Any one who has been long resident in London, or who has passed through  Fenchurch Street, or Everett Street, Russell Square, must have been  struck with the way in which \"bears' grease\" is or used to be advertised  in these localities. Dickens makes Mr Samuel Weller tell of an  enthusiastic tradesman of this description.[32]    \"His whole delight was in his trade. He spent all his money in bears,  and run in debt for 'em besides, and there they wos a growling away in  the front cellar all day long and ineffectually gnashing their teeth,  vile the grease o' their relations and friends wos being retailed in  gallipots in the shop above, and the first floor winder wos ornamented  with their heads; not to speak o' the dreadful aggrawation it must have  been to 'em to see a man always a walkin' up and down the pavement  outside, with the portrait of a bear in his last agonies, and  underneath, in large letters, 'Another fine animal was slaughtered  yesterday at Jenkinson's!' Hous'ever, there they wos, and there  Jenkinson wos, till he was took very ill with some inward disorder, lost  the use of his legs, and wos confined to his bed, vere he laid a wery  long time; but sich wos his pride in his profession even then, that  wenever he wos worse than usual the doctor used to go down-stairs, and  say, 'Jenkinson's wery low this mornin', we must give the bears a stir;'  and as sure as ever they stirred 'em up a bit, and made 'em roar,  Jenkinson opens his eyes, if he wos ever so bad, calls out, 'There's the  bears!' and rewives agin.\"    The author of a most amusing article in the seventy-seventh volume of  the _Edinburgh Review_, on the modern system of advertising, records  that, in his puff, the first vendor of bears' grease cautioned his  customers to wash their hands in warm water after using it, to prevent  them from assuming the hairy appearance of a paw.      A BEARABLE PUN.    An illiterate vendor of beer wrote over his door at Harrowgate, \"_Bear_  sold here.\" \"He spells the word quite correctly,\" said Theodore Hook,  \"if he means to apprise us that the article is his own _Bruin_.\"[33]    [Illustration: Polar Bear. (Thalassarctos maritimus.)]      SHAVED BEAR.    Robert Southey (\"Common-Place Book,\" 4th ser., p. 359) says:--\"At  Bristol I saw a shaved monkey shown for a fairy; and a shaved bear, in a  check waistcoat and trousers, sitting in a great chair as an Ethiopian  savage. This was the most cruel fraud I ever saw. The unnatural position  of the beast, and the damnable brutality of the woman-keeper, who sat  upon his knee, put her arm round his neck, called him husband and  sweetheart, and kissed him, made it the most disgusting spectacle I ever  witnessed. Cottle was with me.\"    He also tells of a fellow exhibiting a dragon-fly under a magnifier at a  country fair, and calling it the great High German \"Heiter-Keiter.\"      THE POLAR BEAR.    (_Thalassarctos maritimus._[34])    Notwithstanding ice and snow, and the darkness of a nine months' winter,  the Arctic regions are tenanted by several mammalia. Some of these are  constant residents, the rest are migratory visitors. Of the former  division, one of the most conspicuous, as it is certainly the most  formidable, is the polar bear,--a creature between eight and nine feet  in length, which, shuffling along the snow at a very quick pace, and  being an excellent swimmer besides, cannot fail to inspire dread. The  large wide head and fearfully armed jaws are united by a strong neck to  powerful shoulders, from which spring the thick and muscular fore-legs.  The paws, both of the fore and of the hind feet, are broad and admirably  adapted, with their long hairy covering, to keep the polar bear from  sinking in the snow. Although the creature has an appearance of  clumsiness, it is the reverse of inactive. Every one who knows the  boundless spaces it has to traverse, when in a state of liberty and the  \"monarch of all it surveys,\" cannot but pity it as a prisoner in the  Regent's Park, where a tolerably capacious den, supplied with a bath of  water of very limited dimension, affords the restless creature less  liberty than a squirrel has in its round-about, or a poor lark in its  cage.    Voyagers to the Arctic regions describe it as wandering over the fields  of ice, mounting the hummocks,[35] and looking around for prey. With  outstretched head, its little but keen eye directed to the various  points of a wide horizon, the polar bear looks out for seals; or scents  with its quick nostrils the luscious smell of some stinking  whale-blubber or half-putrid whale-flesh. Dr Scoresby relates[36] that a  piece of the _kreng_ of a whale thrown into the fire drew a bear to a  ship from the distance of miles. Captain Beechey mentions, that his  party in 1818, as they were off the coast of Spitzbergen, by setting on  fire some fat of the walrus, soon attracted a bear to their close  vicinity. This polar Bruin was evidently unaccustomed to the sight of  masts, and, when approaching, occasionally hesitated, and seemed half  inclined to turn round and be off. So agreeable a smell as burning  walrus fat dispelled all distrust, and brought him within musket-shot.  On receiving the first ball, he sprang round, growled terrifically, and  half raised himself on his hind-legs, as if expecting to seize the  object which had caused so much pain; woe to any one who had at that  moment been within reach of his merciless paws! Although a second and  third ball laid him writhing on the ice, he was not mastered; and on the  butt end of a musket directed at his head breaking short off, the bear  quickly seized the thigh of his assailant, and, but for the immediate  assistance of two or three of his shipmates, the man would have been  seriously injured. In these very seas--nearly fifty years before--the  hero of Trafalgar encountered this Arctic tyrant, and, when missed from  his ship, was discovered with a comrade attacking a large specimen,  separated from them by a chasm in the ice. On being reprimanded by his  captain for his foolhardiness, \"Sir,\" said the young middy, pouting his  lips, as he used to do when excited, \"I wished to kill the bear that I  might carry the skin to my father.\"[37]    Barentz, in his celebrated voyage in 1595, had two of his men killed by  \"a great leane white beare.\" In these early days, so unused were polar  bears to man, that though thirty of their comrades attempted a rescue,  the prey was not abandoned. The purser, \"stepping somewhat farther  forward, and seeing the beare to be within the length of a shot,  presently levelled his peece, and discharging it at the beare, shot her  into the head, betweene both the eyes, and yet shee held the man still  fast by the necke, and lifted up her head with the man in her mouth, but  shee beganne somewhat to stagger; wherewith the purser and a Scottishman  drew out their courtlaxes (cutlasses), and stroke at her so hard, that  their courtlaxes burst, and yet shee would not leave the man. At last  Wm. Geysen went to them, and with all his might stroke the beare upon  the snowt with his peece, at which time the beare fell to the ground,  making a great noyse, and Wm. Geysen leaping upon her cut her throat.  The 7th of September wee buried the dead bodies of our men in the States  Island, and having fleaed the beare, carryed her skinne to Amsterdam.\"    This is about the earliest record of an encounter with this formidable  creature; sailors now find that they can be attacked with most advantage  in the water. When in this element, they try to escape by swimming to  the ice, and when the ice is in the form of loose and detached small  floes, Dr Sutherland has seen them dive underneath, and appear on the  opposite side. Scoresby records, that when shot at a distance, and able  to escape, the bear has been observed to retire to the shelter of a  hummock, and, as if aware of the styptical effect of cold, apply snow to  the wound.    In common with nearly every animal, this huge despot of the North is  strongly attached to its young. Captain Inglefield, on his return home  from Baffin's Bay in 1852, pursued three bears, as he was anxious to get  a supply of "]]]
