One evening a  sapping party recommenced operations quite near to Claud and his  friends.    \"At it again,\" Bill remarked.    \"Yes, they're a beastly nuisance, I'll have to worry them a bit,\" said  Claud, picking up a little paper bag.  He fixed a piece of thin white  string round it, then jumped over the parapet.  It was quite dark, so  he was perfectly safe.  Crawling on his hands and knees, he at last  reached within ten yards of the sapping Turks.  For a few minutes he  lay still.  His eyes got used to the darkness, enabling him to get a  glimpse of the diggers.  Pulling out the paper bag, he threw it smartly  towards the hole.  It burst on the edge of the parapet and the contents  scattered all round.  Claud waited.    Aitchoo! went one.    Aitchoo! went another.    Aitchoo! went a third.    Aitchoo!  Aitchoo!  Aitchoo! sneezed all the Turks between their  oriental grunts and curses.    Claud burst out laughing and so gave himself away.  A head popped out  of the hole.  Claud was seen.  Down it went, and up came a rifle, but  before the Turk could fire, Claud, who had a couple of bombs prepared,  flung them into the hole.  There was a loud bang! bang! followed by a  series of shouts, shrieks and moans.  The sapping party fled for their  lives.  This was as Claud desired, so he quietly crawled back to his  trench.    \"Got 'em that time, Dufair,\" said an officer as he tumbled in.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"By the way, what was all the sneezing about?\"    \"A little trick, sir,\" laughed Claud.    \"Was it snuff you chucked at them?\"    \"No, common or garden pepper, issued with the rations.\"    \"Good,\" said the officer pursuing his rounds.    Now it was on this same evening that Paddy Doolan roused the whole  regiment to a state of alarm.  He was on sentry go on the extreme left  of his regiment's line.  Being dark, Paddy began to feel the effects of  things supernatural.  Every sound, every moving leaf or blade was a  Turk.  He had fired at a few nothings, and during a spell of silence he  was amazed to hear on his left a chattering in a strange tongue.    \"Turks, be Jasus, they're in our trenches.  Mother of Mary, preserve  us,\" said Paddy, crossing himself.  He listened again.  They were  chanting a weird dirge.  It was something between a Highland lament and  a Hindoo snake song.  Paddy was amazed.  Life seemed to be a shorter  affair, and he pictured himself lying dead on the parapet with his  throat cut.  His teeth were chattering, and his nerves on the run.  At  last he managed to bellow out, \"Stand to!\"  The half-sleeping men  jumped to their rifles and waited below the parapet.    \"What's up, Doolan?\" said the officer on reaching them.    \"Turks in our trenches, sor.  Heaven preserve us.\"    \"Where?\"    \"There, sor!  There, sor!  Listen to them.\"    The officer listened.  He heard the weird chanting.  It wasn't English,  it didn't seem Turkish.  What on earth was it, he wondered.  At last he  made up his mind.    \"Here, six of you fix bayonets, follow me,\" and down the communication  trench he crouched and crawled towards the left.  They now neared the  weird chanting noise.  The officer cocked his revolver and whispered  back, \"Get ready, boys.\" Then, dashing round a bend, he burst on to a  dark-skinned group.    \"Hands up!\" he shouted.    \"What's up, boss?\" said a smiling dusky gent in khaki, with a New  Zealand badge on his shoulder.    \"Who the deuce are you?\"    \"Maoris, boss, Maoris.\"    \"Hang it all, I thought you were Turks.  Good night.\"    \"Good night, boss,\" shouted the laughing Maoris--the finest  dark-skinned gentlemen in the world.          CHAPTER IX    A BRAVE NEW ZEALANDER    There's a difference between the New Zealander and Australian, and the  difference is this: when an Australian says \"Home,\" he means Australia;  when a New Zealander says \"Home,\" he means the Old Country.  The sense  of nationality is deep in the Australian's soul; the sense of  dependence and kinship is wrapped round the New Zealander's heart.  Australia is the older Dominion, and the Australian, like the Canadian,  is keen on running his own affairs.  New Zealand is younger; many of  its first settlers are still alive, so their eyes and their children's  eyes are always turned to the land called \"Home.\"    Fifty years hence the New Zealander will be like the Australian--a keen  exponent of nationhood and all that that means.  But, understand, when  I speak of nationhood as applied to the Australian and New Zealander, I  mean pride of race, pride of dominion, pride of achievement, and the  ability to be a partner in the great Empire that is ours.  Our  forefathers resented this attitude of our colonial cousins.  For that  reason we lost the American colonies.  That lesson was good.  We now  realise that it is good business to let such as the Australian and New  Zealander manage their own affairs.  It saves us worry, it saves  expense, it breeds a distinct type--a type conscious of their ability,  but aware of the need of co-operation and co-ordination in Imperial  defence and Imperial trade.  Wise men ask no more.    Now in affairs of war there is also a difference between the New  Zealander and Australian.  The Australian resembles the  Irishman--daring, desperate, and frequently reckless; the New Zealander  resembles the Scot--equally daring, equally determined, but more canny  and cautious.  In brief, the New Zealander is more ready to weigh the  issues and count the cost.  Both types are necessary in war; both are  extremely useful.  Now I have reached my tale.    The General Staff had heard that the Turks were concentrating men and  munitions for a great attack.  Information was scarce; information was  imperative, for on information the modern general depends.  And this  information had to come from the very centre of the Turkish defence.  It was the hour for a man, and that man had to be found.  That was the  problem which faced the Chief of Staff.  He knew that almost every  officer would volunteer.  He thought of many Australians; but no, their  reckless bravery might wreck his schemes.  And then he pictured in his  eye the New Zealanders he knew.  One by one they passed in review.  At  last he recalled \"Tony,\" a young subaltern from Hawkes Bay.  He was a  graduate of an Auckland school--a strong, well-built, swarthy youth,  with that coolness, daring, and acumen necessary for the job.  \"Yes,  he'll do,\" muttered the Chief as he rang up the New Zealand Dragoons.    \"Send Lieutenant Tony Brown to headquarters at once.\"    \"Very good, sir,\" answered an orderly.  In two hours Tony entered the  dug-out and saluted.    \"I've a job for you, Mr. Brown.  It might mean your death; it might  mean the D.S.O.  Are you on?\"    \"I'm on, sir; but please explain.\"    \"Get one of the Navy boats.  Go up the coast for two miles.  Land and  get across into the Turkish camp.  Find out the strength of these  reinforcements, the guns, the ammunition, food and water supplies, and,  more important, the probable date, if not the hour, of this big attack.  I'll give you two days to do it.  If you're not back on the third day  I'll count you as dead.  Understand?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Very well, my lad.  Here's an order to the commander of the torpedo  boat at the beach.  Make your own arrangements.  Good luck to you,\"  concluded the Chief, shaking him by the hand.  And out went Tony on his  job.  It was a tough proposition for a youngster to tackle, yet he  deemed it an honour.  And there was no time for delay.  He secured the  services of two Maoris because of their strength and swarthy  complexion.  Turkish uniforms would make them \"Turks,\" if need be.    The commander of the destroyer gave him a boat.  This was loaded up  with water, biscuits, some Turkish uniforms, and rifles, with other  necessaries for the job.  At night they pulled out.  It was quite dark,  so all was favourable at the outset.  For hours the Maoris seemed to  row, their only guide being the stars and dark coast-line.  And then  came the first peep of dawn.    \"Come on, you fellows; get into these things,\" said the subaltern,  pointing to the Turkish clothes.  He did likewise.  The disguise was  perfect.  They looked thoroughly respectable members of the Sultan's  community.    \"Ease in now, boys,\" ordered Tony as the light grew better.  Gently  they pulled to the shore.    \"That place will do,\" muttered the observant sub, looking towards a  shingly sort of beach beneath some cliffs.  The boat grated on the  pebbles.  They had arrived on their daring mission.    \"Now, look here, you boys; you've got to loaf round here for two days.  Hide the boat and get into a dug-out.  Keep a look-out for me.  If I  don't come back at the end of the second day, go back and tell them  I've gone to Kingdom Come.  Understand?\"    \"All right, boss,\" said the elder of the Maoris, a full corporal.  And  off went Tony.  He climbed up the cliffs and found himself on a scrubby  sort of soil dotted here and there with stunted trees.  Away to his  right he could just discern the Turkish defences, while immediately in  front lay some scattered redoubts of the flanking outposts of the  enemy.  In the distance was a high, grassy knoll--a perfect place for  observing things.  He made for it, avoiding contact with some  straggling Turkish soldiers on the way.  By the way, it is really  remarkable how one can walk through an enemy's lines when dressed in  their uniform; but it takes a stout heart to do it.    Tony reached the foot of the knoll and commenced to ascend.  Just as he  reached the top he was startled by a Turk who cried out a greeting.  He  mumbled something in a boorish style and dropped down in a friendly way  beside his man.  Before the old Turk realised what was happening he lay  dead with a revolver bullet in his brains.    \"Phew!  What a noise!\" muttered Tony as he looked at his victim and  then all round the hill to see if the noise had alarmed the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2546"],[0,"Hopalong Cassidy's Rustler Round-Up; Or, Bar-20 (#13)"],[1,"his being in his  official position for fifteen years. A gentleman at the core, he was  well educated and had visited a goodly portion of the world. A book of  Horace lay open on his knees and on the table at his side lay a shining  new revolver, Hopalong having carried off his former weapon. He read  aloud several lines and in reaching for a light for his cigarette  noticed the new six-shooter. His mind leaped from Horace to Hopalong,  and he smiled grimly at the latter's promise to call.    Glancing up, his eyes fell on a poster which conveyed the information in  Spanish and in English that there was offered          +--------------------------------------+             | |  FIVE HUNDRED PESOS | |                        REWARD             For Hopalong Cassidy, of the Ranch          | | Known as the Bar-20, Texas, U. S. A. | |          +--------------------------------------+    and which gave a good description of that gentleman.    Sighing for the five hundred, he again took up his book and was lost in  its pages when he heard a knock, rather low and timid. Wearily laying  aside his reading, he strode to the door, expecting to hear a lengthy  complaint from one of his townsmen. As he threw the door wide open the  light streamed out and lighted up a revolver and behind it the beaming  face of a cowboy, who grinned.    \"Well, I'll be damned!\" ejaculated the sheriff, starting back in  amazement.    \"Don't say that, sheriff; you've got lots of time to reform,\" replied a  humorous voice. \"How's th' wings?\"    \"Almost well: you were considerate,\" responded the sheriff. \"Let's go  in--somebody might see me out here an' get into trouble,\" suggested the  visitor, placing his foot on the sill.    \"Certainly--pardon my discourtesy,\" said the sheriff. \"You see, I  wasn't expecting you to-night,\" he explained, thinking of the  elaborate preparations that he would have gone to if he had thought the  irrepressible would call.    \"Well, I was down this way, an' seeing as how I had promised to drop  in I just natchurally dropped,\" replied Hopalong as he took the chair  proffered by his host.    After talking awhile on everything and nothing the sheriff coughed and  looked uneasily at his guest.    \"Mr. Cassidy, I am sorry you called, for I like men of your energy and  courage and I very much dislike to arrest you,\" remarked the sheriff.  \"Of course you understand that you are under arrest,\" he added with  anxiety.    \"Who, me?\" Asked Hopalong with a rising inflection.    \"Most assuredly,\" breathed the sheriff.    \"Why, this is the first time I ever heard anything about it,\" replied  the astonished cow-puncher. \"I'm an American--don't that make any  difference?\"    \"Not in this case, I'm afraid. You see, it's for manslaughter.\"    \"Well, don't that beat th' devil, now?\" Said Hopalong. He felt sorry  that a citizen of the glorious United States should be prey for  troublesome sheriffs, but he was sure that his duty to Texas called upon  him never to submit to arrest at the hands of a Mexican. Remembering  the Alamo, and still behind his Colt, he reached over and took up the  shining weapon from the table and snapped it open on his knee. After  placing the cartridges in his pocket he tossed the gun over on the bed  and, reaching inside his shirt, drew out another and threw it after the  first.    \"That's yore gun; I forgot to leave it,\" he said, apologetically.  \"Anyhow yu needs two,\" he added.    Then he glanced around the room, noticed the poster and walked over  and read it. A full swift sweep of his gloved hand tore it from its  fastenings and crammed it under his belt. The glimmer of anger in his  eyes gave way as he realized that his head was worth a definite price,  and he smiled at what the boys would say when he showed it to them.  Planting his feet far apart and placing his arms akimbo he faced his  host in grim defiance.    \"Got any more of these?\" He inquired, placing his hand on the poster  under his belt.    \"Several,\" replied the sheriff.    \"Trot 'em out,\" ordered Hopalong shortly.    The sheriff sighed, stretched and went over to a shelf, from which he  took a bundle of the articles in question. Turning slowly he looked at  the puncher and handed them to him.    \"I reckons they's all over this here town,\" remarked Hopalong.    \"They are, and you may never see Texas again.\"    \"So? Well, yu tell yore most particular friends that the job is worth  five thousand, and that it will take so many to do it that when th'  mazuma is divided up it won't buy a meal. There's only one man in this  country tonight that can earn that money, an' that's me,\" said the  puncher. \"An' I don't need it,\" he added, smiling.    \"But you are my prisoner--you are under arrest,\" enlightened the sheriff,  rolling another cigarette. The sheriff spoke as if asking a question.  Never before had five hundred dollars been so close at hand and yet so  unobtainable. It was like having a check-book but no bank account.    \"I'm shore sorry to treat yu mean,\" remarked Hopalong, \"but I was paid a  month in advance an' I'll have to go back an' earn it.\"    \"You can--if you say that you will return,\" replied the sheriff  tentatively. The sheriff meant what he said and for the moment had  forgotten that he was powerless and was not the one to make terms.    Hopalong was amazed and for a time his ideas of Mexicans staggered under  the blow. Then he smiled sympathetically as he realized that he faced a  white man.    \"Never like to promise nothin',\" he replied. \"I might get plugged, or  something might happen that wouldn't let me.\" Then his face lighted up  as a thought came to him. \"Say, I'll cut di' cards with yu to see if I  comes back or not.\"    The sheriff leaned back and gazed at the cool youngster before him.  A smile of satisfaction, partly at the self-reliance of his guest and  partly at the novelty of his situation, spread over his face. He reached  for a pack of Mexican cards and laughed. \"Man! You're a cool one--I'll do  it. What do you call?\"    \"Red,\" answered Hopalong.    The sheriff slowly raised his hand and revealed the ace of hearts.  Hopalong leaned back and laughed, at the same time taking from his  pocket the six extracted cartridges. Arising and going over to the  bed he slipped them in the chambers of the new gun and then placed the  loaded weapon at the sheriff's elbow.    \"Well, I reckon I'll amble, sheriff,\" he said as he opened the door. \"If  yu ever sifts up my way drop in an' see me--th' boys'll give yu a good  time.\"    \"Thanks; I will be glad to,\" replied the sheriff. \"You'll take your  pitcher to the well once too often some day, my friend. This courtesy,\"  glancing at the restored revolver, \"might have cost you dearly.\"    \"Shoo! I did that once an' th' feller tried to use it,\" replied  the cowboy as he backed through the door. \"Some people are awfully  careless,\" he added. \"So long--\"    \"So long,\" replied the sheriff, wondering what sort of a man he had been  entertaining.    The door closed softly and soon after a joyous whoop floated in from  the Street. The sheriff toyed with the new gun and listened to the low  caress of a distant guitar.    \"Well, don't that beat all?\" He ejaculated.        CHAPTER IX. The Advent of McAllister      The blazing sun shone pitilessly on an arid plain which was spotted  with dust-gray clumps of mesquite and thorny chaparral. Basking in the  burning sand and alkali lay several Gila monsters, which raised their  heads and hissed with wide-open jaws as several faint, whip-like reports  echoed flatly over the desolate plain, showing that even they had  learned that danger was associated with such sounds.    Off to the north there became visible a cloud of dust and at intervals  something swayed in it, something that rose and fell and then became  hidden again. Out of that cloud came sharp, splitting sounds, which were  faintly responded to by another and larger cloud in its rear. As it came  nearer and finally swept past, the Gilas, to their terror, saw a madly  pounding horse, and it carried a man. The latter turned in his saddle  and raised a gun to his shoulder and the thunder that issued from it  caused the creeping audience to throw up their tails in sudden panic and  bury themselves out of sight in the sand.    The horse was only a broncho, its sides covered with hideous yellow  spots, and on its near flank was a peculiar scar, the brand. Foam  flecked from its crimsoned jaws and found a resting place on its sides  and on the hairy chaps of its rider. Sweat rolled and streamed from its  heaving flanks and was greedily sucked up by the drought-cursed alkali.  Close to the rider's knee a bloody furrow ran forward and one of the  broncho's ears was torn and limp. The broncho was doing its best--it  could run at that pace until it dropped dead. Every ounce of strength it  possessed was put forth to bring those hind hoofs well in front of  the forward ones and to send them pushing the sand behind in streaming  clouds. The horse had done this same thing many times--when would its  master learn sense?    The man was typical in appearance with many of that broad land. Lithe,  sinewy and bronzed by hard riding and hot suns, he sat in his Cheyenne  saddle like a centaur, all his weight on the heavy, leather-guarded  stirrups, his body rising in one magnificent straight line. A bleached  moustache hid the thin lips, and a gray sombrero threw a heavy shadow  across his eyes. Around his neck and over his open, blue flannel  shirt lay loosely a knotted silk kerchief, and on his thighs a pair of  open-flapped holsters swung uneasily with their ivory handled burdens.  He turned abruptly, raised his gun to his shoulder and fired, then  he laughed recklessly and patted his mount, which responded to  the confident caress by lying flatter to the earth in a spurt of  heart-breaking speed.    \"I'll show 'em who they're trailin'. This is th' second time I've  started for Muddy Wells, an' I'm goin' to "]]]
