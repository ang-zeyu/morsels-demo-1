They were the first  really accurate tables which navigators ever possessed; they were the  precursors of our present _Nautical Almanack_.    After this, the Grand Duke of Tuscany sent Kepler a golden chain, which  is interesting inasmuch as it must really have come from Galileo, who  was in high favour at the Italian Court at this time.    Once more Kepler made a determined attempt to get his arrears of salary  paid, and rescue himself and family from their bitter poverty. He  travelled to Prague on purpose, attended the imperial meeting, and  pleaded his own cause, but it was all fruitless; and exhausted by the  journey, weakened by over-study, and disheartened by the failure, he  caught a fever, and died in his fifty-ninth year. His body was buried at  Ratisbon, and a century ago a proposal was made to erect a marble  monument to his memory, but nothing was done. It matters little one way  or the other whether Germany, having almost refused him bread during his  life, should, a century and a half after his death, offer him a stone.    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Portrait of Kepler, older.]    The contiguity of the lives of Kepler and Tycho furnishes a moral too  obvious to need pointing out. What Kepler might have achieved had he  been relieved of those ghastly struggles for subsistence one cannot  tell, but this much is clear, that had Tycho been subjected to the same  misfortune, instead of being born rich and being assisted by generous  and enlightened patrons, he could have accomplished very little. His  instruments, his observatory--the tools by which he did his work--would  have been impossible for him. Frederick and Sophia of Denmark, and  Rudolph of Bohemia, are therefore to be remembered as co-workers with  him.    Kepler, with his ill-health and inferior physical energy, was unable to  command the like advantages. Much, nevertheless, he did; more one cannot  but feel he might have done had he been properly helped. Besides, the  world would have been free from the reproach of accepting the fruits of  his bright genius while condemning the worker to a life of misery,  relieved only by the beauty of his own thoughts and the ecstasy awakened  in him by the harmony and precision of Nature.    Concerning the method of Kepler, the mode by which he made his  discoveries, we must remember that he gives us an account of all the  steps, unsuccessful as well as successful, by which he travelled. He  maps out his route like a traveller. In fact he compares himself to  Columbus or Magellan, voyaging into unknown lands, and recording his  wandering route. This being remembered, it will be found that his  methods do not differ so utterly from those used by other philosophers  in like case. His imagination was perhaps more luxuriant and was allowed  freer play than most men's, but it was nevertheless always controlled by  rigid examination and comparison of hypotheses with fact.    Brewster says of him:--\"Ardent, restless, burning to distinguish  himself by discovery, he attempted everything; and once having obtained  a glimpse of a clue, no labour was too hard in following or verifying  it. A few of his attempts succeeded--a multitude failed. Those which  failed seem to us now fanciful, those which succeeded appear to us  sublime. But his methods were the same. When in search of what really  existed he sometimes found it; when in pursuit of a chimaera he could not  but fail; but in either case he displayed the same great qualities, and  that obstinate perseverance which must conquer all difficulties except  those really insurmountable.\"    To realize what he did for astronomy, it is necessary for us now to  consider some science still in its infancy. Astronomy is so clear and so  thoroughly explored now, that it is difficult to put oneself into a  contemporary attitude. But take some other science still barely  developed: meteorology, for instance. The science of the weather, the  succession of winds and rain, sunshine and frost, clouds and fog, is now  very much in the condition of astronomy before Kepler.    We have passed through the stage of ascribing atmospheric  disturbances--thunderstorms, cyclones, earthquakes, and the like--to  supernatural agency; we have had our Copernican era: not perhaps brought  about by a single individual, but still achieved. Something of the laws  of cyclone and anticyclone are known, and rude weather predictions  across the Atlantic are roughly possible. Barometers and thermometers  and anemometers, and all their tribe, represent the astronomical  instruments in the island of Huen; and our numerous meteorological  observatories, with their continual record of events, represent the work  of Tycho Brahe.    Observation is heaped on observation; tables are compiled; volumes are  filled with data; the hours of sunshine are recorded, the fall of rain,  the moisture in the air, the kind of clouds, the temperature--millions  of facts; but where is the Kepler to study and brood over them? Where  is the man to spend his life in evolving the beginnings of law and order  from the midst of all this chaos?    Perhaps as a man he may not come, but his era will come. Through this  stage the science must pass, ere it is ready for the commanding  intellect of a Newton.    But what a work it will be for the man, whoever he be that undertakes  it--a fearful monotonous grind of calculation, hypothesis, hypothesis,  calculation, a desperate and groping endeavour to reconcile theories  with facts.    A life of such labour, crowned by three brilliant discoveries, the world  owes (and too late recognizes its obligation) to the harshly treated  German genius, Kepler.          SUMMARY OF FACTS FOR LECTURES IV AND V      In 1564, Michael Angelo died and Galileo was born; in 1642, Galileo died  and Newton was born. Milton lived from 1608 to 1674.    For teaching the plurality of worlds, with other heterodox doctrines,  and refusing to recant, Bruno, after six years' imprisonment in Rome,  was burnt at the stake on the 16th of February, 1600 A.D. A \"natural\"  death in the dungeons of the Inquisition saved Antonio de Dominis, the  explainer of the rainbow, from the same fate, but his body and books  were publicly burned at Rome in 1624.    The persecution of Galileo began in 1615, became intense in 1632, and so  lasted till his death and after.    *      *      *      *      *    Galileo Galilei, eldest son of Vincenzo de Bonajuti de Galilei, a noble  Florentine, was born at Pisa, 18th of February, 1564. At the age of 17  was sent to the University of Pisa to study medicine. Observed the swing  of a pendulum and applied it to count pulse-beats. Read Euclid and  Archimedes, and could be kept at medicine no more. At 26 was appointed  Lecturer in Mathematics at Pisa. Read Bruno and became smitten with the  Copernican theory. Controverted the Aristotelians concerning falling  bodies, at Pisa. Hence became unpopular and accepted a chair at Padua,  1592. Invented a thermometer. Wrote on astronomy, adopting the Ptolemaic  system provisionally, and so opened up a correspondence with Kepler,  with whom he formed a friendship. Lectured on the new star of 1604, and  publicly renounced the old systems of astronomy. Invented a calculating  compass or \"Gunter's scale.\" In 1609 invented a telescope, after hearing  of a Dutch optician's discovery. Invented the microscope soon after.  Rapidly completed a better telescope and began a survey of the heavens.  On the 8th of January, 1610, discovered Jupiter's satellites. Observed  the mountains in the moon, and roughly measured their height. Explained  the visibility of the new moon by _earth-shine_. Was invited to the  Grand Ducal Court of Tuscany by Cosmo de Medici, and appointed  philosopher to that personage. Discovered innumerable new stars, and the  nebulae. Observed a triple appearance of Saturn. Discovered the phases  of Venus predicted by Copernicus, and spots on the sun. Wrote on  floating bodies. Tried to get his satellites utilized for determining  longitude at sea.    Went to Rome to defend the Copernican system, then under official  discussion, and as a result was formally forbidden ever to teach it. On  the accession of Pope Urban VIII. in 1623, Galileo again visited Rome to  pay his respects, and was well received. In 1632 appeared his  \"Dialogues\" on the Ptolemaic and Copernican systems. Summoned to Rome,  practically imprisoned, and \"rigorously questioned.\" Was made to recant  22nd of June, 1633. Forbidden evermore to publish anything, or to teach,  or receive friends. Retired to Arcetri in broken down health. Death of  his favourite daughter, Sister Maria Celeste. Wrote and meditated on the  laws of motion. Discovered the moon's libration. In 1637 he became  blind. The rigour was then slightly relaxed and many visited him: among  them John Milton. Died 8th of January, 1642, aged 78. As a prisoner of  the Inquisition his right to make a will or to be buried in consecrated  ground was disputed. Many of his manuscripts were destroyed.    Galileo, besides being a singularly clear-headed thinker and  experimental genius, was also something of a musician, a poet, and an  artist. He was full of humour as well as of solid common-sense, and his  literary style is brilliant. Of his scientific achievements those now  reckoned most weighty, are the discovery of the Laws of Motion, and the  laying of the foundations of Mechanics.    _Particulars of Jupiter's Satellites,  Illustrating their obedience to Kepler's third law._    --------------------------------------------------------------------------            |       |            |  Distance|         |         |   T^2            |       |  Time of   |    from  |         |         |   ----  Satellite.|Diameter revolution | Jupiter, |  T^2    |  d^3    |   d^3            | miles.|  in hours. |in Jovian |         |         | which is            | miles |   (T)      |   radii. |         |   "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28617"],[0,"Astounding Stories of Super-Science February 1930 (#13)"],[1,"n!\"    Tears were streaming down his face. \"His buddies,\" Riley had said. And  this was Riley, driving swiftly in, alone, to avenge them....    He saw dimly as the swift plane sped over the first bulb, on and over  the second. The soft roar of gas from the machines drowned the sound of  his engine. The plane passed them in silence to bank sharply toward the  third corner of the forming square.    He was looking them over, Thurston thought. And the damn beasts  disregarded so contemptible an opponent. He could still leave. \"For  God's sake, Riley, beat it--escape!\"    Thurston's mind was solely on the fate of the lone voyager--until the  impossible was borne in upon him.    The square was disrupted. Three great bulbs were now drifting. The wind  was carrying them out toward the bay. They were coming down in a long,  smooth descent. The plane shot like a winged rocket at the fourth great,  shining ball. To the watcher, aghast with sudden hope, it seemed barely  to crawl.    \"The ray! The ray....\" Thurston saw as if straining eyes had pierced  through the distance to see the invisible. He saw from below the swift  plane, the streaming, intangible ray. That was why Riley had flown  closely past and above them--the ray poured from below. His throat was  choking him, strangling....           *       *       *       *       *    The last enemy took alarm. Had it seen the slow sinking of its  companions, failed to hear them in reply to his mental call? The shining  pear shape shot violently upward; the attacking plane rolled to a  vertical bank as it missed the threatening clouds of exhaust. \"What do  you know about dog-fights?\" And Riley had grinned ... Riley belonged!    The bulb swelled before Thurston's eyes in its swift descent. It canted  to one side to head off the struggling plane that could never escape,  did not try to escape. The steady wings held true upon their straight  course. From above came the silver meteor; it seemed striking at the  very plane itself. It was almost upon it before it belched forth the  cushioning blast of gas.    Through the forming clouds a plane bored in swiftly. It rolled slowly,  was flying upside down. It was under the enemy! Its ray.... Thurston was  thrown a score of feet away to crash helpless into the stone coping by  the thunderous crash of the explosion.    There were fragments falling from a dense cloud--fragments of curved and  silvery metal ... the wing of a plane danced and fluttered in the  air....    \"He fired its bombs,\" whispered Thurston in a shaking voice. \"He killed  the other devils where they lay--he destroyed this with its own  explosive. He flew upside down to shoot up with the ray, to set off its  shells....\"    His mind was fumbling with the miracle of it. \"Clever pilot, Riley, in a  dog-fight....\" And then he realized.    Cyrus Thurston, millionaire sportsman, sank slowly, numbly to the roof  of the Equitable Building that still stood. And New York was still there  ... and the whole world....    He sobbed weakly, brokenly. Through his dazed brain flashed a sudden,  mind-saving thought. He laughed foolishly through his sobs.    \"And you said he'd die horribly, Mac, a horrible death.\" His head  dropped upon his arms, unconscious--and safe--with the rest of  humanity.           *       *       *       *       *          The Corpse on the Grating    _By Hugh B. Cave_          In the gloomy depths of the old warehouse Dale saw a thing that      drew a scream of horror to his dry lips. It was a corpse--the      mold of decay on its long-dead features--and yet it was alive!    [Illustration: _It was a corpse, standing before me like some propped-up  thing from the grave._]      It was ten o'clock on the morning of December 5 when M. S. and I left  the study of Professor Daimler. You are perhaps acquainted with M. S.  His name appears constantly in the pages of the Illustrated News, in  conjunction with some very technical article on psycho-analysis or with  some extensive study of the human brain and its functions. He is a  psycho-fanatic, more or less, and has spent an entire lifetime of some  seventy-odd years in pulling apart human skulls for the purpose of  investigation. Lovely pursuit!    For some twenty years I have mocked him, in a friendly, half-hearted  fashion. I am a medical man, and my own profession is one that does not  sympathize with radicals.    As for Professor Daimler, the third member of our triangle--perhaps, if  I take a moment to outline the events of that evening, the Professor's  part in what follows will be less obscure. We had called on him, M. S.  and I, at his urgent request. His rooms were in a narrow, unlighted  street just off the square, and Daimler himself opened the door to us. A  tall, loosely built chap he was, standing in the doorway like a  motionless ape, arms half extended.    \"I've summoned you, gentlemen,\" he said quietly, \"because you two, of  all London, are the only persons who know the nature of my recent  experiments. I should like to acquaint you with the results!\"    He led the way to his study, then kicked the door shut with his foot,  seizing my arm as he did so. Quietly he dragged me to the table that  stood against the farther wall. In the same even, unemotional tone of a  man completely sure of himself, he commanded me to inspect it.    For a moment, in the semi-gloom of the room, I saw nothing. At length,  however, the contents of the table revealed themselves, and I  distinguished a motley collection of test tubes, each filled with some  fluid. The tubes were attached to each other by some ingenious  arrangement of thistles, and at the end of the table, where a chance  blow could not brush it aside, lay a tiny phial of the resulting serum.  From the appearance of the table, Daimler had evidently drawn a certain  amount of gas from each of the smaller tubes, distilling them through  acid into the minute phial at the end. Yet even now, as I stared down at  the fantastic paraphernalia before me, I could sense no conclusive  reason for its existence.    I turned to the Professor with a quiet stare of bewilderment. He smiled.    \"The experiment is over,\" he said. \"As to its conclusion, you, Dale, as  a medical man, will be sceptical. And you\"--turning to M. S.--\"as a  scientist you will be amazed. I, being neither physician nor scientist,  am merely filled with wonder!\"           *       *       *       *       *    He stepped to a long, square table-like structure in the center of the  room. Standing over it, he glanced quizzically at M. S., then at me.    \"For a period of two weeks,\" he went on, \"I have kept, on the table  here, the body of a man who has been dead more than a month. I have  tried, gentlemen, with acid combinations of my own origination, to bring  that body back to life. And ... I have--failed!    \"But,\" he added quickly, noting the smile that crept across my face,  \"that failure was in itself worth more than the average scientist's  greatest achievement! You know, Dale, that heat, if a man is not truly  dead, will sometimes resurrect him. In a case of epilepsy, for instance,  victims have been pronounced dead only to return to life--sometimes in  the grave.    \"I say 'if a man be not truly dead.' But what if that man _is_ truly  dead? Does the cure alter itself in any manner? The motor of your car  dies--do you bury it? You do not; you locate the faulty part, correct  it, and infuse new life. And so, gentlemen, after remedying the ruptured  heart of this dead man, by operation, I proceeded to bring him back to  life.    \"I used heat. Terrific heat will sometimes originate a spark of new life  in something long dead. Gentlemen, on the fourth day of my tests,  following a continued application of electric and acid heat, the  patient--\"    Daimler leaned over the table and took up a cigarette. Lighting it, he  dropped the match and resumed his monologue.    \"The patient turned suddenly over and drew his arm weakly across his  eyes. I rushed to his side. When I reached him, the body was once again  stiff and lifeless. And--it has remained so.\"    The Professor stared at us quietly, waiting for comment. I answered him,  as carelessly as I could, with a shrug of my shoulders.    \"Professor, have you ever played with the dead body of a frog?\" I said  softly.           *       *       *       *       *    He shook his head silently.    \"You would find it interesting sport,\" I told him. \"Take a common dry  cell battery with enough voltage to render a sharp shock. Then apply  your wires to various parts of the frog's anatomy. If you are lucky, and  strike the right set of muscles, you will have the pleasure of seeing a  dead frog leap suddenly forward. Understand, he will not regain life.  You have merely released his dead muscles by shock, and sent him  bolting.\"    The Professor did not reply. I could feel his eyes on me, and had I  turned, I should probably had found M. S. glaring at me in honest hate.  These men were students of mesmerism, of spiritualism, and my  commonplace contradiction was not over welcome.    \"You are cynical, Dale,\" said M. S. coldly, \"because you do not  understand!\"    \"Understand? I am a doctor--not a ghost!\"    But M. S. had turned eagerly to the Professor.    \"Where is this body--this experiment?\" he demanded.    Daimler shook his head. Evidently he had acknowledged failure and did  not intend to drag his dead man before our eyes, unless he could bring  that man forth alive, upright, and ready to join our conversation!    \"I've put it away,\" he said distantly. \"There is nothing more to be  done, now that our reverend doctor has insisted in making a matter of  fact thing out of our experiment. You understand, I had not intended to  go in for wholesale resurrection, even if I had met with success. It was  my belief that a dead body, like a dead piece of mechanism, can be  brought to life again, provided we are intelligent enough to discover  the secret. And by God, it"]]]
