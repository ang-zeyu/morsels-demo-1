By threats  of instant death, and by the offers of a high reward, they succeeded in  persuading two Saxon prisoners to act as spies, and one day these  brought in to Haffa the news that the band had that morning, after  striking a successful blow at the Danes ten miles away, entered at  daybreak a wood but three miles from his camp.    The Northman, disdaining to ask for assistance from one of the other  bands against so small a foe, moved out at once with 300 of his men  towards the wood. The Saxons had posted guards, who on the approach of  the Danes roused Edmund with the news that the enemy were close at  hand. The Saxons were soon on their feet.    \"Now, my friends,\" Edmund said to them, \"here is the time for trying  what benefit we have got from our exercise. We cannot well draw off,  for the Danes are as fleet-footed as we; therefore let us fight and  conquer them.\"    The men formed up cheerfully, and the little body moved out from the  wood to meet the Danes. The latter gave a shout of triumph as they saw  them. The Saxon force, from its compact formation, appeared even  smaller than it was, and the Norsemen advanced in haste, each eager to  be the first to fall upon an enemy whom they regarded as an easy prey.  As they arrived upon the spot, however, and saw the thick hedge of  spears which bristled round the little body of Saxons, the first comers  checked their speed and waited till Haffa himself came up, accompanied  by his principal warriors.    Without a moment's hesitation the jarl flung himself upon the Saxons.  In vain, however, he tried to reach them with his long sword. As he  neared them the front line of the Saxons dropped on one knee, and as  the Danes with their shields dashed against the spears and strove to  cut through them, the kneeling men were able with their pikes to thrust  at the unguarded portions of the bodies below their shields, and many  fell grievously wounded. After trying for some time in vain, Haffa,  finding that individual effort did not suffice to break through the  Saxon spears, formed his men up in line four deep, and advanced in a  solid body so as to overwhelm them.    The Saxons now rose to their feet. The spears, instead of being pointed  outwards, were inclined towards the front, and the wedge advanced  against the Danes. The Saxon war cry rose loud as they neared the  Danish line, and then, still maintaining their close formation, they  charged upon it. The assault was irresistible. The whole weight was  thrown upon a point, and preceded, as it was, by the densely-packed  spears, it burst through the Danish line as if the latter had been  composed of osier twigs, bearing down all in its way.    With shouts of surprise the Danes broke up their line and closed in a  thick mass round the Saxons, those behind pressing forward and impeding  the motions of the warriors actually engaged. The Saxons no longer kept  stationary. In obedience to Edmund's orders the triangle advanced,  sometimes with one angle in front, sometimes with another, but  whichever way it moved sweeping away the Danes opposed to it, while the  archers from the centre shot fast and strong into the mass of the enemy.    Haffa himself, trying to oppose the advance of the wedge, was slain by  a blow of Egbert's axe, and after half an hour's fierce fighting, the  Danes, having lost upwards of fifty of their best men, and finding all  their efforts to produce an impression upon the Saxons vain, desisted  from the attack and fled.    At once the wedge broke up, and the Saxons followed in hot pursuit,  cutting down their flying enemies. Obedient, however, to Edmund's  repeated shouts they kept fairly together, and when the Danes, thinking  them broken and disordered, turned to fall upon them, a single note of  the horn brought them instantly together again, and the astonished  Danes saw the phalanx which had proved so fatal to them prepared to  receive their attack. This they did not attempt to deliver, but took to  flight, the Saxons, as before, pursuing, and twice as many of the Danes  were slain in the retreat as in the first attack.    The pursuit was continued for many miles, and then, fearing that he  might come across some fresh body of the enemy, Edmund called off his  men. Great was the triumph of the Saxons. A few of them had suffered  from wounds more or less serious, but not one had fallen. They had  defeated a body of Danes four times their own force, and had killed  nearly half of them, and they felt confident that the tactics which  they had adopted would enable them in future to defeat any scattered  bodies of Danes they might meet.    For a week after the battle they rested, spending their time in further  improving themselves in their drill, practicing especially the  alterations of the position of the spears requisite when changing from  a defensive attitude, with the pikes at right angles to each face, to  that of an attack, when the spears of both faces of the advancing wedge  were all directed forward. A messenger arrived from the king, to whom  Edmund had sent the news of his various successes, and Alfred sent his  warmest congratulations and thanks for the great results which had been  gained with so small a force, the king confessing that he was unable to  understand how with such disproportionate numbers Edmund could so  totally have routed the force of so distinguished a leader as Haffa.    For some weeks Edmund continued the work of checking the depredations  of the Danes, and so successful was he that the freebooters became  seized with a superstitious awe of his band. The rapidity of its  maneuvering, the manner in which men, at one moment scattered, were in  another formed in a serried mass, against which all their efforts broke  as waves against a rock, seemed to them to be something superhuman. In  that part of Wessex, therefore, the invaders gradually withdrew their  forces across the frontier; but in other parts of the country, the tide  of invasion being unchecked, large tracts of country had been  devastated, and the West Saxons could nowhere make head against them.  One day a messenger reached Edmund telling him that a large Danish army  was approaching Sherborne, and urging him to return instantly to the  defence of his earldom.    With rapid marches he proceeded thither, and on arriving at his house  he found that the Danes were but a few miles away, and that the whole  country was in a state of panic. He at once sent off messengers in all  directions, bidding the people hasten with their wives and families,  their herds and valuables, to the fort. His return to some extent  restored confidence. The news of the victories he had gained over the  Danes had reached Sherborne, and the confidence of their power to  defeat the invaders which his followers expressed as they scattered to  their respective farms again raised the courage of the people.    All through the night bands of fugitives poured into the fort, and by  morning the whole of the people for many miles round were assembled  there. Egbert and Edmund busied themselves in assigning to each his  duty and station. All the men capable of bearing arms were told off to  posts on the walls. The old men and young boys were to draw water and  look after the cattle; the women to cook and attend to the wounded. The  men of his own band were not placed upon the walls, but were held in  readiness as a reserve to move to any point which might be threatened,  and to take part in sorties against the enemy.    Soon smoke was seen rising up in many directions, showing that the  enemy were at their accustomed work. Cries broke from the women, and  exclamations of rage from the men, as they recognized by the direction  of the smoke that their own homesteads and villages were in the hands  of the spoilers. About mid-day a party of mounted Danes rode up towards  the fort and made a circuit of it. When they had satisfied themselves  as to the formidable nature of its defences they rode off again, and  for the rest of the day none of the enemy approached the fort.          CHAPTER VI: THE SAXON FORT      A strict watch was kept all night, and several scouts were sent out.  These on their return reported that the Danes were feasting, having  slain many cattle and broached the casks of mead which they found in  the cellars of Edmund's house. This they had not burned nor the houses  around it, intending, as the scouts supposed, to make it their  headquarters while they attacked the fort.    Edmund and Egbert agreed that it would be well to show the Danes at  once that they had an active and enterprising foe to deal with; they  therefore awakened their band, who were sleeping on skins close to the  gate, and with them started out.    It was still two hours before dawn when they approached the house. Save  a few men on watch, the great Danish host, which the messengers  calculated to amount to ten thousand men, were asleep. Cautiously  making their way so as to avoid stumbling over the Danes, who lay  scattered in groups round the house, the Saxons crept forward quietly  until close to the entrance, when a sleepy watchman started up.    \"Who are ye?\"    The answer was a blow from Egbert's battle-axe. Then the leaders with  twenty of their men rushed into the house, while the rest remained on  guard at the entrance.    The combat was short but furious, and the clashing of arms and shouts  of the Danes roused those sleeping near, and the men who escaped from  the house spread the alarm. The fight lasted but three or four minutes,  for the Danes, scattered through the house, and in many cases still  stupid from the effects of the previous night's debauch, were unable to  gather and make any collective resistance. The two jarls fought in a  manner worthy of their renown, but the Saxon spears proved more than a  match for their swords, and they died fighting bravely till the last.  Between Saxon and Dane there was no"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36764"],[0,"In the Track of the Bookworm (#13)"],[1,"'seriously mutilated by worms'; wherever therefore an hiatus occurs, the  charitable and cultured mind will be enabled to conclude that (as in the  case of a second descent upon a ball supper) the 'best things' have been  already devoured.\" It was doubtless to guard against thieves that the  ancient books were chained up in the monasteries, but the practice was  effectual also against borrowers. De Bury, in his \"Philobiblon\" has a  chapter entitled \"A Provident Arrangement by which his Books may be lent  to Strangers,\" in which the utmost leniency is to lend duplicate books  upon ample security. Not to adopt the harsh judgment of an ancient  author, who says, \"to lend a book is to lose it, and borrowing but a  hypocritical pretense for stealing,\" we may conclude, in a word, that to  lend a book is like the Presidency of the United States, to be neither  desired nor refused. Collectors are not so much exposed to the ravages of  thieves as book-sellers are, and a book-thief ought to be regarded with  leniency for his good taste and his reliance on the existence of culture  in others. After all, it is one's own fault if he lends a book. One  should as soon think of lending one of his children, unless he has  duplicate or triplicate daughters. It would be difficult to foretell what  would happen to a man who should propose to borrow a rare book. Perhaps  death by freezing would be the safest prediction. Although Grolier stamped  \"et amicorum\" on his books, that did not mean that he would lend them, but  only that his friends were free of them at his house. It is amusing to  note, in Mr. Castle's monograph on Book-Plates, how many of them indicate  a stern purpose not to lend books. Mr. Gosse regards book-plates as a  precaution not only against thieves, but against borrowers. He observes of  the man who does not adopt a book-plate: \"Such a man is liable to great  temptations. He is brought face to face with that enemy of his species,  the borrower, and does not speak with him in the gate. If he had a  book-plate he would say, 'Oh! certainly I will lend you this volume, if it  has not my book-plate in it; of course one makes it a rule never to lend  a book that has.' He would say this and feign to look inside the volume,  knowing right well that this safeguard against the borrower is there  already.\" One may make a gift of a book to a friend, but there is as much  difference between giving a book and lending one as there is between  indorsing a note and giving the money. I have considerable respect for and  sympathy with a good honest book-thief. He holds out no false hopes and  makes no false pretences. But the borrower who does not return adds  hypocrisy and false pretences to other crime. He ought to be committed to  the State prison for life, and put at keeping the books of the  institution. In a buried temple in Cnidos, in 1857, Mr. Newton found rolls  of lead hung up, on which were inscribed spells devoting enemies to the  infernal gods for sundry specified offenses, among which was the failure  to return a borrowed garment. On which Agnes Repplier says: \"Would that  it were given to me now to inscribe, and by inscribing doom, all those who  have borrowed and failed to return our books; would that by scribbling  some strong language on a piece of lead we could avenge the lamentable  gaps on our shelves, and send the ghosts of the wrong-doers howling  dismally into the eternal shades of Tartarus.\"    I have spoken of a certain amount of sympathy as due from a magnanimous  book-owner toward a pilferer of such wares. This is always on the  condition that he steals to add to his own hoard and not for mere  pecuniary gain. The following is suggested as a Christian mode of dealing  with      THE BOOK-THIEF.          Ah, gentle thief!    I marked the absent-minded air    With which you tucked away my rare        Book in your pocket.          'Twas past belief--    I saw you near the open case,    But yours was such an honest face        I did not lock it.          I knew you lacked    That one to make your set complete,    And when that book you chanced to meet        You recognized it.          And when attacked    By rage of bibliophilic greed,    You prigged that small Quantin Ovide,        Although I prized it.          I will not sue,    Nor bring your family to shame    By giving up your honored name        To heartless prattle.          I'll visit you,    And under your unwary eyes    Secrete and carry off the prize,        My ravished chattel.    It greatly rejoices me to observe that Mr. Blades does not include tobacco  among the enemies of books. In one sense tobacco may be ranked as a  book-enemy, for self-denial in this regard may furnish a man with a good  library in a few years. I have known a very pretty collection made out of  the ordinary smoke-offerings of twenty years. Undoubtedly there are  libraries so fine that smoking in them would be discountenanced, but mine  is not impervious to the pipe or cigar, and I entertain the pleasing fancy  that tobacco-smoke is good for books, disinfects them, and keeps them free  from the destroying worm. As I do not myself smoke, I like to see my  friends taking their ease in my book-room, with the \"smoke of their  torment ascending\" above my modest volumes. I know how they feel, without  incurring the expense, and so to them I indite and dedicate      THE SMOKE TRAVELLER.      When I puff my cigarette,        Straight I see a Spanish girl,        Mantilla, fan, coquettish curl,        Languid airs and dimpled face,        Calculating fatal grace;        Hear a twittering serenade        Under lofty balcony played;        Queen at bull-fight, naught she cares        What her agile lover dares;    She can love and quick forget.      Let me but my meerschaum light,        I behold a bearded man,        Built upon capacious plan,        Sabre-slashed in war or duel,        Gruff of aspect but not cruel,        Metaphysically muddled,        With strong beer a little fuddled,        Slow in love and deep in books,        More sentimental than he looks,    Swears new friendships every night.      Let me my chibouk enkindle,--        In a tent I'm quick set down        With a Bedouin lean and brown,        Plotting gain of merchandise,        Or perchance of robber prize;        Clumsy camel load upheaving,        Woman deftly carpet weaving;        Meal of dates and bread and salt,        While in azure heavenly vault    Throbbing stars begin to dwindle.      Glowing coal in clay dudheen        Carries me to sweet Killarney,        Full of hypocritic blarney;        Huts with babies, pigs and hens        Mixed together; bogs and fens;        Shillalahs, praties, usquebaugh,        Tenants defying hated law,        Fair blue eyes with lashes black,        Eyes black and blue from cudgel-thwack,--    So fair, so foul, is Erin green.      My nargileh once inflamed,        Quick appears a Turk with turban,        Girt with guards in palace urban,        Or in house by summer sea        Slave-girls dancing languidly;        Bow-string, sack and bastinado,        Black boats darting in the shadow;        Let things happen as they please,        Whether well or ill at ease,    Fate alone is blessed or blamed.      With my ancient calumet        I can raise a wigwam's smoke,        And the copper tribe invoke,--        Scalps and wampum, bows and knives,        Slender maidens, greasy wives,        Papoose hanging on a tree,        Chieftains squatting silently,        Feathers, beads and hideous paint,        Medicine-man and wooden saint,--    Forest-framed the vision set.      My cigar breeds many forms--        Planter of the rich Havana,        Mopping brow with sheer bandanna;        Russian prince in fur arrayed;        Paris fop on dress parade;        London swell just after dinner;        Wall Street broker--gambling sinner;        Delver in Nevada mine;        Scotch laird bawling \"Auld Lang Syne;\"    Thus Raleigh's weed my fancy warms.      Life's review in smoke goes past.        Fickle fortune, stubborn fate,        Right discovered all too late,        Beings loved and gone before,        Beings loved but friends no more,        Self-reproach and futile sighs,        Vanity in birth that dies,        Longing, heart-break, adoration,--        Nothing sure in expectation    Save ash-receiver at the last.    In the early history of New England, when the town of Deerfield was burned  by the Indians, Captain Dunstan, who was the father of a large family,  deeming discretion the better part of valor, made up his mind to run for  it and to take one child (as a sample, probably), that being all he could  safely carry on his horse. But on looking about him, he could not  determine which child to take, and so observing to his wife, \"All or  none,\" he set her and the baby on the horse, and brought up the rear on  foot with his gun, and fended off the redskins and brought the whole  family into safety. Such is the tale, and in the old primer there was a  picture of the scene--although I do not understand that it was taken from  the life, and the story reflects small credit on the character of the  aborigines for enterprise.    I have often conjectured which of my books I would save in case of fire in  my library, and whether I should care to rescue any if I could not bring  off all. Perhaps the problem would work itself out as follows:      THE FIRE IN THE LIBRARY.      Twas just before midnight a smart conflagration      Broke out in my dwelling and threatened my books;    Confounded and dazed with a great consternation      I gazed at my treasures with pitiful looks.      \"Oh! which shall I rescue?\" I cried in deep feeling;      I wished I were armed like Briareus of yore,    While sharper and sharper the flames kept revealing      The sight of my bibliographical store.      \"My Lamb may remain to be thoroughly roasted,      My Crabbe to be broiled and my Bacon to "]]]
