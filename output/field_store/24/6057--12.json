The young Meloe-larvae established in the down of the Anthophorae or  in that of the Melecta- and the Coelioxys-bees, their parasites, had  adopted an infallible means of sooner or later reaching the desired  cell. Was it, so far as they were concerned, a choice dictated by the  foresight of instinct, or just simply the result of a lucky chance?  The question was soon decided. Various Flies--Drone-flies and  Bluebottles (_Eristalis tenax_ and _Calliphora vomitoria_)--would  settle from time to time on the groundsel- or camomile-flowers  occupied by the young Meloes and stop for a moment to suck the sweet  secretions. On all these Flies, with very few exceptions, I found  Meloe-larvae, motionless in the silky down of the thorax. I may also  mention, as infested by these larvae, an Ammophila (_A. hirsuta_),[5]  who victuals her burrows with a caterpillar in early spring, while her  kinswomen build their nests in autumn. This Wasp merely grazes, so to  speak, the surface of a flower; I catch her; there are Meloes moving  about her body. It is clear that neither the Drone-flies nor the  Bluebottles, whose larvae live in putrefying matter, nor yet the  Ammophilae who victual theirs with caterpillars, could ever have  carried the larvae which invaded them into cells filled with honey.  These larvae therefore had gone astray; and instinct, as does not  often happen, was here at fault.    [Footnote 5: For the Wasp known as the Hairy Ammophila, who feeds her  young on the Grey Worm, the caterpillar of the Turnip Moth, cf. _The  Hunting Wasps_, chaps. xviii. to xx.--_Translator's Note_.]    Let us now turn our attention to the young Meloes waiting expectant  upon the camomile-flowers. There they are, ten, fifteen or more,  lodged half-way down the florets of a single blossom or in their  interstices; it therefore needs a certain degree of scrutiny to  perceive them, their hiding-place being the more effectual in that the  amber colour of their bodies merges in the yellow hue of the florets.  So long as nothing unusual happens upon the flower, so long as no  sudden shock announces the arrival of a strange visitor, the Meloes  remain absolutely motionless and give no sign of life. To see them  dipping vertically, head downwards, into the florets, one might  suppose that they were seeking some sweet liquid, their food; but in  that case they ought to pass more frequently from one floret to  another, which they do not, except when, after a false alarm, they  regain their hiding-places and choose the spot which seems to them the  most favourable. This immobility means that the florets of the  camomile serve them only as a place of ambush, even as later the  Anthophora's body will serve them solely as a vehicle to convey them  to the Bee's cell. They take no nourishment, either on the flowers or  on the Bees; and, as with the Sitares, their first meal will consist  of the Anthophora's egg, which the hooks of their mandibles are  intended to rip open.    Their immobility is, as we have said, complete; but nothing is easier  than to arouse their suspended activity. Shake a camomile-blossom  lightly with a bit of straw: instantly the Meloes leave their  hiding-places, come up and scatter in all directions on the white  petals of the circumference, running over them from one end to the  other with all the speed which the smallness of their size permits. On  reaching the extreme end of the petals, they fasten to it either with  their caudal appendages, or perhaps with a sticky substance similar to  that furnished by the anal button of the Sitares; and, with their  bodies hanging outside and their six legs free, they bend about in  every direction and stretch as far out as they can, as though striving  to touch an object out of their reach. If nothing offers for them to  seize upon, after a few vain attempts they regain the centre of the  flower and soon resume their immobility.    But, if we place near them any object whatever, they do not fail to  catch on to it with surprising agility. A blade of grass, a bit of  straw, the handle of my tweezers which I hold out to them: they accept  anything in their eagerness to quit the provisional shelter of the  flower. It is true that, after finding themselves on these inanimate  objects, they soon recognize that they have gone astray, as we see by  their bustling movements to and fro and their tendency to go back to  the flower if there still be time. Those which have thus giddily flung  themselves upon a bit of straw and are allowed to return to their  flower do not readily fall a second time into the same trap. There is  therefore, in these animated specks, a memory, an experience of  things.    After these experiments I tried others with hairy materials imitating  more or less closely the down of the Bees, with little pieces of cloth  or velvet cut from my clothes, with plugs of cotton wool, with pellets  of flock gathered from the everlastings. Upon all these objects,  offered with the tweezers, the Meloes flung themselves without any  difficulty; but, instead of keeping quiet, as they do on the bodies of  the Bees, they soon convinced me, by their restless behaviour, that  they found themselves as much out of their element on these furry  materials as on the smooth surface of a bit of straw. I ought to have  expected this: had I not just seen them wandering without pause upon  the everlastings enveloped with cottony flock? If reaching the shelter  of a downy surface were enough to make them believe themselves safe in  harbour, nearly all would perish, without further attempts, in the  down of the plants.    Let us now offer them live insects and, first of all, Anthophorae. If  the Bee, after we have rid her of the parasites which she may be  carrying, be taken by the wings and held for a moment in contact with  the flower, we invariably find her, after this rapid contact, overrun  by Meloes clinging to her hairs. The larvae nimbly take up their  position on the thorax, usually on the shoulders or sides, and once  there they remain motionless: the second stage of their strange  journey is compassed.    After the Anthophorae, I tried the first live insects that I was able  to procure at once: Drone-flies, Bluebottles, Hive-bees, small  Butterflies. All were alike overrun by the Meloes, without hesitation.  What is more, there was no attempt made to return to the flowers. As I  could not find any Beetles at the moment, I was unable to experiment  with them. Newport, experimenting, it is true, under conditions very  different from mine, since his observations related to young Meloes  held captive in a glass jar, while mine were made in the normal  circumstances, Newport, I was saying, saw Meloes fasten to the body of  a Malachius and stay there without moving, which inclines me to  believe that with Beetles I should have obtained the same results as,  for instance, with a Drone-fly. And I did, in fact, at a later date,  find some Meloe-larvae on the body of a big Beetle, the Golden  Rose-chafer (_Cetonia aurata_), an assiduous visitor of the flowers.    After exhausting the insect class, I put within their reach my last  resource, a large black Spider. Without hesitation they passed from  the flower to the arachnid, made for places near the joints of the  legs and settled there without moving. Everything therefore seems to  suit their plans for leaving the provisional abode where they are  waiting; without distinction of species, genus, or class, they fasten  to the first living creature that chance brings within their reach. We  now understand how it is that these young larvae have been observed  upon a host of different insects and especially upon the early Flies  and Bees pillaging the flowers; we can also understand the need for  that prodigious number of eggs laid by a single Oil-beetle, since the  vast majority of the larvae which come out of them will infallibly go  astray and will not succeed in reaching the cells of the Anthophorae.  Instinct is at fault here; and fecundity makes up for it.    But instinct recovers its infallibility in another case. The Meloes,  as we have seen, pass without difficulty from the flower to the  objects within their reach, whatever these may be, smooth or hairy,  living or inanimate. This done, they behave very differently,  according as they have chanced to invade the body of an insect or some  other object. In the first case, on a downy Fly or Butterfly, on a  smooth-skinned Spider or Beetle, the larvae remain motionless after  reaching the point which suits them. Their instinctive desire is  therefore satisfied. In the second case, in the midst of the nap of  cloth or velvet, or the filaments of cotton, or the flock of the  everlasting, or, lastly, on the smooth surface of a leaf or a straw,  they betray the knowledge of their mistake by their continual coming  and going, by their efforts to return to the flower imprudently  abandoned.    How then do they recognize the nature of the object to which they have  just moved? How is it that this object, whatever the quality of its  surface, will sometimes suit them and sometimes not? Do they judge  their new lodging by sight? But then no mistake would be possible; the  sense of sight would tell them at the outset whether the object within  reach was suitable or not; and emigration would or would not take  place according to its decision. And then how can we suppose that,  buried in the dense thicket of a pellet of cotton-wool or in the  fleece of an Anthophora, the imperceptible larva can recognize, by  sight, the enormous mass which it is perambulating?    Is it by touch, by some sensation due to the inner vibrations of  living flesh? Not so, for the Meloes"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2788"],[0,"Little Men: Life at Plumfield With Jo's Boys (#13)"],[1,"ome. It is always well to have  something in the storeroom,\" said Aunt Jo, who had been taught this  valuable fact by a series of domestic panics.    \"Me is hundry,\" announced Teddy, who began to think what with so much  cooking going on it was about time for somebody to eat something. His  mother gave him her workbasket to rummage, hoping to keep him quiet till  dinner was ready, and returned to her housekeeping.    \"Put on your vegetables, set the table, and then have some coals  kindling ready for the steak.\"    What a thing it was to see the potatoes bobbing about in the little pot;  to peep at the squash getting soft so fast in the tiny steamer; to whisk  open the oven door every five minutes to see how the pies got on, and  at last when the coals were red and glowing, to put two real steaks on  a finger-long gridiron and proudly turn them with a fork. The potatoes  were done first, and no wonder, for they had boiled frantically all the  while. The were pounded up with a little pestle, had much butter and no  salt put in (cook forgot it in the excitement of the moment), then it  was made into a mound in a gay red dish, smoothed over with a knife  dipped in milk, and put in the oven to brown.    So absorbed in these last performances had Sally been, that she forgot  her pastry till she opened the door to put in the potato, then a wail  arose, for alas! alas! the little pies were burnt black!    \"Oh, my pies! My darling pies! They are all spoilt!\" cried poor Sally,  wringing her dirty little hands as she surveyed the ruin of her work.  The tart was especially pathetic, for the quirls and zigzags stuck up in  all directions from the blackened jelly, like the walls and chimney of a  house after a fire.    \"Dear, dear, I forgot to remind you to take them out; it's just my  luck,\" said Aunt Jo, remorsefully. \"Don't cry, darling, it was my fault;  we'll try again after dinner,\" she added, as a great tear dropped from  Sally's eyes and sizzled on the hot ruins of the tart.    More would have followed, if the steak had not blazed up just then,  and so occupied the attention of cook, that she quickly forgot the lost  pastry.    \"Put the meat-dish and your own plates down to warm, while you mash the  squash with butter, salt, and a little pepper on the top,\" said Mrs. Jo,  devoutly hoping that the dinner would meet with no further disasters.    The \"cunning pepper-pot\" soothed Sally's feelings, and she dished up her  squash in fine style. The dinner was safely put upon the table; the six  dolls were seated three on a side; Teddy took the bottom, and Sally the  top. When all were settled, it was a most imposing spectacle, for one  doll was in full ball costume, another in her night-gown; Jerry, the  worsted boy, wore his red winter suit, while Annabella, the noseless  darling, was airily attired in nothing but her own kid skin. Teddy, as  father of the family, behaved with great propriety, for he smilingly  devoured everything offered him, and did not find a single fault. Daisy  beamed upon her company like the weary, warm, but hospitable hostess so  often to be seen at larger tables than this, and did the honors with an  air of innocent satisfaction, which we do not often see elsewhere.    The steak was so tough that the little carving-knife would not cut it;  the potato did not go round, and the squash was very lumpy; but the  guests appeared politely unconscious of these trifles; and the master  and mistress of the house cleared the table with appetites that anyone  might envy them. The joy of skimming a jug-full of cream mitigated the  anguish felt for the loss of the pies, and Asia's despised cake proved a  treasure in the way of dessert.    \"That is the nicest lunch I ever had; can't I do it every day?\" asked  Daisy as she scraped up and ate the leavings all round.    \"You can cook things every day after lessons, but I prefer that you  should eat your dishes at your regular meals, and only have a bit of  gingerbread for lunch. To-day, being the first time, I don't mind, but  we must keep our rules. This afternoon you can make something for tea  if you like,\" said Mrs. Jo, who had enjoyed the dinner-party very much,  though no one had invited her to partake.    \"Do let me make flapjacks for Demi, he loves them so, and it's such fun  to turn them and put sugar in between,\" cried Daisy, tenderly wiping a  yellow stain off Annabella's broken nose, for Bella had refused to eat  squash when it was pressed upon her as good for \"lumatism,\" a complaint  which it is no wonder she suffered from, considering the lightness of  her attire.    \"But if you give Demi goodies, all the others will expect some also, and  then you will have your hands full.\"    \"Couldn't I have Demi come up to tea alone just this one time? And after  that I could cook things for the others if they were good,\" proposed  Daisy, with a sudden inspiration.    \"That is a capital idea, Posy! We will make your little messes rewards  for the good boys, and I don't know one among them who would not like  something nice to eat more than almost anything else. If little men are  like big ones, good cooking will touch their hearts and soothe their  tempers delightfully,\" added Aunt Jo, with a merry nod toward the  door, where stood Papa Bhaer, surveying the scene with a face full of  amusement.    \"That last hit was for me, sharp woman. I accept it, for it is true; but  if I had married thee for thy cooking, heart's dearest, I should have  fared badly all these years,\" answered the professor, laughing as he  tossed Teddy, who became quite apoplectic in his endeavors to describe  the feast he had just enjoyed.    Daisy proudly showed her kitchen, and rashly promised Uncle Fritz as  many flapjacks as he could eat. She was just telling about the new  rewards when the boys, headed by Demi, burst into the room snuffing the  air like a pack of hungry hounds, for school was out, dinner was not  ready, and the fragrance of Daisy's steak led them straight to the spot.    A prouder little damsel was never seen than Sally as she displayed her  treasures and told the lads what was in store for them. Several rather  scoffed at the idea of her cooking anything fit to eat, but Stuffy's  heart was won at once. Nat and Demi had firm faith in her skill, and the  others said they would wait and see. All admired the kitchen, however,  and examined the stove with deep interest. Demi offered to buy  the boiler on the spot, to be used in a steam-engine which he was  constructing; and Ned declared that the best and biggest saucepan was  just the thing to melt his lead in when he ran bullets, hatchets, and  such trifles.    Daisy looked so alarmed at these proposals, that Mrs. Jo then and  there made and proclaimed a law that no boy should touch, use, or  even approach the sacred stove without a special permit from the  owner thereof. This increased its value immensely in the eyes of the  gentlemen, especially as any infringement of the law would be punished  by forfeiture of all right to partake of the delicacies promised to the  virtuous.    At this point the bell rang, and the entire population went down to  dinner, which meal was enlivened by each of the boys giving Daisy a  list of things he would like to have cooked for him as fast as he  earned them. Daisy, whose faith in her stove was unlimited, promised  everything, if Aunt Jo would tell her how to make them. This suggestion  rather alarmed Mrs. Jo, for some of the dishes were quite beyond her  skill wedding-cake, for instance, bull's-eye candy; and cabbage soup  with herrings and cherries in it, which Mr. Bhaer proposed as his  favorite, and immediately reduced his wife to despair, for German  cookery was beyond her.    Daisy wanted to begin again the minute dinner was done, but she was only  allowed to clear up, fill the kettle ready for tea, and wash out her  apron, which looked as if she had a Christmas feast. She was then sent  out to play till five o'clock, for Uncle Fritz said that too much study,  even at cooking stoves, was bad for little minds and bodies, and Aunt Jo  knew by long experience how soon new toys lose their charm if they are  not prudently used.    Everyone was very kind to Daisy that afternoon. Tommy promised her the  first fruits of his garden, though the only visible crop just then was  pigweed; Nat offered to supply her with wood, free of charge; Stuffy  quite worshipped her; Ned immediately fell to work on a little  refrigerator for her kitchen; and Demi, with a punctuality beautiful  to see in one so young, escorted her to the nursery just as the clock  struck five. It was not time for the party to begin, but he begged so  hard to come in and help that he was allowed privileges few visitors  enjoy, for he kindled the fire, ran errands, and watched the progress  of his supper with intense interest. Mrs. Jo directed the affair as she  came and went, being very busy putting up clean curtains all over the  house.    \"Ask Asia for a cup of sour cream, then your cakes will be light without  much soda, which I don't like,\" was the first order.    Demi tore downstairs, and returned with the cream, also a puckered-up  face, for he had tasted it on his way, and found it so sour that he  predicted the cakes would be uneatable. Mrs. Jo took this occasion to  deliver a short lecture from the step-ladder on the chemical properties  of soda, to which Daisy did not listen, but Demi did, and understood it,  as he proved by the brief but comprehensive reply:    \"Yes, I see, soda turns sour things sweet, and the fizzling up makes  them light. Let's see you do it, Daisy.\"    \"Fill that bowl nearly full of flour and add a little salt to it,\"  continued Mrs. Jo.    \"Oh dear, everything has to have salt in it, seems to me,\" said Sally,  who was tired of opening the pill-box in which it was kept.    \"Salt is like good-humor, and nearly every thing is better for a pinch  of it, Posy,\" and Uncle Fritz stopped as he passed,"]]]
