He hasn't the slightest doubt  about himself and neither has any sensible person a doubt about him;  but Carmen is not a sensible person.    The bull-fighter has been trying the same trick upon Carmen that she  tried upon Jose. She is not indifferent to his fascinations,  but--well, there is trouble coming her way, Escamillo's way, Jose's  way, everybody's way, but it is some comfort to know that they all  more or less deserve it.    When Escamillo has finished singing of his greatness, he asks Carmen  what she would think of him if he told her he loved her, and for once  in a way she is quite truthful. She tells him she would think him a  fool.    \"You are not over-encouraging, my girl, but I can wait,\" he returns.    \"I am sure there is no harm in waiting,\" she answers him.    Now Carmen's familiar friends, the smugglers, have an enterprise in  hand, and it has been their habit to look to Carmen, Frasquita, and  Mercedes for help in their smuggling. When they find an opportunity,  they approach Carmen.    \"We need your help to-night.\"    \"Indeed! well, you won't get it,\" she declares.    \"What! you won't attend to business?\"    \"I won't.\"    \"What's the matter now?\" El Dancairo, chief of the smugglers, demands.    \"If you particularly want to know--why, then, I am in love--for  to-night only,\" she hastens to add, as the smugglers stare at her in  disgust.    \"Well, we wish you joy; but you'll show better sense to come along  with us. If you wait here, your lover is likely not to come, and  you'll lose the money in the bargain.\"         When any sly intrigue is weaving,       Whether for thieving,       Or for deceiving,       You will do well if you provide,       To have a woman on your side--    they sing--which shows what the smugglers think of their sisters and  their cousins and their aunts.    When they insist upon knowing for whom Carmen is going to wait at the  inn, she finally tells them she is waiting for Jose, and pretends to  some very nice sentiments indeed, on his account; says he got her out  of prison, has been locked up for her sake, and of course she must  treat him nicely.    \"Well, all we have to say about it is that you had better have a care.  Very likely he'll not come, and----\" El Dancairo is interrupted by a  song in the hills. It is Jose's voice signalling to Carmen.    \"Think not?\" she asks, nonchalantly.    When Jose enters, she really is glad to see him: he is very handsome  indeed. After her comrades have gone outside the inn, she tells Jose  of her regret that he has suffered for her, and starts to entertain  him.    There, in the dingy inn, she begins a wonderful dance, shaking her  castanets and making herself very beautiful and fascinating once more  to Jose. In the midst of the dance they hear a bugle call. Jose starts  up.    \"Carmen, it is my squad going back to camp. It is the retreat that has  sounded. I must go.\"    \"Go?\" she stares at him. Then, realizing that he is going to desert  her for duty, she flies into a rage, throws his shako after him and  screams at him to go and not come back. This puts Jose in a bad way,  because he has been able to think of nothing but Carmen ever since she  escaped and he went to prison in her place. Meantime, she raves about  the inn, declaring that he doesn't love her, whereupon he takes the  flower she once threw him, now dead and scentless, from his pocket,  and shows it to her. He has kept it safely through all that has  happened to him.    \"That is all very well, Don Jose, but if you truly loved me, you would  leave this soldiering which takes you away, and go live with me and my  companions in the mountains. There, there is no law, no duties,  no----\" Don Jose nearly faints at the idea.    \"Disgrace my uniform!\" he cries.    \"Let your uniform go hang,\" she answers. She never was any too choice  in her language. Poor Jose! poor wretch! he buries his face in his  hands, and cries several times, \"My God!\" and looks so distracted that  one almost believes he will pull himself together, take his shako, and  go back to his men. Presently he decides that he will go, and starts  toward the door, when there comes a knocking.    \"What's that?\" he whispers, pausing; but almost at the moment, Zuniga,  looking for Carmen, opens the door.    \"Fie, Carmen! Is this your taste?\" the captain laughs, pointing to  Jose. Jose is only a corporal, while Zuniga, being a captain, feels in  a corporal's presence like a general at the very least.    \"Come on, get out,\" he demands of Jose.    \"No,\" Jose answers. \"I think not,\" and there is no doubt he means it.  Then the men begin to fight. Carmen, desiring to have one of them to  torment, throws herself between them. Her screams bring the gipsies  and smugglers.    \"Seize the captain,\" she cries, and Zuniga is seized and tied. He  roars and fumes and threatens, but the smugglers carry him off. This  puts Jose in a truly bad way. How can he return and tell Zuniga's men  what has happened? and then when Zuniga is free he will be tried by  court-martial and suffer the worst, beyond doubt.    \"Now then, Jose. What about it? You can't go back to your company,  eh?\"    \"This is horrible,\" he tells her. \"I am a ruined man.\"    \"Then come with us and make the best of it,\" she cries, and Fate  scores again.      ACT III    Disgraced, there is nothing left for Jose but to go away to the  smugglers' retreat in the mountains. There, in a cave looking out to  sea, well located above the valley for smuggling operations, all the  gipsies and the smugglers, headed by El Dancairo, lie waiting for the  hour when they can go out without being caught. There, too, is Don  Jose, sitting gloomily apart, cut off from all that is good,  dishonoured and so distressed that he is no longer a good companion.  Carmen looks at him, and feels angry because he seems to be  indifferent to her.    \"What do you see, that you sit staring down there into the valley?\"  she asks.    \"I was thinking that yonder is living a good, industrious old woman,  who thinks me a man of honour, but she is wrong, alas!\"    \"And who is this good old woman, pray?\" Carmen sneers.    \"If you love me do not speak thus,\" he returns, \"for she is my  mother.\"    \"Ah, indeed! Well, I think you need her. I advise you to return to  her.\" Don Jose needed her more than he knew.    \"And if I went back--what about you?\"    \"Me? What about me, pray? I stay where I belong--with my friends.\"    \"Then you expect me to give you up, for whom I have lost all that I  had in life!\" Realizing that he has given so much for so little, his  bitterness becomes uncontrollable, and though he says nothing, Carmen  surprises a horrid look on his face.    \"You'll be committing murder next, if you look like that,\" she laughs.  \"Well, you are not very good company. Hello, there! Mercedes,  Frasquita--anybody instead of this fool--let's amuse ourselves. Get  the cards. Let us tell our fortunes, eh?\" The three girls gather about  the table; the other two shuffle and cut. The cards turn out well for  them. Carmen watches them. After a moment she reaches for the pack.  She is very nonchalant about it, and glances at Jose as she shuffles  the cards. Then she sits half upon the table and cuts. A glance! a  moment of sudden fear! she has cut death for herself! The blow has  come to her in her most reckless moment. After an instant's pause she  sings with a simple fatalism in voice and manner:         In vain to shun the answer that we dread.    She cuts the cards again and yet again. Still her dreadful fate  appears.    \"There is no hope,\" she murmurs to herself, as El Dancairo starts up  and cries:    \"'Tis time to be off. The way is clear. Come.\"    The others, headed by Remendado and El Dancairo, file down the path,  leaving Don Jose alone in the cave. It is a dismal scene: the  loneliness of Jose, the menace of death in the air!    While Jose sits with bowed head, a girl's figure rises behind the  rocks, and almost at the same moment there appears the form of a man,  as well. Jose hears the rolling of the stones beneath their feet and  starts up, musket in hand. Just as he rises, he sees the man's head.  The girl cries out as he fires upon the man, and misses him; then she  crouches down behind the rock. It is Michaela, come to find Jose  wherever he may be. She knows of his disgrace; it is killing his  mother. The lonely old woman is dying. Michaela has come to fetch him,  if he has not lost all memory of gentler hours. As Jose fires, the man  shouts.    \"Hey, there! what are you about?\"    \"What are _you_ about? What do you want up here?\"    \"If you were not so ready with your gun, my friend, you are more  likely to find out. I'm Escamillo the Toreador.\"    \"Oh, well, then come up. I know you and you are welcome enough, but  you run a fearful risk, let me tell you. You haven't sought very good  company, I suppose you know.\"    \"I don't care particularly; because, my friend, I am in love, if you  want to know.\"    \"Do you expect to find her here?\"    \"I am looking for her,\" Escamillo returns, complaisantly.    \"These women are all gipsies.\"    \"Good enough: so is Carmen.\"    \"Carmen!\" Jose cries, his heart seeming to miss a beat.    \"That's her name. She had a lover up here--a soldier who deserted from  his troop to join her--but that's past history. It's all up with him  now.\" Jose listens and tries not to betray himself.    \"Do you know that when a rival tries to take a gipsy girl from her  lover there is a price to pay?\" he tries to ask with some show of  tranquillity.    \"Very well, I am ready.\"    \"A knife thrust, you understand,\" Jose mutters, unable to hide his  emotion. He hates Escamillo so much that he is about to spring upon  him.    \"Ho, ho! From your manner, I fancy you are that fine deserter. You  want to fight? Good! I fight bulls for pleasure; you used to fight"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2872"],[0,"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication — Volume 2 (#13)"],[1,"the species of the same genus,  some such rules may hold good; for instance, it seems that in reciprocally  crossing various breeds of fowls the male generally gives colour (14/20.  'Cottage Gardener' 1856 pages 101, 137.); but conspicuous exceptions have  passed under my own eyes. It seems that the ram usually gives its peculiar  horns and fleece to its crossed offspring, and the bull the presence or  absence of horns.    In the following chapter on Crossing I shall have occasion to show that  certain characters are rarely or never blended by crossing, but are  transmitted in an unmodified state from either parent-form; I refer to this  fact here because it is sometimes accompanied on the one side by prepotency,  which thus acquires the false appearance of unusual strength. In the same  chapter I shall show that the rate at which a species or breed absorbs and  obliterates another by repeated crosses, depends in chief part on prepotency  in transmission.]    In conclusion, some of the cases above given,--for instance, that of the  trumpeter pigeon,--prove that there is a wide difference between mere  inheritance and prepotency. This latter power seems to us, in our ignorance,  to act in most cases quite capriciously. The very same character, even though  it be an abnormal or monstrous one, such as silky feathers, may be transmitted  by different species, when crossed, either with prepotent force or singular  feebleness. It is obvious, that a purely-bred form of either sex, in all cases  in which prepotency does not run more strongly in one sex than the other, will  transmit its character with prepotent force over a mongrelised and already  variable form. (14/21. See some remarks on this head with respect to sheep by  Mr. Wilson in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1863 page 15. Many striking instances of  this result are given by M. Malingie-Nouel 'Journ. R. Agricult. Soc.' volume  14 1853 page 220 with respect to crosses between English and French sheep. He  found that he obtained the desired influence of the English breeds by crossing  intentionally mongrelised French breeds with pure English breeds.) From  several of the above-given cases we may conclude that mere antiquity of  character does not by any means necessarily make it prepotent. In some cases  prepotency apparently depends on the same character being present and visible  in one of the two breeds which are crossed, and latent or invisible in the  other breed; and in this case it is natural that the character which is  potentially present in both breeds should be prepotent. Thus, we have reason  to believe that there is a latent tendency in all horses to be dun-coloured  and striped; and when a horse of this kind is crossed with one of any other  colour, it is said that the offspring are almost sure to be striped. Sheep  have a similar latent tendency to become dark-coloured, and we have seen with  what prepotent force a ram with a few black spots, when crossed with white  sheep of various breeds, coloured its offspring. All pigeons have a latent  tendency to become slaty-blue, with certain characteristic marks, and it is  known that, when a bird thus coloured is crossed with one of any other colour,  it is most difficult afterwards to eradicate the blue tint. A nearly parallel  case is offered by those black bantams which, as they grow old, develop a  latent tendency to acquire red feathers. But there are exceptions to the rule:  hornless breeds of cattle possess a latent capacity to reproduce horns, yet  when crossed with horned breeds they do not invariably produce offspring  bearing horns.    We meet with analogous cases with plants. Striped flowers, though they can be  propagated truly by seed, have a latent tendency to become uniformly coloured,  but when once crossed by a uniformly coloured variety, they ever afterwards  fail to produce striped seedlings. (14/22. Verlot 'Des Varietes' 1865 page  66.) Another case is in some respects more curious: plants bearing peloric  flowers have so strong a latent tendency to reproduce their normally irregular  flowers, that this often occurs by buds when a plant is transplanted into  poorer or richer soil. (14/23. Moquin-Tandon 'Teratologie' page 191.) Now I  crossed the peloric snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), described in the last  chapter, with pollen of the common form; and the latter, reciprocally, with  peloric pollen. I thus raised two great beds of seedlings, and not one was  peloric. Naudin (14/24. 'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page 137.)  obtained the same result from crossing a peloric Linaria with the common form.  I carefully examined the flowers of ninety plants of the crossed Antirrhinum  in the two beds, and their structure had not been in the least affected by the  cross, except that in a few instances the minute rudiment of the fifth stamen,  which is always present, was more fully or even completely developed. It must  not be supposed that this entire obliteration of the peloric structure in the  crossed plants can be accounted for by any incapacity of transmission; for I  raised a large bed of plants from the peloric Antirrhinum, artificially  fertilised by its own pollen, and sixteen plants, which alone survived the  winter, were all as perfectly peloric as the parent-plant. Here we have a good  instance of the wide difference between the inheritance of a character and the  power of transmitting it to crossed offspring. The crossed plants, which  perfectly resembled the common snapdragon, were allowed to sow themselves, and  out of a hundred and twenty-seven seedlings, eighty-eight proved to be common  snapdragons, two were in an intermediate condition between the peloric and  normal state, and thirty-seven were perfectly peloric, having reverted to the  structure of their one grand-parent. This case seems at first sight to offer  an exception to the rule just given, namely, that a character which is present  in one form and latent in the other is generally transmitted with prepotent  force when the two forms are crossed. For in all the Scrophulariaceae, and  especially in the genera Antirrhinum and Linaria, there is, as was shown in  the last chapter, a strong latent tendency to become peloric; but there is  also, as we have seen, a still stronger tendency in all peloric plants to  reacquire their normal irregular structure. So that we have two opposed latent  tendencies in the same plants. Now, with the crossed Antirrhinums the tendency  to produce normal or irregular flowers, like those of the common Snapdragon,  prevailed in the first generation; whilst the tendency to pelorism, appearing  to gain strength by the intermission of a generation, prevailed to a large  extent in the second set of seedlings. How it is possible for a character to  gain strength by the intermission of a generation, will be considered in the  chapter on pangenesis.    On the whole, the subject of prepotency is extremely intricate,--from its  varying so much in strength, even in regard to the same character, in  different animals,--from its running either equally in both sexes, or, as  frequently is the case with animals, but not with plants, much stronger in one  sex than the other,--from the existence of secondary sexual characters,--from  the transmission of certain characters being limited, as we shall immediately  see, by sex,--from certain characters not blending together,--and, perhaps,  occasionally from the effects of a previous fertilisation on the mother. It is  therefore not surprising that no one has hitherto succeeded in drawing up  general rules on the subject of prepotency.    INHERITANCE AS LIMITED BY SEX.    New characters often appear in one sex, and are afterwards transmitted to the  same sex, either exclusively or in a much greater degree than to the other.  This subject is important, because with animals of many kinds in a state of  nature, both high and low in the scale, secondary sexual characters, not  directly connected with the organs of reproduction, are conspicuously present.  With our domesticated animals, characters of this kind often differ widely  from those distinguishing the two sexes of the parent species; and the  principle of inheritance, as limited by sex, explains how this is possible.    [Dr. P. Lucas has shown (14/25. 'L'Hered. Nat.' tome 2 pages 137-165. See also  Mr. Sedgwick's four memoirs, immediately to be referred to.) that when a  peculiarity, in no manner connected with the reproductive organs, appears in  either parent, it is often transmitted exclusively to the offspring of the  same sex, or to a much greater number of them than of the opposite sex. Thus,  in the family of Lambert, the horn-like projections on the skin were  transmitted from the father to his sons and grandsons alone; so it has been  with other cases of ichthyosis, with supernumerary digits, with a deficiency  of digits and phalanges, and in a lesser degree with various diseases,  especially with colour-blindness and the haemorrhagic diathesis, that is, an  extreme liability to profuse and uncontrollable bleeding from trifling wounds.  On the other hand, mothers have transmitted, during several generations, to  their daughters alone, supernumerary and deficient digits, colour-blindness  and other peculiarities. So that the very same peculiarity may become attached  to either sex, and be long inherited by that sex alone; but the attachment in  certain cases is much more frequent to one than the other sex. The same  peculiarities also may be promiscuously transmitted to either sex. Dr. Lucas  gives other cases, showing that the male occasionally transmits his  peculiarities to his daughters alone, and the mother to her sons alone; but  even in this case we see that inheritance is to a certain extent, though  inversely, regulated by sex. Dr. Lucas, after weighing the whole evidence,  comes to the conclusion that every peculiarity tends to be transmitted in a  greater or lesser degree to"]]]
