Its history, (#13)"],[1," open cage, less cared for and  protected than bales of merchandise, exposed to the rain, to the heat  of the sun, to sudden changes of temperature, to cold and cutting  draughts, increased by the rapid motion of the train;--these animals,  foundered, prostrate, panting with fever and torturing pains, still have  to undergo new trials, if they cross the sea. In this case, the wretched  victims are violently expelled from the locomotive, rocking sheds of the  railway; a leathern strap hanging from a crane lifts them into the air,  and lets them down into the mid-deck of a ship, where they are crowded  as closely together as possible, for here, too, space is very costly.  Finally, the vessel gets under way and ploughs the ocean; contrary winds  beat it about in every direction, and these poor creatures have to  endure a new kind of torture, accompanied by the intolerable pangs of  sea-sickness; and in this state it is that they alight on the British  soil, and are driven off to the different markets.    It is useless to expatiate at length on the state of general derangement  and disease in which these oxen reach their final destination. Some  amongst them have endured for eight or nine days these unspeakable  tortures, without being sustained by nourishment--for no animal, when  his spirits forsake him, can assimilate his food amidst all this  physical suffering and so great a shock to his nervous system.    Let us here declare that these animals, though removed from their  meadows with all the signs and appearances of sound health, at a time  when a fine season had been productive of abundance, and when no  epizootia was raging in the country which they have left, may  nevertheless bear within them the taint of contagious typhus; and let us  ask ourselves what must come to pass in those disastrous years when this  typhus prevails under the influence of those destructive causes which  were passed in review just now, and when the Russian and Hungarian  proprietors, eager to forestall an inevitable general calamity, hasten  to send off to Italy, France, Holland, Finland, or to the ports of  England, many animals already seized with typhus, and whose virus must  have acquired infectious properties still more intense and deadly under  the influence of the deep disquiet and commotion which the removal and  conveyance of these animals, under conditions so deplorable, must have  produced in their frames.    Such are indeed the pernicious conditions in which oxen may be, and  often are, dispatched to England; and such appears to be the real cause  of the outbreak of the spreading epizootia which we witness at this  moment, and which has created so much alarm in so many counties of  England.[B]      IV.    Let us now consider this contagious typhus in its destructive extension  over the British soil; let us study and examine the causes of its  diffusion as they pass under our notice.    The mooted question of determining whether the cattle typhus was  originally imported from abroad, or whether it broke out spontaneously  in England, has been, and still is, a subject of dubious debate amongst  some professional men, amongst the leading writers of the public  journals, and also amongst agriculturists and farmers.[C]    And, in truth, the propagation of the distemper is occasionally  witnessed under conditions so singular and striking, that it seems to  warrant and supply arguments for every conceivable opinion.    When the disease was recognised and identified for the first time on the  24th of June, 1865, public opinion ascribed its appearance to contagion  arising from some diseased cows imported from Finland, and which, after  being exposed in the Islington Market on the 19th, were sold and removed  to the cowsheds of a breeder or dairyman.    We may observe that, on hearing the intelligence of this sudden  invasion, the public mind, which is so excitable in England, did not  disguise the indignation it felt against foreign countries which had  been capable of contaminating an island so advantageously situated and  so well protected, and infecting her magnificent herds, exuberant with  health. But after a closer examination of the facts, and possibly  alarmed, at the serious consequences of a Continental blockade which  would deprive the United Kingdom, not of the entire twenty or thirty  thousand live stock, such as oxen, sheep, pigs, &c., which they receive  every week, but only of the eight or ten thousand head of cattle which  are landed weekly on their coasts to supply their markets, public  opinion was appeased. But, unfortunately, this national susceptibility  now took the opposite extreme; and the only causes it now saw were the  dirt and want of adequate ventilation in the metropolitan stables and  sheds; and to these causes it attributed, first the generation, and then  the propagation or diffusion of the malady; an opinion which appeared  all the more natural and reasonable, in that the oxen and cows of the  graziers were the first victims of the typhus.    We all know how liable, among all nations, the public mind is to waver  and fluctuate, and how susceptible and open it is to new impressions  during fatal visitations and general calamities; nor can we feel the  least surprise at the uncertainty which has so long prevailed, and still  continues, as to the real causes of the introduction of the bovine  typhus in England.    Let us therefore examine this question of etiology, and try to discover  what opinion ought to prevail.    It is important to establish at once two material facts which seem to us  indisputable:    1st. That the contagious typhus in cattle which is known to be permanent  in the southeast of Europe, actually existed there during the month of  June, 1865; 2nd, That some of the horned cattle, fed and reared in that  part of Europe, were transported to England, after having crossed  through Russia from south to north, in order to avoid passing through  Germany.    As for the first of these facts, it is admitted and received, as might  easily be proved by reproducing the speeches and addresses delivered by  the veterinary doctors at the Congress now being held at Vienna, and at  which were present the men whose experience of this cattle distemper  gives them the highest authority--Hertwig, Jessen, Roell, Siegmund,  Gerlach, &c.    The contagious typhus of horned cattle is so fully in the epizootic  state in those countries which are washed by the Black Sea, that it was  enough for the veterinarians present at the Congress to manifest a  desire to see cattle afflicted with this disease, for the opportunity so  to do to be immediately afforded them.[D]    Thus, then, the fact is undeniable, the contagious typhus was raging, in  June, 1865, in Hungary and Russia, as it rages there at all times.    As for the conveyance of cattle from those countries into England, the  fact is no less certain and assured. It is well known that a convoy of  300 heads of cattle, proceeding from the pasture-grounds of Hungary and  Austria, was transported into Finland by rail, and afterwards shipped at  Revel for England. Thanks to the rapid locomotion by steam, the  migration of these cattle had lasted but ten days--two days for the  transport by land, and eight days for the passage by sea, through the  tortuous line of the Baltic; but this was sufficient length of time for  the incubation to be produced, even supposing the animals to have looked  sound when their transit began.    Moreover, it is indubitable that the markets of this immeasurable London  have for many years been supplied with horned cattle from every country:  from France, Holland, Belgium, Podolia, Poland, Prussia, Austria,  Hungary, and Russia.    Thus, the Islington Market (the fact is assured) had received horned  cattle imported from the countries where typhus is known to be  permanent. Were these cattle thus imported affected with the typhus?  This fact likewise is as certain as the other, since two of the foreign  cows thus imported, were the first to fall sick, and to die of this  typhus.    But if the contagious typhus of horned cattle rages permanently on the  banks of the streams which discharge themselves into the Black Sea, and  if the beasts reared in those countries have long been transported to  England and other countries, how, it will be asked, is it that the  disease has not broken out more frequently, for it has never been seen  in Great Britain, at least, during the former part of the nineteenth  century?    This question is not devoid of a certain degree of importance, and  deserves to fix our attention for a moment.    Now the conditions in which the animals were exhibited in 1863 and 1864  were precisely the same as those of 1865, before the outbreak of the  disease; and yet the contagion has been possible in 1865, whilst it was  not so in 1863.    We do not presume to explain the mysterious phenomena which govern the  development of epidemics and epizootics; but it seems to us not  altogether impossible to give a rational and satisfactory elucidation of  the facts.    In general, in _epizootics_, and I might even say in some particular  epidemics--in that of the typhus, for instance--three connected and  inseparable facts form the condition _sine qua non_, of the generation  of the disease. First, a focus for producing the virus; secondly, for  the most part a favourable soil, and a special predisposition amongst  animals to receive and propagate it; thirdly, what is called an epidemic  or epizootic genius--that is to say, a particular state of the  atmospheric elements, or the air, which hitherto has escaped our  analyses, and whose morbific properties vary in their degrees of  intensity. Thus the epizootic genius of 1711, the terrible one of 1750,  and the one which now diffuses its contagious miasma, have differed in  some of their virulent conditions.    However that may be, it will be sufficient to glance back at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36504"],[0,"Freshwater Sponges, Hydroids & Polyzoa (#13)"],[1," germinate until well on in the \"rains.\" Even then,  after about five months, only a few of them did so. Zykoff found that in  Europe gemmules kept for two years were still alive and able to  germinate.    Germination consists in the cellular contents of the gemmule bursting  the membrane or membranes in which they are enclosed, and making their  way out of the gemmule in the form of a delicate whitish mass, which  sometimes issues through the natural aperture in the outer chitinous  coat and sometimes through an actual rent in this coat. In the latter  case the development of the young sponge is more advanced than in the  former.    The fullest account of development from the gemmule as yet published is  by Zykoff, and refers to _Ephydatia_ in Europe (Biol. Centralbl. Berlin,  xii, p. 713, 1892).    His investigations show that the bursting of the gemmule is not merely a  mechanical effect of moisture or any such agency but is due to  development of the cellular contents, which at the time they escape have  at least undergone differentiation into two layers. Of the more  important soft structures in the sponge the osculum is the first to  appear, the ciliated chambers being formed later. This is the opposite  of what occurs in the case of the bud, but in both cases the aperture  appears to be produced by the pressure of water in the organism. The  manner and order in which the different kinds of cells originate in the  sponge derived from a gemmule give support to the view that the  primitive cell-layers on which morphologists lay great stress are not of  any great importance so far as sponges are concerned.    (c) _Development of the Bud._    As the bud of _Spongilla proliferens_ grows it makes its way up the  skeleton-fibre to which it was originally attached, pushing the dermal  membrane, which expands with its growth, before it. The skeleton-fibre  does not, however, continue to grow in the bud, in which a number of  finer fibres make their appearance, radiating from a point approximately  at the centre of the mass. As the bud projects more and more from the  surface of the sponge the dermal membrane contracts at its base, so as  finally to separate it from its parent. Further details are given on p.  74.      HABITAT.    Mr. Edward Potts[P], writing on the freshwater sponges of North America,  says:--\"These organisms have occasionally been discovered growing in  water unfit for domestic uses; but as a rule they prefer pure water, and  in my experience the finest specimens have always been found where they  are subjected to the most rapid currents.\" True as this is of the  Spongillidae of temperate climates, it is hardly applicable to those of  tropical India, for in this country we find many species growing most  luxuriantly and commonly in water that would certainly be considered  unfit for domestic purposes in a country in which sanitation was treated  as a science. Some species, indeed, are only found in ponds of water  polluted by human agency, and such ponds, provided that other conditions  are favourable, are perhaps the best collecting grounds. Other  favourable conditions consist in a due mixture of light and shade, a  lack of disturbance such as that caused by cleaning out the pond, and  above all in the presence of objects suitable for the support of  sponges.         [Footnote P: P. Ac. Philad. 1887, p. 162.]    I do not know exactly why light and shade must be mixed in a habitat  favourable for the growth of sponges, for most species prefer shade, if  it be not too dense; but it is certainly the case that, with a few  exceptions, Indian Spongillidae flourish best in water shaded at the  edges by trees and exposed to sunlight elsewhere. One of the exceptions  to this rule is the Indian race of _Spongilla lucustris_, which is found  in small pools of water in sand-dunes without a particle of shade.  Several species are only found on the lower surface of stones and roots  in circumstances which do not suggest that their position merely  protects them from mud, which, as Mr. Potts points out, is their \"great  enemy.\" A notable instance is _Trochospongilla pennsylvanica_, which is  found hiding away from light in America and Europe as well as in India.    It is curious that it should be easy to exterminate the sponges in a  pond by cleaning it out, for one would have thought that sufficient  gemmules would have remained at the edge, or would have been brought  rapidly from elsewhere, to restock the water. Mr. Green has, however,  noted that _Spongilla carteri_ has disappeared for some years from a  small lake at Peradeniya in which it was formerly abundant, owing to the  lake having been cleaned out, and I have made similar observations on  several occasions in Calcutta.    The question of the objects to which sponges attach themselves is one  intimately connected with that of the injury done them by mud. The delta  of the Ganges is one of the muddiest districts on earth. There are no  stones or rocks in the rivers and ponds, but mud everywhere. If a sponge  settles in the mud its canals are rapidly choked, its vital processes  cease, and it dies. In this part of India, therefore, most sponges are  found fixed either to floating objects such as logs of wood, to vertical  objects such as the stems of bulrushes and other aquatic plants, or to  the tips of branches that overhang the water and become submerged during  the \"rains.\" In Calcutta man has unwittingly come to the assistance of  the sponges, not only by digging tanks but also by building  \"bathing-ghats\" of brick at the edge, and constructing, with aesthetic  intentions if not results, masses of artificial concrete rocks in or  surrounding the water. There are at least two sponges (the typical form  of _Spongilla alba_ and _Ephydatia meyeni_) which in Calcutta are only  found attached to such objects. The form of _S. alba_, however, that is  found in ponds of brackish water in the Gangetic delta has not derived  this artificial assistance from man, except in the few places where  brick bridges have been built, and attaches itself to the stem and roots  of a kind of grass that grows at the edge of brackish water. This sponge  seems to have become immune even to mud, the particles of which are  swallowed by its cells and finally got rid of without blocking up the  canals.    Several Indian sponges are only found adhering to stones and rocks.  Among these species _Corvospongilla lapidosa_ and our representatives of  the subgenus _Stratospongilla_ are noteworthy. Some forms (e. g.  _Spongilla carteri_ and _S. crateriformis_) seem, however, to be just as  much at home in muddy as in rocky localities, although they avoid the  mud itself.    There is much indirect evidence that the larvae of freshwater sponges  exercise a power of selection as regards the objects to which they affix  themselves on settling down for life.    Few Spongillidae are found in salt or brackish water, but _Spongilla  alba_ var. _bengalensis_ has been found in both, and is abundant in the  latter; indeed, it has not been found in pure fresh water. _Spongilla  travancorica_ has only been found in slightly brackish water, while _S.  lacustris_ subsp. _reticulata_ and _Dosilia plumosa_ occur in both fresh  and brackish water, although rarely in the latter. The Spongillidae are  essentially a freshwater family, and those forms that are found in any  but pure fresh water must be regarded as aberrant or unusually tolerant  in their habits, not as primitive marine forms that still linger halfway  to the sea.      ANIMALS AND PLANTS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH  FRESHWATER SPONGES.      (a) _Enemies._    Freshwater sponges have few living enemies. Indeed, it is difficult to  say exactly what is an enemy of a creature so loosely organized as a  sponge. There can be little doubt, in any case, that the neuropteroid  larva (_Sisyra indica_) which sucks the cells of several species should  be classed in this category, and it is noteworthy that several species  of the same genus also occur in Europe and N. America which also attack  sponges. Other animals that may be enemies are a midge larva (_Tanypus_  sp.) and certain worms that bore through the parenchyma (p. 93), but I  know of no animal that devours sponges bodily, so long as they are  uninjured. If their external membrane is destroyed, they are immediately  attacked by various little fish and also by snails of the genera  _Limnaea_ and _Planorbis_, and prawns of the genus _Palaemon_.    Their most active and obvious enemy is a plant, not an animal,--to wit,  a filamentous alga that blocks up their canals by its rapid growth (p.  79).    (b) _Beneficial Organisms._    The most abundant and possibly the most important organisms that may be  considered as benefactors to the Spongillidae are the green corpuscles  that live in the cells of certain species (fig. 2, p. 31), notably  _Spongilla lacustris_, _S. proliferens_, and _Dosilia plumosa_. I have  already said that these bodies are in all probability algae which live  free in the water and move actively at one stage of their existence, but  some of them are handed on directly from a sponge to its descendants in  the cells of the gemmule. In their quiescent stage they have been  studied by several zoologists, notably by Sir Ray Lankester[Q] and Dr.  W. Weltner[R], but the strongest light that has been cast on their  origin is given by the researches of Dr. F. W. Gamble and Mr. F. Keeble  (Q. J. Microsc. Sci. London, xlvii, p. 363, 1904, and li, p. 167, 1907).  These researches do not refer directly to the Spongillidae but to a  little flat-worm that lives in the sea, _Convoluta roscoffiensis_. The  green corpuscles of this worm so closely resemble those of _Spongilla_  that we are justified in supposing a similarity of origin. It has been  shown by the authors cited that the green corpuscles of the worm are at  one stage minute free-living organisms provided at one end with four"]]]
