The work of  MICHELL and WILSON he alludes to again and again, and always with  appreciation. Certainly he seems to show a vein of annoyance that the  papers of CHRISTIAN MAYER, _De novis in coelo sidereo phaenomenis_  (1779), and _Beobachtungen von Fixsterntrabanten_ (1778), should have  been quoted to prove that the method proposed by HERSCHEL in 1782 for  ascertaining the parallax of the fixed stars by means of observations of  those which were double, was not entirely original with himself.    There is direct proof that it was so,[22] and if this was not  forthcoming it would be unnecessary, as he has amply shown in his  Catalogue of Double Stars. One is reminded of his remarks on the use of  the high magnifying powers by the impatience of his comments.    His proposal to call the newly discovered minor planets _asteroids_  (1802) was received as a sign that he wished to discriminate between the  discoveries of PIAZZI and OLBERS and his own discovery of URANUS.[23]    He takes pains to quietly put this on one side in one of his papers,  showing that he was cognizant of the existence of such a feeling.    I am tempted to resurrect from a deserved obscurity a notice of  HERSCHEL'S _Observations on the Two Lately Discovered Celestial Bodies_  (_Philosophical Transactions_, 1802), printed in the first volume  of the _Edinburgh Review_, simply to show the kind of envy to which even  he, the glory of England, was subject.    The reviewer sets forth the principal results of HERSCHEL'S  observations, and, after quoting his definition of the new term  asteroid, goes on to say:        \"If a new name must be found, why not call them by some appellation      which shall, in some degree, be descriptive of, or at least      consistent with, their properties? Why not, for instance, call them      _Concentric Comets_, or _Planetary Comets_, or _Cometary Planets_?      or, if a single term must be found, why may we not coin such a      phrase as _Planetoid_ or _Cometoid_?\"    Then follows a general arraignment of HERSCHEL'S methods of expression  and thought, as distinguished from his powers of mere observation. This  distinction, it may be said, exists only in the reviewer's mind; there  was no such distinction in fact. If ever a series of observations was  directed by profound and reasonable thought, it was HERSCHEL'S own.        \"Dr. HERSCHEL'S passion for coining words and idioms has often      struck us as a weakness wholly unworthy of him. The invention of a      name is but a poor achievement for him who has discovered whole      worlds. Why, for instance, do we hear him talking of the      _space-penetrating power_ of his instrument--a compound epithet and      metaphor which he ought to have left to the poets, who, in some      future age, shall acquire glory by celebrating his name. The other      papers of Dr. HERSCHEL, in the late volumes of the _Transactions_,      do not deserve such particular attention. His catalogue of 500 new      nebulae, though extremely valuable to the practical astronomer, leads      to no general conclusions of importance, and abounds with the      defects which are peculiar to the Doctor's writings--a great      prolixity and tediousness of narration--loose and often      unphilosophical reflections, which give no very favorable idea of      his scientific powers, however great his merit may be as an      observer--above all, that idle fondness for inventing names without      any manner of occasion, to which we have already alluded, and a use      of novel and affected idioms.           *       *       *       *       *        \"To the speculations of the Doctor on the nature of the Sun, we have      many similar objections; but they are all eclipsed by the grand      absurdity which he has there committed, in his hasty and erroneous      theory concerning the influence of the solar spots on the price of      grain. Since the publication of Gulliver's voyage to Laputa, nothing      so ridiculous has ever been offered to the world. We heartily wish      the Doctor had suppressed it; or, if determined to publish it, that      he had detailed it in language less confident and flippant.\"    One is almost ashamed to give space and currency to a forgotten attack,  but it yields a kind of perspective; and it is instructive and perhaps  useful to view HERSCHEL'S labors from all sides, even from wrong and  envious ones.    The study of the original papers, together with a knowledge of the  circumstances in which they were written, will abundantly show that  HERSCHEL'S ideas sprung from a profound meditation of the nature of  things in themselves. What the origin of trains of thought prosecuted  for years may have been we cannot say, nor could he himself have  expressed it. A new path in science was to be found out, and he found  it. It was not in his closet, surrounded by authorities, but under the  open sky, that he meditated the construction of the heavens. As he says,  \"My situation permitted me not to consult large libraries; nor, indeed,  was it very material; for as I intended to view the heavens myself,  Nature, that great volume, appeared to me to contain the best  catalogue.\"    His remarkable memoirs on the invisible and other rays of the solar  spectrum were received with doubt, and with open denial by many of the  scientific bodies of Europe. The reviews and notices of his work in this  direction were often quite beyond the bounds of a proper scientific  criticism; but HERSCHEL maintained a dignified silence. The discoveries  were true, the proofs were open to all, and no response was needed from  him. He may have been sorely tempted to reply, but I am apt to believe  that the rumors that reached him from abroad and at home did not then  affect him as they might have done earlier. He was at his grand  climacteric, he had passed his sixty-third year, his temper was less  hasty than it had been in his youth, and his nerves had not yet received  the severe strain from whose effects he suffered during the last years  of his life.           *       *       *       *       *    We have some glimpses of his personal life in the reminiscences of him  in the _Diary and Letters_ of Madame D'ARBLAY, who knew him well:        \"1786.--In the evening Mr. HERSCHEL came to tea. I had once seen      that very extraordinary man at Mrs. DE LUC'S, but was happy to see      him again, for he has not more fame to awaken curiosity than sense      and modesty to gratify it. He is perfectly unassuming, yet openly      happy, and happy in the success of those studies which would render      a mind less excellently formed presumptuous and arrogant.        \"The king has not a happier subject than this man, who owes it      wholly to His Majesty that he is not wretched; for such was his      eagerness to quit all other pursuits to follow astronomy solely,      that he was in danger of ruin, when his talents and great and      uncommon genius attracted the king's patronage. He has now not only      his pension, which gives him the felicity of devoting all his time      to his darling study, but he is indulged in license from the king to      make a telescope according to his new ideas and discoveries, that is      to have no cost spared in its construction, and is wholly to be paid      for by His Majesty.        \"This seems to have made him happier even than the pension, as it      enables him to put in execution all his wonderful projects, from      which his expectations of future discoveries are so sanguine as to      make his present existence a state of almost perfect enjoyment.      Mr. LOCKE himself would be quite charmed with him.        \"He seems a man without a wish that has its object in the      terrestrial globe. At night Mr. HERSCHEL, by the king's command,      came to exhibit to His Majesty and the royal family the new comet      lately discovered by his sister, Miss HERSCHEL; and while I was      playing at piquet with Mrs. SCHWELLENBURG, the Princess AUGUSTA came      into the room and asked her if she chose to go into the garden and      look at it. She declined the offer, and the princess then made it to      me. I was glad to accept it for all sorts of reasons. We found him      at his telescope. The comet was very small, and had nothing grand or      striking in its appearance; but it is the first lady's comet, and I      was very desirous to see it. Mr. HERSCHEL then showed me some of his      new discovered universes, with all the good humor with which he      would have taken the same trouble for a brother or a sister      astronomer; there is no possibility of admiring his genius more than      his gentleness.\"        \"_1786, December 30th_.--This morning my dear father carried me to      Dr. HERSCHEL. That great and very extraordinary man received us      almost with open arms. He is very fond of my father, who is one of      the council of the Royal Society this year, as well as himself. . . .      At this time of day there was nothing to see but his instruments;      those, however, are curiosities sufficient. . . . I wished very much      to have seen his sister, . . . but she had been up all night, and      was then in bed.\"        \"_1787, September_.--Dr. HERSCHEL is a delightful man; so      unassuming with his great knowledge, so willing to dispense it to      the ignorant, and so cheerful and easy in his general manners, that,      were he no genius, it would be impossible not to remark him as a      pleasing and sensible man.\"        \"_1788, October 3d_.--We returned to Windsor at noon, and Mrs. DE      LUC sent me a most pressing invitation to tea and to hear a little      music. Two young ladies were to perform at her house in a little      concert. Dr. HERSCHEL was there, and accompanied them very sweetly      on the violin; his new-married wife was with him, and his sister."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29070"],[0,"Brighter Britain!

Several persons present are acquainted with Old Colonial, and when it is  known that we are going to join him, we are at once placed on the  footing of personal friends. Hospitality is offered, invitations to take  a drink at the bar are given us on all sides. We accept, for we are not  total abstainers--or sich!--and are in that condition when the foaming  tankard is an idea of supreme bliss.    The hotel is larger and more pretentious than that at Riverhead. It is  better built, and has a second storey and a balcony above the verandah.  It is furnished, too, in a style that would do credit to Auckland--we  particularly noticing some capital cabinet-work in the beautiful wood of  the mottled kauri.    And then we are treated to a dissertation on the wonderful advantages  and prospects of Helensville, some day to be a city and seaport, a  manufacturing centre and emporium of the vast trade of the great fertile  tracts of the Kaipara districts. We are assured that there is no place  in all New Zealand where it could be more advantageous to our future to  settle in than here. And so to supper, and finally to bed, to sleep, and  to dream of the wonders that shall be; to dream of cathedrals and  factories and theatres rising here, and supplanting the forest and scrub  around us; to dream of splendid streets along the banks of the Kaipara,  but streets which ever end in rocky wooded gullies, down which we plunge  incessantly, behind a rushing nightmare that is driven either by a demon  or by Dandy Jack.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 3: A railway across this portage was opened for traffic in  1876. It has since been continued from Riverhead to Auckland, and is  now--1882--being pushed forward to the north, from Helensville on to  Whangarei.]          CHAPTER IV.    IN THE KAIPARA.      The next morning after our arrival at Helensville, we go down to the  wharf, close behind the hotel, and embark on board the steamer _Lily_.  This vessel is the only regular means of communication, at present, with  the young settlements lying round the Kaipara. She is a much larger  craft than the _Gemini_, but she is of the same ancient and ruinous  character. One would have thought that, on these new waters, such craft  as there were must necessarily be new also.[4] Such does not appear to  be the case, however, for the steam service on the Waitemata and the  Kaipara is conducted by very second-hand old rattle-traps. Where they  were worn out I know not. Bad as they are, they are considered a local  improvement, for, until quite recently, settlers had to depend on small  sailing-boats, that plied very irregularly.    The Kaipara is a name applied rather indiscriminately to a river, a  harbour, and to a tract of country. The Kaipara river is that on which  Helensville stands. It waters an extensive valley, and, flowing  north-westerly, falls into the Kaipara Harbour, some miles below  Helensville. It is tidal to a short distance above the settlement.    The harbour is a vast inlet of the sea, almost land-locked, since its  entrance, the Heads, is only about three or four miles wide. Opening  from the harbour are sundry great estuaries, resembling the sea-lochs of  Western Scotland. They are the Kaipara, the Hoteo, the Oruawharo, the  Otamatea, the Wairau, the Arapaoa, and the Wairoa. Several of these have  branches. Thus the Pahi, to which we are going, branches out of the  Arapaoa. They are fed by creeks--that is to say, by freshwater rivers,  as one would call them at home. The tidal estuaries are here called  rivers; and the freshwater streams, of whatever size, creeks.    All these waters have the generic name of the Kaipara. The united  water-frontage is said to be over a thousand miles; and nearly two  million acres of land lying round are comprised within the so-called  Kaipara district. Ships of heavy tonnage can get up to Tokatoka on the  Wairoa, to Te Pahi and Te Otamatea, and within a short distance of  Helensville, these places being, respectively, from twenty-five to  thirty-five miles from the Heads. Smaller vessels can, of course, go  anywhere. The Wairoa creek is navigable for schooners and cutters for  more than eighty miles, as well as its tributaries, the Kaihu, Kopura,  Tauraroa, and Maungakahia.    We have come into a district admirably adapted for pioneer settlement.  For nature has supplied water-ways in every direction, and thus the  first great difficulty in opening up a new country, the want of roads,  is obviated. Here, indeed, as we shall find, no one walks to his  township, or rides to see a neighbour, he jumps into his boat and rows  or sails wherever he wants to go.    As the _Lily_ steams down the Kaipara, we get a better idea of the bush  than our previous day's coach-ride had given us. There is no more of the  brown and shaggy gum-land, but, instead of it, such glorious woods and  jungles and thickets of strange beautiful vegetation. Mile after mile it  is the same, the dense evergreen forest stretching away over the ranges  as far as one can see. Here it is the light bush, woods of young trees  that have grown over what were once the sites of Maori cultivation;  there it is the heavy bush, the real primeval forest.    One great feature of the Kaipara tidal estuary is the quantity of  mangroves. Immense tracts are covered with water at high tide, and are  left bare at low tide. These mud-banks are covered with mangroves in  many places, forming great stretches of uniform thicket. The mangrove is  here a tree growing to a height of twenty or thirty feet, branching  thickly, and bearing a dark, luxuriant foliage. At high water, the  mangrove swamps present the appearance of thickets growing out of the  water. When the tide recedes, their gnarled and twisted stems are laid  bare, often covered with clinging oysters. Below, in the mud, are  boundless stores of pipi (cockles), and other shell-fish and eels.    The channel of the river is broad and deep, but often, to save some  bend, the _Lily_ ploughs her way along natural lanes and arcades among  the mangroves. It is a novel experience to us to glide along the still  reaches among these fluviatile greenwoods. We are embosomed in a  submerged forest, whose trees are uniform in height and kind. All round  us, like a hedge, is the glossy green foliage, sometimes brushing our  boat on either side. And we scare up multitudes of water fowl, unused to  such invasion of their solitudes. Wild duck, teal, grey snipe, shags,  and many kinds that no one on board knows the names of, start from under  our very bows. Not gay plumaged birds, though, for the most part; only  now and then a pair of kingfishers, flashing green and orange as they  fly, or the purple beauty of a pukeko, scuttling away into the depths of  the swamp.    By-and-by we emerge into the expanse of the harbour. Once out in it we  could almost imagine ourselves at sea, for, from the low deck of the  _Lily_, we only see the higher grounds and hill-tops round, looking like  islands in the distance, as we cannot descry the continuity of shore.  And now we have leisure to make closer acquaintance with the boat that  carries us.    The _Lily_ is a queer craft. Though old and rickety, she gets through a  considerable amount of work, and is sufficiently seaworthy to fight a  squall, when that overtakes her in the harbour. Not that a gale is by  any means a light affair, in this wide stretch of water. When one is  blowing, as it sometimes does for two or three days at a time, the  _Lily_ lies snugly at anchor in some sheltered cove, and settlers have  to wait as patiently as may be for their mails or goods. She knows her  deficiencies, and will not face stormy weather, if she can help it.    Three times a week she visits certain of the Kaipara settlements,  returning from them on alternate days. The arrangement is such that each  township gets--or is supposed to get--one weekly visit from her. She is  a boat with a character, or without it, which means about the same thing  in the present instance. She has also a skipper, who is something of a  character in his way.    The Pirate, or Pirate Tom, as he is indifferently called, is a gentleman  of some importance locally, for he is the channel of communication  between the Kaipara settlers and the outside world. He is a man of  ferocious aspect, black-bearded to the eyes, taciturn, and rough in  demeanour. In his hot youth, he is credited with having borne his part  in certain questionable proceedings in the South Sea, and hence his  appellation.    Freights run very high on the _Lily_, and it is by no means certain how  far the Pirate may be concerned in keeping them so. He is apt to be  captious, too, as regards the transit of cargo, and will refuse to do  business if it is his whim, or if any particular individual happen to  offend him; for he is lord paramount over the river traffic, and well  does he know how to turn that to his own advantage. Apparently, he  considers that he does you a personal favour if he carries you or your  goods, and you have to keep on his good books, lest he should not  condescend to do either.    Besides the playful way in which he manipulates the commerce of the  district, Pirate Tom has another mode in which he adds to his gains. At  some of the river townships and stations there is no hotel, or store,  where liquor can be obtained. The only immediate facility that settlers  and bushmen at such places have for procuring it, is such as is afforded  by the boat. The Pirate is always ready to dispense the vile compounds  he call spirits to all comers--sixpence per drink being his price, as it  is the established tariff of the colony. It is held to be manners to ask  him to partake himself, when any one desires to put away a nobbler; and  the Pirate, being an ardent disciple of Bacchus, was never yet known to  refuse any such invitation. He also sells, at seven"]]]
