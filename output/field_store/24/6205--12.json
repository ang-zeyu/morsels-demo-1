Draught cider, light beer, and cold tea  are the best liquors to work on for a long stretch. Do not leave the  sacks behind you, nor cord to secure them with. And finally, reader, if  you are a true sportsman, whilst sparing neither necessary pain to  yourself nor dog during the progress of the siege, do not subject your  terriers to unnecessary exposure and punishment; and when the day's work  is done, however weary and however hungry you may be, do not attend to  your own wants till you have seen each member of your gallant little  pack well brushed and oiled (eyes and ears and wounds, if any, cleaned),  fed, and put into a kennel with plenty of clean bedding. And do not  forget to make a brave foe as comfortable as you can. If you keep a  badger in confinement as a pet, he should have access to plenty of fresh  cold water, and be fed on young rabbits and bread till accustomed to  confinement, after which he will take gradually to and remain healthy on  almost any scraps, meat, and vegetables from the house that you give  him. He requires a dry dark kennel and yard, which should be kept  scrupulously clean, when he will never be offensive. Some badgers take  kindly at once to these new circumstances, others sulk and occasionally  waste and die unless great care is taken. If the badger's evacuations  show a tendency to purging, feed on bread chiefly and rabbit, or if  fastidious in his appetite, give raw eggs and bread.    If by this little book I have done anything towards interesting those  who care about the perpetuation of a wild and interesting animal that  is fast disappearing from our hillsides and valleys, and shown that  healthy exercise and pleasure can be obtained in protecting him from  extinction and by fairly entering the lists against him, I shall have  done something towards delaying that sad day when the last badgers, with  the lessons of courage and endurance that they can teach, have vanished  for ever.

Through his undimmed eyes I had glimpses of those happy shores  whereon the sun always shines and no cloud arises beyond. What a little  way behind they seem in the voyage that has grown wearisome, and yet we  can never revisit them for a day nor for an hour, and it is like a dream  that we ever dwelt there.    Bearing with us from this port something not marketable nor even  visible, yet worth carrying home, we reembarked, and the wind, blowing  in my face, informed me we were homeward bound. One after another, we  passed five boats of fishing parties tied up at as many stakes, the  crews pursuing their pastime with steadfast patience, as their intent  silence proclaimed. To me they were as ships passed in the night. I had  no other knowledge of them than this, except that my friend told me  there was a fat woman in each boat, and that one of them boasted to us,  with motherly pride, of a big pickerel caught by her little girl.    A blended hum of bumblebees droned in among us, and my companions  remarked that one of the aerial voyagers had boarded our craft, while I  maintained there were two, which proved to be the fact; whereupon I  argued that my ears were better than their eyes, but failed to convince  them or even myself. I welcomed the bees as old acquaintances, who, in  the duck-shooting of past years, always used to come aboard and bear us  company for awhile, rarely alighting, but tacking from stem to stern on  a cruise of inspection, till at last, satisfied or disappointed, they  went booming out of sight and hearing over marshfuls of blue spikes of  pickerel weed and white trinities of arrowhead. I cannot imagine why  bees should be attracted to the barrenness of a boat, unless by a  curiosity to explore such strange floating islands, though their dry  wood promises neither leaf nor bloom.    I hear of people every year who forsake leafage and bloom to search the  frozen desolation of the polar north for the Lord knows what, and I  cease to wonder at the bees, when men so waste the summers that are  given them to enjoy if they will but bide in them.    We passed many new houses of the muskrats, who are building close to the  channel this year in prophecy of continued low water. But muskrats are  not infallible prophets, and sometimes suffer therefor in starvation or  drowning. The labor of the night-workers was suspended in the glare of  the August afternoon, and their houses were as silent as if deserted,  though we doubted not there were happy households inside them,  untroubled by dreams of famine or deluge, or possibly of the  unmercifulness of man, though that seems an abiding terror with our  lesser brethren. Winter before last the marshes were frozen to the  bottom, blockading the muskrats in their houses, where entire families  perished miserably after being starved to cannibalism. Some dug out  through the house roofs, and wandered far across the desolate wintry  fields in search of food. Yet nature, indifferent to all fates, has so  fostered them since that direful season that the marshy shores are  populous again with sedge-thatched houses.    As we neared our home port we met two trollers, one of whom lifted up  for envious inspection a lusty pickerel. \"He's as big as your leg,\" my  friend replied to my inquiry concerning its dimensions, and in aid of my  further inquisitiveness asked the lucky captor how much the fish would  weigh. \"Wal, I guess he ought to weigh abaout seven pounds,\" was  answered, after careful consideration. We learned afterwards that its  actual weight was nine pounds, and I set that man down as a very honest  angler.    Presently our boat ran her nose into the familiar mire of well-named Mud  Landing, and we exchanged oars for legs, which we plied with right good  will, for a thunderstorm was beginning to bellow behind us.          XXVII    THE SUMMER CAMP-FIRE      A thin column of smoke seen rising lazily among the leafy trees and  fading to a wavering film in the warm morning air or the hotter breath  of noon, a flickering blaze kindling in the sultry dusk on some quiet  shore, mark the place of the summer camp-fire.    It is not, like the great hospitable flare and glowing coals of the  autumn and winter camp-fires, the centre to which all are drawn, about  which the life of the camp gathers, where joke and repartee flash to and  fro as naturally and as frequently as its own sparks fly upward, where  stories come forth as continuously as the ever-rising volume of smoke.    Rather it is avoided and kept aloof from, held to only by the unhappy  wretch upon whom devolves the task of tending the pot and frying-pan,  and he hovers near it fitfully, like a moth about a candle, now backing  away to mop his hot face, now darting into the torrid circle to turn a  fish or snatch away a seething pot or sizzling pan. Now and then the  curious and hungry approach to note with what skill or speed the cookery  is progressing, but they are content to look on at a respectful distance  and to make suggestions and criticisms, but not to interfere with aid.  The epicurean smoker, who holds that the finest flavor of tobacco is  evoked only by coal or blazing splinter, steals down upon the windward  side and snatches a reluctant ember or an elusive flame that flickers  out on the brink of the pipe bowl, but most who burn the weed are  content now to kindle it with the less fervid flame of a match.    And yet this now uncomfortable necessity is still the heart of the camp,  which without it would be but a halting place for a day, where one  appeases hunger with a cold bite and thirst with draughts of tepid  water, and not a temporary home where man has his own fireside, though  he care not to sit near it, and feasts full on hot viands and refreshes  himself with the steaming cup that cheers but not inebriates.    Its smoke drifted far through the woods may prove a pungent trail,  scented out among the odors of balsams and the perfume of flowers that  shall lead hither some pleasant stranger or unexpected friend, or its  firefly glow, flashing but feebly through the gloaming, may be a beacon  that shall bring such company. In its praise may also be said that the  summer camp-fire demands no laborious feeding nor careful tending, is  always a servant, seldom a master.          XXVIII    THE RACCOON      Summer is past its height. The songless bobolink has forsaken the shorn  meadow. Grain fields, save the battalioned maize, have fallen from  gracefulness and beauty of bending heads and ripple of mimic waves to  bristling acres of stubble. From the thriftless borders of ripening  weeds busy flocks of yellowbirds in faded plumage scatter in sudden  flight at one's approach like upblown flurries of dun leaves. Goldenrod  gilds the fence-corners, asters shine in the dewy borders of the woods,  sole survivors of the floral world save the persistent bloom of the wild  carrot and succory--flourishing as if there had never been mower or  reaper--and the white blossoms of the buckwheat crowning the filling  kernels. The fervid days have grown preceptibly shorter, the lengthening  nights have a chilly autumnal flavor, and in the cool dusk the katydids  call and answer one to another out of their leafy tents, and the  delicate green crickets that Yankee folks call August pipers play their  monotonous tune. Above the katydid's strident cry and the piper's  incessant notes, a wild tremulous whinny shivers through the gloom at  intervals, now from a distant field or wood, now from the near orchard.  One listener will tell you that it is only a little screech owl's voice,  another that it is the raccoon's rallying cry to a raid on the  cornfield. There is endless disputation concerning it and apparently no  certainty, but the raccoon is wilder than the owl, and it is pleasanter  to believe that it is his voice that you hear.    The corn is in the milk; the feast is ready. The father and mother and  well grown children, born and reared in the cavern of a ledge or hollow  tree of a swamp, are hungry for sweets remembered or yet untasted, and  they are gathering to it, stealing out of the thick darkness of the  woods and along the brookside in single file, never stopping to dig a  fiery wake-robin bulb nor to catch a frog nor harry a late brood of  ground-nesting birds, but only to call some laggard, or distant  clansfolk. So one fancies, when the quavering cry is repeated and when  it ceases, that all the free-booters have gained the cornfield and are  silent with busy looting. Next day's examination of the field may  confirm the fancy with the sight of torn and trampled stalks and munched  ears. These are the nights when the coon hunter is abroad and the  robbers' revel is likely to be broken up in a wild panic.    Hunted only at night, to follow the coon the boldest rider must  dismount, yet he who risks neck and limbs, or melts or freezes for  sport's sake, and deems no sport manly that has not a spice of danger or  discomfort in it, must not despise this humble pastime for such reason.    On leaving the highway that leads nearest to the hunting ground, the way  of the coon hunters takes them, in darkness or feeble lantern light,  over rough and uncertain footing, till the cornfield's edge is reached  and the dogs cast off. Away go the hounds, their course only indicated  by the rustling of the corn leaves, as they range through the field,  until one old truth-teller gives tongue on the track of a coon who  perhaps has brought his whole family out on a nocturnal picnic. The  hounds sweep straight away, in full cry, on the hot scent to hill or  swamp, where their steadfast baying proclaims that the game is treed.    Then follows a pell-mell scramble toward the musical uproar. Stones,"]]]
