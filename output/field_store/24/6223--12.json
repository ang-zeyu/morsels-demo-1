He seemed without  fear, but he did not speak a word, and did nothing to encourage us.  Several of our party, in trying to make their way to the palace,  had been murdered, and the mob cut off their heads and put them on  pikes; and these were paraded in the streets within sight of the  windows. Roederer, the procureur-general of the department of Paris,  came to the king and pressed him to leave the Tuileries.    \"'There are not five minutes to lose, sire,' he said. 'There is no  safety for your majesty but in the National Assembly.'    \"The queen resisted; but upon Roederer saying that an enormous  crowd with cannon were coming, and that delay would endanger the  lives of the whole of the royal family, he went. But he thought of  us, and asked what was to become of us. Roederer said that, as we  were not in uniform, by leaving our swords behind us we could pass  through the crowd without being recognized. The king moved on,  followed by the queen, Madam Elizabeth, and the children.  The crowd,  close and menacing, lined the passage, and the little procession  made their way with difficulty to the Assembly.    \"We remained in the palace, and every moment the throng around  became more and more numerous. The cannon they brought were turned  against us. The first door was burst open, the Swiss did not fire,  the populace poured in and mixed with us and the soldiers.  Some  one fired a gun. Whether it was one of the Swiss or one of the mob  I know not, but the fight began. The Swiss in good order marched  down the staircase, drove out the mob, seized the cannon the  Marseillais had brought, and turning them upon their assailants  opened fire. The mob fled in terror, and I believe that one battalion  would have conquered all the scum of Paris, had not the king, at  the sound of the first shot, sent word to the Swiss to cease firing.  They obeyed, and although the mob kept firing upon them from the  windows, the great part of them marched calm, and without returning  a shot, to the Assembly, where, at the order of the king, they laid  down their arms and were shut up in the church of the Feuillants.    \"A portion of the Swiss had remained on guard in the Tuileries when  the main body marched away. The instant the palace was undefended  the mob burst in. Every Swiss was murdered, as well as many of  the servants of the queen. The mob sacked the palace and set it on  fire. When the Swiss left we  had one by one made our way out by a  back entrance, but most of us were recognized by the mob and were  literally cut to pieces. I rushed into a house when assaulted,  and, slamming the door behind me, made my way out by the back and  so escaped them, getting off with only these two wounds; then I  hurried to a house of a friend, whom I had seen murdered before my  eyes, but his servants did not know of it, and they allowed me to  remain there till dark, and you see here I am.\"    \"But what has happened at the Assembly and where is the king?\" the  marquise asked, after the first exclamation of horror at the tale  they had heard.    \"The king and his family are prisoners in the Temple,\" the marquis  said. \"The Commune has triumphed over the Assembly and a National  Convention is to be the supreme power. The king's functions are  suspended, but as he has not ruled for the last three years that  will make little difference.  A new ministry has been formed with  Danton, Lebrun, and some of the Girondists. He and his family are  handed over to the care of the Commune, and their correspondence is  to be intercepted. A revolutionary tribunal has been constituted,  when, I suppose, the farce of trying men whose only crime is loyalty  to the king is to be carried out.    \"We must be prepared, my love, to face the worst. Escape is now  impossible, and, indeed, so long as the king and queen are alive I  would not quit Paris; but we must prepare for sending the children  away if possible.\"          CHAPTER V    The Outburst      \"Monsieur le Marquis,\" M. du Tillet exclaimed, hurrying into the  salon, in which the marquis with his family were sitting, on the  evening of the 21st of August, \"I hear that it is rumoured in the  street that all the members of noble families are to be arrested.\"    The room was lit up as if to receive company, but the crowd which  had thronged it a fortnight before were gone. The Girondists had  first withdrawn, then the nobles had begun to fall off, for it had  become dangerous for them to show themselves in the streets, where  they were liable to be insulted and attacked by the mob. Moreover,  any meeting of known Royalists was regarded with suspicion by the  authorities, and so gradually the gatherings had become smaller  and smaller.    The only constant visitor now was the Count de Gisons, but he  to-night was absent. The news was not unexpected. The violence of  the extremists of the Mountain had been increasing daily. At the  Cordeliers and Jacobin Clubs, Danton, Robespierre, and Marat had  thundered nightly their denunciations against the aristocrats, and  it was certain that at any moment the order for their arrest might  be given. Such bad news had been received of the state of feeling  in the provinces, that it was felt that it would be more dangerous  to send the young ones away than to retain them in Paris, and the  marquise had been a prey to the liveliest anxiety respecting her  children. It seemed impossible that there could be any animosity  against them, but the blind rage of the mob had risen to such a  height that it was impossible to say what might happen. Now that  she heard the blow was about to fall she drew her younger girls  instinctively to her, as if to protect them, but no word passed  her lips.    \"It might still be possible to fly,\" M. du Tillet went on. \"We have  all the disguises in readiness.\"    \"A Marquis de St. Caux does not fly from the canaille of Paris,\"  the marquis said quietly. \"No, Du Tillet; the king and queen are  in prison, and it is not for their friends to leave their post here  in Paris because danger threatens them; come when they may, these  wretches will find us here ready for them.\"    \"But the children, Edouard!\" the marquise murmured.    \"I shall stand by my father's side,\" Ernest said firmly.    \"I do not doubt your courage, my son. I wish now that I had long  ago sent you all across the frontier; but who could have foreseen  that the people of France were about to become a horde of wild  beasts, animated by hate against all, old and young, in whose veins  ran noble blood. However, although it is the duty of your mother  and I to stay at our posts, it is our duty also to try and save  our house from destruction; therefore, Du Tillet, I commit my two  sons to your charge. Save them if you can, disguise them as you will,  and make for the frontier. Once there you know all the arrangements  we have already made.\"    \"But, father,\" Ernest remonstrated.    \"I can listen to no argument, Ernest,\" the marquis said firmly.  \"In this respect my will is law. I know what your feelings are,  but you must set them aside, they must give way to the necessity  of saving one of the oldest families of France from perishing.\"    \"And the girls?\" the marquise asked, as Ernest bent his head in  sign of obedience to his father's orders.    \"I cannot think,\" the marquis said, \"that they will be included in  the order for our arrest. They must go, as arranged, in the morning  to the house of our old servant and remain quietly there awaiting  the course of events. They will pass very well as three of her  nieces who have arrived from the country. You had better send a  trusty servant to prepare her for their coming. You, Harry, will,  of course, accompany my sons.    \"Pardon, marquis,\" Harry said quietly, \"I am firmly resolved to  stay in Paris. I may be of assistance to your daughters, and there  will be no danger to me in remaining, for I have no noble blood in  my veins. Besides, my travelling with M. du  Tillet would add to  his danger. He will have difficulty enough in traversing the country  with two boys; a third would add to that difficulty.\"    \"I cannot help that,\" the marquis said. \"I ought long ago to have  sent you home, and feel that I have acted wrongly in allowing you  to remain so long. I must insist upon your accompanying my sons.\"    \"I am sorry to disobey you, monsieur le marquis,\" Harry said quietly  but firmly; \"but from the moment of your arrest I shall be my own  master and can dispose of my actions. I am deeply sensible of all  your goodness to me, but I cannot yield, for I feel that I may be  of some slight use here. There are so many strangers in Paris that  there is little fear of my attracting any notice. A mouse may help  a lion, monsieur, and it may be that though but a boy I may be able  to be of service to mesdemoiselles.\"    \"Do not urge him further, Edouard,\" the marquise said, laying a  hand on her husband's arm as he was again about to speak. \"Harry  is brave and thoughtful beyond his years, and it will be somewhat  of a comfort to me to think that there is some one watching over  our girls. I thank you, Harry, for your offer, and feel sure that  you will do all that can possibly be done to protect my girls. You  will be freer to do so than any of our friends, for they are likely  to become involved in our fate, whatever that may be. Marie, you  will view our English friend as joint guardian with yourself over  your sisters. Consult him should difficulty or danger arise as if  he were your brother, and be guided by his advice. And now, girls,  come with me to my room, I have much to say to you.    \"I am glad my wife decided as she did, Harry,\" the marquis said,  putting his hand on his shoulder when his wife and daughters left  the room, \"for I too shall feel comfort in knowing that you are  watching over the girls. Now leave us, for I have much to arrange  with Monsieur du Tillet.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],[0,"The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#13)"],[1,"places.    The footwear may be either rubber boots, leather shoes, or rubber  wading trousers. If the water is warm, wear leather shoes, and have  nails put in the thick soles to keep your feet from slipping in swift  water and on slimy stones. If you choose rubber boots see that they  are of the light, thin, thigh-fitting sort and not the clumsy affairs  with straps attached.    The fly-book for use on the stream should have room for not more than  a dozen flies, with pockets for leaders, silk cord, small shears, and  other tools. A larger book for your general stock of flies and leaders  may be left at your rural lodgings with your tackle box and other  traps.    The leader, to which are attached the flies in use, should be of the  finest quality of single silk gut, and in length three feet. Two of  these attached make a cast, though I prefer a longer cast of leader.    The coat and general clothing should be of a dead-grass, gray, or  light brown color. Have plenty of pockets, and tie a string to nearly  everything you carry in them, so you cannot lose them if they fall  from your hands.    The flies--every known variety of trout fly, providing you order these  of the finest make.    Do not undertake to go trouting stintingly equipped, which is not  saying that you are to dress and act like a circus clown. But you must  be properly outfitted. Good carpenters make good houses, but their  work is better and more pleasant if they have good tools.

CHAPTER XII    TROUT FLIES, ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL      \"The wide range of difference between the wet fly and the dry fly lies  in the fact that the wet fly is an imitation of no special thing  active and living, while the dry fly purports to be an imitation of  the natural fly. It is generally a well-known fact that any of our  well-known American wet flies can be converted into exceptionally good  dry flies by giving them an ablution of oil.\"--Robert Page Lincoln,  _Outdoor Life_. September, 1915.    Then the wet fly resembles the dry fly, and therefore the wet fly is  an imitation of the living fly. Of course it is. Is not the artificial  black gnat imitative of the live black gnat? And is not the white  miller artificial fly patterned after the living white miller fly?  Certainly. Mary Orvis Marbury, author of _Favorite Flies_, and  daughter of Charles F. Orvis, one of America's greatest fly-makers,  says so. So says William C. Harris, Seth Green, Frank Forester, Louis  Rhead, A. Nelson Cheney, Frederick Mather, Dr. Henshall, Charles  Hallock, Dean Sage, William C. Prime, Charles Z. Southard, Dr. van  Dyke, Edward Breck, _et al._    All angling writers in discoursing upon artificial flies use the  expressions \"in season,\" \"seasonable flies,\" etc. Now, how could this  or that artificial fly be in season if it were not copied from the  living fly? Of course, there are some artificial flies that are not  copied from nature, but the artificial fly in general is a duplicate  of the living thing. \"When a fly is said to be in season,\" says Alfred  Ronalds, \"it does not follow that it is abroad on every day of its  existence.\" But, our opinions must not be harshly expressed--rather  set forth \"in pleasant discourse,\" as Walton says--for, as Pritt tells  us, \"one of the charms of angling is that it presents an endless field  for argument, speculation, and experiment.\"    After the foregoing excerpt and my comment upon it appeared in the New  York _Press_ (Sept. 11, 1915). I wrote several of the authorities  mentioned, asking their views on the subject, and following will be  found their replies.    Henry van Dyke, author of _Little Rivers_, _Days Off_, _Fisherman's  Luck_, etc.:        For flies as \"wet,\" or flies as \"dry.\"      I do not care a whit--not I!      The natural fly is dry, no doubt.      While through the air he flits about;      But, lighting on the stream, you bet      He very often gets quite wet.      This fact is known to all the fish;      They take their flies just as they wish.      Upon the surface or below.      Precisely _why_ we do not know.      The honest Angler should not be      A man of rigid theory.      But use the most alluring fly.      And sometimes \"wet,\" and sometimes \"dry.\"    Louis Rhead, author of _The Book of Fish and Fishing_: \"After  thirty-two years' active fishing for trout, beginning with a worm as a  bait, I have developed through various stages to know fish with  nothing but my own nature flies. I have made careful color pictures of  all the most abundant insects and produced flies tied to exactly  imitate them. Many insects do not and cannot float, yet an imitation  can be made of them to fish wet. The English dry fly is not of  necessity a copy of the natural insect. Halford has many fancy dry  flies that are not copies of insects. Nearly all American commercial  trout flies are fancy flies, and do not imitate insects. To be exact,  in fishing with a floating fly it is only right to use copies of  insects that will float, mostly drakes. The average Angler has been  sadly fooled by this so-called dry-fly fishing, and books have been  written (mostly culled from British sources), making Anglers more  bewildered than ever.\"    Charles Zibeon Southard, author of _Trout Fly-Fishing in America_: \"In  reply to your question about trout flies, 'Am I right?' I would say  that unquestionably you are. From the earliest days of trout  fly-fishing it has been the intention of Anglers to have their flies  resemble as far as possible the natural ones found upon their trout  waters. One has only to read dear old Izaak Walton and the many noted  fly-fishing authorities that have followed to the present day to be  convinced of your view. Of course the art of fly-tying has advanced  with mighty strides during the past fifteen years and more especially  during the past ten years, and to the makers of 'dry' flies for the  wonderful development of the artificial fly too much credit, in my  judgment, cannot be given. That wet flies are not such remarkable  imitations of the natural flies as are the dry flies goes almost  without saying. As a matter of fact it is not the question which fly  is the better imitation, but that both the wet fly and the dry fly are  patterned, in most cases, after the natural flies. From the time of  Walton and before that, wet flies have been patterned after natural  flies. In many instances nowadays wet flies are not designed to  represent natural flies, but such flies are freaks, are short-lived,  and are seldom used by real trout fly-fishermen. There is no doubt in  my mind that taken as a whole wet flies have been intended to  represent natural flies, but quite often in the past and in the  present day have not been and are not good imitations. As the art of  fly-tying has advanced, more nearly do the artificial represent the  natural flies, and this advancement is due, in a great measure, to the  makers of dry flies. Speaking from a practical standpoint, the  so-called dry flies are the very best wet flies obtainable, and on  most American trout waters more trout will be caught on them when  fished wet than when fished dry, especially the _fontinalis_.\"    Dr. James A. Henshall, author of _The Book of the Black Bass_:  \"Regarding the 'Trout Flies' clipping sent me for comment I think the  mention of my name in it is sufficient without adding anything more.\"    Dr. Edward Breck, author of _The Way of the Woods_, etc.: \"I suppose  that I may subscribe to your paragraph in answer to Mr. Lincoln. We  old chaps all know that laying down any hard and fast rules for trout  is a futile undertaking; there are so many exceptions, and _les  extremes se touchent_ so very often. Many wet flies are certainly not  imitations of natural flies nor are they meant to be; as, for example,  the Parmachenee belle, which they say Wells fashioned to imitate the  belly-fin of a trout, always known to be a killing lure.  'Non-university' trout grab anything that looks like food, whether it  has the appearance of an insect or something else. The more educated  fish of the more southern waters may make finer distinctions. It is a  vast subject, and as many authorities may be found for almost any  statement as for the several pronunciations of the word 'Byzantine.'  You remember the scoffing English Angler who dyed his dry flies blue  and red and took a lot of fish with them, to the scandal of the  purists! The charm of the whole thing is precisely that there are no  rules. It is like style in writing English. Every man makes his own.  Whether it is more pleasing in the sight of Saint Izaak to wait for a  fish to begin feeding before casting over him, or for a man to sally  forth, and, by dint of knowledge and patience and skill, actually make  the trout rise to his lure, what arrogant mortal shall judge?\"    Robert Page Lincoln: \"Perhaps I should have said _some_ wet flies are  an imitation of no special object connected with living things.
