In this Mother Crow had laid her five bluish-green eggs marked with  brown; and she and Father Crow had shared, turn and turn about, the long  task of keeping their babies inside those beautiful shells warm enough  so that they could grow.    And grow they did, into five as homely little objects as ever broke  their way out of good-looking eggshells. There was not down on their  bodies to make them fluffy and pretty, like Peter Piper's children. They  were just sprawling little bits of crow-life, so helpless that it would  have been quite pitiful if they had not had a good patient mother and a  father who seemed never to get tired of hunting for food.    Now, it takes a very great deal of food for five young crows, because  each one on some days will eat more than half his own weight and beg for  more. Dear, dear! how they did beg! Every time either Father or Mother  Crow came back to the nest, those five beaks would open so wide that the  babies seemed to be yawning way down to the end of their red throats.  Oh, the food that got stuffed into them! Good and nourishing, every bit  of it; for a proper diet is as important to a bird baby as to a human  one. Juicy caterpillars--a lot of them: enough to eat up a whole  berry-patch if the crows hadn't found them; nutty-flavored  grasshoppers--a lot of them, too; so many, in fact, that it looked very  much as if crows were the reason the grasshoppers were so nearly wiped  out that year that they didn't have a chance to trouble the farmers'  crops; and now and then a dainty egg was served them in the most  tempting crow-fashion, that is, right from the beak of the parent.    For, as you no doubt have heard, a crow thinks no more of helping  himself to an egg of a wild bird than we do of visiting the nests of  tame birds, such as hens and geese and turkeys, and taking the eggs they  lay. Of course, it would not occur to a crow that he didn't have a  perfect right to take such food for himself and his young as he could  find in his day's hunting. Indeed, it is not unlikely that, if a crow  did any real thinking about the matter, he might decide that robins and  meadowlarks were his chickens anyway. So what the other birds would  better do about it is to hide their nests as well as ever they can, and  be quiet when they come and go.    That is the way Father and Mother Crow did, themselves, when they built  their home where the pine boughs hid it from climbers below and from  fliers above. And, though you might hardly believe it of a crow, they  were still as mice whenever they came near it, alighting first on trees  close by, and slipping up carefully between the branches, to be sure no  enemy was following their movements. Then they would greet their babies  with a comforting low \"Caw,\" which seemed to mean, \"Never fear, little  ones, we've brought you a very good treat.\" Yes, they were shy, those  old crows, when they were near their home, and very quiet they kept  their affairs until their young got into the habit of yelling, \"Kah,  kah, kah,\" at the top of their voices whenever they were hungry, and of  mumbling loudly, \"Gubble-gubble-gubble,\" whenever they were eating.    After that time comes, there is very little quiet within the home of a  crow; and all the world about may guess, without being a bit clever,  where the nest is. A good thing it is for the noisy youngsters that by  that time they are so large that it does not matter quite so much.    But it was before the \"kah-and-gubble\" habit had much more than begun  that Corbie was adopted; and the nestlings were really as still as could  be when the father of the Brown-eyed Boy and the Blue-eyed Girl climbed  way, way, way up that big tree and looked into the round little room up  there. There was no furniture--none at all. Just one bare nursery, in  which five babies were staying day and night. Yet it was a tidy room,  fresh and sweet enough for anybody to live in; for a crow, young or old,  is a clean sort of person.    The father of the Brown-eyed Boy and the Blue-eyed Girl looked over the  five homely, floundering little birds, and, choosing Corbie, put him  into his hat and climbed down with him. He was a nimble sort of father,  or he never could have done it, so tall a tree it was, with no branches  near the ground.    Corbie, even at ten days old, was not like the spry children of Peter  Piper, who could run about at one day old, all ready for picnics and  teetering along the shore. No, indeed! He was almost as helpless and  quite as floppy as a human baby, and he needed as good care, too. He  needed warmth enough and food enough and a clean nest to live in; and he  needed to be kept safe from such prowling animals as will eat young  birds, and from other enemies. All these things his father and mother  had looked out for.    Now the little Corbie was kidnaped--taken away from his home and the  loving and patient care of his parents.    But you need not be sorry for Corbie--not very. For the Brown-eyed Boy  and the Blue-eyed Girl adopted the little chap, and gave him food enough  and warmth enough and a chance to keep his new nest clean; and they did  it all with love and patience, too.    Corbie kept them busy, for they were quick to learn that, when he opened  his beak and said, \"Kah,\" it was meal-time, even if he had had luncheon  only ten minutes before. His throat was very red and very hollow, and  seemed ready to swallow no end of fresh raw egg and bits of raw beef and  earthworms and bread soaked in milk. Not that he had to have much at a  time, but he needed so very many meals a day. It was fun to feed the  little fellow, because he grew so fast and because he was so comical  when he called, \"Kah.\"    It was not long before his body looked as if he had a crop of  paint-brushes growing all over it; for a feather, when it first comes,  is protected by a little case, and the end of the feather, which sticks  out of the tip of the case, does look very much like the soft hairs at  the end of a paint-brush, the kind that has a hollow quill stem, you  know. After they were once started, dear me, how those feathers grew! It  seemed no time at all before they covered up the ear-holes in the side  of his head, and no time at all before a little bristle fringe grew down  over the nose-holes in his long horny beak.    He was nearly twenty days old before he could stand up on his toes like  a grown-up crow. Before that, when he stood up in his nest and \"kahed\"  for food, he stood on his whole foot way back to the heel, which looks  like a knee, only it bends the wrong way. When he was about three weeks  old, however, he began standing way up on his toes, and stretching his  leg till his heels came up straight. Then he would flap his wings and  exercise them, too.    Of course, you can guess what that meant. It meant--yes, it meant that  Corbie was getting ready to leave his nest; and before the Brown-eyed  Boy and the Blue-eyed Girl really knew what was happening, Corbie went  for his first ramble. He stepped out of his nest-box, which had been  placed on top of a flat, low shed, and strolled up the steep roof of the  woodshed, which was within reach. There he stood on the ridge-pole, the  little tike, and yelled, \"Caw,\" in almost a grown-up way, as if he felt  proud and happy. Perhaps he did for a while. It really was a trip to be  proud of for one's very first walk in the world.    But the exercise made him hungry, and he soon yelled, \"Kah!\" in a tone  that meant, \"Bring me my luncheon this minute or I'll beg till you do.\"    The Brown-eyed Boy took a dish of bread and milk to the edge of the low  roof, where the nest-box had been placed, and the Blue-eyed Girl called,  \"Come and get it, Corbie.\"    Not Corbie! He had always had his meals brought to him. He liked  service, that crow. And besides, maybe he _couldn't_ walk down the roof  it had been so easy to run up. Anyway, his voice began to sound as if he  were scared as well as hungry, and later as if he were more scared than  hungry.    Now it stood to reason that Corbie's meals could not be served him every  fifteen minutes on the ridge-pole of a steep roof. So the long ladder  had to be brought out, and the crow carried to the ground and advised to  keep within easy reach until he could use his wings.    It was only a few days until Corbie could fly down from anything he  could climb up; and from that hour he never lacked for amusement. Of  course, the greedy little month-old baby found most of his fun for a  while in being fed. \"Kah! Kah! Kah!\" he called from sun-up to sun-down,  keeping the Brown-eyed Boy and the Blue-eyed Girl busy digging  earthworms and cutworms and white grubs, and soaking bread in milk for  him. \"Gubble-gubble-gubble,\" he said as he swallowed it--it was all so  very good.    [Illustration: _\"Kah! Kah! Kah!\" he called from sun-up to sun-down._]    The joke of it was that Corbie, even then, had a secret--his first one.  He had many later on. But the very first one seems the most wonderful,  somehow. Yes, he could feed himself long before he let his foster  brother and sister know it; and I think, had he been a wild crow instead  of a tame one, he would have fooled his own father and mother the same  way--the little rascal.    No one would think, to see him with beak up and open, and with  fluttering wings held out from his sides, that the little chap begging  \"Kah! kah! kah!\" was old enough to do more than \"gubble\" the food that  was poked into his big throat. But for all that, when the Brown-eyed Boy  forgot the dish of earthworms and ran off to play, Corbie would listen  until he could hear no one near, and then cock his bright eye down over  the wriggling worms. Then, very slyly, he would pick one up with a jerk  and catch it back into his mouth. One by one he would eat the worms,  until he wanted no more; and then he would hide the rest by poking them  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2563"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#13)"],[1,"at all the notaries, and  amongst all the registers of the parishes for the proof of my marriage;  that he warned us to be on our guard, and that whatever diligence he  might be desired to employ, he should do nothing without informing us.  We felt the obligation of this proceeding, and my brother-in-law thanked  the attorney-general in my name as well as in his own. He told him that  it was not at Toulouse that the parties interested should make their  researches for my marriage certificate, but at Paris, either at the  parish church of Saint Laurent, or at the notary's, Lepot d'Auteuil. M.  de Bonrepos gave part of this reply to the duchesse de Grammont. Great  was the bustle amongst the Choiseuls! I leave you to judge of the  fury of the lady or ladies, for the contesse de Grammont was no less  irritated than the other, always prepossessed with the idea, that to  please the king was to wrong their family. The comtesse de Grammont had  not half the talent of the duchesse, she had only her faults. She  showed herself so rude and impertinent towards me, that I was at length  compelled, not to exile her of my own accord, but to allow that she  should be so served. But I anticipate, for this did not occur until the  following year.    The king by all his kindnesses endeavored to recompense me for these  attacks: he appeared charmed to see me surrounded by my husband's  family. He placed amongst the pages the vicomte Adolphe du Barry, son of  comte Jean, a young man of great promise, but whose destiny was so brief  and so unfortunate. My husband's family testified much affection for  me, as did the duc d'Aiguillon, to whom I daily attached myself. He  carefully kept from me all that could give me pain, and took a thousand  precautions that no unpleasant reports should reach me. If we passed a  short time without meeting he wrote to me, and I confess I was delighted  with a correspondence which formed my own style. Mademoiselle Chon, my  sister-in-law, and I also wrote to each other, and that from one room to  another. I remember that one day, having broken a glass of rock crystal  which she had given me, I announced my misfortune in such solemn style,  and with so well feigned a tone of chagrin, that the letter amused the  whole family. The king saw it, and was so much pleased that he kept it,  and next day sent me a golden goblet enriched with stones, which I gave  to Chon, to whom it rightfully belonged.        CHAPTER VI           Journey to Choisy--The comtesse du Barry and Louis XV--The       king of Denmark--The czar Peter--Frederick II--The abbe de       la Chapelle--An experiment--New intrigues--Secret agents-The       comtesse and Louis XV--Of the presentation--Letter of the       comtesse to the duc d'Aiguillon--Reply--Prince de Soubise    Up to this period I had resided constantly at Versailles or Paris,  according to the pleasure of the king, but had never followed his  majesty in any of his journeys. He wished to pass some days at his  delightful chateau at Choisy, situated on the banks of the Seine. It was  decided that I should be of the party, taking the name of the baroness  de Pamklek, a German lady, as that would save me from the embarrassment  in which I should be placed with the king in consequence of my  non-presentation. The prince de Soubise, the ducs de la Trimoulle,  d'Ayen, d'Aiguillon, and the marquis de Chauvelin, were also to attend  the king. The king remained nearly the whole time with me, and the  _entree_ to my apartment became a favor not accorded to every body.  A small committee met there, and talked of every thing except what is  rational; and I can assure you that with such conversation time passes  very quickly.    One day the king entered my apartment holding in his hand a letter.    \"I am about to receive,\" said he, \"a visit that will not give me much  pleasure. My brother of Denmark is traversing Europe, and is about  to come to France. _Mon Dieu_! what inconvenient persons are your  travelling kings! Why do they leave their kingdoms? I think they are  very well at home.\"    \"Yes, sire, but there is an excuse for them: they are weary of admiring  your majesty at a distance, and wish for the happiness of knowing you.\"    At this compliment the king rubbed his hands with a smile, which he  always did when he was satisfied, and then said,    \"There is not in the hearts of foreign potentates the same affection  towards my person as you feel. It is not me but France they wish to see.  I remember that when very young I received a visit from the czar Peter  the Great, Peter the First I mean to say. He was not deficient in sense,  but yet behaved like a boor: he passed his time in running over the  academies, libraries, and manufactories: I never saw such an ill-bred  man. Imagine him embracing me at our first interview, and carrying me in  his arms as one of my valets would have done. He was dirty, coarse,  and ill-dressed. Well, all the Frenchmen ran after him; one would  have supposed by their eagerness that they had never seen a regal  countenance.\"    \"Yet there was no occasion to run very far to see the handsome face of a  king.\"    \"Hold your tongue, madame la baronne de Pamklek, you are a flatterer.  There is a crowned head which for thirty years has desired to visit  France, but I have always turned a deaf ear, and will resist it as long  as possible.\"    \"Who, sire, is the king so unfortunate as to banished by you from your  majesty's presence?\"    \"Who? The king of philosophers, the rival of Voltaire, my brother of  Prussia. Ah, my dear baronne, he is a bad fellow; he detests me, and I  have no love for him. A king does wisely, certainly, to submit his works  to the judgment of a Freron! It would be outrageous scandal if he came  here. Great and small would crowd around him, and there would not be  twenty persons in my train.\"    \"Ah! sire, do you think so?\"    \"I am sure of it. The French now-a-days do not care for their kings,  and _la Fronde_ will be renewed at an early day. After all, philosophers  believe that Frederick II protects them: the honest man laughs both at  them and me.\"    \"At you, sire? Impossible.\"    \"No, no; I know the impertinences he is guilty of towards me: but let  him. I prefer making my court to the pretty women of my kingdom instead  of to my pages. You may depend upon it that if he came to Versailles he  would debauch some of them.\"    The king, charmed at having said this malicious speech, rubbed his hands  again.    \"Really, sire,\" I replied, \"I am astonished that this prince, having  such disgusting inclinations, can have much _eclat_ attached to his  name.\"    \"Ah, that is because he has great qualities: he will not allow himself  to be cheated. Do you know that he is acquainted with the disposal of  his finances to the last farthing?\"    \"Sire, he must be a miser.\"    \"No, madame, he is a man of method. But enough of him. As to his majesty  of Denmark, altho' he would have been as welcome to stay at home, I  shall receive him with as much attention as possible. The kings of  Denmark and Sweden are my natural allies.\"    The king changed the subject, and said, \"There is an abbe, named la  Chapelle, whom I think half cracked. He flatters himself that he can,  thro' the medium of some apparatus, remain on the water without sinking.  He begs my permission to exhibit his experiment before me; and if it  would amuse you, we will have the exhibition to-morrow.\" I accepted the  king's proposal with pleasure.    On the next day we went in a body to the terrace of the chateau. The  king was near me with his hat in his hand; the duc de Duras gave me his  arm. M. l' abbe waited us in a boat: he flung himself bodily into the  water, dressed in a sort of cork-jacket, moved in any direction in the  water, drank, ate, and fired off a gun. So far all went off well, but  the poor abbe, to close the affair, wrote a letter to the king. The  letter was carried in great pomp to his majesty. It contained two verses  of Racine, which had some double allusion to the experiment. This, you  may be sure, was interpreted in the worst manner. The duc d'Ayen gave  the finishing stroke to the whole, on his opinion being asked by the  king.    \"Sire,\" said he, \"such men ought to be thrown into the water; but all we  can wish for them is, that they should remain there.\"    The abbe was not more fortunate in the evening. He presented himself at  supper, but the king did not address a word to him, and he was compelled  to bear the malicious jokes of the courtiers. But let us leave Choisy  and the experimentalist, and return to Versailles and myself.    My friends were excessively desirous for my presentation, which would  decide my position at the chateau. As yet I only had an equivocal  existence, having rank neither at play, theatre, or public festival; so  that if the king should be capricious I could be dismissed as one of  the demoiselles of the _Parc-aux-Cerfs_. The duc d'Aiguillon, whose  attachment to me increased, calculated accurately all the advantages of  this presentation. It would place me on the same footing with madame de  Pompadour, and compel the ministers to come and work with me. The duke  did not doubt but that M. de Choiseul would refuse to pay his _devoirs_  to me, and that his resistance would lead to his fall. But for my  presentation, it was necessary not only that the king should consent,  for of that I was certain, but that he should desire it, and his desire  could not be depended on.    Louis XV was excessively timid: with an air which appeared of a  dreadnaught quality, he was fearful at heart. The clamors of Versailles  kept him in alarm; and he kept at his own court and at foreign courts  secret agents, whose only care was to report to him the complaints  of the people and the sarcasms and satires of society. The king was  attached to them; and when the force of circumstances compelled him to  abandon them, he still supported them"]]]
