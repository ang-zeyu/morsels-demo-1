Rinse well again in  cold water, and dry thoroughly with a clean towel. Season a pint of rich  milk well with pepper and salt. Season the crabs also, lay them in the  milk, rubbing them so that it may impregnate them throughout. Take out,  roll in sifted flour, patting lightly as you roll, then shaking free of  loose flour. Have deep fat, very hot--it must be deep enough to swim the  crabs. Drop them in gently, fry to a delicate brown, skim out, drain on  hot spongy paper, and serve garnished with fried parsley, and sliced  lemon. Serve with Tartare sauce.    _Daube: Otherwise Beef a la Mode_: Take five pounds good lean beef, rump  or top round, and lard it with a quarter pound salt pork or fat bacon,  cut in thin strips and season highly with salt, pepper, onion, garlic,  thyme, parsley, and bay leaves, all minced fine. Crowd in the seasoning  as well as the larding strips. Make the cuts for larding three to four  inches long. Cut two large, mild onions in quarters, and put into a  deep saucepan with a tablespoonful of lard, let them brown well, then  lay upon them the larded beef, cover, and let simmer very slowly till  well browned. When browned add five carrots and two turnips cut into  inch-squares, and two more onions chopped fine. Keep covered tight, and  simmer for ten minutes, then turn over the meat, and brown the other  side--it will take about ten minutes more. Then cover the meat with  boiling water, or weak stock, add a glass of sherry or Madeira, or even  claret, season with salt, black pepper, and Cayenne to taste, then cover  the pot tight, set it where it will barely simmer and let smother for  three hours. The meat should be very tender. Serve hot or cold.    _Cold Daube a la Creole_: Lard, season, and cook, three pounds of rump  or round as above directed, but keep it simmering four hours instead of  three. Put into a deep dish rather large and pour over it a sauce made  thus: Put a two-pound veal steak and two well-cleaned pigsfeet, in a  pot with, four quarts of water, after seasoning them well with salt,  pepper and Cayenne. Add half a clove garlic, bay leaf, sprig thyme, one  onion, all minced fine, also two cloves pounded, and a glass of sherry  or Madeira. Keep boiling till the meat falls from the bones--take up  then, remove bones, mince the meat fine, season it highly and return to  the liquor, stirring it well through. Pour over the beef, let stand  uncovered in a very cool place to harden. Serve in very thin slices--it  will be like jelly. This is a cold-weather dish, as even an ice-box will  not harden the sauce properly in summer.    _Grillades with Gravy_: Flatten by beating a good round steak, and cut  into four-inch-squares. Season the squares highly with salt, pepper, and  Cayenne. Put a heaping tablespoon of lard in a frying pan--as it melts,  add a chopped onion, a clove of garlic also chopped, and as these brown,  one tablespoonful of flour, stirring all smooth. Next add two sliced  tomatoes with their juice--when they brown, lay the grillades upon them.  Cover close, let them brown on one side, then turn and brown the other.  Then add half a tablespoonful of vinegar, and a cup of water. Stir well,  then set where it will simmer for half an hour. Fine for breakfast with  hominy or rice.    Another way is to cook the grillades without garlic, and add to them  along with the tomatoes half a pint of tender okra well washed and  sliced. Or they can be fried brown, in clear fat, then put in a hot dish  over boiling water while a gravy is made of fresh fat, heated very hot,  and stirred about the pan to take up the brown meat essence, a chopped  onion, two sliced tomatoes, a tablespoonful flour, as much vinegar and  water. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and Cayenne, boil ten to  twelve minutes and pour over the grillades.    _Chicken Saute a la Creole_: Clean, singe and cut in joints two spring  chickens, dividing the breasts lengthwise, and cutting drumsticks from  thighs. Season well with salt and pepper. Melt in a frying pan two large  tablespoonfuls butter, add the chicken, and let it brown slowly for  five minutes. Have three large onions sliced thin--add them and let  brown but take care not to scorch in the least. Dredge in two  tablespoonfuls flour, and let it brown. Then put in half a dozen large  tomatoes peeled and sliced, let them brown but cook slowly, letting the  pan barely simmer. Add chopped parsley, thyme and bay leaf, also two  cloves of garlic finely minced, and if you have them, half a dozen sweet  green peppers, freed of seed and cut in shreds. Stir well, cover and let  smother for twenty minutes, stirring now and then, but keeping the pan  covered. Add a cup of consomme if in hand, otherwise a cup of boiling  water, cook very slowly a full half hour, seasoning to taste. After  seasoning, cook ten minutes longer. Serve very hot.    _Roasted Quail_: Take six quail, fat, fresh and tender, pick, draw,  singe, and wipe with a damp cloth inside and out. Butter inside, and  sprinkle with salt and pepper lightly. Butter all over the outside,  truss, and bind around with a thin slice of fat bacon. Put a  tablespoonful of butter in the roasting pan, fit in the quail, and  roast in a hot oven twenty to thirty minutes, according to size. Put six  slices of hot buttered toast in a hot dish, and lay a quail on each. Add  half a spoonful of butter, a little boiling water, and the juice of a  lemon to the gravy in the pan, cook three to four minutes, stirring  well, strain, set back on stove to cook two minutes longer, then pour  evenly upon the breasts of the birds so it will soak in the toast.  Garnish with sliced lemon and watercress, and serve with green grape  jelly. If grape leaves are to be had, wrap the birds in them instead of  bacon, after preparing as directed, roast, take up on toast, garnish  with fresh young grape leaves, and serve with either spiced grapes or  grape jelly.    _Creole French Dressing_: Put three tablespoonfuls of olive oil in a  deep, small bowl, add to it a saltspoon salt and half one of  pepper--more if taste approves. Add alternately drop by drop, a  teaspoonful of made mustard, and a tablespoonful vinegar. When well  mixed, add the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, mashed very smooth, and stir  until blended. Serve with lettuce, celery or potato salad.    _Mayonnaise Dressing_: Chill a small bowl, also a fresh egg, and your  salad oil. Put the yolk of the egg in the bowl--which if it is summer,  should sit in cracked ice. Add drop by drop chilled oil, working it in  as you drop it. When you have added a spoonful begin dropping in lemon  juice, working it likewise into the yolk. It will harden the egg--stir  till very hard, then add more oil, drop by drop, working it in with a  fork. Repeat, until you have used the juice of half a lemon, and two  gills of oil. When the egg begins to curdle add salt and pepper to  taste--but do not put them in until the last. Keep and serve very cold.    _Remoulade Dressing_: Put three hard boiled egg-yolks into a bowl, mash  smooth, add to them half a teaspoonful made mustard, one tablespoonful  Tarragon vinegar, with salt and Cayenne to taste. Next add, drop by  drop, three tablespoonfuls olive oil, after which put in the yolk of a  raw egg, and stir until light. Finish with the juice of half a lemon,  added very gradually. Much depends on the mixing--if hurried or  carelessly done, the sauce will curdle. This is standard for cold meat  of every sort, also heavy salads, and fish.    _Drip Coffee_: Two things are essential--an absolutely clean urn, and  sound coffee, freshly parched, and ground neither too fine nor too  coarse. The water must be freshly boiled. Put a cup of ground coffee in  the strainer, pour upon it about two tablespoonfuls of boiling water,  let it stand until the water drips through and there is no more  bubbling, then pour on more water, but not too much, let it drip,  keeping both the strainer and the spout covered to prevent the loss of  aroma. Repeat until you have used almost five cups of water--this for  four cups of strained coffee, as the grounds hold part of the water.  Keep the pot hot while the dripping goes on, but never where the coffee  will boil. If it dyes the cups it is too strong, but beware of making  too weak.    _Bruleau_: Put into the special bruleau bowl, which has its own brandy  ladle, three ladlefuls of brandy, along with the yellow peel of half an  orange, a dozen cloves, a stick of cinnamon, a few grains of alspice and  six lumps of sugar. Let stand several hours to extract the essential  oils. At serving time put in an extra ladleful of brandy for every  person to be served, and two lumps of domino sugar. Pour alcohol in the  tray underneath the bowl, light it, and stir the brandy back and forth  until it also catches from the flame below. Let burn two or three  minutes--if the lights have been extinguished as they should be, the  effect is beautifully spectral. After the three minutes pour in strong,  hot, clear, black coffee, a small cupful for each person, keep stirring  until the flame dies out, then serve literally blazing hot. This \"burnt  water\" known in more sophisticated regions as _Cafe Diabolique_,  originated in New Orleans, and is the consummate flowering of Creole  cookery.          [Illustration: _Cakes, Great and Small_]      The very queen among cake makers sums her secret of success in a  sentence: \"The best of everything.\" Cake will never be better than the  things whereof it is made, no matter how skilled the maker. But it can  be, and too often is, dismally worse, thus involving a waste of heaven's  good gifts of sugar, butter, eggs, flour and flavors. Having the best at  hand, use it well.

Sif, the Golden-haired    Sif, Thor's wife, was very vain of a magnificent head of long golden  hair which covered her from head to foot like a brilliant veil; and  as she too was a symbol of the earth, her hair was said to represent  the long grass, or the golden grain covering the Northern harvest  fields. Thor was very proud of his wife's beautiful hair; imagine  his dismay, therefore, upon waking one morning, to find her shorn,  and as bald and denuded of ornament as the earth when the grain has  been garnered, and nothing but the stubble remains! In his anger,  Thor sprang to his feet, vowing he would punish the perpetrator  of this outrage, whom he immediately and rightly conjectured to be  Loki, the arch-plotter, ever on the look-out for some evil deed to  perform. Seizing his hammer, Thor went in search of Loki, who attempted  to evade the irate god by changing his form. But it was all to no  purpose; Thor soon overtook him, and without more ado caught him by  the throat, and almost strangled him ere he yielded to his imploring  signs and relaxed his powerful grip. When he could draw his breath,  Loki begged forgiveness, but all his entreaties were vain, until he  promised to procure for Sif a new head of hair, as beautiful as the  first, and as luxuriant in growth.          \"And thence for Sif new tresses I'll bring        Of gold, ere the daylight's gone,      So that she shall liken a field in spring,        With its yellow-flowered garment on.\"                The Dwarfs, Oehlenschlaeger (Pigott's tr.).      Then Thor consented to let the traitor go; so Loki rapidly crept down  into the bowels of the earth, where Svart-alfa-heim was situated,  to beg the dwarf Dvalin to fashion not only the precious hair, but  a present for Odin and Frey, whose anger he wished to disarm.    His request was favourably received and the dwarf fashioned the spear  Gungnir, which never failed in its aim, and the ship Skidbladnir,  which, always wafted by favourable winds, could sail through the air  as well as on the water, and which had this further magic property,  that although it could contain the gods and all their steeds, it  could be folded up into the very smallest compass and thrust in  one's pocket. Lastly, he spun the finest golden thread, from which  he fashioned the hair required for Sif, declaring that as soon as it  touched her head it would grow fast there and become as her own.          \"Though they now seem dead, let them touch but her head,        Each hair shall the life-moisture fill;      Nor shall malice nor spell henceforward prevail        Sif's tresses to work aught of ill.\"                The Dwarfs, Oehlenschlaeger (Pigott's tr.).      Loki was so pleased with these proofs of the dwarfs' skill that he  declared the son of Ivald to be the most clever of smiths--words which  were overheard by Brock, another dwarf, who exclaimed that he was sure  his brother Sindri could produce three objects which would surpass  those which Loki held, not only in intrinsic value, but also in magical  properties. Loki immediately challenged the dwarf to show his skill,  wagering his head against Brock's on the result of the undertaking.    Sindri, apprised of the wager, accepted Brock's offer to blow the  bellows, warning him, however, that he must work persistently and  not for a moment relax his efforts if he wished him to succeed; then  he threw some gold in the fire, and went out to bespeak the favour  of the hidden powers. During his absence Brock diligently plied the  bellows, while Loki, hoping to make him pause, changed himself into  a gadfly and cruelly stung his hand. In spite of the pain, the dwarf  kept on blowing, and when Sindri returned, he drew out of the fire  an enormous wild boar, called Gullin-bursti, because of its golden  bristles, which had the power of radiating light as it flitted across  the sky, for it could travel through the air with marvellous velocity.          \"And now, strange to tell, from the roaring fire        Came the golden-haired Gullinboerst,      To serve as a charger the sun-god Frey,        Sure, of all wild boars this the first.\"                The Dwarfs, Oehlenschlaeger (Pigott's tr.).      This first piece of work successfully completed, Sindri flung some more  gold on the fire and bade his brother resume blowing, while he again  went out to secure magic assistance. This time Loki, still disguised  as a gadfly, stung the dwarf on his cheek; but in spite of the pain  Brock worked on, and when Sindri returned, he triumphantly drew  out of the flames the magic ring Draupnir, the emblem of fertility,  from which eight similar rings dropped every ninth night.          \"They worked it and turned it with wondrous skill,        Till they gave it the virtue rare,      That each thrice third night from its rim there fell        Eight rings, as their parent fair.\"                The Dwarfs, Oehlenschlaeger (Pigott's tr.).      Now a lump of iron was cast in the flames, and with renewed caution not  to forfeit their success by inattention, Sindri passed out, leaving  Brock to ply the bellows as before. Loki was now in desperation  and he prepared for a final effort. This time, still in the guise  of the gadfly, he stung the dwarf above the eye until the blood  began to flow in such a stream, that it prevented his seeing what  he was doing. Hastily raising his hand for a second, Brock dashed  aside the stream of blood; but short as was the interruption it had  worked irreparable harm, and when Sindri drew his work out of the  fire he uttered an exclamation of disappointment for the hammer he  had fashioned was short in the handle.          \"Then the dwarf raised his hand to his brow for the smart,        Ere the iron well out was beat,      And they found that the haft by an inch was too short,        But to alter it then 'twas too late.\"                The Dwarfs, Oehlenschlaeger (Pigott's tr.).      Notwithstanding this mishap, Brock was sure of winning the wager and  he did not hesitate to present himself before the gods in Asgard,  where he gave Odin the ring Draupnir, Frey the boar Gullin-bursti,  and Thor the hammer Mioelnir, whose power none could resist.    Loki in turn gave the spear Gungnir to Odin, the ship Skidbladnir to  Frey, and the golden hair to Thor; but although the latter immediately  grew upon Sif's head and was unanimously declared more beautiful than  her own locks had ever been, the gods decreed that Brock had won  the wager, on the ground that the hammer Mioelnir, in Thor's hands,  would prove invaluable against the frost giants on the last day.                  \"And at their head came Thor,      Shouldering his hammer, which the giants know.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).      In order to save his head, Loki fled precipitately, but was overtaken  by Thor, who brought him back and handed him over to Brock, telling  him, however, that although Loki's head was rightfully his, he  must not touch his neck. Hindered from obtaining full vengeance,  the dwarf determined to punish Loki by sewing his lips together,  and as his sword would not pierce them, he borrowed his brother's  awl for the purpose. However, Loki, after enduring the gods' gibes  in silence for a little while, managed to cut the string and soon  after was as loquacious as ever.    In spite of his redoubtable hammer, Thor was not held in dread as  the injurious god of the storm, who destroyed peaceful homesteads  and ruined the harvest by sudden hail-storms and cloud-bursts. The  Northmen fancied he hurled it only against ice giants and rocky walls,  reducing the latter to powder to fertilise the earth and make it  yield plentiful fruit to the tillers of the soil.    In Germany, where the eastern storms are always cold and blighting,  while the western bring warm rains and mild weather, Thor was supposed  to journey always from west to east, to wage war against the evil  spirits which would fain have enveloped the country in impenetrable  veils of mist and have bound it in icy fetters.        Thor's Journey to Joetun-heim    As the giants from Joetun-heim were continually sending out cold  blasts of wind to nip the tender buds and hinder the growth of the  flowers, Thor once made up his mind to go and force them to behave  better. Accompanied by Loki he set out in his chariot, and after  riding for a whole day the gods came at nightfall to the confines of  the giant-world, where, seeing a peasant's hut, they resolved to stay  for rest and refreshment.    Their host was hospitable but very poor, and Thor, seeing that he  would scarcely be able to supply the necessary food to satisfy his  by no means small appetite, slew both his goats, which he cooked and  made ready to eat, inviting his host and family to partake freely of  the food thus provided, but cautioning them to throw all the bones,  without breaking them, into the skins of the goats which he had spread  out on the floor.    The peasant and his family ate heartily, but his son Thialfi,  encouraged by mischievous Loki, ventured to break one of the bones  and suck out the marrow, thinking his disobedience would not be  detected. On the morrow, however, Thor, ready to depart, struck the  goat skins with his hammer Mioelnir, and immediately the goats sprang up  as lively as before, except that one seemed somewhat lame. Perceiving  that his commands had been disregarded, Thor would have slain the whole  family in his wrath. The culprit acknowledged his fault, however,  and the peasant offered to compensate for the loss by giving the  irate god not only his son Thialfi, but also his daughter Roskva,  to serve him for ever.    Charging the man to take good care of the goats, which he left there  until he should return, and bidding the young peasants accompany  him, Thor now set out on foot with Loki, and after walking all day  found"]]]
