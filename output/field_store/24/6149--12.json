And my Observations were as follows.    When I observed and compared the deepest sensible red, and the Colour in  the Confine of green and blue, which at the Rectilinear Sides of the  Spectrum was distant from it half the Length of those Sides, the Focus  where the Confine of green and blue cast the Species of the Lines  distinctly on the Paper, was nearer to the Lens than the Focus, where  the red cast those Lines distinctly on it by about 2-1/2 or 2-3/4  Inches. For sometimes the Measures were a little greater, sometimes a  little less, but seldom varied from one another above 1/3 of an Inch.  For it was very difficult to define the Places of the Foci, without some  little Errors. Now, if the Colours distant half the Length of the  Image, (measured at its Rectilinear Sides) give 2-1/2 or 2-3/4  Difference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens, then the  Colours distant the whole Length ought to give 5 or 5-1/2 Inches  difference of those distances.    But here it's to be noted, that I could not see the red to the full end  of the Spectrum, but only to the Center of the Semicircle which bounded  that end, or a little farther; and therefore I compared this red not  with that Colour which was exactly in the middle of the Spectrum, or  Confine of green and blue, but with that which verged a little more to  the blue than to the green: And as I reckoned the whole Length of the  Colours not to be the whole Length of the Spectrum, but the Length of  its Rectilinear Sides, so compleating the semicircular Ends into  Circles, when either of the observed Colours fell within those Circles,  I measured the distance of that Colour from the semicircular End of the  Spectrum, and subducting half this distance from the measured distance  of the two Colours, I took the Remainder for their corrected distance;  and in these Observations set down this corrected distance for the  difference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens. For, as the  Length of the Rectilinear Sides of the Spectrum would be the whole  Length of all the Colours, were the Circles of which (as we shewed) that  Spectrum consists contracted and reduced to Physical Points, so in that  Case this corrected distance would be the real distance of the two  observed Colours.    When therefore I farther observed the deepest sensible red, and that  blue whose corrected distance from it was 7/12 Parts of the Length of  the Rectilinear Sides of the Spectrum, the difference of the distances  of their Foci from the Lens was about 3-1/4 Inches, and as 7 to 12, so  is 3-1/4 to 5-4/7.    When I observed the deepest sensible red, and that indigo whose  corrected distance was 8/12 or 2/3 of the Length of the Rectilinear  Sides of the Spectrum, the difference of the distances of their Foci  from the Lens, was about 3-2/3 Inches, and as 2 to 3, so is 3-2/3 to  5-1/2.    When I observed the deepest sensible red, and that deep indigo whose  corrected distance from one another was 9/12 or 3/4 of the Length of the  Rectilinear Sides of the Spectrum, the difference of the distances of  their Foci from the Lens was about 4 Inches; and as 3 to 4, so is 4 to  5-1/3.    When I observed the deepest sensible red, and that Part of the violet  next the indigo, whose corrected distance from the red was 10/12 or 5/6  of the Length of the Rectilinear Sides of the Spectrum, the difference  of the distances of their Foci from the Lens was about 4-1/2 Inches, and  as 5 to 6, so is 4-1/2 to 5-2/5. For sometimes, when the Lens was  advantageously placed, so that its Axis respected the blue, and all  Things else were well ordered, and the Sun shone clear, and I held my  Eye very near to the Paper on which the Lens cast the Species of the  Lines, I could see pretty distinctly the Species of those Lines by that  Part of the violet which was next the indigo; and sometimes I could see  them by above half the violet, For in making these Experiments I had  observed, that the Species of those Colours only appear distinct, which  were in or near the Axis of the Lens: So that if the blue or indigo were  in the Axis, I could see their Species distinctly; and then the red  appeared much less distinct than before. Wherefore I contrived to make  the Spectrum of Colours shorter than before, so that both its Ends might  be nearer to the Axis of the Lens. And now its Length was about 2-1/2  Inches, and Breadth about 1/5 or 1/6 of an Inch. Also instead of the  black Lines on which the Spectrum was cast, I made one black Line  broader than those, that I might see its Species more easily; and this  Line I divided by short cross Lines into equal Parts, for measuring the  distances of the observed Colours. And now I could sometimes see the  Species of this Line with its Divisions almost as far as the Center of  the semicircular violet End of the Spectrum, and made these farther  Observations.    When I observed the deepest sensible red, and that Part of the violet,  whose corrected distance from it was about 8/9 Parts of the Rectilinear  Sides of the Spectrum, the Difference of the distances of the Foci of  those Colours from the Lens, was one time 4-2/3, another time 4-3/4,  another time 4-7/8 Inches; and as 8 to 9, so are 4-2/3, 4-3/4, 4-7/8, to  5-1/4, 5-11/32, 5-31/64 respectively.    When I observed the deepest sensible red, and deepest sensible violet,  (the corrected distance of which Colours, when all Things were ordered  to the best Advantage, and the Sun shone very clear, was about 11/12 or  15/16 Parts of the Length of the Rectilinear Sides of the coloured  Spectrum) I found the Difference of the distances of their Foci from the  Lens sometimes 4-3/4 sometimes 5-1/4, and for the most part 5 Inches or  thereabouts; and as 11 to 12, or 15 to 16, so is five Inches to 5-2/2 or  5-1/3 Inches.    And by this Progression of Experiments I satisfied my self, that had the  Light at the very Ends of the Spectrum been strong enough to make the  Species of the black Lines appear plainly on the Paper, the Focus of the  deepest violet would have been found nearer to the Lens, than the Focus  of the deepest red, by about 5-1/3 Inches at least. And this is a  farther Evidence, that the Sines of Incidence and Refraction of the  several sorts of Rays, hold the same Proportion to one another in the  smallest Refractions which they do in the greatest.    My Progress in making this nice and troublesome Experiment I have set  down more at large, that they that shall try it after me may be aware of  the Circumspection requisite to make it succeed well. And if they cannot  make it succeed so well as I did, they may notwithstanding collect by  the Proportion of the distance of the Colours of the Spectrum, to the  Difference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens, what would be  the Success in the more distant Colours by a better trial. And yet, if  they use a broader Lens than I did, and fix it to a long strait Staff,  by means of which it may be readily and truly directed to the Colour  whose Focus is desired, I question not but the Experiment will succeed  better with them than it did with me. For I directed the Axis as nearly  as I could to the middle of the Colours, and then the faint Ends of the  Spectrum being remote from the Axis, cast their Species less distinctly  on the Paper than they would have done, had the Axis been successively  directed to them.    Now by what has been said, it's certain that the Rays which differ in  Refrangibility do not converge to the same Focus; but if they flow from  a lucid Point, as far from the Lens on one side as their Foci are on the  other, the Focus of the most refrangible Rays shall be nearer to the  Lens than that of the least refrangible, by above the fourteenth Part of  the whole distance; and if they flow from a lucid Point, so very remote  from the Lens, that before their Incidence they may be accounted  parallel, the Focus of the most refrangible Rays shall be nearer to the  Lens than the Focus of the least refrangible, by about the 27th or 28th  Part of their whole distance from it. And the Diameter of the Circle in  the middle Space between those two Foci which they illuminate, when they  fall there on any Plane, perpendicular to the Axis (which Circle is the  least into which they can all be gathered) is about the 55th Part of the  Diameter of the Aperture of the Glass. So that 'tis a wonder, that  Telescopes represent Objects so distinct as they do. But were all the  Rays of Light equally refrangible, the Error arising only from the  Sphericalness of the Figures of Glasses would be many hundred times  less. For, if the Object-glass of a Telescope be Plano-convex, and the  Plane side be turned towards the Object, and the Diameter of the  Sphere, whereof this Glass is a Segment, be called D, and the  Semi-diameter of the Aperture of the Glass be called S, and the Sine of  Incidence out of Glass into Air, be to the Sine of Refraction as I to R;  the Rays which come parallel to the Axis of the Glass, shall in the  Place where the Image of the Object is most distinctly made, be  scattered all over a little Circle, whose Diameter is _(Rq/Iq) x (S  cub./D quad.)_ very nearly,[H] as I gather by computing the Errors of  the Rays by the Method of infinite Series, and rejecting the Terms,  whose Quantities are inconsiderable. As for instance, if the Sine of  Incidence I, be to the Sine of Refraction "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33527"],[0,"Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Western North Atlantic (#13)"],[1,"[Illustration: Figure 34.--Head views of surfacing humpback whales.

Description    Bowhead whales, so-called because of the high-arching jaws and the  resultant contour of the head, reach a maximum length of about 65 feet  (19.8 m). They are extremely robust in form.    When viewed from the side, some swimming bowhead whales show two  characteristic curves to the back: the first extends from the tip of the  snout to just behind the blowholes; the second, encompassing the entire  back, begins just behind the head and extends all the way to the tail.  This character may be present only in adult animals and may be more  pronounced in males. Younger animals, particularly females, are often  stubbier and somewhat barrel-shaped behind the head. In all animals the  back is smooth, lacking even a trace of a dorsal fin.    The head of the bowhead whale is smooth, black, and without the bonnet  and the \"rock-garden,\" the colorful clusters of callosities  characteristic of the black right whale. The blowholes are widely  separated, and the blow emanating from them projects upward as two  separate, distinct spouts. Though two separate columns sometimes may be  visible under windless conditions in the blows of most mysticetes, this  feature is exaggerated and is most characteristic in the bowhead and  right whales.    Bowhead whales are black overall, except for a white \"vest\" of uneven  coloration on the chin. Within that vest, near the sides of the white  zone, there may be a series of grayish black to black spots, which on  some animals have been likened to a string of beads. The vest is clearly  visible when a surfacing animal is viewed from the front or the side or  when the animals hang vertically in the water with the head on the  surface and the tail flukes down, as they do during periods of early  spring mating.      Natural History Notes    Bowhead whales are usually found singly or in groups of up to three  animals, though fall concentrations may include up to 50 animals.    Bowhead whales sometimes breach, throwing most of the body clear of the  surface and reentering with a resounding splash.      May Be Confused With    Bowhead whales are the only species of large whales found routinely in  Arctic waters. Though other species, including some of the balaenopterid  whales and the right whale, may venture north as far as the southern  limits of the bowhead whale and beyond, they usually do so in the spring  and summer, at a time when the bowhead whales are farther to the north.  Even if they are encountered together, bowhead whales can be  distinguished from all the balaenopterid whales by the absence of a  dorsal fin. Bowhead whales have neither a fin nor the slightest trace of  a dorsal fin or ridge, while all the balaenopterids have a dorsal fin;  and their back is extremely smooth, like that of the right whale. The  bowhead and right whales may be readily distinguished from one another  by the characters listed below for stranded specimens.      Distribution    Though bowhead whales in the western North Atlantic were once  distributed from Arctic waters, from the edge of the ice, south as far  as the Strait of Belle Isle and the St. Lawrence River in such abundance  that they were once referred to simply as \"the whale,\" overwhaling  through the 19th century until as recently as 1911 has severely reduced  their numbers and restricted their modern range. Today in addition to  the more abundant populations of the Bering, Beaufort, and Chukchi seas  and the Sea of Okhotsk, there are populations off eastern Greenland and  in Davis Straits, Baffin Bay, James Bay, and the adjacent waters. Within  these ranges, bowhead whales move southward in front of the advancing  ice floes and may be expected near the southern limits of their range  from September or October through the early spring months. Populations  in the western North Atlantic appear to be increasing slowly.      Stranded Specimens    In addition to the fact that their ranges may overlap only slightly if  at all, bowhead whales may be distinguished from the other right whales  of the western North Atlantic by differences in 1) primary distribution,  2) coloration, 3) lengths of the longest baleen plates, and 4) presence  of callosities.
