At break of day, in spite  of the cold, they will gather in large flocks at some spring to drink  and bathe. Doctor Merriam says about them at such times:        \"They were like swarms of bees, buzzing about one's head and darting      to and fro in every direction. The air was full of them. They would      drop down to the water, dip their feet and bellies, and rise and      shoot away as if propelled by an unseen power. They would often dart      at the face of an intruder as if bent on piercing the eye with their      needle-like bills, and then poise for a moment almost within reach      before turning, when they were again lost in the busy throng.      Whether this act was prompted by curiosity or resentment I was not      able to ascertain.\"    As has already been said, there is not always unruffled peace in the  hummer family. Among the Rocky Mountains, and especially on the western  side of the range, there dwells another little hummer called the rufous  humming-bird, because the prevailing color of his plumage is reddish,  and between this family and the broad-tails there exists a bitter feud.  When, in the migrating season, a large number of both species gather  together in a locality where there is a cluster of wild-flowers, the  picture they make as they dart to and fro and bicker and fight for some  choice blossom, their metallic colors flashing in the sun, is so  brilliant as never to be forgotten by the spectator who is fortunate  enough to witness it.    [Illustration: \"_Pike's Peak in cloudland_\"]          OVER THE DIVIDE AND BACK      One June day a Denver & Rio Grande train bore the bird-lover from  Colorado Springs to Pueblo, thence westward to the mountains, up the  Grand Canyon of the Arkansas River, through the Royal Gorge, past the  smiling, sunshiny upper mountain valleys, over the Divide at Tennessee  Pass, and then down the western slopes to the next stopping-place, which  was Red Cliff, a village nestling in a deep mountain ravine at the  junction of Eagle River and Turkey Creek. The following day, a little  after \"peep o' dawn,\" I was out on the street, and was impressed by a  song coming from the trees on the acclivity above the village. \"Surely  that is a new song,\" I said to myself; \"and yet it seems to have a  familiar air.\" A few minutes of hard climbing brought me near enough to  get my glass on the little lyrist, and then I found it was only the  house-wren! \"How could you be led astray by so familiar a song?\" you  inquire. Well, that is the humiliating part of the incident, for I have  been listening to the house-wren's gurgling sonata for some twenty  years--rather more than less--and should have recognized it at once;  only it must be remembered that I was in a strange place, and had my  ears and eyes set for avian rarities, and therefore blundered.[5]        [5] On this incident I quote a personal note from my friend, Mr.      Aiken: \"The wren of the Rockies is the western house-wren, but is      the same form as that found in the Mississippi Valley. It is quite      possible that a difference in song may occur, but I have not noticed      any.\"    [Illustration: _Cliff-Swallows_    \"_On the rugged face of a cliff_\"]    To my surprise, I found many birds on those steep mountain sides, which  were quite well timbered. Above the village a colony of cliff-swallows  had a nesting place on the rugged face of a cliff, and were soaring  about catching insects and attending to the wants of their greedy young.    Besides the species named, I here found warbling vireos, broad-tailed  humming-birds, western nighthawks, ruby-crowned kinglets, magpies,  summer warblers, mountain chickadees, western wood-pewees, Louisiana  tanagers, long-crested jays, kingfishers, gray-headed juncos,  red-shafted flickers, pygmy nuthatches, house-finches, mountain jays,  and Clarke's nutcrackers. The only species noted here that had not  previously been seen east of the Divide was the pygmy nuthatch, a little  bird which scales the trunks and branches of trees like all his family,  but which is restricted to the Rocky Mountains. Like the white-breasted  nuthatch, he utters an alto call, \"Yang! yang! yang!\" only it is soft  and low--a miniature edition of the call of its eastern relative.    A mountain chickadee's nest was also found, and here I heard for the  first time one of these birds sing. Its performance was quite an  affecting little minor whistle, usually composed of four distinct notes,  though sometimes the vocalist contented himself with a song of two or  three syllables. The ordinary run might be represented phonetically in  this way, \"Phee, ph-e-e-e, phe-phe,\" with the chief emphasis on the  second syllable, which is considerably prolonged. The song is quite  different from that of the black-capped chickadee both in the intoning  and the technical arrangement, while it does not run so high in the  scale, nor does it impress me as being quite so much of a minor strain,  if such a distinction can be made in music. Both birds' tunes, however,  have the character of being whistled.    Glenwood is a charming summer resort in Colorado on the western side of  the Rocky Mountain range, and can be reached by both the Denver & Rio  Grande and the Colorado Midland Railways. Beautifully situated in an  open mountain valley, it possesses many attractions in the way of  natural scenery, while the cool breezes blow down from the snow-mantled  ranges gleaming in the distance, and the medicinal springs draw many  tourists in search of health and recuperation.    My purpose, however, in visiting this idyllic spot--I went there from  Red Cliff--was not primarily to view the scenery, nor to make use of the  healing waters, but to gratify my thirst for bird-lore. Having spent  some weeks in observing the avi-fauna east of the range, I had a  curiosity to know something of bird life west of the great chain of  alpine heights, and therefore I selected Glenwood as a fertile field in  which to carry on some investigations. While my stay at this resort was  all too short, it was of sufficient length to put me in possession of a  number of facts that may prove to be of general interest.    For one thing I learned, somewhat to my surprise, that the avian fauna  on both sides of the Divide is much the same. Indeed, with one  exception--to be noted more at length hereafter--I found no birds on  the western side that I had not previously seen on the eastern side,  although a longer and minuter examination would undoubtedly have  resulted in the discovery of a few species that are peculiar to the  regions beyond the range. In the extreme western and southwestern  portions of Colorado there are quite a number of species that are seldom  or never seen in the eastern part of the State. However, keeping to the  mountainous districts, and given the same altitude and other conditions,  you will be likely to find the same kinds of feathered folk on both  sides of the range. A few concrete cases will make this statement clear.  The elevation of Glenwood is five thousand seven hundred and fifty-eight  feet; that of Colorado Springs, five thousand nine hundred and  ninety-two feet; and the climatic conditions otherwise are practically  the same. Hence at both places the following species were found: Lazuli  buntings, Arkansas goldfinches, American goldfinches, western  wood-pewees, Arkansas kingbirds, Bullock's orioles, grassfinches, and  catbirds. At the same time there were a number of species in both  localities that have a more extensive vertical range, as, for example,  the western robins, which were seen in many places from the bases of the  mountains up to the timber-line, over eleven thousand five hundred feet  above sea-level.    _ROYAL GORGE_    _In the Grand Canyon of the Arkansas River. In canyons like this, their  walls rising almost vertically from one thousand to fifteen hundred  feet, few birds are to be seen. Occasionally a dove will fly from one  side of the gorge to the other before the scurrying train. From below a  magpie or a Clark's crow may sometimes be seen flying overhead across  the fearful chasm from one wall to the other, turning its head at  intervals as if to inspect and question the spectator over a thousand  feet below._    [Illustration]    The presence of practically the same avian fauna on both sides of the  great range suggests some speculations as to their movements in the  migrating season. Do those on the western side of the mountains travel  over the towering summits from the eastern plains? Or do they come up  from their southern winter homes by way of the valleys and plains west  of the range? Undoubtedly the latter is the correct surmise, for there  were birds at Glenwood that are never known to ascend far into the  mountains, and should they attempt to cross the Divide in the early  spring, they would surely perish in the intense cold of those elevated  regions, where snow often falls even in June, July, and August. One can  easily imagine some of the eastern and western residents meeting in the  autumn on the plains at the southern extremity of the mountain range,  dwelling together in some southern locality throughout the winter, and  then, when spring approaches, taking their separate routes, part going  east and part west of the range, for their breeding haunts in the North.  More than likely they do not meet again until the following autumn.  There are individuals, doubtless, that never catch a glimpse of the  western side of the great American watershed, while others are deprived  of the privilege of looking upon the majestic panoramas of the eastern  side.    What has just been said applies, of course, only to those species that  prefer to dwell in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25992"],[0,"The Martyrs of Science, or, The lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler (#13)"],[1,"Divine  aid in abjuring and detesting, and vowing never again to teach, the  doctrine of the earth's motion, and of the sun's stability. He pledged  himself that he would never again, either in words or in writing,  propagate such heresies; and he swore that he would fulfil and observe  the penances which had been inflicted upon him.[35] At the conclusion of  this ceremony, in which he recited his abjuration word for word, and  then signed it, he was conveyed, in conformity with his sentence, to the  prison of the Inquisition.         [35] It has been said, but upon what authority we cannot state,       that when Galileo rose from his knees, he stamped on the ground,       and said in a whisper to one of his friends, \"_E pur si muove._\"       \"It does move, though.\"--Life of Galileo, Lib. Useful Knowledge,       part ii. p. 63.    The account which we have now given of the trial and the sentence of  Galileo, is pregnant with the deepest interest and instruction. Human  nature is here drawn in its darkest colouring; and in surveying the  melancholy picture, it is difficult to decide whether religion or  philosophy has been most degraded. While we witness the presumptuous  priest pronouncing infallible the decrees of his own erring judgment, we  see the high-minded philosopher abjuring the eternal and immutable  truths which he had himself the glory of establishing. In the ignorance  and prejudices of the age--in a too literal interpretation of the  language of Scripture--in a mistaken respect for the errors that had  become venerable from their antiquity--and in the peculiar position  which Galileo had taken among the avowed enemies of the church, we may  find the elements of an apology, poor though it be, for the conduct of  the Inquisition. But what excuse can we devise for the humiliating  confession and abjuration of Galileo? Why did this master-spirit of the  age--this high-priest of the stars--this representative of science--this  hoary sage, whose career of glory was near its consummation--why did he  reject the crown of martyrdom which he had himself coveted, and which,  plaited with immortal laurels, was about to descend upon his head? If,  in place of disavowing the laws of Nature, and surrendering in his own  person the intellectual dignity of his species, he had boldly asserted  the truth of his opinions, and confided his character to posterity, and  his cause to an all-ruling Providence, he would have strung up the  hair-suspended sabre, and disarmed for ever the hostility which  threatened to overwhelm him. The philosopher, however, was supported  only by philosophy; and in the love of truth he found a miserable  substitute for the hopes of the martyr. Galileo cowered under the fear  of man, and his submission was the salvation of the church. The sword of  the Inquisition descended on his prostrate neck; and though its stroke  was not physical, yet it fell with a moral influence fatal to the  character of its victim, and to the dignity of science.    In studying with attention this portion of scientific history, the  reader will not fail to perceive that the Church of Rome was driven into  a dilemma, from which the submission and abjuration of Galileo could  alone extricate it. He who confesses a crime and denounces its  atrocity, not only sanctions but inflicts the punishment which is  annexed to it. Had Galileo declared his innocence, and avowed his  sentiments, and had he appealed to the past conduct of the Church  itself, to the acknowledged opinions of its dignitaries, and even to the  acts of its pontiffs, he would have at once confounded his accusers, and  escaped from their toils. After Copernicus, himself a catholic priest,  had _openly_ maintained the motion of the earth, and the stability of  the sun:--after he had dedicated the work which advocated these opinions  to Pope Paul III., on the express ground that the _authority of the  pontiff_ might silence the calumnies of those who attacked these  opinions by arguments drawn from Scripture:--after the Cardinal  Schonberg and the Bishop of Culm had urged Copernicus to publish the new  doctrines;--and after the Bishop of Ermeland had erected a monument to  commemorate his great discoveries;--how could the Church of Rome have  appealed to its pontifical decrees as the ground of persecuting and  punishing Galileo? Even in later times, the same doctrines had been  propagated with entire toleration: Nay, in the very year of Galileo's  first persecution, Paul Anthony Foscarinus, a learned Carmelite monk,  wrote a pamphlet, in which he illustrates and defends the mobility of  the earth, and endeavours to reconcile to this new doctrine the passages  of Scripture which had been employed to subvert it. This very singular  production was dated from the Carmelite convent at Naples; was dedicated  to the very reverend Sebastian Fantoni, general of the Carmelite order;  and, sanctioned by the ecclesiastical authorities, it was published at  Naples in 1615, the very year of the first persecution of Galileo.    Nor was this the only defence of the Copernican system which issued from  the bosom of the Church. Thomas Campanella, a Calabrian monk, published,  in 1622, \"_An Apology for Galileo_,\" and he even dedicates it to D.  Boniface, Cardinal of Cajeta. Nay, it appears from the dedication, that  he undertook the work at the command of the Cardinal, and that the  examination of the question had been entrusted to the Cardinal by the  Holy Senate. After an able defence of his friend, Campanella refers, at  the conclusion of his apology, to the suppression of Galileo's writings,  and justly observes, that the effect of such a measure would be to make  them more generally read, and more highly esteemed. The boldness of the  apologist, however, is wisely tempered with the humility of the  ecclesiastic, and he concludes his work with the declaration, that in  all his opinions, whether written or to be written, he submits himself  to the opinions of the Holy Mother Church of Rome and to the judgment of  his superiors.    By these proceedings of the dignitaries, as well as the clergy of the  Church of Rome, which had been tolerated for more than a century, the  decrees of the pontiffs against the doctrine of the earth's motion were  virtually repealed; and Galileo might have pleaded them with success in  arrest of judgment. Unfortunately, however, for himself and for science,  he acted otherwise. By admitting their authority, he revived in fresh  force these obsolete and obnoxious enactments; and, by yielding to their  power, he riveted for another century the almost broken chains of  spiritual despotism.    It is a curious fact in the annals of heresy and sedition, that opinions  maintained with impunity by one individual, have, in the same age,  brought others to the stake or to the scaffold. The results of deep  research or extravagant speculation seldom provoke hostility, when  meekly announced as the deductions of reason or the convictions of  conscience. As the dreams of a recluse or of an enthusiast, they may  excite pity or call forth contempt; but, like seed quietly cast into the  earth, they will rot and germinate according to the vitality with which  they are endowed. But, if new and startling opinions are thrown in the  face of the community--if they are uttered in triumph or in insult--in  contempt of public opinion, or in derision of cherished errors, they  lose the comeliness of truth in the rancour of their propagation; and  they are like seed scattered in a hurricane, which only irritates and  blinds the husbandman. Had Galileo concluded his _System of the World_  with the quiet peroration of his apologist Campanella, and dedicated it  to the Pope, it might have stood in the library of the Vatican, beside  the cherished though equally heretical volume of Copernicus.    In the abjuration of his opinions by Galileo, Pope Urban VII. did not  fail to observe the full extent of his triumph; and he exhibited the  utmost sagacity in the means which he employed to secure it. While he  endeavoured to overawe the enemies of the church by the formal  promulgation of Galileo's sentence and abjuration, and by punishing the  officials who had assisted in obtaining the license to print his work,  he treated Galileo with the utmost lenity, and yielded to every request  that was made to diminish, and almost suspend, the constraint under  which he lay. The sentence of abjuration was ordered to be publicly read  at several universities. At Florence the ceremonial was performed in the  church of Santa Croce, and the friends and disciples of Galileo were  especially summoned to witness the public degradation of their master.  The inquisitor at Florence was ordered to be reprimanded for his  conduct; and Riccardi, the master of the sacred palace, and Ciampoli,  the secretary of Pope Urban himself, were dismissed from their  situations.    Galileo had remained only four days in the prison of the Inquisition,  when, on the application of Niccolini, the Tuscan ambassador, he was  allowed to reside with him in his palace. As Florence still suffered  under the contagious disease which we have already mentioned, it was  proposed that Sienna should be the place of Galileo's confinement, and  that his residence should be in one of the convents of that city.  Niccolini, however, recommended the palace of the Archbishop Piccolomoni  as a more suitable residence; and though the Archbishop was one of  Galileo's best friends, the Pope agreed to the arrangement, and in the  beginning of July Galileo quitted Rome for Sienna.    After having spent nearly six months under the hospitable roof of his  friend, with no other restraint than that of being confined to the  limits of the palace, Galileo was permitted to return to his villa near  Florence under the same restrictions; and as the contagious disease had  disappeared in Tuscany, he was able in the month of December to re-ente"]]]
