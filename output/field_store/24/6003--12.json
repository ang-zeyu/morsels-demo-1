Certainly it would have prevented congestion  of traffic unto this day, and given St. Paul's (although somewhat  hemmed in on the east) a position unique amongst churches.[57] \"The  only and as it happened unsurmountable Difficulty remaining was the  obstinate Averseness of great Part of the Citizens to alter their old  Properties, and to secede from building their Houses again on the old  Ground and Foundations\"; and as rebuilding began almost as soon as the  smoke of the Fire had ceased, and long before anything definite could  be decided upon, a great opportunity was lost. The estimated  three-quarters of a million of souls and the vehicles innumerable now  crossing the boundaries every weekday are compelled, too often, to  traverse choked and narrow streets, and not without danger to life and  limb; while St. Paul's itself, cribbed, cabined, confined, becomes in  each successive generation more hemmed in as the surrounding emporiums  and magazines grow taller and taller.    At first the idea was entertained of restoring the ruins, but this was  finally abandoned by royal warrant to the Commissioners in 1668, and  clearing and excavations began. The workmen with pickaxes stood on the  top of the walls some eighty feet high, and others below cleared away  the dislodged stones--a dangerous task in which lives were lost. Of  the Central Tower some two hundred feet remained, and a more  expeditious plan was adopted. A deal box, containing eighteen pounds  of gunpowder, was exploded level with the foundations at the centre of  the north-west pillar, and the adjacent arches were lifted some nine  inches, while these ruins \"suddenly jumping down, made a great Heap of  Ruin in the Place without scattering.\" Wren estimated the whole weight  lifted at three thousand tons, and the labour saved equal to that of a  battalion of a thousand men. When the alarmed inhabitants of the  neighbourhood heard and felt the concussion, they naturally took it  for an earthquake. In the surveyor's absence a subordinate used too  much powder in attempting a second mine, and neither burying it low  enough nor building up the mouth, a stone was projected through an  open window into a room where some women were sitting at work.  Although no one was hit, the neighbours took alarm, and successfully  agitated against all further blasting. Delay was caused, and finally a  battering-ram some forty feet in length, worked by thirty men,  completed the demolition. The stones and rubbish were cleared away,  and used in different buildings and in repairing the streets.  Afterwards some houses on the north side which encroached on the  building, and may have been those that assisted the passage of the  Fire, were levelled, and their site included in the churchyard.    When at length the ruins of Old St. Paul's had come down and the huge  mass of wreckage been cleared away, working from the west the  excavations for the new foundations were begun. The old cathedral had  rested on a layer of loam, or \"pot earth\" or \"brick earth,\" near the  surface; and wells being sunk at various points to ascertain the depth  of this, it was found that the loam, owing to the ground sloping  towards the south, gradually diminished from a depth of six feet to  four. Sinking further, they found sand so loose as to run through the  fingers; next, freshwater shells and more sand, and continuing through  hard beach or gravel, they reached at last the London clay.[58] At one  point of the north-east corner, where the loam had been dug out, Wren  was compelled to rest the foundations on the clay; and it seems almost  a pity that this was not universally adopted, at whatever additional  cost of time and labour, in preference to the loam. The building had  not long been completed ere the great weight of the dome caused some  of the piers to sink from an inch to more than two inches, and Edward  Strong the younger had to repair cracks and fissures.[59] Dean Milman  tells us that in his time the City authorities once contemplated a  sewer on the south side; but the surveyor, Mr. R. Cockerell,  remembering that the sand and shells underneath the loam would be in  danger of oozing out, went in great haste to him, and on their joint  representation the project was abandoned.    The old cathedral was not due east and west, neither did it directly  face Ludgate Hill. Owing to the lie of the land cleared away, both of  these peculiarities were increased by the surveyor, and the axis of  the New St. Paul's was swung some seven degrees further north than the  Old. He thereby made the best of his somewhat cramped site, and  avoided the foundations of the old walls. The excavations were not  completed nor the site fully cleared and made ready until 1674.       [Illustration: RELATIVE POSITION AND AREA OF THE GROUND-PLANS OF     OLD AND NEW ST. PAUL'S.     _Reproduced from Longman's \"Three Cathedrals of St. Paul's.\"_]    It has been the lament of many that the Pointed arch had by the time  of the Fire died out, and that the Renaissance style, borrowed from  Italy, had taken the place in England of Gothic architecture. \"About  two hundred years ago,\" we are told in the \"Parentalia,\" \"when  ingenious Men began to reform the _Roman_ Language to the Purity which  they assigned and fixed to the Time of _Augustus_ and of that Century,  the Architects also, ashamed of the modern Barbarity of Building,  began to examine carefully the Ruins of _Old Rome_ and _Italy_; to  search into the Orders and Proportions, and to establish them by  inviolable Rules: so to their Labour and Industry we owe in a great  Degree the Restoration of Architecture.\" Here we have the Renaissance  style defined. Wren would naturally have fallen in with the fashion of  his own time; and the faults he found in his elaborate surveys at Old  St. Paul's, Salisbury, and elsewhere confirmed him in his adherence.  He found \"a Discernment of no contemptible Art, Ingenuity and  geometrical Skill in the Design and Execution of some few\"; but this  was more than counterbalanced by grave faults: \"An affectation of  Height and Grandeur, tho' without Regularity and good Proportion, in  most of them.\" They are loaded with too much carving and tracery, and  in other ways offend his taste, but chiefly in the neglect of a due  regard to stability. \"There is scarce any _Gothick_ Cathedral, that I  have seen, at home or abroad, wherein I have not observed the Pillars  to yield and bend inwards from the Weight of the Vault of the Aile....  For this Reason this Form of Churches has been rejected by modern  Architects abroad who use the better and _Roman_ Art of  Architecture.... Almost all the Cathedrals of the _Gothick_ Form are  weak and defective in the Poise of the Vault of the Aile.\"[60] On the  other hand, he reckoned the dome \"a form of church-building unknown in  England, but of wonderful Grace,\" and, moreover, the dome wasted a  minimum of space, whilst a mediaeval cathedral could accommodate only a  small auditory in proportion to its large area, so that every one  could both see and hear. Any place of worship was in his eyes badly or  imperfectly constructed in which the preacher's voice could not travel  so as to be distinctly heard. There is much to be said on both sides  in regard to the comparative merits of Gothic and Renaissance; and  instead of echoing complaints, it is surely better to be thankful we  have one cathedral, situated in the greatest centre of population, in  the latter style.[61]       [Illustration: MODEL OF WREN'S FIRST DESIGN     _Reproduced from Longman's \"Three Cathedrals,\" &c._     [The western cupola is an addition to the design shown on p. 57]]    In 1668 a small committee of eight, in addition to the Dean and  Chapter, was appointed, and about the same time Wren set seriously to  work and soon after produced his first design (see p. 57). In addition  to the reasons already mentioned, he had at first to take into  consideration the all-important question of finance, for when he began  there were only voluntary contributions to fall back upon; but in 1670  a share of the import duties on coal was granted, and soon constituted  the greater part of the rebuilding fund. In 1673 an enlarged  commission of over a hundred members was nominated by royal warrant,  with the Lord Mayor at its head, who took precedence over the Primate  and the Bishop; and Wren laid his first design before them, of which a  model was made. This was a kind of Greek cross; the external order was  the Corinthian, with Attic above. It bore a general resemblance to a  rotunda, and was crowned with a dome taken from the Pantheon at Rome.  This dome was of about the same diameter as the present, but less  lofty, and was likewise supported by eight pillars. West of the  rotunda part was the foot of the cross, and a secondary dome was  afterwards added. When Wren began to design this we have seen that  amongst other considerations was that of finance[62]; but even had the  coal dues been then granted, it is certain that he would have adhered  to it, for it was always a great favourite. In designing it he took  two facts into consideration: (1) that the outdoor sermons, formerly  preached at the Cross, were for the future to be preached inside, and  that a large auditorium would be required for this purpose (2) that  religious processions inside were now discouraged, and that a nave and  aisles were in consequence a useless waste of space and means.[63]  Forgetting these two important items, a vast amount of adverse  criticism has been bestowed upon Wren's favourite. Its main drawback  was the absence of a proper Sacrarium; and yet so obvious were its  advantages, that when a cathedral was lately proposed for Liverpool,  no less an authority on architecture than the late Canon Venables  advocated its adoption.

The  part of the Sun that we see is its luminous surface, or photosphere.    From this agitated surface there is a constant ejection of gigantic  eruptions, immense jets of flame, geysers of fire, projected at a  terrific speed to prodigious heights.    For years astronomers were greatly perplexed as to the nature of these  incandescent masses, known as prominences, which shot out like  fireworks, and were only visible during the total eclipses of the Sun.  But now, thanks to an ingenious invention of Janssen and Lockyer, these  eruptions can be observed every day in the spectroscope, and have been  registered since 1868, more particularly in Rome and in Catania, where  the Society of Spectroscopists was founded with this especial object,  and publishes monthly bulletins in statistics of the health of the Sun.    These prominences assume all imaginable forms, and often resemble our  own storm-clouds; they rise above the chromosphere with incredible  velocity, often exceeding 200 kilometers (124 miles) per second, and  are carried up to the amazing height of 300,000 kilometers (186,000  miles).    [Illustration: FIG. 31.--Rose-colored solar flames 228,000 kilometers  (141,500 miles) in height, _i.e._, 18 times the diameter of the Earth.]    The Sun is surrounded with these enormous flames on every side;  sometimes they shoot out into space like splendid curving roseate  plumes; at others they rear their luminous heads in the Heavens, like  the cleft and waving leaves of giant palm-trees. Having illustrated a  remarkable type of solar spot, it is interesting to submit to the reader  a precise observation of these curious solar flames. That reproduced  here was observed in Rome, January 30, 1885. It measured 228,000  kilometers (141,500 miles) in height, eighteen times the diameter of the  earth (represented alongside in its relative magnitude). (Fig. 31.)    Solar eruptions have been seen to reach, in a few minutes, a height of  more than 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles), and then to fall back in a  flaming torrent into that burning and inextinguishable ocean.    Observation, in conjunction with spectral analysis, shows these  prominences to be due to formidable explosions produced within the  actual substance of the Sun, and projecting masses of incandescent  hydrogen into space with considerable force.    Nor is this all. During an eclipse one sees around the black disk of the  Moon as it passes in front of the Sun and intercepts its light, a  brilliant and rosy aureole with long, luminous, branching feathers  streaming out, like aigrettes, which extend a very considerable distance  from the solar surface. This aureole, the nature of which is still  unknown to us, has received the name of _corona_. It is a sort of  immense atmosphere, extremely rarefied. Our superb torch, accordingly,  is a brazier of unparalleled activity--a globe of gas, agitated by  phenomenal tempests whose flaming streamers extend afar. The smallest of  these flames is so potent that it would swallow up our world at a single  breath, like the bombs shot out by Vesuvius, that fall back within the  crater.    What now is the real heat of this incandescent focus? The most accurate  researches estimate the temperature of the surface of the Sun at  7,000 deg.C. The internal temperature must be considerably higher. A  crucible of molten iron poured out upon the Sun would be as a stream of  ice and snow.    We can form some idea of this calorific force by making certain  comparisons. Thus, the heat given out appears to be equal to that which  would be emitted by a colossal globe of the same dimensions (that is, as  voluminous as twelve hundred and eighty thousand terrestrial globes),  entirely covered with a layer of incandescent coal 28 kilometers (18  miles) in depth, all burning at equal combustion. The heat emitted by  the Sun, at each second, is equal to that which would result from the  combustion of eleven quadrillions six hundred thousand milliards of tons  of coal, all burning together. This same heat would bring to the boil in  an hour, two trillions nine hundred milliards of cubic kilometers of  water at freezing-point.    Our little planet, gravitating at 149,000,000 kilometers (93,000,000  miles) from the Sun, arrests on the way, and utilizes, only the half of  a milliard part of this total radiation.    How is this heat maintained? One of the principal causes of the heat of  the Sun is its condensation. According to all probabilities, the solar  globe represents for us the nucleus of a vast nebula, that extended in  primitive times beyond the orbit of Neptune, and which in its  contraction has finally produced this central focus. In virtue of the  law of transformation of motion into heat, this condensation, which has  not yet reached its limit, suffices to raise this colossal globe to its  level of temperature, and to maintain it there for millions of years. In  addition, a substantial number of meteors is forever falling into it.  This furnace is a true pandemonium.    The Sun weighs three hundred and twenty-four thousand times more than  the Earth--that is to say, eighteen hundred and seventy octillions of  kilograms:               1,870,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000            (1,842,364,532,019,704,433,497,536,945 tons).    In Chapter XI we shall explain the methods by which it has been found  possible to weigh the Sun and determine its exact distance.           *       *       *       *       *    I trust these figures will convey some notion of the importance and  nature of the Sun, the stupendous orb on whose rays our very existence  depends. Its apparent dimension (which is only half a degree, 32', and  would be hidden from sight, like that of the full moon, which is about  the same, by the tip of the little finger held out at arm's length),  represents, as we have seen, a real dimension that is colossal, _i.e._,  1,383,000 kilometers (more than 857,000 miles), and this is owing to the  enormous distance that separates us from it. This distance of  149,000,000 kilometers (93,000,000 miles) is sufficiently hard to  appreciate. Let us say that 11,640 terrestrial globes would be required  to throw a bridge from here to the Sun, while 30 would suffice from the  Earth to the Moon. The Moon is 388 times nearer to us than the Sun. We  may perhaps conceive of this distance by calculating that a train,  moving at constant speed of 1 kilometer (0.6214 mile) a minute, would  take 149,000,000 minutes, that is to say 103,472 days, or 283 years, to  cross the distance that separates us from this orb. Given the normal  duration of life, neither the travelers who set out for the Sun, nor  their children, nor their grandchildren, would arrive there: only the  seventh generation would reach the goal, and only the fourteenth could  bring us back news of it.    Children often cry for the Moon. If one of these inquisitive little  beings could stretch out its arms to touch the Sun, and burn its fingers  there, it would not feel the burn for one hundred and sixty-seven years  (when it would no longer be an infant), for the nervous impulse of  sensation can only be transmitted from the ends of the fingers to the  brain at a velocity of 28 meters per second.    'Tis long. A cannon-ball would reach the Sun in ten years. Light, that  rapid arrow that flies through space at a velocity of 300,000 kilometers  (186,000 miles per second), takes only eight minutes seventeen seconds  to traverse this distance.           *       *       *       *       *    This brilliant Sun is not only sovereign of the Earth; he is also the  head of a vast planetary system.    The orbs that circle round the Sun are opaque bodies, spherical in  shape, receiving their light and heat from the central star, on which  they absolutely depend. The name of planets given to them signifies  \"wandering\" stars. If you observe the Heavens on a fine starry night,  and are sufficiently acquainted with the principal stars of the Zodiac  as described in a preceding chapter, you may be surprised on certain  evenings to see the figure of some zodiacal constellation slightly  modified by the temporary presence of a brilliant orb perhaps surpassing  in its luminosity the finest stars of the first magnitude.    If you watch this apparition for some weeks, and examine its position  carefully in regard to the adjacent stars, you will observe that it  changes its position more or less slowly in the Heavens. These wandering  orbs, or _planets_, do not shine with intrinsic light; they are  illuminated by the Sun.    The planets, in effect, are bodies as opaque as the Earth, traveling  round the God of Day at a speed proportional to their distance. They  number eight principal orbs, and may be divided into two quite distinct  groups by which we may recognize them: the first comprises four planets,  of relatively small dimensions in comparison with those of the second  group, which are so voluminous that the least important of them is  larger than the other four put together.    In order of distance from the Sun, we first encounter:              MERCURY, VENUS, THE EARTH, AND MARS    These are the worlds that are nearest to the orb of day.    The four following, and much more remote, are, still in order of  distance:              JUPITER, SATURN, URANUS, AND NEPTUNE    This second group is separated from the first by a vast space occupied  by quite a little army of minute planets, tiny cosmic bodies, the  largest of which measures little more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) in  diameter, and the smallest some few miles only.    The planets which form these three groups represent the principal  members of the solar family. But the Sun is a patriarch, and each of his  daughters has her own children who, while obeying the paternal influence"]]]
