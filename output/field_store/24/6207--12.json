Then it thrusts out its  tail-foot, swells its body to an oval globe, protrudes its feeler, and  slightly exposes a row of cilia. After this two distinct wheels are  everted, and as their cilia whirl and spin, the animal is swiftly rowed  along, until it thinks proper to moor itself fast by the tail-foot, and  employ all its ciliary power in causing currents to converge towards its  throat. When it pleases it can elongate the body, till it becomes  vermiform, and it walks like the common rotifer, by curving its back,  and bringing its nose and its tail in contact with the ground.    [Illustration: Philodina (crawling).]    The gizzard of this family (_Philodinaea_) presents a considerable  deviation from the perfect form exhibited by the _Brachions_. According  to Mr. Gosse, \"The _mallei_ and the _incus_ (terms already explained)  are soldered together into two subquadrantic-globular masses, which  appear to be muscular, but invested with a solid integument. The  _manubria_ (handles) may still be recognised in a vertical aspect as  three loops, of which the central one is chiefly developed, and in a  vertical aspect as a translucent reniform (kidney-shaped) globe.\" These  descriptions are not easy to understand, not from any want of clearness  or precision in the words employed, but from the complicated character  of the organ, and its very different appearance under different aspects.  To make the matter more intelligible, Mr. Gosse adds, \"the structure and  action of an apparatus of this type may be made more clear by a homely  illustration. Suppose an apple to be divided longitudinally, leaving the  stalk attached to one half. Let this now be split again longitudinally  so far as the stalk, but not actually separating either portion from it.  Draw the two portions slightly apart, and lay them down on their rounded  surfaces. They now represent the quadrantic masses in repose, the stalk  being the fulcrum, and the upper surfaces being crossed by the teeth. By  the contraction of the muscles, of which they are composed, the two  segments are made to turn upon their long axis, until the points of the  teeth are brought into contact, and the toothed surfaces rise and  approach each other. The lower edges do not, however, separate as the  upper edges approach, but the form of the mass alters, becoming more  lenticular, so that when the toothed surfaces are brought into their  closest approximation, the outline has a subcircular figure. It is on  account of this change of form that I presume the masses themselves to  be partially composed of muscle.\"    These remarks, although specially made of the _Rotifer macrurus_, are in  the main applicable to all the Philodinas, but the student must not  expect to understand any of the complicated gizzards of the rotifers  without repeated observations, and no small exercise of patience. It is  common to call the portions of the Philodine-pattern gizzard  \"stirrup-shaped,\" but Mr. Gosse has shown them to be _quadrantic_, that  is, shaped like the quarter of a sphere.    As we are not very well off with subjects for description in these two  months, we can afford a little time to consider a question that  continually arises in the mind, on viewing the movements of animalcules,  and especially of any so highly developed as the rotifers, namely, to  what extent motions which appear intelligent are really the result of  anything like a conscious purpose or will. When any of the lower  animals--a bee, for example--acts in precisely the same way as all bees  have acted since their proceedings have been observed, we settle the  question by the use of the term _instinct_. Those who take the lowest  view of insect life, assume that the bee flies because it has wings, but  without wishing to use them, and that the nerves exciting them to action  are in their turn excited, not by volition, but by some physical  stimulus.    The sight or the smell of flowers is thought by the same reasoners to be  capable of attracting the insect, which is unconscious of the  attraction, while proximity of food stimulates the tongue to make the  movements needful for its acquisition, and so forth. The cells, they  tell us, are built according to a pattern which the earliest bee was  impelled to construct by forces that bear no analogy to human reason and  human will, and so originate all the ordinary processes of bee life.  Sometimes, however, it happens that man or accident interposes  particular obstacles, and forthwith there appears a particular  modification of the orthodox plan, calculated to meet the special  difficulty. How is this? Does any one of the difficulties which the bee  or the ant is able to get over, produce precisely that kind of  electrical disturbance, or polar arrangement of nerve particles that is  necessary to stimulate the _first_ step of the action by which the  difficulty is surmounted; and does the new condition thus established  stimulate the _second_ step, and so forth, or can the bee, within  certain limits, really _think_, design, and contrive?    No questions are more difficult of solution; but while protesting  against a tendency to undervalue all life below that of man, we must  remember we have in our bodies processes going on which are not the  result of volition, as when the blood circulates, and its particles  arrange themselves in the pattern required to form our tissues and  organs, and also that many of our actions belong to the class termed by  physiologists, \"reflex,\" that is, the result of external impressions  upon the nervous system, in which the _sentient_ brain takes no part.  Thus when a strong light stimulates the optic nerve, the portion of  brain with which it is connected in its turn stimulates the iris to  contract the pupil; and it is supposed that after a man has begun to  walk, through the exercise of his will, he may continue to walk, by a  reflex action; as his feet press the ground they transmit an impression  to the spinal cord, and the legs receive a fresh impulse to locomotion,  although the mind is completely occupied with other business, and pays  no attention to their proceedings.[14] The ordinary movements of insects  appear to be of this character, and to be excited by the ganglia  belonging to the segment to which the moving limbs are attached. Thus a  centipede will run, after its head has been cut off, and a water-beetle  (_Dytiscus_) swam energetically when thrown into water after its brain  had been removed.[15]    [14] See Carpenter's 'Manual of Physiology.'    [15] Carpenter's 'Manual of Physiology,' p. 551.    It must not, however, be assumed that the brain of insects has nothing  to do with their movements. It is probably the means of co-ordinating or  directing them to a common end, and gives rise to what are called  _consensual_ movements, that is, movements which are accompanied or  stimulated by a sensation, although not controlled by a will. In man  these actions are frequently exhibited, \"as when laughter is provoked by  some ludicrous sight or sound, or by the remembrance of such at an  unseasonable hour.\"[16] Sneezing is another instance of a sensation  leading to certain motions, without any intervention of the human will.    [16] Ibid., p. 543.    Speaking of these consensual motions, Dr. Carpenter observes, \"It is  probable, from the strong manifestations of emotion, exhibited by many  of the lower animals, that some of the actions which we assemble under  the general designation of instinctive are to be referred to this  group.\"    The insect brain is composed of a supra-oesophagal ganglion and  infra-oesophagal one. Von Siebold says, the first corresponds to the  cerebrum of the vertebrata, and \"the second is comparable, perhaps, to  the cerebellum or spinal cord.\"[17] The superior ganglion gives off  nerves to the antennae and eyes, the lower one to the mandibles, &c. So  far as is known the insects that exhibit the most intelligence have the  largest and best developed brains.    [17] 'Anatomy of Invertebrates,' Burnett's trans.    A special volume would be required for anything like a complete  examination of the little which is known on this subject, but these few  remarks may assist the microscopic beginner in examining the movements  of his subjects, and guard against the error of referring to reason and  volition those which are, probably, either the direct result of  stimulants applied to the surface (as in nerveless creatures), or the  indirect (reflex) result of such stimulants in beings like the rotifers,  who have a nervous system; or the result of _sensations_, which excite  actions without previously referring the matter to the decision of a  will. It must not, however, be too readily assumed that the behaviour of  creatures possessing distinct organs is entirely automatic; and we must  not forget that even the best physiologists know very little concerning  the range of functions which the nervous ganglia of the invertebrata are  able to discharge.

It is always a treat to a Londoner to get down to any of the picturesque  parts of Surrey; the trees exhibit a richness of foliage and variety"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36922"],[0,"Antarctic Penguins: A Study of Their Social Habits (#13)"],[1,"the back of an enormous killer-whale (_Orca gladiator_) rose  above the surface as it crossed the lead from side to side, appearing  from beneath the ice on one side and disappearing beneath it on the  other. To my surprise, not the slightest fear was shown by the birds in  the water. Had this beast been a sea-leopard, there would have been a  stampede, and every bird have leapt from the water on to the sea-ice. On  this evidence I formed the opinion that in all probability killer-whales  do no harm to Adelie penguins; later I saw it confirmed, when a school  of killers shaved close past several floes that were crowded with  Adelies, and made not the least attempt to get at them, as they might so  easily have done by upsetting the floes. Very probably this is because  the agile bird can escape with such ease from the ponderous whale, and  fears it no more than a terrier fears a cow, though he thinks twice  before coming within reach of its jaws.      [Illustration: Fig. 55. \"WITH GRACEFUL ARCHING OF HIS NECK, APPEARED    TO ASSURE HER OF HIS READINESS TO TAKE CHARGE\" (Page 90)]    When the sea-ice had gone out, leaving open water right up to the  ice-foot, a ledge of ice was left along the western side of the rookery,  forming a sort of terrace or \"front,\" with its sides composed of blue  ice, rising sheer out of the water to a height of some six feet or more  in places. From this point of vantage it was possible to stand and watch  the penguins as they swam in the clear water below, and some idea was  formed of their wonderful agility when swimming beneath the surface. As  they propelled themselves along with powerful strokes of their wings,  they swerved from side to side to secure the little prawn-like euphausia  which literally swarm everywhere in the Antarctic seas, affording them  ample food at all times. Their gluttonous habits here became very  evident. They would gobble euphausia until they could hold no more, only  to vomit the whole meal into the water as they swam, and so enlightened  start to feast again. As they winged their way along, several feet  beneath the surface, a milky cloud would suddenly issue from their  mouths and drift slowly away down stream, as, without the slightest  pause in their career, they dashed eagerly along in the hunt for more.    When a penguin returned to his mate on the nest, after his jaunt in the  sea, much formality had to be gone through before he was allowed to take  charge of the eggs. This ceremony of \"relieving guard\" almost invariably  was observed.    Going up to his mate, with much graceful arching of his neck, he  appeared to assure her in guttural tones of his readiness to take charge  (Fig. 55). At this she would become very agitated, replying with raucous  staccato notes, and refusing to budge from her position on the eggs.  Then both would become angry for a while, arguing in a very heated  manner, until at last she would rise, and, standing by the side of the  nest, allow him to walk on to it, which he immediately did, and after  carefully placing the eggs in position, sink down upon them, afterwards  thrusting his bill beneath his breast to push them gently into a  comfortable position. After staying by him for a little while, the other  at length would go off to bathe and feed.      [Illustration: Fig. 56. \"The Chicks began to appear\"    (A Typical Group of Nests)]      [Illustration: Fig. 57. An Adelie being Sick (Page 94)]    The length of time during which each bird was away varied considerably,  but a \"watch bill\" was kept of one particular pair with the following  result:(5)      (5) This \"watch-bill\" was kindly kept for me by Mr. Priestly on his    meteorological rounds, the nests being near the thermometer screen.    Nov. 14. Egg laid. Hen sitting.    Nov. 27. A cock seen to join the hen for the first time since the 14th.  He took her place on the nest. This was the first day on which any red  guano was seen about the nest.    Dec. 10. The hen returned between 8 P.M. and 10 P.M., having been absent  since November 27.

Cock on the nest with the chick.      [Illustration: Fig. 58. METHOD OF FEEDING THE YOUNG (Page 94)]    From the above Table it will be seen that the hen was not relieved by  the cock until a fortnight after she had laid her egg (in this case  there was only one) so that probably she had been without food for a  month. Then she left, and only returned to relieve the cock after the  lapse of another fortnight, it being worth remarking that each was  absent for the same length of time. When the chick was hatched, a  different regime began, as of course the chick had to be fed and  journeys to the sea made at regular intervals for the purpose of getting  food.    When the chicks began to appear all over the rookery (Fig. 56), a marked  change was noticed in the appearance of the parents as they made their  way on foot from the water's edge to the nests. Hitherto they had been  merely remarkable for their spotless and glistening plumage, but now  they were bringing with them food for the young, and so distended were  their stomachs with this, that they had to lean backward as they walked,  to counterbalance their bulging bellies, and in consequence frequently  tripped over the inequalities of the ground which were thus hidden from  their gaze.    What with the exertion of tramping with their burden across the rookery,  and perhaps on rare occasions one or two little disputes with other  penguins by the way, frequently they were in some distress before they  reached their destination, and quite commonly they would be sick and  bring up the whole offering before they got there. Consequently, little  red heaps of mashed up and half digested euphausia were to be seen about  the rookery. Once I saw a penguin, after he had actually reached the  nest, quite unable to wait for the chick to help itself in the usual  manner, deposit the lot upon the ground in front of his mate. I saw what  was coming and secured the accompanying photograph of the incident.  (Fig. 57.) When this happens the food is wasted, as neither chick nor  adult will touch it however hungry they may be, the former only feeding  by the natural method of pushing his head down the throat of a parent,  and so helping himself direct from the gullet. (Fig. 58.)      [Illustration: Fig. 59. PROFILE OF AN ADELIE CHICK (Page 95)]    When the chicks are small they are kept completely covered by the parent  who sits on the nest. They grow, however, at an enormous rate, gobbling  vast quantities of food as it is brought to them, their elastic bellies  seeming to have no limit to their capacity (Fig. 59); indeed, when  standing, they rest on a sort of tripod, formed by the protuberant belly  in front and the two feet behind.    I weighed a chick at intervals for some time, and this was the  astonishing result:                                 Ounces      The egg                     4.56    The chick when hatched      3.00    Five days old              13.00    Six      \"                 15.75    Eight    \"                 24.75    Nine     \"                 28.50    Eleven   \"                 37.75    Twelve   \"                 42.50    To see an Adelie chick of a fortnight's growth trying to get itself  covered by its mother is a most ludicrous sight. The most it can hope  for is to get its head under cover, the rest of its body being exposed  to the air; but the downy coat of the chick is close and warm, and  suffices in all weathers to protect it from the cold. Fig. 60  illustrates what I have said very well, whilst Fig. 61 shows a mother  with a chick twelve days old.    Whilst the chicks are small the two parents manage to keep them fed  without much difficulty;(6) but as one of them has always to remain at  the nest to keep the chicks warm, guard them from skuas and hooligan  cocks, and prevent them from straying, only one is free to go for food.  Later on, however, two other factors introduce themselves. The first of  these is that the chick's downy coats become thick enough to protect  them from cold without the warmth of the parent; and the second that as  the chicks grow they require an ever-increasing quantity of food, and at  the age of about a fortnight this demand becomes too great for one bird  to cope with. At this time it is still necessary to prevent the chicks  from straying and to protect them from the skuas and \"hooligans,\" and so  to meet these two demands a most interesting social"]]]
