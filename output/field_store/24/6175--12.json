The riffle at Area 1 is, for the most part, deeper and faster than at  Area 3 and has a bottom composed of gravel and small rocks. The creek  chub, stoneroller, channel catfish (young-of-the-year), flathead  (young-of-the-year), and stonecat reached their greatest abundance in  Area 1. All species that showed a preference for riffles were rare or  absent in Area 5 where no riffle-habitat was sampled. The  riffle-dwelling species that were present in collections made with  rotenone in the deeper pools were taken from the riffle into which  rotenone was introduced.    The river carpsucker, blunt-nosed minnow, fat-headed minnow, channel  catfish (yearlings and two-year-olds), flathead (yearlings and  two-year-olds), green sunfish and long-eared sunfish showed a preference  for shallow, quiet water. All of these species were more common in  collections from Areas 5 and 6 than in collections from other areas.      TABLE 13.

Stoneroller, channel catfish (young-of-the-year), green sunfish, and  long-eared sunfish formed the most stable element of the population, in  that the numbers of these species varied less in successive collections  than did numbers of other species.    The number of orange-throated darters remained constant at Areas 1 and  3, and the number of stonecats changed little in successive collections  from Area 3. I suspect that an apparent decline in stonecats at Area 1  on September 4 was due to a slow rate of dispersal from the point of  release (see pages 413, 414).    Some species (sucker-mouthed minnow, red-finned shiner, slender-headed  darter, and fat-headed minnow) decreased significantly in successive  samples from the same area because of mortality in handling or movement  out of the area of initial capture.    The decrease in abundance of the sucker-mouthed minnow may have been due  to some mobility of the species. Evidence for mortality caused by  handling was obtained for the red-finned shiner and probably accounts  for the reduction of this species in Area 6. The red-finned shiner is  also probably a mobile species. The reduction in abundance of the  slender-headed darter seems unexplainable because no evidence was  obtained for either movement or mortality.    Fat-headed minnows also declined markedly in successive collections from  Area 6, the only area in which the species was common. No marked  fat-headed minnows were taken outside the area of release, indicating  low mobility of the species. I cannot certainly account for their  decline; possibly there was latent mortality due to shocking.

Fragment #5--Diodorus iv. 85: Some say that great earthquakes occurred,  which broke through the neck of land and formed the straits [1403], the  sea parting the mainland from the island. But Hesiod, the poet, says  just the opposite: that the sea was open, but Orion piled up the  promontory by Peloris, and founded the close of Poseidon which is  especially esteemed by the people thereabouts. When he had finished  this, he went away to Euboea and settled there, and because of his  renown was taken into the number of the stars in heaven, and won undying  remembrance.          THE PRECEPTS OF CHIRON (fragments)    Fragment #1--Scholiast on Pindar, Pyth. vi. 19: 'And now, pray, mark  all these things well in a wise heart. First, whenever you come to your  house, offer good sacrifices to the eternal gods.'      Fragment #2--Plutarch Mor. 1034 E: 'Decide no suit until you have heard  both sides speak.'      Fragment #3--Plutarch de Orac. defectu ii. 415 C: 'A chattering crow  lives out nine generations of aged men, but a stag's life is four times  a crow's, and a raven's life makes three stags old, while the phoenix  outlives nine ravens, but we, the rich-haired Nymphs, daughters of Zeus  the aegis-holder, outlive ten phoenixes.'      Fragment #4--Quintilian, i. 15: Some consider that children under the  age of seven should not receive a literary education... That Hesiod  was of this opinion very many writers affirm who were earlier than the  critic Aristophanes; for he was the first to reject the \"Precepts\", in  which book this maxim occurs, as a work of that poet.          THE GREAT WORKS (fragments)    Fragment #1--Comm. on Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics. v. 8: The verse,  however (the slaying of Rhadamanthys), is in Hesiod in the \"Great Works\"  and is as follows: 'If a man sow evil, he shall reap evil increase; if  men do to him as he has done, it will be true justice.'      Fragment #2--Proclus on Hesiod, Works and Days, 126: Some believe that  the Silver Race (is to be attributed to) the earth, declaring that in  the \"Great Works\" Hesiod makes silver to be of the family of Earth.        THE IDAEAN DACTYLS (fragments)    Fragment #1--Pliny, Natural History vii. 56, 197: Hesiod says that those  who are called the Idaean Dactyls taught the smelting and tempering of  iron in Crete.      Fragment #2--Clement, Stromateis i. 16. 75: Celmis, again, and  Damnameneus, the first of the Idaean Dactyls, discovered iron in Cyprus;  but bronze smelting was discovered by Delas, another Idaean, though  Hesiod calls him Scythes [1501].          THE THEOGONY (1,041 lines)    (ll. 1-25) From the Heliconian Muses let us begin to sing, who hold  the great and holy mount of Helicon, and dance on soft feet about the  deep-blue spring and the altar of the almighty son of Cronos, and, when  they have washed their tender bodies in Permessus or in the Horse's  Spring or Olmeius, make their fair, lovely dances upon highest Helicon  and move with vigorous feet. Thence they arise and go abroad by night,  veiled in thick mist, and utter their song with lovely voice, praising  Zeus the aegis-holder and queenly Hera of Argos who walks on golden  sandals and the daughter of Zeus the aegis-holder bright-eyed Athene,  and Phoebus Apollo, and Artemis who delights in arrows, and Poseidon  the earth-holder who shakes the earth, and reverend Themis and  quick-glancing [1601] Aphrodite, and Hebe with the crown of gold, and  fair Dione, Leto, Iapetus, and Cronos the crafty counsellor, Eos and  great Helius and bright Selene, Earth too, and great Oceanus, and dark  Night, and the holy race of all the other deathless ones that are  for ever. And one day they taught Hesiod glorious song while he was  shepherding his lambs under holy Helicon, and this word first the  goddesses said to me--the Muses of Olympus, daughters of Zeus who holds  the aegis:    (ll. 26-28) 'Shepherds of the wilderness, wretched things of shame,  mere bellies, we know how to speak many false things as though they were  true; but we know, when we will, to utter true things.'    (ll. 29-35) So said the ready-voiced daughters of great Zeus, and they  plucked and gave me a rod, a shoot of sturdy laurel, a marvellous thing,  and breathed into me a divine voice to celebrate things that shall be  and things there were aforetime; and they bade me sing of the race of  the blessed gods that are eternally, but ever to sing of themselves both  first and last. But why all this about oak or stone? [1602]    (ll. 36-52) Come thou, let us begin with the Muses who gladden the great  spirit of their father Zeus in Olympus with their songs, telling  of things that are and that shall be and that were aforetime with  consenting voice. Unwearying flows the sweet sound from their lips,  and the house of their father Zeus the loud-thunderer is glad at the  lily-like voice of the goddesses as it spread abroad, and the peaks of  snowy Olympus resound, and the homes of the immortals. And they uttering  their immortal voice, celebrate in song first of all the reverend race  of the gods from the beginning, those whom Earth and wide Heaven begot,  and the gods sprung of these, givers of good things. Then, next, the  goddesses sing of Zeus, the father of gods and men, as they begin and  end their strain, how much he is the most excellent among the gods  and supreme in power. And again, they chant the race of men and strong  giants, and gladden the heart of Zeus within Olympus,--the Olympian  Muses, daughters of Zeus the aegis-holder.    (ll. 53-74) Them in Pieria did Mnemosyne (Memory), who reigns over the  hills of Eleuther, bear of union with the father, the son of Cronos, a  forgetting of ills and a rest from sorrow. For nine nights did wise Zeus  lie with her, entering her holy bed remote from the immortals. And when  a year was passed and the seasons came round as the months waned, and  many days were accomplished, she bare nine daughters, all of one mind,  whose hearts are set upon song and their spirit free from care, a little  way from the topmost peak of snowy Olympus. There are their bright  dancing-places and beautiful homes, and beside them the Graces and  Himerus (Desire) live in delight. And they, uttering through their  lips a lovely voice, sing the laws of all and the goodly ways of the  immortals, uttering their lovely voice. Then went they to Olympus,  delighting in their sweet voice, with heavenly song, and the dark earth  resounded about them as they chanted, and a lovely sound rose up beneath  their feet as they went to their father. And he was reigning in heaven,  himself holding the lightning and glowing thunderbolt, when he had  overcome by might his father Cronos; and he distributed fairly to the  immortals their portions and declared their privileges.    (ll. 75-103) These things, then, the Muses sang who dwell on Olympus,  nine daughters begotten by great Zeus, Cleio and Euterpe, Thaleia,  Melpomene and Terpsichore, and Erato and Polyhymnia and Urania and  Calliope [1603], who is the chiefest of them all, for she attends on  worshipful princes: whomsoever of heaven-nourished princes the daughters  of great Zeus honour, and behold him at his birth, they pour sweet dew  upon his tongue, and from his lips flow gracious words. All the people  look towards him while he settles causes with true judgements: and he,  speaking surely, would soon make wise end even of a great quarrel; for  therefore are there princes wise in heart, because when the people are  being misguided in their assembly, they set right the matter again with  ease, persuading them with gentle words. And when he passes through  a gathering, they greet him as a god with gentle reverence, and he is  conspicuous amongst the assembled: such is the holy gift of the Muses to  men. For it is through the Muses and far-shooting Apollo that there are  singers and harpers upon the earth; but princes are of Zeus, and happy  is he whom the Muses love: sweet flows speech from his mouth. For though  a man have sorrow and grief in his newly-troubled soul and live in dread  because his heart is distressed, yet, when a singer, the servant of the  Muses, chants the glorious deeds of men of old and the blessed gods who  inhabit Olympus, at once he forgets his heaviness and remembers not his  sorrows at all; but the gifts of the goddesses soon turn him away from  these.    (ll. 104-115) Hail, children of Zeus! Grant lovely song and celebrate  the holy race of the deathless gods who are for ever, those that were  born of Earth and starry Heaven and gloomy Night and them that briny Sea  did rear. Tell how at the first gods and earth came to be, and rivers,  and the boundless sea with its raging swell, and the gleaming stars,  and the wide heaven above, and the gods who were born of them, givers  of good things, and how they divided their wealth, and how they  shared their honours amongst them, and also how at the first they took  many-folded Olympus. These things declare to me from the beginning, ye  Muses who dwell in the house of Olympus, and tell me which of them first  came to be.    (ll. 116-138) Verily at the first Chaos came to be, but next  wide-bosomed Earth, the ever-sure foundations of all [1604] the  deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympus, and dim Tartarus in  the depth of the wide-pathed Earth, and Eros (Love), fairest among the  deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise  counsels of all gods and all men within them. From Chaos came forth  Erebus and black Night; but of Night were born Aether [1605] and Day,  whom she conceived and bare from union in love with Erebus. And Earth  first bare starry Heaven, equal to herself, to cover her on every side,  and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods. And she  brought"]]]
