He became suddenly enraged.    \"You are trifling with me,\" he said furiously. \"Do you know the  penalty for that?\"    \"Why, yes,\" said Bell, and smiled amiably. \"A dose of--er--poison of  The Master's private brand.\"    It was a guess, but based on a good deal of evidence. Ribiera turned  crimson, then pale.    \"What do you know?\" he demanded in a deadly quietness. \"You cannot  leave this place. You are aware of that. The people here--guests and  servants--are my slaves, the slaves of The Master. You cannot leave  this place except also as my slave. I will have you bound and given  _yague_ so that you cannot fail to tell me anything that I wish to  know. I will have you tortured so that you will gladly say anything  that I wish, in return for death. I will--\"    \"You will,\" said Bell dryly, \"drop dead with seven bullets in your  body if you give a signal for anyone to attack me.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Ribiera stared at him as his hand rested negligently in his coat  pocket. And then, quite suddenly Ribiera began to chuckle. His rage  vanished. He laughed, a monstrous, gross, cackling laughter.    \"You have been my guest for two days,\" he gasped, slapping his fat  knees, \"and you have not noticed that your pistol his been tampered  with! Senhor Bell! Senhor Bell! My uncle will be disappointed in you!\"    It seemed to impress him as a victory that Bell had been depending  upon an utterly futile threat for safety. It restored his good humor  marvelously.    \"It does not matter,\" he said jovially. \"Presently you will tell me  all that I wish to know. More, perhaps. My uncle is pleased with you.  You recall your little talk with the wireless operator on the  _Almirante Gomez_? You tried to learn things from him, Senhor. He  reported it. Of course. All our slaves report. He sent his report to  my uncle, The Master, and I did not have it until to-day. I will admit  that you deceived me. I knew you had talked with Ortiz, who was a  fool. I thought that in his despair he might have spoken. I gave you  _yague_, as I thought, and informed my uncle that you knew nothing.  And he is very much pleased with you. It was clever to deceive me  about the _yague_. My uncle has high praise for you. He has told me  that he desires your services.\"    Bell inhaled again. There was no question but that Ribiera was totally  unafraid of the threat he had made. His gun must have been tampered  with, the firing-pin filed off perhaps. So Bell said placidly:    \"Well? He desires my services?\"           *       *       *       *       *    Ribiera chuckled, in his gross and horrible good humor.    \"He will have them. Senhor. He will have them. When you observe your  hands writhing at the ends of your wrists, you will enter his service,  through me. Of course. And he will reward you richly. Money, much  money, such as I have. And slaves--such as I have. The Senhora....\"    Ribiera looked at the terrified girl standing thirty or forty feet  away. He chuckled again.    \"My uncle desires that you should be induced to enter his service of  your own will. So, Senhor, you shall see first what my uncle's service  offers. And later, when you know what pleasures you may some day  possess as my uncle's deputy in your own nation, why, then the fact  that your hands are writhing at the ends of your wrists will be merely  an added inducement to come to me. And I bear you no ill will for  deceiving me. You may go.\"    Bell rose.    \"And still,\" he said dryly, \"I suspect that you are deceived. But now  you deceive yourself.\"    He heard Ribiera chuckling as he walked away. He heard him call,  amusedly, \"Senhora.\" He heard the little gasp of terror with which the  girl obeyed. He passed her, stumbling toward the gross fat man with  the light brown skin and curly hair. Her eyes were literally pools of  anguish.           *       *       *       *       *    Bell threw away his cigarette and began to fumble for another. He was  beginning to feel the first twinges of panic, and fought them down.  Ribiera had not lied. Bell had been at this _fazenda_ of his--which  was almost a miniature Versailles three hundred miles from Rio--for  two days. In all that time he had not seen one person besides himself  who did not display the most abject terror of Ribiera. Ribiera had  made no idle boast when he said that everyone about, guests and  servants, were slaves. They were. Slaves of a terror vastly greater  than mere fear of death. It--    \"Senhor!... _Oh, Dios!_\" It was the girl's voice, in despair.    Ribiera laughed. Bell felt a red mist come before his eyes.    He deliberately steadied his hands and lighted his cigarette. He heard  stumbling footsteps coming behind him. A hand touched his arm. He  turned to see the girl Ribiera had pointed out, her cheeks utterly,  chalky white, trying desperately to smile.    \"Senhor!\" she gasped. \"Smile at me! For the love of God, smile at me!\"    In the fraction of a second, Bell was mad with rage. He understood,  and he hated Ribiera with a corrosive hatred past conception. And then  he was deathly calm, and wholly detached, and he smiled widely, and  turned and looked at Ribiera, and Ribiera's whole gross bulk quivered  as he chuckled. Bell took the girl's arm with an excessive politeness  and managed--he never afterward understood how he managed it--to grin  at Ribiera.    \"Senhora,\" he said in a low tone, \"I think I understand. Stop being  afraid. We can fool him. Come and walk with me and talk. The idea is  that he must think you are trying to fascinate me, is it not?\"    She spoke through stiffened lips.    \"Ah, that I could die!\"    Bell had a horrible part to play while he walked the length of the  formal garden with her, and found a pathway leading out of it, and led  her out of sight. He stopped.    \"Now,\" he said sharply, \"tell me. I am not yet his slave. He has  ordered you....\"    She was staring before her with wide eyes that saw only despair.    \"I--I am to persuade you to be my lover,\" she said dully, \"or I shall  know the full wrath of The Master....\"           *       *       *       *       *    Bell asked questions, crisply, but as gently as he could.    \"We are his slaves,\" she told him apathetically. \"I and _mi  Arturo_--my husband. Both of us....\" She roused herself little under  Bell's insistent questioning. \"We were guests at his house at dinner.  Our friends, people high in society and in the Republic, were all  about us. We suspected nothing. We had heard nothing. But two weeks  later Arturo became irritable. He said that he saw red spots before  his eyes. I also. Then Arturo's hands writhed at the ends of his  wrists. He could not control them. His nerves were horrible. And mine.  And we--we have a tiny baby.... And Senhor Ribiera called upon my  husband. He was charming. He observed my husband's hands. He had a  remedy, he said. He gave it to my husband. He became normal again. And  then--my hands writhed. Senhor Ribiera told my husband that if he  would bring me to him.... And I was relieved. We were grateful. We  accepted the invitation of the Senhor Ribiera to this place. And he  showed us a man, in chains. He--he went mad before our eyes. He was a  member of the United States Secret Service.... And then the Senhor  Ribiera told us that we faced the same fate if we did not serve  him....\"           *       *       *       *       *    Bell had thrust aside rage as useless, now. He was deliberately cold.    \"And so?\"    \"It is a poison,\" she said unsteadily. \"A deadly, a horrible poison  which drives men murder mad in two weeks from the time of its  administration. The Senhor Ribiera has an antidote for it. But mixed  with the antidote, which acts at once, is more of the horrible poison,  which will act in two weeks more. So that we are entrapped. If we  disobey him....\"    Bell began to smile slowly, and not at all mirthfully.    \"I think,\" he said softly, \"that I shall gain a great deal of pleasure  from killing the Senhor Ribiera.\"    \"_Dios_--\" She strangled upon the word. \"Do you not see, Senhor, that  if he dies we--we--\" She stopped and choked. \"We--have a tiny baby,  Senhor. We--we would....\"    Again sick rage surged up in Bell. To kill Ribiera meant to drive his  slaves mad, and mad in the most horrible fashion that can be imagined.  To kill Ribiera meant to have these people duplicate the death of  Ortiz, as their greatest hope, or to fill madhouses with snarling  animals lusting to kill....    \"It is--it is not only I, Senhor,\" said the girl before him. She was  utterly listless, and in the agony of despair. \"It is Arturo, also.  The Senhor Ribiera has said that if I do not persuade you, that both  Arturo and I.... And our little baby, Senhor!... Our families also  will be entrapped some day. He has said so.... He will give that  poison to our baby.... And it will grow up either his slave, or--\"    Her eyes were pools of panic.    \"Oh, God!\" said Bell very quietly. \"And he's offering me this power!  He's trying to persuade me to become like him. He's offering me  pleasures!\"           *       *       *       *       *    He laughed unpleasantly. And then he went sick with helplessness. He  could kill Ribiera, perhaps, and let only God know how many people go  mad. Perhaps. Or perhaps Ribiera would merely be supplanted by another  man. Ortiz had said that he killed The Master's deputy in Buenos  Aires, but that another man had taken his place. And the thing went  on. And The Master desired a deputy in the United States....    \"Somehow,\" said Bell very softly, \"this has got to be stopped.  Somehow. Right away. That devilish stuff! Can you get hold of a bit of  the antidote?\" he asked abruptly. \"The merest drop of it?\"    She shook her head.    \"No, Senhor. It is given in food, in wine. One never knows that one  has had it. It is tasteless, and we have only Senhor Ribiera's word  that it has been given.\"    Bell's hands clenched.    \"S"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29816"],[0,"The Industries of Animals (#13)"],[1," which they can derive from their own  organs.    I have spoken of the Apes and described how they defend themselves  with their hands and teeth; but in certain cases they use weapons,  employing foreign objects like a club or like projectiles.    Acts of this nature are considered to indicate a high degree of  development, and it has often been repeated that they are the appanage  of man alone; we have, however, seen the _Toxotes_, who, like all  fishes, is not particularly intelligent, squirt water on to his  victims. It is not easy to understand how a greater intellectual  effort is required to throw a stone with the hand than to project  water with the mouth. This is what the apes do, throwing on their  assailants from the heights of trees everything which comes to hand:  cocoa-nuts, hard fruits, fragments of wood, etc.    Baboons (_Cynocephali_) who usually live in the midst of rocks protect  their retreat by rolling very heavy blocks on to their aggressors, or  by forcibly throwing stones about the size of the fist. As these bands  may contain from a hundred to one hundred and fifty individuals, it is  a veritable hail of stones of all sizes which they roll down from the  heights of the mountains where they find shelter.    _Sentinels._--Not only do Apes know how to face danger or to avoid it  by a prudent flight, but they also seek to foresee it, and to avoid  exposing themselves to it. A troop of Apes, according to Brehm,  generally places the leadership in the hands of a robust and  experienced male. This primitive royalty is founded partly on the  confidence inspired by an old chief, and partly by the fear inspired  by his muscular arms and ferocious canine teeth. (Fig. 9.) He gives  himself a great deal of trouble for the security of his subjects, and  does not abuse the authority which he possesses. Always at the head,  he leaps from branch to branch, and the band follows him. From time to  time he scales a tall tree, and from its heights scrutinises the  neighbourhood. If he discovers nothing suspicious a particular  guttural grunt gives information to his companions. If, on the  contrary, he perceives some danger he warns them by another cry, and  all draw in ready to follow him in his retreat, which he directs in  the same way as he guided the forward march.    Apes are not alone in relying on the experience of one of their  members. Many other animals act in the same way: antelopes, gazelles,  elephants, who advance in troops always conducted by an old male or  female who knows all the forest paths, all the places favourable to  pasture, and all the regions which must be avoided.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    Others, more democratic, instead of giving up the care of their safety  to one individual, which cannot be done without abdicating some degree  of individual independence, dispose around the place which they occupy  a certain number of sentinels charged to watch over the common safety.  This custom exists among prairie dogs, moufflons, crows, paroquets,  and a great many other animals. The sentinels of the crows are not  only always on the watch, but they are extremely discriminating; they  do not give a warning at the wrong time. It is certain that these  birds can distinguish a man armed with a gun from another who merely  carries a stick, and they allow the second to approach much nearer than  the first before giving the alarm.    Paroquets of all species live in joyous and noisy bands. After having  passed the night on the same tree they disperse in the neighbourhood,  not without having first posted watchers here and there, and they are  very attentive to their cries and indications.    The great Aras or Macaws, the large and handsome parrots of the Andes,  act with much prudence when circumstances make it advisable, and they  know when they ought to be on their guard. When they are in the depths  of the forest, their own domain, they gather fruits in the midst of a  deafening noise; each one squalls and cries according to his own  humour. But if they have resolved to pillage a field of maize, as  experience has taught them that these joyous manifestations would then  be unseasonable and would not fail to attract the furious proprietor,  they consummate the robbery in perfect silence. Sentinels are placed  on the neighbouring trees. To the first warning a low cry responds; on  the second, announcing a nearer danger, all the band fly away with  vociferations which need no longer be restrained. The common Crane  (_Grus cinerea_), still more far-seeing to avoid a possible future  danger, despatches scouts who are thus distinct from sentinels who  inform their fellows of present danger.[46]       [46] E. Poppig, _Fragmenta zoologica itineris Chilensis_,          1829-30.    When these birds have been disturbed in any spot, they never return  without great precautions. Before arriving, they stop; a few only go  circumspectly forward, examining everything, and coming back to make  their report. If this is not satisfactory the troop remains  suspicious, sending new messengers. When they are at last assured that  there is really nothing to fear, the rest follow.    Thus by the most varied methods animals endeavour to save their  threatened lives, and succeed to some extent in attaining safety.  Destruction and the chase on one side, conservation and flight on the  other: these are the two chief acts which occupy living beings. Many,  however, less threatened, succeed in perfecting their manner of life,  and employ their industry in less pressing occupations than eating  others or preventing others from eating them.          CHAPTER IV.    PROVISIONS AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS.        PROVISIONS LAID UP FOR A SHORT PERIOD--PROVISIONS LAID UP FOR      A LONG PERIOD--ANIMALS WHO CONSTRUCT BARNS--PHYSIOLOGICAL      RESERVES--STAGES BETWEEN PHYSIOLOGICAL RESERVES AND      PROVISIONS--ANIMALS WHO SUBMIT FOOD TO SPECIAL TREATMENT IN      ORDER TO FACILITATE TRANSPORT--CARE BESTOWED ON HARVESTED      PROVISIONS--AGRICULTURAL ANTS--GARDENING ANTS--DOMESTIC      ANIMALS OF ANTS--DEGREES OF CIVILISATION IN THE SAME SPECIES      OF ANTS--APHIS-PENS AND PADDOCKS--SLAVERY AMONG ANTS.      The industries of the chase which are derived immediately from the  most imperious of needs--that of assuring the existence of the  individual--never arrive at a very extraordinary degree of perfection;  or at all events, as they are indispensable to existence, we are not  surprised at their development. It is unquestionable that an industry  marks a higher degree of civilisation not only by its development, but  still more by its reference to the less necessary things of life; in  every species the importance of the place given to the superfluous is  a mark of superiority. The animals who, foreseeing a hard season, or  fearing the days when hunting will not be productive, lay up  provisions to utilise in such times of famine, rise a degree higher  than even the most skilful hunters. Not all amass with the same  sagacity, and we shall find different examples of foresight, from the  most rudimentary to the highest, very near what we may observe in Man.    The provisions harvested by animals have more than one destination:  some are for the individual himself who has gathered them; others, on  the contrary, are to serve as the food for his young at the age when  they are not yet capable of seeking their own food. I will deal with  these latter in another chapter, and propose at present only to speak  of those animals who provision barns with the intention of themselves  profiting by them.    The foresight of the animal is so much the greater the more remote the  future for which he prepares. The Carnivora live from day to day and  lay up no stores; it is the Rodents, certain frugivorous birds, and  insects who exhibit the most complicated acts of economy.    _Provisions laid up for a short period._--As a rudimentary example of  the art of preserving food in view of possible famine, I may mention  the case of the _Lanius collurio_. I have already spoken of this bird  and of his custom in days of abundance of spitting on thorns all the  captures he has made. One may see side by side Coleoptera, crickets,  grasshoppers, frogs, and small birds. It is evident that these  reserves cannot be preserved for more than a day, or at most two days.  The bird amasses just enough to show us his apprehensions of the  possible future lack of success in hunting, and his thought of  preserving the surplus of the present in view of privations to  come.[47]       [47] Naumann, _Naturgeschichte der Voegel Deutschlands_, etc.    The Fox, a very skilful hunter, has no trouble in finding game; of all  the Carnivora he is, however, the only one who is truly foreseeing.  The others in presence of abundant food gorge themselves, and abandon  the rest at the risk of suffering to-morrow. The fox is not so  careless. If he has had the good fortune to discover a poultry yard,  well supplied but ill watched, he carries away as many fowls as he can  before dawn and hides them in the neighbourhood of his burrow. He  places each by itself, one at the foot of a hedge, another beneath a  bush, a third in a hole rapidly hollowed out and closed up again. It  is said that he thus scatters his treasures to avoid the risk of  losing all at one stroke, although this prudence complicates his task  when he needs to utilise his provisions. The fox, however, loses  nothing, and knows very well where to find his stores. The very nature  of the game prevents him from keeping it more than a few days.    _Provisions laid up for a long period._--The Rodents, who live on dry  fruits or grains, can on the other hand preserve them for a long time  in their barns. The Squirrel, who may be seen all the summer leaping  like a little madman from branch to branch, and who seems to have no  cares except to exhibit his red fleece and show off his tail, is,  contrary to appearance, a most"]]]
