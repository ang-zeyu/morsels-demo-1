[PDP-10; often capitalized to ALT] Alternate name     for the ASCII ESC character (ASCII 0011011), after the keycap labeling     on some older terminals; also `altmode' (/awlt'mohd/). This character     was almost never pronounced `escape' on an ITS system, in [474]TECO,     or under TOPS-10 -- always alt, as in \"Type alt alt to end a TECO     command\" or \"alt-U onto the system\" (for \"log onto the [ITS] system\").     This usage probably arose because alt is more convenient to say than     `escape', especially when followed by another alt or a character (or     another alt and a character, for that matter). 4.

The Amiga was released just as the personal computing world     standardized on IBM-PC clones. This prevented it from gaining serious     market share, despite the fact that the first Amigas had a substantial     technological lead on the IBM XTs of the time. Instead, it acquired a     small but zealous population of enthusiastic hackers who dreamt of one     day unseating the clones (see [489]Amiga Persecution Complex). The     traits of this culture are both spoofed and illuminated in [490]The     BLAZE Humor Viewer. The strength of the Amiga platform seeded a small     industry of companies building software and hardware for the platform,     especially in graphics and video applications (see [491]video     toaster).       Due to spectacular mismanagement, Commodore did hardly any R&D,     allowing the competition to close Amiga's technological lead. After     Commodore went bankrupt in 1994 the technology passed through several     hands, none of whom did much with it. However, the Amiga is still     being produced in Europe under license and has a substantial number of     fans, which will probably extend the platform's life considerably.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:Amiga Persecution Complex, Next:[492]amoeba, Previous:[493]Amiga,     Up:[494]= A =       Amiga Persecution Complex n.       The disorder suffered by a particularly egregious variety of     [495]bigot, those who believe that the marginality of their preferred     machine is the result of some kind of industry-wide conspiracy (for     without a conspiracy of some kind, the eminent superiority of their     beloved shining jewel of a platform would obviously win over all,     market pressures be damned!) Those afflicted are prone to engaging in     [496]flame wars and calling for boycotts and mailbombings. Amiga     Persecution Complex is by no means limited to Amiga users; NeXT,     [497]NeWS, [498]OS/2, Macintosh, [499]LISP, and [500]GNU users are     also common victims.

The name is from     Tolkien's Pits of Angband (compare [524]elder days, [525]elvish). Has     been described as \"Moria on steroids\"; but, unlike Moria, many aspects     of the game are customizable. This leads many hackers and would-be     hackers into fooling with these instead of doing productive work.     There are many Angband variants, of which the most notorious is     probably the rather whimsical Zangband. In this game, when a key that     does not correspond to a command is pressed, the game will display     \"Type ? for help\" 50% of the time. The other 50% of the time, random     error messages including \"An error has occurred because an error of     type 42 has occurred\" and \"Windows 95 uninstalled successfully\" will     be displayed. Zangband also allows the player to kill Santa Claus (who     has some really good stuff, but also has a lot of friends), \"Bull     Gates\", and Barney the Dinosaur (but be watchful; Barney has a nasty     case of halitosis).

Let your nuptial hymns, your nuptial songs, greet him and his  Basileia! 'Twas in the midst of such festivities that the Fates formerly  united Olympian Here to the King who governs the gods from the summit  of his inaccessible throne. Oh! Hymen! oh! Hymenaeus! Rosy Eros with  the golden wings held the reins and guided the chariot; 'twas he, who  presided over the union of Zeus and the fortunate Here. Oh! Hymen! oh!
