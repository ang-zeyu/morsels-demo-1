Two hours  afterwards D'Artagnan returned.    \"Everything is arranged,\" he said; \"I saw his majesty at the very moment  he was setting off for the chase; the king expects us this evening.\"    \"The king expects _me!_\" cried Porthos, drawing himself up. It is a sad  thing to have to confess, but a man's heart is like an ocean billow;  for, from that very moment Porthos ceased to look at Madame Truchen  in that touching manner which had so softened her heart. Planchet  encouraged these ambitious leanings as best as he could. He talked over,  or rather gave exaggerated accounts of all the splendors of the last  reign, its battles, sieges, and grand court ceremonies. He spoke of the  luxurious display which the English made; the prizes the three brave  companions carried off; and how D'Artagnan, who at the beginning had  been the humblest of the four, finished by becoming the leader. He fired  Porthos with a generous feeling of enthusiasm by reminding him of his  early youth now passed away; he boasted as much as he could of the moral  life this great lord had led, and how religiously he respected the ties  of friendship; he was eloquent, and skillful in his choice of subjects.  He tickled Porthos, frightened Truchen, and made D'Artagnan think. At  six o'clock, the musketeer ordered the horses to be brought round, and  told Porthos to get ready. He thanked Planchet for his kind hospitality,  whispered a few words about a post he might succeed in obtaining for  him at court, which immediately raised Planchet in Truchen's estimation,  where the poor grocer--so good, so generous, so devoted--had become much  lowered ever since the appearance and comparison with him of the two  great gentlemen. Such, however, is a woman's nature; they are anxious  to possess what they have not got, and disdain it as soon as it is  acquired. After having rendered this service to his friend Planchet,  D'Artagnan said in a low tone of voice to Porthos: \"That is a very  beautiful ring you have on your finger.\"    \"It is worth three hundred pistoles,\" said Porthos.    \"Madame Truchen will remember you better if you leave her that ring,\"  replied D'Artagnan, a suggestion which Porthos seemed to hesitate to  adopt.    \"You think it is not beautiful enough, perhaps,\" said the musketeer. \"I  understand your feelings; a great lord such as you would not think of  accepting the hospitality of an old servant without paying him most  handsomely for it: but I am sure that Planchet is too good-hearted a  fellow to remember that you have an income of a hundred thousand francs  a year.\"    \"I have more than half a mind,\" said Porthos, flattered by the remark,  \"to make Madame Truchen a present of my little farm at Bracieux; it has  twelve acres.\"    \"It is too much, my good Porthos, too much just at present... Keep it  for a future occasion.\" He then took the ring off Porthos's finger, and  approaching Truchen, said to her:--\"Madame, monsieur le baron hardly  knows how to entreat you, out of your regard for him, to accept this  little ring. M. du Vallon is one of the most generous and discreet  men of my acquaintance. He wished to offer you a farm that he has at  Bracieux, but I dissuaded him from it.\"    \"Oh!\" said Truchen, looking eagerly at the diamond.    \"Monsieur le baron!\" exclaimed Planchet, quite overcome.    \"My good friend,\" stammered out Porthos, delighted at having been so  well represented by D'Artagnan. These several exclamations, uttered at  the same moment, made quite a pathetic winding-up of a day which might  have finished in a very ridiculous manner. But D'Artagnan was there,  and, on every occasion, wheresoever D'Artagnan exercised any control,  matters ended only just in the very way he wished and willed. There were  general embracings; Truchen, whom the baron's munificence had restored  to her proper position, very timidly, and blushing all the while,  presented her forehead to the great lord with whom she had been on such  very pretty terms the evening before. Planchet himself was overcome by  a feeling of genuine humility. Still, in the same generosity of  disposition, Porthos would have emptied his pockets into the hands of  the cook and of Celestin; but D'Artagnan stopped him.    \"No,\" he said, \"it is now my turn.\" And he gave one pistole to the woman  and two to the man; and the benedictions which were showered down  upon them would have rejoiced the heart of Harpagon himself, and have  rendered even him a prodigal.    D'Artagnan made Planchet lead them to the chateau, and introduced  Porthos into his own apartment, where he arrived safely without having  been perceived by those he was afraid of meeting.        Chapter VIII. The Presentation of Porthos at Court.    At seven o'clock the same evening, the king gave an audience to an  ambassador from the United Provinces, in the grand reception-room. The  audience lasted a quarter of an hour. His majesty afterwards received  those who had been recently presented, together with a few ladies, who  paid their respects first. In one corner of the salon, concealed behind  a column, Porthos and D'Artagnan were conversing together, waiting until  their turn arrived.    \"Have you heard the news?\" inquired the musketeer of his friend.    \"No!\"    \"Well, look, then.\" Porthos raised himself on tiptoe, and saw M. Fouquet  in full court dress, leading Aramis towards the king.    \"Aramis!\" said Porthos.    \"Presented to the king by M. Fouquet.\"    \"Ah!\" ejaculated Porthos.    \"For having fortified Belle-Isle,\" continued D'Artagnan.    \"And I?\"    \"You--oh, you! as I have already had the honor of telling you, are the  good-natured, kind-hearted Porthos; and so they begged you to take care  of Saint-Mande a little.\"    \"Ah!\" repeated Porthos.    \"But, happily, I was there,\" said D'Artagnan, \"and presently it will be  _my_ turn.\"    At this moment Fouquet addressed the king.    \"Sire,\" he said, \"I have a favor to solicit of your majesty. M.  d'Herblay is not ambitious, but he knows when he can be of service. Your  majesty needs a representative at Rome, who would be able to exercise  a powerful influence there; may I request a cardinal's hat for M.  d'Herblay?\" The king started. \"I do not often solicit anything of your  majesty,\" said Fouquet.    \"That is a reason, certainly,\" replied the king, who always expressed  any hesitation he might have in that manner, and to which remark there  was nothing to say in reply.    Fouquet and Aramis looked at each other. The king resumed: \"M. d'Herblay  can serve us equally well in France; an archbishopric, for instance.\"    \"Sire,\" objected Fouquet, with a grace of manner peculiarly his own,  \"your majesty overwhelms M. d'Herblay; the archbishopric may, in your  majesty's extreme kindness, be conferred in addition to the hat; the one  does not exclude the other.\"    The king admired the readiness which he displayed, and smiled, saying:  \"D'Artagnan himself could not have answered better.\" He had no sooner  pronounced the name than D'Artagnan appeared.    \"Did your majesty call me?\" he said.    Aramis and Fouquet drew back a step, as if they were about to retire.    \"Will your majesty allow me,\" said D'Artagnan quickly, as he led forward  Porthos, \"to present to your majesty M. le Baron du Vallon, one of the  bravest gentlemen of France?\"    As soon as Aramis saw Porthos, he turned as pale as death, while Fouquet  clenched his hands under his ruffles. D'Artagnan smiled blandly at  both of them, while Porthos bowed, visibly overcome before the royal  presence.    \"Porthos here?\" murmured Fouquet in Aramis's ear.    \"Hush! deep treachery at work,\" hissed the latter.    \"Sire,\" said D'Artagnan, \"it is more than six years ago I ought to have  presented M. du Vallon to your majesty; but certain men resemble stars,  they move not one inch unless their satellites accompany them. The  Pleiades are never disunited, and that is the reason I have selected,  for the purpose of presenting him to you, the very moment when you would  see M. d'Herblay by his side.\"    Aramis almost lost countenance. He looked at D'Artagnan with a proud,  haughty air, as though willing to accept the defiance the latter seemed  to throw down.    \"Ah! these gentlemen are good friends, then?\" said the king.    \"Excellent friends, sire; the one can answer for the other. Ask M. de  Vannes now in what manner Belle-Isle was fortified?\" Fouquet moved back  a step.    \"Belle-Isle,\" said Aramis, coldly, \"was fortified by that gentleman,\"  and he indicated Porthos with his hand, who bowed a second time.  Louis could not withhold his admiration, though at the same time his  suspicions were aroused.    \"Yes,\" said D'Artagnan, \"but ask monsieur le baron whose assistance he  had in carrying the works out?\"    \"Aramis's,\" said Porthos, frankly; and he pointed to the bishop.    \"What the deuce does all this mean?\" thought the bishop, \"and what sort  of a termination are we to expect to this comedy?\"    \"What!\" exclaimed the king, \"is the cardinal's, I mean this bishop's,  name _Aramis?_\"    \"His _nom de guerre_,\" said D'Artagnan.    \"My nickname,\" said Aramis.    \"A truce to modesty!\" exclaimed D'Artagnan; \"beneath the priest's robe,  sire, is concealed the most brilliant officer, a gentleman of the most  unparalleled intrepidity, and the wisest theologian in your kingdom.\"    Louis raised his head. \"And an engineer, also, it appears,\" he said,  admiring Aramis's calm, imperturbable self-possession.    \"An engineer for a particular purpose, sire,\" said the latter.    \"My companion in the musketeers, sire,\" said D'Artagnan, with great  warmth of manner, \"the man who has more than a hundred times aided your  father's ministers by his advice--M. d'Herblay, in a word, who, with  M. du Vallon, myself, and M. le Comte de la Fere, who is "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27118"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 2, April 1906 (#13)"],[1,"   RITA: From England?    FRIEDRICH: Yes, nothing lies in the way. And your mother will be  overjoyed.    RITA: Nay, nay.    FRIEDRICH: How well that you have taken a different name.    RITA: Ah, that is it. Yes, I believe that. Then they know that I am Rita  Revera.    FRIEDRICH: I wrote them. They will receive you with open arms. Erna! I  beg of you! I entreat you; come with me! It is still time. To-day. You  cannot know, but anybody from Rudolstadt who knows might come to the  theatre and----    RITA (_decidedly_): No one from Rudolstadt will do that. They are too  well trained for that. You see it by your own person. But go on! If I  would care to, if I really would return--what then?    FRIEDRICH: Then? Well, then, you would be in the midst of the family and  society again--and then----    RITA: And then?    FRIEDRICH: Then, after some time has elapsed and you feel at home and  when all is forgotten, as though nothing had ever happened----    RITA: But a great deal has happened.    FRIEDRICH: Erna, you must not take me for such a Philistine that I would  mind that. At heart I am unprejudiced. No, really, I know (_softly_) my  own fault, and I know Life. I know very well, and I cannot ask it of  you, that you, in a career like yours, you----    RITA: Hm?    FRIEDRICH: Well, that you should have remained entirely faultless. And I  do not ask it of you either.    RITA: You do well at that.    FRIEDRICH: I mean, whatever has happened within these four years--lies  beyond us, does not concern me--but shall not concern you any longer  either. Rita Revera has ceased to be--Erna Hattenbach returns to her  family.    RITA: Lovely, very lovely. Hm!--but then, what then? Shall I start a  cooking school?    FRIEDRICH (_with a gentle reproach_): But, Erna! Don't you understand  me? Could you think of anything else than---- Of course, I shall marry  you then.    (_Rita looks at him puzzled._)    FRIEDRICH: But that is self-evident. Why should I have looked you up  otherwise? Why should I be here? But, dear Erna, don't look so stunned.    RITA (_still stares at him_): \"Simply--marry.\" Strange. (_She turns  around towards the open piano, plays and sings softly_) Farilon, farila,  farilette.    FRIEDRICH (_has risen_): Erna! Do not torment me!    RITA: Torment? No. That would not be right. You are a good fellow. Give  me a kiss. (_She rises._)    FRIEDRICH (_embraces and kisses her_): My Erna! Oh, you have grown so  much prettier! So much prettier!    (_Rita leans her head on his shoulder._)    FRIEDRICH: But now come. Let us not lose one moment.    (_Rita does not move_.)    FRIEDRICH: If possible let everything be.... Come! (_He pushes her with  gentle force_) You cry?    RITA (_hastily wipes the tears from her eyes, controls herself_): O,  nonsense. Rita Revera does not cry--she laughs. (_Laughs forcedly._)    FRIEDRICH: Erna, do not use that name. I do not care to hear it again!    RITA: Oh--you do not want to hear it any more. You would like to command  me. You come here and assume that that which life and hard times have  made of me you can wipe out in a half hour! No! You do not know life and  know nothing of me. (_Harshly_) My name is Revera, and I shall not marry  a merchant from Rudolstadt.    FRIEDRICH: How is that? You still hesitate?    RITA: Do I look as though I hesitated? (_She steps up closer to him._)  Do you know, Fred, that during the years after my escape I often went  hungry, brutally hungry? Do you know that I ran about in the most  frightful dives, with rattling plate, collecting pennies and insults? Do  you know what it means to humiliate oneself for dry bread? You see; that  has been my school. Do you understand that I had to become an entirely  different person or go to ruin? One who owes everything to himself, who  is proud of himself, but who no longer respects anything, above all, no  conventional measures and weights? And do you understand, Fred, that it  would be base on my part were I to follow you to the Philistine?    FRIEDRICH (_after a pause, sadly_): No, I do not understand that.    RITA (_again gaily_): I thought so. Shall I dread there every suspicion  and tremble before every fool, whereas I can breathe free air, enjoy  sunshine and the best conscience. You know that pretty part in the  Walkuere? (_She sings_):           \"Greet Rudolstadt for me,       Greet my father and mother       And all the heroes....       I shall not follow you to them!\"      Now you know. (_She sits down at the piano again._)    FRIEDRICH (_after silence_): Even if you have lived through hard times,  that still does not give you the right to disregard the duties of morals  and customs.    RITA (_plays and sings_): \"Farilon, farila, farilette--\"    FRIEDRICH: I cannot understand how you can refuse me, when I offer you  the opportunity of returning to ordered circumstances.    RITA: I do not love the \"ordered\" circumstances. On the contrary, I must  have something to train.    FRIEDRICH: And I? I shall never be anything to you any more? You thrust  me also aside in your stubbornness.    RITA: But not at all. Why?    FRIEDRICH: How so? Did you not state just now that you would never marry  a merchant from Rudolstadt.    RITA: Certainly----    FRIEDRICH: Do you see? You cannot be so cold and heartless towards me?  (_Flattering_) Why did you kiss me before? I know you also yearn in your  innermost heart for those times in which we secretly saw and found each  other. You also, and, even if you deny it, I felt it before when you  cried. (_Softly_) Erna! Come along, come along with me! Come! Become my  dear wife!    RITA (_looks at him quietly_): No, I shall not do such a thing.    FRIEDRICH (_starts nervously; after a pause_): Erna! Is that your last  word?    RITA: Yes.    FRIEDRICH: Consider well what you say!    RITA: I know what I am about.    FRIEDRICH: Erna! You want--to remain what you are?    RITA: Yes. That's just what I want.    FRIEDRICH (_remains for some time struggling, then grasps his hat_):  Then--adieu! (_He hurries toward the left into the bedroom._)    RITA (_calls smiling_): Halt! Not there.    FRIEDRICH (_returns, confused_): Pardon me, I----    RITA: Poor Fred, did you stray into my bedroom? There is the door.  (_Long pause. Several times he tries to speak. She laughs gently. Then  she sings and plays the song from \"Mamselle Nitouche\"_):           A minuit, apres la fete,       Rev'naient Babet et Cadet;       Cristi! la nuit est complete,       Faut nous depecher, Babet.

By and by he becomes fascinated and finally is charmed. When  she finishes, he puts his stiff hat on the table and walks toward her  with a blissful smile._)    RITA: Now? You even smile? Did I impress you?    FRIEDRICH (_drops down on his knees in front of her_): Oh, Erna, you are  the most charming woman on earth. (_He kisses her hands wildly._)    RITA (_stoops down to him, softly and merrily_): Why run away? Why? If  you still love me, can you run off--you mule?    FRIEDRICH: Oh, I'll remain--I remain with you.    RITA: It was well that you missed the door.    FRIEDRICH: Oh, Erna----    RITA: But now you'll call me Rita--do you understand? Well? Are you  going to--are you going to be good?    FRIEDRICH: Rita! Rita! Everything you wish.    RITA: Everything I wish. (_She kisses him._) And now tell me about your  moral demand. Yes?
