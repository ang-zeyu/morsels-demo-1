But in a few cases there  _are_ colours or other features that remain persistent throughout the  three stages, or show themselves prominently in two.    An interesting example in point is that of the Magpie or Currant Moth  (page 279). The caterpillar of this moth is cream-coloured, with orange  stripes along the sides, and very bold black markings down the back. The  chrysalis, which is at first entirely yellow, afterwards turns black  with the exception of some yellow transverse bands. Then, the moth  exhibits the same colours as these two earlier stages, with the same  degree of boldness; for its pale cream-coloured wings, tinted with  patches of yellow, are marked with numerous deep black spots. Thus, in  this case, we find the same general character of the colouring  throughout the insect's existence.    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--THE PUPA OF THE CURRANT MOTH.]    [Illustration: FIG. 35.--PUPA OF THE PALE TUSSOCK MOTH (_Pudibunda_).]    Another interesting example, though not so striking as the last, is to  be found in the case of a group of moths known as the _Liparidae_. The  caterpillars of these are remarkable for their very hairy bodies, often  ornamented by several bold brush-like tufts. The chrysalides are also  hairy; and several of the moths themselves are not only thickly clad  with shaggy hair, but a bold tuft often tips the abdomen.    We must not leave these few remarks on the characters of chrysalides  without a mention of the brilliant spots of burnished gold that decorate  the pupae of certain butterflies. This is the feature that led to the  invention of the term _chrysalis_, which is derived from the Greek word  _chrysos_, meaning _gold_. For the same reason the term _aurelia_ has  been applied to the pupae of _Lepidoptera_, this being derived from  _aurum_--the Latin name for gold.    Strictly, then, these two terms apply only to the pupae of a certain  number of the butterflies; but the former is now generally used to  designate the pupae of all the _Lepidoptera_, and is even extended to the  corresponding stages of insects of other orders.    If you examine one of these gold-speckled chrysalides, the brilliant  metallic lustre seems to belong to the outer surface, just as if certain  spots had been tipped with real gold; but after the butterfly has  quitted its case the beautiful golden spots are gone. This proves that  the metallic appearance is not due to reflection from the outer surface  of the chrysalis, but to a reflection from some structure beneath it.  This latter is a very thin membrane which lies just under the outer  transparent covering of the chrysalis.    The period during which the _Lepidoptera_ remain in the chrysalis state  varies very considerably in different species, and also depends more or  less on the temperature. As a rule, when a caterpillar pupates before  the end of the summer, it remains dormant in the pupal condition for  only a few weeks; but, if late in the summer or in the autumn, it  remains in this condition throughout the winter, and emerges in the  following spring or early summer.    Both these conditions are illustrated in the life history of the Large  White or Cabbage Butterfly--an insect with which we have already become  acquainted. We get two distinct broods of this butterfly every year, the  first appearing in May and the second in August. The eggs of the first  brood hatch in about a fortnight, and the larvae are full grown about  four weeks later. These then change to chrysalides, from which the  perfect insects (the second brood) emerge in a few weeks--the period  varying slightly with the temperature of the season. From the eggs of  this second brood we get another invading army of cabbage eaters that  change to pupae late in the summer. These remain dormant till the  following April, and may be found in numbers throughout the winter,  attached to the walls and fences of kitchen and market gardens.    If, then, the pupae of the same species are so influenced by the  temperatures of the seasons, can we limit or prolong the period of  quiescence by subjecting them to high or low temperatures artificially  produced? Most certainly we can; and every practical entomologist knows  how to obtain the perfect butterflies and moths of certain species long  before their appointed times, or, if he desires it, to compel them to  remain in their dormant stage long after the natural period has  terminated.    Sometimes an enthusiastic insect hunter obtains a large number of what  we may term 'winter pupae,' by collecting and breeding various species.  He also anticipates a number of successful captures of perfect insects  during the following summer. Thus, from two distinct sources, he obtains  a goodly assortment of butterflies and moths, the setting, preserving,  and arranging of which entails an immense amount of home work.    Under such circumstances he will sometimes endeavour to cause some of  his pupae to emerge before their accustomed time, so that he may get some  of his insects 'on the boards' before his field work is in full swing,  and so avoid a rush, or prevent the loss of insects that will be spoiled  before he has time to take them in hand.    This process of hurrying up his pupae he calls 'forcing,' and simply  consists in keeping them for a time in a warm room or hothouse where the  high temperature is pretty constant.    On the other hand, the entomologist may desire to try the effect of a  continued _low_ temperature on his pupae. This he can do by placing his  pupae in an ice house. Such experiments have often been performed, and  the results are very interesting. In some cases the emergence of the  perfect insect has been delayed for many months, and even years; and  then, after an exposure to a normal temperature lasting only a week or  two, the winged insect has made its appearance just as if nothing  unusual had happened.    Such are the effects of _extreme_ temperatures on the duration of the  chrysalis state; and we naturally infer, from such results, that the  pupa under natural conditions is influenced, though in a lesser degree,  by the variations experienced with the seasons, especially in such a  fickle climate as our own.    The insect hunter has always to bear this in mind, and particularly so  when he sets out on a search for certain desired species. Suppose, for  example, he has set his mind on the capture of a certain butterfly that  _usually_ appears in the _first_ week in May. Before finally naming the  day, he has to consider what the weather has been during the last few  weeks, and if he finds that this has been much warmer than the average  for the corresponding periods in the past, he selects a day in _April_,  earlier or later according to the difference between the present season  and the average.    If he does not pay due attention to such considerations, he will  sometimes find that all the insects netted are shabby and much worn,  even though, under average conditions, he would be catching newly  emerged and brilliant specimens. This, then, will explain how it is that  we so often see in entomologists' periodicals startling accounts of  'early captures,' and of the appearance of certain insects late in the  season that _ought_ not to have emerged till the following summer.    I will give just one illustration of these variations. The beautiful  Orange Tip Butterfly (Plate I, fig. 7) generally appears about the  middle of May in the southern counties. Farther north it is of course a  little later. In the north of England it has been taken in June; and in  Scotland as late as July. On the other hand, I have taken it in  Gloucestershire as early as March, on a rather bleak day with a cold  east wind; and, withal, in a field on the slope of the Cotswolds fully  exposed to the unfavourable breeze; but it was evident that, in this  case, the butterfly had been enticed from its winter quarters by the  milder weather of the few previous weeks.    It may be as well, in passing, to observe that it is not only the pupa  that is influenced by temperature. The hatching of eggs may be forced by  high temperatures, or be retarded by exposure to cold; and in nature the  period of incubation varies with the seasons. The larvae, too, grow  faster or more slowly, or pupate earlier or later from similar causes.  And so no very definite date or period can be assigned to any one stage  of any insect.    Now let us return to one of the chrysalides that we have already watched  through the earlier stages of its existence, and follow it in its future  development.    It is now, as we say, in its quiescent or dormant condition, but we must  not suppose that it is always in a profound sleep, nor can we say that  it is insensible to its surroundings. Touch it gently or surprise it  with a puff of air from your mouth, and it will begin to wag its pointed  tail, sometimes with such vigour as to send the body rolling round and  round in its box. Lay it on a bed of cocoa-nut fibre or finely sifted  soil and let it remain _quite undisturbed_ for a few hours or days, and  you will probably find that, by occasional movements of its body, it has  made a slight depression in its bed, and lies partly submerged. I have  known some chrysalides to completely bury themselves in this way during  the course of a day or two, and others to partly expose themselves after  having been lightly covered. Others again, I have observed, will move  smartly if a strong light is suddenly turned on them. Many, too,  certainly appear to have a strong objection to exposure to the direct  rays of a hot sun; for, when thus exposed, they will struggle  persistently, as if to work their bodies into some shady corner. I would  not advise a young entomologist to try this experiment, however, if he  values the pupae he possesses, for direct sunlight is undoubtedly very  harmful to many species, and perhaps it is to all.    Some chrysalides are not nearly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#13)"],[1,"and  head swollen; standing with the head against a fence or barn; eyes dull  and sunken, and horns cold.    _Remedies._--Bleed and physic, shelter and feed properly.    Take a half pint of good vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of salt, one  teaspoonful of pepper, and mix and pour into each ear, holding the head  on one side for two minutes.    Bore with a large gimlet on the under side of the horn, three or four  inches from the head; and if hollow, bore nearer the head and let out  all the matter, and syringe two or three times a day with salt and  water, or soap-suds, or salt and vinegar.    Spirits of turpentine rubbed in around the base of the horns, will  arrest the disease in its incipient stages.    Pour a spoonful of boiling hot brimstone into the cavity between the  horns.    Pour a teakettle of boiling water on the horns, holding so as to prevent  injury to the other parts.    Soot and pepper given internally are good.      Jaundice, or Yellows.    This is owing to gall-stones or calculi, which occasionally accumulate  in large numbers, and is sometimes owing to increased or altered quality  of the bile. It is manifested by the yellowness of the eye and skin, and  high color of the urine, and poor appetite.    _Remedies._--Bleed, and purge with Epsom salts.    If taken in season, 2 ounces of ground mustard may be mixed with a  liquid, and given twice a day.    Green food is a good preventive.      Mad Itch.    This disease exists in some of the Western states, and shows itself by  jerking of the head, and itching around the nose and base of the horns.  They will lick their sides and backs, and jerk and hiccup till they fill  themselves with wind; afterwards they froth at the mouth, and in 24  hours die raving mad.    _Remedy._--Give as much soot and salt as the animal will eat; soon  after, give 3/4 or 1 lb. of brimstone or sulphur; and 8 hours after, as  many salts.      Bloody Murrain, or Red Water.    This disease first shows itself in a cough, then heaving of the flanks,  with bloody, black, and f[oe]tid evacuations, tenderness over the loins,  and coldness of the horns. Tumors and biles sometimes appear. The animal  holds down the head, moans, is restless, and staggers when walking.    _Causes._--We have lost several animals by this fatal disease, and are  not aware of having cured any when severely attacked. In repeated  instances, we have seen large flukes taken out of the liver, strongly  resembling the common leech, which abounds in many of our swampy lands.  It is certain that on new, low swamps and clay lands, cattle are most  liable to it; and when they have been subject to repeated attacks in  such localities, clearing and draining have checked it.    Youatt attributes it to certain kinds of forage, which are peculiar to  the above situations. We are rather inclined to ascribe it to exposure,  to excessive dampness, and especially to miasma; for although the brute  creation are perhaps less sensitive to these influences than man, yet,  as they are governed by the same unvarying laws of nature, when  subjected to conditions totally unsuited to their economy, they must  suffer equally in kind, though probably not in degree, with the more  refined human frame. But it is evident the disease, its causes, and  remedies, are as yet imperfectly understood.    _Remedies._--However intelligent men may differ as to its causes, all  agree that the animal should first be bled, and then thoroughly purged.  In obstinate cases, this last is a difficult matter. We have given  repeated doses of powerful cathartics without producing any effect; and  whenever the medicine is inoperative, death speedily follows.    Large doses of common salt, or Epsom salts dissolved in water, are good  purgatives, and if the animal neglects drinking after taking them, he  should be drenched with copious draughts of water. These should be  repeated every few hours, if ineffectual.    Injections are sometimes useful, when medicine fails to act. These may  be made of soap and water; or take 2 or 3 gills of oats boiled, 3  drachms saltpetre, 11/2 oz. linseed oil, mix and use them when warm.    The opening of the bowels may be followed with a pint of linseed oil, as  an additional and gentle laxative.    When the animal begins to recover, gentle astringents and tonics may be  given.    _Preventives._--We have more confidence in preventives than in remedies.  Good keep, shelter, dryness, and clean pastures, will generally prevent  attack. The cattle should at all times be supplied with two or three  troughs under cover, on the sides and bottoms of which tar should be  plentifully spread. Let equal portions of salt and slaked lime be in  one; salt and wood ashes in another; and salt and brimstone in a third.  Many farmers have entirely avoided this disease while using one or more  of these, when they annually lost many by it previously.      Hoof Ail    Is indicated by lameness, fever, and a soft swelling just above the  hoof.    _Remedies._--Carefully wash the foot in warm soap-suds, and while still  damp, apply between the claws on the affected part from one to three  grains of corrosive sublimate. If it does not fully adhere, it must be  mixed with hog's lard, but it should be so applied as to be out of the  reach of the animal's tongue, as it is a powerful poison, and the  extreme irritability of the feet will induce him to lick them.    The claw is efficiently cleansed, by drawing a cord briskly through it,  when either of the above applications, or blue vitriol put on two or  three times a day, or spirits of turpentine, will effect a cure.    It is sometimes cured by putting the animals in the stanchions, and  applying a sharp chisel three-fourths of an inch from the toe, and  striking it with a mallet till it is cut off. If it does not bleed  freely, cut off shavings till it does. If the animal is refractory, let  a person hold up the opposite foot. Keep them in the stable two or three  days, and out of the mud for a week.      Loss of Cud    Is loss of appetite, prostration, and general ill-health.    _Remedies._--Give a warm bran mash, with good hay, and warm water with  salt.    An aloe tincture, made with brandy and ginger, is good.    Afterwards give good, dry, nourishing food; and bitter infusions,  chamomile flowers, hoarhound, oak bark, &c., in beer.      Scours, or Diarrh[oe]a.    A common remedy, is to boil the bark of white oak, white pine, and  beech, and give a strong infusion in bran. If they refuse to eat it,  pour it down. The oak is astringent, and the pine and beech soothing and  healing.      Warbles    Are grubs, the egg of which is deposited in the back of cattle by the  gad-fly, (_[OE]strus bovis._) They are discernible by a protuberance or  swelling on the back. They may be pressed out by the thumb and finger;  or burnt out by plunging a hot wire in them; or a few applications of  strong brine will remove them.      Wounds    In cattle are readily healed, when the animal's blood is in good order,  by applying a salve made of 1 oz. green copperas; 2 oz. white vitriol; 2  oz. salt; 2 oz. linseed oil; 8 oz. molasses. Boil over a slow fire 15  minutes in a pint of urine, and when almost cold, add 1 oz. oil of  vitriol, and 4 oz. spirits turpentine. Apply it with a feather to the  wound, and cure soon follows.      Milk, or Puerperal Fever,    Is a common disease with cows in high condition, at the time of calving.  It may, in almost every case, be avoided, by keeping them in moderate  feed and flesh.    _Remedies._--Bleed freely, say 6 to 10 quarts, according to the  circulation of the blood; then give 1 to 11/2 lbs. of Epsom salts,  according to the size of the beast, to be repeated in half lb. doses  every six hours, till she purges freely.    Injections should always be given when purgatives are tardy in their  operation.      Caked Bag    May be removed by simmering the bark of the root of bitter-sweet in  lard, till it becomes very yellow. When cool, apply it to the swollen  udder once in 8 or 10 hours; or wash it several times a day in cold  water.    A pint of horseradish, fed once a day, cut up with potatoes or meal, is  useful for the same purpose.    This is also a tonic, helps the appetite, and is good for oxen subject  to heat.      Garget    Is a more intense degree of inflammation than exists in caked bag and  sore, swollen teats, and shows itself in hard bunches on the udder.    The cow should be bled, and take a large dose of physic; then wash the  udder as in caked bag.    Repeated doses of sulphur is a good remedy.    Garget, or scoke root, given of the size of a large finger, grated and  fed in their food, is a general application with farmers. The garget  plant grows from three to six feet high, with a purple stalk, and  strings of berries hanging down between the branches.      Sore Teats    May be healed by rubbing with goose oil, cream, new milk; or make the  same applications for it as for caked bag. The bag and teats should be  well cleansed with warm soft water, if to be followed by any ointment.    The following application is recommended by Youatt: One ounce of yellow  wax and three of lard; melt together, and when cooling, rub in one  quarter ounce of sugar of lead, and a drachm of alum finely powdered.      Warts    Are of two kinds; the first, on the outer skin, may be removed by  rubbing with camphorated olive oil. The others penetrate into the flesh,  and may be removed by a ligature of fine twine, or silk, or india-rubber  drawn into a string, and tied tightly around the wart, which falls off  in a few days.    _Remedies._--Nitrate of silver, (lunar caustic,) applied to the wart,  will remove it, but it produces a sore.    Apply a strong wash of alum.    Rub with the juice of milk-weed.    Poultice with grated carrot.    Cut off the wart with sharp scissors, when the cow is dry. It will bleed  little, and soon heal.      Sore Necks on Working Oxen.    These occur when"]]]
