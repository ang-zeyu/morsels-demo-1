But he seemed quite unconscious  of the multitude of bullocks that, scattered all over the paddock,  were laying in a fresh supply of grass.    \"It's Moriarty,\" sighed Thompson, gazing at the horseman.  \"He's been sent to catch us.  It's all up.\"    Then, like the sound of many waters, rose the mingled sentiments  of the company, as each man dragged on his boots with a celerity  beyond description.    \"You keep him on a string, Collins, while we coller  as many of the carrion as we\"----    \"What use?  It's a summonsing match already.  Look at the fence!  And Martin lives in the hut after all.  He's between us and the bullocks now--  laughing at us.  What business had we to travel on\"----    \"Demmit suggest something.  Make use of me in this emergency,  I beg of you.  Shall I\"----    \"Port Phillip, all over.  Jist let me deliver this (adj.) load.  That's all I\"----    \"Comes o' young pups knowin' heverythink.  I kep' misdoubtin'  all the (adj.) time\"----    \"Are you fellows mad?\" shouted the young storekeeper,  as he dashed past the group, and pulled his blown horse round in a circle.  \"Out with those bullocks as quick as the devil'll let you!  Martin's on top of you! I've just given him the slip! We were sent  from the station expressly to nip you.  Fly round! blast you, fly round!\"    At the word, Cooper and Thompson snatched up their bridles and darted off,  followed by Price and Willoughby.  Dixon and Bum were not in the crowd,  but no one had leisure just then to notice their absence.    \"Len's yer horse, like a good feller,\" said Mosey hastily.    \"To (sheol) with your cheek!\" snapped Moriarty.  \"What next I wonder?\"  Mosey snatched up his bridle, and went off at a run.  \"Hello, Collins!  I didn't notice you in the hurry.  Bright cards, ain't they? Nothing short  of seven years'll satisfy them.  You've been travelling all night?\"    \"No; I camped here with the teams.\"    \"I thought when I saw the saddled horse, that you had just turned him in  to get a bite.\"    \"He's not saddled.  There's my saddle.\"    \"I thought that was your horse--that black one with the new saddle on.\"  (I should explain that Moriarty, being mounted, could see across  the old-man salt-bush, which I could not.) \"But I say,\" he continued;  \"what do you mean by stopping here instead of making for the station?  I've a dash good mind to tell Mrs. Beaudesart.  Why, it's two months  since you parted from her.\"    \"Where's Martin?\" I asked.    \"I left him at the ram-paddock, trying to track his horse.  I suppose you haven't heard that he lives here now?\"    \"Well, we heard that some one was being sent to live here.  By the way,  Moriarty, you better keep out of sight of that fellow at the hut\"    \"No odds.  It's only Daddy Montague; he can't see twenty yards.  But I say--Mrs. Beaudesart is sorting out her own old wedding toggery;  she knows you'll never have money enough to\"----    \"How does Martin come to be at the ram-paddock, if he lives here?\"  I interrupted.    \"I'll tell you the whole rigmarole,\" replied the genial ass.  \"Martin was at the station yesterday, crawling after Miss King,  when up comes a sandy-whiskered hound of a contractor, name of M'Nab,  to see about the specifications of the new fence between us and Nalrooka;  and this (fellow)'s idea of getting on the soft side of Montgomery,  about the fence, was to nearly break his neck running to tell him that Price,  and Thompson, and a whole swag of other fellows, intended to work on  the ram-paddock that night.  That would be last night, of course.  Now, Montgomery doesn't bark about a night's grass out of the ram-paddock  at this time of year, in case of emergency; but he does n't believe in people\\  driving expressly for it; and besides, he badly wants to catch  Price and Thompson, and make an example of them.  Well, it happened  that he had thought out early jobs for all the rest of the fellows,  so what does he do--Sunday and all--but he rouses out Martin and me,  and tells us to go to the ram-paddock, and quietly round up all the bullocks,  and bring them to the station.  No hurry, of course, so I got playing cards  with some of the shearers, and Martin got yarning with the old wool-classer;  and we timed ourselves to be at the ram-paddock just before daylight.  Of course, the right plan would have been to go through the ration-paddock,  and in by the Quondong gate; and that was what I wanted to do.  Then we could have made a circuit of the ram-paddock, inside the fence,  and given it a good rough overhaul.  But because I proposed this,  Martin insisted on going by the main road, for better riding,  and to see if we could find the wagons, as a sort of guide.  Sensible to the last.  Well, he would have it his own way,  and I didn't give a curse, so on we went; and just as we were crossing  the sort of hollow at this near corner of the ram-paddock,  the God-forsaken old fool thought he heard cattle in the timber.  So we tied our horses at the fence, and walked across to see.  Nothing there, of course, only imagination and kangaroos.  We stayed about ten minutes--me moralising about fools, and him sulking--  and when we came back to where we had left our horses, mine was there  by himself.  Martin was dancing mad, for his horse was never known  to break a bridle, and he did n't know who to blame for making away with him.  However, I was n't any way interested in mustering the ram-paddock,  and Martin wanted his horse, so we hunted round and round,  but devil a smell of horse or saddle or bridle could we find in the dark.  After a while, daylight came, and I caught sight of the wool,  and tumbled to the little game.  Of course, I ripped across to give the fellows  the office, praying and cursing fit to break my neck.  What the dickens  induced them to run the risk of duffing here?  Maddest thing I ever knew.  Martin has been living here since this day week; and his greatest pleasure  in life is prowling round when he ought to be asleep.\"    \"Warrigal Alf laid Mosey on,\" I replied.  \"At least, he said he had stayed here  the night before last, and had taken his bullocks out after they lay down.\"    \"Ah! the treacherous beggar! I'll tell you how that came.  Day before yesterday--let's see--that was Saturday--Montgomery and Martin  met Alf just at the station, coming along behind some other teams.  Montgomery was sorry in his own mind for a blaggarding he gave Alf last winter,  for letting his bullocks get into our horse-paddock.  Seems they got adrift  from Bottara, while Alf was unloading, and had gone the thirty miles,  right across country, with him after them full chase.  Alf was too ill-natured  to explain things at the time:  and he never mentioned it when he loaded  our first wool, a month ago.  Montgomery heard the truth of it  only the other day; so when he met Alf, he stopped him, and mentioned it,  and told him to shove his bullocks in Martin's paddock for that night,  as grass was so scarce.  It must have cut Martin to the bone  to see a kindly thing done, but he had to grin and bear it--  treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath, as Shakespear says.\"    \"Then Martin may be here any minute?\"    \"Well, I left him a little better than two mile away, trying to track  his horse, and he can't track worth a dash.  Certainly, he was headed  toward the station the last I saw of him.  But if he's got a spare saddle  at home here, he's pretty certain to come for a fresh horse,  to hunt up the other.  I'd give five notes, if I had it, to see these (fellows)  yoked up and off; for if Martin catches them, there'll be (sheol) to pay,  and no pitch hot; and, by George! there's not half a second to lose.  Just look at that fence! Ah! here they come! Good lads! Well,  take care of yourself, Tom, and give us a call at the station  as soon as you can.  I'll keep out of sight till these chaps are started;  then I'll have a bit of breakfast with Daddy Montague, and invent  a good watertight lie, and do a skulk for an hour or two,  and then dodge on to the station as slowly as possible.  I want something  to go wrong in the store while Montgomery has charge himself;  it'll learn him to appreciate me better.  I'll have to ram it down his throat  that the fellows had their bullocks out before I got here.\"    \"Wait, Moriarty--what's Martin's horse like?  I might see him.\"    \"Liver-colour; star and snip; white hind feet; bang tail.  One of the best mokes on the station.  Belongs to Martin himself.  I hope he'll scratch the bridle off, and roll on the saddle  till it's not worth a cuss.  I say--if Martin should find his way here  before the fellows get clear, will you just tell him I fancied I saw his horse  going for the Connelly paddock, and I shot after him hell-for-leather.  No message for Mrs. Beaudesart?  Well, so long.\" And the good and faithful  young servant cantered away toward an adjacent cane-grass swamp.    I was picking up my possum rug and saddle, when I heard Dixon's voice,  in earnest entreaty.  Looking round, I saw him sitting  on the edge of his hammock.    \"Say, Collins--will you fetch my (adj.) bullocks, while yer hand's in?  I can't har'ly move this mornin'.\"    \"Yes, Dixon; I won't see you beat, if I can help it.  What's the matter?\"    \"Well, I was on top o' my load las' night, gittin'--gittin' some tobacker  an' matches; an' I come a buster on top o' one o' the yokes here.  It's put a (adj.) set on me, any road.\"    With a few words of condolence, I entered the paddock, carrying my saddle  and bridle.  As I came in sight of Cleopatra, I was constrained  to pause and reflect.  The horse was feeding composedly, saddled and bridled;  a pair of hobbles hanging to the saddle.  The bridle was a cheap affair,  but the saddle was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34736"],[0,"True Christianity (#13)"],[1,"poison in the venomous  worm, ready to break forth into open acts of sin, whenever an occasion  presents itself.    8. Learn, then, O man! to know the fall of Adam, and the true nature of  Original Sin. Learn, if thou art wise, to discern it in thyself. Examine  it, not slightly and carelessly, but deeply, and as the importance of the  matter deserves; for this infection is greater, this depravation deeper  and more deadly, than can possibly be expressed by words, or even be  conceived in idea. \"Know thyself!\" and deeply consider what thou art, O  man! since the fall of thy first father; how thou, who wast in the image  of God, art become the image of Satan, an epitome of all his wicked  tendencies, and art conformed to Satan in all malice and ungodliness. For  as in the image of God all the divine virtues and properties are  contained, so in the image of the Devil, which man, by turning himself  from God, has contracted, all the vices and properties are to be found,  and the very nature of the Devil himself. For, as man, before the fall,  bore the image of the heavenly Adam, that is, was altogether heavenly,  spiritual, and divine; so, since the first apostasy, he carries about with  him the image of the earthly Adam, being inwardly earthly, carnal, and  corrupt.    9. Lo! he is become as one of the beasts of the field. For what, O fallen  man! is thy wrathfulness? and to whom does it more properly belong, to the  lion, or to man? And do not thine envy and thy greediness betray in thee  the nature of the dog and of the wolf? And with regard to thy uncleanness  and gluttony, are not these evidences of a swinish nature? Didst thou,  indeed, but rightly examine thine own breast, thou wouldst there discover  a world of unclean and noxious beasts. Even in the tongue, that \"little  member,\" there may be found, according to St. James, a lake of  pestilential and creeping things, a hold of every foul spirit, the cage of  every filthy and hateful bird (Isaiah 13:21; Rev. 18:2), and, in a word, a  \"world of iniquity.\" James 3:6. Often, alas! do we make such progress in  wickedness as to surpass in wrath and fury the beasts of prey; in  ravenousness and violence, the wolf; in subtilty and cunning, the fox; in  malice and virulence, the serpent; and in filthiness and obscenity, the  swine. Hence it was, that our Lord termed Herod a fox, and the unholy, in  general, dogs and swine; to whom that which is holy should not be given.  Luke 13:32; Matt. 7:6.    10. Whosoever, therefore, fails to correct this corruption of nature, by  being truly converted and _renewed_ in Christ Jesus, but dies in the state  which has been described, must retain, forever, this bestial and Satanical  nature. He must be arrogant, haughty, proud, and devilish, throughout  eternity. And when he shall have neglected the time of his purification  here, he shall bear about with him the image of Satan in the blackness of  darkness forever; as a testimony, that while he was in the world, he did  not live in Christ, nor was renewed after the image of God. \"For without  are dogs and sorcerers, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.\" Rev. 21:8;  22:15.          Chapter III.               Showing How Man Is Renewed In Christ Unto Eternal Life.          _In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor      uncircumcision, but a new creature._--GAL. 6:15.      The _New Birth_ is a work of the Holy Ghost, by which man, of a sinner, is  made righteous; and from being a child of damnation and wrath, is made a  child of grace and salvation. This change is effected through faith, the  word of God and the Sacraments; and by it, the heart, and all the powers  and faculties of the soul (more particularly the understanding, will, and  affections), are renewed, enlightened, and sanctified in Christ Jesus, and  are fashioned after his express likeness. The new birth comprehends two  chief blessings, namely, justification, and sanctification, or the renewal  of man. Tit. 3:5.    2. The birth of every real Christian is twofold. The first is \"after the  flesh,\" the second, \"after the spirit;\" the first is from beneath, the  second from above; the first is earthly, but the second heavenly. The one  is carnal, sinful, and accursed, as descending from the first Adam by the  seed of the serpent, after the similitude and image of the Devil; and by  this, the earthly and carnal nature is propagated. The other, on the  contrary, is spiritual, holy, and blessed, as derived from the second  Adam; after the likeness of the Son of God: and by this is propagated the  heavenly and spiritual man, the seed and image of God.    3. There is therefore in the Christian a _twofold_ line of descent; and,  consequently, _two_ men, as it were, exist in one and the same person. The  fleshly lineage is derived from Adam, and the spiritual lineage from  Christ, through faith: for as the old birth of Adam is in man by nature,  even so must the new birth of Christ be in him by grace. This is the old  and new man, the old and new birth, the old and new Adam, the earthly and  heavenly image, the flesh and the Spirit, Adam and Christ in us, and also,  the outward and inward man.    4. Let us now proceed to notice how we are regenerated by Christ. As the  old birth is propagated carnally from Adam, so the new birth is  spiritually propagated from Christ, through the word of God. This word is  the seed of the new creature: for we are \"born again, not of corruptible  seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth  forever.\" 1 Peter 1:23. And, again, \"Of his own will begat he us with the  word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.\"  James 1:18. The word of God produces faith; and faith again apprehends the  word of God, and in that word embraces Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost, by  whose spiritual efficacy and virtue man is regenerated or born anew. In  other words, regeneration is effected, in the first place, by the _Holy  Ghost_; and this is what Christ means by being \"born of the Spirit\" (John  3:5); secondly, by _faith_; whence it is said,--\"whosoever believeth that  Jesus is the Christ, is born of God\" (1 John 5:1); and thirdly, by holy  _Baptism_; according to that passage of Scripture, \"Except a man be born  of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\" John  3:5.    5. In Adam, man has inherited the chief evils; as sin, divine wrath,  death, Satan, hell, and damnation; but in Christ, he is restored to the  possession of the chief blessings, as righteousness, grace, blessing,  power, a heavenly life, and eternal salvation. From Adam, man inherits a  carnal spirit, and is subjected to the rule and tyranny of the evil  spirit; but from Christ, he obtains the Holy Spirit, with his gifts,  together with his comforting guidance. From Adam, man has derived an  arrogant, proud, and haughty spirit; but if he would be born again and  renewed in his mind, he must receive from Christ, by faith, an humble,  meek, and upright spirit. From Adam, man inherits an unbelieving,  blasphemous, and most ungrateful spirit; and it is his duty to obtain from  Christ a believing spirit, that will prove faithful, acceptable, and  well-pleasing to God. From Adam, a disobedient, violent and rash spirit is  inherited; but from Christ, we imbibe, through faith, the spirit of  obedience, gentleness, and modesty, and the spirit of meekness and  moderation. From Adam, we, by _nature_, inherit a spirit of wrath, enmity,  revenge, and murder; but from Christ, we, by faith, acquire the spirit of  long-suffering, love, mercy, forgiveness, and universal goodness and  benignity. From Adam, man, by nature, inherits a covetous heart, a  churlish, merciless spirit, that seeks only to profit self, and grasp at  that which is the right of another; but from Christ, is obtained, by  _faith_, the spirit of mercy, compassion, generosity, and mildness. From  Adam proceeds an unchaste, unclean, and intemperate spirit; but from  Christ, a spirit of chastity, purity, and temperance, may be obtained.  From Adam, there is communicated to man a spirit full of calumny and  falsehood; while on the other hand, he acquires from Christ the spirit of  truth, of constancy, and of integrity. Lastly, we receive from Adam a  brutish and earthly spirit; and from Christ, a spirit from above, which is  altogether heavenly and divine.    6. Hence, it behooved Christ to take upon himself our nature, and to be  conceived and anointed by the Holy Ghost, in order that we might all  receive of his fulness. It was requisite that \"the Spirit of the Lord  should rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit  of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord\"  (Isa. 11:2), that so human nature might in him, and by him, be restored  and renewed, and that we, in him, by him, and through him, might become  new creatures. This is accomplished by receiving from Christ, the spirit  of wisdom and understanding, for the spirit of folly; the spirit of  counsel, for that of madness; the spirit of might, for that of cowardice  and fear; the spirit of knowledge, instead of our natural blindness; and  the spirit of the fear of the Lord, instead of the spirit of impiety and  infidelity.    7. It is in this heavenly change that the new life and the new creation  within us consist. For as, in Adam we are all spiritually dead, and  incapable of performing any works, except those of death and darkness; so,  in Christ, we must be made alive (1 Cor. 15:22) and do the works of light  and life. As, by a _carnal generation_, we have inherited sin from Adam;  so, by _faith_, we must inherit righteousness from Christ. As, by a  fleshly descent from Adam, pride, covetousness, lust, and all kinds of  impurity, are entailed upon us; so by the spirit of Christ, our nature  ought to be renewed, and all pride, covetousness, lust, and envy, be  mortified within us.
