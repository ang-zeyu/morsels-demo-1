It has been long in use in variously modified forms by the most  successful wolf trappers, and its preparation is usually guarded as a  profound secret. It cannot be credited to any one trapper, since no  two prepare it in just the same way, but in most cases its  fundamental odors are the same. It may be prepared as follows:    \"Place half a pound of raw beef or venison in a wide-mouthed bottle  and let it stand in a warm place (but never in the sun) from two to  six weeks or longer or until it is thoroughly decayed and the odor  has become as offensive as possible. If the weather is not very warm  this may require several months. When decomposition has reached the  proper stage, add a quart of sperm oil or some liquid animal oil.  Lard oil may be used, but prairie dog oil is better. Add half an  ounce of assafoetida, dissolved in alcohol and one ounce of tincture  of Siberian musk, or, if this cannot be procured, one ounce of  pulverized beaver castor or one ounce of the common musk sold for  perfumery. Mix thoroughly and bottle securely until used.\"    The government has introduced this scent into Northern Michigan where  it has been used successfully. Other very similar decoys are used  extensively by Western trappers.    A scent which is highly recommended, and is used successfully by some  Wyoming wolf and coyote trappers is made by chopping fine, equal  portions of raw beef and fish and allowing same to decay in a covered  vessel. After it is thoroughly decomposed, add an ounce of  assafoetida dissolved in alcohol to each pound of the decoy. Animal  matter of any kind should never be allowed to decay in a tightly  closed vessel, as the gases may cause it to burst, but it must be  covered so as to exclude the flies. The above scent is claimed to be  very attractive to both wolves and coyotes and we know that the  trappers who used it made large catches, one of them having captured  over 200 coyotes in a single season. This trapper states that if the  perfume of the skunk is added to the decoy, its attractive properties  are greatly increased. This scent may be used in connection with  bait, or without, as preferred.    One of the northern trappers recommends a scent made by chopping  fine, equal parts of rabbit, skunk and muskrat flesh, with a couple  of wild mice added, and allow to decay in a jar. The jar should be  about 2/3 full and after it is decomposed a half ounce oil of anise  and a quantity of skunk scent is added, and the jar filled with goose  oil. This is the recipe as given but we can not guarantee it to be  attractive.    Many of the old time trappers claim to have scents which will draw a  wolf or coyote a half mile, or more, to the trap. Those who make such  statements should always be regarded with distrust for the chances  are that they only wish to sell the scent or the formula. In nine  cases out of ten it will be found that the scents are worthless. One  of our old time friends wrote as follows:    \"I have tried several so-called patent decoys with very indifferent  results. The only scent I care to use is the urine from a female wolf  or coyote killed in running season; sprinkle a drop or two on bush,  stone or ground near traps, but not on bait. After catching one  coyote at a setting I never trouble to bait again as the urine and  droppings will serve to attract other coyotes better than any bait.  Have caught 6 at one setting, 5 of them with no other bait than the  smell of the ground defiled by previous coyotes. They will come a  long way to scratch and urinate on same spot, and seem to lose some  of their caution.\"    Another successful trapper makes practically the same statements and  his views are appended.    \"After catching one wolf or coyote do not use more bait as the scent  is strong enough to draw all that comes near. I do not use any patent  decoy or scents, as I consider them useless for any game. The only  scent I use is what I make myself and then only from February to  April. In the summer I gather up four or five bitch dogs and as fast  as they come in heat I kill them and take the organs of generation  and pickle them in wide mouth bottles with alcohol enough to cover. I  sprinkle a few drops on a stone or bush, stick in center between  traps but use no other bait. This is also good for fox.    \"The above method is the same as I learned it from an old Hudson's  Bay trapper, Peirre Deverany, who was born in 1817, and had trapped  all thru the British possessions and the Rocky Mountains and with  whom I trapped for several years.\"    We find that many of the professional trappers condemn all scents  except those which they, themselves, use, but as there are a number  of successful ones using different scents it proves that there are  numbers of good decoys.    \"I use scent a good deal, but make it myself,\" writes one man who  follows trapping continually. \"The mating time is the best time to  use it and the matrix from a female wolf in alcohol is very good to  use. Put a few drops on a bone or stick of wood near the trap, say  ten or twenty inches from it. If you have two traps set near each  other, put the scent between them.\"    With regard to bait the grey wolf prefers horse flesh to beef. Colts  are also preferred to old horses. It is the same as regards cattle;  the calves and yearlings are invariably chosen. In the timbered  sections where there is very little stock for the wolves to prey on,  venison is perhaps the best bait. Antelope, jack rabbit, and in fact,  almost any kind of flesh is good if the wolf is hungry, but the bait  in all cases must be strictly fresh. Unless food is scarce, wolves  seldom return to the carcass of a victim, but they do so occasionally  and some are caught by setting traps in such places, especially in  the North, during winter when the animals are hungry. If possible  they prefer to kill their own game and it is that which makes the  trapping so difficult.    The same baits that are recommended for wolves are also good for  coyotes, but the coyote is not so particular regarding the condition  of its food and will eat tainted flesh, greedily. They are very fond  of mutton, prairie dogs, badgers and sage hens. As with the wolf,  horse flesh is a favorite food. One of the southwestern trappers  claims that they like fresh pork, in his section, better than any  other food.    It will be an easy matter in almost any part of the country to keep  the traps baited as the ranchmen and sheepmen are, as a rule, willing  to furnish animals for bait. As a general rule, we advise the use of  scent sets and blind sets in spring and summer and bait sets in fall  and winter.        CHAPTER XI.    SCENT METHODS.    In sections where the wolves and coyotes can obtain an abundance of  food, they do not care for meat bait and scent sets are recommended,  especially for grey wolves. Such sets are also successful in summer  when meat baits soon become tainted and lose all power of attraction.  There are many ways of using scent, depending much on the kind that  is used, and also on other things. One of the simplest as well as one  of the best is the following:    Having found the route of travel of a band of wolves, one may be  certain that he has found the proper place to set a number of traps,  for the wolves are sure to come around that way again. A pass through  the hills is an excellent place and as cattle, sheep and game animals  are almost certain to be traveling that way at certain seasons, one  is sure to find a trail of some sort traversing the pass. Having  located such a trail find a spot where same is well defined and  select a place for the trap, several feet to one side of the trail,  where it may be placed between bunches of brush, cactus, rocks or any  other obstruction that will guide the wolf over the trap. The  obstruction must be a natural one as the wolf is certain to detect  any artificial arrangement, and avoid it.    The trap should be fastened to a drag of some kind, which should be  buried and the trap must be set and covered as explained in another  chapter. In setting, the chain should be stretched out to its full  length so that the drag may be buried as far as possible from the  trap, and the disturbance of the soil is less likely to be noticed.  The scent should be applied to the grass, weeds or ground at the back  of the set, and so placed that in trying to reach it, the wolf or  coyote must walk over the trap. It should not be placed too near the  trap as the first impulse of the animal is to roll over the scent.    Mr. Vernon Bailey in his instructions for trapping describes this set  as follows:    \"The trap, chain and stone drag should be buried out of sight close  to a runway, where the wolves follow a trail or road, cross a narrow  pass, or visit a carcass, with the trap nearest the runway and flush  with the surface of the ground; to keep the earth from clogging under  the pan, the pan and jaws should be covered with an oval piece of  paper and over this should be sprinkled fine earth until the surface  is smooth and all traces of paper and trap are concealed.  The surface of the ground and the surroundings should appear as  nearly as possible undisturbed. The dust may be made to look natural  again, by sprinkling water on it. Touching the ground or other  objects with the hands, spitting near the trap or in any way leaving  a trace of human odors near by, should be avoided. Old, well-scented  gloves should be worn while setting traps, and a little of the scent  used for the traps should be rubbed on the shoe soles. A piece of old  cowhide may be used on which to stand and to place the loose earth in  burying drag and trap.    \"A narrow trail may be made by dragging the stone or scraping the  foot from across the runway to the trap. A slender line of scent  should be scattered along this "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34523"],[0,"Fishes of Chautauqua, Cowley and Elk Counties, Kansas (#13)"],[1,"es. Shiners  (_Notropis_ spp.) and _Lepomis megalotis_ were rarely taken. Hall  (1953:36) states that _Gambusia affinis_, _Fundulus notatus_, and  _Labidesthes sicculus_ are usually associated with overflow pools,  oxbows, and vegetated backwaters.    Those fishes mentioned in the preceding paragraph remained common in  the middle section of the stream. In addition _Notropis lutrensis_,  _Notropis umbratilis_, and _Lepomis megalotis_ were important members  of the fauna.    In the uppermost section shiners (_Notropis_ spp.) were common. In the  few upstream stations that were still in good condition with clear  flowing water, the fauna resembled that of the upstream stations on Big  Caney River. Most upstream stations on Grouse Creek were located on  highly intermittent streams that are treated below.          FAUNAS OF INTERMITTENT STREAMS      Because of severe, protracted drought, most of the streams studied had  ceased to flow by the close of the survey period. However, the duration  of intermittency varied greatly in different streams, as did its effect  in terms of the number and sizes of residual pools, water temperatures,  pollution, and turbidity. Crab Creek, Beaver Creek, and a small unnamed  tributary of Grouse Creek were severely affected by intermittency. Their  faunas are discussed below.    In Crab Creek six collections were made from points near the mouth to  the uppermost pool in which water was found. Pools near the mouth were  as large as thirty feet in width and ninety feet in length, while those  that were uppermost were shallow puddles averaging ten feet in length  and five feet in width. The uppermost station was situated in bluestem  pasture without benefit of shade from trees.    The species taken and their relative abundances based on five seine  hauls at each station are shown in Table 7. At the uppermost pool (G-17)  only small green sunfish were found. At G-16, next downstream, this  species was joined by large numbers of black bullheads and a few redfin  shiners and red shiners. G-13 was similar to G-16, but two additional  species occurred there. G-12 was a clear, deep pool much larger than any  at the stations upstream. Here, seven species were added to the fauna,  and the percentages of _Ictalurus melas_ and _Lepomis cyanellus_ were  much less. At G-10 _Fundulus notatus_, _Labidesthes sicculus_, and  _Minytrema melanops_ appeared. Nevertheless, fewer species (10) were  captured here than at station G-12 upstream.

Nine pools were  sampled (Table 8) of which number nine was the uppermost point where  water was found (except for farm ponds). Mainly young of _Lepomis  cyanellus_ and _Ictalurus melas_ were found in the uppermost stations,  as on Crab Creek. Only adults of _Notropis lutrensis_ and _Notropis  umbratilis_ were taken.    In another small intermittent tributary of Grouse Creek two collections  (G-14 and G-15) were made. One was from several isolated pools near the  source of the creek and the other was 1-1/2 miles upstream from the  mouth. The two stations were approximately four miles apart. Table 9  indicates approximate percentages of fish taken in five seine hauls at  these stations.

One of these  stations consisted of several small spring-fed pools in a dry arroyo  tributary to Little Beaver Creek. Around these small \"oases\" rushes and  smartweeds grew and blackbirds were nesting in the rushes. Although  green sunfish up to eight inches in length were common in the shallow  pools, no other species was found. The second station (C-17) on the East  Fork Big Caney River is of special interest. The pool was isolated, had  dimensions of about 25x25 feet, and had an average depth of 15 inches.  The water was foul; cows had been fed fodder in a sheltered area above  the pool during the preceding winter and the entire bottom was covered  to a depth of 6 inches to 1 foot with a detritus of decomposing fodder,  cattle feces, and leaves. The water became almost inky in consistency  when the bottom was stirred and its odor was offensive. A thick  gray-green bloom lay on the surface. This bloom was full of bubbles  indicating gases rising from the bottom muds. One hundred fifty-three  green sunfish, all less than 5 inches in length, were taken in one  seine-haul at this station.          EAST-WEST DISTRIBUTION      In the Arkansas River system in Kansas there are marked differences  between fish faunas of the western and eastern parts of the state. This  can be illustrated by comparison of Spring River in Cherokee County with  the Cimarron River in southwestern Kansas. Single collections from  Spring River or its tributaries usually contain 25 or more species of  fish. Collections from the Cimarron rarely contain more than five or six  species. Many of those fishes found in Spring River are characteristic  of an Ozarkian fauna, and some are endemic to the Ozark uplands. Fish  found in the Cimarron or Arkansas in western Kansas are members of a  plains fauna of wide distribution. There is mingling of these two faunal  groups across the state, with the number of Ozarkian species diminishing  westward, and certain plains species diminishing eastward. A number of  species such as _Moxostoma duquesnii_ and _Notropis spilopterus_ are  limited, on the basis of present records, to Spring River and its  tributaries in Kansas. Others have not been taken west of the Neosho  drainage. The Verdigris River provides the next major avenue of westward  dispersal followed by Caney River, Grouse Creek, and the Walnut River.  West of the Walnut River system Ozarkian species have been almost always  absent from collections. The Chikaskia River is somewhat exceptional.  Moore and Buck (1953) reported from this river several species that seem  more typical of eastern faunal associations. Table 10 indicates the  stream system in which the present westernmost records are located for a  number of fishes found in the Arkansas River system in Kansas."]]]
