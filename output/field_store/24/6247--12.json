Deer seen--Hope sails again--Eagle Bay--Gabriel Channel--'Williwaws'--    Port Waterfall--Natives--Admiralty Sound--Gabriel Channel--Magdalen    Channel--Hope returns to Port Famine--San Antonio--Lomas Bay--Loss of    boat--Master and two seamen drowned.    From Mr. Graves's report of the appearance of the channel to the S.E. of  Dawson Island, I decided to proceed there as soon as the Hope was ready,  for she required some alteration, and repairs.    A deer having been seen on Point St. Anna, Mr. Tarn landed, very early in  the morning, eager for the prize, but could only get an ineffectual shot.  At another time a few deer were seen by our party, near the river; but  instead of returning with the information, they fired their guns, loaded  with small shot only, which served but to scare them away. As the animal  was new to us, and we had evidence of its being equally new to Science, I  was anxious to procure a specimen, but never afterwards had an opportunity.  Here Sarmiento saw the only deer which he mentions in his journal.    The morning of the 16th seeming more favourable, I set out in the Hope. The  heights were covered with snow which had fallen the preceding night, the  thermometer had been at freezing point, and much ice had formed; but the  appearance of the weather deceived us: we had scarcely left the ship, when  it began to rain, and by the time we reached Cape San Isidro the wind had  freshened to a gale, which obliged me to anchor in Eagle Bay.    Having landed, a tent was pitched, and a blazing fire made to dry our  clothes. In the evening the gale blew with great {49} violence from S.W.,  and the Hope, at her anchor, sheered about by the squalls, was occasionally  laid over so as to dip her gunwale under water.    The following day (17th), although the rain had ceased, the wind was still  strong. Towards evening it fell, and early on the 18th we left Eagle Bay  with a fresh breeze from E.N.E., and passed close to Port San Antonio; but  were then delayed by calms and squalls. At noon a westerly wind sprung up,  and we proceeded down the Gabriel Channel, with the wind aft, and the tide  in our favour. Port Waterfall sheltered us for the night.    The apparently artificial formation of this channel is very striking. It  seems to have been formerly a valley between two ridges of the range, in  the direction of the strata (of which there are frequent instances, such as  the valley in the Lomas Range, opposite Cape San Isidro, the valley of  Valdez Bay, and one immediately to the north of the channel itself, besides  many others), and that at some remote period the sea had forced its way  through, effecting a communication between the Strait and the waters behind  Dawson Island: as if one of those great 'northern waves,' of which we once  heard so much, had rolled down the wide reach of the Strait (the  parallelism of whose shores is also remarkable) from the north-west,  towards Cape Froward; and finding itself opposed by the Lomas Range, had  forced a passage through the valley until stopped by the mountains at  Fitton Bay. Having imagined such a wave in motion, the reader may fancy it  uniting with another northern roller from Cape San Valentyn, attacking the  hills and carrying all before it, until Mount Hope, at the bottom of  Admiralty Sound, arrested its course. I have already noticed the remarkably  straight direction in which this curious channel trends. At both  extremities the width may be from two to three miles; but the shores  gradually approach each other midway, and the coast on each side rises  abruptly to the height of fifteen hundred feet. The south shore, sheltered  from the prevailing and strongest winds, is thickly covered with trees and  luxuriant underwood, which, being chiefly evergreen, improve {50} the  scenery greatly, particularly in the winter season: the north shore is also  well wooded for about two-thirds up; but the summit is barren and the  outline very much serrated, as is usual in slate formations.    On the north shore we noticed some extraordinary effects of the whirlwinds  which so frequently occur in Tierra del Fuego. The crews of sealing vessels  call them 'williwaws,' or 'hurricane-squalls,' and they are most violent.  The south-west gales, which blow upon the coast with extreme fury, are pent  up and impeded in passing over the high lands; when, increasing in power,  they rush violently over the edges of precipices, expand, as it were, and  descending perpendicularly, destroy every thing moveable. The surface of  the water, when struck by these gusts, is so agitated, as to be covered  with foam, which is taken up by them, and flies before their fury until  dispersed in vapour. Ships at anchor under high land are sometimes suddenly  thrown over on their beam-ends, and the next moment recover their  equilibrium, as if nothing had occurred. Again a squall strikes them,  perhaps on the other side, and over they heel before its rage: the cable  becomes strained, and checks the ship with a jerk, that causes her to start  a-head through the water, until again stopped by the cable, or driven  astern by another gust of wind.    At all these anchorages, under high land, there are some parts more exposed  than others; and by watching for those places which are least troubled by  these squalls, a more secure, or rather a more quiet, spot may be selected.  I do not consider ships so anchored to be in danger if their ground tackle  be good; but every thing that offers a stiff resistance must suffer from  the fury of these blasts. In many parts of this country trees are torn up  by the roots, or rent asunder by the wind; and in the Gabriel Channel the  'williwaws' bursting over the mountainous ridge, which forms the south side  of the channel, descend, and striking against the base of the opposite  shore, rush up the steep, and carry all before them. I know of nothing to  which I can better compare the bared track left by one of these squalls  than to a bad broad road. After {51} having made such an opening, the wind  frequently sweeping through prevents the growth of vegetation. Confused  masses of up-rooted trees lie at the lower ends of these bared tracks, and  show plainly what power has been exerted.    The southern shore of the channel is formed by the base of that range of  hills, which extends, from the eastern side of the Magdalen Channel,  towards the E.S.E. It is the highest part of Tierra del Fuego, and on it  are several remarkable mountains, besides Sarmiento, towering over all.    Close to the east end of the Gabriel Channel is Mount Buckland, a tall  obelisk-like hill, terminating in a sharp needle-point, and lifting its  head above a chaotic mass of 'reliquiae diluvianae,' covered with perpetual  snow, by the melting of which an enormous glacier on the leeward, or  north-eastern side, has been gradually formed. This icy domain is twelve or  fourteen miles long, and extends from near the end of the channel to Port  Waterfall, feeding, in the intermediate space, many magnificent cascades,  which, for number and height, are not perhaps to be exceeded in an equal  space of any part of the world. Within an extent of nine or ten miles,  there are upwards of a hundred and fifty waterfalls, dashing into the  channel from a height of fifteen hundred, or two thousand feet. The course  of many is concealed, at first, by intervening trees, and, when half-way  down the descent, they burst upon the view, leaping, as it were, out of the  wood. Some unite as they fall, and together are precipitated into the sea,  in a cloud of foam; so varied, indeed, are the forms of these cascades, and  so great their contrast with the dark foliage of the trees, which thickly  cover the sides of the mountain, that it is impossible adequately to  describe the scene. I have met with nothing exceeding the picturesque  grandeur of this part of the Strait.    There are several coves on the south shore, but opposite to them there is  no shelter until you reach a deep bay in which are several islets; and  where, I think, there is a communication with Brenton Sound, but we did not  enter it.    Port Waterfall may easily be known by a large flat-topped bare rock, lying  across the summit of the eastern head, and {52} by a magnificent cascade  formed by the union of two torrents.    All the plants of the Strait grow here: a sweet-scented Callixene (_C.  marginata_, Lam^k.) filled the air with its odour; and a beautiful flower  we had not previously seen, was found by Mr. Graves: it was pendulous,  tubular, about two inches long (Class. Hexand. Monog. Cal. 2 Pet. 3.  pointed), and of a rich carnation colour.    The trees are small and stunted; they are of the usual species, Beech and  Winter's-bark. Here we first noticed a large fern,[48] having a stem two or  three feet long, and five or six inches in diameter, very similar to the  Zamia of New Holland. We saw very few birds, and no quadrupeds. Among the  former was a king-fisher, which at the time was new to us; but it is  distributed over a large tract of South America, and I have since seen a  specimen said to have been shot at Rio de Janeiro.    Fitton Harbour is a deep inlet, surrounded on all sides by precipitous  land, rising to the height of three, or four thousand feet, and terminated  by peaks, of most fantastic shape, covered with ice and snow.    Between Fitton Harbour and Cape Rowlett are high mountains, two of which,  more conspicuous than the rest, we called 'Mount Sherrard,' and 'Curious  Peak.'    Card Point proved to be clay-slate, and I think the projection of Cape  Rowlett, and the mountains, are also of this rock.    While crossing over towards Cape Rowlett, (the south head of a deep sound,  trending to the S.E., which it was my intention to examine), we were met by  three canoes, containing, together, about twenty-four"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38967"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 4 (of 6) (#13)"],[1,"and extreme parsimony. We trust that the Signor Dottor  Antonioli will inform us more distinctly respecting the amount of Antonio's  property, though we are inclined to believe it could not have exceeded the  limits of mediocrity. The highest salaries received by him have been  ascertained. For the cupola and larger nave of the church of San Giovanni,  he was paid four hundred and seventy-two gold ducats, or Venetian zecchins,  and for the cupola of the cathedral, three hundred and fifty; doubtless  considerable sums, though we should consider he was occupied from the year  1520 until 1530, in the designs and labours requisite for works of such  magnitude, and which prevented him from accepting other offers of any  account during the interval. He earned forty gold ducats by his celebrated  picture of Night; his San Girolamo brought him forty-seven ducats, or  zecchins, besides his subsistence during six months he was employed on it;  and thus, in equal proportion, we may suppose him to have been recompensed  for the time bestowed upon his lesser pieces. The two which he painted for  the Duke of Mantua we may reckon at something more; but these were the only  ones he produced at the request of sovereigns. Thus much being certain, it  is hardly credible, that after deducting the expense of colours, of models,  and of assistants, including the maintenance of his family, there should  still have remained enough to leave that family in a state of affluence.      Footnote 12: In the opening of the Life we find--\"He was of a       very timid disposition, and with extreme inconvenience       devoted himself to incessant labour in order to provide for       a numerous family.\" Towards the conclusion he adds--\"Like       those who have a numerous family, Antonio was desirous,\" (he       had four sons,) \"of hoarding his money, and thus soon became       one of the most miserable of men.\" Elsewhere it is       observed--\"He held himself in slight esteem, and was       satisfied with little.\"      Footnote 13: \"It almost drives me mad with grief to think of       the wretchedness of poor Antonio; to think that so great a       man, if he were not an angel in human shape, should be thus       lost in a country which could not appreciate him, and though       with a reputation reaching to the skies, destined to die in       such a place so unhappily.\" In a letter to Lodovico, written       from Parma, 1580, (Malvas. vol. i. p. 366). Annibal likewise       exaggerated, because the Padri Benedettini, as well as       others, were aware of the value of Antonio.    But although we admit the reality of his supposed indigence, it can form no  reproach, no drawback upon the excellences of so great a man, crowning him  rather with additional honour, in particular when we reflect, that with  such limited means he was invariably lavish of his colours, to a degree  beyond example. There is not a single specimen, whether executed on copper,  on panels, or on canvass, always sufficiently choice, that does not display  a profusion of materials, of ultramarine, the finest lake and green, with a  strong body, and repeated retouches; yet for the most part laid on without  ever removing his hand from the easel before the work was completed. In  short he spared neither time nor expense, contrary to the custom of all  other painters, with very few exceptions. Such liberality, calculated to do  honour to a rich amateur, painting for amusement, is infinitely more  commendable in an artist of such circumscribed resources. It displays, in  my opinion, all the grandeur of character that was supposed to animate the  breast of a Spartan. And this we would advance, no less in reply to Vasari,  who cast undue reflections upon Coreggio's economy, than as an example for  such young artists as may be desirous of nourishing sentiments worthy of  the noble profession they embrace.    It is still current in Coreggio that Antonio commenced his first studies  under his uncle Lorenzo. Subsequent to which, according to Vedriani, he  entered into the school of Francesco Bianchi, called Il Frari, who died in  1510, a school established in Modena. There also it appears he acquired the  art of modelling, at that time in great repute; and he thus prepared in  clay, along with Begarelli, the group of that Pieta, in Santa Margherita,  where the three most beautiful figures are attributed to Coreggio. In the  same highly distinguished city it is most probable that he also laid the  foundation of that learned and cultivated taste so conspicuous in his  works; the geometrical skill exhibited in his perspective, the  architectural rules of his buildings, and the poetry of his warm and lively  conceptions. Thus his historians, judging from the specimens of his early  style, assert that he must have sought it in the academy of Andrea Mantegna  at Mantua; but the recently discovered fact of Andrea's having died in  1506, does away with such a supposition. It is, nevertheless, extremely  probable that he acquired it by studying the works left by Andrea at  Mantua, for which I can adduce various arguments. I have described pretty  fully the character of Mantegna's picture of Victory, the most  extraordinary of all he produced; imitations of this are to be met with in  many of the works of Coreggio, but most evidently so in the picture of his  St. George at Dresden. The manner in which Coreggio could have imbibed so  exquisite a taste, was always considered surprising and unaccountable,  prevailing every where, as we find it in his canvass, in his laying on his  colours, in the last touches of his pictures; but let us for a moment  suppose him a student of Andrea's models, surpassing all others in the same  taste as we before observed, and the wonder will be accounted for. Let us  moreover consider the grace and vivacity so predominant in the compositions  of Coreggio; that rainbow as it were of colours, that accurate care in his  foreshortenings, and of those upon ceilings; his abundance of laughing boys  and cherubs, of flowers, fruits, and all delightful objects; and let us  then ask ourselves whether his new style does not appear an exquisite  completion of that of Mantegna, as the pictures of Raffaello and Titian  display the progress and perfection of those of Perugino and Giovanni  Bellini.    In regard to his education in the studio of Mantegna, the generally  received opinion in Lombardy is, that Vedriani must have been mistaken in a  name; and that in place of Andrea, he ought to have pronounced his son  Francesco, the master with whom it is maintained Coreggio resided, either  in quality of pupil or assistant. Mantegna's school, indeed, had risen into  great reputation, having given striking proof of its excellence even in  foreshortening from above; besides surpassing Melozio, as I elsewhere  observed, so as only to leave another step before reaching the modern  manner. This was reserved for the genius of Coreggio, in common with the  master spirits of every other school, who flourished during the same  period. In truth from his very first attempts, he appears to have aimed at  a softer and fuller style than Mantegna's; and several, among whom is the  Abate Bettinelli, have pointed out some such specimens in Mantua. Signor  Volta, member of the Royal Academy there, assured me that Coreggio is named  in the books of the Opera di S. Andrea, for which reason, several of the  figures on the outside of the church, and in particular a Madonna, better  preserved than the rest, a youthful essay, but from the hand of one freed  from the stiffness of the quattrocentisti, have been attributed to him.[14]  In Mantua likewise I saw a little picture in possession of the Abate  Bettinelli, about to be engraved, representing a Holy Family, in which, if  we except a degree of stiffness in the folds, the modern manner is  complete. A few other of Coreggio's Madonnas, to be referred to this  period, are to be seen in the ducal gallery at Modena, with other works  mentioned in various places. Among these is a picture of our Lord, taking  farewell of the Virgin mother, previous to his passion, a piece recognized  as a genuine Coreggio by the Abate Carlo Bianconi at Milan.[15] Doubtless  many of his other early productions were of an inferior description, and  are dispersed abroad, either unknown, or disputed, Vasari having recorded  of him that _he completed many pictures and works_.      Footnote 14: There is a document existing in the same archives,       where Francesco Mantegna binds himself to ornament the       outside of the church. It may thus be conjectured, that the       picture of the Ascension, placed over the gateway, is from       his hand, while the Madonna, evidently from another, is the       work of Coreggio. The master, in executing his commissions,       often employed his pupil or his assistant.      Footnote 15: This excellent judge of art, more particularly in       point of engravings, and also extremely skilful in portraits       drawn with the pen, departed this life at the beginning of       1802.    Wherefore is it then that in the published catalogues we meet with so very  scanty a list of his pictures, nearly all esteemed excellent? It is because  whatever does not appear superlatively beautiful has been doubted, denied,  and cast aside as unworthy of him, or attributed to some of his school.  Mengs himself, who investigated the relics of this great artist, and was  very cautious of admitting any disputed productions, declares that he had  only seen one specimen of his early style, that of his S. Antony, in the  gallery of Dresden. This, as well as a S. Francis and the Virgin, he  painted in 1512, in Carpi, when he was eighteen years of age.[16] From the  stiffness apparent in this last, and the contrasted softness of the others,  he was led to conjecture that Coreggio must have suddenly altered his  manner, and attempted to penetrate into the unknown"]]]
