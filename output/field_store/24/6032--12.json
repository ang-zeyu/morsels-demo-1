The second growth here is considered of little value in  comparison with the value of the land for agricultural purposes. In  many cases, however, the farm value of the land is not at present  sufficient to make it profitable to clear it, unless the timber cut  will at least pay for the operation. There is considerable land upon  which the second growth will become valuable timber within a few  years. Such land should not be cleared until it is possible to utilize  the timber.    =39. Tupelo Gum= (_Nyssa aquatica_) (Bay Poplar, Swamp Poplar, Cotton  Gum, Hazel Pine, Circassian Walnut, Pepperidge, Nyssa). The close  similarity which exists between red and tupelo gum, together with the  fact that tupelo is often cut along with red gum, and marketed with  the sapwood of the latter, makes it not out of place to give  consideration to this timber. The wood has a fine, uniform texture, is  moderately hard and strong, is stiff, not elastic, very tough and hard  to split, but easy to work with tools. Tupelo takes glue, paint, or  varnish well, and absorbs very little of the material. In this respect  it is equal to yellow poplar and superior to cottonwood. The wood is  not durable in contact with ground, and requires much care in  seasoning. The distinction between the heartwood and sapwood of this  species is marked. The former varies in color from a dull gray to a  dull brown; the latter is whitish or light yellow like that of poplar.  The wood is of medium weight, about thirty-two pounds per cubic foot  when dry, or nearly that of red gum and loblolly pine. After  seasoning it is difficult to distinguish the better grades of sapwood  from poplar. Owing to the prejudice against tupelo gum, it was until  recently marketed under such names as bay poplar, swamp poplar, nyssa,  cotton gum, circassian walnut, and hazel pine. Since it has become  evident that the properties of the wood fit it for many uses, the  demand for tupelo has largely increased, and it is now taking rank  with other standard woods under its rightful name. Heretofore the  quality and usefulness of this wood were greatly underestimated, and  the difficulty of handling it was magnified. Poor success in seasoning  and kiln-drying was laid to defects of the wood itself, when, as a  matter of fact, the failures were largely due to the absence of proper  methods in handling. The passing of this prejudice against tupelo is  due to a better understanding of the characteristics and uses of the  wood. Handled in the way in which its particular character demands,  tupelo is a wood of much value.                                Uses of Tupelo Gum    Tupelo gum is now used in slack cooperage, principally for heading. It  is used extensively for house flooring and inside finishing, such as  mouldings, door jambs, and casings. A great deal is now shipped to  European countries, where it is highly valued for different classes of  manufacture. Much of the wood is used in the manufacture of boxes,  since it works well upon rotary veneer machines. There is also an  increasing demand for tupelo for laths, wooden pumps, violin and organ  sounding boards, coffins, mantelwork, conduits and novelties. It is  also used in the furniture trade for backing, drawers, and panels.                                Range of Tupelo Gum    Tupelo occurs throughout the coastal region of the Atlantic States,  from southern Virginia to northern Florida, through the Gulf States to  the valley of the Nueces River in Texas, through Arkansas and southern  Missouri to western Kentucky and Tennessee, and to the valley of the  lower Wabash River. Tupelo is being extensively milled at present only  in the region adjacent to Mobile Ala., and in southern and central  Louisiana, where it occurs in large merchantable quantities, attaining  its best development in the former locality. The country in this  locality is very swampy (see Fig. 11), and within a radius of one  hundred miles tupelo gum is one of the principal timber trees. It  grows only in the swamps and wetter situations (see Fig. 11), often in  mixture with cypress, and in the rainy season it stands in from two to  twenty feet of water.    =40. Black Gum= (_Nyssa sylvatica_) (Sour Gum). Black gum is not cut to  much extent, owing to its less abundant supply and poorer quality, but  is used for repair work on wagons, for boxes, crates, wagon hubs,  rollers, bowls, woodenware, and for cattle yokes and other purposes  which require a strong, non-splitting wood. Heartwood is light brown  in color, often nearly white; sapwood hardly distinguishable, fine  grain, fibres interwoven. Wood is heavy, not hard, difficult to work,  strong, very tough, checks and warps considerably in drying, not  durable. It is distributed from Maine to southern Ontario, through  central Michigan to southeastern Missouri, southward to the valley of  the Brazos River in Texas, and eastward to the Kissimmee River and  Tampa Bay in Florida. It is found in the swamps and hardwood bottoms,  but is more abundant and of better size on the slightly higher ridges  and hummocks in these swamps, and on the mountain slopes in the  southern Alleghany region. Though its range is greater than that of  either red or tupelo gum, it nowhere forms an important part of the  forest.                                     HACKBERRY    =41. Hackberry= (_Celtis occidentalis_) (Sugar Berry, Nettle Tree). The  wood is handsome, heavy, hard, strong, quite tough, of moderately fine  texture, and greenish or yellowish color, shrinks moderately, works  well and stands well, and takes a good polish. Used to some extent in  cooperage, and in the manufacture of cheap furniture. Medium- to  large-sized tree, locally quite common, largest in the lower  Mississippi Valley. Occurs in nearly all parts of the eastern United  States.                                      HICKORY    The hickories of commerce are exclusively North American and some of  them are large and beautiful trees of 60 to 70 feet or more in height.  They are closely allied to the walnut, and the wood is very like  walnut in grain and color, though of a somewhat darker brown. It is  one of the finest of American hardwoods in point of strength; in  toughness it is superior to ash, rather coarse in texture, smooth and  of straight grain, very heavy and strong as well as elastic and  tenacious, but decays rapidly, especially the sapwood when exposed to  damp and moisture, and is very liable to attack from worms and boring  insects. The cross-section of hickory is peculiar, the annual rings  appear like fine lines instead of like the usual pores, and the  medullary rays, which are also very fine but distinct, in crossing  these form a peculiar web-like pattern which is one of the  characteristic differences between hickory and ash. Hickory is rarely  subjected to artificial treatment, but there is this curious fact in  connection with the wood, that, contrary to most other woods, creosote  is only with difficulty injected into the sap, although there is no  difficulty in getting it into the heartwood. It dries slowly, shrinks  and checks considerably in seasoning; is not durable in contact with  the soil or if exposed. Hickory excels as wagon and carriage stock,  for hoops in cooperage, and is extensively used in the manufacture of  implements and machinery, for tool handles, timber pins, harness work,  dowel pins, golf clubs, and fishing rods. The hickories are tall trees  with slender stems, never forming forests, occasionally small groves,  but usually occur scattered among other broad-leaved trees in suitable  localities. The following species all contribute more or less to the  hickory of the markets:    =42. Shagbark Hickory= (_Hicoria ovata_) (Shellbark Hickory, Scalybark  Hickory). A medium- to large-sized tree, quite common; the favorite  among the hickories. Heartwood light brown, sapwood ivory or  cream-colored. Wood close-grained, compact structure, annual rings  clearly marked. Very hard, heavy, strong, tough, and flexible, but not  durable in contact with the soil or when exposed. Used for  agricultural implements, wheel runners, tool handles, vehicle parts,  baskets, dowel pins, harness work, golf clubs, fishing rods, etc. Best  developed in the Ohio and Mississippi basins; from Lake Ontario to  Texas, Minnesota to Florida.    =43. Mockernut Hickory= (_Hicoria alba_) (Black Nut Hickory, Black  Hickory, Bull Nut Hickory, Big Bud Hickory, White Heart Hickory). A  medium- to large-sized tree. Wood in its quality and uses similar to  the preceding. Its range is the same as that of _Hicoria ovata_.  Common, especially in the South.    =44. Pignut Hickory= (_Hicoria glabra_) (Brown Hickory, Black Hickory,  Switchbud Hickory). A medium- to large-sized tree. Heavier and  stronger than any of the preceding. Heartwood light to dark brown,  sapwood nearly white. Abundant, all eastern United States.    =45. Bitternut Hickory= (_Hicoria minima_) (Swamp Hickory). A  medium-sized tree, favoring wet localities. Heartwood light brown,  sapwood lighter color. Wood in its quality and uses not so valuable as  _Hicoria ovata_, but is used for the same purposes. Abundant, all  eastern United States.    =46. Pecan= (_Hicoria pecan_) (Illinois Nut). A large tree, very common  in the fertile bottoms of the western streams. Indiana to Nebraska and  southward to Louisiana and Texas.                                       HOLLY    =47. Holly= (_Ilex opaca_). Small to medium-sized tree. Wood of medium  weight, hard, strong, tough, of exceedingly fine grain, closer in  texture than most woods, of white color, sometimes almost as white as  ivory; requires great care in its treatment to preserve the whiteness  of the wood. It does not readily absorb foreign matter. Much used by  turners and for all parts of musical instruments, for handles on whips  and fancy articles, draught-boards, engraving blocks, cabinet work,  etc. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26600"],[0,"Mother Earth, Vol. 1 No. 1, March 1906 (#13)"],[1,"field.

These letters do not belong among those of great men which prove to be  disappointments. In reading them one is not inclined to ask as of  Schopenhauer's letters, why a philosophic genius of such depth should be  laden with thousands of philistine trivialities.    Ibsen reaches far beyond his surroundings in his letters. What he writes  is a continual protest against shallowness and mediocrity. The misery of  petty state affairs, of patriotism with a board on the forehead bothered  him greatly. This is shown on every page. Whatever he expresses, he  always aims at expanding the horizon; as he himself once remarked: the  revolutionizing of brains. His sentiments are European, and he must  often hear that even the wish for combining the Scandinavian countries  borders on treason. Thus he becomes a \"solitary soul.\" He has even  nothing in common with the radicals; he not only hates the state, the  enemy of individuality, but he is averse to all attempts which aim at  the drilling of the masses. He loves Bjoernson as a poet, but he wants to  have nothing to do with him as a politician. In a letter to Brandes he  writes:    \"Bjoernson says: 'The majority is always right.' And as a practical  politician he is bound, I suppose, to say so. I, on the contrary, must  of necessity say: 'The minority is always right.' Naturally, I am not  thinking of that minority of stagnationists who are left behind by the  great middle party, but I mean that minority which leads the van, and  urges on to points which the majority has not yet reached. I mean that  man is right who has allied himself most closely with the future.\"           *       *       *       *       *    +\"Under the Wheel\"+ is the title of a German story by Hermann Hesse, in  which he severely criticizes the incompetency of the present school  system to fully develop the youth. The characterization of the teachers'  profession as Hesse puts it, does not only serve for Germany, but for  all modern states in which governments strive to train the young for the  purpose of making patient subjects and hurrah-screaming patriots of  them. The author says with fine irony of the teacher: \"It is his duty  and vocation, entrusted to him by the state, to hinder and exterminate  the rough forces and passions of nature in the young people and to put  in place of them quiet moderation and ideals recognized by the state.  Many a one who at present is a contented citizen or an ambitious  official, would have become without these endeavors of the school an  unmanageable innovator or a hopeless dreamer. There was something in  him, something wild, lawless, which first had to be broken, a flame  which had to be extinguished. The school must break and forcibly  restrict the natural being; it is its duty to make a useful member of  society out of him, according to principles approved by the state's  authority. The wonderful work is crowned with the careful training in  the barracks.\"           *       *       *       *       *    We regret that several of the contributions, while having merits, were  not of the form to be used for a magazine.           *       *       *       *       *    Benj.
