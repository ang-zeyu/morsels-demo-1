However, an end came to the steps at length, and then, after  walking some distance in the open road, and being allowed to run  loose for a few minutes in a quiet street, full of strange, strong  smells and a curious absence of air, Finn and Kathleen were led  into a large building, bigger than the orchard at home, and  containing, besides countless humans, all the dogs that ever were  in all the world, all talking incoherently, and together. At least,  that was how it struck Finn and Kathleen. As a matter of fact,  there were some thousands of dogs in the Crystal Palace that day,  for it was the opening day of the great annual Kennel Club Show;  the biggest society event of the year among dogs. It was a more  exclusive assembly than any of the purely human sort, because every  dog, among all the thousands there assembled, was an aristocrat  with a pedigree as long as his body. There was not a parvenu among  them all; and there are no human assemblies about which that may be  said.    It is difficult to conceive precisely how great an ordeal it was  for Finn and Kathleen to face, when they were led down the length  of this great building to their own particular bench among the  other Irish Wolfhounds, of whom there were some thirty or forty  present. For fifty yards or more they walked down an aisle between  double rows of benches, every yard of which was occupied by  terriers of one sort and another, all yapping and barking at the  top of their respective registers. Be it remembered that Finn and  Kathleen, up till that morning, had never been at close quarters  with more than one dog at a time, and had never seen more than  about a dozen dogs outside their own breed altogether. The noise of  barking, the pungency and variety of smells, and the crowded  multiplicity of doggy personalities were at first overpowering, and  Finn and his sister walked with lowered tails, quick-shifting eyes,  raised hackles, and twitching skin. But pride of race, and the  self-confidence which goes with exceptional strength, soon came to  Finn's aid, and by the time he reached his own bench, his tail was  carried high and muzzle also, though he walked with unusual  rigidity, and at heart was far from comfortable.    Though the benches were continuous, the space allotted to each dog  was divided from that of the next dog by a strong galvanized iron  net-work, and each dog's chain was fastened to the back of his  bench. When the Wolfhounds were benched, Finn had his sister upon  his right, and (though he never suspected it) his redoubtable sire,  the great Champion Dermot Asthore, on his left. On Kathleen's right  was a big rebel of a dog with an angry eye, named Wolf Tone. Facing  them, on the other side of their aisle, was a long row of their  cousins, the Deerhound family; while behind them, and out of sight,  was an even longer row of their cousins on the other side: the  Great Dane family. Farther on, beyond Champion Dermot Asthore, who  sat in the rear of his bench wrapped in a cloak of kingly  isolation--he disliked shows very much, and now, late in his great  career, was thoroughly weary of them--was a row of five and twenty  distant connections of Finn's, belonging to the Russian Wolfhound  or Borzois family. Finn had noticed these white and lemon coloured  curled darlings as he was led along to his own bench, and his  nostrils had wrinkled with scorn as he noted their \"prettiness,\"  the snipey sharpness of their long muzzles, the extraordinary  slimness and delicacy of their legs, the effeminate narrowness of  their chests, and the toyish blue ribbons that decorated some of  their collars. Mentally, he granted these fashionable darlings  fleetness, but absolutely withheld from them the killing powers  they are credited with. \"Bah!\" one may imagine Finn muttering to  himself. \"Foxy tails, weasel's faces, terrier's legs--you are  almost toys!\"    Heavy-coated, massive old Dermot Asthore took no more notice of  Finn than of the rest of the show. He was supremely bored, and,  being perfectly aware that the show lasted three days, his  immediate prospect disgusted him. One fancied that on the few  occasions upon which he did open his mouth at all, his remark was  always the same--\"Tcha! And at my time of life, too!\" But Finn was  not otherwise neglected. The Mistress of the Kennels had a little  camp-stool, and on this she sat mid-way between Finn and Kathleen.  Finn also had the Master's hand-bag in his section of the bench;  and that was rather nice and companionable. Also, the Master  himself seemed seldom to be far away. He flitted to and fro,  generally in conversation with somebody, and always followed, for  so long as he was in sight, by the eyes of Finn and Kathleen. In  his hand he carried a yellow book which told him the names of every  dog in all that vast assemblage of canine princes and lordlings,  with details, too, as to their exalted ancestry.    The Mistress of the Kennels was studying a similar book, and if  Finn, whose muzzle at this time was just above her shoulder, could  have read, he would have seen that she was busy with the Irish  Wolfhound section of the catalogue. This showed her that there were  three separate classes for Irish Wolfhound dogs, and three for  bitches of the same breed--Open, Limit, and Novice; with first,  second, and third prizes to be won in each class. The Open classes  were for all and any Irish Wolfhounds of each sex; the Limit  classes were for such as had not previously won more than six first  prizes; and the Novice classes were for hounds that had never won a  first prize in any show. There was also a junior class for hounds  of both sexes under the age of eighteen months. In the Open dog  class there appeared the names of no fewer than two fully-fledged  champions, and two other fully developed hounds that were already  within measurable reach of championship honours; besides several  other Wolfhounds of high repute and proved prowess as prize-winners  at shows. In the Open bitch class there was one champion entered,  and four or five others of whom great things had been predicted. In  the other classes it was evident that competition would be brisk.  In the Limit class, for example, were several hounds well past  maturity who had already won at other shows as many as four and  five first prizes. The Novice classes included the names of some  extremely promising hounds, several of whom had already won second  and third prizes elsewhere. In the junior class there were four  other entries, besides those of Finn and Kathleen. But Finn and  Kathleen had been boldly entered right through, in all classes for  which they were eligible. Old breeders who had not seen them smiled  over the breeder's enthusiasm in entering fifteen months old  youngsters in Open classes, where they would meet old champions,  whose very names carried great weight, both with the judges and the  public.    A young Irish Wolfhound, lying down among the straw of his bench,  is a very deceptive animal. When he is, say, three years old, his  beard and brows, massive shoulders, and set, assured expression  give one fair warning of the commanding presence he will display  when he rises. But when he is yet young he looks a much lesser  creature than he is when seen on a show bench, particularly if, as  so often happens, he makes a kind of nest for himself in the straw.  Most of the people specially interested in Wolfhounds paused  opposite Finn's place, and made some passing remark about: \"Fine  head, that!\" \"Good muzzle that youngster has!\" or if they noticed  one of his forelegs over the straw: \"Wonderful heavy timbers,  those!\" But they paid no very particular heed really to the hounds  from the cottage beside the Downs. Now and again, however, an old  breeder, passing leisurely along the benches, would pause when he  had passed Kathleen, and, after a quick glance back, return to  Finn's place, looking up his number in the catalogue, and gazing at  the young hound with a gravely calculating eye. \"Fifteen months  old!\" muttered one of these, glancing to and fro between his  catalogue and Finn. \"H'm! By old Dermot--Tara. Yes. Finn. Ah!\" And  so on down the benches. Finn had a notion that these men knew a  good deal; they had a knowledgeable way with them. Finn would have  obeyed them readily. That was how their manner impressed him.    By the time Finn had to some extent exhausted the first novelty of  his surroundings, and was contemplating the desirability of  sleeping off some of its effects--the number of new impressions he  had formed that morning was at least equal to those of a human's  first visit to a great picture gallery--the Master came along with  something of a rush, chains were unsnapped, and Finn and his sister  were taken down from the bench. A number of other Wolfhounds were  leaving the bench at the same time, and being led in the direction  of a fenced-in judging ring (square in shape, by the way) at one  end of the building. The dog classes for Irish Wolfhounds were  about to be judged, and the Mistress of the Kennels brought  Kathleen along, though her sex was not to be judged for some time,  because she knew the youngster would be unhappy if left alone on  the bench. The Master was leading Finn, and, before they entered  the ring, he passed his hand solicitously over the dog's immature  brows and beard once or twice, even as a very young man may be  noticed to tug at his moustache with a view, presumably, to making  the very most of it. The Mistress found a place for herself beside  the ring with Kathleen, which not only gave her a good view of the  judging, but also showed her plainly to all in the ring. This was  for Finn's especial benefit. And then the Master walked into the  ring with Finn, and took up his place next to the lady"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30560"],[0,"Music: An Art and a Language (#13)"],[1,"case we reach the end of the  sentence in the 17th measure and careful counting, and consideration  of the melodic outline, will convince us that the 9th measure,  emphasized by the _sf_ mark, is repeated.    When an extra measure is systematically introduced into each phrase of  4 measures we have what is known as \"five-bar rhythm\"--so prevalent in  the works of Schubert and Brahms.    [Music: SCHUBERT: _Sonata in E[flat] major_]    [Music: BRAHMS: _Ballade in G minor_]    As everyone is familiar with the latter composition, only the melody  is cited. This propulsion of the mind forward beyond the accustomed  point of rest always produces a stimulating rhythmic effect.[61]    [Footnote 61: Other charming examples of five-bar rhythm may be found  in Schubert's Quartet in A minor, op. 29, and in the opening choral  (St. Anthony) of Brahms's _Orchestral Variations_, op. 56a.]    The normal phraseology of four and eight measures is altered at times  by the _omission_ of certain measures. This often takes place at the  beginning of the sentence, as may be seen from the structure of the  so-called Anglican chant, familiar to all Protestants, _e.g._    [Music: SAVAGE]    The beginning of Mozart's _Overture to Figaro_ is also well known,  _e.g._    [Music]    The elision of a measure often takes place in the middle of a phrase  as may be seen from the theme of Mendelssohn's familiar _Spring-Song_.    [Music]    Just as in the case of the systematic insertion of an extra measure,  which produces \"five-bar rhythm,\" so when a measure is omitted in each  phrase which would usually consist of four measures, we have  \"three-bar rhythm.\" This gives an effect of great concentration and  intensity and is a prevalent feature in Scottish and Hungarian  folk-music, _e.g._    [Music: Scotch]    [Music: Hungarian]    Additional examples of three-bar rhythm may be found in the Scherzo of  Beethoven's Tenth Sonata and in the Minuet of Mozart's _G minor  Symphony_--the latter, one of the most striking examples in  literature.    When a measure is systematically omitted from the normal structure of  the 8 measure sentence we have \"seven-bar rhythm\"; of which beautiful  examples may be found in the Scherzo of Beethoven's Sonata in B-flat  major, op. 106, and in Mozart's Quartet in F major, No. 23. As these  examples are readily accessible they are not quoted. The humorous  effect produced, in the Beethoven example, by the unexpected elision  of the 7th measure is very marked.    Flexibility in the structure of a sentence is often gained by what is  known as \"overlapping\"[62] of phrases, _i.e._, where the closing  measure of a sentence, the 8th or 12th for example, is identical with  the first measure of the following phrase. A clear example is this  passage from the first movement of Beethoven's Third Sonata, _e.g._    [Music]    [Footnote 62: This effect is clearly brought out in symphonic music  where one portion of the orchestra, with a certain tone color, may be  ending a phrase at the same moment at which another part, with a  contrasting tone color, begins. An excellent example is the first  theme of the Slow movement of Schumann's Second Symphony (measures  7-8).]    As the principles of sentence-formation are closely involved with the  general subject of rhythm, something must be known about the number of  beats within the measure itself. While it is true that we Anglo-Saxons  tend to think in terms of 2 and 3 or their multiples, _i.e._, our  customary measures consist of 2 or 4 beats or of 3, 6, 9 and 12, in  modern music--particularly that of other races (the Slavs, Hungarians,  etc.)--we often find measures with 5 and 7 beats and even phrases  containing a mixture of rhythms. Three excellent examples of  compositions with measures of 5 beats each are the Slow Movement of  Chopin's Sonata in C minor, op. 4, the F-sharp major portion of  d'Indy's Symphonic Variations, _Istar_, and the second movement of  Tchaikowsky Sixth Symphony, _e.g._    [Music]    A delightful example of a melody with 7 beats a measure is the Andante  Grazioso of Brahms's Trio in C minor, op. 101--the result undoubtedly  of his well-known fondness for Hungarian music, _e.g._    [Music]    The following theme from Tchaikowsky's Quartet in F major,  notwithstanding the time signature, certainly gives the effect of a  long, seven-beat measure, _e.g._    [Music]    Those who wish to do a little investigating of their own in the field  of modern music will find interesting examples of 5/4 and 7/4 metres  in Ravel's _Daphnis and Chloe_, in d'Indy's Sonata for Violin and  Pianoforte and in the Ballet music of Stravinsky.    We even find passages where, for special effect, the usual beats are  elided or extra beats inserted. Schumann was one of the most daring  experimenters in this respect and such fantastic effects are frequent  in his pianoforte works--notably in the _Carnaval_, op. 9, and in the  _Phantasiestuecke_, op. 12, _e.g._    [Music: SCHUMANN: _Carnaval_]    With reference to all the foregoing principles and comments the  music-lover is cautioned against the assumption that music, from the  standpoint of the composer or the listener, is merely a matter of  mechanical counting; or that the \"swing\" of music is as regular as  that of a sewing-machine. But, as order is Heaven's first law, it is  true that music tends to move in definite, symmetrical groups; and  where departure is made from this practise the effect is one most  carefully planned. The matter deserves earnest consideration, for, in  what is known as the \"rhythmical sense,\" Americans--as a people, in  comparison with foreign nations--are still woefully deficient. As  rhythm is the basic element in all music, there is nothing in which  the listener should more definitely train his faculties than in  intelligent cooperation with the freedom of the composer.          CHAPTER V    THE TWO-PART AND THREE-PART FORMS      Now that a clear insight has been gained into the formation of the  normal sentence, we are in a position to understand how sentences may  be combined to make complete compositions. The simplest and most  primitive structure is that which contains _two_ complete sentences;  dividing itself naturally into _two_ parts and hence known as the  Two-Part Form. This form by reason of its simplicity and directness is  often found in the short pianoforte pieces of Schumann, Tchaikowsky,  Brahms, Grieg and Debussy. For a long period there was no attempt at  differentiation between vocal and instrumental style; music, in fact,  during the 15th and 16th centuries was often entitled \"buon da cantare  ou suonare,\" _i.e._, equally well suited for voices or instruments.  When instrumental players were in search of pieces, they simply  transferred to their instruments the voice-parts of the Madrigals and  Canzonas which were then so fashionable.[63] With the development of  instruments--especially of the Violin family--and with the desire for  an instrumental style which should be independent of words, principles  of coherent design had to be evolved; and they were suggested by the  definite metre in the stanzas of the Folk-song and, above all, by the  symmetrical phrases of the Folk-dance, used to accompany the  _rhythmical_ motions of the body. By a utilization of these principles  of balanced phrases, of contrasted keys and of periodic themes,  instrumental music gradually worked out a structure of its own,[64]  of which we find examples in National dances and in the compositions  of such pioneers of instrumental style as the Italians Corelli and  Vivaldi, the Frenchmen Lully, Couperin and Rameau, and the Englishman  Purcell.    [Footnote 63: For a complete account of this process see Parry's  _Evolution of the Art of Music_, p. 115 _seq._]    [Footnote 64: This book makes no attempt to give an historical account  of the development of instrumental form. The subject is set forth  comprehensively in the article on Form in Grove's Dictionary (Vol. II,  p. 73) and in the Fifth and Sixth Chapters of Parry's _Evolution of  the Art of Music_.]    [Music:        Viens dans ce bocage belle Aminte,      Sans contrainte L'on y forme des voeux;      Viens, Viens dans ce bocage belle Aminte,      Il est fait pour les plaisirs et les jeux.]    In this rhythmic and sprightly dance of exactly 8 measures (an old  French _Tambourin_ taken from Weckerlin's _Echos du Temps Passe_) we  see clearly the influence of the metrical stanza of words and of the  balanced phrases in the instrumental part, necessary to accompany the  steps of the dancers. The melody of the accompaniment was played on a  flute or some simple kind of pipe, and the bass on a Tambour de  Basque--a rude form of drum, which repeated continually the tonic and  dominant of the key; the same effect which we associate with the  Bagpipe and Hurdy-gurdy.    [Music: PURCELL: Jig.]    In this Jig, which was a favorite type with the English  peasantry--divided into three sentences of exactly 8 measures  each--the dance rhythm is very sharply defined. From various  dance-patterns a structural type was gradually evolved, of which the  chief features will now be indicated. The music was divided into _two_  distinct halves and it became the convention to gain length by  repeating each half--in the early days of the form, _literally_ (with  a double bar and sign of repeat); later, as composers gained freedom,  with considerable amplification. Each half presented the _same_  material (it was a _one_-theme form) but the two halves were  contrasted in _tonality_, _i.e._, the first part, beginning in the  home-key, would modulate to some related key--generally the dominant;  the second part, starting out in this key, gradually modulated back to  a final cadence in the original key, and often--especially in Haydn  and Mozart--repeated the entire main sentence of the first part. The  general effect of such a form has been wittily described[65] as  resembling"]]]
