Using the method of expressing the heat of vaporization in electrical  units, Smith concludes that the heat of vaporization of water between  14 deg. and 40 deg. is given by the formula         L (in joules) = 2502.5 - 2.43T    and states that the \"probable error\" of values computed from this  formula is 0.5 joule. The results are expressed in international joules,  that is, in terms of the international ohm and 1.43400 for the E.M.F. of  the Clark cell at 15 deg. C., and assuming that the mean calorie is  equivalent to 4.1877 international joules,[12] the formula reads         L (in mean calories) = 597.44 - 0.580T    With this formula Smith calculates that at 15 deg. the heat of vaporization  of water is equal to 588.73 calories; at 20 deg., 585.84 calories; at 25  deg., 582.93 calories; at 30 deg., 580.04 calories;[13] and at 35 deg.,  577.12 calories. In all of the calculations in the researches herewith we  have used the value found by Smith as 586 calories at 20 deg. Inasmuch as  all of our records are in kilo-calories, we multiply the weight of water  by the factor 0.586 to obtain the heat of vaporization.      THE BED CALORIMETER.    The chair calorimeter was designed for experiments to last not more than  6 to 8 hours, as a person can not remain comfortably seated in a chair  much longer than this time. For longer experiments (experiments during  the night and particularly for bed-ridden patients) a type of  calorimeter which permits the introduction of a couch or bed has been  devised. This calorimeter has been built, tested, and used in a number  of experiments with men and women. The general shape of the chamber is  given in fig. 26. The principles involved in the construction of the  chair calorimeter are here applied, _i. e._, the use of a  structural-steel framework, inner air-tight copper lining, outer zinc  wall, hair-felt insulation, and outer asbestos panels. Inside of the  chamber there is a heat-absorbing system suspended from the ceiling, and  air thermometers and thermometers for the copper wall are installed at  several points. The food-aperture is of the same general type and the  furniture here consists simply of a sliding frame upon which is placed  an air-mattress. The opening is at the front end of the calorimeter and  is closed by two pieces of plate glass, each well sealed into place by  wax after the subject has been placed inside of the chamber. Tubes  through the wall opposite the food-aperture are used for the  introduction of electrical connections, ingoing and outgoing water, the  air-pipes, and connections for the stethoscope, pneumograph, and  telephone.    The apparatus rests on four heavy iron legs. Two pieces of channel iron  are attached to these legs and the structural framework of the  calorimeter chamber rests upon these irons. The method of separating the  asbestos outer panels is shown in the diagram. In order to provide light  for the chamber, the outer wall in front of the glass windows is made  of glass rather than asbestos. The front section of the outer casing can  be removed easily for the introduction of a patient.    In this chamber it is impossible to weigh the bed and clothing, and  hence this calorimeter can not be used for the accurate determination of  the moisture vaporized from the lungs and skin of the subject, since  here (as in almost every form of respiration chamber) it is absolutely  impossible to distinguish between the amount of water vaporized from  bed-clothing and that vaporized from the lungs and skin of the subject.  With the chair calorimeter, the weighing arrangements make it possible  to weigh the chair, clothing, etc., and thus apportion the total water  vaporized between losses from the chair, furniture, and body of the man.  In view of the fact that the water vaporized from the skin and lungs  could not be determined, the whole interior of the chamber of the bed  calorimeter has been coated with a white enamel paint, which gives it a  bright appearance and makes it much more attractive to new patients. An  incandescent light placed above the head at the front illuminates the  chamber very well, and as a matter of fact the food-aperture is so  placed that one can lie on the cot and actually look outdoors through  one of the laboratory windows.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--Cross-section of bed calorimeter, showing part  of steel construction, also copper and zinc walls, food-aperture, and  wall and air-resistance thermometers. Cross-section of opening,  cross-section of panels of insulating asbestos, and supports of  calorimeter itself are also indicated.]    Special precaution was taken with this calorimeter to make it as  comfortable and as attractive as possible to new and possibly  apprehensive patients. The painting of the walls unquestionably results  in a condensation of more or less moisture, for the paint certainly  absorbs more moisture than does the metallic surface of the copper. The  chief value of the determination of the water vaporized inside of the  chamber during an experiment lies, however, not in a study of the  vaporization of water as such, but in the fact that a certain amount of  heat is required to vaporize the water and obviously an accurate measure  of the heat production must involve a measure of the amount of water  vaporized. So far as the measurement of heat is concerned, it is  immaterial whether the water is vaporized from the lungs or skin of the  subject or the clothing, bedding, or walls of the chamber; since for  every gram of water vaporized inside of the chamber, from whatever  source, 0.586 calorie of heat must have been absorbed.    The apparatus as perfected is very sensitive. The sojourn in the chamber  is not uncomfortable; as a matter of fact, in an experiment made during  January, 1909, the subject remained inside of the chamber for 30 hours.  With male patients no difficulty is experienced in collecting the urine.  No provision is made for defecation, and hence it is our custom in long  experiments to empty the lower bowel with an enema and thus defer as  long as possible the necessity for defecation. With none of the  experiments thus far made have we experienced any difficulty in having  to remove the patient because of necessity to defecate in the cramped  quarters. It is highly probable that, with the majority of sick  patients, experiments will not extend for more than 8 or 10 hours, and  consequently the apparatus as designed should furnish most satisfactory  results.    In testing the apparatus by the electrical-check method, it has been  found to be extremely accurate. When the test has been made with burning  alcohol, as described beyond, it has been found that the large amount of  moisture apparently retained by the white enamel paint on the walls  vitiates the determination of water for several hours after the  experiment begins, and only after several hours of continuous  ventilating is the moisture content of the air brought down to a low  enough point to establish equilibrium between the moisture condensed on  the surface and the moisture in the air and thus have the measured  amount of moisture in the sulphuric acid vessels equal the amount of  moisture formed by the burning of alcohol. Hence in practically all of  the alcohol-check experiments, especially of short duration, with this  calorimeter, the values for water are invariably somewhat too high. A  comparison of the alcohol-check experiments made with the bed and chair  calorimeters gives an interesting light upon the power of paint to  absorb moisture and emphasizes again the necessity of avoiding the use  of material of a hygroscopic nature in the interior of an apparatus in  which accurate moisture determinations from the body are to be made.    The details of the bed calorimeter are better shown in fig. 4. The  opening at the front is here removed and the wooden track upon which the  frame, supporting the cot, slides is clearly shown. The tension  equalizer (see page 71) partly distended is shown connected to the  ingoing air-pipe, and on the top of the calorimeter connected to the  tension equalizer is a Sonden manometer. On the floor at the right is  seen the resistance coil used for electrical tests (see page 50). A  number of connections inside the chamber at the left are made with  electric wires or with rubber tubing. Of the five connections appearing  through the opening, reading from left to right, we have, first, the  rubber connection with the pneumograph, then the tubing for connection  with the stethoscope, then the electric-resistance thermometer, the  telephone, and finally a push button for bell call. The connections for  the pneumograph and stethoscope are made with the instruments outside on  the table at the left of the bed calorimeter.      MEASUREMENTS OF BODY-TEMPERATURE.    While it is possible to control arbitrarily the temperature of the  calorimeter by increasing or decreasing the amount of heat brought away,  and thus compensate exactly for the heat eliminated by the subject, the  hydrothermal equivalent of the system itself being about 20 calories--on  the other hand the body of the subject may undergo marked changes in  temperature and thus influence the measurement of the heat production to  a noticeable degree; for if heat is lost from the body by a fall of  body-temperature or stored as indicated by a rise in temperature,  obviously the heat produced during the given period will not equal that  eliminated and measured by the water-current and by the latent heat of  water vaporized. In order to make accurate measurements, therefore, of  the heat-production as distinguished from the heat elimination, we  should know with great accuracy the hydrothermal equivalent of the body  and changes in body temperature.
