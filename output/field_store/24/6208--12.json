Having rounded the cape, they entered a great gulf,  on the eastern side of which, where it is shallow and clear of rocks,  they saw a great village, with the houses built over the water, on piles  driven into the bottom, and the people communicated from one to the other  in canoes. Hojeda named it the Gulf of Venice, from its similarity to  that famous city in Italy. The Indians called it the Gulf of Coquibacoa,  and we know it now as the Gulf of Venezuela. They explored the interior,  and discovered, as it would seem, on the 24th of August, the lake and port  of San Bartolome,[106] now the lake of Maracaibo, where they obtained  some Indian women of notable beauty and disposition. It is certain that  the natives of this country had the fame of being more beautiful and  gracious than those of any other part of that continent. Having explored  the western part of the gulf, and doubled the Cape of Coquibacoa,  Hojeda and his companions examined the coast as far as the Cabo de la  Vela, the extreme point reached in this voyage. On the 30th of August  they turned on their homeward voyage for Espanola or Santo Domingo,  and entered the port of Yaquimo on the 5th of September 1499, with the  intention of loading with brasil wood, according to what Don Fernando  Columbus says.    Here Hojeda had those disputes with Roldan which are referred to by our  historians, but, finally, with leave from that chief, Hojeda removed  his ships to Surana, in February 1500.[107] According to Vespucci, in  his letter to Medici,[108] they navigated from Espanola in a northerly  direction for 200 leagues, discovering more than a thousand islands, most  of them inhabited, which would probably be the Lucayos, although those are  not nearly so numerous. On one of these he says that they violently seized  232 persons for slaves, and that from thence they returned to Spain by the  islands of the Azores, Canary and Madeira, arriving in the Bay of Cadiz  in the middle of June 1500, where they sold many of the 200 slaves that  arrived, the rest having died on the voyage. The truth of these events  is not very certain, but it is certain that the profit of the expedition  was very small. According to the same Vespucci, deducting costs, not more  than 500 ducats remained to divide among 55 shareholders, and this when,  besides the price of the slaves, they brought home a quantity of pearls,  worthy of a place in the royal treasury, of gold and some precious stones,  but not many, for, imitating badly the acts of the Admiral, the desire to  push on for discovery was greater than that for the acquisition of riches.           *       *       *       *       *          THIRD VOYAGE OF AMERIGO VESPUCCI.      Being afterwards in Seville, resting from so many labours that I had  endured during these two voyages, and intending to return to the land of  pearls, Fortune showed that she was not content with these my labours.  I know not how there came into the thoughts of the Most Serene King Don  Manuel of Portugal the wish to have my services. But being at Seville,  without any thought of going to Portugal, a messenger came to me with  a letter from the Royal Crown, in which I was asked to come to Lisbon,  to confer with his Highness, who promised to show me favour. I was not  inclined to go, and I despatched the messenger with a reply that I was  not well, but that when I had recovered, if his Highness still wished  for my services, I would come as soon as he might send for me. Seeing  that he could not have me, he arranged to send Giuliano di Bartolomeo  di Giocondo for me, he being in Lisbon, with instructions that, come  what might, he should bring me. The said Giuliano came to Seville,  and prayed so hard that I was forced to go. My departure was taken ill  by many who knew me, for I left Castille where honour was done me, and  where the King held me in good esteem. It was worse that I went without  bidding farewell to my host.    When I was presented to that King, he showed his satisfaction that I had  come, and asked me to go in company with three of his ships that were  ready to depart for the discovery of new lands. As the request of a  king is a command, I had to consent to whatever he asked, and we sailed  from this port of Lisbon with three ships on the 10th of March 1501,  shaping our course direct for the island of Grand Canary. We passed  without sighting it, and continued along the west coast of Africa. On  this coast we made our fishery of a sort of fish called _parchi_. We  remained three days, and then came to a port on the coast of Ethiopia  called _Besechiece_,[109] which is within the Torrid Zone, the North  Pole rising above it 14 deg. 30', situated in the first climate. Here we  remained two days, taking in wood and water; for my intention was to  shape a course towards the south, in the Atlantic Gulf. We departed from  this port of Ethiopia, and steered to the south-west, taking a quarter  point to the south[110] until, after sixty-seven days, we came in sight  of land, which was 700 leagues from the said port to the south-west.[111]  In those sixty-seven days we had the worst time that man ever endured who  navigated the seas, owing to the rains, perturbations, and storms that we  encountered. The season was very contrary to us, by reason of the course  of our navigation being continually in contact with the equinoctial line,  where, in the month of June, it is winter. We found that the day and  the night were equal, and that the shadow was always towards the south.    It pleased God to show us a new land on the 17th of August, and we  anchored at a distance of half a league, and got our boats out. We then  went to see the land, whether it was inhabited, and what it was like. We  found that it was inhabited by people who were worse than animals. But  your Magnificence must understand that we did not see them at first,  though we were convinced that the country was inhabited, by many signs  observed by us. We took possession for that Most Serene King; and found  the land to be very pleasant and fertile, and of good appearance. It was  5 deg. to the south of the equinoctial line. We went back to the ships, and  as we were in great want of wood and water, we determined, next day, to  return to the shore, with the object of obtaining what we wanted. Being  on shore, we saw some people at the top of a hill, who were looking  at us, but without showing any intention of coming down. They were  naked, and of the same colour and form as the others we had seen. We  tried to induce them to come and speak with us, but did not succeed,  as they would not trust us. Seeing their obstinacy, and it being late,  we returned on board, leaving many bells and mirrors on shore, and other  things in their sight. As soon as we were at some distance on the sea,  they came down from the hill, and showed themselves to be much astonished  at the things. On that day we were only able to obtain water.    Next morning we saw from the ship that the people on shore had made a  great smoke, and thinking it was a signal to us, we went on shore, where  we found that many people had come, but they still kept at a distance from  us. They made signs to us that we should come inland with them. Two of  our Christians were, therefore, sent to ask their captain for leave to go  with them a short distance inland, to see what kind of people they were,  and if they had any riches, spices, or drugs. The captain was contented,  so they got together many things for barter, and parted from us, with  instructions that they should not be more than five days absent, as we  would wait that time for them. So they set out on their road inland,  and we returned to the ships to wait for them. Nearly every day people  came to the beach, but they would not speak with us. On the seventh day  we went on shore, and found that they had arranged with their women; for,  as we jumped on shore, the men of the land sent many of their women to  speak with us. Seeing that they were not reassured, we arranged to send  to them one of our people, who was a very agile and valiant youth. To  give them more confidence, the rest of us went back into the boats. He  went among the women, and they all began to touch and feel him, wondering  at him exceedingly. Things being so, we saw a woman come from the hill,  carrying a great stick in her hand.[112] When she came to where our  Christian stood, she raised it, and gave him such a blow that he was  felled to the ground. The other women immediately took him by the feet,  and dragged him towards the hill. The men rushed down to the beach,  and shot at us with their bows and arrows. Our people, in great fear,  hauled the boats towards their anchors,[113] which were on shore; but,  owing to the quantities of arrows that came into the boats, no one thought  of taking up their arms. At last, four rounds from the bombard were fired  at them, and they no sooner heard the report than they all ran away  towards the hill, where the women were still tearing the Christian to  pieces. At a great fire they had made they roasted him before our eyes,  showing us many pieces, and then eating them. The men made signs how they  had killed the other two Christians and eaten them. What shocked us much  was seeing with our eyes the cruelty with which they treated the dead,  which was an intolerable insult to all of us.    Having arranged that more than forty of us should land and avenge such  cruel murder, and so bestial and inhuman an act, the principal captain  would not give his consent. We departed from them unwillingly, and with  much shame, caused by the decision of our captain.    We left this place, and commenced our navigation by shaping a course  between east and south. Thus we sailed along the land, making many  landings, seeing natives, but having no intercourse with them. We  sailed on until we found that the coast made a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36962"],[0,"My Attainment of the Pole (#13)"],[1,"a time could only  mutter rapidly and unintelligibly to her two little boys. Then, between  sobs, she told me her story.    Ma-nee--such was her name--was a descendant of the Eskimos of the  American side. A foreign belle, and, although thin, fair to look upon,  as Eskimo beauty goes, her hand was sought early by the ardent youths of  the tribe, who, truth to tell, look upon utility as more desirable than  beauty in a wife. The heart of Ma-nee throbbed to the pleadings of one  Ik-wa, a youth lithe and brave, with brawn and sinews as resilient as  rubber and strong as steel, handsome, dark, with flashing eyes, yet with  a heart as cruel as the relentless wind and cold sea of the North.  Ma-nee married Ik-wa and bore to him several children. These, which  meant wealth of the most valuable kind (children even exceeding in value  dogs, tusks and skins), meant the attainment of Ik-wa's selfish purpose.  Ma-nee was fair, but her hands were not adroit with the needle, nor was  she fair in the plump fashion desirable in wives.    Ik-wa met Ah-tah, a good seamstress, capable of much toil, not  beautiful, but round and plump. Whereupon, Ik-wa took Ah-tah to wife,  and leading Ma-nee to the door of their igloo, ordered her to leave.  Cruel as can be these natives, they also possess a persistence and a  tenderness that manifest themselves in strange, dramatic ways. Ma-nee,  disconsolate but brave, departed. There being at the time a scarcity of  marriageable women in the village, Ma-nee was soon wooed by another, an  aged Eskimo, whose muscles had begun to wither, whose eyes no longer  flashed as did Ik-wa's, but whose heart was kind. To him Ma-nee bore two  children, those which she had with her on deck. To them, unfortunately,  descended the heritage of their father's frailities; one--now  eight--being the only deaf and dumb Eskimo in all the land; the other,  the younger, aged three, a weakling with a pinched and pallid face and  thin, gaunt arms. Ma-nee's husband was not a good hunter, for age and  cold had sapped his vigor. Their home was peaceful if not prosperous;  the two loved one another, and, because of their defects, Ma-nee grew to  love her little ones unwontedly.    Just before the beginning of the long winter night, the old father,  anxious to provide food and deer skins for the coming months of  continuous darkness, ventured alone in search of game among the  mountains of the interior. Day after day, while the gloom descended,  Ma-nee, dry eyed waited. The aged father never came back. Returning  hunters finally brought news that he had perished alone, from a gun  accident, in the icy wilderness, and they had found him, his frozen,  mummied face peeping anxiously from the mantle of snow. Ma-nee wept  broken-heartedly.    Ma-nee gazed into the faces of the two children with a wild, tragic  wistfulness. By the stern and inviolable law of the Eskimos, Ma-nee knew  her two beloved ones were condemned to die. In this land, where food is  at a premium, and where every helpless and dependent life means a  sensible drain upon the tribe's resources, they have evolved that  Spartan law which results in the survival of only the fittest. The one  child, because of its insufficient senses, the other because it was  still on its mother's back and under three at the time its father died,  and with no father to support them, were doomed. Kind-hearted as the  Eskimos naturally are, they can at times, in the working out of that  code which means continued existence, be terribly brutal. Their fierce  struggle with the elements for very existence has developed in them an  elemental fierceness. From probable experience in long-past losses of  life from contagion, they instinctively destroy every igloo in which a  native dies, or, at times, to save the igloo, they heartlessly seize the  dying, and dragging him through the low door, cast him, ere breath has  ceased, into the life-stilling outer world.    This inviolable custom of ages Ma-nee, with a Spartan courage,  determined to break. During the long night which had just passed,  friends had been kind to Ma-nee, but now that she was defying Eskimo  usage, she could expect no assistance. Brutal as he had been to her,  hopeless as seemed such prospects, Ma-nee thought of the cruel Ik-wa and  determined to go to him, with the two defective children of her second  husband, beg him to accept them as his own and to take her, as a  secondary wife, a servant--a position of humiliation and hard labor. In  this determination, which can be appreciated only by those who know how  implacable and heartless the natives can be, Ma-nee was showing one of  their marvellous traits, that indomitable courage, persistence and  dogged hopefulness which, in my two later companions, E-tuk-i-shook and  Ah-we-lah, enabled them, with me, to reach the Pole.    I admired the spirit of Ma-nee, and promised to help her, although the  mission of reuniting the two seemed dubious.    Ma-nee was not going to Ik-wa entirely empty-handed, however, for she  possessed some positive wealth in the shape of several dogs, and three  bundles of skins and sticks which comprised her household furniture.    We soon reached the village where Ma-nee was to be put ashore. Very  humbly, the heroic mother and her two frail children went to Ik-wa's  tent. Ik-wa was absent hunting, and his wife, who had supplanted Ma-nee,  a fat, unsociable creature, appeared. Weeping, Ma-nee told of her plight  and begged for shelter. The woman stolidly listened; then, without a  word, turned her back on the forlorn mother and entered her tent. For  the unintentional part we had played she gave us exceedingly cold,  frowning looks which were quite expressive.    Ma-nee now went to the other villagers. They listened to her plans, and  their primitive faces lighted with sympathy. I soon saw them serving a  pot of steaming oil meat in her honor--a feast in which we were urgently  invited to partake, but which we, fortunately, found some good excuse  for avoiding. Although she had violated a custom of the tribe, these  people, both stern-hearted and tender, recognized the greatness of a  mother-love which had braved an unwritten law of ages, and they took her  in. Several months later, on a return to the village, I saw Ik-wa  himself. Although he did not thank me for the unwitting part I had  played in their reunion, he had taken Ma-nee back, and near his own  house was a new igloo in which the mother lived with her children.    Resuming our journey, a snow squall soon frosted the deck of the yacht,  and to escape the icy air we retired early to our berths. During the  night the speed of the yacht increased, and when we appeared on deck  again, at four o'clock in the morning, the rays of the August sun seemed  actually warm.    We passed the ice-battered and storm-swept cliffs of Cape Parry and  entered Whale Sound. On a sea of gold, strewn with ice islands of  ultramarine and alabaster, whales spouted and walrus shouted. Large  flocks of little auks rushed rapidly by.    The wind was light, but the engine took us along at a pace just fast  enough to allow us to enjoy the superb surroundings. In the afternoon we  were well into Inglefield Gulf, and near Itiblu. There was a strong head  wind, and enough ice about to make us cautious in our prospect.    We aimed here to secure Eskimo guides and with them seek caribou in  Olrik's Bay. While the schooner was tacking for a favorable berth in the  drift off Kanga, the launch was lowered, and we sought to interview the  Eskimos of Itiblu. The ride was a wet one, for a short, choppy sea  poured icy spray over us and tumbled us about.    There were only one woman, a few children, and about a score of dogs at  the place. The woman was a remarkably fast talker, long out of practice.  She told us that her husband and the other men were absent on a caribou  hunt, and then, with a remarkably rapid articulation and without a  single question from us, plunged incessantly on through all the news of  the tribe for a year. After gasping for breath like a smothered seal,  she then began with news of previous years and a history of forgotten  ages. We started back for the launch, and she invited herself to the  pleasure of our company to the beach.    We had gone only a few steps before it occurred to her that she was in  need of something. Would we not get her a few boxes of matches in  exchange for a narwhal tusk? We should be delighted, and a handful of  sweets went with the bargain. Her boy brought down two ivory tusks, each  eight feet in length, the two being worth one hundred and fifty dollars.  Had we a knife to spare? Yes; and a tin spoon was also given, just to  show that we were liberal.    The yacht was headed northward, across Inglefield Gulf. With a fair  wind, we cut tumbling seas of ebony with a racing dash. Though the wind  was strong, the air was remarkably clear.    The great chiselled cliffs of Cape Auckland rose in terraced grandeur  under the midnight sun. The distance was twelve miles, and it was twelve  miles of submerged rocks and shallow water.    It was necessary to give Karnah a wide berth. There were bergs enough  about to hold the water down, though an occasional sea rose with a  sickening thump. At Karnah we went ashore. There was not a man in town,  all being absent on a distant hunting campaign. But, though there were  no men, the place was far from being deserted, for five women, fifteen  children and forty-five dogs came out to meet us.    Here we saw five sealskin tents pitched among the bowlders of a glacial  stream. An immense quantity of narwhal meat was lying on the rocks and  stones to dry. Skins were stretched on the grass, and a general air of  thrift was evidenced about the place. Bundles of seal-skins, packages of  pelts and much ivory were brought out to trade and establish friendly  intercourse. We gave the natives sugar, tobacco and ammunition in  quantities to suit"]]]
