In these habitats it  replaces _Hyla eximia_, which inhabits the lower pine-oak forests and  mesquite-grassland on the Mexican Plateau. Ponds are absent at places  where _Hyla lafrentzi_ has been collected; possibly the eggs are laid in  streams.      ~Hyla smaragdina~ Taylor         _Hyla smaragdina_ Taylor, Copeia, No. 1:18, March 30,       1940.--6 kilometers east of Cojumatlan, Michoacan, Mexico.         _Hylella azteca_ Taylor, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 56:49,       June 16, 1943.--Tepoztlan, Morelos, Mexico.         Cojumatlan (30); Copuyo (7); 18 km. E of Dos Aguas (22);       Ostula (8); Pomaro (3); Sahuayo; Salitre de Estopilas (7).    Taylor (1940a:18) diagnosed this species as having few or no vomerine  teeth, no vocal sac, a rather broad and flat head, two large tubercles  below the anus, a granular venter, and a green dorsum in life. The  specimens on which the description was based are either immature or  non-breeding individuals; all were collected from bromeliads growing on  cacti near Cojumatlan. Another small, flat-headed hylid from Tepoztlan,  Morelos, was described and diagnosed by Taylor (1943b:49) as differing  from _Hyla smaragdina_ in having a vocal sac and a broader head. This  specimen was named _Hylella azteca_. Specimens from the coastal region  of Michoacan and Colima were referred to _Hylella azteca_ by Peters  (1954:7) and Duellman (1958c:8).    Comparison of topotypic _Hyla smaragdina_ and the holotype of _Hylella  azteca_ (UIMNH 25044) with the several series of specimens from  Michoacan has resulted in the conclusion that all pertain to only one  species. Although the type series of _Hyla smaragdina_ consists of  immature specimens, the males in that series do possess vocal sacs.  Since these were not breeding individuals, the sacs are not well  developed. The characters of the anal tubercles and the relative width  of the head are of no value in separating the two species. The  apparently aestivating individuals comprising the type series of _Hyla  smaragdina_, and the type of _Hylella azteca_, which also was found in a  bromeliad, were green in life. Of the calling males found on the coast  of Michoacan, most were yellowish tan when found; two were pale green,  but soon changed to pale tan. Calling males from Copuyo and Dos Aguas  were pale yellowish tan. Therefore the color of the dorsum is of little  significance in distinguishing the two named populations.    Males of _Hyla smaragdina_ have been found calling in the months of June  and July from rocky streams; the call is a nasal \"haah-haah-haah,\"  repeated quickly and constantly for as long as 30 seconds. As pointed  out by Duellman (1958c:9), this breeding behavior is unlike that  suggested by Taylor (1943b:51). In Michoacan _Hyla smaragdina_ has been  found in tropical semi-deciduous forest, oak forest, and  mesquite-grassland at elevations from 150 to 1500 meters.      ~Hyla smithi~ Boulenger         _Hyla smithi_ Boulenger, Zool. Rec. Reptilia and Batrachia,       38:33, 1902.--Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.         Aguililla (14); Apatzingan (104); Arteaga; Charapendo (5);       Coalcoman (11); El Sabino (44); La Playa (6); Lombardia (2);       Nueva Italia (8); Playa Azul; Salitre de Estopilas (2).    This small hylid is abundant in the Tepalcatepec Valley to elevations of  about 1000 meters; it was found infrequently on the coastal lowlands.  Males call from bushes in and around flooded fields and ditches, from  grasses and small herbs in the water and from vegetation overhanging  small streams. The call consists of a series of short, high notes,  somewhat reminiscent of a katydid's song. In the dry season occasional  males were heard calling from irrigated fields near Apatzingan. In the  daytime individuals were found in the axils of leaves of the  elephant-ear plants (_Xanthosoma_).    In living individuals the dorsal color usually is uniform pale yellow;  often the lateral white stripe is barely visible. The vocal sac is  bright yellow, and the iris is pale gold. In some individuals there are  scattered dark brown spots or flecks on the back and upper surfaces of  limbs. Twenty males from Apatzingan have the following measurements:  snout-vent length, 22.8-26.0 (25.0) mm., tibia length, 10.7-13.6 (12.6)  mm.; head width, 7.2-8.0 (7.6) mm., head length, 7.1-8.1 (7.7) mm.      ~Hypopachus caprimimus~ Taylor         _Hypopachus caprimimus_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull.,       26:526, November 27, 1940.--Agua del Obispo, Guerrero,       Mexico.         Buena Vista; Copuyo (6); Charapendo (3); Cofradia;       Jaramillo; Jungapeo; San Salvador; Tuxpan.    Specimens of _Hypopachus_ from the Balsas drainage in Michoacan have  characters consistent with topotypic _H. caprimimus_. Eleven specimens  from the southern edge of the Mexican Plateau all have the flanks darker  than the dorsum, a distinct and continuous dark stripe from the occiput  to the groin, a large dark spot in the inguinal region, and a pair of  dark transverse stripes on the thigh and shank (Pl. 6, Fig. 1). With  the exception of three specimens from Charapendo, all have a  predominantly brown venter with round, cream-colored spots.    Peters (1954:8) referred specimens from Buena Vista and San Salvador to  _Hypopachus oxyrrhinus_. He stated that the specimen (BMNH  1914.1.28.150) from San Salvador had flanks much darker than the dorsum  and a well-defined continuous stripe from the occiput to the groin; this  specimen has the characters of _H. caprimimus_. The specimen (BMNH  1914.1.28.151) from Buena Vista resembles _H. oxyrrhinus_ in some  characters, but it is not like _H. oxyrrhinus ovis_ on the Mexican  Plateau in Michoacan. The specimen has paired transverse stripes on the  hind limbs as does _H. caprimimus_, and is here referred to that  species.    In Michoacan this species has been collected in arid tropical scrub  forest at elevations of 200 to 1800 meters in the northern foothills of  the Sierra de Coalcoman, the Tepalcatepec and Tuxpan valleys, and on the  lower slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica. Calling males have been found  along streams. One specimen from Charapendo was regurgitated by a  _Leptodeira maculata_.      ~Hypopachus oxyrrhinus ovis~ Taylor         _Hypopachus ovis_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull., 26:520,       November 27, 1940.--Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico.         _Hypopachus oxyrrhinus ovis_, Shannon and Humphrey,       Herpetologica, 14:89, July 23, 1958.         Emiliano Zapata; 30 km. NW of Jacona (2); 10 km. NE of       Patzcuaro (2); Tangamandapio (16); 24 km. W of Zamora (16).    Thirty-seven specimens from the Mexican Plateau in northwestern  Michoacan agree well with the diagnosis of _Hypopachus oxyrrhinus ovis_  by Shannon and Humphrey (1958). With the exception of one specimen from  Tangamandapio, all have dark bellies extensively mottled or spotted with  cream-color. Most of the specimens have some form of an irregular,  usually broken, dark line from the occiput to the groin. In eight  specimens there is no line or linear arrangement of spots; instead the  dorsum is spotted or flecked with dark brown. The ground color of the  dorsum and flanks varies from dull reddish brown to grayish brown;  cream-colored spots are evident on the flanks and posterior surfaces of  the thighs in all specimens (Pl. 6, Fig. 2).    In comparison with 14 specimens from Queseria, Colima (UMMZ 80001-2),  individuals from the Mexican Plateau have a darker venter with bolder  markings, and a more mottled dorsum.    In Michoacan this species has been taken between 1500 and 2200 meters on  the Mexican Plateau, where it inhabits mesquite-grassland and cultivated  areas.      ~Rana dunni~ Zweifel         _Rana dunni_ Zweifel, Copeia, no. 2:78, July 15, 1957.--Lago       de Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Mexico.         Lago de Patzcuaro (23); Rio de Morelia, near Undameo (8).    Aside from the type series of this species, there are in the Museum of  Zoology at the University of Michigan six specimens taken from \"tanks\"  at the limnological station at Patzcuaro by Paul S. Martin in 1948, and  eight specimens found in shaded ditches along the Rio de Morelia by  Robert R. Miller on April 4, 1957. The Rio de Morelia flows into Lago de  Cuitzeo; this drainage is separated from Lago de Patzcuaro by a chain of  hills about 2400 meters in elevation. Dr. Richard G. Zweifel has  examined these specimens and has informed me that, although they differ  slightly from typical _Rana dunni_, they are much closer to that species  than to _Rana montezumae_.      ~Rana megapoda~ Taylor         _Rana megapoda_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull., 28:310,       November 12, 1942.--Chapala, Jalisco, Mexico.         La Palma (8).    These specimens (USNM 113998-114005) are from the marshes along the  southeastern shore of Lago de Chapala. Five females have snout-vent  lengths of 124.0-138.1 (131.5), and one male has a snout-vent length of  110.2 mm. Two juveniles have snout-vent lengths of 49.7 and 56.3 mm. The  coloration of the juveniles is more bold than that of the adults. The  body proportions of these specimens agree with those presented by  Zweifel (1957:80).      ~Rana montezumae~ Baird         _Rana montezumae_ Baird, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia,       7:61, October 20, 1854.--Mexico City, Distrito Federal,       Mexico.         La Palma; 8 km. NW of Maravatio (10); Sahuayo; Tupataro (7).    This species probably is more abundant and widespread than is indicated  by the few specimens listed above. It has been found only in the  vicinity of permanent water on the Mexican Plateau and the mountains  rising from the plateau at elevations of 1500 to 2000 meters. Its  apparent absence from Lago de Patzcuaro cannot be explained, unless  _Rana dunni_ replaces it there.      ~Rana pipiens~ Schreber         _Rana pipiens_ Schreber, Der"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33619"],[0,"Maori and Settler: A Story of The New Zealand War (#13)"],[1," I am sure you would never be a  cannibal.\"    \"There is no saying what one might be if one were driven to it,\" he  replied placidly. \"Anyhow, I trust that I shall never be driven to it.  In my various journeyings and adventures I am happy to say that I have  never been forced to experience a prolonged fast, and it is one of the  things I have no inclination to try. This weather is perfection, is it  not?\" he went on, changing the subject. \"The _Flying Scud_ is making  capital way. I only hope it may last. It is sad to think that we shall  soon exchange these balmy breezes for a biting wind. We are just saying,  Wilfrid,\" he went on as the lad strolled up to them, \"that you will soon  have to lay aside your white flannels and put on a greatcoat and  muffler.\"    \"I shall not be sorry,\" Wilfrid replied. \"After a month of hot weather  one wants bracing up a bit, and I always enjoy cold.\"    \"Then you should have gone out and settled in Iceland instead of New  Zealand.\"    \"I should not have minded that, Mr. Atherton. There is splendid  fishing, I believe, and sealing, and all that sort of thing. But I do  not suppose the others would have liked it. I am sure father would not.  He cannot bear cold, and his study at home used always to be kept up at  almost the temperature of an oven all the winter. I should think New  Zealand would exactly suit him.\"    Before the sun set they had the satisfaction of sailing out of the muddy  water of the La Plata, and of being once more in the bright blue sea.  For the next week the _Flying Scud_ sailed merrily southward without  adventure. The air grew sensibly cooler each day, and the light garments  of the tropics were already exchanged for warmer covering.    \"Do you always get this sort of weather down here, captain?\" Mrs.  Renshaw asked.    \"Not always, Mrs. Renshaw. The weather is generally fine, I admit, but  occasionally short but very violent gales sweep down from off the land.  They are known as pamperos; because, I suppose, they come from the  pampas. They are very dangerous from the extreme suddenness with which  they sweep down. If they are seen coming, and the vessel can be stripped  of her canvas in time, there is little danger to be apprehended, for  they are as short as they are violent.\"    \"We have been wonderfully fortunate altogether so far,\" Mrs. Renshaw  said. \"We have not had a single gale since we left England. I trust that  our good luck will continue to the end.\"    \"I hope so too,\" the captain said. \"I grant that a spell of such weather  as we have been favoured with is apt to become a little monotonous, and  I generally find my passengers have a tendency after a time to become  snappish and quarrelsome from sheer want of anything to occupy their  minds. Still I would very much rather put up with that than with the  chances of a storm.\"    \"People must be very foolish to get out of temper because everything is  going on well,\" Mrs. Renshaw said. \"I am sure I find it perfectly  delightful sailing on as we do.\"    \"Then you see, madam, you are an indefatigable worker. I never see your  hands idle; but to people who do not work, a long voyage of unbroken  weather must, I can very well understand, be monotonous. Of course with  us who have duties to perform it is different. I have often heard  passengers wish for what they call a good gale, but I have never heard a  sailor who has once experienced one express such a wish. However staunch  the ship, a great gale is a most anxious time for all concerned in the  navigation of a vessel. It is, too, a time of unremitting hardship.  There is but little sleep to be had; all hands are constantly on deck,  and are continually wet to the skin. Great seas sweep over a ship, and  each man has literally his life in his hand, for he may at any moment be  torn from his hold and washed overboard, or have his limbs broken by  some spar or hen-coop or other object swept along by the sea. It always  makes me angry when I hear a passenger express a wish for a gale, in  thoughtless ignorance of what he is desiring. If a storm comes we must  face it like men; and in a good ship like the _Flying Scud_, well  trimmed and not overladen, and with plenty of sea-room, we may feel  pretty confident as to the result; but that is a very different thing  from wishing to have one.\"    By the time they were a fortnight out from Buenos Ayres, Mr. Atherton  and James Allen were both off the sick-list; indeed the latter had been  but a week in the doctor's hands. The adventure had bound the little  party more closely together than before. The Allens had quite settled  that when their friends once established themselves on a holding, they  would, if possible, take one up in the neighbourhood; and they and the  young Renshaws often regretted that Mr. Atherton was only a bird of  passage, and had no intention of fixing himself permanently in the  colony. The air had grown very much colder of late, and the light  clothes they had worn in the tropics had already been discarded, and in  the evening all were glad to put on warm wraps when they came on deck.    \"I think,\" the captain said as Mr. Renshaw came up for his customary  walk before breakfast, \"we are going to have a change. The glass has  fallen a good deal, and I did not like the look of the sun when it rose  this morning.\"    \"It looks to me very much as usual,\" Mr. Renshaw replied, shading his  eyes and looking at the sun, \"except perhaps that it is not quite so  bright.\"    \"Not so bright by a good deal,\" the captain said. \"There is a change in  the colour of the sky--it is not so blue. The wind has fallen too, and I  fancy by twelve o'clock there will be a calm. Of course we cannot be  surprised if we do have a change. We have had a splendid spell of  weather, and we are getting into stormy latitudes now.\"    When the passengers went up after breakfast they found that the _Flying  Scud_ was scarcely moving through the water. The sails hung idly against  the masts, and the yards creaked as the vessel rose and fell slightly on  an almost invisible swell.    \"This would be a good opportunity,\" the captain said cheerfully, \"to get  down our light spars; the snugger we are the better for rounding the  Horn. Mr. Ryan, send all hands aloft, and send down all spars over the  topmast.\"    The crew swarmed up the rigging, and in two hours the _Flying Scud_ was  stripped of the upper yards and lofty spars.    \"She looks very ugly,\" Marion Renshaw said. \"Do you not think so, Mary?\"    \"Hideous,\" Mary Mitford agreed.    \"She is in fighting trim now,\" Mr. Atherton said.    \"Yes, but who are we going to fight?\" Marion asked.    \"We are going to have a skirmish with the weather, I fancy, Miss  Renshaw. I don't say we are going to have a storm,\" he went on as the  girls looked anxiously up at the sky, \"but you can see for yourselves  that there is a change since yesterday. The wind has dropped and the sky  is dull and hazy, the sea looks sullen, the bright little waves we were  accustomed to are all gone, and as you see by the motion of the vessel  there is an underground swell, though we can scarcely notice it on the  water.\"    \"Which way do you think the wind will come from, Mr. Atherton?\" Mary  Mitford asked.    \"I fancy it will come from the west, or perhaps north-west. Look at  those light streaks of cloud high up in the air; they are travelling to  the southeast.\"    \"Look how fast they are going,\" Mary Mitford said as she looked up, \"and  we have not a breath of wind here.\"    \"We shall have it soon,\" Mr. Atherton said. \"You see that dark line on  the water coming up from the west. I am glad to see it. It is very much  better to have the wind freshen up gradually to a gale than to lie  becalmed until it strikes you suddenly.\"    The girls stood at the poop-rail watching the sailors engaged in putting  lashings on to every movable object on deck. In ten minutes the dark  line came up to them, and the _Flying Scud_ began to move through the  water. The courses were brailed up and stowed. The wind rapidly  increased in strength, and the captain presently requested the  passengers to go below, or at any rate to give up their seats.    \"There is nothing like having the deck cleared,\" he said. \"If it comes  on to blow a bit and there is any movement, the chairs would be charging  about from side to side, and will not only break themselves up, but  perhaps break someone's leg.\"    Four sailors folded up the chairs, piled them together, and passing  cords over them lashed them to two ring-bolts.    \"Now, Mr. Ryan, we will get the topsails reefed at once. There is a  heavy bank there to windward, and we had best get everything as snug as  possible before that comes up to us.\"    The dark bank of mist rose rapidly, and the sailors had but just  reached the deck after closely reefing the topsails before it was close  upon them.    \"Now, ladies, please go below,\" the captain said sharply. \"There is rain  as well as wind in the clouds; it will come down in bucketfuls when it  does come.\"    This had the desired effect of sending most of the male passengers down  as well as the ladies. A few remained near the companion ready to make a  dive below when the squall struck them. Suddenly the wind ceased and the  topsails flapped against the masts. There was a confused roaring sound  astern, and a broad white line came along at race-horse speed towards  the vessel.    \"Get below, lads,\" Mr. Atherton said as he led the way, \"or you will be  drenched in a moment.\"    They had but just reached the cabin when there was a deafening roar  overhead, and almost at the same moment the vessel started as if struck  by a heavy blow.    \"Rain and wind together!\" Mr. Atherton shouted in reply to the chorus of  questions from those below. \"Now, all you have got to do is to make  yourselves comfortable, for there will be no going up again for some  time.\"    For five minutes the tremendous downpour continued, and then ceased "]]]
