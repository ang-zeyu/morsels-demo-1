CREON  Listen, O men of Athens, mark ye this?    OEDIPUS  They mark us both and understand that I  Wronged by the deeds defend myself with words.    CREON  Nothing shall curb my will; though I be old  And single-handed, I will have this man.    OEDIPUS  O woe is me!    CHORUS  Thou art a bold man, stranger, if thou think'st  To execute thy purpose.    CREON                           So I do.    CHORUS  Then shall I deem this State no more a State.    CREON  With a just quarrel weakness conquers might.    OEDIPUS  Ye hear his words?    CHORUS                      Aye words, but not yet deeds,  Zeus knoweth!    CREON                 Zeus may haply know, not thou.    CHORUS  Insolence!    CREON            Insolence that thou must bear.    CHORUS            Haste ye princes, sound the alarm!            Men of Athens, arm ye, arm!            Quickly to the rescue come            Ere the robbers get them home.  [Enter THESEUS]    THESEUS  Why this outcry?  What is forward? wherefore was I called away  From the altar of Poseidon, lord of your Colonus?  Say!  On what errand have I hurried hither without stop or stay.    OEDIPUS  Dear friend--those accents tell me who thou art--  Yon man but now hath done me a foul wrong.    THESEUS  What is this wrong and who hath wrought it?  Speak.    OEDIPUS  Creon who stands before thee.  He it is  Hath robbed me of my all, my daughters twain.    THESEUS  What means this?    OEDIPUS                 Thou hast heard my tale of wrongs.    THESEUS  Ho! hasten to the altars, one of you.  Command my liegemen leave the sacrifice  And hurry, foot and horse, with rein unchecked,  To where the paths that packmen use diverge,  Lest the two maidens slip away, and I  Become a mockery to this my guest,  As one despoiled by force.  Quick, as I bid.  As for this stranger, had I let my rage,  Justly provoked, have play, he had not 'scaped  Scathless and uncorrected at my hands.  But now the laws to which himself appealed,  These and none others shall adjudicate.  Thou shalt not quit this land, till thou hast fetched  The maidens and produced them in my sight.  Thou hast offended both against myself  And thine own race and country.  Having come  Unto a State that champions right and asks  For every action warranty of law,  Thou hast set aside the custom of the land,  And like some freebooter art carrying off  What plunder pleases thee, as if forsooth  Thou thoughtest this a city without men,  Or manned by slaves, and me a thing of naught.  Yet not from Thebes this villainy was learnt;  Thebes is not wont to breed unrighteous sons,  Nor would she praise thee, if she learnt that thou  Wert robbing me--aye and the gods to boot,  Haling by force their suppliants, poor maids.  Were I on Theban soil, to prosecute  The justest claim imaginable, I  Would never wrest by violence my own  Without sanction of your State or King;  I should behave as fits an outlander  Living amongst a foreign folk, but thou  Shamest a city that deserves it not,  Even thine own, and plentitude of years  Have made of thee an old man and a fool.  Therefore again I charge thee as before,  See that the maidens are restored at once,  Unless thou would'st continue here by force  And not by choice a sojourner; so much  I tell thee home and what I say, I mean.    CHORUS  Thy case is perilous; though by birth and race  Thou should'st be just, thou plainly doest wrong.    CREON  Not deeming this city void of men  Or counsel, son of Aegeus, as thou say'st  I did what I have done; rather I thought  Your people were not like to set such store  by kin of mine and keep them 'gainst my will.  Nor would they harbor, so I stood assured,  A godless parricide, a reprobate  Convicted of incestuous marriage ties.  For on her native hill of Ares here  (I knew your far-famed Areopagus)  Sits Justice, and permits not vagrant folk  To stay within your borders.  In that faith  I hunted down my quarry; and e'en then  I had refrained but for the curses dire  Wherewith he banned my kinsfolk and myself:  Such wrong, methought, had warrant for my act.  Anger has no old age but only death;  The dead alone can feel no touch of spite.  So thou must work thy will; my cause is just  But weak without allies; yet will I try,  Old as I am, to answer deeds with deeds.    OEDIPUS  O shameless railer, think'st thou this abuse  Defames my grey hairs rather than thine own?  Murder and incest, deeds of horror, all  Thou blurtest forth against me, all I have borne,  No willing sinner; so it pleased the gods  Wrath haply with my sinful race of old,  Since thou could'st find no sin in me myself  For which in retribution I was doomed  To trespass thus against myself and mine.  Answer me now, if by some oracle  My sire was destined to a bloody end  By a son's hand, can this reflect on me,  Me then unborn, begotten by no sire,  Conceived in no mother's womb?  And if  When born to misery, as born I was,  I met my sire, not knowing whom I met  or what I did, and slew him, how canst thou  With justice blame the all-unconscious hand?  And for my mother, wretch, art not ashamed,  Seeing she was thy sister, to extort  From me the story of her marriage, such  A marriage as I straightway will proclaim.  For I will speak; thy lewd and impious speech  Has broken all the bonds of reticence.  She was, ah woe is me! she was my mother;  I knew it not, nor she; and she my mother  Bare children to the son whom she had borne,  A birth of shame.  But this at least I know  Wittingly thou aspersest her and me;  But I unwitting wed, unwilling speak.  Nay neither in this marriage or this deed  Which thou art ever casting in my teeth--  A murdered sire--shall I be held to blame.  Come, answer me one question, if thou canst:  If one should presently attempt thy life,  Would'st thou, O man of justice, first inquire  If the assassin was perchance thy sire,  Or turn upon him?  As thou lov'st thy life,  On thy aggressor thou would'st turn, no stay  Debating, if the law would bear thee out.  Such was my case, and such the pass whereto  The gods reduced me; and methinks my sire,  Could he come back to life, would not dissent.  Yet thou, for just thou art not, but a man  Who sticks at nothing, if it serve his plea,  Reproachest me with this before these men.  It serves thy turn to laud great Theseus' name,  And Athens as a wisely governed State;  Yet in thy flatteries one thing is to seek:  If any land knows how to pay the gods  Their proper rites, 'tis Athens most of all.  This is the land whence thou wast fain to steal  Their aged suppliant and hast carried off  My daughters.  Therefore to yon goddesses,  I turn, adjure them and invoke their aid  To champion my cause, that thou mayest learn  What is the breed of men who guard this State.    CHORUS  An honest man, my liege, one sore bestead  By fortune, and so worthy our support.    THESEUS  Enough of words; the captors speed amain,  While we the victims stand debating here.    CREON  What would'st thou?  What can I, a feeble man?    THESEUS  Show us the trail, and I'll attend thee too,  That, if thou hast the maidens hereabouts,  Thou mayest thyself discover them to me;  But if thy guards outstrip us with their spoil,  We may draw rein; for others speed, from whom  They will not 'scape to thank the gods at home.  Lead on, I say, the captor's caught, and fate  Hath ta'en the fowler in the toils he spread;  So soon are lost gains gotten by deceit.  And look not for allies; I know indeed  Such height of insolence was never reached  Without abettors or accomplices;  Thou hast some backer in thy bold essay,  But I will search this matter home and see  One man doth not prevail against the State.  Dost take my drift, or seem these words as vain  As seemed our warnings when the plot was hatched?    CREON  Nothing thou sayest can I here dispute,  But once at home I too shall act my part.    THESEUS  Threaten us and--begone!  Thou, Oedipus,  Stay here assured that nothing save my death  Will stay my purpose to restore the maids.    OEDIPUS  Heaven bless thee, Theseus, for thy nobleness  And all thy loving care in my behalf.  [Exeunt THESEUS and CREON]    CHORUS  (Str. 1)            O when the flying foe,            Turning at last to bay,            Soon will give blow for blow,            Might I behold the fray;            Hear the loud battle roar            Swell, on the Pythian shore,            Or by the torch-lit bay,            Where the dread Queen and Maid            Cherish the mystic rites,            Rites they to none betray,            Ere on his lips is laid            Secrecy's golden key            By their own acolytes,            Priestly Eumolpidae.              There I might chance behold            Theseus our captain bold            Meet with the robber band,            Ere they have fled the land,            Rescue by might and main            Maidens, the captives twain.    (Ant. 1)            Haply on swiftest steed,            Or in the flying car,            Now they approach the glen,            West of white Oea's scaur.            They will be vanquished:            Dread are our warriors, dread            Theseus our chieftain's men.            Flashes each bridle bright,            Charges each gallant knight,            All that our Queen adore,            Pallas their patron, or            Him whose wide floods enring            Earth, the great Ocean-king            Whom Rhea bore.    (Str. 2)            Fight they or now prepare            To fight? a vision rare            Tells me that soon again            I shall behold the twain            Maidens so ill bestead,            By their kin buffeted.  Today, today Zeus worketh some great thing       This day shall victory bring.

A work of  high merit on French proverbs is the unfinished one of the Abbe Tuet,  sensible and learned. A collection of Danish proverbs, accompanied by a  French translation, was printed at Copenhagen, in a quarto volume, 1761.  England may boast of no inferior paroemiographers. The grave and  judicious Camden, the religious Herbert, the entertaining Howell, the  facetious Fuller, and the laborious Ray, with others, have preserved our  national sayings. The Scottish have been largely collected and explained  by the learned Kelly. An excellent anonymous collection, not uncommon, in  various languages, 1707; the collector and translator was Dr. J.  Mapletoft. It must be acknowledged, that although no nation exceeds our  own in sterling sense, we rarely rival the delicacy, the wit, and the  felicity of expression of the Spanish and the Italian, and the poignancy  of some of the French proverbs.    The interest we may derive from the study of proverbs is not confined to  their universal truths, nor to their poignant pleasantry; a  philosophical mind will discover in proverbs a great variety of the most  curious knowledge. The manners of a people are painted after life in  their domestic proverbs; and it would not be advancing too much to  assert, that the genius of the age might be often detected in its  prevalent ones. The learned Selden tells us, that the proverbs of  several nations were much studied by Bishop Andrews: the reason assigned  was, because \"by them he knew the minds of several nations, which,\" said  he, \"is a brave thing, as we count him wise who knows the minds and the  insides of men, which is done by knowing what is habitual to them.\" Lord  Bacon condensed a wide circuit of philosophical thought, when he  observed that \"the genius, wit, and spirit of a nation are discovered by  their proverbs.\"    Proverbs peculiarly national, while they convey to us the modes of  thinking, will consequently indicate the modes of acting among a people.  The Romans had a proverbial expression for their last stake in play,  _Rem ad triarios venisse_, \"the reserve are engaged!\" a proverbial  expression, from which the military habits of the people might be  inferred; the _triarii_ being their reserve. A proverb has preserved a  curious custom of ancient coxcombry, which originally came from the  Greeks. To men of effeminate manners in their dress, they applied the  proverb of _Unico digitulo scalpit caput_. Scratching the head with a  single finger was, it seems, done by the critically nice youths in Rome,  that they might not discompose the economy of their hair. The Arab,  whose unsettled existence makes him miserable and interested, says,  \"Vinegar given is better than honey bought.\" Everything of high esteem  with him who is so often parched in the desert is described as  _milk_--\"How large his flow of milk!\" is a proverbial expression with  the Arab to distinguish the most copious eloquence. To express a state  of perfect repose, the Arabian proverb is, \"I throw the rein over my  back;\" an allusion to the loosening of the cords of the camels, which  are thrown over their backs when they are sent to pasture. We discover  the rustic manners of our ancient Britons in the Cambrian proverbs; many  relate to the _hedge_. \"The cleanly Briton is seen in the _hedge_: the  horse looks not on the _hedge_ but the corn: the bad husband's _hedge_  is full of gaps.\" The state of an agricultural people appears in such  proverbs as \"You must not count your yearlings till May-day:\" and their  proverbial sentence for old age is, \"An old man's end is to keep sheep?\"  Turn from the vagrant Arab and the agricultural Briton to a nation  existing in a high state of artificial civilization: the Chinese  proverbs frequently allude to magnificent buildings. Affecting a more  solemn exterior than all other nations, a favourite proverb with them  is, \"A grave and majestic outside is, as it were, the _palace_ of the  soul.\" Their notion of a government is quite architectural. They say, \"A  sovereign may be compared to a _hall_; his officers to the steps that  lead to it; the people to the ground on which they stand.\" What should  we think of a people who had a proverb, that \"He who gives blows is a  master, he who gives none is a dog?\" We should instantly decide on the  mean and servile spirit of those who could repeat it; and such we find  to have been that of the Bengalese, to whom the degrading proverb  belongs, derived from the treatment they were used to receive from their  Mogul rulers, who answered the claims of their creditors by a vigorous  application of the whip! In some of the Hebrew proverbs we are struck by  the frequent allusions of that fugitive people to their own history. The  cruel oppression exercised by the ruling power, and the confidence in  their hope of change in the day of retribution, was delivered in this  Hebrew proverb--\"When the tale of bricks is doubled, Moses comes!\" The  fond idolatry of their devotion to their ceremonial law, and to  everything connected with their sublime Theocracy, in their magnificent  Temple, is finely expressed by this proverb--\"None ever took a stone out  of the Temple, but the dust did fly into his eyes.\" The Hebrew proverb  that \"A fast for a dream, is as fire for stubble,\" which it kindles,  could only have been invented by a people whose superstitions attached a  holy mystery to fasts and dreams. They imagined that a religious fast  was propitious to a religious dream; or to obtain the interpretation of  one which had troubled their imagination. Peyssonel, who long resided  among the Turks, observes that their proverbs are full of sense,  ingenuity, and elegance, the surest test of the intellectual abilities  of any nation. He said this to correct the volatile opinion of De Tott,  who, to convey an idea of their stupid pride, quotes one of their  favourite adages, of which the truth and candour are admirable; \"Riches  in the Indies, wit in Europe, and pomp among the Ottomans.\"    The Spaniards may appeal to their proverbs to show that they were a  high-minded and independent race. A Whiggish jealousy of the monarchical  power stamped itself on this ancient one, _Va el rey hasta do peude, y  no hasta do quiere_: \"The king goes as far as he is able, not as far as  he desires.\" It must have been at a later period, when the national  genius became more subdued, and every Spaniard dreaded to find under his  own roof a spy or an informer, that another proverb arose, _Con el rey y  la inquisicion, chiton!_ \"With the king and the Inquisition, hush!\" The  gravity and taciturnity of the nation have been ascribed to the effects  of this proverb. Their popular but suppressed feelings on taxation, and  on a variety of dues exacted by their clergy, were murmured in  proverbs--_Lo que no lleva Christo lleva el fisco!_ \"What Christ takes  not, the exchequer carries away!\" They have a number of sarcastic  proverbs on the tenacious gripe of the \"abad avariento,\" the avaricious  priest, who, \"having eaten the olio offered, claims the dish!\" A  striking mixture of chivalric habits, domestic decency, and epicurean  comfort, appears in the Spanish proverb, _La muger y la salsa a la mano  de la lanca_: \"The wife and the sauce by the hand of the lance;\" to  honour the dame, and to have the sauce near.    The Italian proverbs have taken a tinge from their deep and politic  genius, and their wisdom seems wholly concentrated in their personal  interests. I think every tenth proverb, in an Italian collection, is  some cynical or some selfish maxim: a book of the world for worldlings!  The Venetian proverb, _Pria Veneziana, poi Christiane_: \"First Venetian,  and then Christian!\" condenses the whole spirit of their ancient  Republic into the smallest space possible. Their political proverbs no  doubt arose from the extraordinary state of a people sometimes  distracted among republics, and sometimes servile in petty courts. The  Italian says, _I popoli s'ammazzano, ed i principi s'abbracciano_: \"The  people murder one another, and princes embrace one another.\" _Chi  prattica co' grandi, l'ultimo a tavola, e'l primo a strapazzi_: \"Who  dangles after the great is the last at table, and the first at blows.\"  _Chi non sa adulare, non sa regnare_: \"Who knows not to flatter, knows  not to reign.\" _Chi serve in corte muore sul' pagliato_: \"Who serves at  court, dies on straw.\" Wary cunning in domestic life is perpetually  impressed. An Italian proverb, which is immortalised in our language,  for it enters into the history of Milton, was that by which the elegant  Wotton counselled the young poetic traveller to have--_Il viso sciolto,  ed i pensieri stretti_, \"An open countenance, but close thoughts.\" In  the same spirit, _Chi parla semina, chi tace raccoglie_: \"The talker  sows, the silent reaps;\" as well as, _Fatti di miele, e ti mangieran le  mosche_: \"Make yourself all honey, and the flies will devour you.\" There  are some which display a deep knowledge of human nature: _A Lucca ti  vidi, a Pisa ti connobbi!_ \"I saw you at Lucca, I knew you at Pisa!\"  _Guardati d'aceto di vin dolce_: \"Beware of vinegar made of sweet wine;\"  provoke not the rage of a patient man!    Among a people who had often witnessed their fine country devastated by  petty warfare, their notion of the military character was not usually  heroic. _Il soldato per far male e ben pagato_: \"The soldier is well  paid for doing mischief.\" _Soldato, acqua, e fuoco, presto si fan  luoco_: \"A soldier, fire, and water soon make room for themselves.\" But  in a poetical people, endowed with great sensibility, their proverbs  would sometimes be tender and fanciful. They paint the activity of  friendship, _Chi ha l'amor nel petto, ha lo sprone a i fianchi_: \"Who  feels love in the breast, feels a spur in his limbs:\" or its generous  passion, _Gli amici"]]]
