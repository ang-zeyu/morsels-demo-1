Specifically, the relationships of the subfamilies  Richmondeninae, Emberizinae, and Carduelinae of the Family  Fringillidae are poorly understood. Data from two recent studies, one  on patterns of jaw-musculature and the other on features of the bony  palate, emphasize the dissimilarity of these subfamilies but have  given rise to conflicting concepts of the relationships of subfamilies  within the Family.    This paper reports the results of studies involving morphological and  biochemical features that I consider less sensitive to external  environmental factors than are features which have been studied  previously. Patterns of leg-musculature were chosen for study because  earlier work showed that muscle patterns in the legs of passerine  birds are highly stable and vary but little. Variations, therefore,  which are consistent in separating groups of species should be  significant. Serological techniques were used because the biochemical  systems involved seem to be relatively slow to change in response to  environmental influences and because the data obtained may be used in  a highly objective manner to measure resemblance among species.    Individual differences in the patterns of leg-musculature were found  to be slight and involved mainly the sizes and shapes of muscles. For  this reason variations involving origin, insertion, or relative  position of a muscle, were judged significant. In leg-musculature the  Richmondeninae, the Emberizinae, and the Thraupidae resemble one  another closely. Several differences in muscle pattern were found,  however, which distinguish these groups from the Carduelinae. The  leg-musculature of the carduelines closely resembles that of the  Ploceidae.    Serological techniques involved the extraction of saline-soluble  proteins from the tissues of the species to be studied. These extracts  were carefully processed and were used as antigens. Formolization of  the antigens was necessary as a means of preventing denaturation of  the proteins by enzymatic activity. Antisera were produced in rabbits.  The method of testing involved turbidimetric analysis of the  precipitin reaction. Utilizing the values for the precipitin tests a  model was constructed which showed the relationships of the eleven  species used in these tests. From a study of the model and the data  used in its construction, it was determined that the Richmondeninae,  Emberizinae, and Thraupidae constitute an assemblage distinct from the  other species studied. The Carduelinae are excluded from the  assemblage and serologically are most closely related to the  Estrildinae. The estrildines, serologically, do not closely resemble  _Passer_, Subfamily Passerinae, although recent classifications place  these two subfamilies in the Family Ploceidae.    Upon consideration of all evidence now available--from external  morphology, ethology, myology, osteology, and serology--several  hypotheses regarding the relationships of the groups studied are set  forth. The richmondenines, emberizines, and tanagers are closely  related subfamilies and are here included in the Family Fringillidae.  The Estrildinae and Carduelinae are closely related subfamilies, but  neither group is closely related to the Passerinae. The estrildines  and carduelines, therefore, are placed in a separate family, the  Carduelidae. In some ways, _Spiza_ is an aberrant member of the  Subfamily Richmondeninae but should be retained in that subfamily. It  is suggested that _Spiza_ is a primitive richmondenine closely related  to the ancestral fringillid stock.          LITERATURE CITED      AMERICAN ORNITHOLOGISTS' UNION       1931.

When _A_, _B_, _C_  are fitted together, if _d_ meet _e_, there is communication between any  vessels attached to _A_ and any other vessel attached to _C_, entrance  of external air being prevented by mercury being placed in the cups of  _C_ and _B_. The tap may be opened and closed at pleasure by rotating  _B_.    [15] From _Proceedings of Royal Society_, vol. XXV. p. 396.    If _A_ has to be removed, _C_ may be converted into a mercury joint _pro  tem._ by letting a little mercury from the upper cup fall into the tube  and cover _d_, the tap being closed. This mercury must be removed by a  fine pipette in order to use the tap again. It should be noted, however,  that though external air cannot enter by way of the ground glass joints,  there is no absolute protection against the passage of air between _A_  and _C_, or vessels joined to _A_ and _C_, even when the tap is closed.  The passage of air from _A_ to _C_ depends upon the grinding and  lubrication of the joint at _C_.      =Lubricating Taps.=--For general purposes resin cerate answers very  well. In special cases burnt india-rubber, or a mixture of burnt  india-rubber and vaseline will answer well, or vaseline may be used  alone. Sulphuric acid and glycerine are too fluid. When a lubricant is  wanted that will withstand the action of ether, the tap may be  lubricated by sprinkling phosphorus pentoxide upon it, and exposing it  to air till the oxide becomes gummy. The joint must then be protected  from the further action of the air if possible. For example, if a safety  tap be used the cup may be filled with mercury.    =Air-Traps.=--In Fig. 33, p. 66, an air-trap (_J_) is shown. An air-trap  is a device for preventing the mercury supplied to Sprengel pumps, etc.,  from carrying air into spaces that are exhausted, or are for any reason  to be kept free from air. Figs. 36 and 37 give examples of air-traps. In  the simpler of the two (Fig. 36) mercury flowing upwards from _C_ that  may carry bubbles of air with it passes through the bulb _A_, which is  _filled_ with mercury before use.[16] Any air which accompanies the  mercury will collect at _a_, the mercury will flow on through _b_. So  long as the level of the mercury in A is above _b_, the trap remains  effective.    [16] This may be done by clamping the tube which supplies mercury below  _C_, exhausting _A_, and then opening the clamped tube and allowing the  mercury to rise.    [Illustration: FIG. 36.]    [Illustration: FIG. 37.]    In the trap shown by Fig. 37, the tube _d_, which corresponds to _b_ in  Fig. 36, is protected at its end by the cup _E_. _E_ prevents the direct  passage of minute bubbles of air through _d_. This trap, like the other,  must be filled with mercury before it is used, and it will then remain  effective for some time.          CHAPTER V.    _GRADUATING AND CALIBRATING GLASS APPARATUS._      Although the subjects to which this concluding chapter is devoted do  not, properly speaking, consist of operations in glass-blowing, they are  so allied to the subject, and of such great importance, that I think a  brief account of them may advantageously be included.    =Graduating Tubes, etc.=--It was formerly the custom to graduate the  apparatus intended for use in quantitative work into parts of equal  capacity; for example, into cubic centimetres and fractions of cubic  centimetres. For the operations of volumetric analysis by liquids this  is still done. But for most purposes it is better to employ a scale of  equal divisions by length, usually of millimetres, and to determine the  relative values of the divisions afterwards, as described under  calibration. It rarely happens that the tube of which a burette or  eudiometer is made has equal divisions of its length of exactly equal  capacities throughout its entire length, and indeed, even for ordinary  volumetric work, no burette should be employed before its accuracy has  been verified. An excellent method for graduating glass tubes by  hand[17] has been described in Watts's _Dictionary of Chemistry_, and  elsewhere. Another excellent plan, which I have permission to describe,  has been employed by Professor W. Ramsay. It will be sufficient if I  explain its application to the operation of graduating a tube or strip  of glass in millimetre divisions.    [17] Originally suggested by Bunsen.    The apparatus required consists of a standard metre measure,[18] divided  into millimetres along each of its edges, with centimetre divisions  between them, a ruler adapted to the standard metre, as subsequently  explained, and a style with a fine point for marking waxed surfaces.    [18] Such measures can be obtained of steel for about _fifteen  shillings_ each. They are made by Mr. Chesterman of Sheffield. They can  be obtained also from other makers of philosophical instruments, at  prices depending upon their delicacy. Those of the greatest accuracy are  somewhat costly.    [Illustration: FIG. 38.]    Fig. 38 represents the standard measure, and the ruler.    At _AA_ are the millimetre divisions on the edges of the measure, the  longer transverse lines at _BB_ are placed at intervals of five  millimetres and of centimetres. The ruler is in the form of a  right-angled triangle; it is shown, by the dotted lines, in position on  the standard metre measure at _I_; and again, with its under surface  upwards, in the smaller figure at 2. It consists of a perfectly flat  sheet of metal, about ten centimetres in length from _C_ to _C_,  sufficiently thick to be rigid, and has a ledge, _DD_ in each figure,  which is pressed against the side of the measure when using it, to  ensure that the successive positions of the edge (_LL_) shall be  parallel to each other. At _GG_ are two small holes, into which fit  small screws with fine points. These must be in a line parallel to the  edge (_LL_), so that when the ruler is in position on the scale, the  points of the two screws, which project slightly, shall fall into  corresponding cuts on the divided scales (_AA_).    To graduate a strip of glass, or a glass tube (_HH_), the surface to be  marked must first be coated with wax, which should be mixed with a  little turpentine, and be applied to the surface of the glass,  previously made _warm_ and _dry_, by means of a fine brush, so as to  completely cover it with a thin, closely-adherent, and  evenly-distributed coat of wax, which must be allowed to cool.    Fix _HH_ firmly on a table, and fix the standard measure by the side of  _HH_. If the thickness of _HH_ be about equal to, but not greater than  that of the standard measure, this may be done by large drawing-pins.  If, however, a large tube or thick sheet of glass is to be graduated,  fix it in position by two strips of wood screwed to the table on each  side of it. One of these wooden strips, on which the measure may be  placed, may be about as broad as the standard measure, and of such  thickness that when the measure lies upon it beside the tube to be  graduated, the ruler, when moved along the measure, will move freely  above the tube, but will not be elevated more than is necessary to  secure free movement. The second strip of wood may be narrower, and of  the same thickness as the broader piece on which the standard measure  rests. In any case, let the standard measure and the object to be  graduated be very firmly secured in their places. Bring the ruler into  position at any desired part of the tube by placing the points of the  screws (_GG_) in corresponding divisions of the scales (_AA_). With the  style, which may be a needle mounted in a handle, make a scratch in the  wax along the edge of the ruler at _F_, move the ruler so that the  screws rest in the next divisions, and repeat the operation till the  required number of lines has been ruled. Longer marks may be made at  intervals of five and ten millimetres. Great care must be taken to hold  the needle perpendicularly, and to press it steadily against the edge  (_LL_) of the ruler in scratching the divisions.[19] The length of the  lines marking the millimetre divisions should not be too long; about 1  mm. is a good length. If they are longer than this, the _apparent_  distance between them is diminished, and it is less easy to read  fractions of millimetres. Before removing the scale to etch the glass,  carefully examine it to see that no mistakes have been made. If it is  found that any lines have been omitted, or that long lines have been  scratched in the place of short ones, remelt the wax by means of a  heated wire, and make new marks. Finally, mark the numbers on the scale  with a needle-point, or better, with a fine steel pen.    [19] To avoid variations of the position in which the needle is held  when marking the divisions, the edge (_LL_) should not be bevelled; and  an upright support may be placed upon the ruler, with a ring through  which the handle of the needle passes, thereby securing that the angle  formed by the needle and surface of the ruler is constant, and that  equal divisions are marked.    The marks on the wax should cut through it. When they are satisfactory,  they may be etched by one of the following processes:--    (1.) By moistening some cotton wool, tied to a stick, with solution of  hydrofluoric acid, and gently rubbing this over the scratched surface  for a minute or so; then washing away the acid with water, and cleaning  off the wax. This is the simplest method, but the marks made are  generally transparent, and therefore not very easy to read. The  simplicity of this method is a great recommendation, however.    (2.) Expose the tube to the fumes of hydrofluoric acid generated from a  mixture of powdered fluor-spar and strong sulphuric acid, in a leaden  trough. The marks produced in this way are usually opaque, and are  therefore very visible, and easily read.    After the above"]]]
