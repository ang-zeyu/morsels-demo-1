However, all this hatred was meant still more for Bothwell than for her:  they were pursuing Bothwell in Darnley's widow. The curses were for  Bothwell: Bothwell was the adulterer, Bothwell was the murderer,  Bothwell was the coward; while Mary was the weak, fascinated woman, who,  that same evening, gave afresh proof of her folly.    In fact, directly the falling night had scattered the crowd and a little  quiet was regained, Mary, ceasing to be uneasy on her own account,  turned immediately to Bothwell, whom she had been obliged to abandon,  and who was now proscribed and fleeing; while she, as she believed, was  about to reassume her title and station of queen. With that eternal  confidence of the woman in her own love, by which she invariably  measures the love of another, she thought that Bothwell's greatest  distress was to have lost, not wealth and power, but to have lost  herself. So she wrote him a long letter, in which, forgetful of herself,  she promised him with the most tender expressions of love never to  desert him, and to recall him to her directly the breaking up of the  Confederate lords should give her power to do so; then, this letter  written, she called a soldier, gave him a purse of gold, and charged him  to take this letter to Dunbar, where Bothwell ought to be, and if he  were already gone, to follow him until he came up with him.    Then she went to bed and slept more calmly; for, unhappy as she was, she  believed she had just sweetened misfortunes still greater than hers.    Next day the queen was awakened by the step of an armed man who entered  her room. Both astonished and frightened at this neglect of propriety,  which could augur nothing good, Mary sat up in bed, and parting the  curtains, saw standing before her Lord Lindsay of Byres: she knew he was  one of her oldest friends, so she asked him in a voice which she vainly  tried to make confident, what he wanted of her at such a time.    \"Do you know this writing, madam?\" Lord Lindsay asked in a rough voice,  presenting to the queen the letter she had written to Bothwell at night,  which the soldier had carried to the Confederate lords, instead of  taking to its address.    \"Yes, doubtless, my lord,\" the queen answered; \"but am I already a  prisoner, then, that my correspondence is intercepted? or is it no  longer allowed to a wife to write to her husband?\"    \"When the husband is a traitor,\" replied Lindsay, \"no, madam, it is no  longer allowed to a wife to write to her husband--at least, however, if  this wife have a part in his treason; which seems to me, besides, quite  proved by the promise you make to this wretch to recall him to you.\"    \"My lord,\" cried Mary, interrupting Lindsay, \"do you forget that you are  speaking to your queen.\"    \"There was a time, madam,\" Lindsay replied, \"when I should have spoken  to you in a more gentle voice, and bending the knee, although it is not  in the nature of us old Scotch to model ourselves on your French  courtiers; but for some time, thanks to your changing loves, you have  kept us so often in the field, in harness, that our voices are hoarse  from the cold night air, and our stiff knees can no longer bend in our  armour: you must then take me just as I am, madam; since to-day, for the  welfare of Scotland, you are no longer at liberty to choose your  favourites.\"    Mary grew frightfully pale at this want of respect, to which she was not  yet accustomed; but quickly containing her anger, as far as possible--    \"But still, my lord,\" said she, \"however disposed I may be to take you  as you are, I must at least know by what right you come here. That  letter which you are holding in your hand would lead me to think it is  as a spy, if the ease with which you enter my room without being asked  did not make me believe it is as a gaoler. Have the goodness, then, to  inform me by which of these two names I must call you.\"    \"Neither by one nor the other, madam; for I am simply your  fellow-traveller, chief of the escort which is to take you to Lochleven  Castle, your future residence. And yet, scarcely have I arrived there  than I shall be obliged to leave you to go and assist the Confederate  lords choose a regent for the kingdom.\"    \"So,\" said Mary, \"it was as prisoner and not as queen that I surrendered  to Lord Kirkcaldy. It seems to me that things were agreed upon  otherwise; but I am glad to see how much time Scotch noblemen need to  betray their sworn undertakings\".    \"Your Grace forgets that these engagements were made on one condition,\"  Lindsay answered.    \"On which?\" Mary asked.    \"That you should separate for ever from your husband's murderer; and  there is the proof,\" he added, showing the letter, \"that you had  forgotten your promise before we thought of revoking ours.\"    \"And at what o'clock is my departure fixed?\" said Mary, whom this  discussion was beginning to fatigue.    \"At eleven o'clock, madam.\"    \"It is well, my lord; as I have no desire to make your lordship wait,  you will have the goodness, in withdrawing, to send me someone to help  me dress, unless I am reduced to wait upon myself.\"    And, in pronouncing these words, Mary made a gesture so imperious, that  whatever may have been Lindsay's wish to reply, he bowed and went out.  Behind him entered Mary Seyton.          CHAPTER V      At the time appointed the queen was ready: she had suffered so much at  Edinburgh that she left it without any regret. Besides, whether to spare  her the humiliations of the day before, or to conceal her departure from  any partisans who might remain to her, a litter had been made ready.  Mary got into it without any resistance, and after two hours' journey  she reached Duddington; there a little vessel was waiting for her, which  set sail directly she was on board, and next day at dawn she disembarked  on the other side of the Firth of Forth in the county of Fife.    Mary halted at Rosythe Castle only just long enough to breakfast, and  immediately recommenced her journey; for Lord Lindsay had declared that  he wished to reach his destination that same evening. Indeed, as the sun  was setting, Mary perceived gilded with his last rays the high towers of  Lochleven Castle, situated on an islet in the midst of the lake of the  same name.    No doubt the royal prisoner was already expected at Lochleven Castle,  for, on reaching the lake side, Lord Lindsay's equerry unfurled his  banner, which till then had remained in its case, and waved it from  right to left, while his master blew a little hunting bugle which he  wore hanging from his neck. A boat immediately put off from the island  and came towards the arrivals, set in motion by four vigorous oarsmen,  who had soon propelled it across the space which separated it from the  bank. Mary silently got into it, and sat down at the stern, while Lord  Lindsay and his equerry stood up before her; and as her guide did not  seem any more inclined to speak than she was herself to respond, she had  plenty of time to examine her future dwelling.    The castle, or rather the fortress of Lochleven, already somewhat gloomy  in its situation and architecture, borrowed fresh mournfulness still  from the hour at which it appeared to the queen's gaze. It was, so far  as she could judge amid the mists rising from the lake, one of those  massive structures of the twelfth century which seem, so fast shut up  are they, the stone armour of a giant. As she drew near, Mary began to  make out the contours of two great round towers, which flanked the  corners and gave it the severe character of a state prison. A clump of  ancient trees enclosed by a high wall, or rather by a rampart, rose at  its north front, and seemed vegetation in stone, and completed the  general effect of this gloomy abode, while, on the contrary, the eye  wandering from it and passing from islands to islands, lost itself in  the west, in the north, and in the south, in the vast plain of Kinross,  or stopped southwards at the jagged summits of Ben Lomond, whose  farthest slopes died down on the shores of the lake.    Three persons awaited Mary at the castle door: Lady Douglas, William  Douglas her son, and a child of twelve who was called Little Douglas,  and who was neither a son nor a brother of the inhabitants of the  castle, but merely a distant relative. As one can imagine, there were  few compliments between Mary and her hosts; and the queen, conducted to  her apartment, which was on the first floor, and of which the windows  overlooked the lake, was soon left with Mary Seyton, the only one of the  four Marys who had been allowed to accompany her.    However, rapid as the interview had been, and short and measured the  words exchanged between the prisoner and her gaolers, Mary had had time,  together with what she knew of them beforehand, to construct for herself  a fairly accurate idea of the new personages who had just mingled in her  history.    Lady Lochleven, wife of Lord William Douglas, of whom we have already  said a few words at the beginning of this history, was a woman of from  fifty-five to sixty years of age, who had been handsome enough in her  youth to fix upon herself the glances of King James V, and who had had a  son by him, who was this same Murray whom we have already seen figuring  so often in Mary's history, and who, although his birth was  illegitimate, had always been treated as a brother by the queen.    Lady Lochleven had had a momentary hope, so great was the king's love  for her, of becoming his wife, which upon the whole was possible, the  family of Mar, from which she was descended, being the equal of the most  ancient and the noblest families in Scotland. But, unluckily,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2745"],[0,"Karl Ludwig Sand (#13)"],[1,"knew the object of my inquiries, stopped of himself and asked me  whether I should not like to see the place where Sand was executed. At  the same time he pointed to a little mound situated in the middle of a  meadow and a few steps from a brook. I assented eagerly, and although  the driver remained on the highroad with my travelling companions, I  soon recognised the spot indicated, by means of some relics of cypress  branches, immortelles, and forget-me-nots scattered upon the earth. It  will readily be understood that this sight, instead of diminishing my  desire for information, increased it. I was feeling, then, more than  ever dissatisfied at going away, knowing so little, when I saw a man of  some five-and-forty to fifty years old, who was walking a little  distance from the place where I myself was, and who, guessing the cause  that drew me thither, was looking at me with curiosity. I determined to  make a last effort, and going up to him, I said, \"Oh, sir, I am a  stranger; I am travelling to collect all the rich and poetic traditions  of your Germany. By the way in which you look at me, I guess that you  know which of them attracts me to this meadow. Could you give me any  information about the life and death of Sand?\"    \"With what object, sir?\" the person to whom I spoke asked me in almost  unintelligible French.    \"With a very German object, be assured, sir,\" I replied. \"From the  little I have learned, Sand seems to me to be one of those ghosts that  appear only the greater and the more poetic for being wrapped in a  shroud stained with blood. But he is not known in France; he might be  put on the same level there with a Fieschi or a Meunier, and I wish, to  the best of my ability, to enlighten the minds of my countrymen about  him.\"    \"It would be a great pleasure to me, sir, to assist in such an  undertaking; but you see that I can scarcely speak French; you do not  speak German at all; so that we shall find it difficult to understand  each other.\"    \"If that is all,\" I returned, \"I have in my carriage yonder an  interpreter, or rather an interpretress, with whom you will, I hope, be  quite satisfied, who speaks German like Goethe, and to whom, when you  have once begun to speak to her, I defy you not to tell everything.\"    \"Let us go, then, sir,\" answered the pedestrian. \"I ask no better than  to be agreeable to you.\"    We walked toward the carriage, which was still waiting on the highroad,  and I presented to my travelling companion the new recruit whom I had  just gained. The usual greetings were exchanged, and the dialogue began  in the purest Saxon. Though I did not understand a word that was said,  it was easy for me to see, by the rapidity of the questions and the  length of the answers, that the conversation was most interesting. At  last, at the end of half an hours growing desirous of knowing to what  point they had come, I said, \"Well?\"    \"Well,\" answered my interpreter, \"you are in luck's way, and you could  not have asked a better person.\"    \"The gentleman knew Sand, then?\"    \"The gentleman is the governor of the prison in which Sand was  confined.\"    \"Indeed?\"    \"For nine months--that is to say, from the day he left the hospital--  this gentleman saw him every day.\"    \"Excellent!\"    \"But that is not all: this gentleman was with him in the carriage that  took him to execution; this gentleman was with him on the scaffold;  there's only one portrait of Sand in all Mannheim, and this gentleman  has it.\"    I was devouring every word; a mental alchemist, I was opening my  crucible and finding gold in it.    \"Just ask,\" I resumed eagerly, \"whether the gentleman will allow us to  take down in writing the particulars that he can give me.\"    My interpreter put another question, then, turning towards me, said,  \"Granted.\"    Mr. G----got into the carriage with us, and instead of going on to  Heidelberg, we returned to Mannheim, and alighted at the prison.    Mr. G---did not once depart from the ready kindness that he had shown.  In the most obliging manner, patient over the minutest trifles, and  remembering most happily, he went over every circumstance, putting  himself at my disposal like a professional guide. At last, when every  particular about Sand had been sucked dry, I began to ask him about the  manner in which executions were performed. \"As to that,\" said he, \"I can  offer you an introduction to someone at Heidelberg who can give you all  the information you can wish for upon the subject.\"    I accepted gratefully, and as I was taking leave of Mr. G----, after  thanking him a thousand times, he handed me the offered letter. It bore  this superscription: \"To Herr-doctor Widemann, No. III High Street,  Heidelberg.\"    I turned to Mr. G----once more.    \"Is he, by chance, a relation of the man who executed Sand?\" I asked.    \"He is his son, and was standing by when the head fell.\".    \"What is his calling, then?\"    \"The same as that of his father, whom he succeeded.\"    \"But you call him 'doctor'?\"    \"Certainly; with us, executioners have that title.\"    \"But, then, doctors of what?\"    \"Of surgery.\"    \"Really?\" said I. \"With us it is just the contrary; surgeons are called  executioners.\"    \"You will find him, moreover,\" added Mr. G----, \"a very distinguished  young man, who, although he was very young at that time, has retained a  vivid recollection of that event. As for his poor father, I think he  would as willingly have cut off his own right hand as have executed  Sand; but if he had refused, someone else would have been found. So he  had to do what he was ordered to do, and he did his best.\"    I thanked Mr. G----, fully resolving to make use of his letter, and we  left for Heidelberg, where we arrived at eleven in the evening.    My first visit next day was to Dr. Widernann. It was not without some  emotion, which, moreover, I saw reflected upon, the faces of my  travelling companions, that I rang at the door of the last judge, as the  Germans call him. An old woman opened the door to us, and ushered us  into a pretty little study, on the left of a passage and at the foot of  a staircase, where we waited while Mr. Widemann finished dressing. This  little room was full of curiosities, madrepores, shells, stuffed birds,  and dried plants; a double-barrelled gun, a powder-flask, and a game-bag  showed that Mr. Widemann was a hunter.    After a moment we heard his footstep, and the door opened. Mr. Widemann  was a very handsome young man, of thirty or thirty-two, with black  whiskers entirely surrounding his manly and expressive face; his morning  dress showed a certain rural elegance. He seemed at first not only  embarrassed but pained by our visit. The aimless curiosity of which he  seemed to be the object was indeed odd. I hastened to give him Mr.  G----'s letter and to tell him what reason brought me. Then he gradually  recovered himself, and at last showed himself no less hospitable and  obliging towards us than he to whom we owed the introduction had been,  the day before.    Mr. Widemann then gathered together all his remembrances; he, too, had  retained a vivid recollection of Sand, and he told us among other things  that his father, at the risk of bringing himself into ill odour, had  asked leave to have a new scaffold made at his own expense, so that no  other criminal might be executed upon the altar of the martyr's death.  Permission had been given, and Mr. Widemann had used the wood of the  scaffold for the doors and windows of a little country house standing in  a vineyard. Then for three or four years this cottage became a shrine  for pilgrims; but after a time, little by little, the crowd grew less,  and at the present day, when some of those who wiped the blood from the  scaffold with their handkerchiefs have became public functionaries,  receiving salaries from Government, only foreigners ask, now and again,  to see these strange relics.    Mr. Widemann gave me a guide; for, after hearing everything, I wanted to  see everything. The house stands half a league away from Heidelberg, on  the left of the road to Carlsruhe, and half-way up the mountain-side. It  is perhaps the only monument of the kind that exists in the world.    Our readers will judge better from this anecdote than from anything more  we could say, what sort of man he was who left such a memory in the  hearts of his gaoler and his executioner.                                            ----"]]]
