This habit could be  particularly important for the young of the year and may be one reason  why they often continue to den with their mothers during winter (Lotze  and Anderson, 1979; Seidensticker et al., 1988). Raccoons that live in  colder climates, such as Minnesota, undoubtedly obtain the same  advantage from a den as Virginia animals, but because of their greater  body mass, longer fur, and potentially lower C_{mw}, T_{lc} of a  Minnesota raccoon in a den could be even lower than what we calculated  for Virginia raccoons. Therefore, when they are in their dens, raccoons  living in very cold climates also may be able to maintain homeothermy  with a basal level of metabolism.        THERMOREGULATION AT HIGH TEMPERATURES      _Background_    In hot environments mammals depend on behavior to minimize their  thermal load (escape to shaded or cooler microclimates, use posture  and orientation to wind and sun, restrict activity, become nocturnal,  etc.) and on evaporative water loss to rid themselves of excess heat.  With regard to evaporative heat loss, Calder and King (1974:326)  arbitrarily subdivided the response to various T_{a}'s as follows:  \"(1) cool temperatures at which water loss should be minimized, both  to reduce heat loss and as an adaptation to terrestriality; (2) an  intermediate temperature range wherein evaporation is gradually  increased as dry heat losses are proportionately reduced with smaller  thermal gradients; and (3) warm to hot temperatures at which  evaporation must be actively increased to dispose of metabolic and  exogenous heat loads.\" Some mammals are able to thermoregulate very  well at high ambient temperatures via panting or sweating, whereas  others have a very limited capacity. Hence, there is no general  approach to calculating evaporative water loss under these conditions  (Campbell, 1977:85). However, the ratio of evaporative heat lost to  metabolic heat produced can be used to quantify a species' capacity  for evaporative cooling and to make comparisons between species.      _Comparison of Procyonid Responses to Heat Stress_    _Potos flavus._--This species lives in Neotropical forests of Central  and South America. It is nocturnal, arboreal in habit, and appears to  be the most heat-sensitive of these procyonids. Its T_{uc} is at 30 deg.C  to 33 deg.C (Table 7; Mueller and Kulzer, 1977; Mueller and Rost, 1983). It  begins to pant at about 30 deg.C, but its efforts at evaporative cooling  are very ineffective. At 33 deg.C _Potos flavus_ can dissipate 33% of its  metabolic heat via evaporative water loss, but at 35 deg.C the efficiency  of this mechanism falls to 20% (Mueller and Rost, 1983). Consequently,  when exposed to T_{a}'s above 33 deg.C, any kind of excitement causes its  T_{b} to rise rapidly in an uncontrolled manner (Mueller and Kulzer,  1977; Mueller and Rost, 1983). These animals rely on their nocturnal  and arboreal habits to keep them out of situations that could lead to  hyperthermia (Mueller and Kulzer, 1977; Mueller and Rost, 1983).    _Nasua nasua_ and _Nasua narica_.--_Nasua nasua_ is abundant in  tropical and subtropical South America, whereas _Nasua narica_ occupies  the same climates in North America from southern Arizona and New Mexico  south through Panama and on into Colombia and Ecuador (Hall and Kelson,  1959:892; Ewer, 1973:391, 392; Poglayen-Neuwall, 1975). Both coatis  are diurnal and forage primarily on the ground (Kaufmann, 1962:185-188,  1987; Poglayen-Neuwall, 1975; Nowak and Paradiso, 1983:982),  consequently they are exposed to a more severe thermal environment  while active (higher T_{a}'s and solar radiation) than are nocturnal  procyonids. Both coatis are more heat-tolerant than _Potos flavus_;  their T_{uc}'s are higher (33 deg.C-35 deg.C; Table 7), they can tolerate  T_{a}'s of 35 deg.C without raising their T_{b}'s (Chevillard-Hugot et al.,  1980; Mugaas et al., in prep.), and they have a greater capacity for  evaporative cooling than _Potos flavus_ (Mugaas et al., in prep.). The  greater heat tolerance of these coatis is compatible with their diurnal  habits and widespread distribution in a variety of forest habitats in  both tropical and subtropical areas of the western hemisphere.    _Bassariscus astutus._--In addition to living in Neotropical forests of  Mexico, _Bassariscus astutus_ also flourishes in hot arid climates, and  it has extended its range much farther north than _Nasua narica_ (Hall  and Kelson, 1959:881,892; Poglayen-Neuwall, 1975; Kaufmann, 1982). Its  T_{uc} is higher (35.5 deg.C; Table 7) than that of _Potos flavus_, but it  is comparable to those of _Nasua nasua_ and _Nasua narica_. Its capacity  for evaporative cooling is well developed; at 40 deg.C _Bassariscus astutus_  is able to dissipate 100% of its resting metabolic heat via evaporative  water loss, and at 45 deg.C it is able to dissipate 172% (Chevalier, 1985).  In spite of its great capacity for evaporative cooling, this species is  nocturnal, a habit that, along with its low [.H]_{b}, should allow it  to keep thermoregulatory water requirements to a minimum.    _Procyon lotor._--Our data suggested that T_{uc} for _Procyon lotor_ in  winter was comparable to that for _Bassariscus astutus_ (35 deg.C), and  that in summer it was even higher. When exposed to temperatures near  the upper end of its T_{n}, _Procyon lotor_ increased the gradient for  passive heat loss with a controlled rise in T_{b} (Figure 6). In summer  its capacity for passive heat loss was enhanced by the molt of its  heavy winter fur. _Procyon lotor_'s capacity for evaporative cooling  also appeared to be well developed, although our animals were not  heated to the point that evaporative cooling was fully expressed  (Figures 4, 5). However, _Procyon lotor_ is nocturnal, and this may  allow it to eliminate, or at least reduce, the need for evaporative  cooling, even in hot climates. Thus, _Procyon lotor_ appears to be  well equipped physiologically and behaviorally to cope with thermal  demands of hot environments in its distribution.    _Procyon cancrivorus._--Unfortunately, data for the crab-eating  raccoon are not complete enough at high temperatures to include it in  this survey.    SUMMARY.--This comparison demonstrates that capacity for evaporative  cooling, tolerance of an elevated T_{b} to enhance passive heat loss,  and behavioral avoidance of thermal stress are the primary methods used  by procyonids to thermoregulate at high temperatures. _Procyon lotor_  and _Bassariscus astutus_, whose distributions extend into temperate  regions, have developed these abilities to a greater extent than other  procyonids. _Potos flavus_, whose distribution is confined to  lowland tropical forests, has the least ability in this regard. _Nasua  nasua_ and _Nasua narica_ appear to have thermoregulatory abilities  that are intermediate to those of _Bassariscus astutus_ and _Potos  flavus_. This suggests that ancestral procyonids may have had poor to  modest ability to thermoregulate at high temperatures, a condition that  would have limited their ability to leave the thermal stability  afforded by tropical forests. Dispersal into temperate climates,  therefore, required not only increased cold tolerance but also  selective enhancement of those mechanisms used in thermoregulation at  high temperatures.

COMPOSITE SCORES OF ADAPTIVE UNITS AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION      In Table 11, procyonid species are arranged in descending order with  respect to the number of major climates that are included in their  geographic distributions (Hall and Kelson, 1959:878-897;  Poglayen-Neuwall, 1975; Kortlucke and Ramirez-Pulido, 1982; Nowak and  Paradiso, 1983:977-985). Composite scores ranged from a high of 1.47  for _Procyon lotor_ to a low of 0.39 for _Potos flavus_, whereas  _Nasua nasua_, _Nasua narica_, _Procyon cancrivorus_, and _Bassariscus  astutus_ had intermediate values ranging from 0.64 to 0.79 (Table 12).  Figure 8 demonstrates that there is a direct relationship between the  number of climates these species occupy and their composite scores.  Regression analysis (Y = 2.68.X + 0.24; where Y is number of climates,  and X is composite score) demonstrates a high degree of correlation  between these variables (R = 0.94) and indicates that 89% of the  variance in distribution can be explained by composite scores. The  various combinations of adaptations expressed by these species do,  therefore, play a role in delimiting their climatic (latitudinal)  distributions.    _Procyon lotor's_ normalized scores were higher in all categories than  those of other procyonids. _Procyon lotor_, therefore, possesses those  traits that have allowed it to become the premier climate generalist  of the procyonid family. As an adaptive unit, these traits provide  _Procyon lotor_ with the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36069"],[0,"Explorers and Travellers (#13)"],[1,"May, 1757, and in early  youth, inspired with the spirit of independence which dominated the  American Colonies, entered the naval service during the war of the  Revolution, wherein he served with credit as an officer.    At the termination of the war it is probable that he continued his  natural or acquired vocation as a seaman. At all events, we find him  first and foremost among that band of American citizens whose courage,  energy, and nautical skill enabled them to attain unsurpassed success as  whalers and sealers in the Antarctic Ocean, as traders dealing direct  with China, or as explorers and fur dealers on the unsurveyed and  dangerous coast of northwest America.    In 1787, J. Barrell, S. Brown, C. Bulfinch, J. Darby, C. Hatch, and J,  M. Pintard, merchants of Boston, associated for the purpose of combining  the fur traffic of the northwest coast of America with the silk and tea  trade of China. For this purpose they sent, under the command of Captain  John Kendrick, in 1787, the ship Columbia and the sloop Washington with  cargoes of blankets, knives, iron bars, and other articles suitable for  the northwest trade. They were provided with sea letters issued  according to a resolution of Congress, with passports from the State of  Massachusetts, and with commendatory letters from the Spanish minister  plenipotentiary to the United States.    Captain Kendrick, who commanded the Columbia, was a man of marked  ability and great energy, who withal had most enthusiastic opinions as  to the future of the Pacific Coast region, which he believed would in a  few years utterly dwarf the growing importance of the Atlantic seaboard.  Gray was the master of the Washington, and his professional standing in  the eyes of the merchants of Boston was shown by his designation as the  most desirable officer to assume command in case of death or injury to  Captain Kendrick.    Many aspersions have been cast by English writers on the policy pursued  and methods followed by Americans engaged in trading with the Indians of  the northwest coast of America. Doubtless such reflections were  justified in individual cases of Americans, as of traders of other  nationality; but the instructions given by the merchants of Boston to  Kendrick and Gray show that fair, honest, and peaceful methods were  regarded as the true means of establishing a permanent and profitable  trade. Among other injunctions were the following:    \"If you make any fort or any improvement of land on the coast, be sure  you purchase the soil of the natives.... Let the instrument of  conveyance bear every authentic mark that circumstances will admit....  We cannot forbear to impress on your mind our will and expectation that  the most inviolable harmony and friendship may subsist between you and  the natives, and that no advantage may be taken of them in trading, but  that you endeavor by honest conduct to impress on their minds a  friendship for Americans.\" While enjoining peace, it was not to be a  peace on any terms, for thus runs the instructions: \"The sea letters  from Congress and this State you will show on every proper occasion, and  although we expect you will treat all nations with respect and civility,  yet we depend you will suffer insult and injury from none without  showing that spirit which becomes a free and independent American.\"    The vessels sailed from Boston September 30, 1787, via the Cape Verde  and Faulkland Islands, and in January doubled Cape Horn, when they  thought the perils of storm were past. In latitude 59 deg. S., however, a  violent gale arose, which not only separated them, but also seriously  damaged the Columbia. The storm over, Kendrick found himself in a sad  plight, his consort gone, perhaps lost, his ship in an unseaworthy  condition, and the nearest spot for repairs a thousand miles distant.  This port, that of the island of Juan Fernandez, if now famous and  delightful to the adventurous mind through its associations with the  fascinating tale of Robinson Crusoe, was then most objectionable from  the fact that it was under Spanish rule and so was to be avoided by  Kendrick, whose instructions ran as follows:    \"You are strictly enjoined not to touch at any port of the Spanish  dominion on the western continent of America, unless driven there by  unavoidable accident, in which case you are to give no offence to any of  the subjects of his Catholic Majesty.\"    Kendrick, to his surprise, was received with great kindness and aided in  repairing his injured vessel by Don Blas Gonzales, the humane commandant  of the Spanish garrison of Juan Fernandez.    Spain at this time claimed the right of exclusive jurisdiction over the  entire western continent of America by virtue of the papal concession,  1493, and by right of discovery. It had failed to colonize the northwest  coast of America, but it prohibited other nations from entering in  possession. It now illustrated its narrow and jealous policy in its  treatment of a subordinate who had ventured to assist a vessel in  distress and provided with letters from the accredited minister of Spain  to the United States. Ambrose O'Higgins, then captain-general of Chili,  under whom Gonzales was serving, on hearing of this act recalled him and  put him in arrest, pending definite orders from his own superior, Teodor  Lacroix, viceroy of Peru. After due consideration of the case the  unfortunate commandant, Gonzales, was cashiered for his remissness in  allowing a strange ship to leave Juan Fernandez instead of seizing her  and her crew. The viceroy set forth to the captain-general of Chili the  legal opinion that by the royal ordinance of November, 1692, every  foreign vessel found in those seas without a license from the court of  Spain was to be treated as an enemy, even though belonging to a friend  or ally of the king, \"seeing that no other nation had, or ought to have,  any territories, to reach which its vessels should pass around Cape Horn  or through Magellan's Straits.\" The viceroy therefore sent a ship from  Callao to track or intercept the Columbia; the authorities on the coasts  of Peru and Chili were especially enjoined to be vigilant, and in case  any foreign vessel should appear in the country to seize her.    Under Gray's skilful handling the Washington escaped unharmed from the  hurricane, and continuing his course toward King George Sound, the  concerted rendezvous, he made the American coast, about 46 deg. N., in  August, 1788. Here he barely escaped loss of his vessel in trying to  cross the bar of an unknown river, probably the Columbia, when his ship  grounded. He, however, visited shore, and found that the sea was  perchance the less inhospitable of the two, for he was so savagely and  violently attacked by swarms of Indians that he was very glad to escape  therefrom with one seaman dead and the mate wounded.    Quitting this unfortunate place he sailed north and entered Nootka  Sound, Vancouver Island, September 17, 1788, where he found two English  vessels, the Felice and Iphigenia, sailing under the Portuguese flag and  commanded by Captains Meares and Douglass. There were no signs of the  Columbia, but her arrival a few days later relieved Gray from further  anxiety in this respect.    [Illustration: Indian Maul.]    Douglass's vessel, the Iphigenia, was in serious need of supplies and  assistance, which Gray generously furnished. Later he not only made to  the northward a successful trading trip, but in the following year, in  June, 1789, explored the whole east coast of Queen Charlotte Islands, to  which he gave the name of Washington Islands, in honor of General  Washington, then President of the United States. In another trading  excursion from Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island, Gray entered the broad  opening southeast of the island and sailed to the east-southeast fifty  miles, where he found the passage still five leagues wide. This opening  was the Straits of Fuca, and the first authentic exploration of the  strait is the account of Gray. The credit of first passing through the  entire length of the Straits of Fuca is due to Kendrick, who made the  passage in the sloop Washington, after the departure of Gray to China on  the Columbia.    The account of the passage of the Washington through the Straits of Fuca  was especially called to Vancouver's attention by the British Admiralty  on the occasion of his surveying voyage of 1791, when he was  particularly to \"examine the supposed Strait of Juan de Fuca, said to be  situated between the forty-eighth and forty-ninth north latitude, and to  lead to an opening through which the sloop Washington was reported to  have passed in 1789, and to have come out again to the northward of  Nootka.\" Vancouver later denied to Americans the credit of first sailing  entirely through the Straits of Fuca, resting his opinion on Gray's  statement that he sailed only fifty miles within it, which was true; the  credit belonging to Kendrick in his voyage with the Washington after  Gray's departure from the coast in 1789.    The efforts of Kendrick and Gray resulted in the obtaining of a full  cargo of furs, which in accordance with their instructions were to be  sold in China. Kendrick, fascinated with the prospects of fortune and  success, and perhaps reluctant to face his owners owing to his lack of  caution which resulted in the unfortunate killing of some thirty  natives, decided to remain on the northwest coast, his imaginary  Eldorado.    Gray consequently transferred to the Columbia and set sail for Canton,  then the great fur mart of the world. His voyage across the Pacific was  prosperous, his furs were readily sold, and after taking a cargo of tea  on board, Gray sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, and on the 10th of  August, 1790, the Columbia entered the port of Boston, the first vessel  to circumnavigate the world under the flag of the United States.    His success and conduct so impressed the owners of the "]]]
