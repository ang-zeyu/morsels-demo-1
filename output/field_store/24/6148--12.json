It was a caterpillar.\"    \"Well; what's the difference?\"    \"A true worm never turns into an insect,\" she informed him. \"It goes  creeping around through life, a worm and nothing more; while a  caterpillar changes at last into a beautiful butterfly, or moth. This  was a caterpillar once,\" she ended, raising the net with her captured  prize for his inspection.    \"You are a strange girl,\" observed the boy. \"I never knew one before who  cared about such things. Where did you learn it?\"    \"I get it from my father,\" responded she with pride. \"He is Doctor  William Raymond, a noted lepidopterist. He has been all over the world  just to study butterflies. What does your father do?\"    \"Haven't got any.\" The boy thrust his hands into his pockets, and stared  at her cheerfully.    \"Haven't you? I am so sorry. It must be dreadful to be without a  father,\" spoke Bee with genuine commiseration.    \"Oh, I don't know. I guess from what I've heard that they are pretty  much of a nuisance. You see they always want to handle the cash, and my  mother and I would rather keep that in our own hands.\"    \"I don't care to talk with you any longer,\" remarked Bee, turning away  from him. \"You say such awful things. My father isn't a nuisance,  whatever yours may have been.\"    \"Say! I didn't mean your father. I don't know anything about him. He may  be all right. I never knew a father who was a lepi--what do you call  'em? They may be different. Does he let you have the money?\"    \"Of course not,\" answered Bee indignantly. \"He gives me an allowance  that I can spend as I please.\"    \"That's all right. I think that is the proper thing,\" declared the lad,  anxious to propitiate her. \"It wouldn't do for me, you know, because I'm  a man.\"    \"A pretty poor sort of one,\" flashed the girl. She started to go back  into the road, intending to go on to the postoffice, when the boy called  imploringly:    \"Don't go yet. I like you even if you do catch butterflies and worms.  Come over and see me; won't you?    \"I don't visit boys,\" loftily. \"Besides, I don't know where you live.\"    \"We live in the big white house just beyond you,\" he told her in an  injured tone. \"You people are so inhospitable. I thought Missouri folks  were nice to strangers. My mother feels bad about it. We have been here  a whole month, and you haven't even noticed that we lived next to you.\"    \"We have not been home very long ourselves,\" explained Bee, touched by  the allusion to Missouri. \"You see, my father has been away from me for  a long, long time, and we have been so busy getting acquainted with  each other that we have not paid much attention to other people. Perhaps  we will come over to see you. I'll ask him. I must go on now; so,  good-bye.\"    \"I'll just go along with you,\" said the boy, swinging into step by her  side. \"You see my pony lost a shoe, and I had to wait for him to be  shod, so I walked out here a ways when I saw you coming. I'll just take  you back in my cart. It is a long, hot walk.\"    \"Will you?\" asked Bee gratefully. It was a long distance, and after the  chase the butterfly had given her she was glad of the offer. \"It is very  kind of you.\"    \"Oh, that's all right,\" he said in an offhand manner. \"I like to be  obliging to my friends; and we are going to be friends, you know.\"    \"Are we?\" asked Bee, laughing outright. \"Why, how do you know that you  will care to be after you know me?\"    \"We've got to be,\" he replied. \"We live next to each other, and it would  be so convenient. I made up my mind that we'd be friends when I first  saw you.\"    \"But you said that I was rude,\" reminded Bee. \"I shouldn't think that  you would want to be friends with a rude girl.\"    \"You said a few things, too,\" he retorted, laughing. \"Are you going in  here?\" as Bee stopped before the postoffice. \"Then I'll bring the cart  here. Be sure you wait.\"    He scampered away, and Bee entered the office. There was a letter for  her father, and the girl congratulated herself that the offer of the  ride would enable her to get it to him quickly. She was anxious, too, to  show him that she had succeeded with the butterfly. She had not long to  wait until her new-found acquaintance appeared with his pony and cart.    \"This is not really my pony,\" the boy told her as he assisted her into  the cart. \"The cart is mine, but my mother just hired the pony until she  could find one to suit. Though this one is pretty nice.\"    \"Indeed it is,\" remarked Beatrice approvingly, as the little pony  started off at a brisk pace. \"Why don't you get this one?\"    \"They won't sell,\" said the boy. \"I can have it until the fellow to whom  it belongs comes home. He's away now.\"    \"I see,\" said she. And thus chatting she soon reached home. \"I thank  you very, very much,\" she said as she jumped out. \"I do hope that we  shall be friends.\"    \"And you didn't ask my name,\" reproached the urchin. \"No; I shan't tell  you now. If you want to know, just come over. Good-bye!\"    \"Good-bye,\" she called after him. \"I certainly shall come over to find  out. I want to know.\"    \"So your chase led you to the office after all,\" laughed her father as  she ran into the study, taking the net and the letter from her at the  same time. \"I had no idea that you would catch it. You have done well,  though I am sorry that you had such a long, hot, dusty walk.\"    \"I did not walk back, father. We have a new neighbor in the white house,  and the boy brought me home in his pony cart.\" Bee sank into a chair and  began to fan herself, watching him as he carefully removed the butterfly  from the bag, and placed it in the poison jar. \"Isn't it a beauty?\"    \"Yes;\" replied Doctor Raymond, beginning the perusal of his letter. He  looked up suddenly. \"Beatrice, I shall be obliged to leave you for a few  days. They wish to see me at the university. Would you rather go to  your Aunt Annie's than to stay here?\"    \"I would rather stay here, father,\" she answered promptly. \"There is so  much to do.\"    \"Just as you wish, my child. I'll ask Mrs. Jenkins to come over to be  with you nights. Then with the servants here I shall not be uneasy.  Don't do any cataloguing while I am away. A few days rest will do you  good. Now I must throw a few things into my grip if I expect to catch  the afternoon train. It is fortunate that you went for the mail.\"    \"Let me pack your things for you, father,\" pleaded Bee. \"I know exactly  what you will need. Aunt Annie says that I do nicely. I always did it  for her, and for Uncle Henry, too, sometimes.\"    \"Very well, Beatrice. I have done those things so long for myself that  it will seem strange to have it done for me; but it will be none the  less pleasant for all that.\" And there was a very kindly light in the  look which he gave his daughter as she left the room.          Chapter XI    An Infant Prodigy        \"By the sweet power of music: therefore, the poet      Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods:      Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,      But music for the time doth change his nature.\"        --_Merchant of Venice. Shakespeare._      Lonely and distrait Bee wandered about the house the next day unable to  settle down to anything.    \"What if father should go away again for ten years,\" she thought with  sudden dismay. \"I don't believe that I could live. I could not stand it  without him now. What if he should!\"    Troubled by this thought she sat down on the veranda steps, and leaned  listlessly against a post. For some time she sat there musing, but  presently was aroused from her meditations by the sound of music. Bee  raised her head and listened intently.    \"I have heard that several times of late,\" she said, glad of the  diversion. \"I wonder where it comes from? I am going to find out.\"    She rose, listened again to catch the strain, then began to walk in the  direction from whence it came. Through the garden and orchard, across  the fields to the arbor vitae hedge which separated their land from their  neighbor's she went, the music becoming more and more distinct.  Beethoven's Romance in G was being played, although Bee did not know  what it was, and the musician was executing it with wonderful technique.    Always susceptible to the influence of music the girl stood spellbound.  Presently the performance stopped abruptly, and a sweet voice--sweet  despite a certain querulous note in it--said sharply:    \"Percival, that last was entirely too fast. What would Heinrich say to  you?\"    \"I don't give a cent what he'd say,\" retorted a boyish voice petulantly.  \"I'm tired of practicing. I want to have some fun. I guess I'm a boy as  well as a violinist.\"    \"Don't be silly, Percival. Of course you are. Now practice just one  hour more, and we will see about that pony this afternoon.\"    \"You said that yesterday,\" returned the boy's voice sulkily, \"but you  didn't do a thing about it.\"    \"I will today, dear, sure. I was too tired yesterday.\"    \"Honor bright?\"    \"Yes; honor bright.\"    \"All right. If you don't attend to it today I won't touch this old  violin again this summer. So there!\"    Beatrice was an unwilling listener to the foregoing dialogue. Not  wishing that her presence should be unknown, and curious as to the  identity of the musician, she drew aside some branches of the arbor vitae  hedge, and looked through.    The boy of the knickerbockers and long curls stood under a large tree,  his chin resting upon a violin which he held in his left hand, while  with his right he tapped restlessly upon his shoe with the bow. A rack  upon which were some sheets of music stood before him.    \"Oh!\" exclaimed Bee in surprise as she saw who the musician was.    The lad heard her and ran to the opening eagerly.    \"It's the funny girl!\" he called joyfully. \"Mamma, see! It's the  butterfly girl.

Tell you about the elephants again? Why, I have given you a dozen  stories at least about them this voyage! Well, if you must have it,  here goes.    You must know, then, that about two years before, (like a great fool  that I was,) I left my dear native island: I accompanied my father, and  twenty or thirty of our tribe, on an elephant-catching expedition, to  the banks of a large river more than fifty miles from our village. We  were five days on our journey, for we had to pass through deep and  tangled forests. As our object was merely to procure the valuable  tusks, which we bartered at the Dutch settlement, for linen cloth, and  other European articles, we did not attempt to take our game alive, but  contented ourselves with digging deep pit-falls in the forest-paths  made by the elephants in their visits to the river-side; for you must  know that elephants are very fond of bathing and splashing about in the  water. These pits of ours were slightly covered over with branches of  trees and grass, and at the bottom we fixed a strong, sharp-pointed  stake, on which, when they tumbled down headlong, the unwieldy animals  were impaled and killed. We always took care to bait our traps with  green boughs and tempting fruits. When we were so fortunate as to  entrap an elephant in this manner, some of our party would descend to  cut out the valuable tusks with a hatchet; and as we were quite unable  to raise the immense carcass out of the pit, we were obliged to fill it  up and dig another.    This method of catching elephants was generally adopted by our nation,  for at that time fire-arms were not in use among us. But I have heard  that in some countries, when the hunters wish to take the animals  alive, they make large enclosures of very strong stakes, and employ  tame elephants to entice the wild ones inside, when the door is shut,  and they are immediately bound fast with ropes, and kept without food  for several days, till they are partly tamed. But I must return to our  expedition.    At this time we were very unfortunate indeed. Though the herd of  elephants was numerous, and we had dug a great number of pit-falls,  more than a week had passed, and we had made only one capture, a very  young animal whose tusks were hardly worth taking home. This bad luck  was not occasioned by our want of skill, for some of our party, my  father and elder brother in particular, were the most experienced  hunters of our nation, and our traps were covered over and baited with  the greatest care. It was of no use; after the little fellow who met  with his fate on the second day of our falling in with the herd, not a  single elephant would venture his life for the most tempting baits we  could select; and in some places where the path was so narrow that  there was no room to pass the trap, these provoking animals would  either return, or make another track by the side of it, by tearing up  the trees with their trunks, and trampling down the bushes and  underwood.    \"This will never do!\" said my father; \"these rascals are too cunning  for us. We must find another herd. If we do not get some ivory soon,  the Dutch ships will have left the port, and then we shall not be able  to sell our tusks for a pretty while.\"    So it was agreed, that the next day we would move further up the river,  in hopes of falling in with a less sagacious herd. But the same  afternoon a circumstance occurred which explained the cause of our want  of success in a very satisfactory manner, to _me_ at least, though some  of our company were so stupid as to say that what I am now going to  relate was all nonsense, and that I had been dreaming.    I was stationed in the upper part of a lofty tree within view of one of  our pit-falls, when I perceived three elephants approaching. Two were  of moderate size, but the third was by far the largest animal I had  ever seen or heard of. He seemed almost decrepit with age, and had a  very remarkable appearance, from one of his immense tusks being broken  off, leaving a ragged stump of about a foot in length. He and his  companions had been enjoying a cool bathe in the river, as I could  perceive from the light-coloured mud on their legs and sides, and their  way lay directly by the trap I was appointed to watch. But this peril  they took especial care to avoid. However, I observed the old elephant  point at it with his trunk, whereupon they all three tossed up their  heads with an indignant snort. So they paced leisurely along till they  reached my tree, at the foot of which, the old gentleman, apparently  exhausted with fatigue, threw himself down on his side so suddenly,  that he occasioned a partial earthquake. The others kept watch by him.    After lying perfectly still for about an hour, during which time, we  may safely conclude that he was refreshed by a comfortable nap, the  venerable patriarch raised his immense bulk till he was in a sort of  squatting posture, and began to converse with his companions; but I was  at such a great height above him, that I could only catch a word or two  here and there. But what are you laughing at, Bill Stacey? Do you think  everybody is as deaf and as stupid as yourself? You had better say at  once that you don't believe I could understand the elephant's language,  and then I'll leave off and turn in for the rest of the watch. Well,  then, behave yourself, my boy, and don't interrupt me any more, or I  won't say another word to-night.    Let me see, where was I? Oh, I told you that I was too high up in the  tree to make out what the elephants were saying, but no doubt their  conversation related to the pitfall, as the old fellow grumbled out the  words, \"stupid idiots!\" \"shallow contrivance!\" and \"whoever saw fruit  growing on a beaten path?\" Hoping to gain some useful information, I  now, with extreme caution, descended from the top of the tree till I  reached a branch about twenty feet from the ground, and concealed  myself among the thick leaves. For some time after I had been in this  situation there was a dead silence below, and I almost feared that the  elephants had heard or smelt me, and were meditating some mischief. But  there was a strong breeze blowing, and this prevented them from hearing  me. In a few minutes, the patriarch, after casting a very affectionate  glance on his companions, and giving utterance to a tremendous grunt,  which I suppose he meant for a _sigh_, though you might have heard it  at the distance of a mile, began a sort of history of his life, which I  will repeat, if Bill Stacey will be quiet.                     *       *       *       *       *    (_The old_ ELEPHANT _speaks for himself at last_.)    True, my dear children, I have often promised to relate to you as much  as I can remember of my long life and experience, and as my increasing  bodily infirmities warn me that my days are drawing to a close, I  cannot do better than embrace this opportunity when we are not likely  to be interrupted by our companions.    I am now going to put you in possession of a secret, which I should be  very unwilling to make public. It is universally believed by our  company, that I have spent many years in the service of man, and that  at this period of my life, I acquired that knowledge of his ways which  has been so useful in enabling me to detect and avoid his wicked  devices for the destruction of our noble race. To this belief I am  indebted for the influence I possess in our councils, and though my  years and experience might still be respected, I am certain, that the  ungrateful herd, ever fond of change, would immediately choose a new  leader, if they had the least suspicion of what I am going to  communicate to you.    Know, then, my children, that I have never been a slave to the tyrant!  that I have never been that most abject of creatures, \"_a tame  elephant_.\" No! my last days are not embittered by the consideration,  that I have ever in the smallest degree contributed to the happiness of  the two-legged monster. On the contrary, I am cheered by the  recollection, that a great part of my life has been spent in detecting  his tricks, and in thwarting his wicked designs. If our laws did not  forbid us to take the life of any creature except in self-defence, with  my knowledge of our enemies' weakness, we might easily take such  terrible vengeance, as would induce him at least to confine himself to  the neighbourhood of his own towns and settlements. But he cannot do us  much injury. So successful have I been in detecting his ridiculous  traps and pit-falls, that, for the last fifty years, not one of our  herd has fallen a victim to his vile designs, except the poor young  creature who threw his life away a few days ago, when, foolishly  confident in his own knowledge, he persisted in rambling about by  himself. Even in this melancholy affair, we may comfort ourselves that  we could better spare him than any other of his companions, and that  our enemies have gained little or nothing by his capture.    But you will ask, if I have never been the companion of man, by what  means have I obtained that superior intelligence and knowledge of his  arts, for which our tribe are pleased to give me credit? I answer,  simply by keeping my _eyes_ and my _ears_ open, and by remembering what  I have _seen_ and _heard_. Follow my example, my dear children, and if  you ever arrive at my age, you will no longer wonder at the extent of  my information.    Now let me endeavour to remember some of the most remarkable incidents  of my life. I have but a confused recollection of my very early  childhood, or of anything that happened before my thirteenth year, but  about that time I well remember I was in terrible distress at the loss  of my first tusks, and that my"]]]
