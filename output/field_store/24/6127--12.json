This is the product of the linden or basswood, of all  the trees in our forest the one most beloved by the bees. Melissa, the  goddess of honey, has placed her seal upon this tree. The wild swarms  in the woods frequently reap a choice harvest from it. I have seen  a mountain side thickly studded with it, its straight, tall, smooth,  light-gray shaft carrying its deep-green crown far aloft, like the  tulip-tree or the maple.    In some of the Northwestern States there are large forests of it, and  the amount of honey reported stored by strong swarms in this section  during the time the tree is in bloom is quite incredible. As a shade and  ornamental tree the linden is fully equal to the maple, and if it were  as extensively planted and cared for, our supplies of virgin honey would  be greatly increased. The famous honey of Lithuania in Russia is the  product of the linden.    It is a homely old stanza current among bee folk that--       \"A swarm of bees in May      Is worth a load of hay;      A swarm of bees in June      Is worth a silver spoon;      But a swarm in July      Is not worth a fly.\"    A swarm in May is indeed a treasure; it is, like an April baby, sure  to thrive, and will very likely itself send out a swarm a month or  two later; but a swarm in July is not to be despised; it will store no  clover or linden honey for the \"grand seignior and the ladies of his  seraglio,\" but plenty of the rank and wholesome poor man's nectar, the  sun-tanned product of the plebeian buckwheat. Buckwheat honey is the  black sheep in this white flock, but there is spirit and character in  it. It lays hold of the taste in no equivocal manner, especially when at  a winter breakfast it meets its fellow, the russet buckwheat cake. Bread  with honey to cover it from the same stalk is double good fortune. It is  not black, either, but nut-brown, and belongs to the same class of goods  as Herrick's       \"Nut-brown mirth and russet wit.\"    How the bees love it, and they bring the delicious odor of the blooming  plant to the hive with them, so that in the moist warm twilight the  apiary is redolent with the perfume of buckwheat.    Yet evidently it is not the perfume of any flower that attracts  the bees; they pay no attention to the sweet-scented lilac, or to  heliotrope, but work upon sumach, silkweed, and the hateful snapdragon.  In September they are hard pressed, and do well if they pick up enough  sweet to pay the running expenses of their establishment. The purple  asters and the golden-rod are about all that remain to them.    Bees will go three or four miles in quest of honey, but it is a great  advantage to move the hive near the good pasturage, as has been the  custom from the earliest times in the Old World. Some enterprising  person, taking a hint perhaps from the ancient Egyptians, who had  floating apiaries on the Nile, has tried the experiment of floating  several hundred colonies north on the Mississippi, starting from New  Orleans and following the opening season up, thus realizing a sort of  perpetual May or June, the chief attraction being the blossoms of the  river willow, which yield honey of rare excellence. Some of the bees  were no doubt left behind, but the amount of virgin honey secured must  have been very great. In September they should have begun the return  trip, following the retreating summer South.    It is the making of the wax that costs with the bee. As with the poet,  the form, the receptacle, gives him more trouble than the sweet that  fills it, though, to be sure, there is always more or less empty comb in  both cases. The honey he can have for the gathering, but the wax he must  make himself--must evolve from his own inner consciousness. When wax  is to be made the wax-makers fill themselves with honey and retire into  their chamber for private meditation; it is like some solemn religious  rite; they take hold of hands, or hook themselves together in long lines  that hang in festoons from the top of the hive, and wait for the miracle  to transpire. After about twenty-four hours their patience is rewarded,  the honey is turned into wax, minute scales of which are secreted from  between the rings of the abdomen of each bee; this is taken off and from  it the comb is built up. It is calculated that about twenty-five pounds  of honey are used in elaborating one pound of comb, to say nothing of  the time that is lost. Hence the importance in an economical point of  view, of a recent device by which the honey is extracted and the comb  returned intact to the bees. But honey without the comb is the perfume  without the rose,--it is sweet merely, and soon degenerates into candy.  Half the delectableness is in breaking down these frail and exquisite  walls yourself, and tasting the nectar before it has lost its freshness  by the contact with the air. Then the comb is a sort of shield or foil  that prevents the tongue from being overwhelmed by the shock of the  sweet.    The drones have the least enviable time of it. Their foothold in the  hive is very precarious. They look like the giants, the lords of the  swarm, but they are really the tools. Their loud, threatening hum has  no sting to back it up, and their size and noise make them only the more  conspicuous marks for the birds.    Toward the close of the season, say in July or August, the fiat goes  forth that the drones must die; there is no further use for them. Then  the poor creatures, how they are huddled and hustled about, trying to  hide in corners and by-ways. There is no loud, defiant humming now, but  abject fear seizes them. They cower like hunted criminals. I have seen  a dozen or more of them wedge themselves into a small space between the  glass and the comb, where the bees could not get hold of them or where  they seemed to be overlooked in the general slaughter. They will also  crawl outside and hide under the edges of the hive. But sooner or later  they are all killed or kicked out. The drone makes no resistance, except  to pull back and try to get away; but (putting yourself in his place)  with one bee a-hold of your collar or the hair of your head, and another  a-hold of each arm or leg, and still another feeling for your waistbands  with his sting, the odds are greatly against you.    It is a singular fact, also, that the queen is made, not born. If the  entire population of Spain or Great Britain were the offspring of one  mother, it might be found necessary to hit upon some device by which a  royal baby could be manufactured out of an ordinary one, or else give  up the fashion of royalty. All the bees in the hive have a common  parentage, and the queen and the worker are the same in the egg and in  the chick; the patent of royalty is in the cell and in the food; the  cell being much larger, and the food a peculiar stimulating kind of  jelly. In certain contingencies, such as the loss of the queen with no  eggs in the royal cells, the workers take the larva of an ordinary bee,  enlarge the cell by taking in the two adjoining ones, and nurse it and  stuff it and coddle it, till at the end of sixteen days it comes out a  queen. But ordinarily, in the natural course of events, the young queen  is kept a prisoner in her cell till the old queen has left with the  swarm. Later on, the unhatched queen is guarded against the reigning  queen, who only wants an opportunity to murder every royal scion in the  hive. At this time both the queens, the one a prisoner and the other at  large, pipe defiance at each other, a shrill, fine, trumpet-like note  that any ear will at once recognize. This challenge, not being allowed  to be accepted by either party, is followed, in a day or two by the  abdication of the reigning queen; she leads out the swarm, and her  successor is liberated by her keepers, who, in her time, abdicates  in favor of the next younger. When the bees have decided that no more  swarms can issue, the reigning queen is allowed to use her stiletto upon  her unhatched sisters. Cases have been known where two queens issued at  the same time, when a mortal combat ensued, encouraged by the workers,  who formed a ring about them, but showed no preference, and recognized  the victor as the lawful sovereign. For these and many other curious  facts we are indebted to the blind Huber.    It is worthy of note that the position of the queen cells is always  vertical, while that of the drones and workers is horizontal; majesty  stands on its head, which fact may be a part of the secret.    The notion has always very generally prevailed that the queen of the  bees is an absolute ruler, and issues her royal orders to willing  subjects. Hence Napoleon the First sprinkled the symbolic bees over the  imperial mantle that bore the arms of his dynasty; and in the country  of the Pharaohs the bee was used as the emblem of a people sweetly  submissive to the orders of its king. But the fact is, a swarm of bees  is an absolute democracy, and kings and despots can find no warrant in  their example. The power and authority are entirely vested in the great  mass, the workers. They furnish all the brains and foresight of the  colony, and administer its affairs. Their word is law, and both king and  queen must obey. They regulate the swarming, and give the signal for the  swarm to issue from the hive; they select and make ready the tree in the  woods and conduct the queen to it.    The peculiar office and sacredness of the queen consists in the fact  that she is the mother of the swarm, and the bees love and cherish her  as a mother and not as a sovereign. She is the sole female bee in the  hive, and the swarm clings to her because she is their life. Deprived  of their queen, and of all brood from which to rear one, the swarm loses  all heart "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31630"],[0,"Hand-Loom Weaving: A Manual for School and Home (#13)"],[1,"can be made  in the same way. These should be fringed all around. A cross-barred  cloth or spread can be made by putting the color in the warp at regular  intervals and weaving across with color and white to form squares.  Pretty quilts of coarse cotton can be made with kindergarten designs. By  weaving many squares, a large quilt can be made. See directions on page  50.    [Sidenote: _Bed and carriage blankets_]    Bed and carriage blankets are best made of single zephyr, although  Germantown wool will do. The heavy carpet wools are also pretty. Some  suggestions for this work have already been given under the head of  Materials. These blankets are really mats, but made only for another  use, and are to be woven in a similar way. Those with centers and  borders are pretty, and the plaid ones are always attractive. (See  illustration of the holder on page 92.)    [Sidenote: _Doll shawls_]    For doll shawls choose a pretty Scotch plaid and match the colors in  fine wool. String a close warp with wool, copying the Scotch plaid  exactly. Weave the colors across so that a \"truly\" plaid shawl may grace  Miss Dolly's shoulders on the cold winter mornings. A striped shawl is  pretty, or one having one color for the center and another for the  border.    [Sidenote: _Doll skirt_]    Miss Dolly may have a lovely petticoat, too. String a continuous warp  long enough for the width of the skirt. Adjust the rods for the length.  By using a little color in the warp near the right edge of the weaving,  the skirt will have some stripes. Twist a cord of the wool and run in  the top for a draw-string.    [Sidenote: _Reins_]    To make reins, adjust for a narrow strip and string a close, continuous  warp the length desired. Make a piece, also, to go across the front. Use  Germantown knitting yarn. A black warp with a bright red woof is pretty.    [Sidenote: _A square Tam O'Shanter_]    In order to obtain a Tam O'Shanter for Dolly, first weave a square the  required size. String a close warp with wool and weave a kindergarten  pattern with two colors. When completed, remove from the loom, fold four  corners to the center, turn them in to form an opening for the head, and  fasten the edges by sewing, or by lacing with a cord made of the two  colors. Fasten a tassel on the top and it is finished. Angora wool is  pretty for these caps.    [Illustration: _Fringe for a rug in red and black_]    [Sidenote: _Fringe_]    [Sidenote: _Threading the needle_]    [Sidenote: _Making the fringe into tassels_]    [Sidenote: _Removing the fringe from the loom_]    The head piece of the loom should be adjusted for the width of the rug  for which the fringe is required. A rug nine inches wide would require  fringe nine inches long. Adjust the rods one inch apart--that is, with  one perforation between the rods. String the warp in every groove, one  string over each rod and three between, making five in all. Weave over  and under one until the heading is finished. If you have an extra side  rod, place it in the sixth perforation from the right-hand rod. This  will make tassels a little over two inches long. If a shorter fringe is  preferred, adjust accordingly. If you have not an extra side rod remove  the _left_ one and place as directed, leaving the _right_ one in the  heading until the whole fringe is finished. Thread a large tape needle  with two pieces of worsted, as long as the two can be conveniently  managed. If the fringe is made of two colors, take one of each for the  tassels, weaving the heading with the one which predominates in the rug.  Run the ends in the grooves to fasten them. Wind under the right rod,  which was left in the heading, through the first stitch, which includes  the warp string over the rod, then over the extra rod to the right. Wind  under again through the next stitch in the heading (always around the  rod) and so on until the end is reached. To make this fringe into  tassels, separate six strands of each color and tie with the two colors,  running the tape needle and worsted along from one tassel to another, or  tie each one securely and cut. The fringe will need no finishing at the  ends. Run the short ends, which were wound through the grooves in the  beginning in order to fasten them, through a few stitches in the  heading. The fringe can be made of one color, and of any width. To take  the fringe from the loom, first remove the rod at the end of the tassels  and cut the fringe before removing the rods from the heading. This will  insure straight cutting at the ends of the tassels. If one prefers a  knotted fringe, cut and knot before removing the heading. By examining  rug fringes in the furniture stores one can get a very good idea of the  manner of knotting. (See also directions for splicing Germantown wool on  page 84.)    [Sidenote: _Knotting_]    A simple fringe can be knotted quickly and easily in the ends of the  warp strings, after the rug is taken from the loom. First decide upon  the length of the fringe when finished. Add at least two inches to allow  for knotting. Cut each piece of wool twice this length, double, and  thread a tape needle. Pass the needle from the right side of the rug to  the wrong, through the warp strings at the end of the rug. Draw the loop  of wool through and unthread the needle. Pass the two ends of the wool  down through the loop and draw it tight. When this has been done in  every pair of warp strings, knot every other piece of the fringe  together, in the same way that towel fringe is made.    This question of whether a rug should have fringe or not is much  discussed at present. It is largely a personal one. The best way,  perhaps, is to study different kinds of rugs and know which ones are  usually made with fringe and which are not.    [Illustration: _Bed shoes made of white wool_]    [Sidenote: _Bed shoes, or socks_]    [Sidenote: _Bed shoes_]    [Sidenote: _Baby shoes_]    Bed shoes of all sizes are easily woven, and make a useful holiday gift.  They are made without soles and are intended to be drawn up around the  ankle like a high moccasin. Use the soft double Germantown wool. White,  fastened together with pink or blue, or white striped with a color, may  be used, and are attractive. The socks in the illustration are of white  wool with a pink seam up the instep and pink scallops around the top.  One sock is shown on a last, and the other as it appears off the foot.  The stripes in the knitting can be shown in the weaving by using a  color. The full size of the loom makes a shoe of medium size. String a  close warp with white wool. If the shoe is to be all white, weave with  the same, leaving the color for the finishing. If it is to be striped,  weave perhaps eight or ten times across with color and then with white;  when the weaving is finished you will have a mat 9 x 12 inches. Double  one of the short edges and sew over and over on the wrong side with  white wool. This is the toe. The two long edges now lie together. They  may be crocheted, or knitted, with colored wool by holding them close  and fulling in, or by _puckering_ a little. If this is done in color,  it makes a pretty seam on the top of the foot and front of the ankle.  The top may be finished by crocheting a beading and scallops of the  colored wool. Run a ribbon or worsted cord through the beading. If  desired, the long edges may be laced together with ribbon one-half inch  wide. Baby shoes are made in the same way. To ascertain what length to  adjust the loom, measure the sole, then up, back of the heel, to a point  above the ankle. For the width, measure around the foot. Finish the cord  with tassels or balls.    [Sidenote: _Worsted balls for bed shoes, and other articles_]    To make worsted balls, first cut two small circles from cardboard. From  the center of each cut a smaller circle. Hold one circle over the other,  and with a worsted or tape needle threaded with wool, wind over and over  very closely until the hole in the center is completely filled. Always  piece the wool on the _outside_ edge. Cut the wool all around on the  outside. Make a cord of the wool and slip _between_ the two circles.  Then tie so as to fasten all the pieces of wool in the middle, leaving  the cord long enough to tie in a bow if desired. Tear the pasteboards,  remove them, and trim the wool evenly. A second ball should be fastened  on the other end of the cord, _after_ it has been laced through the  beading.    [Sidenote: _Photograph frames_]    To weave photograph and picture frames of silk, chenille, raffia,  celluloid, or leather, proceed in the same way as for a bordered rug,  having the oblong or square center the required size for the picture.  Foundation frames for mounting the work can be purchased, usually, at  the stores where tissue paper and flowers are sold.    [Sidenote: _Table mats_]    Square and oblong table mats for hot dishes can be made of  candle-wicking, knitting cotton, or cheese cloth.    [Sidenote: _Tippet or scarf_]    To-day, tippets and scarfs are very little used, but they are very  comfortable things to wear to school on a cold day. In order to make  them, string a continuous warp of the required length with Germantown  dark colored wool. Weave the same color for the woof, and brighten it at  intervals with Roman stripes. A plaid scarf can be woven, if preferred;  while with a close warp one can have a kindergarten pattern in another,  or contrasting color.    [Sidenote: _Wristlets_]    In making wristlets, one must decide how long they are to be, and adjust  the length on the loom. Measure around the wrist for the width,  remembering that the wristlets will stretch when pulled over the hand.  Weave in stripes or plaid, or, if desired, plain, stringing the warp  with the same wool as is used in weaving. Remove the mat and sew the  edges together.    [Sidenote: _Sleeve protectors_]    Sleeve protectors can be woven of raffia in the same way as wristlets.  Make them so they"]]]
