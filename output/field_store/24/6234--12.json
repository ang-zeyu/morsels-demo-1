Each mud pill must be carried to the barn and  fastened on to the rafter. Countless trips are made to the puddle  before a sufficient number of pellets are worked into the deep mud  walls of the ample nursery. Usually grass is mixed with the mud, but  some swallows make their bricks without straw. A lining of fine hay  and plenty of feathers from the chicken yard seem to be essential for  their comfort, which is a pity, because almost always chicken feathers  are infested with lice, and lice kill more young birds than we like to  think about. When there is a nestful of fledglings to feed, sticky  little pellets of insects, caught on the wing, are carried to them by  both parents from daylight to dusk. Do notice how tirelessly they  work!    In a family famous for graceful, rapid flight, the barn swallow easily  excels all his relations. The deep fork in his tail enables him to  steer {100} himself with those marvellously quick, erratic turns,  which make his course through the air resemble forked lightning. But  with what exquisite grace he can also glide and skim across the water,  fields and meadows without an apparent movement of the wing! His  flight seems the very poetry of motion. The ease of it accounts for  the very wide distribution of barn swallows from southern Brazil in  winter to Greenland and Alaska in summer. What a journey to take twice  a year!      THE EAVE OR CLIFF SWALLOW    More than any other bird family, the swallows are becoming  increasingly dependent for shelter upon man, at least when they are  nesting; and as this is the season when they are most valuable to him  because of the enormous numbers of insects they prevent from  multiplying, let us hope that familiarity with us will never breed  contempt and cause them to return to their old, uncivilised building  sites. In the sparsely settled West, the cliff swallow still fastens  its queer, gourd-shaped, mud nest against projecting rocks, but in the  East it is so quick to take advantage of the eaves of the barns and  other out-buildings, that its old name does not apply, and we know it  here only as an eave swallow.    {101}    The barn swallow, as we have seen, chooses to nest upon the rafters  inside the barn, but the eave swallow is content to stay outside under  the shelter of a projecting roof. In such a place you find not one,  but several or many mud tenements plastered in a row against the wall,  for eave swallows are always remarkably sociable, even at the nesting  season. A photograph of a colony I have seen shows one hundred and  fifteen nests nearly all of which touch one another.    Although so often noticed circling about barns, you may know by the  rusty patch on the lower part of his steel-blue back, the  crescent-shaped white mark on his forehead, and the notched, not  deeply forked tail, that the eave swallow is not the barn swallow,  which it otherwise resembles.      THE BANK SWALLOW    _Called also: Sand Martin; Sand Swallow_    Perhaps you have seen a sand bank somewhere, probably near a river or  pond, where the side of the bank was filled with holes as if a small  cannon had been trained against it as a target. In and out of the  holes fly the smallest of the swallows, with no lovely metallic blue  or glistening buff in their dull {102} plumage, which is plain  brownish gray above, white underneath, with a grayish band across the  breast. Only their cousin, the rough-winged swallow, whose breast is  brownish gray, is so plainly dressed.    The giggling twitter of the bank swallows as they wheel and dart  through the air above you, proves that they are never too busy hunting  for a dinner to speak a cheerful word to their friends. Year after  year a colony will return to a favourite bank, whose face has been  honey-combed with such care. Think of the labour and patience required  for so small a bird to dig a tunnel two feet deep, more or less! Some  nests have been placed as far as four feet from the entrance. You are  not surprised at the big kingfisher, who also tunnels a hole in a bank  for his family, because his long, strong bill makes digging  comparatively easy; but for the small-billed, weak-footed swallow, the  work must be difficult indeed. What a pity they cannot hire moles to  make the tunnels with their strong, flat, spade-like feet. No wonder  the birds become attached to the tunnels that have cost so much  labour. When there are no longer any baby swallows on the heaps of  twigs, grass and feathers at the end of them, the birds use them as  resting places by day as well as by night until it is time to gather  in vast flocks and speed away to the tropics.    {103}    THE TREE SWALLOW    _Called also: White-breasted Swallow_      Probably this is the most abundant swallow that we have; certainly  countless numbers assemble every year in the Long Island and Jersey  marshes, perch on the telegraph wires and skim, with much circling,  above the meadows and streams in a perfect ecstasy of flight. At a  little distance the bird appears to be black above and white below,  but as he suddenly wheels past, you see that his coat is a lustrous  dark steel green. Immature birds are brownish gray. All have white  breasts.    As the tree swallows are the only members of their family who spend  the winter in the Southeastern United States, they can easily arrive  at the North some time before their relatives from the tropics  overtake them. And they are the last to leave. Myriads remain in the  vicinity of New York until the middle of October. There is plenty of  time to rear two broods, which accounts for the great size of the  flocks. By the Fourth of July the young of the first broods are off  hunting for little gauzy-winged insects over the low lands; and about  a month later the parents join their flock, bringing with them more  youngsters than you could count. They sleep every night in the  marshes, clinging to the reeds.    {104}    Like the cliff swallow, the tree swallow is fast losing the right to  its name. It takes so kindly to the boxes we set up for martins,  bluebirds and wrens that, where sparrows do not interfere, it now  prefers them to the hollow trees, which once were its only shelter.  But some tree swallows still cling to old-fashioned ways and at least  rest in hollow trees and stumps, even if they do not nest in them.  Some day they may become as dependent upon us as the martins and, like  them, refuse to nest where boxes are not provided.    {105}    CHAPTER VIII    THE SPARROW TRIBE      Song Sparrow    Swamp Sparrow    Field Sparrow    Vesper Sparrow    English Sparrow    Chipping Sparrow    Tree Sparrow    White-throated Sparrow    Fox Sparrow    Junco    Snowflake    Goldfinch    Purple Finch    Indigo Bunting    Towhee    Rose-breasted Grosbeak    Cardinal Grosbeak    {106}    {107}    THE SPARROW TRIBE    Like the poor, the sparrows are always with us. There is not a day in  the year when you cannot find at least one member of the great tribe  which comprises one-seventh of all our birds--by far the largest North  American family. What is the secret of their triumphant numbers?    Many members of the hardy, prolific clan, wearing dull brown and  gray-streaked feathers, in perfect colour harmony with the grassy,  bushy places or dusty roadsides where they live, are usually  overlooked by enemies in search of a dinner. Undoubtedly their  protective colouring has much to do with their increase. They are  small birds mostly, not one so large as a robin.    Sparrows being seed eaters chiefly, although none of the tribe  refuses insect meat in season, and all give it to their nestlings,  there is never a time when they cannot find food, even at the frozen  North where some weedy stalks project above the snow. They are not  fastidious. Fussy birds, like fussy people, have a hard time in this  world; but the whole sparrow tribe, with few exceptions, make the best  of things as they {108} find them and readily adapt themselves to  whatever conditions they meet. How wonderfully that saucy little  gamin, the English sparrow, has adjusted himself to this new land!    Members of the more aristocratic finch and grosbeak branches of the  family, however, who wear brighter clothes, pay the penalty by  decreasing numbers as our boasted civilisation surrounds them. Gay  feathers afford a shining mark. Naturally grosbeaks prefer to live  among protective trees. They are delightful singers, and so, indeed,  are some of their plain little sparrow cousins.    All the members of the family have strong, conical bills well suited  to crush seeds, and gizzards, like a chicken's, to grind them fine.  These little grist-mills within the birds' bodies extract all the  nourishment there is from the seed. The sparrow tribe, you will  notice, do immense service by destroying the seeds of weeds, which,  but for them, would quickly overrun the farmer's fields and choke his  crops. Because these hardy gleaners can pick up a living almost  anywhere, they do not need to make very long journeys every spring and  autumn. Their migrations are comparatively short when undertaken at  all. As a rule their flight is laboured, slow, and rather heavy--just  the opposite from the wonderfully swift and graceful flight of the  swallows.    {109}    THE SONG SPARROW    This is most children's favourite bird: is it yours? Although by no  means the belle of the family, the song sparrow is beloved throughout  its vast range if for no other reason than because it is irrepressibly  cheerful. Good spirits are contagious: every one feels better for  having a neighbour always in a good humour. Most birds mope when it  rains, or when they shed their feathers, or when the weather is cold  and dreary, or when something doesn't please them, and cultivate their  voices only when they fall in love in the happy spring-time. But you  may hear the hardy, healthful song "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38253"],[0,"A Description of the Coasts of East Africa and Malabar in the Beginning of the (#13)"],[1,"ard, and is very apprehensive of the power of the  King of Portugal.[139] He shows great honour and attention to the  ships and people of Portugal who come to his port. The people of his  country are kept in very good order, and governed with much justice  and good treatment; he dispenses many favours and presents to  voyagers and strangers in his country.    A large fleet of the Great Sultan[140] of sailing ships and row  galleys arrived at this port, well equipped, with large crews and a  good armament; its captain was Emir Hussein. He came to reinforce  himself in this port with the assistance of the king of Cambay and  the before-mentioned governor Meliquiaz, and from thence to go to  Calicut, to fight with the Portuguese, and turn them out of India.  He was for some time in the port making many preparations, and the  Portuguese fleet came there to seek for them, of which Don Francisco  de Almeyda, viceroy of India, was the captain major. And the Moors  put out to sea to meet them, and the two fleets fought in the  entrance of this roadstead vigorously, and many people were killed  and wounded on both sides; and at the end the Moors were beaten and  captured with great slaughter, and the Portuguese took their ships  and galleys, with all their arms and heavy artillery. They captured  there many Moors, and the said Emir Hussein escaped, and left his  fleet to suffer as has been told; and when Meliquiaz, who assisted  and favoured them with his guard-boats and forces, saw the havoc, he  at once sent messengers to the before-mentioned viceroy to seek  peace of him, and he sent many provisions and refreshments and other  presents as a sign of peace.[141]      GOGARI.    Further on after this the coast begins to make a bend into Cambay  towards the north, in which bend are several seaports of the same  king, and towns of great trade. One of these is Guogari, at a  distance of twenty-five leagues (from Diu), which is a very large  town and a good port, where they always load many ships from Malabar  and other parts of India; and many other ships bound for Mekkah and  Aden. At this place all sorts of merchandise are dealt in, as at  Diu.      BARBESY.    Another is called Barbesy, a seaport twelve leagues further on to  the north, in which stretch of coast are several seaports of the  King of Cambay. All sorts of goods are traded in for all parts, and  the dues upon them produce very much to the king, who has in each of  these two places his custom houses, and all are well supplied with  provisions.      BUENDARI.    Further on, to north-west by north, there is another place in the  mouth of a small river which is called Guendari, twenty leagues  distant from Barbesy. And it is a very good town, a seaport of the  same trade, because further up that river is the great city of  Cambay. There arrived there many zambucos,[142] which are small  vessels of the Malabar country, with areca (nuts), spices, wax,  sugar, cardamums, emery, ivory, and elephants:[143] and these goods  are sold there very well. And from there they carry away cotton,  sesame, thread, wheat, peas, horses, alaquequas, and many other  goods. The navigation of these places is very dangerous, especially  for ships with keels which draw much water, because in this gulf  which the coast here makes, the ebb and flow is so great, that in a  very short space of time the sea leaves uncovered four or five  leagues of dry land, and in some places less; and it is expedient  for those who go in there to take country pilots, because, when the  tide runs down, they may know how to remain in pools of deep  water[144] such as there are there, and sometimes they make mistakes  and remain upon rocks, where they are lost.      CITY OF CAMBAY.    Entering this river of Guendari, to the north-east is the great city  of Cambay, inhabited by Moors and Gentiles. It is a very large city  of handsome houses of stone and whitewash, very lofty, with windows,  and covered with roofs in the Spanish fashion; it has very good  streets and squares, and is situated in a rich, fertile, and pretty  country, full of abundant provisions. There are in it rich merchants  and men of great property, both Moors and Gentiles; and there are  many workmen and mechanicians of subtle workmanship of all sorts,  after the fashion of Flanders, and all very cheap. They make there  many cloths of white cotton, fine and coarse, and other woven and  coloured fabrics of all kinds; also many silk fabrics, of all kinds  and colours; and camlets of silk and velvets of all colours, both  smooth and fluffy, coloured tafetans, and thick alcatifas. The  inhabitants of this city are all white, both men and women, and  there are many people from outside living in it who are very white  and very well dressed, and of luxurious lives, much given to  pleasure and amusement. They are very much accustomed to wash  themselves; they eat very well, and always go perfumed and anointed  with sweet smelling things. They wear in their hair, both men and  women, many jessamine and other flowers that grow amongst them. They  have many musicians, and various kinds of instruments and songs.  There are always carts with oxen and horses going about the city, of  which they make use for everything; and they go in these with rich  mattrasses, shut up and well fitted up with their windows, after the  manner of cabins; furnished and ornamented with silk stuffs, and the  seats within with cushions and pillows of silk and stamped kid  skins:[145] and with their waggoners. Men and women go in these to  see amusements and diversions, or to visit their friends, or  wherever they wish, without being known, and they see all that they  wish. And they go singing and playing on instruments in these same  waggons for their amusement. And these people possess many orchards  and gardens, where they go to take their ease, and where they grow  much fruit and vegetables for the sustenance of the gentiles, who do  not eat meat nor flesh. In this city a very large quantity of ivory  is employed in very delicate works, well known in commerce, like  inlaid works of gold, and things made by turning, and handles of  knives and daggers, bracelets, games of chess and chess-boards.  There are also great artists with the turning lathe, who make large  bedsteads, and they make beads of great size, brown, yellow, blue  and coloured, which they export to all parts. There are also great  lapidaries, and imitators of precious stones of all kinds, and  makers of false pearls which seem real. So also there are very good  silversmiths of very skilful workmanship. In this city they make  very delicate cushions, and pretty ceilings (or canopies) of  bedsteads, of delicate workmanship and paintings, and quilted  clothes for wearing. There are many Moorish women who produce very  delicate needlework. They work there too in coral alaquequas and  other stones.      LIMADURA.    Leaving this city of Cambay there is a town inland called Limadura,  where there is a stone with which they make aquequas, for making  beads for Berberia. It is a stone white as milk, and has some red in  it, and with fire they heighten the colour, and they extract it in  large blocks. In these places there are great artists who  manufacture and pierce these beads in various fashions, oval,  octagonal, round, and of other shapes; and with this stone they make  rings, buttons, and knife handles. And the Cambay merchants go there  to buy them, and they harden[146] them to take them away to sell in  the Red Sea, from whence they are in the habit of arriving in our  parts by way of Cairo or Alexandria: and they also carry them  throughout all Arabia, Persia, and Nubia, and now they take them to  India, because our people buy them. They also find in this town much  chalcedony, which they call _babagore_. They make beads with it, and  other things which they wear about them, so that they touch the  skin, as they say that it is good for chastity. These stones are of  little value there, for there are many of them.      RAVEL.    Returning to the towns on the sea, and passing Gandar, to the east  there is a good river twenty leagues further along the coast, and on  this side of it there is a good town of the Moors, called  Ravel,[147] built of very pretty houses and squares. It is a rich  and agreeable place, because the Moors of this town trade with their  ships at Malacca, Bengal, Tarvasery, Pegu, Martaban, and Samatara,  in all sorts of spices, drugs, silks, musk, benzoin, porcelain, and  all other valuable merchandise. They possess very large and fine  ships, so that those who would wish to get Chinese articles, will  find them there more completely than in any other part, and at very  fair prices.    The Moors of this place are white and well dressed, and very rich.  They have very pretty wives, and in the furniture[148] of their  houses they have many china vases of different shapes, and they keep  them in glass cupboards very well arranged. These women are not  secluded like those of other Moors and other places, but go about  the city in the daytime attending to their business, with the face  uncovered as in our parts.      SURATI.    Having passed this river of Ravel, at twenty leagues to the south is  a city called Surat, at the mouth of a river. This also is a city of  very great trade, in all classes of merchandise. Many ships of  Malabar and all other parts sail thither continually, and discharge  and take in goods, because this is a very important seaport, and  there are in it very vast quantities of merchandise. Moors,  Gentiles, and all sorts of people live in this city. Its  custom-house, which they call the Divana,[149] produces a very large  revenue for the King of Guzarat: and until now Malaguioy, a Gentile,  commands in, and governs it, as lord of it. And he is the greatest  nobleman in all India, and he gave orders to kill the King of  Guzerat for some gossip which they reported"]]]
