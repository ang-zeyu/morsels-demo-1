'tis ten times worse,  _London_ is a milder Curse.          _The Duke of_ ORMOND'S _March._    _Set by Mr._ CHURCH.      [Music]          Ye brave Boys and Tars,        That design for the Wars,  Remember the Action at _Vigo_;        And where ORMOND Commands,        Let us all joyn our Hands,  _And where he goes, may you go, and I go_.          Let Conquest and Fame,        The Honour proclaim,  Great ORMOND has gotten at _Vigo_;        Let the Trumpets now sound,        And the Ecchoes around,  _Where he goes, may you go, and I go_.          Let the Glories be Sung,        Which the ORMONDS have won,  Long before this great Action at _Vigo_;        They're so Loyal and Just,        And so true to their Trust,  _That where he goes, may you go, and I go_.          Old Records of Fame,        Of the ORMONDS great Name,  Their Actions, like these were of _Vigo_;        And since this Prince exceeds,        In his Fore-Father's Deeds,  _Then where he goes, may you go, and I go_.          'Tis the Praise of our Crown,        That such Men of Renown,  Shou'd lead on the Van, as at _Vigo_;        Where such Lives and Estates        Are expos'd for our sakes,  _Then where he goes, may you go, and I go_.          'Twas the whole Nation's Voice,        And we all did rejoyce,  When we heard he Commanded for _Vigo_;        To ANNA so True,        All her Foes to pursue,  _Then where he goes, may you go, and I go_.          'Tis the Voice of the Town,        And our Zeal for the Crown,  To serve ORMOND to _France_, _Spain_, or _Vigo_;        So Noble and brave,        Both to Conquer and save,  _Then where he goes, may you go, and I go_.          To the Soldiers so kind,        And so humbly inclin'd,  To wave his Applause gain'd at _Vigo_;        Yet so kind and so true,        He gave all Men their due,  _Then where he goes, may you go, and I go_.          We justly do own,        All the Honour that's won,  In _Flanders_, as well as at _Vigo_;        But our Subject and Theme,        Is of ORMOND's great Name,  _And where he goes, may you go, and I go_.          Then take off the Bowl,        To that Generous Soul,  That Commanded so bravely at _Vigo_;        And may ANNA approve,        Of our Duty and Love,  _And where he goes, may you go, and I go_.          _A Cure for Melancholy._      [Music]    Are you grown so Melancholy,  That you think on nought but Folly;          Are you sad,          Are you Mad,        Are you worse;          Do you think,          Want of Chink        Is a Curse:  Do you wish for to have,  Longer Life, or a Grave,    _Thus would I Cure ye_.    First I would have a Bag of Gold,  That should ten Thousand Pieces hold,          And all that,          In thy Hat,        Would I pour;          For to spend,          On thy Friend,        Or thy Whore:  For to cast away at Dice,  Or to shift you of your Lice,    _Thus would I Cure ye_.    Next I would have a soft Bed made,  Wherein a Virgin should be laid;          That would Play,          Any way        You'll devise;          That would stick          Like a Tick,        To your Thighs,  That would bill like a Dove,  Lye beneath or above,    _Thus would I Cure ye_.    Next that same Bowl, where _Jove_ Divine,  Drank _Nectar_ in, I'd fill with Wine;          That whereas,          You should pause,        You should quaff;          Like a _Greek_,          Till your Cheek,  To _Ceres_ and to _Venus_,  To _Bacchus_ and _Silenus_,    _Thus would I Cure ye_.    Last of all there should appear,  Seven Eunuchs sphere-like Singing here,          In the Praise,          Of those Ways,        Of delights;          _Venus_ can,          Use with Man,        In the Night;  When he strives to adorn,  _Vulcan's_ Head with a HORN,    _Thus would I Cure ye_.    But if not Gold, nor Woman can,  Nor Wine, nor Songs, make merry then;          Let the Batt,          Be thy Mate,        And the Owl;          Let a Pain,          In thy Brain,        Make thee Howl;  Let the Pox be thy Friend,  And the Plague work thy end,    _Thus I would Cure you_.          _To his fairest_ VALENTINE _Mrs._ A.L.      [Music]    Come pretty Birds present your Lays,  And learn to chaunt a Goddess Praise;  Ye Wood-Nymphs let your Voices be,  Employ'd to serve her Deity:  And warble forth, ye Virgins Nine,    _Some Musick to my_ Valentine.    Her Bosom is Loves Paradise,  There is no Heav'n but in her Eyes;  She's chaster than the Turtle-Dove,  And fairer than the Queen of Love;  Yea, all Perfections do combine,  To beautifie my Valentine.    She's Nature's choicest Cabinet,  Where Honour, Beauty, Worth and Wit,  Are all united in her Breast,  The Graces claim an Interest:  All Vertues that are most Divine,  Shine clearest in my Valentine.          _A_ BALLAD,    _Or_, COLLIN'S _Adventure._      [Music]    As _Collin_ went from his Sheep to unfold,  In a Morning of _April_, as grey as 'twas cold,  In a Thicket he heard a Voice it self spread;      Which was, O, O, _I am almost dead_.    He peep'd in the Bushes, and spy'd where there lay  His Mistress, whose Countenance made _April May_;  But in her looks some sadness was read,      Crying O, O, _I am almost dead_.    He rush'd in to her, and cry'd what's the matter,  Ah! _Collin_, quoth she, why will you come at her,  Who by the false Swain, hath often been misled,      For which O, O, _I am almost dead_.    He turn'd her Milk-pail, and there down he sat,  His Hands stroak'd his Beard, on his Knee lay his Coat,  But, O, still _Mopsa_ cry'd, before ought was said,      _Collin_, O, O, _I am almost dead_.    No more, quoth stout _Collin_! I ever was true,  Thou gav'st me a Handkerchief all hemm'd with Blue:  A Pin-box I gave thee, and a Girdle so Red,      Yet still she cry'd, O, O, _I am almost dead_.    Delaying, quoth she, hath made me thus Ill,  For I never fear'd _Sarah_ that dwelt at the Mill,  Since in the Ev'ning late her Hogs thou hast fed,      For which, O, O, _I am almost dead_.    _Collin_ then chuck'd her under the Chin,  Cheer up for to love thee I never will lin,  Says she, I'll believe it when the Parson has read,      'Till then, O, O, _I am almost dead_.    Uds boars, quoth _Collin_, I'll new my shon,  And e'er the Week pass, by the Mass it shall be done:  You might have done this before, then she said,      But now, O, O, _I am almost dead_.    He gave her a twitch that quite turn'd her round,  And said, I'm the truest that e'er trod on Ground,  Come settle thy Milk-Pail fast on thy Head,      No more O, O, _I am almost dead_.    Why then I perceive thoul't not leave me in the Lurch,  I'll don my best Cloths and streight to the Church:  Jog on, merry _Collin_, jog on before,      For I Faith, I Faith, _I'll dye no more_.          _The_ Town-Rakes, _A_ SONG: _Set by Mr._ Daniel Purcell: _Sung by Mr._  EDWARDS.      [Music]    What Life can compare with the jolly Town Rakes,  When in his full swing of all Pleasure he takes?  At Noon he gets up for a wet and to Dine,  And Wings the swift Hours with Mirth, Musick, and Wine,  Then jogs to the Play-house and chats with the Masques,  And thence to the _Rose_ where he takes his three Flasks,  There great as a _Caesar_ he revels when drunk,  And scours all he meets as he reels, as he reels to his Punk,  And finds the dear Girl in his Arms when he wakes,  What Life can compare to the jolly Town-Rakes, the Jolly Town-Rakes.    He like the Great Turk has his favourite She,  But the Town's his _Seraglio_, and still he lives free;  Sometimes she's a Lady, but as he must range,  Black _Betty_, or Oyster _Moll_ serve for a Change:  As he varies his Sports his whole Life is a Feast,  He thinks him that is soberest is most like a Beast:  All Houses of Pleasure, breaks Windows and Doors,  Kicks Bullies and Cullies, then lies with their Whores:  Rare work for the Surgeon and Midwife he makes,  What Life can Compare with the jolly Town-Rakes.    Thus in _Covent-Garden_ he makes his Campaigns,  And no Coffee-House haunts but to settle his Brains;  He laughs at dry Mortals, and never does think,  Unless 'tis to get the best Wenches and Drink:  He dwells in a Tavern, and lives ev'ry where,  And improving his Hour, lives an age in a Year:  For as Life is uncertain, he loves to make haste,  And thus he lives longest because he lives fast:  Then leaps in the Dark, and his _Exit_ he makes,  What Death can compare with the jolly Town-Rakes.          _A_ SONG: _Set by Mr._ CLARKE.      [Music]    Young _Coridon_ and _Phillis_    Sate in a lovely Grove;  Contriving Crowns of Lillies,    Repeating Tales of Love:  _And something else, but what I dare not_, &c.    But as they were a Playing,    She oagled so the Swain;  It say'd her plainly saying,    Let's kiss to ease our Pain:  _And something else_, &c.    A thousand times he kiss'd her,    Laying her on the Green;  But as he farther press'd her,    Her pretty Leg was seen:  _And something else_, &c.    So many Beauties removing,    His Ardour still increas'd;  And greater Joys pursuing,    He wander'd o'er her Breast:  _And something else_, &c.    A last Effort she trying,    His Passion to withstand;  Cry'd, but it was faintly crying,    Pray take away your Hand:  _And something else_, &c.    Young _Coridon_ grown bolder,    The Minute would improve;  This is the Time he told her,    To shew you how I love;  _And something else_, &c.    The Nymph seem'd almost dying,    Dissolv'd in amorous Heat;  She kiss'd, and told him sighing,    My Dear your Love is great:  _And something else_, &c.    But _Phillis_ did recover    Much sooner than the Swain;  She blushing ask'd her Lover,    Shall we not Kiss again:  _And something else_, &c.    Thus Love his Revels keeping,    'Till Nature at a stand;  From talk they fell to Sleeping,    Holding each others Hand;  _And something else_, &c.          _The Amorous_ BARBER'S _Passion of Love for his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681"],[0,"Ten Years Later (#13)"],[1,"the wind in your teeth,  as it will be, you will never reach the vessels.\"    \"You refuse, then?\"    \"Assuredly I do; I would willingly risk and lose my life in an encounter  against men,\" he said, glancing at Bragelonne, \"but as to fighting with  oars against waves, I have no taste for that.\"    \"And for myself,\" said Manicamp, \"even were I to succeed in reaching the  ships, I should not be indifferent to the loss of the only good dress  which I have left,--salt water would spoil it.\"    \"You, then, refuse also?\" exclaimed De Guiche.    \"Decidedly I do; I beg you to understand that most distinctly.\"    \"But,\" exclaimed De Guiche, \"look, De Wardes--look, Manicamp--look  yonder, the princesses are looking at us from the poop of the admiral's  vessel.\"    \"An additional reason, my dear fellow, why we should not make ourselves  ridiculous by being drowned while they are looking on.\"    \"Is that your last word, Manicamp?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And then yours, De Wardes?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Then I go alone.\"    \"Not so,\" said Raoul, \"for I shall accompany you; I thought it was  understood I should do so.\"    The fact is, that Raoul, uninfluenced by devotion, measuring the risk  they run, saw how imminent the danger was, but he willingly allowed  himself to accept a peril which De Wardes had declined.    The boat was about to set off when De Guiche called to the pilot.  \"Stay,\" said he: \"we want two places in your boat;\" and wrapping five or  six pistoles in paper, he threw them from the quay into the boat.    \"It seems you are not afraid of salt water, young gentlemen.\"    \"We are afraid of nothing,\" replied De Guiche.    \"Come along, then.\"    The pilot approached the side of the boat, and the two young men, one  after the other, with equal vivacity, jumped into the boat. \"Courage, my  men,\" said De Guiche; \"I have twenty pistoles left in this purse, and as  soon as we reach the admiral's vessel they shall be yours.\" The sailors  bent themselves to their oars, and the boat bounded over the crest  of the waves. The interest taken in this hazardous expedition was  universal; the whole population of Le Havre hurried towards the jetties  and every look was directed towards the little bark; at one moment it  flew suspended on the crest of the foaming waves, then suddenly glided  downwards towards the bottom of a raging abyss, where it seemed utterly  lost. At the expiration of an hour's struggling with the waves, it  reached the spot where the admiral's vessel was anchored, and from the  side of which two boats had already been dispatched towards their aid.  Upon the quarter-deck of the flagship, sheltered by a canopy of velvet  and ermine, which was suspended by stout supports, Henriette, the queen  dowager, and the young princess--with the admiral, the Duke of Norfolk,  standing beside them--watched with alarm this slender bark, at one  moment tossed to the heavens, and the next buried beneath the waves, and  against whose dark sail the noble figures of the two French gentlemen  stood forth in relief like two luminous apparitions. The crew, leaning  against the bulwarks and clinging to the shrouds, cheered the courage  of the two daring young men, the skill of the pilot, and the strength of  the sailors. They were received at the side of the vessel by a shout of  triumph. The Duke of Norfolk, a handsome young man, from twenty-six  to twenty-eight years of age, advanced to meet them. De Guiche and  Bragelonne lightly mounted the ladder on the starboard side, and,  conducted by the Duke of Norfolk, who resumed his place near them, they  approached to offer their homage to the princess. Respect, and yet more,  a certain apprehension, for which he could not account, had hitherto  restrained the Comte de Guiche from looking at Madame attentively, who,  however, had observed him immediately, and had asked her mother, \"Is not  that Monsieur in the boat yonder?\" Madame Henriette, who knew Monsieur  better than her daughter did, smiled at the mistake her vanity had led  her into, and had answered, \"No; it is only M. de Guiche, his favorite.\"  The princess, at this reply, was constrained to check an instinctive  tenderness of feeling which the courage displayed by the count had  awakened. At the very moment the princess had put this question to  her mother, De Guiche had, at last, summoned courage to raise his eyes  towards her and could compare the original with the portrait he had so  lately seen. No sooner had he remarked her pale face, her eyes so full  of animation, her beautiful nut-brown hair, her expressive lips, and her  every gesture, which, while betokening royal descent, seemed to thank  and to encourage him at one and the same time, than he was, for a  moment, so overcome, that, had it not been for Raoul, on whose arm  he leant, he would have fallen. His friend's amazed look, and  the encouraging gesture of the queen, restored Guiche to his  self-possession. In a few words he explained his mission, explained  in what way he had become envoy of his royal highness; and saluted,  according to their rank and the reception they gave him, the admiral and  several of the English noblemen who were grouped around the princess.    Raoul was then presented, and was most graciously received; the share  that the Comte de la Fere had had in the restoration of Charles II. was  known to all; and, more than that, it was the comte who had been  charged with the negotiation of the marriage, by means of which the  granddaughter of Henry IV. was now returning to France. Raoul spoke  English perfectly, and constituted himself his friend's interpreter with  the young English noblemen, who were indifferently acquainted with the  French language. At this moment, a young man came forward, of extremely  handsome features, and whose dress and arms were remarkable for their  extravagance of material. He approached the princesses, who were engaged  in conversation with the Duke of Norfolk, and, in a voice which ill  concealed his impatience, said, \"It is now time to disembark, your royal  highness.\" The younger of the princesses rose from her seat at this  remark, and was about to take the hand which the young nobleman extended  to her, with an eagerness which arose from a variety of motives, when  the admiral intervened between them, observing: \"A moment, if you  please, my lord; it is not possible for ladies to disembark just now,  the sea is too rough; it is probable the wind may abate before sunset,  and the landing will not be effected, therefore, until this evening.\"    \"Allow me to observe, my lord,\" said Buckingham, with an irritation of  manner which he did not seek to disguise, \"you detain these ladies,  and you have no right to do so. One of them, unhappily, now belongs to  France, and you perceive that France claims them by the voice of her  ambassadors;\" and at the same moment he indicated Raoul and Guiche, whom  he saluted.    \"I cannot suppose that these gentlemen intend to expose the lives of  their royal highnesses,\" replied the admiral.    \"These gentlemen,\" retorted Buckingham, \"arrived here safely,  notwithstanding the wind; allow me to believe that the danger will not  be greater for their royal highnesses when the wind will be in their  favor.\"    \"These envoys have shown how great their courage is,\" said the admiral.  \"You may have observed that there was a great number of persons on shore  who did _not_ venture to accompany them. Moreover, the desire which they  had to show their respect with the least possible delay to Madame and  her illustrious mother, induced them to brave the sea, which is very  tempestuous to-day, even for sailors. These gentlemen, however, whom I  recommend as an example for my officers to follow, can hardly be so for  these ladies.\"    Madame glanced at the Comte de Guiche, and perceived that his face was  burning with confusion. This look had escaped Buckingham, who had eyes  for nothing but Norfolk, of whom he was evidently very jealous; he  seemed anxious to remove the princesses from the deck of a vessel where  the admiral reigned supreme. \"In that case,\" returned Buckingham, \"I  appeal to Madame herself.\"    \"And I, my lord,\" retorted the admiral, \"I appeal to my own conscience,  and to my own sense of responsibility. I have undertaken to convey  Madame safe and sound to France, and I shall keep my promise.\"    \"But, sir--\" continued Buckingham.    \"My lord, permit me to remind you that I command here.\"    \"Are you aware what you are saying, my lord?\" replied Buckingham,  haughtily.    \"Perfectly so; I therefore repeat it: I alone command here, all yield  obedience to me; the sea and the winds, the ships and men too.\" This  remark was made in a dignified and authoritative manner. Raoul observed  its effect upon Buckingham, who trembled with anger from head to foot,  and leaned against one of the poles of the tent to prevent himself  falling; his eyes became suffused with blood, and the hand which he did  not need for his support wandered towards the hilt of his sword.    \"My lord,\" said the queen, \"permit me to observe that I agree in every  particular with the Duke of Norfolk; if the heavens, instead of being  clouded as they are at the present moment, were perfectly serene and  propitious, we can still afford to bestow a few hours upon the officer  who has conducted us so successfully, and with such extreme attention,  to the French coast, where he is to take leave of us.\"    Buckingham, instead of replying, seemed to seek counsel from the  expression of Madame's face. She, however, half-concealed beneath the  thick curtains of the velvet and gold which sheltered her, had not  listened to the discussion, having been occupied in watching the Comte  de Guiche, who was conversing with Raoul. This was a fresh misfortune  for Buckingham, who fancied he perceived in Madame Henrietta's look a  deeper feeling than that of curiosity. He withdrew, almost tottering in  his gait, and nearly stumbled"]]]
