For similar reasons, names have not been given to the liquid or concrete  states of most of the aeriform fluids: These were not known to arise  from the combination of caloric with certain bases; and, as they had not  been seen either in the liquid or solid states, their existence, under  these forms, was even unknown to natural philosophers.    We have not pretended to make any alteration upon such terms as are  sanctified by ancient custom; and, therefore, continue to use the words  _water_ and _ice_ in their common acceptation: We likewise retain the  word _air_, to express that collection of elastic fluids which composes  our atmosphere; but we have not thought it necessary to preserve the  same respect for modern terms, adopted by latter philosophers, having  considered ourselves as at liberty to reject such as appeared liable to  occasion erroneous ideas of the substances they are meant to express,  and either to substitute new terms, or to employ the old ones, after  modifying them in such a manner as to convey more determinate ideas. New  words have been drawn, chiefly from the Greek language, in such a manner  as to make their etymology convey some idea of what was meant to be  represented; and these we have always endeavoured to make short, and of  such a nature as to be changeable into adjectives and verbs.    Following these principles, we have, after Mr Macquer's example,  retained the term _gas_, employed by Vanhelmont, having arranged the  numerous class of elastic aeriform fluids under that name, excepting  only atmospheric air. _Gas_, therefore, in our nomenclature, becomes a  generic term, expressing the fullest degree of saturation in any body  with caloric; being, in fact, a term expressive of a mode of existence.  To distinguish each species of gas, we employ a second term from the  name of the base, which, saturated with caloric, forms each particular  gas. Thus, we name water combined to saturation with caloric, so as to  form an elastic fluid, _aqueous gas_; ether, combined in the same  manner, _etherial gas_; the combination of alkohol with caloric, becomes  _alkoholic gas_; and, following the same principles, we have _muriatic  acid gas_, _ammoniacal gas_, and so on of every substance susceptible of  being combined with caloric, in such a manner as to assume the gasseous  or elastic aeriform state.    We have already seen, that the atmospheric air is composed of two  gasses, or aeriform fluids, one of which is capable, by respiration, of  contributing to animal life, and in which metals are calcinable, and  combustible bodies may burn; the other, on the contrary, is endowed with  directly opposite qualities; it cannot be breathed by animals, neither  will it admit of the combustion of inflammable bodies, nor of the  calcination of metals. We have given to the base of the former, or  respirable portion of the air, the name of _oxygen_, from [Greek: oxys]  _acidum_, and [Greek: geinomas], _gignor_; because, in reality, one of  the most general properties of this base is to form acids, by combining  with many different substances. The union of this base with caloric we  term _oxygen gas_, which is the same with what was formerly called  _pure_, or _vital air_. The weight of this gas, at the temperature of  10 deg. (54.50), and under a pressure equal to 28 inches of the barometer,  is half a grain for each cubical inch, or one ounce and a half to each  cubical foot.    The chemical properties of the noxious portion of atmospheric air being  hitherto but little known, we have been satisfied to derive the name of  its base from its known quality of killing such animals as are forced to  breathe it, giving it the name of _azote_, from the Greek privitive  particle [Greek: a] and [Greek: xae], vita; hence the name of the  noxious part of atmospheric air is _azotic gas_; the weight of which, in  the same temperature, and under the same pressure, is 1 oz. 2 gros  and 48 grs. to the cubical foot, or 0.4444 of a grain to the cubical  inch. We cannot deny that this name appears somewhat extraordinary; but  this must be the case with all new terms, which cannot be expected to  become familiar until they have been some time in use. We long  endeavoured to find a more proper designation without success; it was at  first proposed to call it _alkaligen gas_, as, from the experiments of  Mr Berthollet, it appears to enter into the composition of ammoniac, or  volatile alkali; but then, we have as yet no proof of its making one of  the constituent elements of the other alkalies; beside, it is proved to  compose a part of the nitric acid, which gives as good reason to have  called it _nitrigen_. For these reasons, finding it necessary to reject  any name upon systematic principles, we have considered that we run no  risk of mistake in adopting the terms of _azote_, and _azotic gas_,  which only express a matter of fact, or that property which it  possesses, of depriving such animals as breathe it of their lives.    I should anticipate subjects more properly reserved for the subsequent  chapters, were I in this place to enter upon the nomenclature of the  several species of gasses: It is sufficient, in this part of the work,  to establish the principles upon which their denominations are founded.  The principal merit of the nomenclature we have adopted is, that, when  once the simple elementary substance is distinguished by an appropriate  term, the names of all its compounds derive readily, and necessarily,  from this first denomination.    FOOTNOTES:    [10] In English, the word _steam_ is exclusively appropriated to water  in the state of vapour. E.          CHAP. V.    _Of the Decomposition of Oxygen Gas by Sulphur, Phosphorus, and  Charcoal--and of the Formation of Acids in general._      In performing experiments, it is a necessary principle, which ought  never to be deviated from, that they be simplified as much as possible,  and that every circumstance capable of rendering their results  complicated be carefully removed. Wherefore, in the experiments which  form the object of this chapter, we have never employed atmospheric air,  which is not a simple substance. It is true, that the azotic gas, which  forms a part of its mixture, appears to be merely passive during  combustion and calcination; but, besides that it retards these  operations very considerably, we are not certain but it may even alter  their results in some circumstances; for which reason, I have thought it  necessary to remove even this possible cause of doubt, by only making  use of pure oxygen gas in the following experiments, which show the  effects produced by combustion in that gas; and I shall advert to such  differences as take place in the results of these, when the oxygen gas,  or pure vital air, is mixed, in different proportions, with azotic gas.    Having filled a bell-glass (A. Pl. iv. fig. 3), of between five and six  pints measure, with oxygen gas, I removed it from the water trough,  where it was filled, into the quicksilver bath, by means of a shallow  glass dish slipped underneath, and having dried the mercury, I  introduced 61-1/4 grains of Kunkel's phosphorus in two little China  cups, like that represented at D, fig. 3. under the glass A; and that I  might set fire to each of the portions of phosphorus separately, and to  prevent the one from catching fire from the other, one of the dishes was  covered with a piece of flat glass. I next raised the quicksilver in the  bell-glass up to E F, by sucking out a sufficient portion of the gas by  means of the syphon G H I. After this, by means of the crooked iron wire  (fig. 16.), made red hot, I set fire to the two portions of phosphorus  successively, first burning that portion which was not covered with the  piece of glass. The combustion was extremely rapid, attended with a very  brilliant flame, and considerable disengagement of light and heat. In  consequence of the great heat induced, the gas was at first much  dilated, but soon after the mercury returned to its level, and a  considerable absorption of gas took place; at the same time, the whole  inside of the glass became covered with white light flakes of concrete  phosphoric acid.    At the beginning of the experiment, the quantity of oxygen gas, reduced,  as above directed, to a common standard, amounted to 162 cubical inches;  and, after the combustion was finished, only 23-1/4 cubical inches,  likewise reduced to the standard, remained; so that the quantity of  oxygen gas absorbed during the combustion was 138-3/4 cubical inches,  equal to 69.375 grains.    A part of the phosphorus remained unconsumed in the bottom of the cups,  which being washed on purpose to separate the acid, weighed about 16-1/4  grains; so that about 45 grains of phosphorus had been burned: But, as  it is hardly possible to avoid an error of one or two grains, I leave  the quantity so far qualified. Hence, as nearly 45 grains of phosphorus  had, in this experiment, united with 69.375 grains of oxygen, and as no  gravitating matter could have escaped through the glass, we have a right  to conclude, that the weight of the substance resulting from the  combustion in form of white flakes, must equal that of the phosphorus  and oxygen employed, which amounts to 114.375 grains. And we shall  presently find, that these flakes consisted entirely of a solid or  concrete acid. When we reduce these weights to hundredth parts, it will  be found, that 100 parts of phosphorus require 154 parts of oxygen for  saturation, and that this combination will produce 254 parts of concrete  phosphoric acid, in form of white fleecy flakes.    This experiment proves, in the most convincing manner, that, at a  certain degree of temperature, oxygen possesses a stronger"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308"],[0,"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) (#13)"],[1,"porch, the white lane winding  down the hill between tall rows of elms, the thatched-roof cottages  peeping above their trim-kept hedges, the silver river in the hollow, the  wooded hills beyond!    It was a lovely landscape.  It was idyllic, poetical, and it inspired me.  I felt good and noble.  I felt I didn't want to be sinful and wicked any  more.  I would come and live here, and never do any more wrong, and lead  a blameless, beautiful life, and have silver hair when I got old, and all  that sort of thing.    In that moment I forgave all my friends and relations for their  wickedness and cussedness, and I blessed them.  They did not know that I  blessed them.  They went their abandoned way all unconscious of what I,  far away in that peaceful village, was doing for them; but I did it, and  I wished that I could let them know that I had done it, because I wanted  to make them happy.  I was going on thinking away all these grand, tender  thoughts, when my reverie was broken in upon by a shrill piping voice  crying out:    \"All right, sur, I'm a-coming, I'm a-coming.  It's all right, sur; don't  you be in a hurry.\"    I looked up, and saw an old bald-headed man hobbling across the  churchyard towards me, carrying a huge bunch of keys in his hand that  shook and jingled at every step.    I motioned him away with silent dignity, but he still advanced,  screeching out the while:    \"I'm a-coming, sur, I'm a-coming.  I'm a little lame.  I ain't as spry as  I used to be.  This way, sur.\"    \"Go away, you miserable old man,\" I said.    \"I've come as soon as I could, sur,\" he replied.  \"My missis never see  you till just this minute.  You follow me, sur.\"    \"Go away,\" I repeated; \"leave me before I get over the wall, and slay  you.\"    He seemed surprised.    \"Don't you want to see the tombs?\" he said.    \"No,\" I answered, \"I don't.  I want to stop here, leaning up against this  gritty old wall.  Go away, and don't disturb me.  I am chock full of  beautiful and noble thoughts, and I want to stop like it, because it  feels nice and good.  Don't you come fooling about, making me mad,  chivying away all my better feelings with this silly tombstone nonsense  of yours.  Go away, and get somebody to bury you cheap, and I'll pay half  the expense.\"    He was bewildered for a moment.  He rubbed his eyes, and looked hard at  me.  I seemed human enough on the outside: he couldn't make it out.    He said:    \"Yuise a stranger in these parts?  You don't live here?\"    [Picture: Graves] \"No,\" I said, \"I don't.  _You_ wouldn't if _I_ did.\"    \"Well then,\" he said, \"you want to see the tombs--graves--folks been  buried, you know--coffins!\"    \"You are an untruther,\" I replied, getting roused; \"I do not want to see  tombs--not your tombs.  Why should I?  We have graves of our own, our  family has.  Why my uncle Podger has a tomb in Kensal Green Cemetery,  that is the pride of all that country-side; and my grandfather's vault at  Bow is capable of accommodating eight visitors, while my great-aunt Susan  has a brick grave in Finchley Churchyard, with a headstone with a  coffee-pot sort of thing in bas-relief upon it, and a six-inch best white  stone coping all the way round, that cost pounds.  When I want graves, it  is to those places that I go and revel.  I do not want other folk's.  When you yourself are buried, I will come and see yours.  That is all I  can do for you.\"    He burst into tears.  He said that one of the tombs had a bit of stone  upon the top of it that had been said by some to be probably part of the  remains of the figure of a man, and that another had some words, carved  upon it, that nobody had ever been able to decipher.    I still remained obdurate, and, in broken-hearted tones, he said:    \"Well, won't you come and see the memorial window?\"    I would not even see that, so he fired his last shot.  He drew near, and  whispered hoarsely:    \"I've got a couple of skulls down in the crypt,\" he said; \"come and see  those.  Oh, do come and see the skulls!  You are a young man out for a  holiday, and you want to enjoy yourself.  Come and see the skulls!\"    Then I turned and fled, and as I sped I heard him calling to me:    \"Oh, come and see the skulls; come back and see the skulls!\"    Harris, however, revels in tombs, and graves, and epitaphs, and  monumental inscriptions, and the thought of not seeing Mrs. Thomas's  grave made him crazy.  He said he had looked forward to seeing Mrs.  Thomas's grave from the first moment that the trip was proposed--said he  wouldn't have joined if it hadn't been for the idea of seeing Mrs.  Thomas's tomb.    I reminded him of George, and how we had to get the boat up to Shepperton  by five o'clock to meet him, and then he went for George.  Why was George  to fool about all day, and leave us to lug this lumbering old top-heavy  barge up and down the river by ourselves to meet him?  Why couldn't  George come and do some work?  Why couldn't he have got the day off, and  come down with us?  Bank be blowed!  What good was he at the bank?    \"I never see him doing any work there,\" continued Harris, \"whenever I go  in.  He sits behind a bit of glass all day, trying to look as if he was  doing something.  What's the good of a man behind a bit of glass?  I have  to work for my living.  Why can't he work?  What use is he there, and  what's the good of their banks?  They take your money, and then, when you  draw a cheque, they send it back smeared all over with 'No effects,'  'Refer to drawer.'  What's the good of that?  That's the sort of trick  they served me twice last week.  I'm not going to stand it much longer.  I shall withdraw my account.  If he was here, we could go and see that  tomb.  I don't believe he's at the bank at all.  He's larking about  somewhere, that's what he's doing, leaving us to do all the work.  I'm  going to get out, and have a drink.\"    I pointed out to him that we were miles away from a pub.; and then he  went on about the river, and what was the good of the river, and was  everyone who came on the river to die of thirst?    It is always best to let Harris have his head when he gets like this.  Then he pumps himself out, and is quiet afterwards.    I reminded him that there was concentrated lemonade in the hamper, and a  gallon-jar of water in the nose of the boat, and that the two only wanted  mixing to make a cool and refreshing beverage.    Then he flew off about lemonade, and \"such-like Sunday-school slops,\" as  he termed them, ginger-beer, raspberry syrup, &c., &c.  He said they all  produced dyspepsia, and ruined body and soul alike, and were the cause of  half the crime in England.    He said he must drink something, however, and climbed upon the seat, and  leant over to get the bottle.  It was right at the bottom of the hamper,  and seemed difficult to find, and he had to lean over further and  further, and, in trying to steer at the same time, from a topsy-turvy  point of view, he pulled the wrong line, and sent the boat into the bank,  and the shock upset him, and he dived down right into the hamper, and  stood there on his head, holding on to the sides of the boat like grim  death, his legs sticking up into the air.  He dared not move for fear of  going over, and had to stay there till I could get hold of his legs, and  haul him back, and that made him madder than ever.          CHAPTER VIII.

We stopped under the willows by Kempton Park, and lunched.  It is a  pretty little spot there: a pleasant grass plateau, running along by the  water's edge, and overhung by willows.  We had just commenced the third  course--the bread and jam--when a gentleman in shirt-sleeves and a short  pipe came along, and wanted to know if we knew that we were trespassing.  We said we hadn't given the matter sufficient consideration as yet to  enable us to arrive at a definite conclusion on that point, but that, if  he assured us on his word as a gentleman that we _were_ trespassing, we  would, without further hesitation, believe it.    He gave us the required assurance, and we thanked him, but he still hung  about, and seemed to be dissatisfied, so we asked him if there was  anything further that we could do for him; and Harris, who is of a chummy  disposition, offered him a bit of bread and jam.    I fancy he must have belonged to some society sworn to abstain from bread  and jam; for he declined it quite gruffly, as if he were vexed at being  tempted with it, and he added that it was his duty to turn us off.    Harris said that if it was a duty it ought to be done, and asked the man  what was his idea with regard to the best means for accomplishing it.  Harris is what you would call a well-made man of about number one size,  and looks hard and bony, and the man measured him up and down, and said  he would go and consult his master, and then come back and chuck us both  into the river.    Of course, we never saw him any more, and, of course, all he really  wanted was a shilling.  There are a certain number of riverside roughs  who make quite an income, during the summer, by slouching about the banks  and blackmailing weak-minded noodles in this way.  They represent  themselves as sent by the proprietor.  The proper course to pursue is to  offer your name and address, and leave the owner, if he really has  anything to do with the matter, to summon you, and prove what damage you  have done to his land by sitting down on a bit of it.  But the majority  of people are so intensely lazy and timid, that they prefer to encourage  the imposition by giving in to it rather than put an end to it by the  exertion of a little firmness.
