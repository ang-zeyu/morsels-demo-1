Fauvel.\"    This threat aroused Prosper from his torpor.    \"You shall do nothing of the kind!\" he cried with unrestrained  indignation.    \"I will do so before the sun goes down this day. M. Fauvel will grant me  time to pay the rest. My pension is fifteen hundred francs. I can live  upon five hundred, and am strong enough to go to work again; and your  brother-in-law--\"    M. Bertomy stopped short, frightened at the expression of his son's  face. His features were contracted with such furious rage that he was  scarcely recognizable, and his eyes glared like a maniac's.    \"You dare not disgrace me thus!\" he cried; \"you have no right to do it.  You are free to disbelieve me yourself, but you have no right for taking  a step that would be a confession of guilt, and ruin me forever. Who  and what convinces you of my guilt? When cold justice hesitates, you,  my father, hesitate not, but, more pitiless than the law, condemn me  unheard!\"    \"I only do my duty.\"    \"Which means that I stand on the edge of a precipice, and you push me  over. Do you call that your duty? What! between strangers who accuse me,  and myself who swear that I am innocent, you do not hesitate? Why? Is  it because I am your son? Our honor is at stake, it is true; but that is  only the more reason why you should sustain me, and assist me to defend  myself.\"    Prosper's earnest, truthful manner was enough to unsettle the firmest  convictions, and make doubt penetrate the most stubborn mind.    \"Yet,\" said M. Bertomy in a hesitating tone, \"everything seems to accuse  you.\"    \"Ah, father, you do not know that I was suddenly banished from  Madeleine's presence; that I was compelled to avoid her. I became  desperate, and tried to forget my sorrow in dissipation. I sought  oblivion, and found shame and disgust. Oh, Madeleine, Madeleine!\"    He was overcome with emotion; but in a few minutes he started up with  renewed violence in his voice and manner.    \"Everything is against me!\" he exclaimed, \"but no matter. I will justify  myself or perish in the attempt. Human justice is liable to error;  although innocent, I may be convicted: so be it. I will undergo my  penalty; but people are not kept galley-slaves forever.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"I mean, father, that I am now another man. My life, henceforth, has an  object, vengeance! I am the victim of a vile plot. As long as I have a  drop of blood in my veins, I will seek its author. And I will certainly  find him; and then bitterly shall he expiate all of my cruel suffering.  The blow came from the house of Fauvel, and I will live to prove it.\"    \"Take care: your anger makes you say things that you will repent  hereafter.\"    \"Yes, I see, you are going to descant upon the probity of M. Andre  Fauvel. You will tell me that all the virtues have taken refuge in the  bosom of this patriarchal family. What do you know about it? Would this  be the first instance in which the most shameful secrets are concealed  beneath the fairest appearances? Why did Madeleine suddenly forbid me to  think of her? Why has she exiled me, when she suffers as much from our  separation as I myself, when she still loves me? For she does love me. I  am sure of it. I have proofs of it.\"    The jailer came to say that the time allotted to M. Bertomy had expired,  and that he must leave the cell.    A thousand conflicting emotions seemed to rend the old man's heart.    Suppose Prosper were telling the truth: how great would be his remorse,  if he had added to his already great weight of sorrow and trouble! And  who could prove that he was not sincere?    The voice of this son, of whom he had always been so proud, had aroused  all his paternal affection, so violently repressed. Ah, were he guilty,  and guilty of a worse crime, still he was his son, his only son!    His countenance lost its severity, and his eyes filled with tears.    He had resolved to leave, as he had entered, stern and angry: he had  not the cruel courage. His heart was breaking. He opened his arms, and  pressed Prosper to his heart.    \"Oh, my son!\" he murmured. \"God grant you have spoken the truth!\"    Prosper was triumphant: he had almost convinced his father of his  innocence. But he had not time to rejoice over this victory.    The cell-door again opened, and the jailer's gruff voice once more  called out:    \"It is time for you to appear before the court.\"    He instantly obeyed the order.    But his step was no longer unsteady, as a few days previous: a complete  change had taken place within him. He walked with a firm step, head  erect, and the fire of resolution in his eye.    He knew the way now, and he walked a little ahead of the constable who  escorted him.    As he was passing through the room full of policemen, he met the man  with gold spectacles, who had watched him so intently the day he was  searched.    \"Courage, M. Prosper Bertomy,\" he said: \"if you are innocent, there are  those who will help you.\"    Prosper started with surprise, and was about to reply, when the man  disappeared.    \"Who is that gentleman?\" he asked of the policeman.    \"Is it possible that you don't know him?\" replied the policeman with  surprise. \"Why, it is M. Lecoq, of the police service.\"    \"You say his name is Lecoq?\"    \"You might as well say 'monsieur,'\" said the offended policeman; \"it  would not burn your mouth. M. Lecoq is a man who knows everything that  he wants to know, without its ever being told to him. If you had had  him, instead of that smooth-tongued imbecile Fanferlot, your case would  have been settled long ago. Nobody is allowed to waste time when he has  command. But he seems to be a friend of yours.\"    \"I never saw him until the first day I came here.\"    \"You can't swear to that, because no one can boast of knowing the  real face of M. Lecoq. It is one thing to-day, and another to-morrow;  sometimes he is a dark man, sometimes a fair one, sometimes quite young,  and then an octogenarian: why, not seldom he even deceives me. I begin  to talk to a stranger, paf! the first thing I know, it is M. Lecoq!  Anybody on the face of the earth might be he. If I were told that you  were he, I should say, 'It is very likely.' Ah! he can convert himself  into any shape and form he chooses. He is a wonderful man!\"    The constable would have continued forever his praises of M. Lecoq, had  not the sight of the judge's door put an end to them.    This time, Prosper was not kept waiting on the wooden bench: the judge,  on the contrary, was waiting for him.    M. Patrigent, who was a profound observer of human nature, had contrived  the interview between M. Bertomy and his son.    He was sure that between the father, a man of such stubborn honor, and  the son, accused of theft, an affecting scene would take place, and this  scene would completely unman Prosper, and make him confess.    He determined to send for him as soon as the interview was over, while  all his nerves were vibrating with terrible emotions: he would tell the  truth, to relieve his troubled, despairing mind.    His surprise was great to see the cashier's bearing; resolute without  obstinacy, firm and assured without defiance.    \"Well,\" he said, \"have you reflected?\"    \"Not being guilty, monsieur, I had nothing to reflect upon.\"    \"Ah, I see the prison has not been a good counsellor; you forget that  sincerity and repentance are the first things necessary to obtain the  indulgence of the law.\"    \"I crave no indulgence, monsieur.\"    M. Patrigent looked vexed, and said:    \"What would you say if I told you what had become of the three hundred  and fifty thousand francs?\"    Prosper shook his head sadly.    \"If it were known, monsieur, I would not be here, but at liberty.\"    This device had often been used by the judge, and generally succeeded;  but, with a man so thoroughly master of himself, there was small chance  of success. It had been used at a venture, and failed.    \"Then you persist in accusing M. Fauvel?\"    \"Him, or someone else.\"    \"Excuse me: no one else, since he alone knew the word. Had he any  interest in robbing himself?\"    \"I can think of none.\"    \"Well, now I will tell you what interest you had in robbing him.\"    M. Patrigent spoke as a man who was convinced of the facts he was about  to state; but his assurance was all assumed.    He had relied upon crushing, at a blow, a despairing wretched man, and  was nonplussed by seeing him appear as determined upon resistance.    \"Will you be good enough to tell me,\" he said, in a vexed tone, \"how  much you have spent during the last year?\"    Prosper did not find it necessary to stop to reflect and calculate.    \"Yes, monsieur,\" he answered, unhesitatingly: \"circumstances made it  necessary for me to preserve the greatest order in my wild career; I  spent about fifty thousand francs.\"    \"Where did you obtain them?\"    \"In the first place, twelve thousand francs were left to me by my  mother. I received from M. Fauvel fourteen thousand francs, as my  salary, and share of the profits. By speculating in stocks, I gained  eight thousand francs. The rest I borrowed, and intend repaying out of  the fifteen thousand francs which I have deposited in M. Fauvel's bank.\"    The account was clear, exact, and could be easily proved; it must be a  true one.    \"Who lent you the money?\"    \"M. Raoul de Lagors.\"    This witness had left Paris the day of the robbery, and could not be  found; so, for the time being, M. Patrigent was compelled to rely upon  Prosper's word.    \"Well,\" he said, \"I will not press this point; but tell me why, in spite  of the formal order of M. Fauvel, you drew the money from the Bank of  France the night before, instead of waiting till the morning of the  payment?\"    \"Because M. de Clameran had informed me that it would be agreeable,  necessary even, for him to have his money early in the morning.

THE OLD SQUAW, OR LONG-TAILED DUCK    (Clangula hyemalis)    The old squaw, or long-tailed duck, comes but little into California,  though a few are killed each year in Washington and Oregon. I killed  one several years ago as far south as Los Angeles county, California,  the only one I have ever known to get that far away from his northern  home.    =Color=--Male--As the winter plumage is the only garb that one of this  species will be seen in on these hunting grounds, I will only mention  it. Head, white, with a patch of brownish black on the side of the  head and side of the neck; breast, black, continuing over the back;  belly, white; wings, white; a band of yellow across the bill; central  tail feathers, black and very long.    Female--Head, white, with a dark patch on the top and on the side;  breast and back, smoky black; under parts, white; no long feathers in  the tail.        [Illustration: HARLEQUIN DUCK (Histrionicus histrionicus)]      THE HARLEQUIN DUCK    (Histrionicus histrionicus)    The harlequin duck is a northern bird that comes but little into the  United States on either coast. A few stragglers are met with in Oregon  and Washington, and an occasional one is killed in California. These  and the old squaw add a pleasing variety to our mounted collections,  but nothing to our sport.    =Color=--The accompanying illustration is the best description of this  duck that can be given, as the colors are white and a brownish black.  It is about the size of the widgeon.        [Illustration: WHITE-WINGED SCOTER (Oidemia deglandi)]      THE SCOTERS    (Oidemia deglandi--Oidemia americana)    The scoters, or coots, as they are called on the Atlantic coast, are  all found on this coast southward to Mexico. Of these the white-winged  scoter (=Oidemia deglandi=) is the most common, being found in large  numbers on all the bays and inlets of the coast as far south as the  Magdalena bay, Lower California.

THE GEESE OF THE PACIFIC COAST      The hunting grounds of the Pacific Coast have a greater variety of  geese than any other section of America. Here are to be found every  species known to the Eastern states, except the barnacle brant of the  Atlantic. But in return for the absence of this species of sea brant  we have the black sea brant, the white-cheeked goose, the ross goose,  the emperor goose (none of which are found east of the Rocky  Mountains) and the hutchins goose, the lesser snow goose, the  white-fronted goose and the little brown brant, which are only  stragglers east of the Mississippi valley, and only sparingly seen  that far east. Thus it will be seen that within the Pacific Coast  hunting grounds there are four genera and nine species of the goose  family. All of these are found in the northern parts of these hunting  grounds, but only about one-half of them visit the southern parts.  Increased areas of cultivation, the drainage of vast sections of  marshy lands and the absence of laws for their protection have greatly  reduced the once wonderful supply.    Acres of geese sounds fabulous, yet miles of geese is the only  expression which conveys an adequate idea of the wonderful numbers in  which these birds were seen on the Coast half a century ago. The great  majority of the geese of the Coast at that time were of the white  varieties, and it is a veritable fact that in California, and  especially in the Sacramento, San Joaquin and Los Angeles valleys,  these geese congregated during the winter months in such numbers as to  whiten the plains for miles. Many flocks of honkers were mixed with  them, as well as some of the other darker varieties. These darker  species of the family, however, were far more plentiful in the  northern parts of the State than in the southern. That part of the  Sacramento valley known as the Maine Prairies has always been a  favorite feeding place for the Canada goose and its subspecies.        [Illustration: CANADA GOOSE             BROWN BRANT                   (Branta canadensis)      (Branta minima)]      THE CANADA GOOSE, OR HONKER    (Branta canadensis)    The Canada goose, or honker as it is commonly called, was and is quite  common on the Coast. This goose, the largest of the Americans, has a  wide distribution, ranging from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from  the Arctic to Central America. They breed as far south as southern ern  Oregon, at any rate, and possibly on the higher mountain lakes as far  south as Mexico, for they seem to make their appearance on the Coast  shooting grounds of Mexico nearly, if not quite, as early as they do  here.    The flesh of the Canada goose is the equal if not the superior of the  tame goose. Its flight, except when migrating long distances, is  generally low, and in such cases it can be called by the hunter to  within shooting distance.    =Color=--Head and neck, black, with a white stripe running from the  chin back of the eye to near the top of the head; upper parts, dark  brownish gray; breast, dull, light gray, grading into white at the  abdomen; tail and wings, black. Both sexes alike.    =Eggs and Nest=--The nest is generally built of sticks and grass,  lined with feathers, and either in the marshes or on the banks of a  stream, and rarely if ever contain more than six or seven, and often  not more than four, eggs of a very light brownish white.    =Measurements=--Wing, about 19 inches; bill, about 1-3/4 inches.        [Illustration: WHITE-CHEEKED GOOSE (Branta canadensis occidentalis)]      THE WHITE-CHEEKED GOOSE    (Branta canadensis occidentalis)    The white-cheeked goose, known also as Mexican goose, is found only on  the Pacific Coast and never east of the Cascades in Washington and  Oregon, or the Sierra Nevadas in California. In fact, they are  generally confined to localities not far from the ocean. While both  the honker and the Hutchins goose have a white cheek, the white of the  honker meets under the chin or blends into a gray, but the white of  the white-cheeked variety is separated either with a distinct black  stripe under the chin or a mottled black and white one. Also the black  of the neck of the white-cheeked goose and the brownish gray of the  breast is very generally separated by a white collar, though sometimes  this is so faint as to be almost indistinguishable.    The white-cheeked goose is rarely seen south of Monterey Bay,  California.    =Color=--Same as the Canada goose, except that the white on the cheeks  is either separated under the chin by a black stripe or by only a very  few white feathers in the black.
