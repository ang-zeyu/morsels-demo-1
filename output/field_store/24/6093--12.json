This  category includes not only foreign currency and gold, but also a  country's holdings of Special Drawing Rights in the International  Monetary Fund, and its reserve position in the Fund.    Roadways:  This entry gives the total length of the road network and  includes the length of the paved and unpaved portions.    School life expectancy (primary to tertiary):  School life expectancy  (SLE) is the total number of years of schooling (primary to tertiary)  that a child can expect to receive, assuming that the probability of  his or her being enrolled in school at any particular future age is  equal to the current enrollment ratio at that age. Caution must be  maintained when utilizing this indicator in international comparisons.  For example, a year or grade completed in one country is not  necessarily the same in terms of educational content or quality as a  year or grade completed in another country. SLE represents the expected  number of years of schooling that will be completed, including years  spent repeating one or more grades.    Sex ratio:  This entry includes the number of males for each female in  five age groups - at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and  over, and for the total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently  emerged as an indicator of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some  countries. For instance, high sex ratios at birth in some Asian  countries are now attributed to sex-selective abortion and infanticide  due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect future marriage  patterns and fertility patterns. Eventually, it could cause unrest  among young adult males who are unable to find partners.    Stock of direct foreign investment - abroad:  This entry gives the  cumulative US dollar value of all investments in foreign countries made  directly by residents - primarily companies - of the home country, as  of the end of the time period indicated. Direct investment excludes  investment through purchase of shares.    Stock of direct foreign investment - at home:  This entry gives the  cumulative US dollar value of all investments in the home country made  directly by residents - primarily companies - of other countries as of  the end of the time period indicated. Direct investment excludes  investment through purchase of shares.    Stock of domestic credit:  This entry is the total quantity of credit,  denominated in the domestic currency, provided by banks to nonbanking  institutions. The national currency units have been converted to US  dollars at the closing exchange rate on the date of the information.    Stock of money:  This entry, also known as \"M1,\" comprises the total  quantity of currency in circulation (notes and coins) plus demand  deposits denominated in the national currency, held by nonbank  financial institutions, state and local governments, nonfinancial  public enterprises, and the private sector of the economy. The national  currency units have been converted to US dollars at the closing  exchange rate on the date of the information.    Stock of quasi money:  This entry comprises the total quantity of time  and savings deposits denominated in the national currency, held by  nonbank financial institutions, state and local governments,  nonfinancial public enterprises, and the private sector of the economy.  When added together with \"M1\" the total money supply is known as \"M2.\"  The national currency units have been converted to US dollars at the  closing exchange rate on the date of the information.    Suffrage:  This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the  right to vote is universal or restricted.    Telephone numbers:  All telephone numbers in The World Factbook consist  of the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where required)  in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that is not  presented is the international access code, which varies from country  to country. For example, an international direct dial telephone call  placed from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows: 011 [34] (1)  577-xxxx, where 011 is the international access code for station-to-  station calls; 01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls,  [34] is the country code for Spain, (1) is the city code for Madrid,  577 is the local exchange, and xxxx is the local telephone number. An  international direct dial telephone call placed from another country to  the US would be as follows: international access code + [1] (202) 939-  xxxx, where [ 1] is the country code for the US, (202) is the area code  for Washington, DC, 939 is the local exchange, and xxxx is the local  telephone number.

And more than this, since the period of  sentimentalism will be seen as more extensive, and as the works of  Richardson, Rousseau (of course only those which belong in this  category), and of Madame de Stael and others, will be included in it,  then we say that the better productions of our authoress will carry off  the prize from all the rest.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Two collections of songs, national and lyric, have made their appearance  in Germany. The one is by GEORGE SCHERER, and is called _Deutsche  Volkshelier_, the other, by WOLFGAND MENZEL, is entitled _Die Gesange  der Volker_ (The Songs of the Nations). The former is exclusively  German; the latter contains songs from every civilized tongue under  heaven, as well as from many of the uncivilized, in German versions, of  course. Both are elegantly printed, and highly commended by the knowing  in that line of literature.           *       *       *       *       *    HENRI MURGER has published a companion volume to his _Scenes de la  Boheme_ in the shape of some stories called _Scenes de la Vie de  Jeunesse_.           *       *       *       *       *    A curious specimen of what may be done by a ready writer who is  scrupulous only about getting his pay, is afforded by a book just  published at Leipzic, called _Zahme Geschichten aus wilder Zeit_ (Tame  Stories of a Wild Time), by Frederick Ebeling. In these \"tame stories\"  the heroes of the late revolutionary movements are held up now in one  light, and now in another, with the most striking disregard of  consistency. Jellachich, for instance, is lauded in one place as the  most genial and charming of men, a scholar and gentleman, without equal,  and almost in the next page he is called a ferocious butcher, who never  wearies of slaughtering human beings. These discrepancies are accounted  for by the fact that Mr. Ebeling wrote for both conservative and radical  journals, and adapted his opinions to the wants of the market he was  serving. He would have done well to reconcile his articles with each  other before putting them into a book.           *       *       *       *       *    A valuable work on national law is entitled _Du Droits et des Devoirs  des Nations Neutres en Temps de Guerre Maritime_, by M. L. B.  Hautefeuille, a distinguished French jurist, lately published at Paris  in four octavos. It is praised by no less an authority than the eminent  advocate M. Chaix d'Est Ange, as the fruit of mature and conscientious  study: he calls it the most complete and one of the best works on modern  national law ever produced. The author in the historical part of his  treatise, criticises the monopolizing spirit and policy of the English  without mercy, and insists that the balance of power on the sea is of no  less importance than that on land. He would have established a permanent  alliance of armed neutrality, with France and the United States at its  head, to maintain the maritime rights of weaker states in time of war,  against the encroachments of British commerce and ambition.           *       *       *       *       *    A Vienna publishing establishment has offered GRILLPARZER, the German  dramatist, $4,000 for his writings, but he refuses, not because he  thinks the price too low, but because he will not take the trouble of  preparing and publishing a collected edition of his dramas, the last of  which was entitled _Maximilian Robespierre_, a five act tragedy. He has  also a variety of unpublished manuscripts, which it is feared will never  see the light.           *       *       *       *       *    Students and amateurs of music will find their account in taking the  _Rheinische Musikzeitung_ (Rhine Musical Gazette), published at Cologne,  under the editorial care of Prof. Bisehof. Its criticism is impartial,  intelligent, and free from the prejudices of the schools. German musical  criticism has no better organ.           *       *       *       *       *    The German poet SIMROCK has just published a new version of the two  Eddas, with the mythical narratives of the Skalda, which is spoken of as  a valuable contribution to literature.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries_ held its annual session on  the 15th February at the palace of Christianbourg, the King of Denmark  presiding. Mr. RAFN read the report of the transactions of the Society  during the year, and laid before the meeting a new number of the Annals  of the archaeology and history of the North, and the completed volume of  the Archaeological Journal, published by the Society. He also announced  that the second volume of his own work on Russian Antiquities was in  preparation, and that about half of it was already printed. To give an  idea of this work, he read from it a biographical notice on Biorucon, of  Arngeirr, an Icelander by birth, distinguished alike as a warrior and a  poet, and by his exploits in Russia where he served Vladimir the Great.  After this, other members of the Society gave interesting accounts of  the results of their various labors during the year. The King presented  a paper on excavations made under his personal direction in the ruins of  the castles of Saborg and Adserbo, in the North of Seland. These castles  date from the middle ages; the memoir was accompanied by drawings.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Historisches Tashcenbuch_ (Historical Pocket-Book), edited by the  learned Prussian Raumer is a publication eminently worthy of notice. The  number for the year 1851 opens with biographical sketches of three  women, Ines de Castro and Maria and Lenora Telley, who played important  parts in Spanish and Portuguese history in the XIVth Century. They are  followed by a concise history of the German marine by Bartholdy, twelve  letters by John Voigt on the manners and social life of the princes at  the German Diets, a picture from the XVIth Century, the sequel of a  memoir by Guhrauer on Elizabeth, Abbess of Herford, a friend of William  Penn, and a correspondent of Malebranche, Leibnitz and Descartes, &c.,  &c. &c.           *       *       *       *       *    An interesting account of a most eventful period and country is the  _Bilder aus Oestreich_, just published at Leipzic, by a German  traveller. The traveller is understood to be one of the editors of the  _Grenzboten_, and the period he describes comprises the revolutionary  years 1848-9. His account of Vienna in the memorable October days of  1848, is graphic, and even thrilling.           *       *       *       *       *    COTTA, of Stuttgart, has just published a new collection of poems by  FRANZ DINGELSTEDT, under the title of \"Night and Morning.\" The themes  are drawn from the revolution, its hopes and its disappointments.           *       *       *       *       *    FREDERIC LOUIS JAHN, the celebrated German professor, who invented the  modern system of gymnastics, is writing his personal memoirs. He is  about seventy years of age, and his long life has been full of  significant incidents.    To those who seek a good acquaintance with the current belles-lettres  literature of Germany, we can cordially recommend the _Deutsches  Museum_, published semi-monthly at Leipsic, under the editorial care of  Professor Robert Prutz and Wilhelm Wolffson, and sold in this city by  Westermann, 290 Broadway. Each number contains eighty-five close pages,  filled by some of the leading writers of German science, art and  politics. In the number now before us, are articles by Gutzkow, Boech,  the philologist, Berthold Auerbach, Emanuel Geibel and Julius Mosen. The  entire range of politics, philosophy, antiquities, art, poetry, romances  and literary criticism is included in the scope of the _Museum_, except  that it is designed not for the learned world, but for the mass of the  people, and accordingly aims at general not technical instruction. Among  the art notices, we observe a brief criticism on the Gallery of  Illustrious Americans, in which the lithography of the pictures is  praised as well as the faces themselves. The critic is delighted with  the energy, originality and freshness of character expressed in their  features.           *       *       *       *       *    A valuable contribution to current political history is the  _Verfassungskampf in Kurhessen_ (Constitutional Struggle in Electoral  Hesse), by Dr. H. Graefe, which has just made its appearance in Germany.  The conflict of the people and parliament and public officers, against  the selfish, arbitrary and foolish Elector, is the turning point of  recent German politics, and the defeat of the former after their  patience and firmness, acting always within the limits of the  constitution, had gained a decided victory, and compelled the faithless  prince to fly the country,--a defeat accomplished only by the  intervention of Austrian and Prussian troops, was the final downfall of  every form of political liberty in Germany. Dr. Graefe has wisely  abstained from treating the events of this crisis as a philosophical  historian; they are too fresh, and his own share in them was too decided  to allow him to undertake that successfully. He accordingly does little  more than simply report the transactions in a compendious way, with all  the documents necessary to a full understanding of the subject. Whoever  wishes for a thorough apprehension of the German tragi-comedy, may  derive aid from his work.           *       *       *       *       *    The resources of philology have just been enriched by the publication at  Tubingen of a dictionary of six of the dialects of Eastern Africa,  namely, the Kisuaheli, Kinika, Kikamba,"]]]
