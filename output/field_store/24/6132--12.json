[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32023"],[0,"The Boy's Voice (#13)"],[1," or MS., were placed. These desks stood on  either side of the piano, so that the boys looked towards Dr.  Longhurst. Not many voice exercises are used, nor is there any talk  about the registers. Pure tone is required, and the boys have not \"to  reason why.\" Six or seven of the youngest boys took no part in the  practice of the service music. When the elder boys had done, the younger  came forward and sang some solfeggio exercises. As a help in keeping  time the boys clapped their hands sometimes at the first of the bar, and  beat the pulses of the music. In the single voice parts, with long  rests, this is a help. The boys do not sing any secular music. At one  time they did, but now, with the schooling, the ordinary practices, and  the violin lessons, there is no time. Flattening does not often occur.  As a rule, when they intone on G, the G remains to the end. The practice  of singing the service unaccompanied on Fridays all the year round, and  on Wednesdays in addition during Lent, must have a bracing effect on the  choir. I was myself present on a Wednesday in Lent, and could detect no  falling in pitch. The boys at Canterbury do not appear to receive much  formal voice-training, and I attribute the excellent quality of their  singing to two facts. First, Dr. Longhurst has evidently a knack of  discerning a promising voice; and second, having established a tradition  of good singing, the boys, entering at an early age, insensibly fall  into it.      DR. BUCK'S BOYS AT NORWICH.    I have gathered from Mr. A. R. Gaul, Mus.B., of Birmingham, some  particulars of the work of Dr. Buck, organist of Norwich Cathedral, who  was known forty or fifty years ago all over the country as a trainer of  boys' voices. Mr. Gaul was a boy at Norwich under Dr. Buck, and  underwent the Spartan training which produced such notable results. \"No  chest voice above F or G\" was his rule, and the flute-like voice, which  goes by so many names, and is yet so unmistakable when heard, was  developed in all the choristers. Dr. Buck had an endless number of  contrivances for teaching his boys right ways. Each of them carried  about him a pocket looking-glass, and at practice was taught to hold it  in his hand, and watch his mouth as he sang. One finger on top of the  other was the gauge for opening the mouth transversely, while nuts were  held in the cheeks to secure its proper longitudinal opening. To look at  the boys during this exercise, one might think they had the face-ache!  However, no joking over these matters was allowed; there was a penny  fine for forgetting the looking-glass once, and a twopenny fine for  forgetting it a second time. To prevent the use of too much breath in  singing, Dr. Buck would take a piece of tissue paper, the size of a  postage stamp, hang it by a fine thread in front of the mouth, and make  the boys sing to it without blowing it away. Tongue-drill consisted in  regular motions of the unruly member, until the boys were able to make  it lie flat down at the bottom of the mouth, and raise it to the upper  teeth as required. It was a daily plan to practise certain passages with  the lips entirely closed, this was done to prevent the objectionable  quality of voice resulting from any stoppage of the nasal organs. There  was no sol-faing; various words were used at scale-practice, chosen to  develop the vowels, while a code of troublesome words and endings of  words was drawn up, and repeated daily by the boys in the  speaking-voice, so as to secure clear enunciation. I have more than once  seen and heard it stated that Dr. Buck used to make his boys sing  through the nose, with closed mouth, in order to get the higher  register, but Mr. Gaul does not remember this. Dr. Haydn Keeton informs  me that they had boy-altos at Norwich in Dr. Buck's time, so that he  must have had more boys than usual to train.      SALISBURY.    A conversation with Mr. C. L. South, the organist and choirmaster, shows  him to be a careful and able worker. The boys, who are boarded in the  choir school, come from various parts. They are received at from 8 to 11  years; not over 11 unless the boy is very good and forward in music. The  boys are chosen for their voices, but given two boys of equal voices,  the one who knows most music would be selected. The music practice is an  hour a day for five days of the week, under Mr. South himself. \"I  recognise,\" he says, \"two registers in boys' voices, chest and head, and  with careful practice you can get the voices so even that you can hardly  tell where one ends and the other begins. The great thing, I believe, is  to make the boys sing softly, and to get their register even  throughout.\" Mr. South adds that the imitative power of boys is so  strong that the younger ones fall into the habits of the elder ones, and  thus make formal teaching about the registers less necessary. For vocal  practice he uses Stainer's and Concone's Exercises, also solos like  \"Jesus, Saviour, I am Thine,\" and \"Let the Saviour's outstretched arm\"  (both from Bach's _Passion_), as well as Handel's \"Rejoice greatly,\"  besides florid choruses from the _Messiah_. These are more interesting  than formal studies, and they bring out the same points of breathing,  phrasing, pronunciation, and expression. He sometimes introduces a song  of this kind into the service as an anthem. On one occasion, when  thirteen boys had sung one of the Bach songs in unison, a member of the  congregation asked the name of the soloist. The voices were so perfectly  blended that they sounded like one. The full number of boys is eighteen,  of whom two at least sing solos. Mr. South does not use nor like boy  altos. The service music is selected on eclectic principles, and covers  the ground from Gibbons to Villiers Stanford. The boys sometimes give  concerts, performing such cantatas as Smart's _King Rene's Daughter_,  and Mendelssohn's \"Two-part Songs.\"    [Illustration: Decoration]          CHAPTER XII.    NOTES ON THE PRACTICE OF VARIOUS CHOIRMASTERS IN PARISH CHURCHES.      In the course of journeys and interviews extending over many years I  have gathered much experience from choirmasters, and have watched and  noted their plans. Here follow some of the results of this work. The  churches described are some of them small, and but little known. This  fact, however, does not affect the value of the experience. The highest  degree of credit is due to the choirmaster who obtains good results from  poor materials, and this book is especially intended to help those who  have to make the best of ordinary opportunities.      LEEDS PARISH CHURCH.    This church has long been noted for its music, which is sung in  cathedral style. There are about thirty boys, whose voices, even up to  A, are round and clear, and throughout are big, true, and rich. Notable  features of the style of the choir under Dr. Creser, are the long _dim_.  cadences in responses, and the independence which enables the singers to  go on without the organ, if the expression suggests it. At the rehearsal  in the parochial room Dr. Creser sits at the grand piano with the boys  in their cantoris and decani places on each side of him just as in  church. The boys rehearse five days a week after evensong, and the  juniors have an additional practice. After Saturday evensong there is a  full practice with the men. All the boys are trebles. Yorkshire is about  the only district in England which produces adult male altos. The boys  are chiefly promoted from district churches. They live at their homes,  and receive a free education--the seniors in the Leeds middle-class  school, and the juniors in the parish church school. There is also a  small salary paid quarterly, and when a boy leaves he receives from L15  to L25 if an ordinary chorister, and L50 if a good solo boy. Fines are  imposed by the precentor for misbehaviour or mischievous tricks in  church or precincts, but not for mistakes in singing. Dr. Creser teaches  sight-singing on the lines of Curwen's \"How to Read Music.\" The boys use  the old notation, but have learnt it through Tonic Sol-fa, using the  course entitled \"Crotchets and Quavers.\" Occasionally the whole  rehearsal consists of sol-faing. In every difficulty as to key  relationship the Sol-fa makes matters clear. Dr. Creser was first led to  use Tonic Sol-fa by noticing how easy it made the minor mode. The junior  boys are always taught by Dr. Creser. Until the voices settle he would  on no account delegate them to an assistant. The two chief rules of  voice-training are to forbid forcing the chest register above  [Illustration: a music staff with a treble clef and a whole note \"E\" on  the first line.] and to begin scales at the top. Flattening takes place  occasionally, but it is nearly always the fault of the congregation, who  drag the pitch down. The arrangement of the music-library here is a  model of order.      ST. PETER'S, EATON SQUARE, LONDON.    Here, under the direction of Mr. de Manby Sergison, a very fine Anglican  service is maintained. There are twenty boys, and a few probationers.  The boys have an hour's practice every day, and sing the Psalms and a  hymn at the daily choral service. Formerly a choir boarding-school was  kept up, but this was abolished, being found to be too expensive. Now  the boys are selected from schools in and near the parish, and Mr.  Sergison finds the ordinary London boy equal to all the demands of the  church. When the choir-school was given up he was able within a month to  prepare an entirely new set of boys, so proficient that the congregation  scarcely noticed a difference. The vocal practice of the boys includes  \"Concone's Exercises,\" and their phrasing in the service music is very  good. The full choir sings on Sundays and Saints' Days, and their  rehearsal takes place once a week in the church, Mr. Sergison being at  the organ. In the chapter on the management of choir-boys I have quoted  some wise remarks by "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3226"],[0,"Records of Journeys to Venice and the Low Countries (#13)"],[1,"about eighteen years old, called  Susanna, who has illuminated a little page with a Saviour,  for which I gave her 1 florin. It is very wonderful that a  woman's picture should be so good. Have lost 6 stivers at  play. I saw the great procession at Antwerp on Holy Trinity  Day. Master Conrad has given me a beautiful pair of knives,  and so I gave his little old man a \"Life of Our Lady\" in  return. I have taken the portrait in charcoal of Johann, the  Brussels goldsmith, likewise his wife's. I have received 2  florins for prints, also Master Johann, the Brussels  goldsmith, paid me 3 Philip's florins for what I did for  him, namely, the drawing for the seal and the two portraits.    I have given the \"Veronica\" which I painted in oils, and the  \"Adam and Eve\" that Franz did to Johann, the goldsmith, in  return for a jacinth and an agate with a Lucrecia engraved  in it. Each of us valued his portion at 14 florins. Further,  I gave him a whole set of engravings for a ring and six  stones; each valued his portion at 7 florins. Gave 14  stivers for two pairs of gloves; gave 2 stivers for two  small boxes; changed 2 Philip's florins for expenses. I drew  three \"Bearing of the Cross\" and two \"Mount of Olives\" on  five half-sheets. I have taken three portraits in black and  white on gray paper; also I drew in black and white on gray  paper, two Netherlandish costumes. For the Englishman I have  painted his arms in colours, for which he gave me 1 florin.  Besides this, one way and another, I have done many drawings  and other things to serve people, and for the greater part  of my work I have received nothing. Andreas of Cracow paid  me 1 Philip's florin for a shield and a child's head.  Changed 1 florin for expenses. Have given 2 stivers for  sweeping brushes. At Antwerp I saw the great procession on  Corpus Christi Day, which was very splendid. Gave in the 4  stivers for a tip and 6 stivers to the doctor; changed 1  florin for expenses; 1 stiver for a box. Have dined five  times with Tomasin; paid 10 stivers to the apothecary and to  his wife 14 stivers for the clyster, and 15 stivers to him  for the prescription. Again changed 2 Philip's florins for  expenses; 6 stivers again to the doctor, and once more 10  stivers for a clyster to the apothecary's wife, and 4  stivers to the apothecary. I gave the monk who confessed my  wife 8 stivers. I have given 8 florins for a whole piece of  arras, and again for fourteen ells of fine arras, 8 florins:  the apothecary 32 stivers for medicines; to the messenger I  have given 3 stivers and the tailor 4 stivers. I have dined  once with Hans Fehler, and thrice with Tomasin. Gave 10  stivers for packing.    On the Wednesday after Corpus Christi in the year 1521, I  gave over my great bale at Antwerp to be sent to Nuremberg,  to the carrier, by name Kunz Metz of Schlaudersdorf, and I  am to pay him for carrying it to Nuremberg 1 1/2 florins for  every cwt., and I paid him 1 gulden on account, and he is to  hand it over to Herr Hans Imhof, the elder. I have done the  portrait of young Jacob Rehlinger at Antwerp; have dined  three times with Tomasin.    On the eighth day after Corpus Christi I went with my wife  to Mechlin to Lady Margaret; took 5 florins with me for  expenses; my wife changed 1 florin for expenses. At Mechlin  I lodged with Master Heinrich, the painter, at the sign of  the Golden Head. The painters and sculptors made me their  guest at my inn, and did me great honour in their gathering;  and I visited the Poppenreuter's, the gun-maker's house, and  found wonderful things there. And I have been to Lady  Margaret's, and I let her see my Kaiser, and would have  presented it to her, but she disliked it so much that I took  it away again. And on Friday Lady Margaret showed me all her  beautiful things, and among them I saw about forty small  pictures in oils, the like of which for cleanness and  excellence I have never seen. And there I saw other good  works by Jan [Van Eyck] and Jacopo [de' Barbari]. I asked my  lady for Jacopo's little book, but she said she had promised  it to her painter; then I saw many other costly things and a  fine library. Master Hans Poppenreuter invited me as his  guest. I have had Master Conrad twice, and his wife once, as  my guests, also the chamberlain Stephen and his wife, both  as guests. 27 stivers and 2 stivers for fare. I have taken  in charcoal the portrait of Stephen, the chamberlain, and  Master Conrad, the carver, and on Saturday I came back from  Mechlin to Antwerp. My trunk started on the Saturday after  Corpus Christi week. Changed 1 florin for expenses, gave the  messenger 3 stivers. Dined twice with the Augustines; dined  with Alexander Imhof; paid 6 stivers at the apothecary's;  dined again with the Augustines.    I have drawn in charcoal Master Jacob, and had a little  panel made for it, which cost 6 stivers, and gave it to him.  I have done the portrait of Bernhard Stecher and his wife,  and gave him a whole set of prints, and I took his wife's  portrait again, and gave 6 stivers for making the little  panel, all of which I gave him, and he in return gave me 10  florins.    Master Lucas, who engraves in copper, invited me as his  guest. He is a little man, born at Leyden, in Holland, and  was at Antwerp. I have eaten with Master Bernhard Stecher.  Gave 1 1/2 stivers to the messenger; have taken 1 florin, 1  ort, for prints. I have drawn Master Lucas von Leyden in  silverpoint. I have lost 1 florin; paid the doctor 6 stivers  and again 6 stivers. I gave the steward of the Augustines'  Convent at Antwerp a \"Life of Our Lady,\" and 4 stivers to  his man, I have given Master Jacob a copper \"Passion\" and a  wood \"Passion,\" and five other pieces, and 4 stivers to his  man; have changed 4 florins for expenses; gave 2 Philip's  florins for fourteen fish skins; made portraits in black  chalk of Art Braun and his wife. I gave the goldsmith who  valued the ring for me 1 florin's worth of prints; of the  three rings which I took in exchange for prints, the two  smaller are valued at 13 crowns, but the sapphire at 25  crowns; that makes 54 florins, 8 stivers; and what, amongst  other things, the above Frenchman took was thirty-six large  books, which makes 9 florins. Have given 2 stivers for a  screw knife. The man with the three rings has overreached me  by a half. I understood nothing in the matter. I gave 18  stivers for a red cap for my godchild; lost 12 stivers at  play; drank 2 stivers, bought three fine small rubies for 11  gold florins, 1 2 stivers; changed 1 florin for expenses.  Dined again with the Augustines; dined twice with Tomasin. I  gave 6 stivers for thirteen porpoise-bristle brushes, and 3  stivers for six bristle brushes.    I have made a careful portrait in black chalk on a royal  sheet of the great Anthony Hainault, and I have done careful  portraits in black chalk of Braun and his wife on royal  sheets, and I have done another one of him in silverpoint;  he has given me an angel. Changed 1 florin for expenses,  paid 1 florin for a pair of shoes; gave 6 stivers for an  inkstand. I gave 12 stivers for a case for packing; 21  stivers for one dozen ladies' gloves; 6 stivers for a bag; 3  stivers for three bristle brushes; changed 1 florin for  expenses; gave 1 stiver for a piece of fine red leather.  Anthony Hainault, whose portrait I did, has given me 3  Philip's florins, and Bernhard Stecher has made me a present  of a tortoise shell; I have done the portrait of his wife's  niece; dined once with her husband and he gave me 2 Philip's  florins; gave 1 stiver for a tip.

I gave  Peter two whole sheet engravings and one sheet of woodcut.  Again dined twice with Tomasin; changed 1 florin for  expenses. I gave Master Art, the glass painter, a \"Life of  Our Lady,\" and I gave Master Jean, the French sculptor, a  whole set of prints; he gave my wife six little glasses with  rose water; they are very finely made.    Bought a packing-case for 7 stivers; changed 1 florin for  expenses; have given 7 stivers for a cut [leather] bag.  Cornelius, the secretary, has given me Luther's \"Babylonian  Captivity:\" in return I gave him my three big books.

Changed 2  florins for expenses; gave the tailor's man 2 stivers for a  tip. I have reckoned up with Jobst and I owe him 31 florins,  which I paid him. Therein were charged and deducted two  portrait heads which I painted in oils, for which he gave me  five pounds of borax, Netherlandish weight.    In all my doings, spendings, sales, and other dealings in  the Netherlands, in all my affairs with high and low, I have  suffered loss, "]]]
