If every one of these unfortunate women had been  made to believe firmly, as an article of faith, that worthy motherhood  was her highest destiny, there might be a good many less noughts to this  number.    Miss Meakin continues: 'Besides the sacred duties of motherhood, there  are the equally sacred duties of fatherhood, yet man does not allow  these latter to interfere with his mental growth.' Nor is there any need  that woman should do so; the idea that a woman, to be a good wife and  mother, must necessarily stunt her mental growth and forego all culture  has long since been discarded.    To my mind the whole trouble arises from the practice of teaching one  set of catchwords to girls and another to boys, as Stevenson says. Since  women cannot be mothers by themselves, it is useless to teach girls that  motherhood is their highest destiny when we do not also teach boys that  fatherhood is theirs, but--quite the contrary--give them to understand  that marriage is something to be avoided, in early manhood at least.    If we were to instruct all young people of _both_ sexes that worthy  marriage and parenthood are the highest destiny for average mortals,  and they acted on this precept, many of the problems of the day would be  solved, the numbers of superfluous women would be greatly reduced, the  social evil would perceptibly diminish, the physique of the race would  improve, and the birth-rate would quickly rise. In short, there would be  less ironical laughter in heaven, and a great deal more honest happiness  and health on earth! I shall have more to say of parenthood as an ideal  in Part IV.            VI      'KEEPING ONLY TO HER': THE CRUX OF MATRIMONY      'We make gods of men and they leave us; others make brutes of them    and they fawn and are faithful!' --OSCAR WILDE.      'It is part of the curse of nature that a man ceases after a time    to worship the body of a woman, and when after that there is nothing    his mind and soul can revere--who shall remain true, as it is    called?' --MARY L. PENDERED.      'And keep thee only to her as long as ye both shall live.' How many men  have solemnly undertaken this exacting vow sincerely meaning to abide by  it? I have no data for answering this question, but I have sufficient  belief in the essential good in human nature to believe that most people  start their married life meaning to be faithful. This belief was not  even shattered by the shock of hearing a very modern bride remark the  other day: 'Max says he can't promise to be faithful but he'll do his  best.' The amazing complacency of the young woman was a thing to marvel  at, though hardly to admire.    Schopenhauer asserts that 'Conjugal fidelity is artificial with men, but  natural to women.' Judging by the Divorce Court returns, it would seem  that this natural feminine trait has weakened somewhat, since this view  was expressed some sixty years ago. According to the Society  chroniclers--self-appointed--it certainly has in 'London's West End,  littered with broken vows.'    It is dangerous to generalise on such a topic, but since people resist  temptation far less often than moralists suppose, it is perhaps safe to  state that when men are faithful, it is principally from lack of  opportunity, or disinclination to be otherwise. This may disgust those  of my feminine readers who refuse to acknowledge, with Professor Lester  Ward, that man is essentially a polygamous animal, but the more  experienced in the sorrowful facts of life will own the truth of this  statement.    On the other hand, when women break their marriage vow, it is seldom for  any merely frivolous or sordid reason (of course excepting the  essentially wanton type, whom no man should be fool enough to marry),  but nearly always either because they are under the spell of infatuation  for the other man, or because they are utterly miserable in their  marriage and seek to drug themselves to forgetfulness or indifference by  means of the poison of some intrigue. Perhaps the Judge who is more  merciful than men will count both these reasons as excuses and will  pardon the sinners who have greatly loved or greatly sorrowed.    A doctor who is interested in the study of social questions once showed  me some interesting statistics on this subject. From seventy-six men  selected at random from his list of acquaintances, fourteen were  childless, and all but two of these were much happier than most men, and  gave their wives no cause for jealousy. This high percentage of happy  though childless marriages is rather curious--I cannot account for it.  Of the remaining sixty-two, all had families: five were fond of their  wives, but not faithful; two lived apart with other women; three others  were unhappily married, quarrelling bitterly and constantly. Of two  others, my friend was doubtful. One other disliked his wife, but was too  busy to bother about other women. The remaining forty-nine were  comparatively happy and devoted: 'Most of them are kept free from any  great temptation by busy lives and regular hours,' the doctor added,  'and those who are especially appreciative or susceptible in regard to  the fair sex have had enough love-making, and want no more outside their  homes.' I suspect this latter cause is applicable to a great many  so-called 'model' husbands!    This list, however, can scarcely be considered representative, as it  contained only two actors, three soldiers, one sailor, and no  stockbrokers--four classes in which inconstant husbands are particularly  numerous. The conditions of an actor's life obviously tend towards  infidelity; the unhealthy excitement and alternating depression of a  stockbroker's existence may have the same effect. Members of the  services are popularly supposed to be less faithful than the rest of  husbands, but possibly if the business and professional men had the same  amount of opportunities and temptation, a similar excess of leisure and  equally long intervals of separation from their wives, they would prove  as inconstant as the country's defenders are supposed to be. My doctor's  list also contains no members of the 'Smart Set,' a class containing  practically no faithful husbands, according to Father Vaughan!    Although it is the little things that spoil conjugal happiness, it is  the big things which separate husband and wife, and of these undoubtedly  infidelity is the most frequent cause. It might truly be called the crux  of marriage. Personally I think only three faults are bad enough to make  it socially worth while for a woman to leave her husband: drunkenness  with violence; misconduct with members of the household, temporary or  permanent; and introducing a mistress under a wife's roof. In the case  of a woman with children, even these are not enough if she cannot take  the children with her. For the last-named act alone a wife could obtain  a divorce under the code of Justinian.    Lapses from the marriage vow on the part of one's spouse are best  treated, like all other troubles, in a philosophical spirit. It is,  however, 'easy to talk!'--one often hears that sexual jealousy is the  most frightful of mental tortures: Men are more keenly affected by it  than women, and the man whose wife has been unfaithful seems to suffer  more acutely, even when he does not care for her, than the woman in the  reverse circumstances. That is because his passions are stronger, a man  will tell you, or because he looks up to the mother of his children as a  being above the sins of the flesh. Probably the real reason is that man  has generally had his own way since the _menage_ in Eden, and he resents  having his belongings taken from him. Woman, however, can bear this  deprivation better, being more accustomed to share her lord from the  time when her sex began to multiply in excess of his--or is it that  women have no instinctive antagonism to polygamy?    The world has become well accustomed to man's polygamous instinct by  now, and even its laws are framed accordingly. In novels, the discovery  of a husband's infidelity always causes a perfect cataclysm; the reader  is treated to page after page of frenzied scenes; the wife almost loses  her reason; her friends and relatives sit in gloomy council deciding  'what is to be done'; the news is shouted from the housetops; and  everybody cuts the man dead.    But in real life, women keep these tragedies to themselves, sometimes  bearing them with a strange calmness and philosophy. Fortunately a man  is seldom so lacking in worldly wisdom as to let his wife discover his  misconduct, and, as a rule, a woman would rather die than reveal such a  wound to the world. The burden of a husband's infidelity is borne for  years in silence with smiling face and head held high, by many a wife  too proud to own herself incapable of keeping a man faithful. Only when  years have accustomed her to the humiliation, and dulled the sharp edge  of her grief, does she permit herself the relief of confidences.    Few women can understand why a husband, though fond of and devoted to  his wife, should nevertheless seek elsewhere that which she has ceased  to possess for him. She whose knowledge of the springs of life is deep  enough to enable her to understand this, knows also that hers is the  better part, that she represents to her husband the centre and  mainspring of his existence, which remains steadfast long after his  temporary amorous madnesses have burned away to ashes.    Nevertheless, after 'Alone'--'_Unfaithful_' is perhaps the saddest and  most awful word in human speech. One can imagine it written innumerable  times, in flaming letters, across the confines of Hell. . . .  _Unfaithful!_            PART III      SUGGESTED ALTERNATIVES        'For me the only remedy to the mortal injustices, to the endless    miseries, to the often"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31534"],[0,"Fifty-Two Sunday Dinners: A Book of Recipes (#13)"],[1," Place liver in a casserole or Dutch oven,  surround with remnants of lardoons. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and  dredge with flour. Surround with one-third cup each of carrots, onion  and celery, cut in small cubes; add one-half teaspoon peppercorns, six  cloves, one spray parsley, a bit of bay leaf and two cups hot Brown  Stock or water. Cover closely and cook in a slow oven two hours. Remove  cover the last half hour of cooking that liver may brown richly. Remove  liver to serving platter, set aside in a warm place. Strain liquor in  casserole and use for making a Brown Sauce. Pour sauce around liver and  serve. Braised liver may be served cold, thinly sliced.      RICE AU GRATIN              1-1/2 cups steamed or boiled rice.            1 tablespoon salt.            1-1/2 tablespoons butter.            1/3 lb. grated cheese.            Cayenne.            Milk.            Buttered cracker crumbs.    PROCESS: When steaming or boiling the rice, allow one tablespoon of salt  for seasoning. Butter a baking dish and cover with a layer of rice, dot  over with some of the butter. Sprinkle with a thin layer of cheese and a  slight sprinkle cayenne; repeat alternate layers until rice and cheese  are used. Pour on milk to half the depth of baking dish, cover with  buttered cracker crumbs and bake in oven until cheese melts and crumbs  are brown.      CARROTS AND TURNIPS IN CREAM SAUCE    Scrub, scrape and cut carrots in small cubes. Wash, pare and cut  purple-top turnips the same. (There should be one and one-half cups of  each.) Cover each (in separate vessels) with boiling water and cook  until tender; add salt the last half hour of cooking. Drain well, toss  together and reheat in one and one-half cups Thin White Sauce.      ASPARAGUS SALAD    Cook asparagus in the usual way, drain and slip three or four spears  through an onion ring just large enough to hold them. Arrange these  fagots in nests of crisp lettuce heart leaves. Just before serving pour  over French Dressing to which has been added one tablespoon of finely  chopped chives. A band of red or green pepper may be used in place of  the onion ring. Canned asparagus should first be drained from the liquor  in the can then rinsed with cold water. Chilled and served as directed  in the foregoing.      CUSTARD PIE    Line a deep, perforated pie tin with Plain or Rich Paste. For filling,  beat three eggs slightly, add one-fourth cup sugar, one-eighth teaspoon  salt, one-eighth teaspoon nutmeg, and pour over slowly two cups scalded  milk, stirring constantly. Bake in a hot oven at first, to set the crust  or rim, then reduce the heat afterwards; as this is a combination of  eggs and milk it should be finished in a slow oven.

BOILED CORNED BEEF WITH VEGETABLES    Select five or six pounds from the plate or the brisket; wash carefully  in cold water, drain; place in kettle and cover with boiling water, let  boil five minutes and--if very briny--drain, rinse off scum with hot  water and again cover with boiling water; heat to boiling point and  simmer until meat is tender (about six hours). Remove beef from liquor,  keep covered in a warm place. Skim off some of the fat from liquor. Add  carrots washed, scraped and cut in quarters. Let cook fifteen minutes,  then add small white onions and turnips pared and cut in quarters, one  head white cabbage cut in quarters (stalk cut out). Wash, pare and cut  uniform-sized potatoes in quarters, parboil five minutes, then drain and  add to other ingredients. Cook beets in a separate vessel. When  vegetables are soft, arrange meat in center of hot serving platter and  surround with carrots, turnips, onions and cabbage. Sprinkle vegetables  with finely chopped parsley, serve beets in separate dish. Pass  horseradish, mustard and vinegar.      DANDELION SALAD    Gather the dandelion when young and tender. That which is cultivated is  well bleached and very tender. Wash thoroughly in several waters, cut  off the roots and outside leaves. Drain dry on a cloth or in a wire  basket. Arrange in salad bowl. Cut thin sweet bacon in tiny shreds  crosswise and saute in frying pan until crisp; sprinkle bacon over  dandelion. To the fat in pan (there should be one-third cup), add  one-fourth cup vinegar diluted with two tablespoons water. Heat to  boiling point and pour over dandelions; toss leaves with a fork until  well mixed with dressing; serve at once.      FROZEN STRAWBERRIES--No. 2              2 quarts cream.            2 cups sugar.            Few grains salt.            2 cups strawberry juice and pulp.    PROCESS: Wash and hull strawberries (about three boxes); sprinkle with  one cup sugar, cover closely and set aside in a cool place for two  hours. Mash and squeeze berries through cheese cloth. Mix remaining cup  sugar and salt with cream; turn into freezer and, when half frozen, add  strawberries and finish freezing. Serve with Strawberry Sauce.    STRAWBERRY SAUCE              1 cup sugar.            1/3 cup water.            2 cups strawberry pulp.

Salt, cayenne and nutmeg.            1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley.    PROCESS: Heat water to boiling, season with salt and add rice, onion and  green pepper (discarding seeds and veins). Cook until rice is soft; rub  through a sieve. Melt butter in a saucepan, add flour, stir to a smooth  paste, add cream slowly, stirring constantly. Add seasonings and cook  over hot water ten minutes. Combine with rice mixture, continue cooking  five minutes. Turn into hot soup tureen and sprinkle over with parsley.      FLANK STEAK STUFFED AND BRAISED    Select a flank steak weighing about two and one-half pounds. Have the  butcher peel off the superfluous fat and tissue and score both sides  diagonally in opposite directions. Remove the steak from paper when it  comes from market and lay it flat on meat board, sprinkle with salt and  pepper. Spread over it a thin layer of stuffing, (see Page 154), roll  lengthwise, very compactly, sew the overlapping edge securely, also the  ends. Sprinkle roll with salt, pepper and dredge with flour. Place meat  in pan with enough Cottolene to brown it richly, turning roll until it  is richly browned all over. Then remove to Dutch oven or casserole;  rinse dripping pan with a little boiling water, pour over meat and  surround with two cups stewed and strained tomato pulp, one onion thinly  sliced, one green pepper shredded (after removing seeds and veins), two  sprays parsley, the half of a small bay leaf and two tablespoons  Worcestershire sauce. Cover closely, place in oven and cook meat very  slowly about three to four hours. Remove meat to serving platter. Dilute  four tablespoons flour with cold water to the consistency to pour, add  to sauce in pan, stir until well blended, season with salt and pepper;  let simmer ten minutes, then strain around meat. Garnish with sprays of  parsley or cress.      DANDELION GREENS    Remove the roots, carefully pick over (discarding all tough and wilted  leaves) and wash dandelion leaves in several waters; to the last water  add salt to free leaves from insects and vermin. It will require one  peck of leaves to serve a family of six. Cook leaves in plenty of  boiling salted water until tender; drain at once and chop fine. Dress  with butter and pepper; cut thin slices of bacon in shreds crosswise,  try it out and pour over dandelions. (There should be one-third cup  bacon fat.) The shreds of bacon are an attractive garnish; hard-cooked  eggs may also be used as a garnish. Cut them in eighths or rings.  Vinegar is sometimes added. Serve hot.
