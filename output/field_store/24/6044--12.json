Barre withdrew to  Chinon, the senior canons rejoined their chapters, and the nuns, happily  rescued for the time, resumed their life of retirement and tranquillity.  The archbishop nevertheless urged on Grandier the prudence of effecting  an exchange of benefices, but he replied that he would not at that  moment change his simple living of Loudun for a bishopric.          CHAPTER VIII      The exposure of the plot was most prejudicial to the prosperity of the  Ursuline community: spurious possession, far from bringing to their  convent an increase of subscriptions and enhancing their reputation, as  Mignon had promised, had ended for them in open shame, while in private  they suffered from straitened circumstances, for the parents of their  boarders hastened to withdraw their daughters from the convent, and the  nuns in losing their pupils lost their sole source of income. Their,  fall in the estimation of the public filled them with despair, and it  leaked out that they had had several altercations with their director,  during which they reproached him for having, by making them commit such  a great sin, overwhelmed them with infamy and reduced them to misery,  instead of securing for them the great spiritual and temporal advantages  he had promised them. Mignon, although devoured by hate, was obliged to  remain quiet, but he was none the less as determined as ever to have  revenge, and as he was one of those men who never give up while a gleam  of hope remains, and whom no waiting can tire, he bided his time,  avoiding notice, apparently resigned to circumstances, but keeping his  eyes fixed on Grandier, ready to seize on the first chance of recovering  possession of the prey that had escaped his hands. And unluckily the  chance soon presented itself.    It was now 1633: Richelieu was at the height of his power, carrying out  his work of destruction, making castles fall before him where he could  not make heads fall, in the spirit of John Knox's words, \"Destroy the  nests and the crows will disappear.\" Now one of these nests was the  crenellated castle of Loudun, and Richelieu had therefore ordered its  demolition.    The person appointed to carry out this order was a man such as those  whom Louis XI. had employed fifty years earlier to destroy the feudal  system, and Robespierre one hundred and fifty years later to destroy the  aristocracy. Every woodman needs an axe, every reaper a sickle, and  Richelieu found the instrument he required in de Laubardemont,  Councillor of State.    But he was an instrument full of intelligence, detecting by the manner  in which he was wielded the moving passion of the wielder, and adapting  his whole nature with marvellous dexterity to gratify that passion  according to the character of him whom it possessed; now by a rough and  ready impetuosity, now by a deliberate and hidden advance; equally  willing to strike with the sword or to poison by calumny, as the man who  moved him lusted for the blood or sought to accomplish the dishonour of  his victim.    M de Laubardemont arrived at Loudun during the month of August 1633, and  in order to carry out his mission addressed himself to Sieur Memin de  Silly, prefect of the town, that old friend of the cardinal's whom  Mignon and Barre, as we have said, had impressed so favourably. Memin  saw in the arrival of Laubardemont a special intimation that it was the  will of Heaven that the seemingly lost cause of those in whom he took  such a warm interest should ultimately triumph. He presented Mignon and  all his friends to M. Laubardemont, who received them with much  cordiality. They talked of the mother superior, who was a relation, as  we have seen, of M. de Laubardemont, and exaggerated the insult offered  her by the decree of the archbishop, saying it was an affront to the  whole family; and before long the one thing alone which occupied the  thoughts of the conspirators and the councillor was how best to draw  down upon Grandier the anger of the cardinal-duke. A way soon opened.    The Queen mother, Marie de Medici, had among her attendants a woman  called Hammon, to whom, having once had occasion to speak, she had taken  a fancy, and given a post near her person. In consequence of this whim,  Hammon came to be regarded as a person of some importance in the queen's  household. Hammon was a native of Loudun, and had passed the greater  part of her youth there with her own people, who belonged to the lower  classes. Grandier had been her confessor, and she attended his church,  and as she was lively and clever he enjoyed talking to her, so that at  length an intimacy sprang up between them. It so happened at a time when  he and the other ministers were in momentary disgrace, that a satire  full of biting wit and raillery appeared, directed especially against  the cardinal, and this satire had been attributed to Hammon, who was  known to share, as was natural, her mistress's hatred of Richelieu.  Protected as she was by the queen's favour, the cardinal had found it  impossible to punish Hammon, but he still cherished a deep resentment  against her.    It now occurred to the conspirators to accuse Grandier of being the real  author of the satire; and it was asserted that he had learned from  Hammon all the details of the cardinal's private life, the knowledge of  which gave so much point to the attack on him; if they could once  succeed in making Richelieu believe this, Grandier was lost.    This plan being decided on, M. de Laubardemont was asked to visit the  convent, and the devils knowing what an important personage he was,  flocked thither to give him a worthy welcome. Accordingly, the nuns had  attacks of the most indescribably violent convulsions, and M. de  Laubardemont returned to Paris convinced as to the reality of their  possession.    The first word the councillor of state said to the cardinal about Urbain  Grandier showed him that he had taken useless trouble in inventing the  story about the satire, for by the bare mention of his name he was able  to arouse the cardinal's anger to any height he wished. The fact was,  that when Richelieu had been Prior of Coussay he and Grandier had had a  quarrel on a question of etiquette, the latter as priest of Loudun  having claimed precedence over the prior, and carried his point. The  cardinal had noted the affront in his bloodstained tablets, and at the  first hint de Laubardemont found him as eager to bring about Grandier's  ruin as was the councillor himself.    De Laubardemont was at once granted the following commission:    \"Sieur de Laubardemont, Councillor of State and Privy Councillor, will  betake himself to Loudun, and to whatever other places may be necessary,  to institute proceedings against Grandier on all the charges formerly  preferred against him, and on other facts which have since come to  light, touching the possession by evil spirits of the Ursuline nuns of  Loudun, and of other persons, who are said like wise to be tormented of  devils through the evil practices of the said Grandier; he will  diligently investigate everything from the beginning that has any  bearing either on the said possession or on the exorcisms, and will  forward to us his report thereon, and the reports and other documents  sent in by former commissioners and delegates, and will be present at  all future exorcisms, and take proper steps to obtain evidence of the  said facts, that they may be clearly established; and, above all, will  direct, institute, and carry through the said proceedings against  Grandier and all others who have been involved with him in the said  case, until definitive sentence be passed; and in spite of any appeal or  countercharge this cause will not be delayed (but without prejudice to  the right of appeal in other causes), on account of the nature of the  crimes, and no regard will be paid to any request for postponement made  by the said Grandier. His majesty commands all governors, provincial  lieutenant-generals, bailiffs, seneschals, and other municipal  authorities, and all subjects whom it may concern, to give every  assistance in arresting and imprisoning all persons whom it may be  necessary to put under constraint, if they shall be required so to do.\"    Furnished with this order, which was equivalent to a condemnation, de  Laubardemont arrived at Laudun, the 5th of December, 1633, at nine  o'clock in the evening; and to avoid being seen he alighted in a suburb  at the house of one maitre Paul Aubin, king's usher, and son-in-law of  Memin de Silly. His arrival was kept so secret that neither Grandier nor  his friends knew of it, but Memin, Herve Menuau, and Mignon were  notified, and immediately called on him. De Laubardemont received them,  commission in hand, but broad as it was, it did not seem to them  sufficient, for it contained no order for Grandier's arrest, and  Grandier might fly. De Laubardemont, smiling at the idea that he could  be so much in fault, drew from his pocket an order in duplicate, in case  one copy should be lost, dated like the commission, November 30th,  signed LOUIS, and countersigned PHILIPPEAUX. It was conceived in the  following terms:    LOUIS, etc. etc. \"We have entrusted these presents to Sieur de  Laubardemont, Privy Councillor, to empower the said Sieur de  Laubardemont to arrest Grandier and his accomplices and imprison them in  a secure place, with orders to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2748"],[0,"Derues (#13)"],[1," \"What a question, master!\" answered the mason. \"Work is so scarce that I  am going back into the country this very evening.\"    \"Very well! Bring your tools, spade, and pickaxe, and follow me.\"    They both went down to the cellar, and the mason was ordered to dig out  the pit till it was five and a half feet deep. While the man worked,  Derues sat beside the chest and read. When it was half done, the mason  stopped for breath, and leaning on his spade, inquired why he wanted a  trench of such a depth. Derues, who had probably foreseen the question,  answered at once, without being disconcerted--    \"I want to bury some bottled wine which is contained in this case.\"    \"Wine!\" said the other. \"Ah! you are laughing at me, because you think I  look a fool! I never yet heard of such a recipe for improving wine.\"    \"Where do you come from?\"    \"D'Alencon.\"    \"Cider drinker! You were brought up in Normandy, that is clear. Well,  you can learn from me, Jean-Baptiste Ducoudray, a wine grower of Tours,  and a wine merchant for the last ten years, that new wine thus buried  for a year acquires the quality and characteristics of the oldest  brands.\"    \"It is possible,\" said the mason, again taking his spade, \"but all the  same it seems a little odd to me.\"    When he had finished, Derues asked him to help to drag the chest  alongside the trench, so that it might be easier to take out the bottles  and arrange them: The mason agreed, but when he moved the chest the  foetid odour which proceeded from it made him draw back, declaring that  a smell such as that could not possibly proceed from wine. Derues tried  to persuade him that the smell came from drains under the cellar, the  pipe of which could be seen. It appeared to satisfy him, and he again  took hold of the chest, but immediately let it go again, and said  positively that he could not execute Derues' orders, being convinced  that the chest must contain a decomposing corpse. Then Derues threw  himself at the man's feet and acknowledged that it was the dead body of  a woman who had unfortunately lodged in his house, and who had died  there suddenly from an unknown malady, and that, dreading lest he should  be accused of having murdered her, he had decided to conceal the death  and bury her here.    The mason listened, alarmed at this confidence, and not knowing whether  to believe it or not. Derues sobbed and wept at his feet, beat his  breast and tore out his hair, calling on God and the saints as witnesses  of his good faith and his innocence. He showed the book he was reading  while the mason excavated: it was the Seven Penitential Psalms. \"How  unfortunate I am!\" he cried. \"This woman died in my house, I assure  you--died suddenly, before I could call a doctor. I was alone; I might  have been accused, imprisoned, perhaps condemned for a crime I did not  commit. Do not ruin me! You leave Paris to-night, you need not be  uneasy; no one would know that I employed you, if this unhappy affair  should ever be discovered. I do not know your name, I do not wish to  know it, and I tell you mine, it is Ducoudray. I give myself up to you,  but have some pity!--if not for me, yet for my wife and my two little  children--for these poor creatures whose only support I am!\"    Seeing that the mason was touched, Derues opened the chest.    \"Look,\" he said, \"examine the body of this woman, does it show any mark  of violent death? My God!\" he continued, joining his hands and in tones  of despairing agony,--\"my God, Thou who readest all hearts, and who  knowest my innocence, canst Thou not ordain a miracle to save an honest  man? Wilt Thou not command this dead body to bear witness for me?\"    The mason was stupefied by this flow of language. Unable to restrain his  tears, he promised to keep silence, persuaded that Derues was innocent,  and that appearances only were against him. The latter, moreover, did  not neglect other means of persuasion; he handed the mason two gold  pieces, and between them they buried the body of Madame de Lamotte.    However extraordinary this fact, which might easily be supposed  imaginary, may appear, it certainly happened. In the examination at his  trial. Derues himself revealed it, repeating the story which had  satisfied the mason. He believed that this man had denounced him: he was  mistaken, for this confidant of his crime, who might have been the first  to put justice on his track, never reappeared, and but for Derues'  acknowledgment his existence would have remained unknown.    This first deed accomplished, another victim was already appointed.  Trembling at first as to the consequences of his forced confession,  Derues waited some days, paying, however, his creditor as promised. He  redoubles his demonstrations of piety, he casts a furtive glance on  everyone he meets, seeking for some expression of distrust. But no one  avoids him, or points him out with a raised finger, or whispers on  seeing him; everywhere he encounters the customary expression of  goodwill. Nothing has changed; suspicion passes over his head without  alighting there. He is reassured, and resumes his work. Moreover, had he  wished to remain passive, he could not have done so; he was now  compelled to follow that fatal law of crime which demands that blood  must be effaced with blood, and which is compelled to appeal again to  death in order to stifle the accusing voice already issuing from the  tomb.    Edouard de Lamotte, loving his mother as much as she loved him, became  uneasy at receiving no visits, and was astonished at this sudden  indifference. Derues wrote to him as follows:    \"I have at length some good news for you, my dear boy, but you must not  tell your mother I have betrayed her secret; she would scold me, because  she is planning a surprise for you, and the various steps and care  necessary in arranging this important matter have caused her absence.  You were to know nothing until the 11th or 12th of this month, but now  that all is settled, I should blame myself if I prolonged the  uncertainty in which you have been left, only you must promise me to  look as much astonished as possible. Your mother, who only lives for  you, is going to present you with the greatest gift a youth of your age  can receive--that of liberty. Yes, dear boy, we thought we had  discovered that you have no very keen taste for study, and that a  secluded life will suit neither your character nor your health. In  saying this I utter no reproach, for every man is born with his own  decided tastes, and the way to success and happiness is-often-to allow  him to follow these instincts. We have had long discussions on this  subject--your mother and I--and we have thought much about your future;  she has at last come to a decision, and for the last ten days has been  at Versailles, endeavouring to obtain your admission as a royal page.  Here is the mystery, this is the reason which has kept her from you, and  as she knew you would hear it with delight, she wished to have the  pleasure of telling you herself. Therefore, once again, when you see  her, which will be very soon, do not let her see I have told you; appear  to be greatly surprised. It is true that I am asking you to tell a lie,  but it is a very innocent one, and its good intention will counteract  its sinfulness--may God grant we never have worse upon our consciences!  Thus, instead of lessons and the solemn precepts of your tutors, instead  of a monotonous school-life, you are going to enjoy your liberty; also  the pleasures of the court and the world. All that rather alarms me, and  I ought to confess that I at first opposed this plan. I begged your  mother to reflect, to consider that in this new existence you would run  great risk of losing the religious feeling which inspires you, and which  I have had the happiness, during my sojourn at Buisson-Souef, of further  developing in your mind. I still recall with emotion your fervid and  sincere aspirations towards the Creator when you approached the Sacred  Table for the first time, and when, kneeling beside you, and envying the  purity of heart and innocence of soul which appeared to animate your  countenance as with a divine radiance, I besought God that, in default  of my own virtue, the love for heavenly Truth with which I have inspired  you might be reckoned to my account. Your piety is my work, Edouard, and  I defended it against your mother's plans; but she replied that in every  career a man is master of his own good or evil actions; and as I have no  authority over you, and friendship only gives me the right to advise, I  must give way. If this be your vocation, then follow it.    \"My occupations are so numerous (I have to collect from different  sources this hundred thousand livres intended to defray the greater part  of the Buisson purchase) that I have not a moment in which to come and  see you this week. Spend the time in reflection, and write to me fully  what you think about this plan. If, like me, you feel any scruples, you  must tell them to your mother, who decidedly wants only to make you  happy. Speak to me freely, openly. It is arranged that I am to fetch you  on the 11th of this month, and escort you to Versailles, where Madame de  Lamotte will be waiting to receive you with the utmost tenderness.  Adieu, dear boy; write to me. Your father knows nothing as yet; his  consent will be asked after your decision.\"    The answer to this letter did not have to be waited for: it was such as  Derues expected; the lad accepted joyfully. The answer was, for the  murderer, an arranged plea of defence, a proof which, in a given case,  might link the present with the past.    On the morning of February 11th, Shrove Tuesday, he went to fetch the  young de Lamotte from his school, telling the master that he was desired  by the youth's mother to conduct him to Versailles. But, instead, he  took him to his own house, saying that he had a letter from Madame de"]]]
