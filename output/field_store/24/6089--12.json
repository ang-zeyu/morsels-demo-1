[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28957"],[0,"The Acts of the General Assemblies of the Church of Scotland (#13)"],[1,"act was renewed in  the Assembly holden in _December 1564._ where Ministers are referred to  the order set down before the Psalmes, for ministration of the Sacraments;  which is all one with the former: for that was the order of the English  Kirk at _Geneva_.    In the Parliament holden _Anno_ 1567. It was declared that whosoever did  not participate of the Sacraments, as they were then publickly administrat  in this reformed Kirk ought not to be reputed members of this Kirk. The  act for the Kings oath at his coronation, to maintain the due  administration of the Sacraments, as they were then ministred, _Anno_  1567. Was ratified _Anno_ 1581. At which time the short Confession,  adhering to the use of the Sacraments, in the Kirk of _Scotland_, was  subscribed: as also _Anno_ 1592. after the second Subscription to the  confession of Faith. In the Parliament 1572. an act was made against such  as did not participat of the Sacraments as they were then rightly  ministered: But the gesture of kneeling, in the act of receiving, putteth  the ministration of the Sacraments used in this Kirk out of frame: whereby  it is clear that whatsoever gesture or rite, cannot stand with the  administration of the Sacraments as they were then ministred and were  ministred ever since the reformation, till the year 1618. must bee  condemned by our Kirk as a rite added to the true ministration of the  Sacraments without the word of God, and as rite or tradition brought in  without, or against the word of God, or doctrine of this reformed Kirk.    III. Concerning _Confirmation_; The Assembly findeth it to be comprehended  in the clause of the Confession, where the _five bastard Sacraments_ are  condemned. And seeing _Episcopacie_ is condemned, _imposition of hands_ by  Bishops falleth to the ground. And in all the acts for catechising or  examination before admission to the communion, no inkling of _imposition  of hands_.    IIII. Concerning the administration of the Sacraments _in private places_,  or private baptisme, and communion; findeth that in the book of common  order, set down before the Psalmes, it is said, _That the Sacraments art  not ordained of God to be used in private corners, as charmers and  sorcerers use to doe, but left to the Congregation._ In the Assembly  holden at _Edinburgh_ in _October Anno 1581._ the same year and Assembly,  that the confession of Faith was subscribed: It was ordained, _that the  Sacraments be not administred in private houses, but solemnly according to  good order hither to observed_. The Minister of _Tranent_ was suspended at  that time, for baptizing an infant in a private house: but confessing his  offence, he was ordained to make his publick repentance in the Kirk of  _Tranent_, before he be released. Another Minister was to be tried, and  censured, for baptizing privately, and celebrating the Communion upon  _Pasch-day_, at the Assembly holden in _October __ 1580._ Which acts and  censures make manifest, that our Kirk abhorred whatsoever fostered the  opinion of the necessitie of Baptisme, and giving of the Sacrament, as a  _viaticum_.    All which, and many other acts, grounds, and reasons, being at length  agitated, and with mature deliberation pondered, and libertie granted to  every man to speak his minde; what could be said further, for the full  satisfaction of all men.    The matter was put to voicing, in these words: _Whether the five articles  of_ Perth, _by the confession of Faith, as it was meaned and professed in  the year 1580. 1581. 1590. 1591. ought to be removed out of this Kirk:_  The whole Assembly all in one consent, one onely excepted, did voice that  the five articles above specified were abjured by this Kirk, in that  Confession, and so ought to be removed out of it: And therefore  prohibiteth and dischargeth all disputing for them, or observing of them,  or any of them, in all time comming, and ordains Presbyteries to proceed  with the censures of the Kirk against all transgressours.          Act. Sess. 21. December 17. 1638.      Concerning _Kirk Sessions, provinciall_ and _nationall Assemblies_, the  generall Assembly considering the great defection of this Kirk, and decay  of Religion, by the usurpation of the Prelates, and their suppressing of  ordinaire judicatories of the Kirk, and clearly preceiving the benefit  which will redound to the Religion by the restitution of the said  judicatories, remembring also that they stand obliged by their solemne  oath, and covenant with God, to return to the doctrine and discipline of  this Kirk; as it was profest 1580, 1581, 1590, 1591. which in the book of  Policie, registrat in the books of the Assembly 1581. and ordained to be  subscribed, 1590, 1591. is particularly exprest both touching the  constitution of the Assemblies, of their members, Ministers, and Elders,  and touching the number, power, and authority of these members, in all  matters ecclesiastical.    The Assembly findeth it necessar to restore, and by these presents  restoreth all these Assemblies unto their full integritie in their  members, priviledges, liberties, powers, and jurisdictions; as they were  constitute by the foresaid book of Policie.          Act. Sess. 23, 24. December 17. 18.      Anent the report of the Committie, appointed for considering what  constitutions were to be revived, or made of new, they proponed the  overtures following: which were read and allowed by the whole Assembly, or  by them referred to the consideration of the severall Presbyteries.    Anent _Presbyteries_ which have been erected since the year 1586. It  seemeth needfull, that they bee ratified by an act of this generall  Assembly, and that other Presbyteries shall be erected, where they shall  be found needfull, and especially now in the Synod of _Lismore_, according  to the particular note given there anent.    The Assembly ratifieth these Presbyteries since 1486. and erected those in  _Lismore_, conforme to the note registrat in the books of Assembly.    Anent the keeping of _Presbyteriall meetings_; It is thought fit that they  be weekly, both in Sommer and Winter, except in places farre distant, who  during the winter season, (that is between the first of _October_ and the  first of _April_) shall be dispensed with for meeting once in the fourteen  dayes, and that all absents be censured, especially those who should  _exercise_ and _adde_, according to the Act of Assembly 1582. at St.  _Andrews_, _April 24. Sess. 12._ and that some controverted head of  doctrine bee handled in the presbyterie publikly, and disputed among the  brethren, every first Presbyterie of the Moneth, according to the act of  Assembly holden at _Dundie_ 1598. Sess. 12.    _The Assembly alloweth this Article._    Anent the _visitation of particular Kirks_ within Presbyteries; It is  thought expedient that it be once every year, wherein a care is to be had,  among other things necessary, that it bee tryed, how domestick exercises  of Religion be exercised in particular families, and to see what means  there is in every Parish in Landward, for catechising and instructing the  youth.    _The Assembly alloweth this article._    IV. Anent the _visitation of Kirks, Schooles, and Colledges_: It is  thought meet that the acts of Assembly holden at _Edinburgh_ the 25. of  _Junie_ 1565. Sess. 2. be put in execution: that the Ministers of the  parochin, the Principall, _Regents_, and _professours_ within Colledges,  and _Masters_, and Doctors of Schooles, be tryed concerning the soundnesse  of their judgement in matters of Religion, their abilitie, for discharge  of their calling, and the honesty of their conversation: as the act of  Assembly at _Edinburgh_, _Juni 21. 1567._ Sess. 3. And the act of the  Assembly holden at _Montrose_. 1595. Sess. 9. do import: and this  visitation of Colledges to be by way of commission from the generall  Assembly.    _The generall Assembly alloweth this article._    V. Anent _none residents_: It is thought necessary, that every Minister be  oblished to reside in his own Parochin at his ordinarie Manse, for the  better attending of the duties of his calling, conforme to the Acts of  Assemblies, viz. act of Assembly at _Edinburgh_, _March 24. 1595._ Sess.  7. as also act at _Edinburgh_, _December 25. 1563._ Sess. 5. and Assembly  at _Edinburgh_, _December 25. 1565._ Sess. 4. Assembly at _Edinburgh_,  _March 6. 1572._ Sess. 3.    _The Assembly alloweth this article._    VI. Anent the _planting of Schools in Landward_, the want whereof doth  greatly prejudge the grouth of the Gospel and procure the decay of  Religion: The Assembly giveth direction to several Presbyteries for the  setling of Schooles in every Landward Parochin, and providing of men able  for the charge of teaching of the youth, publick reading and precenting of  the Psalme, and the catechising of the common people, and that means be  provided for their intertainment, in the most convenient manner that may  be had, according to the abilitie of the Parochin.    _The Assembly alloweth; and referreth the particular course unto the  severall Presbyteries._    VII. Anent the late _admission of Ministers by Presbyteries_, and the  _choise of Moderatours_, according to the ancient power of the said  Presbyteries: The Assembly declareth they had power to doe the same, and  ratifieth that what hath been done of late of that kinde upon warrantable  grounds, that here after it be not called in question.    _The Assembly alloweth this article._    VIII. Anent the _competencie of Presbyteries and parochins_, that some  proportion may be keeped, both anent the number and distance of place: It  would seem expedient that this generall Assembly should appoint a  Commission for every Shyre, where there is such necessitie, that the  particular Parochins and Presbyteries within the bounds be duely  considered, and overtures be these of the same commission given in to the  provinciall Synods, and by them to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2897"],[0,"The Sequel of Appomattox: A Chronicle of the Reunion of the States (#13)"],[1,"or had been vetoed by the governor. Yet the  statute books do show some discriminations. There is a marked difference  between earlier and later legislation. The more stringent laws were  enacted before the end of 1865. After New Year's Day had passed and the  Negroes had begun to settle down, the legislatures either passed mild  laws or abandoned all special legislation for the Negroes. Later in  1866, several states repealed the legislation of 1865.    In so far as the \"Black Laws\" discriminated against the Negro they were  never enforced but were suspended from the beginning by the army and the  Freedmen's Bureau. They had, however, a very important effect upon that  section of Northern opinion which was already suspicious of the good  faith of the Southerners. They were part of a plan, some believed, to  reenslave the Negro or at least to create by law a class of serfs. This  belief did much to bring about later radical legislation.    If the \"Black Laws\" represented the reaction of the Southern  legislatures to racial conditions, the Freedmen's Bureau was the  corresponding result of the interest taken by the North in the welfare  of the Negro. It was established just as the war was closing and arose  out of the various attempts to meet the Negro problems that arose  during the war. The Bureau had always a dual nature, due in part to its  inheritance of regulations, precedents, and traditions from the various  attempts made during war time to handle the many thousands of Negroes  who came under Federal control, and in part to the humanitarian impulses  of 1865, born of a belief in the capacity of the Negro for freedom and  a suspicion that the Southern whites intended to keep as much of slavery  as they could. The officials of the Bureau likewise were of two classes:  those in control were for the most part army officers, standing as  arbiters between white and black, usually just and seldom the victims of  their sympathies but the mass of less responsible officials were men of  inferior ability and character, either blind partisans of the Negro or  corrupt and subject to purchase by the whites.    In view of the fact that the Freedmen's Bureau was considered a new  institution in 1865, it is rather remarkable how closely it followed in  organization, purpose, and methods the precedents set during the war by  the officers of the army and the Treasury. In Virginia, General Butler,  in 1861, declared escaped slaves to be \"contraband\" and proceeded to  organize them into communities for discipline, work, food, and care. His  successors in Virginia and North Carolina, and others in the Sea Islands  of Georgia and South Carolina, extended his plan and arranged a labor  system with fixed wages, hours, and methods of work, and everywhere  made use of the captured or abandoned property of the Confederates. In  Tennessee and Arkansas, Chaplain John Eaton of Grant's army employed  thousands in a modified free labor system; and further down in  Mississippi and Louisiana Generals Grant, Butler, and Banks also put  large numbers of captured slaves to work for themselves and for the  Government. Everywhere, as the numbers of Negroes increased, the army  commanders divided the occupied Negro regions into districts under  superintendents and other officials, framed labor laws, cooperated  with benevolent societies which gave schooling and medical care to the  blacks, and developed systems of government for them.    The United States Treasury Department, attempting to execute the  confiscation laws for the benefit of the Treasury, appears now and then  as an employer of Negro labor on abandoned plantations. Either alone  or in cooperation with the army and charitable associations, it even  supervised Negro colonies, and sometimes it assumed practically complete  control of the economic welfare of the Negro. This Department introduced  in 1864 an elaborate lessee and trade system. The Negro was regarded as  \"the ward of the nation,\" but he was told impressively that \"labor is a  public duty and idleness and vagrancy a crime.\" All wanted him to work:  the Treasury wanted cotton and other crops to sell; the lessees and  speculators wanted to make fortunes by his labor; and the army wanted  to be free from the burden of the idle blacks. In spite of all these  ministrations, the Negroes suffered much from harsh treatment, neglect,  and unsanitary conditions.    During 1863 and 1864, several influences were urging the establishment  of a national bureau or department to take charge of matters relating to  the African race. Some wished to establish on the borders of the South a  paid labor system, which might later be extended over the entire  region, to get more slaves out of the Confederacy into this free labor  territory, and to prevent immigration of Negroes into the North, which,  after the Emancipation Proclamation, was apprehensive of this danger.  Others wished to relieve the army and the treasury officials of the  burden of caring for the blacks and to protect the latter from the  \"northern harpies and bloodhounds\" who had fastened upon them the lessee  system.    The discussion lasted for two years. The Freedmen's Inquiry Commission,  after a survey of the field in 1863, recommended a consolidation of all  efforts under an organization which should perpetuate the best features  of the old system. But there was much opposition to this plan in  Congress. The Negroes would be exploited, objected some; the scheme  gave too much power to the proposed organization, said others; another  objection was urged against the employment of a horde of incompetent and  unscrupulous officeholders, for \"the men who go down there and become  your overseers and Negro drivers will be your broken-down politicians  and your dilapidated preachers, that description of men who are too lazy  to work and just a little too honest to steal.\"    As the war drew to a close, the advocates of a policy of consolidation  in Negro affairs prevailed, and on March 3, 1865, an act was approved  creating in the War Department a Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and  Abandoned Lands. This Bureau was to continue for one year after the  close of the war, and it was to control all matters relating to freedmen  and refugees, that is, Unionists who had been driven out of the South.  Food, shelter, and clothing were to be given to the needy, and abandoned  or confiscated property was to be used for or leased to freedmen. At  the head of the Bureau was to be a commissioner with an assistant  commissioner for each of the Southern States. These officials and other  employees must take the \"ironclad\" oath.    It was planned that the Bureau should have a brief existence, but the  institution and its wards became such important factors in politics that  on July 16, 1866, after a struggle with the President, Congress passed  an act over his veto amplifying the powers of the Bureau and extending  it for two years longer. This continuation of the Bureau was due to many  things: to a belief that former slaveholders were not to be trusted in  dealing with the Negroes; to the baneful effect of the \"Black Laws\"  upon Northern public opinion; to the struggle between the President  and Congress over reconstruction; and to the foresight of radical  politicians who saw in the institution an instrument for the political  instruction of the blacks in the proper doctrines.    The new law was supplementary to the Act of 1865, but its additional  provisions merely endorsed what the Bureau was already doing. It  authorized the issue of medical supplies, confirmed certain sales of  land to Negroes, and provided that the promises which Sherman made in  1865 to the Sea Island Negroes should be carried out as far as possible  and that no lands occupied by blacks should be restored to the owners  until the crops of 1866 were gathered; it directed the Bureau to  cooperate with private charitable and benevolent associations, and  it authorized the use or sale for school purposes of all confiscated  property; and finally it ordered that the civil equality of the Negro be  upheld by the Bureau and its courts when state courts refused to accept  the principle. By later laws the existence of the Bureau was extended to  January 1, 1869, in the unreconstructed States, but its educational and  financial activities were continued until June 20, 1872.    The chief objections to the Bureau from the conservative Northern  point of view were summed up in the President's veto messages. The laws  creating it were based, he asserted, on the theory that a state of war  still existed; there was too great a concentration of power in the hands  of a few individuals who could not be held responsible; with such a  large number of agents ignorant of the country and often working for  their own advantage injustice would inevitably result; in spite of  the fact that the Negro everywhere had a status in court, arbitrary  tribunals were established, without jury, without regular procedure  or rules of evidence, and without appeal; the provisions in regard to  abandoned lands amounted to confiscation without a hearing; the Negro,  who must in the end work out his own salvation, and who was protected  by the demand for his labor, would be deluded into thinking his future  secure without further effort on his part; although nominally under the  War Department, the Bureau was not subject to military control; it was  practically a great political machine; and, finally, the states most  concerned were not represented in Congress.    The Bureau was soon organized in all the former slaveholding States  except Delaware, with general headquarters in Washington and state  headquarters at the various capitals. General O. O. Howard, who was  appointed commissioner, was a good officer, softhearted, honest,  pious, and frequently referred to as \"the Christian soldier.\" He  was fair-minded and not disposed to irritate the"]]]
