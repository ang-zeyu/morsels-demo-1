When the ambassadors saw the fair  Princess Helena they fell on their knees before her and said: \"Empress  of Rome, all hail!\" But Helena half rose from her seat in anger as she  said: \"What does this mockery mean? You seem to be men of gentle  breeding, and you wear the badge of messengers: whence comes it, then,  that ye mock me thus?\" But the ambassadors calmed her anger, saying:  \"Be not wroth, lady: this is no mockery, for the Emperor of Rome, the  great lord Maxen Wledig, has seen you in a dream, and he has sworn to  wed none but you. Which, therefore, will you choose, to accompany us  to Rome, and there be made empress, or to wait here until the emperor  can come to you?\" The princess thought deeply for a time, and then  replied: \"I would not be too credulous, or too hard of belief. If the  emperor loves me and would wed me, let him find me in my father's  house, and make me his bride in my own home.\"      The Dream Realized    After this the thirteen envoys departed, and returned to the emperor  in such haste that when their horses failed they gave no heed, but  took others and pressed on. When they reached Rome and informed Maxen  Wledig of the success of their mission he at once gathered his army  and marched across Europe towards Britain. When the Roman emperor had  crossed the sea he conquered Britain from Beli the son of Manogan,  and made his way to Arvon. On entering the castle he saw first the two  youths, Kynon and Adeon, playing chess, then their father, Eudav, the  son of Caradoc, and then his beloved, the beauteous Helena, daughter  of Eudav. \"Empress of Rome, all hail!\" Maxen Wledig said; and the  princess bent forward in her chair and kissed him, for she knew he was  her destined husband. The next day they were wedded, and the Emperor  Maxen Wledig gave Helena as dowry all Britain for her father, the son  of the gallant Caradoc, and for herself three castles, Caernarvon,  Caerlleon, and Caermarthen, where she dwelt in turn; and in one of  them was born her son Constantine, the only British-born Emperor of  Rome. To this day in Wales the old Roman roads that connected Helena's  three castles are known as \"Sarn Helen.\"          CHAPTER III: THE STORY OF CONSTANTINE AND ELENE      The Greatness of Constantine Provokes Attack    In the year 312, the sixth year after Constantine had become emperor,  the Roman Empire had increased on every hand, for Constantine was a  mighty leader in war, a gracious and friendly lord in peace; he was a  true king and ruler, a protector of all men. So mightily did he  prosper that his enemies assembled great armies against him, and a  confederation to overthrow him was made by the terrible Huns, the  famous Goths, the brave Franks, and the warlike Hugas. This powerful  confederation sent against Constantine an overwhelming army of Huns,  whose numbers seemed to be countless, and yet the Hunnish leaders  feared, when they knew that the emperor himself led the small Roman  host.      The Eve of the Battle    The night before the battle Constantine lay sadly in the midst of his  army, watching the stars, and dreading the result of the next day's  conflict; for his warriors were few compared with the Hunnish  multitude, and even Roman discipline and devotion might not win the  day against the mad fury of the barbarous Huns. At last, wearied out,  the emperor slept, and a vision came to him in his sleep. He seemed to  see, standing by him, a beautiful shining form, a man more glorious  than the sons of men, who, as Constantine sprang up ready helmed for  war, addressed him by name. The darkness of night fled before the  heavenly light that shone from the angel, and the messenger said:        \"O Constantinus, the Ruler of Angels,      The Lord of all glory, the Master of heaven's hosts,      Claims from thee homage. Be not thou affrighted,      Though armies of aliens array them for battle,      Though terrible warriors threaten fierce conflict.      Look thou to the sky, to the throne of His glory;      There seest thou surely the symbol of conquest.\"        _Elene._      Vision of the Cross    Constantine looked up as the angel bade him, and saw, hovering in the  air, a cross, splendid, glorious, adorned with gems and shining with  heavenly light. On its wood letters were engraved, gleaming with  unearthly radiance:        \"With this shalt thou conquer the foe in the conflict,      And with it shalt hurl back the host of the heathen.\"        _Elene._      Constantine is Cheered    Constantine read these words with awe and gladness, for indeed he knew  not what deity had thus favoured him, but he would not reject the help  of the Unknown God; so he bowed his head in reverence, and when he  looked again the cross and the angel had disappeared, and around him  as he woke was the greyness of the rising dawn. The emperor summoned  to his tent two soldiers from the troops, and bade them make a cross  of wood to bear before the army. This they did, greatly marvelling,  and Constantine called a standard-bearer, to whom he gave charge to  bear forward the Standard of the Cross where the danger was greatest  and the battle most fierce.      The Morning of Battle    When the day broke, and the two armies could see each other, both  hosts arrayed themselves for battle, in serried ranks of armed  warriors, shouting their war-cries.        \"Loud sang the trumpets to stern-minded foemen      The dewy-winged eagle watched them march onward,      The horny-billed raven rejoiced in the battle-play,      The sly wolf, the forest-thief, soon saw his heart's desire      As the fierce warriors rushed at each other.      Great was the shield-breaking, loud was the clamour,      Hard were the hand-blows, and dire was the downfall,      When first the heroes felt the keen arrow-shower.      Soon did the Roman host fall on the death-doomed Huns,      Thrust forth their deadly spears over the yellow shields,      Broke with their battle-glaives breasts of the foemen.\"        _Elene._      The Cross is Raised    Then, when the battle was at its height, and the Romans knew not  whether they would conquer or die fighting to the last, the  standard-bearer raised the Cross, the token of promised victory,  before all the host, and sang the chant of triumph. Onward he marched,  and the Roman host followed him, pressing on resistless as the surging  waves. The Huns, bewildered by the strange rally, and dreading the  mysterious sign of some mighty god, rolled back, at first slowly, and  then more and more quickly, till sullen retreat became panic rout, and  they broke and fled. Multitudes were cut down as they fled, other  multitudes were swept away by the devouring Danube as they tried to  cross its current; some, half dead, reached the other side, and saved  their lives in fortresses, guarding the steep cliffs beyond the  Danube. Few, very few they were who ever saw their native land again.    There was great rejoicing in the Roman army and in the Roman camp when  Constantine returned in triumph with the wondrous Cross borne before  him. He passed on to the city, and the people of Rome gazed with awe  on the token of the Unknown God who had saved their city, but none  would say who that God might be.      A Council Summoned    The emperor summoned a great council of all the wisest men in Rome,  and when all were met he raised the Standard of the Cross in the midst  and said:        \"Can any man tell me, by spells or by ancient lore,      Who is the gracious God, giver of victory,      Who came in His glory, with the Cross for His token,      Who rescued my people and gave me the victory,      Scattered my foemen and put the fierce Huns to flight,      Showed me in heaven His sign of deliverance,      The loveliest Cross of light, gleaming in glory?\"        _Elene._    At first no man could give him any answer--perhaps none dared--till  after a long silence the wisest of all arose and said he had heard  that the Cross was the sign of Christ the King of Heaven, and that the  knowledge of His way was only revealed to men in baptism. When strict  search was made some Christians were found, who preached the way of  life to Constantine, and rejoiced that they might tell before men, of  the life and death, the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus Christ,  who redeemed mankind from the bonds of evil; and then Constantine,  being fully instructed and convinced, was baptized and became the  first Christian emperor.      Constantine Desires to Find our Saviour's Cross    Constantine's heart, however, was too full of love for his new Lord to  let him rest satisfied without some visible token of Christ's sojourn  on earth. He longed to have, to keep for his own, one thing at least  which Jesus had touched during His life, and his thoughts turned  chiefly to that Cross which had been to himself both the sign of  triumph and the guide to the way of life. Thus he again called  together his Christian teachers, and inquired more closely where  Christ had suffered.    \"In Judaea, outside the walls of Jerusalem, He died on the Cross,\" they  told him.    \"Then there, near that city, so blest and so curst, we must seek His  precious Cross,\" cried Constantine.      Summons his Mother Elene    Forthwith he summoned from Britain his mother the British Princess  Elene, and when she had been taught the truth, had been converted and  baptized, he told her of his heart's desire, and begged her to journey  to Jerusalem and seek the sacred Cross.    Elene herself, when she heard Constantine's words, was filled with  wonder, and said: \"Dear son, thy words have greatly rejoiced my heart,  for know that I, too, have seen a vision, and would gladly seek the  Holy Cross, where it lies hidden from the eyes of men.\"      Elene's Vision        \"Now will I tell thee the brightest of visions,      Dreamt at the midnight when men lay in slumber.

She frowned, the struggle she was making naked on her face. Then she  answered:    \"You--Fox--\"    Travis grunted with relief, his alarm subsiding. Then she _could_  remember.    \"Yes,\" he responded eagerly.    But she was gazing about, her puzzlement growing. \"Where is this--?\"    \"We are higher in the mountains.\"    Now fear was pushing out bewilderment. \"How did I come here?\"    \"I brought you.\" Swiftly he outlined what had happened at their night  camp.    The hand which had been at her head was now pressed tight across her  lips as if she were biting furiously into its flesh to still some panic  of her own, and her gray eyes were round and haunted.    \"You are free now,\" Travis said.    Kaydessa nodded, and then dropped her hand to speak. \"You brought me  away from the hunters. You did not have to obey them?\"    \"I heard nothing.\"    \"You do not hear--you feel!\" She shuddered. \"Please.\" She clawed at the  stone beside her, pulling up to her feet. \"Let us go--let us go quickly!  They will try again--move farther in--\"    \"Listen,\" Travis had to be sure of one thing--\"have they any way of  knowing that they had you under control and that you have again  escaped?\"    Kaydessa shook her head, some of the panic again shadowing her eyes.    \"Then we'll just go on--\" his chin lifted to the wastelands before  them--\"try to keep out of their reach.\"    And away from the pass to the south, he told himself silently. He dared  not lead the enemy to that secret, so he must travel west or hole up  somewhere in this unknown wilderness until they could be sure Kaydessa  was no longer susceptible to that call, or that they were safely beyond  its beamed radius. There was the chance of contacting her outlaw kin,  just as there was the chance of stumbling into a pack of the ape-things.  Before dark they must discover a protected camp site.    They needed water, food. He had a bare half dozen ration tablets. But  the coyotes could locate water.    \"Come!\" Travis beckoned to Kaydessa, motioning her to climb ahead of him  so that he could watch for any indication of her succumbing once again  to the influence of the enemy. But his burdened early morning flight had  told on Travis more than he thought, and he discovered he could not spur  himself on to a pace better than a walk. Now and again one of the  coyotes, usually Nalik'ideyu, would come into view, express impatience  in both stance and mental signal, and then be gone again. The Apache was  increasingly aware that the animals were disturbed, yet to his tentative  gropings at contact they did not reply. Since they gave no warning of  hostile animal or man, he could only be on constant guard, watching the  countryside about him.    They had been following a ledge for several minutes before Travis was  aware of some strange features of that path. Perhaps he had actually  noted them with a trained eye before his archaeological studies of the  recent past gave him a reason for the faint marks. This crack in the  mountain's skin might have begun as a natural fault, but afterward it  had been worked with tools, smoothed, widened to serve the purpose of  some form of intelligence!    Travis caught at Kaydessa's shoulder to slow her pace. He could not have  told why he did not want to speak aloud here, but he felt the need for  silence. She glanced around, perplexed, more so when he went down on his  knees and ran his fingers along one of those ancient tool marks. He was  certain it was very old. Inside of him anticipation bubbled. A road made  with such labor could only lead to something of importance. He was going  to make the discovery, the dream which had first drawn him into these  mountains.    \"What is it?\" Kaydessa knelt beside him, frowning at the ledge.    \"This was cut by someone, a long time ago,\" Travis half whispered and  then wondered why. There was no reason to believe the road makers could  hear him when perhaps a thousand years or more lay between the chipping  of that stone and this day.    The Tatar girl looked over her shoulder. Perhaps she too was troubled by  the sense that here time was subtly telescoped, that past and present  might be meeting. Or was that feeling with them both because of their  enforced conditioning?    \"Who?\" Now her voice sank in turn.    \"Listen--\" he regarded her intently--\"did your people or the Reds ever  find any traces of the old civilization here--ruins?\"    \"No.\" She leaned forward, tracing with her own finger the same  almost-obliterated marks which had intrigued Travis. \"But I think they  have looked. Before they discovered that we could be free, they sent out  parties--to hunt, they said--but afterward they always asked many  questions about the country. Only they never asked about ruins. Is that  what they wished us to find? But why? Of what value are old stones piled  on one another?\"    \"In themselves, little, save for the knowledge they may give us of the  people who piled them. But for what the stones might contain--much  value!\"    \"And how do you know what they might contain, Fox?\"    \"Because I have seen such treasure houses of the star men,\" he returned  absently. To him the marks on the ledge were a pledge of greater  discoveries to come. He must find where that carefully constructed road  ran--to what it led. \"Let us see where this will take us.\"    But first he gave the chittering signal in four sharp bursts. And the  tawny-gray bodies came out of the tangled brush, bounding up to the  ledge. Together the coyotes faced him, their attention all for his  halting communication.    Ruins might lie ahead; he hoped that they did. But on another planet  such ruins had twice proved to be deadly traps, and only good fortune  had prevented their closing on Terran explorers. If the ape-things or  any other dangerous form of life had taken up residence before them, he  wanted good warning.    Together the coyotes turned and loped along the now level way of the  ledge, disappearing around a curve fitted to the mountain side while  Travis and Kaydessa followed.    They heard it before they saw its source--a waterfall. Probably not a  large one, but high. Rounding the curve, they came into a fine mist of  spray where sunlight made rainbows of color across a filmy veil of  water.    For a long moment they stood entranced. Kaydessa then gave a little cry,  held out her hands to the purling mist and brought them to her lips  again to suck the gathered moisture.    Water slicked the surface of the ledge, and Travis pushed her back  against the wall of the cliff. As far as he could discern, their road  continued behind the out-flung curtain of water, and footing on the wet  stone was treacherous. With their backs to the solid security of the  wall, facing outward into the solid drape of water, they edged behind it  and came out into rainbowed sunlight again.    Here either provident nature or ancient art had hollowed a pocket in the  stone which was filled with water. They drank. Then Travis filled his  canteen while Kaydessa washed her face, holding the cold freshness of  the moisture to her cheeks with both palms.    She spoke, but he could not hear her through the roar. She leaned closer  and raised her voice to a half shout:    \"This is a place of spirits! Do you not also feel their power, Fox?\"    Perhaps for a space out of time he did feel something. This was a  watering place, perhaps a never-ceasing watering place--and to his  desert-born-and-bred race all water was a spirit gift never to be taken  for granted. The rainbow--the Spirit People's sacred sign--old beliefs  stirred in Travis, moving him. \"I feel,\" he said, nodding in emphasis to  his agreement.    They followed the ledge road to a section where a landslide of an  earlier season had choked it. Travis worked a careful way across the  debris, Kaydessa obeying his guidance in turn. Then they were on a  sloping downward way which led to a staircase--the treads weather-worn  and crumbling, the angle so steep Travis wondered if it had ever been  intended for beings with a physique approximating the Terrans'.    They came to a cleft where an arch of stone was chiseled out as a  roofing. Travis thought he could make out a trace of carving on the  capstone, so worn by years and weather that it was now only a faint  shadow of design.    The cleft was a door into another valley. Here, too, golden mist swirled  in tendrils to disguise and cloak what stood there. Travis had found his  ruins. Only the structures were intact, not breached by time.    Mist flowed in lapping tongues back and forth, confusing outlines, now  shuttering, now baring oval windows which were spaced in diamonds of  four on round tower surfaces. There were no visible cracks, no cloaking  of climbing vegetation, nothing to suggest age and long roots in the  valley. Nor did the architecture he could view match any he had seen on  those other worlds.    Travis strode away from the cleft doorway. Under his moccasins was a  block pavement, yellow and green stone set in a simple pattern of  checks. This, too, was level, unchipped and undisturbed, save for a  drift or two of soil driven in by the wind. And nowhere could he see any  vegetation.    The towers were of the same green stone as half the pavement blocks, a  glassy green which made him think of jade--if jade could be mined in  such quantities as these five-story towers demanded.    Nalik'ideyu padded to him, and he could hear the faint click of her  claws on the pavement. There was a deep silence in this place, as if the  air itself swallowed and digested all sound. The wind which had been  with them all the day of their journeying was left beyond the cleft.    Yet there was life here. The coyote told him that in her own way. She  had not made up her mind concerning that life--wariness and curiosity  warred in her now as her pointed muzzle lifted toward the windows  overhead.    The"]]]
