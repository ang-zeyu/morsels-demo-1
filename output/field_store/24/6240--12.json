The powders thus obtained keep for a long time. The white of eggs, so  prepared, is used for the purposes to which albumen is applied in  the industrial arts, while the powdered yolks are used for domestic  purposes.           *       *       *       *       *          CHARACTERISTICS OF AMERICAN SHEEP HUSBANDRY.      Dr. Hayes, in his recent address before the National Agricultural  Congress, remarking that a very inadequate idea is given of a nation's  resources by the number of sheep raised--the character of the animals  being of the first consideration--proceeds to show some of the  characteristics of American sheep husbandry. He states that the sheep  of the United States consist, first, of what are called native sheep;  second, descendants from improved English races; third, the Mexican  sheep found in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, and California; fourth,  the merino sheep, and crosses of that breed with the three preceding  races. The merinos constitute the principal and characteristic race  of the United States; and this is the most important fact in the  enumeration of our resources for sheep husbandry and the wool  manufacture. England has no merinos, except in her colonies; Russia  has but 12,000,000 merinos; France, but 9,000,000. The merinos and  grades in the United States exceed 25,000,000. Merino wool is for  clothing what wheat is for food; it is the chief material for cloth  at the present day, the coarsest as well as the finest. While the  softest, it is the strongest of all fibers. From its fulling  and spinning qualities, it is the best adhesive for the cheap  fabrics--coarser wool, cotton, or shoddy; the mixture of merino wool  increasing indefinitely the material for cheap clothing. An abundance  of merino wool is the greatest boon the world has received from the  animal kingdom in the last century. It is, in fact, in its extended  culture the product of the last century. A century ago all the merinos  in the world, confined exclusively to Spain, did not number 1,000,000.  1765 marks the epoch of the first exportation of the merinos to  Saxony; 1786, to France; 1833, to Australia; 1802, the introduction  of the first merino sheep to this country; and to Gen. Humphreys, of  Connecticut, and to the introduction to his farm of twenty-one rams  and seventy ewes, may be directly traced the most celebrated breeds  of the American merino; producing individuals actually sold for $5,000  each, others for $2,000 to $3,000, and one for which $10,000 was  refused. The fiber of the merino sheep is not the only excellence of  the animal; when properly bred, this race has a hardiness surpassing  all other high-bred races. The \"yolk,\" provided by nature to assist in  the growth of the wool, abounding in this race more than in any  other, causes the tips of the fleece to be cemented, and to become  impenetrable to rains and snows. A lighter pasture suffices for their  maintenance than would support the mutton races. This race is fitted,  above all others, for the remote pastoral lands and for culture on a  large scale.    Our breeders, in aiming to increase the weight of their fleece, have  developed the length of the staple, and have unconsciously created  a merino combing wool--a wool in special demand through modern  improvements in machinery and changes in the fashion of goods. Mr.  Ferneau, an eminent Belgian wool manufacturer, who has thoroughly  studied our wool resources and manufactures, says that three quarters  of the American wool is \"combing wool,\" and will be ultimately  employed for this purpose. The bulk of American merino wools is of  strong, sound, and healthy staple, having few weak spots in them.  Those from the other States of the West are free from burrs. Those  from California have this defect in a high degree. They are admirably  fitted for blankets, flannels, and fancy cassimeres, and the great  bulk of our card wool manufactures. They are so excellent, as a whole,  that M. Ferneau says they are too valuable to be used for clothing  purposes. They supply nine tenths of all the card or clothing wool  consumed in American mills.           *       *       *       *       *          THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE IN MEXICO.      Mexico, the land of so many and such frequent revolutions, and the  scene of such intestinal commotions and bitter strife through the  whole period of her existence, from the Spanish conquest up to within  a few years, is at present happily in a state of comparative peace  and quiet; the laws are less disregarded, brigandage is gradually  disappearing, more attention is being paid to the protection of life  and property, and public education is in a prosperous condition. No  greater evidence of this felicitous state of affairs could be afforded  than that shown in the display of energy and zeal with which the  present administration, aided by the foremost Mexican scientists,  is carrying out an extended system of scientific explorations,  investigations, and internal improvements; and the progress of which  is being recorded in a valuable series of government publications;  one of these--the _Annals of the Minister of Public Works_--being  now before us. This volume, the third of the series, begins with  an article by the able director of the National Meteorological  Observatory, Sr. Mariano Barcena, calling attention, in the first  place, to the great national importance, as well as necessity, of a  well organized system of meteorological observations; (2) giving a  description of the Mexican Observatory, its equipment, the questions  it proposes to investigate, and the hours of observation; (3)  an explanation, accompanied by charts, of the daily system of  registration pursued at the observatory; and, finally, observations on  the periodic phenomena of vegetation, and notes on the orography  and geology of the valley of Mexico. Sr. A. Anquiano follows with a  communication on the \"Geographical Position of Chalco,\" prefacing  the results of his labors by an able essay on the \"Mexican Method\"  of determining the latitude of places, a \"method\" founded on an  observation of the stars. It would be interesting to quote from this,  but our limited space will not permit. The \"Citlaltepetl Commission,\"  consisting of the engineers, Srs. Plowes, Rodriguez, and Vigil, whose  patriotic ardor induced the minister to commission them to explore  \"and be the first to plant the flag of Mexican science on the snow  clad peak of Citlaltepetl,\" render their report of operations during  the year 1877 in the form of an exceedingly interesting memoir. They  ascertained the peak of the volcano Citlaltepetl (or Orizaba) to be  17,651 feet above the level of the sea, which is 292 feet more  than Humboldt made it. After a somewhat exhaustive treatise on the  \"Telescope and its Amplifying Power,\" by Sr. Jimenez, we have a long  and extremely interesting account of the Ancient Aqueduct of Zempoala,  one of the most notable of existing monuments of the old Spanish rule.  These aqueducts (for there were three) were projected and carried to a  successful termination by an humble and ignorant Franciscan monk--the  Friar Tembleque. The construction of these remarkable works, begun  in 1554 and occupying a period of 17 years, was undertaken for the  purpose of carrying water from Zempoala to Otumba (a distance of  27 miles), and was the occasion of a curious contract between the  inhabitants of these two cities. It seems that Otumba, situated at a  high elevation, needed water; Zempoala was blessed with water, but was  sadly in need of spiritual advisers; the people of the former city,  therefore, agreed to furnish a certain proportion of friars to  minister to the religious wants of the parties of the second part, and  the latter in return bound themselves to furnish water, and the labor  and materials for the building of an aqueduct to lead it, to the  parties of the first part. No tradition remains to state when these  structures ceased to be used. The longest of the three extends across  the valley of the Papelote, a distance of 2,960 feet, and consists  of 68 arches, the highest of which has an altitude of 106 feet. Senor  Salazar urges on the Minister of Public Works the importance of having  these monuments of a past age repaired and restored, not alone for  archaeological reasons, but because Otumba to-day is as greatly in  need of running water as it was in that remote period when these  viaducts were constructed. Senor Barcena follows with a description  and colored plate of a plant (_Gaudichaudia Enrico-Martinezii_) new  to the Mexican flora, and Sr. Federico Weidner with some \"General  Reflections on the Iron Industry of the Country.\" Succeeding the  latter paper, an exhaustive article by the same writer gives us,  from a geological point of view, the structure, as far as can be  ascertained, of the \"Cerro de Mercado\" of Durango, which is said to be  one vast mass of iron. The author after a thorough examination of this  hill, last year, concludes that it is of eruptive or volcanic origin.  This is contrary to the statements made in most published works,  the authors of which probably derived their notions from the views  expressed by Humboldt, who was of the opinion that this mass of iron  was an immense aerolite. Sr. Weidner, however, concludes that the  great traveler never visited the locality in person, but obtained his  information from heresay. He shows that the hill is deficient in the  chemical constituents of aerolites, namely, iron, nickel, and cobalt,  in a native or malleable state; but, on the contrary, is made up in a  great measure of crystalline magnetic iron, and various useful oxides  of the same metal. By a careful estimate of the quantity of iron  contained in that portion only of the Cerro which appears above the  surface of the soil, the author obtains as a result the enormous sum  of 507,000,000 pounds, and this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38482"],[0,"Scientific American, Vol. XLIII.â€”No. 1. [New Series.], July 3, 1880 (#13)"],[1,"wheels in the two compartments are arranged at right angles  to each other, has been patented by Mr. William E. Seelye, of Anoka,  Minn.    Mr. Stephen Barnes, of New Haven, Conn., has invented a vibrating  propeller, adapted to small boats and vessels to be operated by either  hand or steam power. The floats are arranged so that they will offer  no resistance on the return stroke.    An improved device for removing snow from railway tracks, and  especially from between the rails, has been patented by Mr. David M.  Horton, of Fishkill Village, N. Y. It consists of a revolving brush, a  mould board in juxtaposition thereto, and a fan blower, in combination  with suitable driving gear for propelling the brush and fan.    An improvement in steam traps, patented by Mr. Hugh O. Ames, of New  Orleans, La., consists in combining with a vibratory arm carrying a  water receiver, a side apertured hollow trunnion, a discharge pipe, a  jacketed standard, and an outlet pipe.    An improved cotton press has been patented by Mr. Alfred A. Janney, of  Montgomery, Ala. This invention relates to an improvement in the class  of cotton and hay presses in which the follower is worked by a screw  that passes through a nut, to which the required rotary motion is  imparted by means of lateral sweeps or levers. It consists in the  means for supporting and securing the levers and forming a vertical  guide for the screw, so that the levers are prevented from rocking or  swaying as power is applied in the operation of packing.           *       *       *       *       *          IMPROVED STEAM CANAL BOAT.    The late experiments in canal steamboats bid fair to be a complete  success. The Baxter steamers were not sufficiently remunerative  to continue the building of that kind of boat. They do not carry a  sufficient load, owing to their build, and that is made necessary by  the form and arrangement of the machinery and propelling power, the  propeller being that form used by the tug in Buffalo. The new style,  which bids to pay handsomely, is as full a bow and stern as the  ordinary first-class canal boat. The propelling power is radically  different from the tug propeller. The wheel is eight feet in diameter  and placed close to the stern; the boiler is upright, with a single  engine, very compact machinery, taking up no more room than the stable  in many boats, and enabling the boat to carry 7,500 bushels of corn  and coal for the trip. With this cargo they run from Buffalo to New  York in seven days on five and a half gross tons of coal, saving river  and harbor towing. One returned from New York to Buffalo in one hour  less than seven days, bringing one hundred and thirty tons of freight.  The outlook now promises to supersede mule and horse towing. The  Belgian system of cable towing will take that large number of boats  now relying on the mule, and deliver them promptly as consigned and in  much less time and cost than can be done by the mule. Both systems are  necessary for rapid movement on the canal, and to cheapen the transfer  from the West to the seaboard. Steam is sure to supersede animal power  on the canal, as everywhere else. The canal steamboats are at last so  far perfected as to insure a handsome profit in running them, and  a large number will soon be at work on the canal. Two are to be  constructed in Lockport as speedily as possible by one of our most  enterprising boat builders, and the machinery is contracted for,  thus opening up a new industry for our numerous and worthy  mechanics.--_Lockport_ (_N.

The computations in the following notes are by students of Vassar  College. Although merely approximate, they are sufficiently accurate  to enable the ordinary observer to find the planets.    M. M.      POSITIONS OF PLANETS FOR JULY, 1880.      MERCURY.    On July 1 Mercury sets a few minutes after 9 in the evening.    Mercury can be readily found, early in July, a few degrees south of  the point of sunset; the planet moves rapidly southward, but can be  followed, and may be seen as late as the 20th. On July 18 Mercury has  nearly the declination of Regulus.      VENUS.    Venus keeps nearly the path of the sun, setting after the sun late in  July, but so nearly with it that the planet is not likely to be seen.      MARS.    Mars has moved from its position nearly in line with Castor and Pollux  toward Leo. It sets on July 1 at 9h. 44m. P.M. On the 31st Mars sets  at 8h. 32m.    On the 31st, at meridian passage, Mars and Uranus are nearly together.  Uranus is east of Mars and half a degree south.      JUPITER.    Jupiter is coming into the evening hours.    On July 1 Jupiter rises a few minutes after midnight. On July 31  Jupiter rises a few minutes after 10 P.M. It will be known at once by  its brilliancy.    Besides the ordinary belts of Jupiter the planet still shows at this  time (June 10) the large ruddy spot spoken of by many persons some  weeks since. This spot is elliptical in shape; its longest diameter is  about one-fifth that of Jupiter. A small glass will show it, and the  ordinary observer can, by watching its appearance and disappearance  and reappearance, determine the time of rotation of Jupiter on its  axis, or the length of the planet's day.    The best evenings for looking at Jupiter are those of July 23, when  the satellite nearest to Jupiter goes across its face, preceded by  its shadow; July 28, when the first and second satellites will make  similar transits; and July 29, when Jupiter will rise without the  presence of its third satellite, which will be in eclipse, and will  come out of the shadow after midnight.      SATURN.    Saturn follows close upon Jupiter, but keeps further north in  declination by about 21/2 deg..    On July 1 Saturn rises 36m. after midnight. On the 31st Saturn rises  at 10h. 38m. P.M.    The waning moon will pass north of Jupiter and Saturn on the 27th to  28th.    Any one who has a glass sufficient to show the ring of Saturn and the  largest satellite, Titan, will find this planet intensely interesting,  and the movements of the satellite will show the time of its  revolution in its orbit around Saturn.      URANUS.    Uranus rises after the sun, and sets too nearly with the sun to be  seen.      NEPTUNE.    Neptune may be seen, with a good telescope, in the early morning hour.  Neptune is 21/4 deg. west of Alpha Ceti, and 11 deg. north. It approaches Alpha  Ceti during the month, and if it can be found, may be known to be a  planet by that movement.           *       *       *       *       *          FIRES IN NEW YORK.    The report of the Board of Fire Commissioners, just printed, shows  that during the year 1879 there were in this city 1,551 fires, of  which 1,029 were discovered by persons not connected with the Fire  or Police Department. In 1,456 cases the fires were confined to the  buildings in which they originated. Twenty-five buildings were totally  destroyed, and 69 were greatly damaged. Of all the fires, 1,001 were  extinguished by buckets of water and fire extinguishers. The total  estimated loss by fire during the year was $900,280 on buildings  and $4,771,300 on stock, making a total of $5,671,580. The  estimated insurances on the buildings were $7,276,446, and on stock,  $14,525,264, making a total of $21,801,710. The estimated uninsured  loss was $180,060. In three cases the loss was between $100,000 and  $115,000; in one case $168,908; in one case $352,185; in one case  $333,900; and in one case $1,978,991. In 1,066 cases the loss was less  than $100.    Nearly a quarter of all the fires were caused by carelessness, and 100  are attributed to children playing with matches and fire. Forty fires  were caused by the spontaneous combustion of oily rags and other  materials, and 93 by exploding kerosene lamps. Four members of the  department and 12 citizens died of injuries received at fires during  the year, and 139 firemen and 54 citizens were more or less injured.    There are 729 uniformed members of the department The pay roll of the  whole department for 1879 was $1,030,822.14, and the appropriation for  all expenses was $1,254,970. The appropriation for the present year  is $1,307,670. The department now possesses 233 horses, 1 marine steam  fire engine, 58 steam fire engines, of which 5 are self propelling,  10 chemical engines, 24 hook and ladder trucks, 108 chemical fire  extinguishers, and 4 aerial ladders, together with other fire  apparatus.    The annual inspection of the department showed that the quickest  average time in hitching a team was 3.17 seconds, and in hitching  a single horse, 5.66 seconds. The general average in hitching all  apparatus was, in 1879, 9.54 seconds; in 1878, 10.26 seconds; and in  1877, 13.03 seconds.    During the year, $30,300 was collected for licenses for the sale of  kerosene oil, each license costing $10. The Fire Department Relief  Fund now amounts to $422,569.07, and the insurance fund to $12,780.           *       *       *       *       *          ASPIRATOR AND COMPRESSOR.    Professor Marangoni, of Pavia, has invented an aspirator for measuring  gases which is much simpler than many now in use in laboratories,  which latter have the defect that the air or gas ascends through  the descending liquid and makes thus the measuring of the former  uncertain. The improved apparatus is shown in our illustration. It  consists of two vessels attached to a fixed horizontal shaft, FE,  which is placed upon two upright supports. This shaft has several ways  or passages made in it which performs the functions of the taps.  The water of the upper receptacle passes into the lower one by the  passage, A, and thence through the tube, BC, issuing at its lowest  extremity at C. The air contained in the lower vessel is thus emitted  by the channel DE, cut into the shaft, while the air or"]]]
