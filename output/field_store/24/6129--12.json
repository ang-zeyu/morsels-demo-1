Case 7, Figs. 13, 14_              In July, after nesting, the male molts into a            plumage resembling that of the female, when both            are known as Reedbird. L 7-1/4.              _Range._ Nests from northern New Jersey and            northern Missouri to southern Canada and westward            to British Columbia; leaves the United States            through Florida and winters chiefly in            northwestern Argentina; returns to United States            early in April.

A bird with a dual personality; welcome minstrel of the meadows when  nesting, dread scourge of the rice-fields when traveling. With the loss  of his trim suit of black, white, and buff, Bob loses also his merry  tinkling, rippling song, and acquires with his streaked Reedbird suit a  single watchword. _Tink, tink_ he calls from somewhere overhead, and  _tink, tink_ his comrades answer as they follow a trackless path through  the sky on their 5000-mile journey.    The nest is placed on the ground and 4-7 grayish, blotched eggs are laid  late in May or early in June.      COWBIRD    _Molothrus ater ater. Case 5, Figs. 8, 9_              The male's brown head distinguishes him from other            Blackbirds; the female wears a dull gray garb well            designed to make her inconspicuous. L. 8.              _Range._ North America; nesting from North            Carolina and Louisiana to Canada; winters from            Virginia and Ohio southward.              Washington, rather rare P.R., common T.V.            Ossining, common S.R., Mch. 23-Nov. 11.            Cambridge, common S.R., Mch. 25-Nov. 1; occasional            in winter. N.

Outlaws among birds, they pair not neither do they build. Without moral  standards or maternal instincts the female accepts the attention of any  male that chances to win her fancy and deposits her eggs in the nests of  other birds. She is a slacker and a shirker, who keeps much in the  background during the breeding season. Color, habit, his sliding, glassy  whistle, and guttural gurgling, make the male conspicuous. Leaving the  care of their foster parents the young join others of their kind and  flock in the grainfields or about cattle in the pastures.      YELLOW-HEADED BLACKBIRD    _Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus. Case 6, Fig. 45_              Large size and a yellow head distinguish the male;            the female is duller, the body brownish, the head            yellowish. L. 10.              _Range._ Mississippi Valley and westward, breeding            from northern Illinois northward to Canada;            winters from the west Gulf coast and southern            California into Mexico; accidental east of the            Alleghanies.              Washington, A.V., one instance, Aug. Cambridge,            A.V., one record, Oct. Glen Ellyn, A.V., May 21,            1898. SE. Minn., common S.R., Apl. 21.    Hanging their cradle nest in the quill-reeds or rushes, the Yellow-heads  are not found far from it until the young take wing. The male entertains  his mate with a variety of strange calls and whistles, but leaves to her  the hatching of the brown speckled eggs and care of the young while they  are in the nest. Like other Blackbirds they migrate and winter in  flocks.      RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD    _Agelaius phoeniceus phoeniceus. Case 5, Figs. 5, 6_              The male in spring and early summer is            unmistakable; in winter his feathers are tipped            with brownish, more pronounced in the young. The            streaked females require closer scrutiny. L.            9-1/2.              _Range._ Eastern North America, nests from Florida            to Canada; winters from Maryland southward,            sometimes farther north. The Florida Red-wing (_A.            p. floridanus_, Case 4, Figs. 28, 29) is smaller            and with a slenderer bill. It inhabits Florida            (except the southeast coast and Keys) and ranges            west along the Gulf coast to Texas. The Bahama            Red-wing (_A. p. bahamensis_) is still smaller. It            is resident in southeastern Florida, the Keys and            Bahamas.              Washington, common P.R., abundant in migration.            Ossining, common S.R., Feb. 25-Nov. 11. Cambridge,            abundant S.R., Mch. 10-Aug. 30; a few winter. N.            Ohio, abundant S.R., Mch. 1-Nov. 15. Glen Ellyn,            common S.R., Mch. 5-Nov. 19. SE. Minn., common            S.R., Mch. 8-Nov. 14.    The Red-wing's mellow _kong-quer-reee_ is as certain an indication of  the presence of water as is the piping of frogs in the spring. It may be  only a bit of boggy marshland, it may be a reedy lakeside, but water  there will surely be. On a frequented perch he half spreads his wings,  fluffs out his scarlet epaulets, bursting into bloom, as it were, when  he utters his notes--a singing flower! The nest is in the alders,  button-bushes, or reeds, or even on the ground, and although the birds  come in March, their pale blue, spotted, blotched, and scrawled eggs are  not laid until May. Except when nesting, Red-wings live in flocks.      MEADOWLARK    _Sturnella magna magna. Case 2, Fig. 23_              A large, quail-like bird which shows white outer            tail-feathers when it flies; if one can obtain a            front view, the yellow underparts and black            breast-crescent are conspicuous. L. 10-3/4.              _Range._ Eastern North America, rare west of the            Mississippi; nesting from North Carolina and            Missouri to Canada; winters from southern New            England and northern Ohio southward. The Southern            Meadowlark (_S. m. argutula_, Case, 4, Fig. 79) is            smaller and darker. It is resident in the south            Atlantic and Gulf States.              Washington, common P.R., less common in winter.            Ossining, tolerably common S.R., Feb. 20-Nov. 27;            a few winter. Cambridge, common S.R., not common            W.V. N. Ohio, abundant S.R., Mch. 5-Nov. 15; a            few winter. Glen Ellyn, common S.R., Jan. 24-Nov.            15; irregular W.V. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch.            25-Oct. 15; rare W.V.    The Meadowlark is a fifer of the fields, whose high, clear whistle is  one of the most welcome bird songs of early spring. In May, when  nesting, it often sings an ecstatic twittering warble on the wing. The  alarm calls are an unmusical _dzit_ or _yert_ and a string of beady,  metallic notes.    The nest is placed on the ground. The 4-6 eggs are white, speckled with  brown.      WESTERN MEADOWLARK    _Sturnella neglecta_              Grayer than the Eastern Meadowlark, with            disconnected tail-bars and yellow spreading to the            sides of the throat.              _Range._ Western United States, rare east of the            Mississippi. SE. Minn., common S.R., Mch. 25-Oct.            15.    With the general appearance and habits of the Eastern Meadowlark, but  differing in its call-notes and song. Instead of the sharp _dzit_ or  _yert_ and metallic twitter of the eastern bird, the western species  calls _chuck_, _chuck_, followed by a rolling _b-r-r-r-_. The eastern  bird plays the fife but the western uses the flute, and its bubbling  grace-notes are easily distinguishable from the _straight_ whistling of  its eastern cousin.      ORCHARD ORIOLE    _Icterus spurius. Case 7, Figs. 10-12_              Adult males are unmistakable, but females and            young males in their first fall wear a            non-committal costume and must be looked at            sharply. In their first nesting season, young            males resemble the female but have a black throat.            This is a smaller, more slender bird than the            Baltimore Oriole, and the female is less orange.            L. 7-1/4.              _Range._ Eastern United States, nesting from the            Gulf States to Massachusetts and Minnesota;            winters in the tropics.              Washington, common S.R., Apl. 20-Aug. 22.            Ossining, common S.R., May 2-Aug. 6. Cambridge,            S.R., sometimes rather common, May 15-July. N.            Ohio, common S.R., Apl. 28-Sept. 5. Glen Ellyn,            not common S.R., Apl. 38. SE. Minn., uncommon            S.R., May 10-Aug. 26.    In the northern part of its range, the Orchard Oriole is somewhat less  common, and more local than the Baltimore Oriole, while its duller  colors and more retiring habits make it more difficult to see. The voice  is richer, more cultured--if one may use the term--than that of its  brilliant orange-plumed cousin; indeed, in my opinion, this species  deserves a place in the first rank of our songsters. The nest of finely  woven grasses is not so deep as that of the Baltimore. Three to five  bluish white eggs, spotted and scrawled with black, are laid the latter  part of May.      BALTIMORE ORIOLE    _Icterus galbula. Case 7, Figs. 8, 9_              The orange and black male needs no introduction;            the female is tinted with orange strongly enough            to show her relationship. L. 7-1/2.              _Range._ Eastern North America; nests from            northern Georgia to Canada; winters in the            tropics.              Washington, rather common S.R., Apl. 29-Aug. 26.            Ossining, common S.R., May 2-Sept. 1. Cambridge,            very common S.R., May 8 through Aug. N.

A long-haired mastiff was kept chained as a watch-dog,  and when a white fantail pigeon's mate died, it attached itself to the  mastiff, and was continually with it in the kennel. When the dog had its  breakfast of porridge and milk, the pigeon would eat out of the bowl at  the same time; and when the dog had finished, it would lie flat on its  side while the pigeon perched on its head and pecked off the grains of  oatmeal that stuck to the long hair round its mouth. The only danger to  the pigeon seemed to be that when the dog rushed out of the kennel  suddenly to bark, it seemed to forget the pigeon, and we used to fear  that the heavy chain might hurt it; but it never was hurt. This  friendship lasted many years, till one of the two, I forget which, died.              ISABEL JAMISON.      DOG AND KITTENS.              [_July 1, 1893._]    The following story may, perhaps, interest some of your readers:--Willie  is a small, rough-haired terrier, a truculent and aggressive character,  the terror of tramps, in a skirmish with one of whom he has lost an  eye. He rules the kitchen with a rod of iron, the inmate there admiring  and fearing him. Next to tramps, Willie hates cats; he has been flogged  again and again for chasing the neighbour's \"Tom\"; nothing can stop him  rushing at the alien cat, however. But for his own domestic \"Tabby\" he  has tolerance and a certain amount of affection; if another dog were to  attack her, dire would be the warfare. A while ago, this cat had three  kittens; two were taken by the maid and placed in a bucket of water, and  left to their fate. Before that fate had come Willie perceived them; he  snatched them from the bucket one by one, and carried them to his  kennel. The maid attempted to get them away, but Willie flew at her with  fury, and then returned to lick first one and then the other, to shove  them up together, and lie down near them, and in every way to give the  poor half-dead things a chance. This went on for some time; but when at  last there was no sign of breath, and he saw that they were hopelessly  dead, he marched out of the kennel, shook himself, and indicated to the  maid that she might now proceed to bury them, that they were past  intelligent treatment. He treats the remaining and living kitten with  the indifference of the scientific for the normal.              L. H.      A CANINE NURSE.              [_May 18, 1895._]    Being a frequent reader of anecdotes of the sagacity of animals in your  paper, I think you may consider the following trait of character in a  dog worthy of notice. Jack, a rough-haired fox-terrier of quiet  disposition, but a good ratter, and an inveterate enemy to strange or  neighbouring cats, of whom, to my sorrow, he has slain at least one,  became without effort the attached friend of a minute kitten introduced  into the house last November. This friendship has been continued without  intermission, and is reciprocated by the now full-grown cat. She,  unfortunately, got caught in a rabbit-trap not long ago, but escaped  with no further injury than a lacerated paw, which for some time caused  her much pain and annoyance. Every morning Jack was to be seen tenderly  licking the paw of the interesting invalid, to which kind nursing no  doubt her rapid recovery may be attributed; and though she is now more  than convalescent and able to enjoy her usual game of play, he still  greets her each morning with a gentle inquiring lick on the injured paw,  just to see if it is all right, before proceeding to roll her over in  their accustomed gambols. This seems to me a marked instance of  individual affection overcoming race-antipathy.              BLANCHE ROCHFORT.      A CURIOUS FRIENDSHIP.              [_Feb. 6, 1875._]    I have two dogs, two cats, and a kitten. Many years of experience have  shown me, in the teeth of all proverbs, that cats and dogs, members of  the same household, live together quite as amicably as human beings.    Only, like human beings, they have their dislikes and preferences for  each other. At the present time, my dog Snow is on terms of hearty  friendship with my grey cat Kitty, but of polite indifference with my  black cat Toppy.    Toppy, for some years back, has been subject to fits, owing, it is  considered, to the lodgment of some small shot near her spine, whilst  out trespassing (or poaching).    Yesterday Snow rushed into the kitchen with face so anxious and piteous  that my servants both exclaimed that something must have happened; gave  signs, as he can do, that somebody was to go with him, and was followed  into the drawing-room, where Toppy, left alone, had fallen under the  grate in a fit, and was writhing amid the ashes and embers. She was  rescued, and beyond a little singeing, does not seem much the worse.    To reach the kitchen, Snow must have pushed open a red-baize door, which  he has never been known to open before, and before which he will stay  barking for ten minutes at a time to be let through.    If any biped, supposing himself to be endowed with reason, humanity, and  articulate speech, tells me that Snow is a conscious automaton, can I  give him any other answer than, \"You're another\"?              J. M. L.      AN ACT OF CANINE FRIENDSHIP.              [_Nov. 6, 1880._]    I have read from time to time in the pages of the _Spectator_ instances  of canine sagacity furnished by your correspondents, which have, no  doubt, interested many others besides myself. The following incident  occurred last Saturday, in my walk from the beach, which, perhaps, may  amuse your readers, as it did me.    My curiosity was excited by seeing a young retriever on his hind legs  licking very ardently the face of a nice-looking donkey, who was  tethered on the bank. After licking his face all over for a long time,  he began to frisk around him, evidently anxious to have a trot together;  but, finding that his friend was tied by a rope, he deliberately began  to gnaw it, and in a very short time succeeded in setting him free! The  owner of the donkey, who happened to be at work close by, then  interfered, and put a stop to their little game, or otherwise Master  Neddy would, no doubt, have been seduced to join in a scamper. From the  warmth of the dog's salutes, I imagine that he and the donkey were old  friends.              S. RICHARDS.      DOG AND CANARY.              [_Nov. 20, 1880._]    I was much interested in the account of the friendship that existed  between the young retriever and the donkey whom he released by gnawing  the rope. The little incident I send of another retriever may also  interest your readers. A friend of mine had a pet canary, while her  brother was the owner of a retriever that was also much petted. One day  the canary escaped from the house, and was seen flying about the grounds  for a few days, and when it perched was generally on high elm-trees. At  last it vanished from view, and this dear little pet was mourned for as  lost or dead. But after the interval of another day or so, the  retriever came in with the canary in his mouth, carrying it most  delicately, and went up to the owner of the bird, delivering it into her  hands without even the feathers being injured. Surely nothing could  illustrate more beautifully faithful love and gentleness in a dog than  this.              E. TILL.      CAT-AND-DOG LOVE.              [_April 13, 1878._]    Would you allow me, as a cat fancier of nearly thirty years' standing,  to corroborate, by a personal experience, Mr. Balfour's testimony in  your last issue to the possibility of a genuine attachment between a cat  and a dog? A few weeks ago, I called upon a bachelor friend who has two  pets, a handsome black female cat, of the name of Kate, and a bright  little terrier, responding to the call of David. My friend assured me  that they lived on the most affectionate terms. They were certainly not  demonstrative, but they were importations from Scotland, and refrained  from \"spooning\" before folk. The character of the attachment was soon  tested. Another acquaintance entered the room, accompanied by a terrier  of about the same size as David, although not of the same variety. This  dog made at once for the cat, then resting in front of the fire. She  backed against the wall, and prepared for a fight, in which, if I may  judge from her size, she would have been victorious. But she was saved  the trouble of using her claws. Before she could utter a feline  equivalent for \"Jack Robinson,\" before the door could be closed, David  rushed at the intruder, and literally ran him out of the room and down  two flights of stairs, with a rapidity worthy of a member of the Irish  Constabulary. By the time he returned, his Dulcinea had arranged herself  for another nap, but she opened one eye as her companion took his place  by his side, and--        \"Betwixt her darkness and his brightness,      There passed a mutual glance of great politeness.\"    I witnessed a similar scene some years ago in a country inn in the north  of Scotland. On that occasion, one dog defended against another a  favourite cat and a favourite hen.    Speaking of cats, can any one say what has become of the late Pope's  black cat, Morello? Did he die before his master, or has some one  adopted him? Chateaubriand, as everybody knows, adopted Micetto, the  grey favourite of Leo XII.

[_Feb. 2, 1895._]    Knowing your love of animals, and the interest so often shown in your  columns in their ways, I venture to send you the following story I have  lately heard from an eye-witness, and to ask whether you or any of your  readers can throw any light upon the dog's probable object.
