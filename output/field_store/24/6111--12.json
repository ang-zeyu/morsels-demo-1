The length of time which a muscle may remain contracted, varies.  The duration of the contraction of the voluntary muscles, in some  measure, is in an inverse ratio to its force. If a muscle has  contracted with violence, as when great effort is made to raise a  heavy weight, relaxation will follow sooner than when the contraction  has been less powerful, as in raising light bodies.    166. The velocity of the muscular contraction depends on the will.  Many of the voluntary muscles in man contract with great rapidity, so  that he is enabled to utter distinctly fifteen hundred letters in a  minute; the pronunciation of each letter requiring both relaxation and  contraction of the same muscle, thus making three thousand actions in  one minute. But the contraction of the muscles of some of the inferior  animals surpasses in rapidity those of man. The race-horse, it is  said, has run a mile in a minute; and many birds of prey will probably  pass not less than a thousand miles daily.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    Give experiment 2d. 164. With what is each muscular fibre supplied?  What effect has this stimulus on the muscles? 165. how long does a  voluntary muscle remain contracted? 166. On what is the velocity of  muscular contraction dependent? How many letters may be pronounced in  a minute?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    167. The functions of the involuntary muscles are necessary the  digestion of food, the absorption and circulation of the nutritive  fluids. They could not be trusted with safety to the control of the  will, lest the passions or the indiscretions of the person should  continually avert those operations so necessary to health, and even to  life. The Divine Builder of this complicated machine has wisely  ordered that the muscles upon which these motions depend, shall act  under the impression of their proper stimulants, without the control  of the individual.    168. Again, there are certain operations which could not be safely  intrusted to the absolute government of the voluntary muscles, or  entirely removed from their control. Thus life can be supported only a  few minutes without breathing; but it would be impossible to perform  the daily vocations of life if we were compelled to breathe at all  times, or at perfectly regular intervals.    169. It has been observed that, among men of the same size, a wide  difference exists in their strength and activity--qualities which  depend upon the size and number of the nerves, the size and activity  of the brain, and the education, or training of the muscles. Men  having large nerves leading to the muscles, with the brain active,  and muscles well trained will perform feats of strength and agility,  that other men, of the same size, cannot effect. Rope-dancers,  harlequins, and other performers of feats, are persons thus  constituted.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    How many contractions and relaxations of the same muscle? What is said  of the rapidity of muscular contractions in other animals? 167. When  are the involuntary muscles called into action? Why would it not have  been safe to trust these important operations to the exclusive control  of the will? 168. Give an instance where some of the muscles act under  the government of the will, conjoined with those that are involuntary.  169. On what does the difference in muscular activity and strength  depend?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    170. Persons with small muscles, and largely developed nervous  systems, will sometimes exhibit very great muscular power for a time;  but it will not be of long continuance, unless the brain is  functionally diseased, as in hysteria, delirium of fever, insanity,  &c. Men of large muscles and small nerves can never perform feats of  great strength; but they have the power of endurance, and are better  capacitated for continued labor. Thus we cannot judge of the ability  of persons to make exertions and continue them, by their stature  alone. Strength, and the power of endurance, are the result of a  combination of well-developed muscles, large nerves, and a full-sized,  healthy, and active brain.    _Observation._ The muscles of fishes are large, and the nerves  distributed to them, comparatively small. The muscles of birds are  small, but their fibres are very compact. The nerves appropriated to  the muscles that are called into action in flying, are large as well  as numerous.    171. The contractile portion of a muscle is, in general, at a distance  from the part to be moved. Thus the principal muscles that move the  fingers are situated upon the forearm; and when the limb is nearly or  quite extended, the angle formed by the part to be moved and the  contractile muscles is small. Again, the attachment of the muscles to  the part to be moved is near the joint that forms the fulcrum, (fig.  45.) By these arrangements there is a loss of power; but we are  compensated for this disadvantage by increased celerity of movement,  beauty of form, and adaptation of the limbs to the varied pursuits of  man.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    170. What is said of those persons who have small muscles and largely  developed nervous systems? Of those who have large muscles and small  nerves? Upon what do strength and the power of endurance depend? 171.  Why is there a loss of power in the action of the muscles?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    _Illustration._ The muscle that bends the elbow acts at disadvantage,  and this is greatest when the arm is nearly or quite extended, as the  angle of action is then least. This disadvantage is further increased  by the attachment of the motive muscles near the joint.    172. The number of muscles which are called into action in the  movements of the different joints, varies. The hinge-joints, as the  elbow, have two sets of muscles--one to bend the joint, the other to  extend it. The ball and socket joints, as the shoulder, are not  limited to mere flexion and extension. No joint in the system has the  range of movement that is possessed by that of the shoulder. By the  action of the muscles attached to the arm, it is not only carried  upward and forward, but forward and backward. Hence the arm may be  moved at any angle, by a combined action of its muscles.    _Observation._ \"Could we behold properly the muscular fibres in  operation, nothing, as a mere mechanical exhibition, can be conceived  more superb than the intricate and combined actions that must take  place during our most common movements. Look at a person running or  leaping, or watch the motions of the eye. How rapid, how delicate, how  complicated, and yet how accurate, are the motions required! Think of  the endurance of such a muscle as the heart, that can contract, with a  force equal to sixty pounds, seventy-five times every minute, for  eighty years together, without being weary.\"    _Note._ It would be a profitable exercise for pupils to press their  fingers upon prominent muscles, and, at the same time, vigorously  contract them, not only to learn their situations, but their use; as  the one that bends the arm, 14, fig. 46.      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    How is this illustrated? 172. Do all joints require the same number of  muscles, when called into action? How many are called into action in  the movement of the elbow? What is their office? What is said of the  movement of the ball and socket joint?      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=    [Illustration: Fig. 46. An anterior view of the muscles of the body. 1.

Therefore I say, since I am but a thrall, poor and helpless, betwixt you  two mighty ones, I have no choice but to do thy will.\"    As she spoke she looked all round about her, as one distraught by the  anguish of fear.  Walter, amidst of his wrath and grief, had wellnigh  drawn his sword and rushed out of his lair upon the King's Son.  But he  deemed it sure that, so doing, he should undo the Maid altogether, and  himself also belike, so he refrained him, though it were a hard matter.    The Maid had stayed her feet now close to where Walter lay, some five  yards from him only, and he doubted whether she saw him not from where  she stood.  As to the King's Son, he was so intent upon the Maid, and so  greedy of her beauty, that it was not like that he saw anything.    Now moreover Walter looked, and deemed that he beheld something through  the grass and bracken on the other side of those two, an ugly brown and  yellow body, which, if it were not some beast of the foumart kind, must  needs be the monstrous dwarf, or one of his kin; and the flesh crept upon  Walter's bones with the horror of him.  But the King's Son spoke unto the  Maid: \"Sweetling, I shall take the gift thou givest me, neither shall I  threaten thee any more, howbeit thou givest it not very gladly or  graciously.\"    She smiled on him with her lips alone, for her eyes were wandering and  haggard.  \"My lord,\" she said, \"is not this the manner of women?\"    \"Well,\" he said, \"I say that I will take thy love even so given.  Yet let  me hear again that thou lovest not that vile newcomer, and that thou hast  not seen him, save this morning along with my Lady.  Nay now, thou shalt  swear it.\"    \"What shall I swear by?\" she said.    Quoth he, \"Thou shalt swear by my body;\" and therewith he thrust himself  close up against her; but she drew her hand from his, and laid it on his  breast, and said: \"I swear it by thy body.\"    He smiled on her licorously, and took her by the shoulders, and kissed  her face many times, and then stood aloof from her, and said: \"Now have I  had hansel: but tell me, when shall I come to thee?\"    She spoke out clearly: \"Within three days at furthest; I will do thee to  wit of the day and the hour to-morrow, or the day after.\"    He kissed her once more, and said: \"Forget it not, or the threat holds  good.\"    And therewith he turned about and went his ways toward the house; and  Walter saw the yellow-brown thing creeping after him in the gathering  dusk.    As for the Maid, she stood for a while without moving, and looking after  the King's Son and the creature that followed him.  Then she turned about  to where Walter lay and lightly put aside the boughs, and Walter leapt  up, and they stood face to face.  She said softly but eagerly: \"Friend,  touch me not yet!\"    He spake not, but looked on her sternly.  She said: \"Thou art angry with  me?\"    Still he spake not; but she said: \"Friend, this at least I will pray  thee; not to play with life and death; with happiness and misery.  Dost  thou not remember the oath which we swore each to each but a little while  ago?  And dost thou deem that I have changed in these few days?  Is thy  mind concerning thee and me the same as it was?  If it be not so, now  tell me.  For now have I the mind to do as if neither thou nor I are  changed to each other, whoever may have kissed mine unwilling lips, or  whomsoever thy lips may have kissed.  But if thou hast changed, and wilt  no longer give me thy love, nor crave mine, then shall this steel\" (and  she drew a sharp knife from her girdle) \"be for the fool and the dastard  who hath made thee wroth with me, my friend, and my friend that I deemed  I had won.  And then let come what will come!  But if thou be nought  changed, and the oath yet holds, then, when a little while hath passed,  may we thrust all evil and guile and grief behind us, and long joy shall  lie before us, and long life, and all honour in death: if only thou wilt  do as I bid thee, O my dear, and my friend, and my first friend!\"    He looked on her, and his breast heaved up as all the sweetness of her  kind love took hold on him, and his face changed, and the tears filled  his eyes and ran over, and rained down before her, and he stretched out  his hand toward her.    Then she said exceeding sweetly: \"Now indeed I see that it is well with  me, yea, and with thee also.  A sore pain it is to me, that not even now  may I take thine hand, and cast mine arms about thee, and kiss the lips  that love me.  But so it has to be.  My dear, even so I were fain to  stand here long before thee, even if we spake no more word to each other;  but abiding here is perilous; for there is ever an evil spy upon my  doings, who has now as I deem followed the King's Son to the house, but  who will return when he has tracked him home thither: so we must sunder.  But belike there is yet time for a word or two: first, the rede which I  had thought on for our deliverance is now afoot, though I durst not tell  thee thereof, nor have time thereto.  But this much shall I tell thee,  that whereas great is the craft of my Mistress in wizardry, yet I also  have some little craft therein, and this, which she hath not, to change  the aspect of folk so utterly that they seem other than they verily are;  yea, so that one may have the aspect of another.  Now the next thing is  this: whatsoever my Mistress may bid thee, do her will therein with no  more nay-saying than thou deemest may please her.  And the next thing:  wheresoever thou mayst meet me, speak not to me, make no sign to me, even  when I seem to be all alone, till I stoop down and touch the ring on my  ankle with my right hand; but if I do so, then stay thee, without fail,  till I speak.  The last thing I will say to thee, dear friend, ere we  both go our ways, this it is.  When we are free, and thou knowest all  that I have done, I pray thee deem me not evil and wicked, and be not  wroth with me for my deed; whereas thou wottest well that I am not in  like plight with other women.  I have heard tell that when the knight  goeth to the war, and hath overcome his foes by the shearing of swords  and guileful tricks, and hath come back home to his own folk, they praise  him and bless him, and crown him with flowers, and boast of him before  God in the minster for his deliverance of friend and folk and city.  Why  shouldst thou be worse to me than this?  Now is all said, my dear and my  friend; farewell, farewell!\"    Therewith she turned and went her ways toward the house in all speed, but  making somewhat of a compass.  And when she was gone, Walter knelt down  and kissed the place where her feet had been, and arose thereafter, and  made his way toward the house, he also, but slowly, and staying oft on  his way.          CHAPTER XVII: OF THE HOUSE AND THE PLEASANCE IN THE WOOD      On the morrow morning Walter loitered a while about the house till the  morn was grown old, and then about noon he took his bow and arrows and  went into the woods to the northward, to get him some venison.  He went  somewhat far ere he shot him a fawn, and then he sat him down to rest  under the shade of a great chestnut-tree, for it was not far past the  hottest of the day.  He looked around thence and saw below him a little  dale with a pleasant stream running through it, and he bethought him of  bathing therein, so he went down and had his pleasure of the water and  the willowy banks; for he lay naked a while on the grass by the lip of  the water, for joy of the flickering shade, and the little breeze that  ran over the down-long ripples of the stream.    Then he did on his raiment, and began to come his ways up the bent, but  had scarce gone three steps ere he saw a woman coming towards him from  downstream.  His heart came into his mouth when he saw her, for she  stooped and reached down her arm, as if she would lay her hand on her  ankle, so that at first he deemed it had been the Maid, but at the second  eye-shot he saw that it was the Mistress.  She stood still and looked on  him, so that he deemed she would have him come to her.  So he went to  meet her, and grew somewhat shamefaced as he drew nigher, and wondered at  her, for now was she clad but in one garment of some dark grey silky  stuff, embroidered with, as it were, a garland of flowers about the  middle, but which was so thin that, as the wind drifted it from side and  limb, it hid her no more, but for the said garland, than if water were  running over her: her face was full of smiling joy and content as she  spake to him in a kind, caressing voice, and said: \"I give thee good day,  good Squire, and well art thou met.\"  And she held out her hand to him.  He knelt down before her and kissed it, and abode still upon his knees,  and hanging down his head.    But she laughed outright, and stooped down to him, and put her hand to  his arms, and raised him up, and said to him: \"What is this, my Squire,  that thou kneelest to me as to an idol?\"    He said faltering: \"I wot not; but perchance thou art an idol; and I fear  thee.\"    \"What!\" she said, \"more than yesterday, whenas thou sawest me afraid?\"    Said he: \"Yea, for that now I see thee unhidden, and meseemeth there hath  been none such since the old days of the Gentiles.\"    She said: \"Hast thou not yet bethought thee of a gift to crave of me, a  reward for the slaying of mine enemy, and the saving of me from death?\"    \"O my Lady,\" he said, \"even so much would I have done for any other lady,  or, forsooth, for any poor man; for so my manhood would have bidden me.  Speak not of gifts to me then.  Moreover\" (and he reddened therewith, and  his voice faltered), \"didst thou not give me my sweet reward yesterday?  What more durst I ask?\"    She held her peace awhile, and looked on him keenly; and he reddened  under her gaze.  Then wrath came into her face, and she reddened and knit  her brows, and "]]]
