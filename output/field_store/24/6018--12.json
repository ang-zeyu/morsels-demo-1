For household use there are cases of bottles in quarter-pint       sizes and larger. Armour's Grape Juice is a splendid flavor       for desserts and ices.      Government Inspection    Housewives realize, more than ever before, their responsibility in  selecting for their families foods that are wholesome and healthful. One  of the strictest Government inspections is on butterine. In using  Glendale Butterine there is a saving of fully one third over the cost of  butter, and there is no question about its cleanliness, purity and  wholesomeness.         Armour's Glendale Butterine is carefully wrapped and sold in       paraffined cartons.      The Family Cupboard    Anyone in the family can serve on short notice a meal that is sure to  please,--_if_ the cupboard is well stocked from the extensive variety of  Veribest Soups, Meats and Food Specialties. All are as thoroughly cooked  and seasoned as in the home kitchen, and it's a simple matter to heat  the contents of the cans and serve.         Best grocers in all parts of the country sell Veribest       goods.      A Simple Lesson in Soup Making    The usual process of simmering meats and vegetables is so tedious and  troublesome that frequently soup is omitted from the bill of fare when  there is good reason for its presence. It is especially beneficial in  preparing the way for the easy digestion of heavier foods. Veribest  Soups are scientifically cooked and seasoned. For use, heat the soup and  dilute it to the preferred consistency.      The Choice of the Many    It is the greatest satisfaction to know of one breakfast dish that is  always welcomed by guests. Whether they come from North or South, they  relish sweet, crisp bacon. Armour's Star Bacon is a mild sugar cure,  hickory smoked, and is most delicate.         Star Bacon is sold in glass jars and paper cartons.      Keeping Household Accounts    Buying ham by the single slice is necessarily much more expensive than  buying a whole ham, for there is the cost of cutting besides the waste  by this method. After slices are cut from the whole ham, considerable  meat will be left on the bone. These bits can be used in many ways, and  the bone can be boiled with vegetables or for soup.         Armour's Star Ham is cured and smoked by special process       which has given it the famous flavor.      Little But Efficient    No product is better known or more highly appreciated than the little  jars of Armour's Extract of Beef. This Extract has many uses, and a  little goes far in making soup stock, beef tea, flavoring the cheaper  cuts of meat, gravies and vegetables.         Most druggists and grocers can supply Armour's Extract of       Beef in two sizes of jars.      Women Who Succeed    To have light, flakey pastry, doughnuts that are neither heavy nor  grease-soaked, and fried dishes that are just right, our successful  cooks have found that the first essential is good, old-fashioned pure  leaf lard, tried out in open kettles, just as our grandmothers made it.  Such is Armour's Simon Pure Leaf Lard, which is sold only in pails. Best  dealers can supply it.      A Luncheon Innovation    A piquant meat filling for sandwiches--one that is already prepared and  requires only careful slicing--is Armour's Summer Sausage. Each of the  several kinds is a careful blending of meats and seasoning. Packed in  casing, they will keep indefinitely and therefore it is possible to have  a supply at hand ready for any emergency.          The Secret of Good Cooking Is in the Flavoring      Armour's Extract of Beef is the pure rich flavor of lean beef, in highly  concentrated form. Its use solves many kitchen problems and makes for  economy. Being four times stronger than ordinary extract, only  one-fourth as much can be used, or your food will be too rich.         This Extract of Beef supplies delicious flavor to the       cheaper cuts of meat, enriches vegetable dishes, restores       original tastiness to left-overs, and flavors soups and       gravies.    _Always keep a jar at hand.

I have  frequently had cormorants and shags perched around me within a few  feet; but their suspicions seemed generally to be aroused by human  smell, unless I had rubbed iodine on some part of my clothes.\"    The landrail or corncrake, whose peculiar rasping cry we hear in the  grass or young corn in the spring of the year, is easily called to the  gun by rubbing one notched bone over another, or, better still, using  that peculiar instrument of torture worked at fairs, and called a  \"scratchback\"--the same which, in the palmy days of Greenwich or  Charlton fairs, was retailed to the cry of \"All the fun of the fair  for one penny\".    In bringing this chapter to a close, let me not omit to mention that  all shot birds should immediately have the mouth, palatal slit, and  nostrils, stopped with tow or cotton wool, to prevent the blood from  running out and soiling the feathers; then, if possible, always wrap  each specimen separately in paper, smoothing the feathers in their  proper places before doing so. Also, never carry a shot bird by its  neck, as the weight of the bird's body depending from the neck must  stretch the latter beyond its fair proportions.    I have here briefly glanced at a few of the many ways of taking birds  and beasts; to have described them all would have required a special  volume double the size of the present one. I think, however, I have  said enough for all practical needs; but in case any reader should  require fuller information, I must refer him to such articles as he  will find week by week in The Field, Land and Water, or the American  publication, Forest and Stream.    Good text books, also, on Trapping, etc, are W. B. Lord's \"Shifts and  Expedients of Camp Life,\" Captain Darwin's (\"High Elms\") \"Game  Preservers' Manual,\" Jefferries' \"Amateur Poacher,\" \"Gamekeeper at  Home,\" etc. For details as to the hunting and scientific shooting of  foreign large game, with directions as to the vulnerable spots to be  aimed at, I must again refer the reader to articles from the pen of  such men as Sir Samuel Baker, G. P. Sanderson, \"Smoothbore,\" \"The Old  Shekarry,\" Gordon Cumming, Jules Gerard, C. J. Andersson, Emil Holub,  F. C. Selous, etc, all of whom have either written books on sporting,  or whose articles are still to be met with in late numbers of The  Field.    CHAPTER III.    NECESSARY TOOLS.    A BAD workman, it is said, always quarrels with his tools. If this be  so, it is equally certain that a good workman, though he may make  shift with indifferent implements of his craft, yet always prefers the  best and most labour-saving tools he can procure. The chief point of  difference, however, between the skilled and unskilled workman is,  that the former may and often does get the best results with the  fewest possible tools, while the other must surround himself with  dozens of unnecessary things before he can \"do a stroke.\" This being  so, I propose to point out to my readers in a few words, and by means  of drawings, how very few tools are required to skin and set up a bird  or small animal. My remarks will, therefore, be addressed as much to  the amateur as to the tyro desirous of becoming a professional; in  fact, I wish it to be understood that I write as much to educate the  one as the other.    The first and almost indispensable tool is the knife (I say almost,  because I have known a person begin and finish a small bird with a  pair of scissors); nearly any small knife will do to make the first  incision, but experience has shown the most useful shape to be as in  Fig. 11, which is the skinning knife; the blade, it will be observed,  is long and narrow, 3 in. to 4 in. along the cutting edge, and half an  inch across; the handle, which should be of box, lignum vitae, or any  hard wood susceptible, of a high polish, is 3.5 in. in length,  exclusive of a half-inch brass ferrule; the shape shown is the most  comfortable and handiest to work with. Fig. 12 shows a broader and  stronger knife, five-eighths of an inch across, having a somewhat  differently shaped hard wood handle, as the knife is intended for  heavier work. Fig. 13 shows a broad strong blade, one inch across, and  of an entirely different character; this, which is useful for the  rough, large work, to be hereafter mentioned, has a perforated tang,  to which two half rounded pieces of hard wood should be bolted. Length  of blade and handle, 4 in. each.    My reason for having all of these handles of polished hard wood is,  that blood and dirt will the more easily wash off. All of these knives  are best procured at the leather sellers', for the reasons that,  first, the shapes drawn are always in stock; secondly, they are  manufactured of the finest and toughest steel; and thirdly, their  expense is trifling. The handles, however, are usually of softwood,  unpolished, and had better be replaced at the turner's. The knives  when first purchased are about 4 in. long in the blade; for skinning I  think them pleasantest to use when ground or worn down to 3 in. or 3.5  in.; this, however, is a matter of individual taste.    I have, since the above was written, found that some dealers in  leather and shoemakers' \"grindery\" sell knives of varied and  serviceable patterns--other than those described--all of which have  hard wood handles. Dissecting knives and scalpels, to be procured at  any Surgical instrument maker's, are also very useful for fine work.  \"Transfixion\" knives are of service when engaged upon very large  animals, and here also come in the post-mortem hooks.    Fig. 11, 12, 13--SKINNING KNIVES.    The next most important tool is the scissors, two pairs of which  should be procured, one pair long and fine, 5.5 in. or 6 in. long (see  Fig. 14), for use in small and delicate work connected with birds; the  other about 4 in. long, of a different shape and much stouter and  stronger (see Fig. 15). These are used for general work upon larger  birds or small mammals.    Fig. 14--SCISSORS, No 1. pattern.    Fig. 15--SCISSORS, No 2. pattern.    For still heavier work connected with mammals, and especially with  fish, I prefer a pair of small spring shears, 6 in, to 7 in. long,  similar to those used by gardeners for grape-pruning.    Fig. 16.--Bell-hangers' Pliers.    Fig. 16 brings us to a really indispensable adjunct to the  taxidermist's kit--the compound or bell-hangers' pliers; these pliers  are as the ordinary holding ones at the top, but have a cutting plane  fixed lower down (those with flat, not raised, cutters, are to be  preferred); the figure gives a good idea, but the grip should not be  quite so broad as they are usually made; from 8 in. to 10 in. is the  most useful size. The 10 in. is rather large, but is, perhaps, the  best for professional needs. [Footnote: These pliers are sometimes  made with a nick at the intersection of the joint to form a cutting  plane for thick wires.]    Fig. 17 shows the ordinary cutting nippers, 4 in. to 5 in. long,  useful for cutting fine wires or pins, in situations where the use of  the other pliers is impracticable. Remarks as to grip as before.    Fig. 17--Cutting nippers.    Both of these articles should be of the best workmanship and  materials. Buck, of London, and Stubbs, of Warrington, may be  recommended as good makers.    I lately procured a very handy little pair of cutting nippers of  elegant workmanship, used chiefly by watchmakers, and made in Paris.  These are excellent for delicate work or for cutting very fine wire or  entomological pins (see Fig. 18).    Fig. 18--French Cutting Nippers    I now figure a most necessary little pair of pliers for dressing the  feathers of birds. These are also used by watchmakers, are of neat  construction and differ from most pliers in having an obtusely rounded  point (see Fig. 19, A and B). These, which I call \"feather pliers,\"  are in conjunction with a small, thick, round, camel-hair brush (used  by artists for \"washing in\"), indispensable for \"feathering up\" birds,  a process to be described later on.    Fig. 20 is the next, and I fancy I hear some reader exclaim, \"What on  earth has a goffering-iron to do with taxidermy?\" I reply: This shaped  tool is wanted for artfully conveying small morsels of tow, etc, into  the necks and hollow places of birds' skins. It may be easily made in  this wise: Procure as small and fine a pair of goffering-irons as you  possibly can, and have them drawn out and brought to a fine yet obtuse  point by some smith, and you thus get a finished tool for about half  what it would cost to make outright. Length, when finished, should be  somewhere about 10 in.    Fig. 19--Feather Pliers    A large and a fine crooked awl with handles, a file, and a rough stone  from the leatherseller's, are other things to procure, and these, with  the ten tools previously particularised, some tow, wool, wire, eyes,  and a needle and thread, a pot of preservative paste, and a piece of  wood or a wire for a stuffing iron, are all that the amateur or the  professional requires to skin and stuff a small or medium-sized bird  or mammal. Cost of the stone and tools (which, with ordinary care,  will last for years) should be within the reach of all.    Fig. 20--Tow Forceps    The \"stuffing iron\" mentioned above is best made, if wanted for small  birds, from the broken steel of a wool comber's \"devil,\" about nine  inches long, fixed in a bradawl handle of about four inches, or, if  for large birds or mammals, the iron may be made from a broken fencing  foil, to any size between twelve and thirty inches, with suitable  handle. In either case the smallest end is driven into the handle, and  the top is filed across with a smooth nick, to push in, but not to  retain the"]]]
