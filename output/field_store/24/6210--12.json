It seldom occurs as far north as  New England and in a general way east of the Rocky Mountains its  northern limit approximates that of forty-three degrees of latitude.  It varies considerably in size and differs greatly in abundance in  different localities and different seasons.       [Illustration: Caterpillar of the Blue Swallowtail.       (After Riley)]    Probably the commonest food plant of the caterpillars is the  Dutchman's Pipe or Aristolochia, which is frequently planted as an  ornamental vine for porch adornment. It also feeds upon wild ginger or  Asarum and probably upon other plants. A dozen or more eggs are laid  upon a leaf by the mother butterfly, usually in a cluster or grouped  near together. They hatch a week or so later into small brownish  caterpillars which remain together for awhile in little groups that  feed side by side upon the leaf, beginning at the margin and working  toward the centre. As they become larger they feed more freely and  gradually disperse so that each forages for himself. As they approach  maturity their appetites become voracious and their presence is often  shown by the defoliated condition of the branches. They have back of  the head the osmateria or scent organs which are commonly found in  the other caterpillars of this genus, but the odor emitted by them is  likely to be less pronounced than usual.       [Illustration: TWO OF THE SWALLOWTAILS       (Three fourths natural size)         The Palamedes (_see page 76_)       The Giant (_see page 62_)]         [Illustration:                                      _See page 67_         THE GREEN-CLOUDED SWALLOWTAIL         Upper surface above; lower surface below]    When full grown the caterpillars find such shelter as they may and  each spins a bit of silken web and a silken loop which hold it while  it changes to the chrysalis. This chrysalis is very likely to take on  the colors of the immediate surroundings and thus be rather difficult  to see. If the egg was laid by one of the spring or early summer  butterflies, the chrysalis will soon change to a butterfly which will  appear toward midsummer and which may lay eggs for another brood of  caterpillars. These caterpillars mature to chrysalids the same season  and some of them are believed to change into butterflies in autumn,  these butterflies hibernating through the winter; while others are  believed to remain unchanged through the winter and disclose the  butterfly the following spring. This is an exceptional condition for  the Swallowtails and it is worth while to make careful observations  along its northern limits to learn more definitely the facts as to the  winter condition.       =The Green-clouded Swallowtail=    _Papilio troilus_    This beautiful butterfly is essentially a southern species and is  found over a wide range of territory from the Mississippi River to the  Atlantic Ocean. It occurs as far north as New Hampshire and Vermont  and has even been reported from Alberta, Canada. It is easily  recognized by the blue-green clouding of the upper surface of the  wings, the general color being velvety black with distinctive rows of  yellow spots along the margins of the front wing. These spots are  present also on the hind wing where they are almost changed to blue  because overlaid with a general cloudiness of this color. On the under  surface of the hind wings there are two rows of orange-brown spots,  the inner row being nearly crescent-shaped and the outer row oblong.  In the living insect the tail projections on the hind wings are  usually twisted into a vertical plane at right angles to the plane of  the wings.    The caterpillars of this species feed upon the leaves of sassafras and  spice bush. The distribution of the butterfly appears to be closely  related to the distribution of these plants.    As is the case with so many of our Swallowtail butterflies, the  Green-clouded Swallowtail passes through the winter in the chrysalis  stage. Late in spring the butterflies emerge and soon afterward lay  their eggs singly upon the leaves of sassafras or spice bush. The eggs  soon hatch into lead-colored caterpillars, largely covered with spiny  warts. Each caterpillar cleverly makes a protecting nest by eating out  a narrow strip in the leaf which frees a flap along the margin that is  turned back upon the leaf, making a case in which the larva lives. It  spins a silken carpet on one side of the case and rests upon this  carpet when at home. During its feeding periods it goes outside and  eats the tissues of the other parts of the same leaf. It continues to  occupy this first nest for a week or more by which time the rest of  the leaf is likely to be pretty well consumed.    Having passed the first moult and thus become larger and having  practically eaten itself out of its first house and home the  caterpillar now crawls to a larger leaf where it proceeds to make a  more enduring structure. In this case it does not need to bite a  channel along one side of the midrib as it did before, but instead it  begins to spin silken threads transversely across the upper surface in  such a way as to fold over the border of the leaf and make a tubular  chamber in which it has plenty of room to move about. It uses this as  its home for some time thereafter, wandering out at evening to feed  upon neighboring leaves as its hunger necessitates. In this way it  continues to feed and grow for a week or two. Then it finds it  necessary to construct still another home, which it does by bringing  together the opposite sides of a leaf, taking care to have a door-like  opening at the base of the blade next the leaf stalk. This third home  serves it to the end of its larval existence. It goes in and out as  necessary, remaining concealed when it casts its skin and until the  body tissues harden afterward. Apparently it devours the cast skin and  thrusts the hard covering of the head out of the nest. Consequently  these little homes are clean and sanitary and serve admirably their  protecting purpose.    The full-grown caterpillars have the curious appearance of those of  the other Swallowtails. The third ring behind the head is greatly  swollen, making, with the rings directly in front of it, a  characteristic picture suggesting a grotesque face with large eye-like  spots at the top. The general color is green, darker above than below,  and there are six rows of blue dots along the body. (_See plate,  page 80._)    When ready to change to the chrysalis, the caterpillars desert their  leafy homes and on a twig or board or stone each spins a bit of silken  webbing and a silken loop. They now change to chrysalids which are  likely to resemble the color of the background and which are somewhat  smoother than many of the Swallowtail chrysalids. About two weeks  later the butterflies emerge.      _The Eclosion of the Butterfly_    The transformation of a chrysalis into a butterfly is always one of  extraordinary interest. Comparatively few definite descriptions of  this process have been given by careful observers. One of the best of  these is that written by Mr. Scudder in connection with the emergence  of this butterfly, and it is so accurate and complete that it seems  worth while to quote it at length:    \"The butterfly generally emerges from the chrysalis early in the day,\"  writes Mr. Scudder, \"and the first signs of the immediate change are  strong forward and backward movements of the chrysalis at intervals of  a few seconds; perhaps the third or fourth attempt will be successful,  when a click may be heard at the distance of several feet; but all the  subsequent movements are absolutely noiseless, though rapid; at  intervals of three or four seconds, spasmodic movements similar to the  first carry on the process; first the split continues along the  thorax; then it runs down either side between the legs and wings,  ultimately to the tips of the antennae. As this progresses, the  actions become more strenuous and more frequently repeated; with eager  efforts the butterfly pushes forward its half-detached head; now an  antenna springs from its case, at once assuming its natural attitude;  the other soon follows, and then the wings are partially drawn from  their sheaths, and while in this position seem to be used as levers or  arms to aid in withdrawing the rest of the body; next the legs appear,  seize the upper part of the chrysalis skin, and speedily withdraw the  whole body. It is now a curious-looking object, the wings wrinkled  and bloated, and, although the whole process of escape lasts little  more than half a minute, already twice the size of the sheaths they  lately occupied. The insect crawls upward until it finds a secure  resting place, and there remains until ready for flight; each half of  the tongue, drawn independently from its receptacle, is rolled in a  separate spiral, and now while the wings are gradually expanding the  insect applies all its energies to uniting their two parts,  incessantly rolls and unrolls them, and beginning simultaneously at  the base, gradually fits them together by their interlocking joints;  in about fifteen minutes all but the tips are perfectly united; these  require nearly fifteen minutes more, and are not fairly interlocked  until the wings are fully expanded, nearly a full half hour after the  escape from the chrysalis; the wings, however, are still tender, and  generally require two hours to stiffen. When at last the insect  ventures upon flight, it is not with an uncertain flutter, but boldly  and steadily, as if long accustomed to the action.\"    The butterflies of this second brood of the season are likely to begin  to appear early in August, continuing to become more abundant  throughout that month. These lay eggs upon the same food plant and the  caterpillars grow to maturity in the same way as those of the first  brood. They become full grown during September or October, and then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3708"],[0,"An Introduction to Chemical Science (#13)"],[1,"O from the air makes NO2, which liquefies  and gives an acid reaction and a red color.

LAWS OF DEFINITE AND OF MULTIPLE PROPORTION.    113. Weight and Volume.--We have seen that water contains two  parts of H by volume to one part of O; or, by weight, two parts  of H to sixteen of O. These proportions are invariable, or no  symbol for water would be possible. Every compound in the same  way has an unvarying proportion of elements.    114. Law of Definite Proportion.--In a given compound the  proportion of any element by weight, or, if a gas, by volume is  always constant. Apply the law, by weight and by volume, to  these: HCl, NH3, H2S, N2O.    There is another law of equal importance in chemistry, which the  compounds of N and O well illustrate.                                     Weight.     Volume.                                 N.

Also that the proportion by volume of  O is a multiple of that in the first compound. In this example  the N remains the same. If that had varied in the different  compounds, it would also havevaried by a multiple of the smallest  proportion. This is true in all compounds.    115. Law of Multiple Proportion.--Whenever one element combines  with another in more than one proportion, it always combines in  some multiple, one or more, of its least combining weight, or, if  a gas, of its least combining volume.    The least combining weight of an element is its atomic weight;  and it is this fact of a least combining weight that leads us to  believe the atom to be indivisible.    Apply the law in the case of P2O, P2O3, P2O5; in HClO, HClO2,  HClO3, HClO4, arranging the symbols, weights, and volumes in a  table, as above.    The volumetric proportions of each element in the oxides of  nitrogen are exhibited below.      _ + _ + _ = __  N + N + O = N2O    _ + _ + _ + _ = __  N + N + O + O = N2O2    _ + _ + _ + _ + _ = __  N + N + O + O + O = N2O3    _ + _ + _ + _ + _ + _ = __  N + N + O + O + O + O = N2O4    _ + _ + _ + _ + _ + _ + _ = __  N + N + O + O + O + O + O = N2O5    CHAPTER XXIV.    CARBON PROTOXIDE.    116. Preparation.    Experiment 72.--Put into a flask, of 200 cc., 5 g. of oxalic acid  crystals, H2C2O4, and 25 cc. H2SO4. Have the d.t. pass into a  solution of NaOH in a Woulff bottle (Fig. 31), and collect  the gas over water. Heat the flask slowly, and avoid inhaling the  gas.    117. Tests.    Experiment 73.--Remove a receiver of the gas, and try to light  the latter with a splinter. Is it combustible, or a supporter of  (C) combustion? What is the color of the flame? When the  combustion ceases, shake up a little lime water with the gas left  in the receiver. What gas has been formed by the combustion, as  shown by the test? See page 80. Give the reaction for the  combustion.    We have seen that H2SO4 has great affinity for H2O. Oxalic acid  consists of H, C, O in the right proportion to form H2O, CO2, and  CO. H2SO4 withdraws H and O in the right proportion to form  water, unites them, and then absorbs the water, leaving the C and  O to combine and form CO2 and CO. NaOH solution removes CO2 from  the mixture, forming Na2CO3, and leaves CO. Write both reactions.    118. Carbon Protoxide, called also carbon monoxide, carbonic  oxide, etc., is a gas, having no color or taste, butpossessing a  faint odor. It is very poisonous. Being the lesser oxide of C, it  is formed when C is burned in a limited supply of O, whereas CO2  is always produced when O is abundant. The formation of each is  well shown by tracing the combustion in a coal fire. Air enters  at the bottom, and CO2 is first formed. C + 2O = CO2. As this gas  passes up, the white-hot coal removes one atom of O, leaving CO.  CO2 + C - 2CO. At the top, if the draft be open, a blue flame  shows the combustion of CO. CO + O = CO2. The same reduction of  CO2 takes place in the iron furnace, and whenever there is not  enough oxygen to form CO2, the product is CO.    Great care should be taken that this gas does not escape into the  room, as one per cent has proved fatal. Not all of it is burned  at the top of the coal; and when the stove door is open, the  upper drafts should be open also. It is the most poisonous of the  gases from coal; hence the danger from sleeping in a room having  a coal fire.    119. Water Gas.--CO is one of the constituents of \"water gas,\"  which, by reason of its cheapness, is supplanting gas made from  coal, as an illuminator, in some cities. It is made by passing  superheated steam over red-hot charcoal or coke. C unites with  the O of H2O, forming CO, and sets H free, thus producing two  inflammable gases. C + H2O --? As neither of these gives much  light, naphtha is distilled and mixed with them in small  quantities to furnish illuminating power See page 183.    CHAPTER XXV.    CARBON DIOXIDE.    120. Preparation.    Experiment 74.--Put into a t.t., or a bottle with a d.t. and a  thistle-tube, 10 or 20 g. CaCO3, marble in lumps; add as many  cubic centimeters of H2O, and half as much HCl, and collect the  gas by downward displacement (Fig. 39). Add more acid as needed.  CaCO3 + 2 HCl = CaCl2 + H2CO3. H2CO3 = H2O + CO2. H2CO3 is a very  weak compound, and at once breaks up. By some, its existence as a  compound is doubted.    121. Tests.    Experiment 75.--(1) Put a burning and a glowing stick into the  t.t. or bottle. (2) Hold the end of the d.t. directly against the  flame of a small burning stick. Does the gas support combustion?  (3) Pour a receiver of the gas over a candle flame. What does  this show of the weight of the gas? (4) Pass a little CO2 into  some H2O (Fig. 32), and test it with litmus. Give the reaction  for the solution of CO2 in H2O.    Experiment 76.--Put into a t.t. 51 cc. of clear Ca(OH)2 solution,  i.e. lime water; insert in this the end of a d.t. from a CO2  generator (Fig. 32). Notice any ppt. formed. It is CaCO3. Let the  action continue until the ppt. disappears and the liquid is  clear. Then remove the d.t., boil the clear liquid for a minute,  and notice whether the ppt. reappears.    122. Explanation.    Ca(OH)2 + CO2 = CaCO3 + H2O. The curious phenomena of this  experiment are explained by the solubility of CaCO3 in water  containing CO2, and its insolu-bility in water, having no CO2.  When all the Ca(OH)3 is combined, or changed to CaCO3, the excess  of CO2 unites with H2O, forming the weak acid H2CO3, which  dissolves the precipitate, CaCO3, and gives a clear liquid. On  heating this, H2CO3 gives up its CO2, and CaCO3 is  reprecipitated, not being soluble in pure water.    Lime water, Ca(OH)2 solution, is therefore a test for the  presence of CO2. To show that carbon dioxide is formed in  breathing, and in the combustion of C, and that it is present in  the air, perform the following experiment:    Experiment 77.--(1) Put a little lime water into a t.t., and blow  into it through a piece of glass tubing. Any turbidity shows  what? (2) Burn a candle for a few minutes in a receiver of air,  then take out the candle and shake up lime water with the gas.  (3) Expose some lime water in an e.d. to the air for some time.    133. Oxidation in the Human System.--Carbon dioxide, or carbonic  anhydride, carbonic acid, etc., CO2, is a heavy gas, without  color or odor. It has a sharp, prickly taste, and is commonly  reckoned as poisonous if inhaled in large quantities, though it  does not chemically combine with the blood as CO does.
