He was of course nervous and shy, and no doubt would  always be so. Perhaps it was these characteristics that gave him the  further one of extraordinary gentleness, that won all hearts. Many had  already said, with a laugh, that he was \"born good\"; but latterly some  had come to add that he was incapable of harm or ill.    And yet with these characteristics, amounting as they did to a certain  softness, there was never any question of his pluck and spirit. Nor was  there any limit to it. He had the spirit and \"go\" of any dozen of his  countrymen: what more could possibly be said? At the same time he had the  gentleness of a child. He recalled to mind one of those characters that  some of us have met, and in strange situations--situations and hours when  men's spirits were on fire, and when the air was filled with sounds that  once to hear is never to forget. One such is recalled by memory now--a  vision of a lithe and active figure that had come its longest marches,  and borne the many hardships of the many nights and days, though looking  frail as a girl in her teens, and with manner always gentle as a child.  For one like that to be amidst such doings as these seemed incongruous.  Yet had the estimate proved in the end quite false. Breeding and  pluck--nervous energy--had carried through, when others had gone down.  And the pluck and the breeding showed itself still, when the blood  dripped, and ebbed away, and the face was white as a stone.    Nor is such a parallel as far fetched as might at first appear. Given the  two, the dog and the man, this dog was to show before the end  characteristics equally striking and of scarcely less charm. To bear pain  is not easy. There is no longer doubt that men feel pain in varying  degrees, and that sufferings that might be considered identical are  multiplied tenfold in the case of a highly developed organisation. With  the high intelligence and nervous development of this dog, it might have  been thought that pain would terrify. If so, he never showed it.    It is unnecessary here to refer to the many instances when his dash and  high spirit brought about an accident, for all our dogs get into trouble  and meet with accidents at times--at least, those of any worth. But it  was this dog's further habit to avoid, when in pain, the company of the  one he loved best, and to go invariably to a woman for aid. It was as  much as to say that he knew that many men were in such cases worse than  useless: a thrust in this instance not without its truth. Thus he came  home two miles one night in snow, with both fore-feet cut right across  with glass--due to a dash at a rat in some rushes on the frozen  riverbank. To his master's eternal shame he never found it out. But, on  arriving home, this dog went straight off for attention, of his own  accord, and bore what he had to bear, not only without a flinch, but  showing his gratitude by licking the hand that was tending him. So again,  when he was once badly stubbed, he went to the same quarter, showed his  foot, and then lay down, staying perfectly quiet while a spike was looked  for, at last found, and then pulled out with a pair of iron pincers.    These are trivialities, no doubt; but they would not be trivialities to  some of Us. It is by such that character shows itself--is moulded and  made up--for others to estimate and take due note of. And thus it is that  whether they are exhibited by man or animal, we admit their charm and pay  our tribute to them, just as Theron's faithfulness to Roderick drew these  words from the lips of the aged Severian:               \"Hast thou some charm, which draws about thee thus             The hearts of all our house--even to the beast             That lacks discourse of reason, but too oft,             With uncorrupted feeling and dumb faith,             Puts lordly man to shame?\"                                              X      The hay harvest had been a light one, owing to the weather in the spring  and the absence of wet. It was hardly off the ground before the corn  harvest had begun and the long arms of the self-binder were to be seen  waving in the air above the standing oats, the first of all, this season,  to go down. \"The moon had come in on dry earth,\" as the harvesters  expressed it; and with implicit faith in the moon, there would therefore  be no rain. For once in a way faith was not misplaced: there was great  heat, which ripened wheat and oats and barley too quickly, left the straw  short, and covered the turnips with fly.    It was too hot in the day to go far--that is, for those in life who can  choose their own time. So the dog and the man took their walks late, and  prolonged them to the hour when the ruddy moon rose solemnly into the sky  over the woods and set out on its low, summer curve to the west. Daylight  lasted long after the sun went down: a hot glow spread gradually  northward, and what with the light in this direction and the moon at  full, only those two other worlds, Jupiter and Venus, were visible in the  cloudless vault above. This was the time of day to be abroad, but, oddly  enough, the hour when many were indoors. There was some excuse for the  harvesters. They had been up with the sun: by half-past seven it was time  to put the self-binder to bed in the field; by eight, or soon after, many  were in bed themselves. Men and horses had sweated much, and had had a  long day.    It was on an evening such as this that Murphy had his first lesson in  working to the hand, for Job's remark had given rise to a train of  thought. Education was of course everything. Those who lived on the land  should be educated in the things of the land; should learn, if not its  deeper wonders and mysteries, at least its simple lessons and what lay at  the back of these. It was in these fields and over these breezy downs  that thews and sinews were to be braced, health and strength gathered,  souls cleansed, if so be that the ways of the man were straight and true.    Here was God's work always visible, from the wonders of the growth of the  seeds to the coming of the music of the rains that washed the air and  made the land sing with life. Here was always visible the infinite power  of small things, beauty unstained, Nature's laws always in full  operation--the triumph of good work, the smothering of that which was  ill. Here in these very fields had been gathered the strength of arm that  had stood the country in good stead, when the drums beat and true men  were wanted beyond seas. That seemed to be more as it should be. And so  it may be yet--that is, when the craze of a day has passed, and the men  of the land come back.    Education would do it. Some hearts would be bitten with the old love, and  learn to forget the new. But the education must be true and not false, in  tune with the life that shall be; not cramped and with little connection  between it and the field of labour that lies ahead. Uniformity is often  but to bring down to one dead level, to crush true liberty and freedom,  to force unnatural growth, and to give this a trend untrue. Education on  such lines seems curiously false to many minds, as well as stultifying.    Scot, who had no appearance of a sheep-dog--that is, as his class are  generally portrayed in coloured prints--might possibly have been brought  up as a water-spaniel, or he might have been the darling of a  semi-detached villa and have learnt to walk drab, unlovely streets  without endangering his life: it is all a matter of education, fortified  by environment. As it was, he was brought up with a cottage for a home  and learnt the mysteries of sheep, the tending and the care of them, what  the stretching of limbs meant, no less than freedom and free air.    The life was a hard one, no doubt, in one sense. Sometimes there were  short commons: there was much bad weather to be faced, when his master  was clad in strange clothes and wore a sack like the hood of a monk over  the top of his weather-worn cap, and he himself was glad to get to the  shelter of the hut, where the stove was burning: there was the wet, when  all alike were mud-smothered: there were the biting winds of March. But  there came the glad spring and the long summer days; the one gave a  flavour to the other and created a love for both, and deep down in the  heart where that love burnt bright was the pride of his calling, the  honour of tending sheep. Soft jobs were not for men--or manly dogs.    Of course Murphy could not be a sheep-dog; that is, unless Job Nutt had a  mind to make him. Then, of course, he would have had a proper  schoolmaster, and been brought up to things among which he had been born  and bred, while lookers-on beheld a novel kind of sheep-dog. As it was,  however, his master owned no sheep. Yet, seeing that his lot had not been  that of some--to walk the streets for exercise, or to lie in the cramped  garden of a villa in a town--it was only right he should learn all that  he could, and that his education should partake of the fields and the  upland downs around his home.    As to whether it would have been possible to have trained him to the  streets at all must now be left among the things unknown. The impression  remains that, seeing he never grasped the desperate dangers of the modern  road, his life, had he been so foolish as to forsake the country for the  town, would probably have been limited to hours. For a better, freer life  he was fortunately born, and he certainly never threw this chance away,  but made the very most of it, and came to great happiness thereby.    Of course it took time; but a beginning was made in those halcyon, summer  days, and the art of working by the hand gradually brought to some  perfection. No little of this dog's gladness in life was centred  eventually in this accomplishment, and he was never"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25823"],[0,"The Story of Leather (#13)"],[1,"the obligation is one that will go down from father to son  so long as a Coddington lives to bear the name. Good-night, my boy.\"          [Illustration]    CHAPTER VII    THE CLIMB UP THE LADDER      If Peter expected to hear more of the mysterious tie that linked his  family with that of the Jacksons he was disappointed; for his father did  not refer to the story again, and although the boy burned with curiosity  to know more he had not the courage to ask. Had not Mr. Coddington gone  steadily forward perfecting plans for the seashore outing it would have  seemed as if the incident had entirely slipped from his mind. But the  personal interest he displayed in arranging every detail of the trip  proved beyond question that the memory of the obligation at which he had  hinted was still vividly before him. The vacation was arranged without  trouble. Mrs. Jackson's first objections to accepting this favor at the  hands of the Coddington Company were quieted when told by the doctors  that the plan would be highly beneficial to the health of her boy. Both  Peter and Nat were in high spirits. To lads who had been confined within  doors all summer the prospect of bathing, sailing, and a month in the  open was like water to the thirsty.    Fortunately Dame Nature herself smiled graciously upon the project, for  during the next four weeks she coaxed back to earth warm, golden days  from the fast fleeing Indian summer. The magic touch of sunshine and  fresh air flooded Nat's cheek with healthy color and as if by miracle,  strength returned to the delicate ankle; as for Peter he became swarthy  as a young Arab. So delighted was Mrs. Jackson in watching the  transformation in her two boys that she was quite unaware that a soft  pinkiness was stealing into her own face. A vacation had seemed such an  impossible thing that she had never dared picture how welcome such a  rest would be.    When, weeks later, the trio returned to town and Mr. Coddington  surprised them by meeting them at the station with the motor-car his  gratification was extreme. He waved aside all thanks, however, and after  dropping Nat and his mother at their home he rolled off with Peter,  explaining that he would take the lad to his own door. Nat wondered not  a little where that door was, and he would have been overwhelmed with  amazement had he known that portals no less pretentious than those of  the Coddington mansion itself opened to receive his chum. Very wide open  indeed were they thrown when the car bringing Peter and his father  turned into the long avenue leading to the house. How glad Peter's  mother was to see him, and how satisfied she was with the witchcraft  that wind and wave had wrought!    \"I guess there is no doubt that now you are fit either for school or for  work, Peter,\" said Mr. Coddington. \"Which is it to be? Are you still  firm in your decision to stick to the tannery? It isn't too late to  change your mind, you know, if you wish to do so.\"    \"I'm firmer for the tannery than ever, Father,\" answered Peter, smiling.    \"Going to fight it out, are you?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Good!\"    It was only one word, but Peter knew that his father was pleased.    Accordingly on the following Monday morning the boy again took up his  old work in the finishing department. Here Nat joined him, and since  this branch of leather manufacture was an entirely new world to Jackson,  Peter took his turn at explaining its various processes, and felt no  little pride in having the teaching obligations reversed, and being able  to give his chum instructions concerning matters of which he was  ignorant. The two boys were becoming quite expert at boarding calfskins  and had settled down with great contentment to this task when one day  they were surprised and perhaps not a little disappointed to receive  orders to leave their present occupation and report for duty at Factory  2, the sheepskin tannery.    [Illustration: IN THE FINISHING DEPARTMENT]    \"Another beamhouse!\" exclaimed Peter in dismay. \"I thought we were  through with that sort of thing for good and all, Nat.\"    \"Oh, it isn't likely we'll stay there,\" was Nat's hopeful rejoinder.  \"Evidently somebody higher up wants us to have this chance to see how  sheepskins are prepared and I, for one, am not sorry for I've no very  clear idea.\"    \"I'm worse off than you, Nat,\" chuckled Peter. \"I've no idea at all.\"    \"Nonsense, Peter! By this time you must know the general process for  preparing skins.\"    \"Why, yes. I suppose the hair is taken off and the skins tanned just as  calfskins are.\"    \"Yes, the main facts are the same. There are many points, however, where  the processes differ because the skins of sheep, kids, goats, and such  creatures must undergo entirely different treatment. The kid used for  gloves and even for shoes, you see, is far more delicate than is the  calfskin that we have been finishing.\"    \"Yes, of course,\" agreed Peter thoughtfully. \"Well, I suppose we shall  now find out all about it and that it will be interesting; but I do  wish, Nat, that we could learn it somewhere except in another  beamhouse.\"    Peter's wish, alas, was of no avail and accordingly once more the two  boys donned rubber boots and overalls and started again at the foot of  the ladder--this time in Factory 2, where the skins of sheep, kids, and  goats were tanned. Sheepskins, they soon learned, were received by the  tanners in one of two conditions: either the wool was already off and  they arrived in casks drenched or pickled, many bales of one dozen each  being packed in a cask; or the skins came to the tannery salted, with  the wool on and precisely in the condition that they were when taken  from the backs of the sheep at the ranches and abattoirs. So long as the  hair was on the skins were called \"pelts\"; but the moment the hair was  removed the skins became \"slats.\" The pickled skins it was simple enough  to tan, for they had been carefully prepared for the tanners before  being shipped; there were firms, the foreman told Peter, that did just  this very thing. If desired the pickled sheepskins could even be worked  into a cheap white leather without further tanning. Most of them,  however, were tanned.    But the unhairing of the sheep pelts was a different problem. After they  had been soaked about twenty-four hours in borax and water to get out  the dirt and salt they must first be put through a machine that cleansed  the wool and shaved off any fat adhering to the flesh side. Then they  were ready to have the wool removed. A very delicate process this was,  Peter and Nat soon discovered. Each pelt was spread smoothly on a table  wool side down, and a preparation of lime and sulphide of sodium was  spread evenly over it with a brush, great care being taken to let none  of the liquid used get upon the wool side of the skin. The pelt was then  folded and left from eight to ten hours until the solution which had  been brushed over it had penetrated it and loosened the hair. The wool  could then very easily be pulled off, sorted as the skins were unhaired,  and sold to dealers as \"pulled wool.\"    One fact interested Peter very much, and that was that usually the slats  were thinnest where the wool was longest.    \"I suppose the strength of the sheep all went to its hair,\" speculated  he to Nat. \"Isn't it funny that it should!\"    Another thing the boys learned about sheepskins which was very different  from the treatment of calfskins was that before the slats could be  tanned they had to be put through a powerful press and have the grease  squeezed out of them.    \"The skin of a sheep has a vast amount of oil in it,\" explained one of  the workmen, \"and it is impossible to do anything until this grease has  been extracted; so we put a bunch of skins under a heavy press and then  collect the grease that runs out, refine, and sell it.\"    Peter and Nat watched this pressing with great interest.    When the skins came out of the press they were so hard and stiff that it  was necessary to put them into the revolving drums that separated and  softened them. This was called \"wheeling up the slats.\" The odor  in the press room was far worse than anything that Peter had yet  encountered--much more disagreeable than was an ordinary beamhouse.  Both he and Nat were only too glad when noon time came and they could  get out into the air.    \"Whew!\" cried Peter, throwing himself down in the sunshine, \"I hope they  don't put us in that press room to work, Nat.\"    \"It's fierce, isn't it?\" Nat answered. \"The men must hate it.\"    \"I suppose they get accustomed to it just as I got used to the  beamhouse,\" Peter said. \"Why, when I began work in the beamhouse of  Factory 1 I thought I never could endure it. Do you remember how you  tried to cheer me up that first day?\"    Nat laughed at the memory.    \"Indeed I do. You looked perfectly hopeless, Peter.\"    \"That's about the way I felt,\" smiled Peter, \"and I believe I'd feel so  again if I thought I had weeks of that press room smell before me.\"    But Peter need not have feared any such calamity, for after lunch he and  Nat were given a lesson in tanning sheepskins and were told they were  to work at that task until further notice.    The process, they discovered, differed very radically from the calfskin  treatment with which they were so familiar. Many of the slats were  tanned by being laid in trays of fine, moist powder that looked like  brown sugar.    \"What is this stuff?\" inquired Peter of a man who stood near by.    \"That is sumac, young man.\"    \"Sumac! Just common sumac?\"    \"Well, no. It is the same sort of thing, though. We import this from  Sicily, because the foreign leaves grow larger and contain more tannin.  Sicilian sumac makes better leather than does the American variety,  which comes chiefly from Virginia.\"    Peter nodded.    \"And how long, pray, do the skins lie covered up in this snuffy brown  powder?\" questioned Nat.    \"About a week,\""]]]
