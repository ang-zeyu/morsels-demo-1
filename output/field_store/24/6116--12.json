Sec. XL. \"And is this,\" it will be asked of me, \"the time, is this  the worship, to which you would have us look back with reverence and  regret?\" Inasmuch as redemption is ascribed to the Virgin, No. Inasmuch  as redemption is a thing desired, believed, rejoiced in, Yes,--and Yes a  thousand times. As far as the Virgin is worshipped in place of God, No;  but as far as there is the evidence of worship itself, and of the sense  of a Divine presence, Yes. For there is a wider division of men than  that into Christian and Pagan: before we ask what a man worships, we  have to ask whether he worships at all. Observe Christ's own words on  this head: \"God is a spirit; and they that worship Him must worship Him  in spirit, _and_ in truth.\" The worshipping in spirit comes first, and  it does not necessarily imply the worshipping in truth. Therefore, there  is first the broad division of men into Spirit worshippers and Flesh  worshippers; and then, of the Spirit worshippers, the farther division  into Christian and Pagan,--worshippers in Falsehood or in Truth. I  therefore, for the moment, omit all inquiry how far the Mariolatry of  the early church did indeed eclipse Christ, or what measure of deeper  reverence for the Son of God was still felt through all the grosser  forms of Madonna worship. Let that worship be taken at its worst; let  the goddess of this dome of Murano be looked upon as just in the same  sense an idol as the Athene of the Acropolis, or the Syrian Queen of  Heaven; and then, on this darkest assumption, balance well the  difference between those who worship and those who worship not;--that  difference which there is in the sight of God, in all ages, between the  calculating, smiling, self-sustained, self-governed man, and the  believing, weeping, wondering, struggling, Heaven-governed man;--between  the men who say in their hearts \"there is no God,\" and those who  acknowledge a God at every step, \"if haply they might feel after Him and  find Him.\" For that is indeed the difference which we shall find, in the  end, between the builders of this day and the builders on that sand  island long ago. They _did_ honor something out of themselves; they did  believe in spiritual presence judging, animating, redeeming them; they  built to its honor and for its habitation; and were content to pass away  in nameless multitudes, so only that the labor of their hands might fix  in the sea-wilderness a throne for their guardian angel. In this was  their strength, and there was indeed a Spirit walking with them on the  waters, though they could not discern the form thereof, though the  Masters voice came not to them, \"It is I.\" What their error cost them,  we shall see hereafter; for it remained when the majesty and the  sincerity of their worship had departed, and remains to this day.  Mariolatry is no special characteristic of the twelfth century; on the  outside of that very tribune of San Donato, in its central recess, is an  image of the Virgin which receives the reverence once paid to the blue  vision upon the inner dome. With rouged cheeks and painted brows, the  frightful doll stands in wretchedness of rags, blackened with the smoke  of the votive lamps at its feet; and if we would know what has been lost  or gained by Italy in the six hundred years that have worn the marbles  of Murano, let us consider how far the priests who set up this to  worship, the populace who have this to adore, may be nobler than the men  who conceived that lonely figure standing on the golden field, or than  those to whom it seemed to receive their prayer at evening, far away,  where they only saw the blue clouds rising out of the burning sea.

I. \"And so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus.\" If as the  shores of Asia lessened upon his sight, the spirit of prophecy had  entered into the heart of the weak disciple who had turned back when his  hand was on the plough, and who had been judged, by the chiefest of  Christ's captains, unworthy thenceforward to go forth with him to the  work,[19] how wonderful would he have thought it, that by the lion  symbol in future ages he was to be represented among men! how woful,  that the war-cry of his name should so often reanimate the rage of the  soldier, on those very plains where he himself had failed in the courage  of the Christian, and so often dye with fruitless blood that very  Cypriot Sea, over whose waves, in repentance and shame, he was following  the Son of Consolation!    Sec. II. That the Venetians possessed themselves of his body in the ninth  century, there appears no sufficient reason to doubt, nor that it was  principally in consequence of their having done so, that they chose him  for their patron saint. There exists, however, a tradition that before  he went into Egypt he had founded the Church at Aquileia, and was thus,  in some sort, the first bishop of the Venetian isles and people. I  believe that this tradition stands on nearly as good grounds as that of  St. Peter having been the first bishop of Rome;[20] but, as usual, it is  enriched by various later additions and embellishments, much resembling  the stories told respecting the church of Murano. Thus we find it  recorded by the Santo Padre who compiled the \"Vite de' Santi spettanti  alle Chiese di Venezia,\"[21] that \"St. Mark having seen the people of  Aquileia well grounded in religion, and being called to Rome by St.  Peter, before setting off took with him the holy bishop Hermagoras, and  went in a small boat to the marshes of Venice. There were at that period  some houses built upon a certain high bank called Rialto, and the boat  being driven by the wind was anchored in a marshy place, when St. Mark,  snatched into ecstasy, heard the voice of an angel saying to him: 'Peace  be to thee, Mark; here shall thy body rest.'\" The angel goes on to  foretell the building of \"una stupenda, ne piu veduta Citta;\" but the  fable is hardly ingenious enough to deserve farther relation.    Sec. III. But whether St. Mark was first bishop of Aquileia or not, St.  Theodore was the first patron of the city; nor can he yet be considered  as having entirely abdicated his early right, as his statue, standing on  a crocodile, still companions the winged lion on the opposing pillar of  the piazzetta. A church erected to this Saint is said to have occupied,  before the ninth century, the site of St. Mark's; and the traveller,  dazzled by the brilliancy of the great square, ought not to leave it  without endeavoring to imagine its aspect in that early time, when it  was a green field cloister-like and quiet,[22] divided by a small canal,  with a line of trees on each side; and extending between the two  churches of St. Theodore and St. Geminian, as the little piazza of  Torcello lies between its \"palazzo\" and cathedral.    Sec. IV. But in the year 813, when the seat of government was finally  removed to the Rialto, a Ducal Palace, built on the spot where the  present one stands, with a Ducal Chapel beside it,[23] gave a very  different character to the Square of St. Mark; and fifteen years later,  the acquisition of the body of the Saint, and its deposition in the  Ducal Chapel, perhaps not yet completed, occasioned the investiture of  that chapel with all possible splendor. St. Theodore was deposed from  his patronship, and his church destroyed, to make room for the  aggrandizement of the one attached to the Ducal Palace, and  thenceforward known as \"St. Mark's.\"[24]    Sec. V. This first church was however destroyed by fire, when the Ducal  Palace was burned in the revolt against Candiano, in 976. It was partly  rebuilt by his successor, Pietro Orseolo, on a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#13)"],[1,"tried: and we are shown that no suffering, no  self-examination, however honest, however stern, no searching out of the  heart by its own bitterness, is enough to convince man of his  nothingness before God; but that the sight of God's creation will do it.  For, when the Deity himself has willed to end the temptation, and to  accomplish in Job that for which it was sent, He does not vouchsafe to  reason with him, still less does He overwhelm him with terror, or  confound him by laying open before his eyes the book of his iniquities.  He opens before him only the arch of the dayspring, and the fountains of  the deep; and amidst the covert of the reeds, and on the heaving waves,  He bids him watch the kings of the children of pride,--\"Behold now  Behemoth, which I made with thee:\" And the work is done.    Sec. XXXII. Thus, if, I repeat, there is any one lesson in the whole book  which stands forth more definitely than another, it is this of the holy  and humbling influence of natural science on the human heart. And yet,  even here, it is not the science, but the perception, to which the good  is owing; and the natural sciences may become as harmful as any others,  when they lose themselves in classification and catalogue-making. Still,  the principal danger is with the sciences of words and methods; and it  was exactly into those sciences that the whole energy of men during the  Renaissance period was thrown. They discovered suddenly that the world  for ten centuries had been living in an ungrammatical manner, and they  made it forthwith the end of human existence to be grammatical. And it  mattered thenceforth nothing what was said, or what was done, so only  that it was said with scholarship, and done with system. Falsehood in a  Ciceronian dialect had no opposers; truth in patois no listeners. A  Roman phrase was thought worth any number of Gothic facts. The sciences  ceased at once to be anything more than different kinds of  grammars,--grammar of language, grammar of logic, grammar of ethics,  grammar of art; and the tongue, wit, and invention of the human race  were supposed to have found their utmost and most divine mission in  syntax and syllogism, perspective and five orders.    Of such knowledge as this, nothing but pride could come; and, therefore,  I have called the first mental characteristic of the Renaissance  schools, the \"pride\" of science. If they had reached any science worth  the name, they might have loved it; but of the paltry knowledge they  possessed, they could only be proud. There was not anything in it  capable of being loved. Anatomy, indeed, then first made a subject of  accurate study, is a true science, but not so attractive as to enlist  the affections strongly on its side: and therefore, like its meaner  sisters, it became merely a ground for pride; and the one main purpose  of the Renaissance artists, in all their work, was to show how much they  knew.    Sec. XXXIII. There were, of course, noble exceptions; but chiefly  belonging to the earliest periods of the Renaissance, when its teaching  had not yet produced its full effect. Raphael, Leonardo, and Michael  Angelo were all trained in the old school; they all had masters who knew  the true ends of art, and had reached them; masters nearly as great as  they were themselves, but imbued with the old religious and earnest  spirit, which their disciples receiving from them, and drinking at the  same time deeply from all the fountains of knowledge opened in their day,  became the world's wonders. Then the dull wondering world believed that  their greatness rose out of their new knowledge, instead of out of that  ancient religious root, in which to abide was life, from which to be  severed was annihilation. And from that day to this, they have tried to  produce Michael Angelos and Leonardos by teaching the barren sciences,  and still have mourned and marvelled that no more Michael Angelos came;  not perceiving that those great Fathers were only able to receive such  nourishment because they were rooted on the rock of all ages, and that  our scientific teaching, nowadays, is nothing more nor less than the  assiduous watering of trees whose stems are cut through. Nay, I have  even granted too much in saying that those great men were able to  receive pure nourishment from the sciences; for my own conviction is,  and I know it to be shared by most of those who love Raphael  truly,--that he painted best when he knew least. Michael Angelo was  betrayed, again and again, into such vain and offensive exhibition of  his anatomical knowledge as, to this day, renders his higher powers  indiscernible by the greater part of men; and Leonardo fretted his life  away in engineering, so that there is hardly a picture left to bear his  name. But, with respect to all who followed, there can be no question  that the science they possessed was utterly harmful; serving merely to  draw away their hearts at once from the purposes of art and the power of  nature, and to make, out of the canvas and marble, nothing more than  materials for the exhibition of petty dexterity and useless knowledge.    Sec. XXXIV. It is sometimes amusing to watch the naive and childish way  in which this vanity is shown. For instance, when perspective was first  invented, the world thought it a mighty discovery, and the greatest men  it had in it were as proud of knowing that retiring lines converge, as  if all the wisdom of Solomon had been compressed into a vanishing point.  And, accordingly, it became nearly impossible for any one to paint a  Nativity, but he must turn the stable and manger into a Corinthian  arcade, in order to show his knowledge of perspective; and half the best  architecture of the time, instead of being adorned with historical  sculpture, as of old, was set forth with bas-relief of minor corridors  and galleries, thrown into perspective.    Now that perspective can be taught to any schoolboy in a week, we can  smile at this vanity. But the fact is, that all pride in knowledge is  precisely as ridiculous, whatever its kind, or whatever its degree.  There is, indeed, nothing of which man has any right to be proud; but  the very last thing of which, with any show of reason, he can make his  boast is his knowledge, except only that infinitely small portion of it  which he has discovered for himself. For what is there to be more proud  of in receiving a piece of knowledge from another person, than in  receiving a piece of money? Beggars should not be proud, whatever kind  of alms they receive. Knowledge is like current coin. A man may have  some right to be proud of possessing it, if he has worked for the gold  of it, and assayed it, and stamped it, so that it may be received of  all men as true; or earned it fairly, being already assayed: but if he  has done none of these things, but only had it thrown in his face by a  passer-by, what cause has he to be proud? And though, in this mendicant  fashion, he had heaped together the wealth of Croesus, would pride any  more, for this, become him, as, in some sort, it becomes the man who has  labored for his fortune, however small? So, if a man tells me the sun is  larger than the earth, have I any cause for pride in knowing it? or, if  any multitude of men tell me any number of things, heaping all their  wealth of knowledge upon me, have I any reason to be proud under the  heap? And is not nearly all the knowledge of which we boast in these  days cast upon us in this dishonorable way; worked for by other men,  proved by them, and then forced upon us, even against our wills, and  beaten into us in our youth, before we have the wit even to know if it  be good or not? (Mark the distinction between knowledge and thought.)  Truly a noble possession to be proud of! Be assured, there is no part of  the furniture of a man's mind which he has a right to exult in, but that  which he has hewn and fashioned for himself. He who has built himself a  hut on a desert heath, and carved his bed, and table, and chair out of  the nearest forest, may have some right to take pride in the appliances  of his narrow chamber, as assuredly he will have joy in them. But the  man who has had a palace built, and adorned, and furnished for him, may,  indeed, have many advantages above the other, but he has no reason to be  proud of his upholsterer's skill; and it is ten to one if he has half  the joy in his couches of ivory that the other will have in his pallet  of pine.    Sec. XXXV. And observe how we feel this, in the kind of respect we pay to  such knowledge as we are indeed capable of estimating the value of. When  it is our own, and new to us, we cannot judge of it; but let it be  another's also, and long familiar to us, and see what value we set on  it. Consider how we regard a schoolboy, fresh from his term's labor. If  he begin to display his newly acquired small knowledge to us, and plume  himself thereupon, how soon do we silence him with contempt! But it is  not so if the schoolboy begins to feel or see anything. In the strivings  of his soul within him he is our equal; in his power of sight and  thought he stands separate from us, and may be a greater than we. We are  ready to hear him forthwith. \"You saw that? you felt that? No matter for  your being a child; let us hear.\"    Sec. XXXVI. Consider that every generation of men stands in this relation  to its successors. It is as the schoolboy: the knowledge of which it is  proudest will be as the alphabet to those who follow. It had better make  no noise about its knowledge; a time will come when its utmost, in that  kind, will be food for scorn. Poor fools! was that all they knew? and  behold how proud they were! But what we see and feel will never be  mocked at. All men will be thankful to us for telling them that.  \"Indeed!\" they will say, \"they felt that in their day? saw that? Would  God we may be like them, before we go to the home where sight and  thought are not!\"    This"]]]
