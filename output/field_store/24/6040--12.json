It is still further a story of the moral enormities and monstrosities of  the almost universal graft, \"the plants honeycombed with rottenness. The  bosses grafted off the men and they grafted off each other, and some day  the superintendent would find out about the boss, and then he would  graft off the boss.\"    When the men were set to perform some peculiarly immoral act, they would  say, \"Now we are working for the church,\" referring to the benefactions  of the proprietors to religious institutions.    It tells the story of the training of the children in vice, of girls  forced into immorality, so that a girl without virtue would stand a  better chance than a decent one. It is a tale of the terrible ending of  old Antanas by saltpeter poisoning; of Jonas, no one knows how, possibly  he fell into the vats; of little Kristoforas by convulsions; of little  Antanas by falling into a pit before the door of his house; of Marija,  in a house of shame; of Stanislovas, who was eaten by rats; and of  beautiful little Ona, to the description of whose ending no other than  the author's pen could do justice.    The book shows how men graft everywhere, not only in the packing house,  but how the slime of the serpent is over almost all of our modern  commercial and political practises.    No one can justly hold the meat kings responsible for all of this.    Nothing less than a thorough reconstruction of our whole social organism  will suffice. Palliative philanthropy is, as the author says, \"like  standing upon the brink of the pit of hell and throwing snow balls in to  lower the temperature.\"    \"The Jungle\" is the boiling over of our social volcano and shows us what  is in it. It is a danger signal!    We are all indicted and must stand our trial. There rests upon us the  obligation to ascertain the facts. The author of \"The Jungle\" lived in  Packingtown for months, and the eminently respectable publishers who are  now issuing the book sent a shrewd lawyer to Chicago to report as to  whether the statements in it were exaggerated, and his report confirmed  the assertions of the author.    This book is a call to immediate action.    The Lithuanian hero found his solution of the problems suggested in  Socialism. The solution lies either in that direction or in something  better, and it behooves those who warn us against Socialistic  experiments to tell us if they know of any other effective remedy.  Surely all thoughtful men should study these theories of social  redemption and learn why their advocates claim that putting them in  practice would modify or abolish the evils of our modern conditions.    \"The masters, lords and rulers of all lands,\" the thinkers and workers  of our time must speedily give themselves to the understanding and  application of some adequate remedy, or there will be blood, woe and  tears almost without end, \"when this dumb terror shall reply to God,  after the silence of the centuries.\"    FOOTNOTE:    [2] Genuine or not genuine: we live right now in a democracy. If, in  spite of that, such diabolical crimes as Sinclair describes them are  committed daily, then this only proves that democracy is no panacea for  them. Why should it, if criminals of the Armour kind realize profits out  of their wholesale poisoning of such dimensions that they can easily buy  all the glory of the people's sovereignty.--Editor.          THE GAME IS UP.    By SADAKICHI HARTMANN.      \"HELLO, Morrison, may I come in?\" The door stood slightly ajar.    Morrison came to the door--the complexion of his face was sallow and his  eyes had a peculiar look--he recognized his visitor, hesitated for a  moment whether he should admit him, then opened the door and made a sort  of mock courtesy.    \"Cleaning up?\" the tall, lean man asked as he entered the little hall  room.    \"Yes,\" and a wistful smile glided over Morrison's pale face; \"cleaning  up for good.\"    The room had a peculiar appearance. There was no disorder and yet a lot  of things were lying about; it looked as if the lodger intended to go  away on a long journey and had tried to straighten up matters previous  to his departure. The visitor gazed curiously about the room. He had a  strange foreboding, but forced himself to ask in a jocular mood: \"Going  to Egypt again?\"    \"Farther than that this time, but it won't take so long; the journey I  am contemplating will be over by to-morrow evening, I hope.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"The game is up.\"    The tall, lean man made no immediate reply, he merely gazed steadily  into the face of his friend. He had always suspected that it would come  to this some day. He really wondered that Morrison had not done it long  ago. If any man had a right to dispose of his life it was surely  Morrison. He had endured more than most human beings. His case was  absolutely hopeless.    \"Is there no way out of it?\"    Morrison shook his head. He wanted to say something, but his voice  failed him. He stepped to the dresser near the window, looked into the  mirror and arranged his faded, threadbare tie. It was pitiful to see how  shabbily he was dressed. He no longer set the fashion as in his days of  success, years ago in Boston.    \"Would money help you?\" and the tall, lean visitor fumbled in his  pockets. Although fairly well dressed, he was hard up most of the time  and only ventured to broach the subject as he just happened to have a  few dollars to spare that day.    \"No, what good would the little do that you could give me?\" and he  continued to adjust matters and tuck things away in his trunk.    \"There, you are right again, not much. But I won forty dollars on the  track; I sometimes go out there,\" he added as a sort of excuse, \"as it  is impossible to live on literature alone. I could spare ten.\"    \"Can you really spare them? I won't be able to return them, you know. I  would like to have them. I suppose you will refuse to let me buy a  revolver with them. I have all sorts of poisons,\" he pointed to some  little bottles, \"but I would prefer not to use them, it wouldn't be  esthetical, and then I want to go away to some place where nobody knows  me. I don't want to be identified.\"    The literary man slowly pulled a small roll out of his pocket. He  thought of his wife and children who needed the money. It was really  foolish to have made that offer. Well, it was probably the last service  he could render his friend. Morrison was serious about his departure,  there was no doubt about that. \"Here!\"    \"Thanks,\" Morrison answered, though he did not take the money right  away. He looked about absentmindedly, as in a dream. This was friendship  indeed. He had not believed that anybody could so completely enter  another man's state of mind. Not a word of opposition. This was  glorious! They had known each other for more than seventeen years. They  had often drifted apart and, somehow, had always met again. They had  never been very intimate, they had merely respected each other for the  work they had accomplished, each in his profession; although they  differed largely in ideas. Morrison was a sculptor, and almost an  ancient Greek in his feelings for the beauty of lines. The tall, lean  man, on the other hand, was a strange mixture of a visionary and brutal  realist. They both were cynics, however, that found life rather futile.  With the literary man this was merely a theoretical view point, while  Morrison was really embittered with life. The incidents of this  afternoon had surprised him. He was deeply moved and felt as if he  should give utterance to his emotions. He remembered that his attitude  towards his friend had been rather arrogant at times. He now felt sorry  for it, but somehow could not form his sentiments and thoughts into  coherent sentences.    \"Thanks,\" he simply repeated, \"Has anybody seen you enter the house?\"    \"No, the door was open and I walked right up. Why do you ask?\"    \"I don't want anybody to be mixed up in this affair, as it only concerns  me.\"    The literary man smiled: \"Could any man influence you one way or  another? As far as I can make out you are beyond mortal influence.\"    A pause ensued. Morrison threw the last thing into his trunk. \"Well, I  am ready. Everything is settled.\"    \"How about your statues?\"    \"Pshaw!\" Morrison shrugged his shoulders. \"Nobody was interested in them  while I lived. Why should I bother to think what might become of them  after my death?\"    The author nodded and scowled at the same time. He was not satisfied  with the answer. But there were still other things on his mind. He was  used to analyze everything to shreds and tatters. \"Are you not afraid  that you might make a botch out of the whole job?\"    Morrison weighed the question in his mind, then shook his head and  answered: \"No, there is hardly a chance for it now. I have been tuned up  to it, trained myself to it, so to speak. The fruit is ripe. It has to  fall. It would be awful, though--\" he added, with an after-thought. \"Do  you remember my emerald ring? I had to pawn it, but I kept the poison  which was hidden under the stone. I will take that if anything goes  wrong.\"    \"Would you object to my company?\" asked the tall, lean man, \"I mean  until all is over. I, myself, am not quite ready yet for any such  heroical performances.\"    \"Oh, don't think of it,\" the sculptor ejaculated; notwithstanding, the  tone of his voice indicated that he would not object, that he would even  prefer a traveling companion for the last few hours of his life.    \"Well, I'll go with you. Where are you going?\"    \"To New Haven. It's a nice trip.\" Morrison carefully brushed his hair  and clothes, there came a flush to his face as he realized how shabby  his clothes really were. The tall, lean man was delicate enough to look  away as if he had not noticed anything.    A few moments later they left the room. Morrison locked the door and  they went out into the street. They did not talk"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27348"],[0,"The 2007 CIA World Factbook (#13)"],[1,"the final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to  be delivered to the policymaker.    The three types of finished intelligence are: basic, current, and  estimative. Basic intelligence provides the fundamental and factual  reference material on a country or issue. Current intelligence  reports on new developments. Estimative intelligence judges probable  outcomes. The three are mutually supportive: basic intelligence is  the foundation on which the other two are constructed; current  intelligence continually updates the inventory of knowledge; and  estimative intelligence revises overall interpretations of country  and issue prospects for guidance of basic and current intelligence.  The World Factbook, The President's Daily Brief, and the National  Intelligence Estimates are examples of the three types of finished  intelligence.    The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities  since the days of George Washington but only since World War II have  they been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Three programs  have highlighted the development of coordinated basic intelligence  since that time: (1 ) the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies  (JANIS), (2 ) the National Intelligence Survey (NIS), and (3) The  World Factbook.    During World War II, intelligence consumers realized that the  production of basic intelligence by different components of the US  Government resulted in a great duplication of effort and conflicting  information. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought  home to leaders in Congress and the executive branch the need for  integrating departmental reports to national policymakers. Detailed  and coordinated information was needed not only on such major powers  as Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous  interest. In the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines  had to launch amphibious operations against many islands about which  information was unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities  resolved that the United States should never again be caught  unprepared.    In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of  Naval Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of  the Office of Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort  should be initiated. A steering committee was appointed on 27 April  1943 that recommended the formation of a Joint Intelligence Study  Publishing Board to assemble, edit, coordinate, and publish the  Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the first  interdepartmental basic intelligence program to fulfill the needs of  the US Government for an authoritative and coordinated appraisal of  strategic basic intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the  board published 34 JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war  effort, and numerous letters of commendation were received,  including a statement from Adm. Forrest Sherman, Chief of Staff,  Pacific Ocean Areas, which said, \"JANIS has become the indispensable  reference work for the shore-based planners.\"    The need for more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar  world was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author  on national security. He wrote in The Future of American Secret  Intelligence (Infantry Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world  leadership in peace requires even more elaborate intelligence than  in war. \"The conduct of peace involves all countries, all human  activities - not just the enemy and his war production.\"    The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and  officially began operating on 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October  1947, the Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational  responsibility for JANIS. On 13 January 1948, the National Security  Council issued Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 3, which  authorized the National Intelligence Survey (NIS) program as a  peacetime replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before adequate  NIS country sections could be produced, government agencies had to  develop more comprehensive gazetteers and better maps. The US Board  on Geographic Names (BGN) compiled the names; the Department of the  Interior produced the gazetteers; and CIA produced the maps.  The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the  structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in  1955 that: \"The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable  publication which provides the essential elements of basic  intelligence on all areas of the world. There will always be a  continuing requirement for keeping the Survey up-to-date.\" The  Factbook was created as an annual summary and update to the  encyclopedic NIS studies. The first classified Factbook was  published in August 1962, and the first unclassified version was  published in June 1971. The NIS program was terminated in 1973  except for the Factbook, map, and gazetteer components. The 1975  Factbook was the first to be made available to the public with sales  through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The Factbook was  first made available on the Internet in June 1997. The year 2007  marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Central  Intelligence Agency and the 64th year of continuous basic  intelligence support to the US Government by The World Factbook and  its two predecessor programs.
