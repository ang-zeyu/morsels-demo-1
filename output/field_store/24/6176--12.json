Bodily exercises likewise had a place in this  course of education, which was supposed to be complete when the children  had reached the age of fifteen. The majority of them were now sent back  to their families, while the rest stayed behind to become priests or  simple monks. For there were religious orders, under the patronage of  the different gods, and convents for either sex. The monastic rule was  often very severe. In many cases it involved abstinence from animal  food, and the people called the monks of these severer orders  _Quaquacuiltin_, or \"herb-eaters.\" There were likewise associations  resembling our half-secular, half-ecclesiastical fraternities. Thus we  hear of the society of the \"_Telpochtiliztli_,\" an association of young  people who lived with their families, but met every evening at sunset to  dance and sing in honour of Tezcatlipoca. And, finally, we know that  ancient Mexico had its hermits and its religious mendicants.[30] The  latter, however, only took the vow of mendicancy for a fixed term. These  are the details which led von Humboldt and some other writers to believe  that Buddhism must have penetrated at some former period into Mexico.  Not at all! What we have seen simply proves that asceticism, the war  against nature, everywhere clothes itself in similar forms, suggested by  the very constitution of man; and there is certainly nothing in common  between the gentle insipidity of Buddha's religion and the sanguinary  faith of the Aztecs.    The girls were under a rule similar to that of the boys. They led a hard  enough life in the convents set apart for them, fasting often, sleeping  without taking off their clothes, and (when it was their turn to be on  duty) getting up several times in the night to renew the incense that  burned perpetually before the gods. They learned to sew, to weave, and  to embroider the garments of the idols and the priests. It was they who  made the sacred cakes and the dough idols, whose place in the public  festivals I have described to you. At the age of fifteen, the same  selection took place among the girls as among the boys. Those who stayed  in the convent became either priestesses, charged with the lower  sacerdotal offices, or directresses of the convents set aside for  instruction, or simple nuns, who were known as _Cihuatlamacasque_, \"lady  deaconesses,\" or _Cihuaquaquilli_, \"lady herb-eaters,\" inasmuch as they  abstained from meat. The most absolute continence was rigorously  enforced, and breach of it was punished by death.[31]    One cannot but ask whether a priesthood so firmly organized, in which  was centred the whole intellectual life and all that can he called the  science of Mexico, had not elaborated any higher doctrines or cosmogonic  theories such as we owe to the priesthoods of the Old World, especially  when we know that they regulated the calendar, which presupposes some  astronomical conceptions.    But here we enter upon a region that has not yet been methodically  reclaimed by the historians. We have often enough been presented with  Mexican cosmogonies, but the fundamental error of all these expositions  is, that they present as a fixed and established body of doctrine what  was in reality a very loose and unformed mass of traditions and  speculations. The sponsors of these cosmogonies agree neither as to  their number nor their order of succession, and it is obvious that a  mistaken zeal to bring them as near as possible to the Biblical  tradition has been at work. An attempt has even been made to find a  Mexican Noah, coming out of the ark, in a fish-god emerging from a kind  of box floating on the waters.[32]    One thing, however, is certain, namely, that these cosmogonies are not  Aztec. The Aztec deities proper play no part in them. We may therefore  suppose that they are of Central American origin, or are due to that  priesthood of Quetzalcoatl which continued its silent work in the depths  of its mysterious retreats. The contradictions of our authorities as to  the number and order of these cosmogonies suggest the idea that their  arrangement one after another is no more than a harmonizing attempt to  bring various originally distinct cosmogonies into connection with each  other. The fact is that others yet are known, in addition to those which  have taken their place in what we may call the classical list  established by Humboldt and Mueller.[33] In this classical list there  are five ages of the world, separated from each other by universal  cataclysms, something after the fashion of the successive creations of  the school of Cuvier. Each of these ages is called a Sun, and, according  to the elements that preponderate during their respective courses, they  are called, 1st, the Sun of the Earth; 2nd, the Sun of Fire; 3rd, the  Sun of the Air; and 4th, the Sun of Water. The fifth Sun, which is the  present one, has no special name. We cannot enter upon the details  concerning each of these Suns, and they are not very interesting in any  case. They contain confused reminiscences of primitive life, of the  ancient populations of Anahuac, of old and bygone worships, but nothing  particularly characteristic or original. The only specially striking  feature in this mass of cosmogonic traditions is the sense of the  instability of the established order alike of nature and society which  pervades them. What was it that inspired the Mexicans with this feeling?  Perhaps the mighty destructive forces for which tropical countries,  equatorial seas and volcanic regions, so often furnish a theatre, had  shaken confidence in the permanence of the physical constitution of the  world. Perhaps the numerous political and social revolutions, the  frequent successions of peoples, rulers and subjects in turn, had  accustomed the mind to conceive and anticipate perpetual changes, of  which the successive ages of the world were but the supreme expression;  and finally, perhaps that quasi-messianic expectation of the return of  Quetzalcoatl, to be accompanied by a complete renewal of things, may  have given an additional point of attachment to this belief in the  caducity of the whole existing order. What is certain is that this  sentiment itself was very widely spread. It served as a consolation to  the peoples who were crushed beneath the cruel yoke of the Aztecs. They  might well cherish the thought that all this would not last for ever;  and even the Aztecs themselves had no unbounded confidence in the  stability of their empire. The Spaniards profited greatly by this vague  and all but universal distrust. After their victory they made much of  pretended prodigies that had shadowed it forth, and even of prophecies  that had announced it.[34] But the state of mind of the populations  concerned being given, at whatever moment the Spaniards had arrived they  would have been able to appeal to auguries of a like kind, by dint of  just giving them that degree of precision and clearness which usually  distinguishes predictions that are recorded after their fulfilment!    A further proof that the Mexican religion helped to spread this sense of  the instability of things is furnished by the grand jubilee festival  which was celebrated every fifty-two years in the city of Mexico and  throughout the empire. The Mexican cycle, marking the coincidence of  four times thirteen lunar and four times thirteen solar years,[35]  counted two-and-fifty years, and was called a \"sheaf of years.\" Now  whenever the dawn of the fifty-third year drew near, the question was  anxiously put, whether the world would last any longer, and preparations  were made for the great ceremony of the _Toxilmolpilia_, or \"binding up  of years.\" The day before, every fire was extinguished. All the priests  of the city of Mexico marched in procession to a mountain situated at  two leagues' distance. The entire population followed them. They watched  the Pleiades intently. If the world was to come to an end, if the sun  was never to rise again, the Pleiades would not pass the zenith; but the  moment they passed it, it was known that a new era of fifty-two years  had been guaranteed to men. Fire was kindled anew by the friction of  wood. But the wood rested on the bosom of the handsomest of the  prisoners, and the moment it was lighted the victim's body was opened,  his heart torn out, and both heart and body burned upon a pile that was  lit by the new fire. No sooner did the people, who had remained on the  plain below, perceive the flame ascend, than they broke into delirious  joy. Another fifty-two years was before the world. More victims were  sacrificed in gratitude to the gods. Brands were lighted at the sacred  flame on the mountain, from which the domestic fires were in their turn  kindled, and swift couriers were despatched with torches, replaced  continually on the route, to the very extremities of the empire. It was  in the year 1507, twelve years before Cortes disembarked, that the  Toxilmolpilia was celebrated for the last time. In 1559, although the  mass of the natives had meanwhile been converted to Roman Catholicism,  the Spanish government had to take severe measures to prevent its  repetition.[36]    We have far firmer footing, then, than is furnished by the shifting  ground of the cosmogonies, when we insist upon the general prevalence of  the feeling that the world might veritably come to an end as it had done  before. Beyond this there was nothing fixed or generally accepted. Much  the same might be said of the future life. The Mexicans believed in  man's survival after death. This we see from the practice of putting a  number of useful articles into the tomb by the side of the corpse, after  first breaking them, so that they too might die and their spirits might  accompany that of the departed to his new abodes. They"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34834"],[0,"A Text-Book of Astronomy (#13)"],[1,"have seen in a previous section, upon  the whole just balances the earth's attraction and keeps the moon from  falling into it. The effect of these forces is to stretch out the moon  along a line pointing toward the earth, just as the blocks were  stretched out along the line of the magnet, and to make this diameter of  the moon slightly but permanently longer than the others.    [Illustration: FIG. 24.--The tides.]    THE TIDES.--Similarly the moon and the sun attract opposite sides of the  earth with different forces and feebly tend to pull it out of shape. But  here a new element comes into play: the earth turns so rapidly upon its  axis that its solid parts have no time in which to yield sensibly to the  strains, which shift rapidly from one diameter to another as different  parts of the earth are turned toward the moon, and it is chiefly the  waters of the sea which respond to the distorting effect of the sun's  and moon's attraction. These are heaped up on opposite sides of the  earth so as to produce a slight elongation of its diameter, and Fig. 24  shows how by the earth's rotation this swelling of the waters is swept  out from under the moon and is pulled back by the moon until it finally  takes up some such position as that shown in the figure where the effect  of the earth's rotation in carrying it one way is just balanced by the  moon's attraction urging it back on line with the moon. This heaping up  of the waters is called a _tide_. If _I_ in the figure represents a  little island in the sea the waters which surround it will of course  accompany it in its diurnal rotation about the earth's axis, but  whenever the island comes back to the position _I_, the waters will  swell up as a part of the tidal wave and will encroach upon the land in  what is called high tide or flood tide. So too when they reach _I´´_,  half a day later, they will again rise in flood tide, and midway between  these points, at _I´_, the waters must subside, giving low or ebb tide.    The height of the tide raised by the moon in the open sea is only a very  few feet, and the tide raised by the sun is even less, but along the  coast of a continent, in bays and angles of the shore, it often happens  that a broad but low tidal wave is forced into a narrow corner, and then  the rise of the water may be many feet, especially when the solar tide  and the lunar tide come in together, as they do twice in every month, at  new and full moon. Why do they come together at these times instead of  some other?    Small as are these tidal effects, it is worth noting that they may in  certain cases be very much greater--e. g., if the moon were as massive  as is the sun its tidal effect would be some millions of times greater  than it now is and would suffice to grind the earth into fragments.  Although the earth escapes this fate, some other bodies are not so  fortunate, and we shall see in later chapters some evidence of their  disintegration.    43. THE SCOPE OF THE LAW OF GRAVITATION.--In all the domain of physical  science there is no other law so famous as the Newtonian law of  gravitation; none other that has been so dwelt upon, studied, and  elaborated by astronomers and mathematicians, and perhaps none that can  be considered so indisputably proved. Over and over again mathematical  analysis, based upon this law, has pointed out conclusions which, though  hitherto unsuspected, have afterward been found true, as when Newton  himself derived as a corollary from this law that the earth ought to be  flattened at the poles--a thing not known at that time, and not proved  by actual measurement until long afterward. It is, in fact, this  capacity for predicting the unknown and for explaining in minutest  detail the complicated phenomena of the heavens and the earth that  constitutes the real proof of the law of gravitation, and it is  therefore worth while to note that at the present time there are a very  few points at which the law fails to furnish a satisfactory account of  things observed. Chief among these is the case of the planet Mercury,  the long diameter of whose orbit is slowly turning around in a way for  which the law of gravitation as yet furnishes no explanation. Whether  this is because the law itself is inaccurate or incomplete, or whether  it only marks a case in which astronomers have not yet properly applied  the law and traced out its consequences, we do not know; but whether it  be the one or the other, this and other similar cases show that even  here, in its most perfect chapter, astronomy still remains an incomplete  science.          CHAPTER V    THE EARTH AS A PLANET      44. THE SIZE OF THE EARTH.--The student is presumed to have learned, in  his study of geography, that the earth is a globe about 8,000 miles in  diameter and, without dwelling upon the \"proofs\" which are commonly  given for these statements, we proceed to consider the principles upon  which the measurement of the earth's size and shape are based.    [Illustration: FIG. 25.--Measuring the size of the earth.]    In Fig. 25 the circle represents a meridian section of the earth; _P P´_  is the axis about which it rotates, and the dotted lines represent a  beam of light coming from a star in the plane of the meridian, and so  distant that the dotted lines are all practically parallel to each  other. The several radii drawn through the points _1_, _2_, _3_,  represent the direction of the vertical at these points, and the angles  which these radii produced, make with the rays of starlight are each  equal to the angular distance of the star from the zenith of the place  at the moment the star crosses the meridian. We have already seen, in  Chapter II, how these angles may be measured, and it is apparent from  the figure that the difference between any two of these angles--e. g.,  the angles at _1_ and _2_--is equal to the angle at the center, _O_,  between the points _1_ and _2_. By measuring these angular distances of  the star from the zenith, the astronomer finds the angles at the center  of the earth between the stations _1_, _2_, _3_, etc., at which his  observations are made. If the meridian were a perfect circle the change  of zenith distance of the star, as one traveled along a meridian from  the equator to the pole, would be perfectly uniform--the same number of  degrees for each hundred miles traveled--and observations made in many  parts of the earth show that this is very nearly true, but that, on the  whole, as we approach the pole it is necessary to travel a little  greater distance than is required for a given change in the angle at the  equator. The earth is, in fact, flattened at the poles to the amount of  about 27 miles in the length of its diameter, and by this amount, as  well as by smaller variations due to mountains and valleys, the shape of  the earth differs from a perfect sphere. These astronomical measurements  of the curvature of the earth's surface furnish by far the most  satisfactory proof that it is very approximately a sphere, and furnish  as its equatorial diameter 7,926 miles.    Neglecting the _compression_, as it is called, i. e., the 27 miles by  which the equatorial diameter exceeds the polar, the size of the earth  may easily be found by measuring the distance _1_--_2_ along the  surface and by combining with this the angle _1 O 2_ obtained through  measuring the meridian altitudes of any star as seen from _1_ and _2_.  Draw on paper an angle equal to the measured difference of altitude and  find how far you must go from its vertex in order to have the distance  between the sides, measured along an arc of a circle, equal to the  measured distance between _1_ and _2_. This distance from the vertex  will be the earth's radius.    EXERCISE 19.--Measure the diameter of the earth by the method given  above. In order that this may be done satisfactorily, the two stations  at which observations are made must be separated by a considerable  distance--i. e., 200 miles. They need not be on the same meridian, but  if they are on different meridians in place of the actual distance  between them, there must be used the projection of that distance upon  the meridian--i. e., the north and south part of the distance.    By co-operation between schools in the Northern and Southern States,  using a good map to obtain the required distances, the diameter of the  earth may be measured with the plumb-line apparatus described in Chapter  II and determined within a small percentage of its true value.    45. THE MASS OF THE EARTH.--We have seen in Chapter IV the possibility  of determining the masses of the planets as fractional parts of the  sun's mass, but nothing was there shown, or could be shown, about  measuring these masses after the common fashion in kilogrammes or tons.  To do this we must first get the mass of the earth in tons or  kilogrammes, and while the principles involved in this determination are  simple enough, their actual application is delicate and difficult.    [Illustration: FIG. 26.--Illustrating the principles involved in  weighing the earth.]    In Fig. 26 we suppose a long plumb line to be suspended above the  surface of the earth and to be attracted toward the center of the earth,  _C_, by a force whose intensity is (Chapter IV)        F = k mE/R^{2},    where _E_ denotes the mass of the earth, which is to be determined by  experiment, and _R_ is the radius of the earth, 3,963 miles. If there is  no disturbing influence present, the plumb line will point directly  downward, but if a massive ball of lead or other heavy substance is  placed at one side, _1_, it will attract the plumb line with a force  equal to        f = k mB/r^{2},    where _r_ is the distance of its center from the plumb bob and _B_ is  its mass which we may suppose, for illustration, to be a ton. In  consequence of this attraction the plumb line will be pulled a little to  one side, as shown by the dotted line, and if we represent by _l_"]]]
