I got through the rifle-fire down to the bayonet       charge on the hillside, when I felt a sting in the left arm,       and looking down, found I was shot in the wrist. In changing my       position I got shot in the centre of the forehead. The bullet       did not go straight through. It glanced off my nose-bone, and       came out above my right temple.... On looking round, I was just       in time to see the blood squirt from the first wound. I shifted       my position in quick time, for I did not want another from the       same rifle. I lay still after doing this for a while, when the       thought came to me to get my wrist bandaged and try to shoot       again. On changing my position I got a bullet right in the       'napper.' I was out of action then, for all was dark. I heard       the officer I was going to get the bandages from say, 'Poor       chap! he's gone.' But no, I am still kicking.\"                              THE RETREAT FROM DUNDEE    Owing to the Boers having posted their 15-centimetre gun on the Impati  for the purpose of shelling the camp and town, the troops and  inhabitants removed to a position some three miles south of Dundee  village. The movement was fraught with many discomforts. Rain fell in  torrents, making the roads a mass of slush and enveloping everything in  a thick mist, while provisions, which had been hastily gathered  together, were scarce. On the following day, Sunday, an attempt was made  to return to camp, but the Boer firing continued so active that the  project had to be abandoned. Thereupon, on Sunday night the whole  column, having first loaded four days' supplies from their old camp and  set there lighted candles sufficient to cause such an illumination as  would suggest to the Boers an idea of occupation, quietly stole away. No  one exactly knew their destination. At nine of the clock the Army  Service Corps waggons moved to the camp, were loaded, and by midnight  commenced rumbling along in the damp obscurity. The advance column,  after passing through Dundee, where it was joined by transport and  rearguard, proceeded along the Helpmakaar road on the way to  Ladysmith.    [Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL SIR W. PENN SYMONS, K.C.B.    Photo by R. Stanley & Co., London.]    On Monday afternoon the first halt was called, but the rest was of short  duration, for at ten the column was again plodding along through the  miry roads in hourly dread lest the whole scheme should be spoilt, and  the Boers suddenly arrest the course of the two-mile-long column.    And they had indeed good reason for alarm. They were forced to plod  through a narrow pass in the Biggarsberg range of mountains, so narrow  indeed that a hundred Boers might have effectually barred their way.  Here, through this perilous black cylinder of the hills, they marched at  dead of night. It took them between the hours of half-past eleven till  three, stumbling and squelching in the mire, and knowing that should the  enemy appear, should they but shoot one of the oxen of the leading  waggon of the convoy, and thus block the cramped defile, all chance of  getting safely through to Ladysmith would be at an end. This was by no  means a happy reflection to fill men's minds in the dripping, almost  palpable, darkness of the night, and the resolute spirit of the gallant  fellows who unmurmuringly stowed away all personal wretchedness and  stuck manfully to their grim duty is for ever to be marvelled at and  admired. Fortunately the Dutchmen, \"slim\" as they were, had not counted  on the possibility of this march being executed at all, still less of  its being executed in pitch darkness. They were caught napping, and the  party, who had left kit, provisions (except for the four days), and  everything behind them, who were now drenched to the skin in the only  clothes they possessed, at last reached Sunday River in safety.    Here they eagerly awaited an escort of the 5th Lancers, which had been  detached by Sir George White from Ladysmith to meet them. These, to the  great joy of the worn-out travellers, appeared on Wednesday afternoon.  On that evening the column again started off for a last long wearisome  tramp, the men, who had not been out of their clothes for a week, being  now ready to drop from sleeplessness and exhaustion. But valiantly they  held on. Not a word, not a grumble. All had confidence in General Yule  and his officers, who shared with the men every hardship and every  fatigue; each realised his individual duty to make the very best of a  very bad job, and pluckily kept heart till the last moment. Torrents of  rain fell, making the night into one vast immensity of slough and pool,  but the stumbling, straining left, right, left, right, of the retreating  men continued ceaselessly through the weary hours. On Thursday morning,  the 26th, to their intense relief, they found themselves at last in the  long-looked-for camp at Ladysmith.    The excitement of arrival was almost too much for the exhausted,  fainting troops, but the cheers that went up from a thousand throats  brought light to their sleep-starved eyes and warmth to their chilled  frames. There was rest at last--rest and safety, food and warm covering,  though of a more practical than artistic kind. The Devons--who had just  come grandly through the fight at Elandslaagte and looted the Boer camp  of innumerable saleable odds and ends--out of their newly-gained wealth  \"stood treat.\" In the joy of their hearts each of the men subscribed  sixpence, and the gallant Dublin Fusiliers, the heroes of Glencoe, who,  all unwashed and unshorn, now looked like chimney-sweeps rather than the  warriors they were, were invited to a fine \"square meal.\" It is  difficult to imagine the condition of those battered braves after their  week of hardship, fighting, and privation, and sticklers for etiquette  would have been shocked at the manners and customs enforced by warlike  conditions. One who dined with the Dundee column gave the following  graphic description of the luxurious repast:--    \"To begin with, there was no sort of furniture either in the messroom or  the anteroom. If you wanted to sit down, you did so on the floor. We  each got hold of a large tin mug, and dipped it into a large tin  saucepan of soup and drank it, spoons not existing. A large lump of salt  was passed round, and every one broke off a piece with his fingers. Next  you clawed hold of a piece of bread and a chunk of tongue, and gnawed  first one and then the other--knives and forks there were none. This  finished the dinner. Add to this two or three tallow-candles stuck on a  cocoa tin, and the fact that none of the officers had shaved, or had had  their clothes off for a week, and had walked some forty-five miles  through rivers and mud, and you will have some idea of how the officers'  mess of one of the smartest of Her Majesty's foot regiments do for  themselves in time of war. Not a murmur or complaint was to be heard.\"    Their state must certainly have been pitiable, for it will be remembered  that on the retirement from Dundee rations for four days only were  loaded, and provisions for two months, besides all officers' and men's  kit and hospital equipment, were left behind.    And, sad to say, so also were the wounded. It was necessary for their  future well-being to desert them. The men who had so gloriously led to  victory now found themselves stranded and in a strange position--the  vanquishers at the mercy of the vanquished! Most melancholy of all must  have been the plight of those unhappy sufferers when they first learnt  that their comrades were marching farther and farther away, and that  they, in all their helplessness, must be left lonely--unloved, and  perhaps untended--in charge of the enemy. One dares not think of the  agonies of those sad souls--the nation's invalids--bereft of kindly  words and kindred smiles; one cannot linger without a sense of  emasculating weakness on the sad side-picture of battle that, in its  dumb wretchedness, seems so much more paralysing than the active horror  of facing shot and shell in company with glorious comrades in arms. Let  us hope there was some one to whisper to them, to persuade them that all  was for the best; that the safety of their sick selves and their sound  mates depended on this retreat, this wondrous retreat which, when the  tale of the war in its entirety shall be told, will shine like a  dazzling light among records whose brilliancy in the history of British  achievements cannot be excelled. Perhaps, too, they had faith to inspire  them with the certainty that all that they had suffered in that dark  hour for their country and for the weal of their fellows, would be  remembered to their glory in the good times to come.    While the retreat was going forward Glencoe's gallant hero was breathing  his last. After hopelessly lingering for three days, General Sir W. Penn  Symons passed away. He expired in the hands of the enemy at Dundee  hospital on Monday the 23rd of October. The next day he was quietly  buried with profound signs of mourning.                             SIR W. PENN SYMONS--GLENCOE    By the death of Major-General Sir William Penn Symons, the British army  lost a brilliant and distinguished soldier, and a man of great valour  and courage. He came of a Cornish family, the founder of which was a  Norman knight who came over with William the Conqueror. The eldest son  of the late William Symons, Recorder of Saltash, he was born in 1843,  and in 1863 joined the South Wales Borderers--the old 24th Regiment. He  became lieutenant in 1866, captain in 1878, major in 1881,  lieutenant-colonel in 1886, and colonel in 1887.    His first experience of active service was in 1877, when the Borderers  took the field against the Galekas. In the Zulu War of 1879 he served  with distinction, but was not present at the battle of Isandlwana, being  away from his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26323"],[0,"The Suffrage Cook Book (#13)"],[1,"oven.

Add the yolks of the 4 eggs and beat well. Add  juice and rind of lemon. Then flour, into which has been sifted the  baking powder. Sift flour and baking powder twice before adding to  mixture. Use enough flour to make a very stiff batter, add cocoanut, and  last, fold in the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth.    Drop on buttered tins and bake in moderate oven.          PASTRIES, PIES, ETC.      Grape Fruit Pie    First bake a shell as for lemon pie, then make a filling as follows: Mix  one tablespoon of cornstarch in a little cold water, and over this pour  one cupful of boiling water. To this add the juice of two grapefruits,  the grated rind and juice of one orange, the beaten yolks of two eggs,  and the white of one, and a small piece of butter. Put all in the double  boiler and cook until thick, stirring all the time. When done, put in  the shell. Now beat up the white of the second egg with one-half a  cupful of sugar until thick, and spread with a knife over the pie. Put  in the oven and let brown lightly. Serve cold. This makes a delicious  pie.      Spice Pie    The yolks of three eggs, one and one-half cupfuls of sugar, one cupful  of cream, two tablespoons of flour, two-thirds of a cupful of butter,  one teaspoon of spice, cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg.    Mix the flour and sugar together, then cream with the butter. Add the  yolks of the eggs, beating thoroughly. Next add cream and spices. Use  the whites for the frosting.
