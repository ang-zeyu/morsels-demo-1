Economic    considerations have played second fiddle to political and military    upheavals during more than two decades of war, including the nearly    10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989).    During that conflict, one-third of the population fled the country,    with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak of 4 to 6 million    refugees. Gross domestic product has fallen substantially over the    past 20 years because of the loss of labor and capital and the    disruption of trade and transport; severe drought added to the    nation's difficulties in 1998-2002. The majority of the population    continues to suffer from insufficient food, clothing, housing, and    medical care, and a dearth of jobs, problems exacerbated by    political uncertainties and the general level of lawlessness.    International efforts to rebuild Afghanistan were addressed at the    Tokyo Donors Conference for Afghan Reconstruction in January 2002,    when $4.5 billion was pledged, $1.7 billion for 2002. Of that    approximately $900 million was directed to humanitarian aid - food,    clothing, and shelter - and another $90 million for the Afghan    Transitional Authority. Further World Bank and other aid came in    2003. Priority areas for reconstruction include upgrading education,    health, and sanitation facilities; providing income generating    opportunities; enhancing administrative and security arrangements,    especially in regional areas; developing the agricultural sector;    rebuilding transportation, energy, and telecommunication    infrastructure; and reabsorbing 2 million returning refugees. The    replacement of the opium trade - which may account for one-third of    GDP - and the search for oil and gas resources in the northern    region are two major long-term issues.

For example, in Asia the  Factbook has Burma as the country name, but in other publications  Myanmar is used; also, the Factbook uses Sea of Japan whereas other  publications label it East Sea. What is your policy on naming  geographic features?    The Factbook staff follows the guidance of the United States Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is the component of the United States  Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures governing  the spelling, use, and application of geographic names--domestic,  foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all departments  and agencies of the US Government to have access to uniform names of  geographic features. The position of the BGN is that the names Burma  and Sea of Japan be used in official US Government maps and  publications.    Why is most of the statistical information in the Factbook given in  metric units, rather than the units standard to US measure?    US Federal agencies are required by the Metric Conversion Act of 1975  (Public Law 94-168) and by Executive Order 12770 of July 1991 to use  the International System of Units, commonly referred to as the metric  system or SI. In addition, the metric system is used by over 95 percent  of the world's population.    Why don't you include information on minimum and maximum temperature  extremes?    The Factbook staff judges that this information would only be useful  for some (generally smaller) countries. Larger countries can have large  temperature extremes that do not represent the landmass as a whole. In  the future, such a category may be adopted listing the extremes, but  also adding a normal temperature range found throughout most of a  country's territory.    What information sources are used for the country flags?    Flag designs used in The World Factbook are those recognized by the  protocol office of the US Department of State.    Why do your GDP (Gross Domestic Product) statistics differ from other  sources?    GDP dollar estimates in The World Factbook are derived from purchasing  power parity (PPP) calculations. See the Notes and Definitions section  on GDP methodology for more information.    On the CIA Web site, Chiefs of State is updated weekly, but the last  update for the Factbook was an earlier date. Why the discrepancy?    Although Chiefs of State and The World Factbook both appear on the CIA  Web site, they are produced and updated by separate staffs. Chiefs of  State includes fewer countries but more leaders, and is updated more  frequently than The World Factbook, which has a much larger database,  and includes all countries.    Some percentage distributions do not add to 100. Why not?    Because of rounding, percentage distributions do not always add  precisely to 100%. Rounding of numbers always results in a loss of  precision--i.e., error. This error becomes apparent when percentage data  are totaled, as the following two examples show:                      Original Data        Rounded to whole integer      Example 1       43.2                 43                    30.4                 30                    26.4                 26                    ----                 --                   100.0                 99      Example 2       42.8                 43                    31.6                 32                    25.6                 26                    ----                 --                   100.0                101    When this occurs, we do not force the numbers to add exactly to 100,  because doing so would introduce additional error into the  distribution.    What rounding convention does The World Factbook use?    In deciding on the number of digits to present, the Factbook staff  assesses the accuracy of the original data and the needs of US  Government officials. All of the economic data are processed by  computer--either at the source or by the Factbook staff. The economic  data presented in The Factbook, therefore, follow the rounding  convention used by virtually all numerical software applications,  namely, any digit followed by a \"5\" is rounded up to the next higher  digit, no matter whether the original digit is even or odd. Thus, for  example, when rounded to the nearest integer, 2.5 becomes 3, rather  than 2, as occurred in some pre-computer rounding systems.      Technical    Does The World Factbook comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation  Act regarding accessibility of Web pages?    The World Factbook home page has a link entitled \"Text/Low Bandwidth  Version.\" The country data in the text version is fully accessible. We  believe The World Factbook is compliant with the Section 508 law in  both fact and spirit. If you are experiencing difficulty, please use  our comment form to provide us details of the specific problem you are  experiencing and the assistive software and/or hardware that you are  using so that we can work with our technical support staff to find and  implement a solution. We welcome visitors' suggestions to improve  accessibility of The World Factbook and the CIA Web site.    I am using the Factbook online and it is not working. What is wrong?    Hundreds of \"Factbook\" look-alikes exist on the Internet. The Factbook  site at: www.cia.gov is the only official site.    When I attempt to download a PDF (Portable Document Format) map file  (or some other map) the file has no image. Can you fix this?    Some of the files on The World Factbook Web site are large and could  take several minutes to download on a dial-up connection. The screen  might be blank during the download process.    When I open a map on The World Factbook site, it is fuzzy or granular,  or too big or too small. Why?    Adjusting the resolution setting on your monitor should correct this  problem.    Is The World Factbook country data available in machine-readable  format? All I can find is HTML, but I'm looking for simple tabular  data.    The Factbook Web site now features \"Rank Order\" pages for selected  Factbook entries. \"Rank Order\" pages are available for those data  fields identified with a small bar chart icon located next to the title  of the data entry. In addition, all of the \"Rank Order\" pages can be  downloaded as tab-delimited data files that can be opened in other  applications such as spreadsheets and databases.

The Soviet Union invaded in 1979, but was forced to withdraw 10    years later by anti-Communist mujahidin forces. The Communist regime    in Kabul collapsed in 1992. Fighting that subsequently erupted among    the various mujahidin factions eventually helped to spawn the    Taliban, a hardline Pakistani-sponsored movement that fought to end    the warlordism and civil war which gripped the country. The Taliban    seized Kabul in 1996 and were able to capture most of the country    outside of Northern Alliance srongholds primarily in the northeast.    Following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, a US, Allied, and    Northern Alliance military action toppled the Taliban for sheltering    Osama BIN LADIN. In late 2001, a conference in Bonn, Germany,    established a process for political reconstruction that ultimately    resulted in the adoption of a new constitution and presidential    election in 2004. On 9 October 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first    democratically elected president of Afghanistan. The new Afghan    government's next task is to hold National Assembly elections,    tentatively scheduled for April 2005.
