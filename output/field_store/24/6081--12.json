Tell them we are coming and        to turn out the town. Arm everybody. Have them down on        the wharf to meet us or we are gone gooses.    \"Now make it good and fast to that marlinspike, and stand by to toss  it ashore.\"    I did as he directed. By then we were close to Antioch. The wind was  shouting through our rigging, the _Mary Rebecca_ was half over on her  side and rushing ahead like an ocean greyhound. The seafaring folk of  Antioch had seen us breaking out topsail and staysail, a most reckless  performance in such weather, and had hurried to the wharf-ends in  little groups to find out what was the matter.    Straight down the water front we boomed, Charley edging in till a man  could almost leap ashore. When he gave the signal I tossed the  marlinspike. It struck the planking of the wharf a resounding smash,  bounced along fifteen or twenty feet, and was pounced upon by the  amazed onlookers.    It all happened in a flash, for the next minute Antioch was behind and  we were heeling it up the San Joaquin toward Merryweather, six miles  away. The river straightened out here into its general easterly  course, and we squared away before the wind, wing-and-wing once more,  the foresail bellying out to starboard.    Ole Ericsen seemed sunk into a state of stolid despair. Charley and  the two sailors were looking hopeful, as they had good reason to be.  Merryweather was a coal-mining town, and, it being Sunday, it was  reasonable to expect the men to be in town. Further, the coal-miners  had never lost any love for the Greek fishermen, and were pretty  certain to render us hearty assistance.    We strained our eyes for a glimpse of the town, and the first sight we  caught of it gave us immense relief. The wharves were black with men.  As we came closer, we could see them still arriving, stringing down  the main street, guns in their hands and on the run. Charley glanced  astern at the fishermen with a look of ownership in his eye which till  then had been missing. The Greeks were plainly overawed by the display  of armed strength and were putting their own rifles away.    We took in topsail and staysail, dropped the main peak, and as we got  abreast of the principal wharf jibed the mainsail. The _Mary Rebecca_  shot around into the wind, the captive fishermen describing a great  arc behind her, and forged ahead till she lost way, when lines were  flung ashore and she was made fast. This was accomplished under a  hurricane of cheers from the delighted miners.    Ole Ericsen heaved a great sigh. \"Ay never tank Ay see my wife never  again,\" he confessed.    \"Why, we were never in any danger,\" said Charley.    Ole looked at him incredulously.    \"Sure, I mean it,\" Charley went on. \"All we had to do, any time, was  to let go our end--as I am going to do now, so that those Greeks can  untangle their nets.\"    He went below with a monkey-wrench, unscrewed the nut, and let the  hook drop off. When the Greeks had hauled their nets into their boats  and made everything ship-shape, a posse of citizens took them off our  hands and led them away to jail.    \"Ay tank Ay ban a great big fool,\" said Ole Ericsen. But he changed  his mind when the admiring townspeople crowded aboard to shake hands  with him, and a couple of enterprising newspaper men took photographs  of the _Mary Rebecca_ and her captain.          VI    DEMETRIOS CONTOS      It must not be thought, from what I have told of the Greek fishermen,  that they were altogether bad. Far from it. But they were rough men,  gathered together in isolated communities and fighting with the  elements for a livelihood. They lived far away from the law and its  workings, did not understand it, and thought it tyranny. Especially  did the fish laws seem tyrannical. And because of this, they looked  upon the men of the fish patrol as their natural enemies.    We menaced their lives, or their living, which is the same thing, in  many ways. We confiscated illegal traps and nets, the materials of  which had cost them considerable sums and the making of which required  weeks of labor. We prevented them from catching fish at many times and  seasons, which was equivalent to preventing them from making as good a  living as they might have made had we not been in existence. And when  we captured them, they were brought into the courts of law, where  heavy cash fines were collected from them. As a result, they hated us  vindictively. As the dog is the natural enemy of the cat, the snake of  man, so were we of the fish patrol the natural enemies of the  fishermen.    But it is to show that they could act generously as well as hate  bitterly that this story of Demetrios Contos is told. Demetrios Contos  lived in Vallejo. Next to Big Alec, he was the largest, bravest, and  most influential man among the Greeks. He had given us no trouble,  and I doubt if he would ever have clashed with us had he not invested  in a new salmon boat. This boat was the cause of all the trouble. He  had had it built upon his own model, in which the lines of the general  salmon boat were somewhat modified.    To his high elation he found his new boat very fast--in fact, faster  than any other boat on the bay or rivers. Forthwith he grew proud and  boastful: and, our raid with the _Mary Rebecca_ on the Sunday salmon  fishers having wrought fear in their hearts, he sent a challenge up to  Benicia. One of the local fishermen conveyed it to us; it was to the  effect that Demetrios Contos would sail up from Vallejo on the  following Sunday, and in the plain sight of Benicia set his net and  catch salmon, and that Charley Le Grant, patrolman, might come and get  him if he could. Of course Charley and I had heard nothing of the new  boat. Our own boat was pretty fast, and we were not afraid to have a  brush with any other that happened along.    Sunday came. The challenge had been bruited abroad, and the fishermen  and seafaring folk of Benicia turned out to a man, crowding Steamboat  Wharf till it looked like the grand stand at a football match. Charley  and I had been sceptical, but the fact of the crowd convinced us that  there was something in Demetrios Contos's dare.    In the afternoon, when the sea-breeze had picked up in strength, his  sail hove into view as he bowled along before the wind. He tacked a  score of feet from the wharf, waved his hand theatrically, like a  knight about to enter the lists, received a hearty cheer in return,  and stood away into the Straits for a couple of hundred yards. Then he  lowered sail, and, drifting the boat sidewise by means of the wind,  proceeded to set his net. He did not set much of it, possibly fifty  feet; yet Charley and I were thunderstruck at the man's effrontery. We  did not know at the time, but we learned afterward, that the net he  used was old and worthless. It _could_ catch fish, true; but a catch  of any size would have torn it to pieces.    Charley shook his head and said:    \"I confess, it puzzles me. What if he has out only fifty feet? He  could never get it in if we once started for him. And why does he come  here anyway, flaunting his law-breaking in our faces? Right in our  home town, too.\"    Charley's voice took on an aggrieved tone, and he continued for some  minutes to inveigh against the brazenness of Demetrios Contos.    In the meantime, the man in question was lolling in the stern of his  boat and watching the net floats. When a large fish is meshed in a  gill-net, the floats by their agitation advertise the fact. And they  evidently advertised it to Demetrios, for he pulled in about a dozen  feet of net, and held aloft for a moment, before he flung it into the  bottom of the boat, a big, glistening salmon. It was greeted by the  audience on the wharf with round after round of cheers. This was more  than Charley could stand.    \"Come on, lad,\" he called to me; and we lost no time jumping into our  salmon boat and getting up sail.    The crowd shouted warning to Demetrios, and as we darted out from the  wharf we saw him slash his worthless net clear with a long knife. His  sail was all ready to go up, and a moment later it fluttered in the  sunshine. He ran aft, drew in the sheet, and filled on the long tack  toward the Contra Costa Hills.    By this time we were not more than thirty feet astern. Charley was  jubilant. He knew our boat was fast, and he knew, further, that in  fine sailing few men were his equals. He was confident that we should  surely catch Demetrios, and I shared his confidence. But somehow we  did not seem to gain.    It was a pretty sailing breeze. We were gliding sleekly through the  water, but Demetrios was slowly sliding away from us. And not only was  he going faster, but he was eating into the wind a fraction of a point  closer than we. This was sharply impressed upon us when he went about  under the Contra Costa Hills and passed us on the other tack fully one  hundred feet dead to windward.    \"Whew!\" Charley exclaimed. \"Either that boat is a daisy, or we've got  a five-gallon coal-oil can fast to our keel!\"    It certainly looked it one way or the other. And by the time  Demetrios made the Sonoma Hills, on the other side of the Straits, we  were so hopelessly outdistanced that Charley told me to slack off the  sheet, and we squared away for Benicia. The fishermen on Steamboat  Wharf showered us with ridicule when we returned and tied up. Charley  and I got out and walked away, feeling rather sheepish, for it is a  sore stroke to one's pride when he thinks he has a good boat and knows  how to sail it, and another man comes along and beats him.    Charley mooned over it for a couple of days; then word was brought to  us, as before, that on the next Sunday Demetrios Contos would repeat  his performance. Charley roused himself. He had our boat out of the  water,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28696"],[0,"Symbolic Logic (#13)"],[1,"Tables.
