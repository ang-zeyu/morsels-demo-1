The light from that  part of the spectrum, though it is invisible to the eye, is much more  active photographically than the light from the red, yellow, or green  parts of the spectrum. The front slit is adjusted so that the K line  falls upon the second slit, and as the front slit is slowly swept by  clockwork over the whole of a prominence, the second slit keeps pace  with it by a mechanical contrivance.    If the image of the solar disc is hidden by a screen of exactly the  proper size, the slits may be made to sweep over the whole sun, thus  giving us at one exposure a picture of the chromospheric ring round the  sun's limb with its prominences. The screen may now be withdrawn, and  the slits may be made to sweep rapidly over the disc itself. They reveal  the existence of glowing calcium vapours in many parts of the surface of  the sun. Thus we get a striking picture of the sun as drawn by this  particular light. In this manner Professor Hale confirmed the  observation made long before by Professor Young, that the spectra of  faculae always show the two great calcium bands.    The velocity with which a prominence shoots upward from the sun's limb  can, of course, be measured directly by observations of the ordinary  kind with a micrometer. The spectroscope, however, enables us to  estimate the speed with which disturbances at the surface of the sun  travel in the direction towards the earth or from the earth. We can  measure this speed by watching the peculiar behaviour of the spectral  lines representing the rapidly moving masses. This opens up a remarkable  line of investigation with important applications in many branches of  astronomy.    It is, of course, now generally understood that the sensation of light  is caused by waves or undulations which impinge on the retina of the  eye after having been transmitted through that medium which we call the  ether. To the different colours correspond different wave-lengths--that  is to say, different distances between two successive waves. A beam of  white light is formed by the union of innumerable different waves whose  lengths have almost every possible value lying between certain limits.  The wave-length of red light is such that there are 33,000 waves in an  inch, while that of violet light is but little more than half that of  red light. The position of a line in the spectrum depends solely on the  wave-length of the light to which it is due. Suppose that the source of  light is approaching directly towards the observer; obviously the waves  follow each other more closely than if the source were at rest, and the  number of undulations which his eye receives in a second must be  proportionately increased. Thus the distance between two successive  ether waves will be very slightly diminished. A well-known phenomenon of  a similar character is the change of pitch of the whistle of a  locomotive engine as it rushes past. This is particularly noticeable if  the observer happens to be in a train which is moving rapidly in the  opposite direction. In the case of sound, of course, the vibrations or  waves take place in the air and not in the ether. But the effect of  motion to or from the observer is strictly analogous in the two cases.  As, however, light travels 186,000 miles a second, the source of light  will also have to travel with a very high velocity in order to produce  even the smallest perceptible change in the position of a spectral line.    We have already seen that enormously high velocities are by no means  uncommon in some of these mighty disturbances on the sun; accordingly,  when we examine the spectrum of a sun-spot, we often see that some of  the lines are shifted a little towards one end of the spectrum and  sometimes towards the other, while in other cases the lines are seen to  be distorted or twisted in the most fantastic manner, indicating very  violent local commotions. If the spot happens to be near the centre of  the sun's disc, the gases must be shooting upwards or downwards to  produce these changes in the lines. The velocities indicated in  observations of this class sometimes amount to as much as two or even  three hundred miles per second. We find it difficult to conceive the  enormous internal pressures which are required to impel such mighty  masses of gases aloft from the photosphere with speeds so terrific, or  the conditions which bring about the downrush of such gigantic masses of  vapour from above. In the spectra of the prominences on the sun's limb  also we often see the bright lines bent or shifted to one side. In such  cases what we witness is evidently caused by movements along the surface  of the chromosphere, conveying materials towards us or away from us.    An interesting application of this beautiful method of measuring the  speed of moving bodies has been made in various attempts to determine  the period of rotation of the sun spectroscopically. As the sun turns  round on its axis, a point on the eastern limb is moving towards the  observer and a point on the western limb is moving away from him. In  each case the velocity is a little over a mile per second. At the  eastern limb the lines in the solar spectrum are very slightly shifted  towards the violet end of the spectrum, while the lines in the spectrum  of the western limb are equally shifted towards the red end. By an  ingenious optical contrivance it is possible to place the spectra from  the two limbs side by side, which doubles the apparent displacement, and  thus makes it much more easy to measure. Even with this contrivance the  visual quantities to be measured remain exceedingly minute. All the  parts of the instrument have to be most accurately adjusted, and the  observations are correspondingly delicate. They have been attempted by  various observers. Among the most successful investigations of this kind  we may mention that of the Swedish astronomer, Duner, who, by pointing  his instrument to a number of places on the limb, found values in good  agreement with the peculiar law of rotation which has been deduced from  the motion of sun-spots. This result is specially interesting, as it  shows that the atmospheric layers, in which that absorption takes place  which produces the dark lines in the spectrum, shares in the motion of  the photosphere at the same latitude.    [Illustration: Fig. 20.--View of the Corona (and a Comet) in a Total  Eclipse.]    [Illustration: PLATE V.    TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE, JULY 29TH, 1878.    THE CORONA FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHS.    (HARKNESS.)]    We have yet to mention one other striking phenomenon which is among the  chief attractions to observers of total eclipses, and which it has  hitherto not been found possible to see in full daylight. This is the  corona or aureole of light which is suddenly seen to surround the sun in  an eclipse when the moon has completely covered the last remaining  crescent of the sun. A general idea of the appearance of the corona is  given in Fig. 20, and we further present in Plate V. the drawing of the  corona made by Professor Harkness from a comparison of a large number of  photographs obtained at different places in the United States during the  total eclipse of July 29th, 1878. In Fig. 21 we are permitted by the  kindness of Mr. and Mrs. Maunder to reproduce the remarkable photograph  of the corona which they obtained in India during the eclipse of January  22nd, 1898.    [Illustration: Fig. 21.--View of Corona during the Eclipse of Jan. 22nd,  1898 (_Reproduced by kind permission of Mr. and Mrs. Maunder and of the  proprietors of \"Knowledge._\")]    The part of the corona nearest the sun is very bright, though not so  brilliant as the prominences, which (as Professor Young says) blaze  through it like carbuncles. This inner portion is generally of fairly  regular outline, forming a white ring about a tenth part of the solar  diameter in width. The outer parts of the corona are usually very  irregular and very extensive. They are often interrupted by narrow  \"rifts,\" or narrow dark bands, which reach from the limb of the sun  through the entire corona. On the other hand, there are also sometimes  narrow bright streamers, inclined at various angles to the limb of the  sun and not seldom curved. In the eclipses of 1867, 1878, and 1889, all  of which occurred at periods of sun-spot minimum, the corona showed long  and faint streamers nearly in the direction of the sun's equator, and  short but distinct brushes of light near the poles. In the eclipses of  1870, 1882, and 1893, near sun-spot maxima, the corona was more  regularly circular, and chiefly developed over the spot zones. We have  here another proof (if one were necessary) of the intimate connection  between the periodicity of the spots and the development of all other  solar phenomena.    In the spectrum of the corona there is a mysterious line in the green,  as to the origin of which nothing is at present certainly known. It is  best seen during eclipses occurring near the time of sun-spot maximum.  It is presented in the ordinary solar spectrum as a very thin, dark  line, which generally remains undisturbed even when lines of hydrogen  and other substances are twisted and distorted by the violent rush of  disturbed elements. The line is always present among the bright lines of  the chromosphere spectrum. In addition to it the corona shows a few  other bright lines, belonging, no doubt, to the same unknown element  (\"coronium\"), and also a faint continuous spectrum, in which even a few  of the more prominent dark lines of the solar spectrum have been  sometimes detected. This shows that in addition to glowing gas  (represented by the bright lines) the corona also contains a great deal  of matter like dust, or fog, the minute particles of which are capable  of reflecting the sunlight and thereby producing a feeble continuous  spectrum. This matter seems to form the principal constituent of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2743"],[0,"Massacres of the South (1551-1815) (#13)"],[1,"  Fressinet-de-Lozere,        4    \"      \"  Grizac,        15   \"      \"  Castagnols,        11   \"      \"  Vialas,        6    \"      \"  Saint-Julien,        8    \"      \"  Saint-Maurice de Vantalon,        14   \"      \"  Frezal de Vantalon,        7    \"      \"  Saint-Hilaire de Laret,        6    \"      \"  Saint-Andeol de Clergues,        28   \"      \"  Saint-Privat de Vallongues,        10   \"      \"  Saint-Andre de Lancise,        19   \"      \"  Saint-Germain de Calberte,        26   \"      \"  Saint-Etienne de Valfrancesque,        9    \"      \"  parishes of Prunet and Montvaillant,        16   \"      \"  parish of Florac.      ---      202    A second list was promised, and was shortly afterwards published: it  included the parishes of Frugeres, Pompidon, Saint-Martin, Lansuscle,  Saint-Laurent, Treves, Vebron, Ronnes, Barre, Montluzon, Bousquet, La  Barthes, Balme, Saint-Julien d'Aspaon Cassagnas, Sainte-Croix de  Valfrancesque, Cabriac, Moissac, Saint-Roman, Saint Martin de Robaux, La  Melouse, le Collet de Deze, Saint-Michel de Deze, and the villages of  Salieges, Rampon, Ruas, Chavrieres, Tourgueselle, Ginestous, Fressinet,  Fourques, Malbos, Jousanel, Campis, Campredon, Lous-Aubrez, La Croix de  Fer, Le Cap de Coste, Marquayres, Le Cazairal, and Le Poujal.    In all, 466 market towns, hamlets, and villages, with 19,500  inhabitants, were included.    All these preparations made Marechal de Montrevel set out for Aix,  September 26th, 1703, in order that the work might be carried out under  his personal supervision. He was accompanied by MM. de Vergetot and de  Marsilly, colonels of infantry, two battalions of the Royal-Comtois, two  of the Soissonnais infantry, the Languedoc regiment of dragoons, and two  hundred dragoons from the Fimarcon regiment. M. de Julien, on his side,  set out for the Pont-de-Montvert at the same time with two battalions  from Hainault, accompanied by the Marquis of Canillac, colonel of  infantry, who brought two battalions of his own regiment, which was  stationed in Rouergue, with him, and Comte de Payre, who brought  fifty-five companies of militia from Gevaudan, and followed by a number  of mules loaded with crowbars, axes, and other iron instruments  necessary for pulling down houses.    The approach of all these troops following close on the terrible  proclamations we have given above, produced exactly the contrary effect  to that intended. The inhabitants of the proscribed districts were  convinced that the order to gather together in certain places was given  that they might be conveniently massacred together, so that all those  capable of bearing arms went deeper into the mountains, and joined the  forces of Cavalier and Roland, thus reinforcing them to the number of  fifteen hundred men. Also hardly had M. de Julien set his hand to the  work than he received information from M. de Montrevel, who had heard  the news through a letter from Flechier, that while the royal troops  were busy in the mountains the Camisards had come down into the plain,  swarmed over La Camargue, and had been seen in the neighbourhood of  Saint-Gilles. At the same time word was sent him that two ships had been  seen in the offing, from Cette, and that it was more than probable that  they contained troops, that England and Holland were sending to help the  Camisards.    M de Montrevel; leaving the further conduct of the expedition to MM. de  Julien and de Canillac, hastened to Cette with eight hundred men and ten  guns. The ships were still in sight, and were really, as had been  surmised, two vessels which had been detached from the combined fleets  of England and Holland by Admiral Schowel, and were the bearers of  money, arms, and ammunition to the Huguenots. They continued to cruise  about and signal, but as the rebels were forced by the presence of M. de  Montrevel to keep away from the coast, and could therefore make no  answer, they put off at length into the open, and rejoined the fleet. As  M. de Montrevel feared that their retreat might be a feint, he ordered  all the fishermen's huts from Aigues-Morte to Saint-Gilles to be  destroyed, lest they should afford shelter to the Camisards. At the same  time he carried off the inhabitants of the district of Guillan and shut  them up in the chateau of Sommerez, after having demolished their  villages. Lastly, he ordered all those who lived in homesteads, farms,  or hamlets, to quit them and go to some large town, taking with them all  the provisions they were possessed of; and he forbade any workman who  went outside the town to work to take more than one day's provisions  with him.    These measures had the desired effect, but they were terrible in their  results; they deprived the Camisards of shelter indeed, but they ruined  the province. M. de Baville, despite his well-known severity tried  remonstrances, but they were taken in bad part by M. de Montrevel, who  told the intendant to mind his own business, which was confined to civil  matters, and to leave military matters in his, M. de Montrevel's, hands;  whereupon the commandant joined M. de Julien, who was carrying on the  work of destruction with indefatigable vigour.    In spite of all the enthusiasm with which M. de Julien went to work to  accomplish his mission, and being a new convert, it was, of course, very  great. Material hindrances hampered him at every step. Almost all the  doomed houses were built on vaulted foundations, and were therefore  difficult to lay low; the distance of one house from another, too, their  almost inaccessible position, either on the peak of a high mountain or  in the bottom of a rocky valley, or buried in the depths of the forest  which hid then like a veil, made the difficulty still greater; whole  days were often lost by the workmen and militia in searching for the  dwellings they came to destroy.    The immense size of the parishes also caused delay: that of  Saint-Germain de Calberte, for instance, was nine leagues in  circumference, and contained a hundred and eleven hamlets, inhabited by  two hundred and seventy-five families, of which only nine were Catholic;  that of Saint-Etienne de Valfrancesque was of still greater extent, and  its population was a third larger, so that obstacles to the work  multiplied in a remarkable manner. For the first few days the soldiers  and workmen found food in and around the villages, but this was soon at  an end, and as they could hardly expect the peasants to keep up the  supply, and the provisions they had brought with them being also  exhausted, they were soon reduced to biscuit and water; and they were  not even able to make it into a warm mess by heating the water, as they  had no vessels; moreover, when their hard day's work was at an end, they  had but a handful of straw on which to lie. These privations, added to  their hard and laborious life, brought on an endemic fever, which  incapacitated for work many soldiers and labourers, numbers of whom had  to be dismissed. Very soon the unfortunate men, who were almost as much  to be pitied as those whom they were persecuting, waited no longer to be  sent away, but deserted in numbers.    M de Julien soon saw that all his efforts would end in failure if he  could not gain the king's consent to a slight change in the original  plan. He therefore wrote to Versailles, and represented to the king how  long the work would take if the means employed were only iron tools and  the human hand, instead of fire, the only true instrument employed by  Heaven in its vengeance. He quoted in support of his petition the case  of Sodom and Gomorrah--those cities accursed of the Lord. Louis XIV,  impressed by the truth of this comparison, sent him back a messenger  post-haste authorising him to employ the suggested means.    \"At once,\" says Pere Louvreloeil, \"the storm burst, and soon of all the  happy homesteads nothing was left: the hamlets, with their barns and  outhouses, the isolated farmhouses, the single huts and cottages, every  species of building in short, disappeared before the swift advancing  flames as wild flowers, weeds, and roots fall before the ploughshare.\"    This destruction was accompanied by horrible cruelty. For instance,  twenty-five inhabitants of a certain village took refuge in a chateau;  the number consisted of children and very old people, and they were all  that was left of the entire population. Palmerolle, in command of the  miquelets, hearing of this, hastened thither, seized the first eight he  could lay hold of, and shot them on the spot, \"to teach them,\" as he  says in his report, \"not to choose a shelter which was not on the list  of those permitted to them.\"    The Catholics also of St. Florent, Senechas, Rousson, and other  parishes, becoming excited at seeing the flames which enveloped the  houses of their old enemies, joined together, and arming themselves with  everything that could be made to serve as an instrument of death, set  out to hunt the conscripts down; they carried off the flocks of Perolat,  Fontareche, and Pajolas, burned down a dozen houses at the  Collet-de-Deze, and from there went to the village of Brenoux, drunk  with the lust of destruction. There they massacred fifty-two persons,  among them mothers with unborn children; and with these babes, which  they tore from them, impaled on their pikes and halberts, they continued  their march towards the villages of St. Denis and Castagnols.    Very soon these volunteers organised themselves into companies, and  became known under the name of Cadets de la Croix, from a small white  cross which they wore on their coats; so the poor Huguenots had a new  species of enemy to contend with, much more bloodthirsty than the  dragoons and the miquelets; for while these latter simply obeyed orders  from Versailles, Nimes, or Montpellier, the former gratified a personal  hate--a hate which had come down to them from their fathers, and which  they would pass on to their children.
