The times he came to court a spell,        The tender things he said to me,      Make me remember mighty well        My hopes that he'd propose to me.      My face is uglier, and perhaps        Time and the comb have thinned my hair;      And plain and common are the caps,        And dresses that I have to wear--      But memory is ever yet      With all that fellow's flat'ries writ.        I have been out at milking-time        Beneath a dull and rainy sky,      When in the barn 'twas time to feed,        And calves were bawling lustily--      When scattered hay, and sheaves of oats,        And yellow corn-ears, sound and hard,      And all that makes the cattle pass        With wilder richness through the yard--      When all was hateful, then have I,        With friends who had to help me milk,      Talked of his wife most spitefully,        And how he kept her dressed in silk;      And when the cattle, running there,        Threw over me a shower of mud,      That fellow's voice came on the air,        Like the light chewing of the cud--      And resting near some spreckled cow,        The spirit of a woman's spite,      I've poured a low and fervent vow,        To make him, if I had the might,      Live all his life-time just as hard,      And milk his cows in such a yard.        I have been out to pick up wood        When night was stealing from the dawn,      Before the fire was burning good,        Or I had put the kettle on      The little stove--when babes were waking        With a low murmur in the beds,      And melody by fits was breaking        Above their little yellow heads--      And this when I was up perhaps      From a few short and troubled naps--        And when the sun sprang scorchingly      And freely up, and made us stifle,        And fell upon each hill and tree      The bullets from his subtle rifle--        I say a voice has thrilled me then,      Hard by that solemn pile of wood,        Or creeping from the silent glen,      Like something on the unfledged brood,        Hath stricken me, and I have pressed      Close in my arms my load of chips,        And pouring forth the hatefulest      Of words that ever passed my lips,        Have felt my woman's spirit rush      On me, as on that milking night,        And, yielding to the blessed gush      Of my ungovernable spite,        Have risen up, the wed, the old,        Scolding as hard as I could scold.    And in the same vein \"The Annoyer,\" in which is imitated one of the  most delicate pieces of sentiment and fancy which Willis has given us:      THE ANNOYER.              \"Common as light is love,      And its familiar voice wearies not ever.\"--SHELLEY.        Love knoweth every body's house,        And every human haunt,      And comes unbidden, every where,        Like people we don't want.      The turnpike roads and little creeks        Are written with love's words,      And you hear his voice like a thousand bricks        In the lowing of the herds.        He peeps into the teamster's heart,        From his Buena Vista's rim,      And the cracking whips of many men        Can never frighten him.      He'll come to his cart in the weary night,        When he's dreaming of his craft;      And he'll float to his eye in the morning light,        Like a man on a river raft.        He hears the sound of the cooper's adz,        And makes him too his dupe,      For he sighs in his ear from the shaving pile        As he hammers on the hoop.      The little girl, the beardless boy,        The men that walk or stand,      He will get them all in his mighty arms        Like the grasp of your very hand.        The shoemaker bangs above his bench,        And ponders his shining awl,      For love is under the lap-stone hid,        And a spell is on the wall.      It heaves the sole where he drives the pegs,        And speaks in every blow,      'Till the last is dropped from his crafty hand,        And his foot hangs bare below.        He blurs the prints which the shopmen sell,        And intrudes on the hatter's trade,      And profanes the hostler's stable-yard        In the shape of a chamber-maid.      In the darkest night, and the bright daylight,        Knowing that he can win,      In every home of good-looking folks        Will human love come in.    The next is from Poe's \"Annabel Lee:\"      SAMUEL BROWN.        It was many and many a year ago,        In a dwelling down in town,      That a fellow there lived whom you may know        By the name of Samuel Brown;      And this fellow he lived with no other thought        Than to our house to come down.        I was a child and he was a child,        In that dwelling down in town,      But we loved with a love that was more than love,        I and my Samuel Brown--      With a love that the ladies coveted,        Me and Samuel Brown.        And this was the reason that, long ago,        To that dwelling down in town,      A girl came out of her carriage, courting        My beautiful Samuel Brown;      So that her high-bred kinsman came        And bore away Samuel Brown,      And shut him up in a dwelling-house,        In a street quite up in town.        The ladies, not half so happy up there,        Went envying me and Brown;      Yes! that was the reason, (as all men know,        In this dwelling down in town,)      That the girl came out of the carriage by night        Coquetting and getting my Samuel Brown.        But our love is more artful by far than the love        Of those who are older than we--        Of many far wiser than we--      And neither the girls that are living above,        Nor the girls that are down in town,      Can ever discover my soul from the soul        Of the beautiful Samuel Brown.        For the morn never shines without bringing me lines        From my beautiful Samuel Brown;      And the night is never dark, but I sit in the park        With my beautiful Samuel Brown.      And often by day, I walk down in Broadway,      With my darling, my darling, my life, and my stay,        To our dwelling down in town,      To our house in the street down town.    The two poems that have been most parodied in this country are the  \"Woodman spare that tree,\" of General Morris, and Poe's \"Raven.\" There  have been an incredible number of burlesques of the former, and of the  latter we have seen a collection of seventeen, some of which are  scarcely less clever than the original performance.          THE BRITISH HUMORISTS: DESCRIBED    BY MR. THACKERAY.      In the last _International_, we gave sketches of the first and second  of the series of lectures Mr. Thackeray is now delivering in London, a  series which we may regard with more interest because it is to be  repeated in Boston, New-York, and other American cities. The subjects  of the lectures already noticed were SWIFT, CONGREVE, and ADDISON. The  third lecture was upon         SIR RICHARD STEELE.         \"Having,\" says the _Times_, \"to deal with a personage whose       character was any thing but perfection, Mr. Thackeray       started with a good-humored declamation against perfection       in general. A perfect man would be intolerable--he could not       laugh and he could not cry, neither could he hate nor even       love, for love itself implied an unjust preference of one       person over another, which was so far an imperfection. The       interest which a man takes in the progress of his own boy at       school, while he is indifferent about other boys who are       probably better and more clever, his choice that a death       should occur in his neighbor's house rather than in his own,       and various traits of a similar kind, are all so many       manifestations of selfishness, and therefore so many removes       from perfection.         \"After this preface, Mr. Thackeray discoursed upon Steele's       career at school. At the Charter-house he distinguished       himself as a good-natured _mauvais sujet_--idle beyond the       average mark. By his scholastic acquisitions he gave little       satisfaction to his masters, and was flogged more frequently       than any boy in the school. Moreover, he was in debt to all       the vendors of juvenile delicacies in the neighborhood; and,       if any boy came to school with money to lend, Dick Steele       was certain to appear as the person to borrow. These facts,       given with much minuteness, were followed by an assertion on       the part of the lecturer that he had no authority for them       whatever. It was an admitted truth that 'the child is the       father of the man,' and on this principle he felt he had a       right, from his intimate knowledge of Captain Steele, to       deduce what sort of a personage Master Dicky Steele was       likely to be.         \"This bit of mock biography gave the key-note to the entire       lecture. While Mr. Thackeray admitted that Steele was a far       less brilliant man than any who had formed the subjects of       the preceding discourses, and far less entitled to       admiration than Addison, he spoke of him in a tone of warmer       affection than he had displayed when talking of the great       Joseph. He dilated with unction on Steele's many follies and       vices--his strange medley of piety and debauchery, his       inordinate love of dress, his insensibility as to the duty       of meeting pecuniary obligations; he even read an       ill-natured description by John Dennis, remarking that it       was substantially true, but at the same time he constantly       kept before the minds of his hearers the kindliness of       Steele's heart. He did not call upon them to worship him as       a moral being or as a talent, aware that many others much       more deserved such"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36131"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 3, No. 3, June, 1851 (#13)"],[1," unpleasant smell; but, as       I said, we'll sell it very dear, and reserve to ourselves       the monopoly of it.'         \"'My good friend,' one would have said to any one absurd       enough to hold a similar language, 'nobody will envy you the       privilege of selling a weed that no one will care to buy.       You might as well open a shop and write on it: Kicks sold       here; or, Such-a-one sells blows, wholesale and retail. You       will find as many customers as for your poisonous weed.'         \"Well! who would have believed that the first speaker was       right, and that the tobacco speculation would answer       perfectly! The kings of France have written no satires       against snuff, have had no noses cut off, no snuff-boxes       confiscated. Far from it. They have sold tobacco, laid an       impost on noses, and given snuff-boxes to poets with their       portraits on the lid, and diamonds all round. This little       trade has brought them in I don't know how many millions a       year. The potato was far more difficult to popularize, and       has still some adversaries.\"          LORD JEFFREY AND JOANNA BAILLIE.      Joanna Baillie's first volume of poems was severely criticised in the  _Edinburgh Review_ by Jeffrey. In an article upon the deceased poetess  in _Chambers's Journal_, we have an account of her subsequent  relations with the reviewer. She visited Edinburgh in 1808.         \"As she did not refuse to go into company, she could not be       long in that city without encountering Francis Jeffrey, the       foremost man in the bright train of _beaux-esprits_ which       then adorned the society of the Scottish capital. He would       gladly have been presented to her; and if she had permitted       it, there is little doubt that in the eloquent flow of his       delightful and genial conversation, enough of the admiration       he really felt for her poetry must have been expressed, to       have softened her into listening at least with patience to       his suggestions for her improvement. But in vain did the       friendly Mrs. Betty Hamilton (authoress of 'The Cottagers of       Glenburnie') beg for leave to present him to her when they       met in her hospitable drawing-room; and equally in vain were       the efforts made by the good-natured Duchess of Gordon to       bring about an introduction which she knew was desired at       least by one of the parties. It was civilly but coldly       declined by the poetess; and though the dignified reason       assigned was the propriety of leaving the critic more       entirely at liberty in his future strictures than an       _acquaintance_ might perhaps feel himself, there seems       little reason to doubt that soreness and natural resentment       had something to do with the refusal.\"         \"It was in the autumn of 1820 that Miss Baillie paid her       last visit to Scotland, and passed those delightful days       with Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford, the second of which is       so pleasantly given in Mr. Lockhart's life of the bard. Her       friends again perceived a change in her manners. They had       become blander, and much more cordial. She had probably been       now too long admired and reverently looked up to not to       understand her own position, and the encouragement which,       essentially unassuming as she was, would be necessary from       her to reassure the timid and satisfy the proud. She had       magnanimously forgiven and lived down the unjust severity of       her Edinburgh critic, and now no longer refused to be made       personally known to him. He was presented to her by their       mutual friend, the amiable Dr. Morehead. They had much       earnest and interesting talk together, and from that hour to       the end of their lives entertained for each other a mutual       and cordial esteem. After this, Jeffrey seldom visited       London without indulging himself in a friendly pilgrimage to       the shrine of the secluded poetess; and it is pleasing to       find him writing of her in the following cordial way in       later years: \"_London_, April 28, 1840.--I forgot to tell       you that we have been twice out to Hampstead to hunt out       Joanna Baillie, and found her the other day as fresh,       natural, and amiable as ever--and as little like a Tragic       Muse. Since old Mrs. Brougham's death, I do not know so nice       an old woman.\" And again, in January 7, 1842.--\"We went to       Hampstead, and paid a very pleasant visit to Joanna Baillie,       who is marvellous in health and spirits, and youthful       freshness and simplicity of feeling, and not a bit deaf,       blind, or torpid.\"\"          _Authors and Books._      DR. TITUS TOBLER, a Swiss savan, has just published a work entitled  _Golgotha, its Churches and Cloisters_, in the course of which he  undertakes the \"Jerusalem question,\" or the discussion of the probable  localities of the Scripture narrative of the crucifixion. Among the  able German accounts of this treatise, which cannot fail to arrest the  attention of the sacred student, we find the following notice of  Professor Robinson, the first profound and adequate contemporary  authority upon the subject: \"Until the American Robinson, all the  early comparisons and criticisms upon the holy sepulchre were based  much more upon instinct and furious sectarianism, than upon a generous  love of truth and a genuine insight into the matter. Only with  wearisome effort, and not without the consent of the whole Church  power, was Robinson's mighty grasp upon pious tradition repelled. In  the main question the learned Yankee was not altogether wrong. But he  is too rash in battle, too impatient, too reckless, too ambitious, and  his armor was evidently not proof in all parts. Even the knowledge of  the Semitic orient, of its antiquities and customs, seems, if we may  say so without offence to transatlantic vanity, a little threadbare.  But the Robinsonian breach in the wall was not to be entirely  plastered up and its traces concealed. This American has first  recognized the right way of breaking into the citadel of tradition;  others, with more or less skill, have followed his track and widened  the breach. But it was reserved for the inflexible ability of Dr.  Tobler to dig up the very foundations, although he is no centaur, no  giant, and in the pride of strength, does not scorn a childlike  faith.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Among recent German romances we note second and third editions of  JEREMIAS GOTTHELF'S _Sylvester-Dream_, and the _Peasant's Mirror, or a  Life-History_. The author is not much known beyond Germany, but is  there recognized as having the greatest certainty and correctness in  delineation, the most genial principle, and the soundest and freshest  life of any contemporary writer. The Sylvester-Dream is as vague and  fantastic, and of the same electrical effect, as the similar sparkling  flights of Dickens and Jean Paul. _Uriel the Devil_, a satirical  romance, in eight pictures, bears the name of Kaulbach, but whether  the author is related to William Kaulbach, the great painter, we have  no means of ascertaining. This, with the _Memorabilia of a German  House-Servant_ are spoiled by their imitations of Jean Paul, and the  latter is somewhat strongly infected with Hoffman's Phantasies. But  they are both books of more than common talent. Two romances by two  women are most curtly and contemptuously noticed, in a style of  uncourteous condemnation hardly to be paralleled in England or  America, in which countries the chivalry of private respect for the  fair sex always ameliorates condemnation of their writings. \"Of these  two books there is little else to say than that they are moral and  respectable, and extremely well written for women. The former author  has the rare and memorable heroism in a woman to allow her heroine to  reach her thirty-fourth year.\"    Levin Schuneking formerly Grand-Master at the Court of the Elector of  Cologne, has just published _The Peasant Prince_, a romance, called in  Germany his best work.           *       *       *       *       *    KOHL, the traveller or writer of travels, has just published a book  upon the Rhine, which is not of the usual character of his works, as  the author perhaps feared too much the criticising contrast of Victor  Hugo's _Rhine_, to undertake a detailed and sprightly description of  the present life and aspect of the country. The new work is, in fact,  an attempt to portray, according to Ritter's principles, a famous  river region in its geological, historical and statistical relations;  and from this point of view to present it vividly to the mind. The  contents are simple and succinctly arranged, and the book is a signal  success in the popularization of the results of recent geographical  research. It has the same relation to the old river guide books, that  Ritter's philosophical geography has to the old geographies.           *       *       *       *       *    ANASTASIUS GRUN, the famous German poet, has just edited the poetical  remains of Nicolaus Lenau, of whom Auerbach wrote a graceful  reminiscence for the German _Museum_, under the title of _Lenau's last  Summer_. The chief poem of the collection is entitled _Don Juan_,  which, although not fully finished, the German critics highly extol.  Soon after the death of Lenau, in a madhouse, last year, we gave some  account of him in the _International_.           *       *       *       *       *    Of Sir CHARLES LYELL'S Second Journey in America, which Mr. E.  Dieffenbach has rendered into German, the Germans say that its  geniality and _gentlemanliness_, its graceful and striking pictures of  the state of society, politics, and religion, and its popular  treatment of scientific subjects, make it altogether charming.
