But once a year all Pau Ammas must shake off  their hard armour and be soft-to remind them of what the Eldest Magician  could do. And so it isn't fair to kill or hunt Pau Amma's babies just  because old Pau Amma was stupidly rude a very long time ago.    Oh yes! And Pau Amma's babies hate being taken out of their little Pusat  Taseks and brought home in pickle-bottles. That is why they nip you with  their scissors, and it serves you right!           CHINA-GOING P's and O's       Pass Pau Amma's playground close,       And his Pusat Tasek lies       Near the track of most B.I.'s.       U.Y.K. and N.D.L.

But (and this is rather queer)       A.T.L.'s can not come here;       O. and O. and D.O.A.       Must go round another way.       Orient, Anchor, Bibby, Hall,       Never go that way at all.

And if 'Beavers' took their cargoes       To Penang instead of Lagos,       Or a fat Shaw-Savill bore       Passengers to Singapore,       Or a White Star were to try a       Little trip to Sourabaya,       Or a B.S.A. went on       Past Natal to Cheribon,       Then great Mr. Lloyds would come       With a wire and drag them home!         You'll know what my riddle means       When you've eaten mangosteens.    Or if you can't wait till then, ask them to let you have the outside  page of the Times; turn over to page 2 where it is marked 'Shipping'  on the top left hand; then take the Atlas (and that is the finest  picture-book in the world) and see how the names of the places that  the steamers go to fit into the names of the places on the map. Any  steamer-kiddy ought to be able to do that; but if you can't read, ask  some one to show it you.          THE CAT THAT WALKED BY HIMSELF    HEAR and attend and listen; for this befell and behappened and became  and was, O my Best Beloved, when the Tame animals were wild. The Dog was  wild, and the Horse was wild, and the Cow was wild, and the Sheep was  wild, and the Pig was wild--as wild as wild could be--and they walked in  the Wet Wild Woods by their wild lones. But the wildest of all the wild  animals was the Cat. He walked by himself, and all places were alike to  him.    Of course the Man was wild too. He was dreadfully wild. He didn't even  begin to be tame till he met the Woman, and she told him that she  did not like living in his wild ways. She picked out a nice dry Cave,  instead of a heap of wet leaves, to lie down in; and she strewed clean  sand on the floor; and she lit a nice fire of wood at the back of  the Cave; and she hung a dried wild-horse skin, tail-down, across the  opening of the Cave; and she said, 'Wipe you feet, dear, when you come  in, and now we'll keep house.'    That night, Best Beloved, they ate wild sheep roasted on the hot stones,  and flavoured with wild garlic and wild pepper; and wild duck stuffed  with wild rice and wild fenugreek and wild coriander; and marrow-bones  of wild oxen; and wild cherries, and wild grenadillas. Then the Man  went to sleep in front of the fire ever so happy; but the Woman sat up,  combing her hair. She took the bone of the shoulder of mutton--the big  fat blade-bone--and she looked at the wonderful marks on it, and she  threw more wood on the fire, and she made a Magic. She made the First  Singing Magic in the world.    Out in the Wet Wild Woods all the wild animals gathered together where  they could see the light of the fire a long way off, and they wondered  what it meant.    Then Wild Horse stamped with his wild foot and said, 'O my Friends and O  my Enemies, why have the Man and the Woman made that great light in that  great Cave, and what harm will it do us?'    Wild Dog lifted up his wild nose and smelled the smell of roast mutton,  and said, 'I will go up and see and look, and say; for I think it is  good. Cat, come with me.'    'Nenni!' said the Cat. 'I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all  places are alike to me. I will not come.'    'Then we can never be friends again,' said Wild Dog, and he trotted off  to the Cave. But when he had gone a little way the Cat said to himself,  'All places are alike to me. Why should I not go too and see and look  and come away at my own liking.' So he slipped after Wild Dog softly,  very softly, and hid himself where he could hear everything.    When Wild Dog reached the mouth of the Cave he lifted up the dried  horse-skin with his nose and sniffed the beautiful smell of the roast  mutton, and the Woman, looking at the blade-bone, heard him, and  laughed, and said, 'Here comes the first. Wild Thing out of the Wild  Woods, what do you want?'    Wild Dog said, 'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, what is this that  smells so good in the Wild Woods?'    Then the Woman picked up a roasted mutton-bone and threw it to Wild Dog,  and said, 'Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, taste and try.' Wild Dog  gnawed the bone, and it was more delicious than anything he had ever  tasted, and he said, 'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, give me another.'    The Woman said, 'Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, help my Man to hunt  through the day and guard this Cave at night, and I will give you as  many roast bones as you need.'    'Ah!' said the Cat, listening. 'This is a very wise Woman, but she is  not so wise as I am.'    Wild Dog crawled into the Cave and laid his head on the Woman's lap, and  said, 'O my Friend and Wife of my Friend, I will help Your Man to hunt  through the day, and at night I will guard your Cave.'    'Ah!' said the Cat, listening. 'That is a very foolish Dog.' And he went  back through the Wet Wild Woods waving his wild tail, and walking by his  wild lone. But he never told anybody.    When the Man waked up he said, 'What is Wild Dog doing here?' And the  Woman said, 'His name is not Wild Dog any more, but the First Friend,  because he will be our friend for always and always and always. Take him  with you when you go hunting.'    Next night the Woman cut great green armfuls of fresh grass from the  water-meadows, and dried it before the fire, so that it smelt like  new-mown hay, and she sat at the mouth of the Cave and plaited a halter  out of horse-hide, and she looked at the shoulder of mutton-bone--at the  big broad blade-bone--and she made a Magic. She made the Second Singing  Magic in the world.    Out in the Wild Woods all the wild animals wondered what had happened to  Wild Dog, and at last Wild Horse stamped with his foot and said, 'I will  go and see and say why Wild Dog has not returned. Cat, come with me.'    'Nenni!' said the Cat. 'I am the Cat who walks by himself, and all  places are alike to me. I will not come.' But all the same he followed  Wild Horse softly, very softly, and hid himself where he could hear  everything.    When the Woman heard Wild Horse tripping and stumbling on his long mane,  she laughed and said, 'Here comes the second. Wild Thing out of the Wild  Woods what do you want?'    Wild Horse said, 'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, where is Wild Dog?'    The Woman laughed, and picked up the blade-bone and looked at it, and  said, 'Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, you did not come here for Wild  Dog, but for the sake of this good grass.'    And Wild Horse, tripping and stumbling on his long mane, said, 'That is  true; give it me to eat.'    The Woman said, 'Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, bend your wild head  and wear what I give you, and you shall eat the wonderful grass three  times a day.'    'Ah,' said the Cat, listening, 'this is a clever Woman, but she is not  so clever as I am.' Wild Horse bent his wild head, and the Woman slipped  the plaited hide halter over it, and Wild Horse breathed on the Woman's  feet and said, 'O my Mistress, and Wife of my Master, I will be your  servant for the sake of the wonderful grass.'    'Ah,' said the Cat, listening, 'that is a very foolish Horse.' And he  went back through the Wet Wild Woods, waving his wild tail and walking  by his wild lone. But he never told anybody.    When the Man and the Dog came back from hunting, the Man said, 'What is  Wild Horse doing here?' And the Woman said, 'His name is not Wild Horse  any more, but the First Servant, because he will carry us from place  to place for always and always and always. Ride on his back when you go  hunting.    Next day, holding her wild head high that her wild horns should not  catch in the wild trees, Wild Cow came up to the Cave, and the Cat  followed, and hid himself just the same as before; and everything  happened just the same as before; and the Cat said the same things as  before, and when Wild Cow had promised to give her milk to the Woman  every day in exchange for the wonderful grass, the Cat went back through  the Wet Wild Woods waving his wild tail and walking by his wild lone,  just the same as before. But he never told anybody. And when the Man  and the Horse and the Dog came home from hunting and asked the same  questions same as before, the Woman said, 'Her name is not Wild Cow any  more, but the Giver of Good Food. She will give us the warm white milk  for always and always and always, and I will take care of her while you  and the First Friend and the First Servant go hunting.    Next day the Cat waited to see if any other Wild thing would go up to  the Cave, but no one moved in the Wet Wild Woods, so the Cat walked  there by himself; and he saw the Woman milking the Cow, and he saw the  light of the fire in the Cave, and he smelt the smell of the warm white  milk.    Cat said, 'O my Enemy and Wife of my Enemy, where did Wild Cow go?'    The Woman laughed and said, 'Wild Thing out of the Wild Woods, go back  to the Woods again, for I have braided up my hair, and I have put away  the magic blade-bone,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27827"],[0,"The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana (#13)"],[1,"softened, and after that is done he should  proceed to put his lingam into her.    The acts to be done by the man are:       Moving forward.     Friction or churning.     Piercing.     Rubbing.     Pressing.     Giving a blow.     The blow of a boar.     The blow of a bull.     The sporting of a sparrow.    (1). When the organs are brought together properly and directly it is  called \"moving the organ forward.\"    (2). When the lingam is held with the hand, and turned all round in the  yoni, it is called \"churning.\"    (3). When the yoni is lowered, and the upper part of it is struck with  the lingam, it is called \"piercing.\"    (4). When the same thing is done on the lower part of the yoni, it is  called \"rubbing.\"    (5). When the yoni is pressed by the lingam for a long time, it is  called \"pressing.\"    (6). When the lingam is removed to some distance from the yoni, and then  forcibly strikes it, it is called \"giving a blow.\"    (7). When only one part of the yoni is rubbed with the lingam, it is  called the \"blow of a boar.\"    (8). When both sides of the yoni are rubbed in this way, it is called  the \"blow of a bull.\"    (9). When the lingam is in the yoni, and moved up and down frequently,  and without being taken out, it is called the \"sporting of a sparrow.\"  This takes place at the end of congress.    When a woman acts the part of a man, she has the following things to do  in addition to the nine given above, viz.       The pair of tongs.     The top.     The swing.    (1). When the woman holds the lingam in her yoni, draws it in, presses  it, and keeps it thus in her for a long time, it is called the \"pair of  tongs.\"    (2). When, while engaged in congress, she turns round like a wheel, it  is called the \"top.\" This is learnt by practice only.    (3). When, on such an occasion, the man lifts up the middle part of his  body, and the woman turns round her middle part, it is called the  \"swing.\"    When the woman is tired, she should place her forehead on that of her  lover, and should thus take rest without disturbing the union of the  organs, and when the woman has rested herself the man should turn round  and begin the congress again.    There are also some verses on the subject as follows:    \"Though a woman is reserved, and keeps her feelings concealed, yet when  she gets on the top of a man, she then shows all her love and desire. A  man should gather from the actions of the woman of what disposition she  is, and in what way she likes to be enjoyed. A woman during her monthly  courses, a woman who has been lately confined, and a fat woman should  not be made to act the part of a man.\"          CHAPTER XI.    OF THE AUPARISHTAKA[39] OR MOUTH CONGRESS.      There are two kinds of eunuchs, those that are disguised as males, and  those that are disguised as females. Eunuchs disguised as females  imitate their dress, speech, gestures, tenderness, timidity, simplicity,  softness and bashfulness. The acts that are done on the jaghana or  middle parts of women, are done in the mouths of these eunuchs, and this  is called Auparishtaka. These eunuchs derive their imaginable pleasure,  and their livelihood from this kind of congress, and they lead the life  of courtezans. So much concerning eunuchs disguised as females.    Eunuchs disguised as males keep their desires secret, and when they wish  to do anything they lead the life of shampooers. Under the pretence of  shampooing, an eunuch of this kind embraces and draws towards himself  the thighs of the man whom he is shampooing, and after this he touches  the joints of his thighs and his jaghana, or central portions of his  body. Then, if he finds the lingam of the man erect, he presses it with  his hands, and chaffs him for getting into that state. If after this,  and after knowing his intention, the man does not tell the eunuch to  proceed, then the latter does it of his own accord and begins the  congress. If however he is ordered by the man to do it, then he disputes  with him, and only consents at last with difficulty.    The following eight things are then done by the eunuch one after the  other, viz.       The nominal congress.     Biting the sides.     Pressing outside.     Pressing inside.     Kissing.     Rubbing.     Sucking a mangoe fruit.     Swallowing up.    At the end of each of these the eunuch expresses his wish to stop, but  when one of them is finished, the man desires him to do another, and  after that is done, then the one that follows it, and so on.    (1). When, holding the man's lingam with his hand, and placing it  between his lips, the eunuch moves about his mouth, it is called the  \"nominal congress.\"    (2). When, covering the end of the lingam with his fingers collected  together like the bud of a plant or flower, the eunuch presses the sides  of it with his lips, using his teeth also, it is called \"biting the  sides.\"    (3). When, being desired to proceed, the eunuch presses the end of the  lingam with his lips closed together, and kisses it as if he were  drawing it out, it is called the \"outside pressing.\"    (4). When, being asked to go on, he put the lingam further into his  mouth, and presses it with his lips and then takes it out, it is called  the \"inside pressing.\"    (5). When, holding the lingam in his hand, the eunuch kisses it as if he  were kissing the lower lip, it is called \"kissing.\"    (6). When, after kissing it, he touches it with his tongue everywhere,  and passes the tongue over the end of it, it is called \"rubbing.\"    (7). When, in the same way, he puts the half of it into his mouth, and  forcibly kisses and sucks it, this is called \"sucking a mangoe fruit.\"    (8). And lastly, when, with the consent of the man, the eunuch puts the  whole lingam into his mouth, and presses it to the very end, as if he  were going to swallow it up, it is called \"swallowing up.\"    Striking, scratching, and other things may also be done during this kind  of congress.    The Auparishtaka is practised only by unchaste and wanton women, female  attendants and serving maids, _i.e._, those who are not married to  anybody, but who live by shampooing.    The Acharyas (_i.e._, ancient and venerable authors) are of opinion that  this Auparishtaka is the work of a dog and not of a man, because it is a  low practice, and opposed to the orders of the Holy Writ, and because  the man himself suffers by bringing his lingam into contact with the  mouths of eunuchs and women. But Vatsyayana says that the orders of the  Holy Writ do not affect those who resort to courtezans, and the law  prohibits the practice of the Auparishtaka with married women only. As  regards the injury to the male, that can be easily remedied.    The people of Eastern India do not resort to women who practise the  Auparishtaka.    The people of Ahichhatra resort to such women, but do nothing with them,  so far as the mouth is concerned.    The people of Saketa do with these women every kind of mouth congress,  while the people of Nagara do not practise this, but do every other  thing.    The people of the Shurasena country, on the southern bank of the Jumna,  do everything without any hesitation, for they say that women being  naturally unclean, no one can be certain about their character, their  purity, their conduct, their practices, their confidences, or their  speech. They are not however on this account to be abandoned, because  religious law, on the authority of which they are reckoned pure, lays  down that the udder of a cow is clean at the time of milking, though the  mouth of a cow, and also the mouth of her calf, are considered unclean  by the Hindoos. Again a dog is clean when he seizes a deer in hunting,  though food touched by a dog is otherwise considered very unclean. A  bird is clean when it causes a fruit to fall from a tree by pecking at  it, though things eaten by crows and other birds are considered unclean.  And the mouth of a woman is clean for kissing and such like things at  the time of sexual intercourse. Vatsyayana moreover thinks that in all  these things connected with love, everybody should act according to the  custom of his country, and his own inclination.    There are also the following verses on the subject.    \"The male servants of some men carry on the mouth congress with their  masters. It is also practised by some citizens, who know each other  well, among themselves. Some women of the harem, when they are amorous,  do the acts of the mouth on the yonis of one another, and some men do  the same thing with women. The way of doing this (_i.e._, of kissing the  yoni) should be known from kissing the mouth. When a man and woman lie  down in an inverted order, _i.e._, with the head of the one towards the  feet of the other and carry on this congress, it is called the \"congress  of a crow.\"    For the sake of such things courtezans abandon men possessed of good  qualities, liberal and clever, and become attached to low persons, such  as slaves and elephant drivers. The Auparishtaka, or mouth congress,  should never be done by a learned Brahman, by a minister that carries on  the business of a state, or by a man of good reputation, because though  the practice is allowed by the Shastras, there is no reason why it  should be carried on, and need only be practised in particular cases. As  for instance, the taste, and the strength, and the digestive qualities  of the flesh of dogs are mentioned in works on medicine, but it does not  therefore follow that it should be eaten by the wise. In the same way  there are some men, some places and some times, with respect to which  these practices can be made use of. A man should therefore pay regard to  the place, to the time, and to the practice which is to be carried out,  as also as to whether it is agreeable to his nature and to himself, and  then he may or may not practise these things according to circumstances.  But after all, these things being done secretly, and the mind of the"]]]
