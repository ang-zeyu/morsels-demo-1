This species of the secondary forest usually was associated with       piles of brush or heavy growth of fern. I never saw it higher than       three feet above the ground.    _=Stachyris nigricollis=_ (Temminck): Black-necked Tree  Babbler.--_Specimens_, 4: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], June 15, 1963,  ADG 144.

Although I worked in the same area and at the same time of year as       did Garcia, I did not see this species.    _=Stachyris leucotis obscurata=_ Mayr: White-necked Tree  Babbler.--_Specimen_, 1: Oil Palm Research Station: [Male], September 5,  1963, ADG 274.         Garcia's specimen was taken in primary forest. Smythies (1960:418)       states that most records come from submontane localities, except       for those from Bettotan; the specimen is from an altitude of 40       feet, near Bettotan.    _=Stachyris maculata maculata=_ (Temminck): Red-rumped Tree  Babbler.--_Specimens_, 12: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] largest ova  2 mm., brood patch, July 10, 1962, MCT 2613; [Male], 25.8 gm., August 5,  1962, MCT 2731; [Male], 28.0 gm., August 5, 1962, MCT 2732. 12 mi.

Oil Palm Research Station: [Female],  August 14, 1963, ADG 235; [Female], August 15, 1963, ADG 237.         This babbler was common in small groups at Quoin Hill. Whitehead       (1893:227) states that the species \"frequents the true forest near       the ground.\" I observed these babblers only in sub-canopy trees, at       least 30 feet above the ground. Smythies (1960:419) stated that he       had never seen this species in the forest undergrowth.    _=Stachyris erythroptera bicolor=_ (Blyth): Red-winged Tree  Babbler.--_Specimens_, 11: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 2 x 1  mm., 13.4 gm., July 24, 1962, MCT 2654; [Female] imm., 13.0 gm., August  28, 1962, MCT 2832; [Female], 12.5 gm., August 28, 1962, MCT 2833;  [Male], December 2, 1962, MCT 3432; [Female], December 2, 1962, MCT  3433. 12 mi.

Ulu  Balung Cocoa Estate: [Male], July 10, 1963, ADG 184; [Male], July 17,  1963, ADG 206.         This species was seen most often in primary forest undergrowth, but       occasionally as high as 10 feet up in small trees. I saw it also in       and around brush piles in secondary forest. The one specimen from       5.5 mi. SW Tenom was taken in the moss forest. MCT 2833 was in       heavy molt on the wings, head, and body.    _=Stachyris rufifrons sarawacensis=_ Chasen: Hume's Tree  Babbler.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] testis 4 x 3  mm., November 28, 1962, MCT 3358.         There was no comparative material in the U. S. National Museum       where I studied the specimen but it fits Chasen's original       description of _S. r. sarawacensis_. H. G. Deignan (_in_ Peters _et       al._, 1964:303) considered this subspecies doubtfully distinct from       _S. r. poliogaster_.         The specimen was taken at a height of one and one-half feet in a       mist net set along a path. The bird was caught when it attempted to       cross the path from a patch of heavy undergrowth to a patch on the       other side. Mary Norman observed them at Kalabakan (Smythies,       1963:281) in saplings. They should probably be considered birds of       the understory.    _=Alcippe brunneicauda=_ (Salvadori): Brown Quaker  Babbler.--_Specimens_, 22: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] imm., 14.4  gm., August 20, 1962, MCT 2781; [Female], 14.9 gm., September 6, 1962,  MCT 2877; [Female], September 25, 1962, MCT 2957; [Female], November 28,  1962, MCT 3361; [Female], November 28, 1962, MCT 3362; [Male], November  28, 1962, MCT 3376; [Male], November 28, 1962, MCT 3378; [Male] testis 5  x 3 mm., December 1, 1962, MCT 3410; [Male], December 2, 1962, MCT 3435;  [Male], November 30, 1962, MCT 3440; [Male], November 30, 1962, MCT  3441. 12 mi.

Birds of this species were common in primary forest at the three       localities listed under \"specimens.\" They travel in small, loose       flocks, calling as they move through the forest. Periodic calling,       interspersed with periods of silence, was characteristic of the       species; vocalization of this sort may function in maintaining the       unity of the well spaced flock.    _=Yuhina castaniceps everetti=_ (Sharpe): Chestnut-headed  Yuhina.--_Specimens_, 14: 5.5 mi. SW Tenom: [Female], December 19, 1962,  MCT 3468; [Male] testis 6 x 3 mm., December 23, 1962, MCT 3512; [Male]  testis 7 x 3 mm., December 23, 1962, MCT 3513; [Male] testis 6 x 3 mm.,  December 24, 1962, MCT 3520; [Female], December 24, 1962, MCT 3521;  [Male] testis 5 x 3 mm., December 24, 1962, MCT 3523; [Male] testis 6 x  3 mm., December 24, 1962, MCT 3524; [Female], December 24, 1962, MCT  3525; [Female], December 24, 1962, MCT 3526; [Male] testis 6 x 3 mm.,  December 24, 1962, MCT 3527; [Male] testis 6 x 3 mm., December 28, 1962,  MCT 3542; [Male] testis 6 x 3 mm., December 28, 1962, MCT 3543.         I saw several flocks of this species in moss forest at a point 5.5       miles southwest of Tenom. Some were observed going into cavities in       the moss, where they apparently caught insects. They sometimes did       this simultaneously, in several places on the same tree.    _=Yuhina zantholeuca brunnescens=_ (Sharpe): White-bellied  Yuhina.--_Specimens_, 4: 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Female], October 12, 1962,  MCT 3010; sex?, November 1, 1962, MCT 3193; sex?, December 22, 1962, MCT  3500; [Male] testis 7 x 4 mm., December 23, 1962, MCT 3519.         One flock of about five of these yuhinas was seen in primary forest       at Kalabakan. Another small group was observed in the moss forest       near Tenom.    _=Tephrodornis gularis frenatus=_ Buettikofer: Hook-billed  Graybird.--_Specimens_, 3: Cocoa Research Station: [Male], September 25,  1962, wing molt, MCT 2946; [Female], September 25, 1962, wing molt, MCT  2947; [Female], September 25, 1962, MCT 2948.         I observed this species twice in six months on the east coast. The       three collected at the research station in the cocoa were in a       family group. On November 9, 1962, I saw three birds feeding at the       edge of the primary forest.    _=Coracina striata sumatrensis=_ (S. Mueller): Barred  Graybird.--_Specimens_, 2: Tiger Estate: [Female], December 30, 1962;  [Male], December 30, 1962.    _=Coracina fimbriata schierbrandi=_ (Pelzeln): Lesser  Graybird.--_Specimens_, 6: Cocoa Research Station: [Male] imm., 25.7  gm., July 22, 1962, MCT 2637; sex?, 29.5 gm., July 28, 1962, MCT 2676;  [Male], 28.4 gm., August 5, 1962, MCT 2729; [Female], 30.0 gm.,  September 13, 1962, MCT 2917. 12 mi. N Kalabakan: [Female], October 25,  1962, MCT 3147. Tiger Estate: [Male], November 25, 1962, MCT 3317.         This species was common at the Cocoa Research Station, most common       in the cocoa, and an occasional bird was observed in the primary       forest.         The adult male (MCT 3317) from Tiger Estate was darker than any in       the series of _C. f. schierbrandi_ in The American Museum of       Natural History, and closely approached a series _C. f. culminata_       from Malaya in the same museum.    _=Hemipus hirundinaceus=_ (Temminck): Black-winged Flycatcher  Shrike.--_Specimen_, 1: Cocoa Research Station: [Female], 10.2 gm., July  21, 1962, MCT 2632.         The specimen was taken in the cocoa where it was sitting on a dead       limb, occasionally darting out after insects, and provides the only       record from this locality. At the collecting site 12 miles north of       Kalabakan, however, it was seen several times feeding in small       flocks in a clearing near a trail.    _=Hemipus picatus intermedius=_ Salvadori: Bar-winged Flycatcher  Shrike.--_Specimens_, 6: Cocoa Research Station: [Female] imm., August  27, 1962, MCT 2815; [Male] imm., August 27, 1962, MCT 2816; [Female],  August 27, 1962, MCT 2817; [Female], 9.8 gm., September 12, 1962, MCT  2906; [Female], 10.2 gm., September 12, 1962, MCT 2907; [Male] imm., 8.7  gm., September 12, 1962, MCT 2908.         Smythies (1960:362) lists this species as a montane resident.       However, the elevation of the Cocoa Research Station is only 750       feet, which is clearly submontane (Smythies, 1960:693). I saw the       birds in a flock of three or four, feeding in shade trees in the       cocoa fields. They acted like typical flycatchers, sitting on twigs       and darting out after insects. On September 12, a flock of 10 was       seen in the same area. Whitehead (1893:208) described the habits of       the species as being like those of _Tephrodornis gularis_ and not       at all like those of a flycatcher.    _=Lalage "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3307"],[0,"The Pagan Tribes of Borneo (#13)"],[1," and the most important  form of currency. Besides these largest gongs, smaller ones of various  shapes and sizes are kept and used on festive occasions (Pl. 45). All  these gongs are obtained through traders from Bruni, China, and Java.    Beside the gongs a Kayan house generally contains, as the  common property of the whole household, several long narrow drums  (Fig. 10). Each is a hollow cylinder of wood, constricted about its  middle, open at one end, and closed at the other with a sheet of  deer-skin. This is stretched by means of slips of rattan attached to  its edges, and carried back to a stout rattan ring woven about the  constricted middle of the drum; the skin is tightened by inserting  wedges under this ring.    In most houses two or three small brass swivel guns may be seen  in the gallery, and a small stock of powder for their service is  usually kept by the chief. They are sometimes discharged to salute a  distinguished visitor, and formerly played some small part in repelling  attacks. The domestic animals of the Kayans are fowls, goats, pigs,  and dogs. The latter live in the house, the others run free beneath  and around the house.    The material possessions of the other peoples differ little from those  of the Kayans. Almost every Sea Dayak possesses, and keeps stored at  the back of his private chamber, one or more large vases. These were  formerly imported from China, but are now made by the Chinese of the  towns in Borneo. The commonest of the highly prized jars are of plain  brown brightly glazed earthenware, standing about three feet in height  on a flat bottom (Pl. 48); each is ornamented with a Chinese dragon  moulded in relief (BENAGA), or some scroll designs which, though very  varied, go by the name of RUSA (=deer) and NINGKA. A Dayak will give  from 200 to 400 dollars for such a jar. Rarer and still more highly  prized is a jar similar to these, but wider, very highly glazed, and  bare of all ornament save some obscure markings. Eight perforated  \"ears\" project just below the lip, and serve for the attachment of  a wooden or cloth cover. This jar occurs in two varieties, a dark  green and a very dark brown, which are known respectively as GUSI  and BERGIAU, the latter being the more valuable. Other smaller and  less valued jars are the PANTAR and the ALAS. The jars of the kinds  mentioned above are valued largely on account of their age; probably  all of them were imported from China and Siam, some of them no doubt  centuries ago. Besides these old jars there are now to be found in  most of the Sea Dayak houses many jars of modern Chinese manufacture,  some of which are very skilful imitations of the old types; and  though the Dayak is a connoisseur in these matters, and can usually  distinguish the new from the old, he purchases willingly the cheap  modern imitations of the old, because they are readily mistaken by  the casual observer for the more valuable varieties (Pl. 47).    A few large vases of Chinese porcelain, usually covered with elaborate  designs in colour, are to be found in most of the houses of the other  peoples (Pl. 47).        CHAPTER 5    The Social System    The Kayans constitute a well-defined and homogeneous tribe or  people. Although their villages are scattered over a wide area,  the Kayan people everywhere speak the same language and follow  the same customs, have the same traditions, beliefs, rites, and  ceremonies. Such small differences as they present from place to  place are hardly greater than those obtaining between the villagers  of adjoining English counties. Although communication between the  widely separated branches of the people is very slight and infrequent,  yet all are bound together by a common sentiment for the tribal name,  reputation, tradition, and customs. The chiefs keep in mind and hand  down from generation to generation the history of the migrations of  the principal branches of the tribe, the names and genealogies of the  principal chiefs, and important incidents affecting any one branch. At  least fifteen sub-tribes of Kayans, each bearing a distinctive name,  are recognised.[38] The word UMA, which appears in the names of each  group, means village or settlement, and it seems probable that these  fifteen sub-tribes represent fifteen original Kayan villages which  at some remote period, before the tribe became so widely scattered,  may have contained the whole Kayan population. At the present time  the people of each sub-tribe occupy several villages, which in most  cases, but not in all, are within the basin of one river.    In spite of the community of tribal sentiment, which leads Kayans  always to take the part of Kayans, and prevents the outbreak of  any serious quarrels between Kayan villages, there exist no formal  bonds between the various sub-tribes and villages. Each village is  absolutely independent of all others, save in so far as custom and  caution prescribe that, before undertaking any important affair (such  as a removal of the village or a warlike expedition), the chief will  seek the advice, and, if necessary, the co-operation of the chiefs  of neighbouring Kayan villages. The people of neighbouring villages,  especially the families of the chiefs, are also bound together by  many ties of kinship; for intermarriage is frequent.    As was said above, a Kayan village almost invariably consists of  several long houses. Each house is ruled by a chief; but one such  chief is recognised as the head-chief of the village.    The minor and purely domestic affairs of each house are settled  by the house-chief, but all important matters of general interest  are brought before the village-chief. In the former category fall  disputes as to ownership of domestic animals and plants, questions  of compensation for injury or loss of borrowed boats, nets, or other  articles, of marriage and divorce, and minor personal injuries, moral  or physical. The matters to be settled by the head-chief sitting in  council with the subordinate chiefs are those affecting the whole  village, questions of war and peace and of removal, disputes between  houses, trials for murder or serious personal injuries.    The degree of authority of the chiefs and the nature and degree of  the penalties imposed by them are prescribed in a general way by  custom, though as regards the former much depends upon the personal  qualities of each chief, and as regards the latter much is left to his  discretion. The punishments imposed are generally fines, so many TAWAKS  (gongs), PARANGS (swords) or spears, or other articles of personal  property. On the whole the chief plays the part of an arbitrator and  mediator, awarding compensation to the injured party, rather than that  of a judge. In the case of offences against the whole house, a fine  is imposed; and the articles of the required value are placed under  the charge of the chief, who holds them on behalf of the community,  and uses them in the making of payments or presents in return for  services rendered to the whole community.    The chief also is responsible for the proper observation of the omens  and for the regulation of MALAN (tabu) affecting the whole house; and,  as we shall see, he takes the leading part in social ceremonies and in  most of the religious rites collectively performed by the village. He  is regarded by other chiefs as responsible for the behaviour of his  people, and above all, in war he is responsible for both strategy  and tactics and the general conduct of operations.    For the maintenance of his authority and the enforcement of his  commands the chief relies upon the force of public opinion, which,  so long as he is capable and just, will always support him, and will  bring severe moral pressure to bear upon any member of the household  who hesitates to submit.    In return for his labours on behalf of the household or village the  Kayan chief gains little or nothing in the shape of material reward. He  may receive a little voluntary assistance in the cultivation of his  field; in travelling by boat he is accorded the place of honour and  ease in the middle of the boat, and he is not expected to help in  its propulsion. His principal rewards are the social precedence and  deference accorded him and the satisfaction found in the exercise  of authority.    If the people of a house or village are gravely dissatisfied with  the conduct of their chief, they will retire to their PADI-fields,  building temporary houses there. If many take this course, a new  long house will be built and a new chief elected to rule over it,  while the old chief remains in the old house with a reduced following,  sometimes consisting only of his near relatives.    The office of chief is rather elective than hereditary, but the  operation of the elective principle is affected by a strong bias in  favour of the most capable son of the late chief; so in practice a  chief is generally succeeded by one of his sons. An elderly chief will  sometimes voluntarily abdicate in favour of a son. If a chief dies,  leaving no son of mature age, some elderly man of good standing and  capacity will be elected to the chieftainship, generally by agreement  arrived at by many informal discussions during the weeks following  the death. If thereafter a son of the old chief showed himself a  capable man as he grew up, he would be held to have a strong claim on  the chieftainship at the next vacancy. If the new chief at his death  left also a mature and capable son, there might be two claimants, each  supported by a strong party; the issue of such a state of affairs would  probably be the division of the house or village, by the departure of  one claimant with his party to build a new village. In such a case  the seceding party would carry away with them their share of the  timbers of the old house, together with all their personal property.
