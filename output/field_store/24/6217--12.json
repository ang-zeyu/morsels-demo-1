Increment in plastral length for  the first season of growth was expressed as a percentage of original  plastral length because of variability of growth in the season of  hatching; growth increments in the season following hatching are,  therefore, not so great as indicated in Figure 11.      Growth of Juveniles    Areas of new laminal growth were discernible on laboratory hatchlings  soon after they ate regularly. Hatchlings that refused to eat or that  were experimentally starved did not grow. The first zone of epidermis  was separated from the areola by an indistinct growth-ring (resembling  a minor growth-ring) in most hatchlings, but in a few specimens the  new epidermis appeared to be a continuation of the areola. Major  growth-rings never formed before the onset of the first hibernation.    Growth in the season of hatching seems to depend on early hatching and  early emergence from the nest. Under favorable conditions hatchlings  would be able to feed and grow eight weeks or more before  hibernation. Hatchlings that emerge in late autumn or that remain in  the nest until spring are probably unable to find enough food to  sustain growth.    Sixty-four (42 per cent) of the 154 specimens examined showed  measurable growth in the season of hatching. The amount of increment  was determined in 36 specimens having a first growth-ring and an  areola that could be measured accurately. The average increment of  plastral length was 17.5 per cent (extremes, 1.8-66.0 per cent) of the  original plastral length. Ten individuals showed an increment of more  than 20 per cent; the majority of these individuals (8) were hatched  in the years 1947-50, inclusive.       [Illustration: FIG. 9. See legend for Fig. 10.]       [Illustration: FIG. 10. The relationship of size to age in         _T. o. ornata_, based on studies of growth-rings in 115         specimens of known sex (67 females and 48 males) from eastern         Kansas. Size is expressed as plastral length at the end of each         growing season (excluding the year of hatching) through the         twelfth and thirteenth years (for males and females,         respectively) of life. Vertical and horizontal lines represent,         respectively, the range and mean. Open and solid rectangles         represent one standard deviation and two standard errors of the         mean, respectively. Age is expressed in years.]    Some hatchlings that grow rapidly before the first winter are as large  as one- or two-year-old turtles, or even larger, by the following  summer. Individuals that grew rapidly in the season of hatching tended  also to grow more rapidly than usual in subsequent seasons; 80 per  cent of the individuals that increased in plastral length by 20 per  cent or more in the season of hatching, grew faster than average in  the two seasons following hatching. Early hatching and precocious  development presumably confer an advantage on the individual, since  turtles that grow rapidly are able better to compete with smaller  individuals of the same age. Theoretically, turtles growing more  rapidly than usual in the first two or three years of life, even if  they grew subsequently at an average rate, would attain adult size and  sexual maturity one or more years before other turtles of the same  age. A few turtles (chiefly males) attain adult size (and presumably  become sexually mature) by the end of the fifth full season of growth  (Figs. 9 and 10). These individuals, reaching adult size some three to  four years sooner than the average age, were precocious also in the  earlier stages of postnatal development.    Young box turtles reared in the laboratory grew more slowly than  turtles of comparable ages under natural conditions; this was  especially evident in hatchlings and one-year-old specimens. Slower  growth of captives was caused probably by the unnatural environment of  the laboratory. Captive juveniles showed a steady increase in weight  (average, .52 grams per ten days) as they grew whereas captive  hatchlings tended to lose weight whether they grew or not.      Growth in Later Life    After the first year growth is variable and size is of little value as  an indicator of age. Although in the turtles sampled variation in size  was great in those of the same age, average size was successively  greater in each year up to the twelfth and thirteenth years (for males  and females, respectively), after which the samples were too small to  consider mathematically.    Increments in plastral length averaged 68.1 per cent in the year after  hatching, 28.6 per cent in the second year and 18.1 per cent in the  third year. From the fourth to the fourteenth year the growth-rate  slowed gradually from 13.3 to about three per cent (Fig. 11). These  averages are based on all the specimens examined (with no distinction  as to sex); they give a general, over-all picture of growth rate but  do not reflect the changes that occur in growth rate at puberty (as  shown in Figs. 9 and 10).    Rate of growth and, ultimately, size are influenced by the attainment  of sexual maturity. Adult females grow larger than adult males. Males,  nevertheless, grow faster than females and become sexually mature when  smaller and younger. Examination of gonads showed 17 per cent of the  males to be mature at plastral lengths of 90 to 99 millimeters, 76 per  cent at 100 to 109 millimeters, and 100 per cent at 110 millimeters,  whereas the corresponding percentages of mature females in the same  size groups were: zero per cent, 47 per cent, and 66 per cent. Of the  females, 97 per cent were mature at 120 to 129 millimeters and all  were mature at 130 millimeters (Fig. 13). Because growth slows  perceptibly at sexual maturity, it is possible, by examination of  growth-rings, to estimate the age of puberty in mature specimens.    [Illustration: FIG. 11. Average increment in plastral length  (expressed as a percentage of plastral length at the end of the  previous season of growth) in the season of hatching (H) and in each  of the following 14 years of life, based on 1073 growth-rings. The  number of specimens examined for each year of growth is shown in  parentheses. Records for males and females are combined.]    Attainment of sexual maturity, in the population studied, was more  closely correlated with size than with age. For example, nearly all  males were mature when the plastron was 100 to 110 millimeters long,  regardless of the age at which this size was attained. The smallest  mature male had a plastral length of 99 millimeters; according to the  data presented in Figures 9 and 10, therefore, a few males reach  sexual maturity in the fourth year, and increasingly larger portions  of the population become mature in the fifth, sixth, and seventh  years. The majority become mature in the eighth and ninth years.  Likewise, females (smallest mature specimen, 107 mm.) may be sexually  mature at the end of the sixth year but most of them mature in the  tenth and eleventh years.    Annual Period of Growth    In growing individuals, narrow zones of new epidermis form on the  laminae in spring. Nearly all the growing individuals collected in May  of 1954 and 1955 had zones of new epidermis on the shell but those  collected in April did not. Activity in the first week or two after  spring emergence is sporadic and regular feeding may not begin until  early May. Once begun, growth is more or less continuous as long as  environmental conditions permit foraging. The formation of minor  growth-rings and adjacent growth-zones in autumn, provides evidence  that growth commonly continues up to the time of hibernation. The  number of growing days per year varies, of course, with the  favorableness of environmental conditions. The length of time (162  days) given by Fitch (1956b:438) as the average annual period of  activity for _T. ornata_ is a good estimate of the number of growing  days per season.      Environmental Factors Influencing Growth    Zones of epidermis formed in some years are wider or narrower than the  zones bordering them (Pl. 22). Zones notably narrower or wider than  the average, formed in certain years, constituted distinct landmarks  in the growth-histories of nearly all specimens; for example, turtles  of all ages grew faster than average in 1954 and zones of epidermis  formed in this year were always wider than those formed in 1953 and  1955.    An index to the relative success of growth in each calendar year was  derived. Records of growth for all specimens in each age group were  averaged; the figure obtained was used to represent \"normal\" or  average growth rate in each year of life (Fig. 12). The over-all  averages for the various age groups were then compared with records of  growth attained by individuals of corresponding age in each calendar  year, growth in a particular year being expressed as a percentage of  the over-all average. The percentages of average growth for all ages  in each calendar year were then averaged; the mean expressed the  departure from normal rate of growth for all turtles growing in a  particular calendar year. For example, the over-all average increment  in plastral length in the fifth year of life was 12.1 per cent, the  increment in the sixth year was 10 per cent, and so on (Fig. 11). In  1953, turtles in their fifth and sixth years increased in plastral  length by 11.4 and 9.1 per cent, or grew at 94.2 and 91.0 per cent of  the normal rate, respectively. The percentages of normal growth rate  for these age groups averaged with percentages of the other age groups  in 1953 revealed that turtles grew at approximately 86 per cent of the  normal rate in 1953.    Growth rates were computed for the twelve-year period, 1943-1954,  because of the concentration of records in these years. Scattered  records also were available for many of the years from 1901-1942.  Records for individuals in the season of hatching and the first full  season of growth were "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37595"],[0,"Ecological Studies of the Timber Wolf in Northeastern Minnesota (#13)"],[1,"----:-------------------:------------------:-----------------            #   %      %        #   %      %       #   %      %               male  female        male  female       male  female    Fawns     4    0    100      18   50     50     22   41     59  Adults   41   71     29      64   44     56    105   56     44  ----------------------------------------------------------------      Wolf-killed deer in our sample, with an average age of 4.7 years, were  significantly older (99 percent level) than hunter-killed deer, with an  average age of 2.6 years. For example, deer 5 years of age and older  made up 48 percent of the wolf-kills but only 10 percent of the  hunter-kills (table 4). The oldest hunter-killed deer in our sample was  9-1/2 years old, but the oldest wolf-killed deer was 14-1/2 (fig. 7).    [Illustration: _Figure 7.--Comparison between the age structures of  deer killed by wolves, deer killed by hunters, and a theoretical  population from the same general area of northeastern Minnesota_.]    Because of a possible bias against fawns in the method of collecting  data from wolf-kills (to be discussed later), the age structure of the  sample of wolf-kills excluding fawns was tested against that of the  sample of hunter-kills excluding fawns. The result once again was a  highly significant difference between these two age structures (table  1).    As an additional test of the degree to which the age structure of the  wolf-killed deer might differ from that of the actual population, we  compared our wolf-kill age structure with the age structure of a  hypothetical deer population. This was considered advisable just in  case the hunter-kill data were poorly representative of the age  structure of the actual deer herd. Several hypothetical age structures  were constructed and compared according to advice from Downing.[27]  In all cases, the comparisons produced the same basic results as the  tests with the hunter-killed sample. An example of one comparison is  given in figure 7.    A further result obtained by aging the wolf-killed deer pertained to  the young individuals killed. The deciduous first incisors of fawns and  the deciduous premolars of yearlings are usually replaced with  permanent teeth by December (Severinghaus 1949). Of 24 wolf-killed  fawns examined, however, three (13 percent) taken during January,  February, and March had not yet replaced their deciduous first  incisors. Of the 13 yearlings found during this same period, nine (70  percent) had failed to replace their deciduous premolars, and two (15  percent) had just replaced them (one deer killed in February and one  killed in March).

Statistical comparison  showed that the incidence of each condition was significantly higher in  the sample from wolf-killed deer (table 8).    Jaw necrosis found in our specimens was similar to that described by  Murie (1944) for Dall sheep and Mech (1966a) for moose. Generally  animals with this condition are old, and ours were no exception.
