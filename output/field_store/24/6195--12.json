Her shoulders are bent;  her hair gray, but she still does a large amount of housework. She likes  to sit on the tumbledown front porch on summer afternoons, plying her  knitting needles and stretching her aged legs in the warm sunlight.    \"'Twas a long time ago, honey,\" she observed when talk of slavery days  was brought up, \"but I 'members as ef 'twas yestidy. My ol' mistus was  de Widder Day. She owned a plantation clos't to Lafayette an' she was  mighty good to us niggers.    \"Ol' Mistus boughten me when I was jus' a little tyke, so I don't  'member 'bout my pappy an' mammy.    \"Honey, I 'members dat us little chilluns didn't go to de fiel's twel us  was big 'nuff to keep up a row. De oberseer, Marse Joe Harris, made us  work, but he was good to us. Ol' Mistus, she wouldn't let us wuk whin it  was rainin' an' cold.\"    Asked about pleasures of the old plantation life, she chuckled and  recalled:    \"I kin heah de banjers yit. Law me, us had a good time in dem days. Us  danced most eb'ry Sattidy night an' us made de rafters shake wid us  foots. Lots o' times Ole Missus would come to de dances an' look on. An'  whin er brash nigger boy cut a cute bunch uv steps, de menfolks would  give 'im a dime or so.    \"Honey, us went t' de church on a Sundays. I allus did lak singin' and I  loved de ol' songs lak, 'Ol' Ship of Zion,' an' 'Happy Land.' Ol' Mistus  useter take all de little scamps dat was too little for church an' read  de Book to dem under de big oak tree in de front yahd.\"    \"Aunt Hattie,\" she was asked, \"do you remember anything about the War  between the States?\"    \"You mean de Yankees, honey?\"    \"Yes, the Yankees.\"    Her coal black face clouded.    \"Dey skeered us nearly to death,\" she began. \"Dey drap right outen de  sky. Ol' Mistus keep hearin' dey was comin', but dey didn't nebber show  up. Den, all ter once, dey was swarmin' all ober de place wid deir blue  coats a-shinin' an' deir horses a'rarin'.    \"Us chilluns run en hid in de fence corners en' behin' quilts dat was  hangin' on de line. An' honey, dem Yankees rid deir horses rat onto Ol'  Mistus flower beds. Dey hunted de silver, too, but us done hid dat.    \"I 'members dey was mad. Dey sot de house a-fire an' tuk all de vittals  dey could fin'.

She finds her  great happiness in \"de promise\" and the moments when she can sit in the  shade and dip her mind back into memory.          Wadley \"Shorty\" Clemons          *Interview with Wadley \"Shorty\" Clemons*      --_G.L. Clark_    He was bent over the lawn, carefully trimming the border into a neat  line. A small black figure in overalls, clean but worn blue chambray  shirt, the misshapen remains of shoes and a nondescript hat, from under  which protruded thin white sideburns.    \"Good morning, Uncle,\" I said, \"Mr. Lee was telling me about you. He  said you lived back in slavery times. Is that right?\"    \"Yes suh, I sho' did. I'll be 92 years old de second of August, and I  was a slave for 20 year. I had a good ole massa and mistis, de bes' dere  was. Ole massa was a great big man, an' he wa'n't scared of nothin' dey  was. He wouldn't go nowhere without me. He always took me wid him. My  grandma was a cook and my ma was a house girl.    \"We lived in Pine Hill, a summer resort in Jefferson County, Georgia,  across the river from Louisville. From home we could look over and see  de people walkin' about in Louisville.    [Illustration: _Wadley (Shorty) Clemons, [TR: Village Springs?],  Alabama_]    \"I remembers de day de Yankees come to Louisville. We could see them  goin' about from one house to anudder, settin' fire. Den dey come on to  de river and sot fire to de bridge. Dey wouldn't use our bridge. Dey  built dese here pontoon bridges and dey could build dem before you could  look away and look back. Den dey come across de river to Pine Hill.    \"Ole massa had his hosses an' mules hid down in de swamp but my uncle  Tom went and got 'em an' brung 'em to de Yankees at de big gate. He  didn't had to do it. He was jes' mean. He hadn't been much good to massa  since de war commenced; lay off in de swamp mos' of de time. Arter he  brung massa's hosses an' mules to de Yankees he went wid dem into  massa's bedroom and dey jes' throwed massa and mistis close all outa' de  closet and wardrobe and he give em' mistis gold yearings and bracelets  and dey took de yearings and put dem on de hosses' years and put de  bracelets on de hosses' ankles.    \"Ole massa was sittin' on de long porch smokin' one of dese Meerschaum  pipes wid a stem way so long and dat pipe was white as snow. He had a  big can of tobacco on de table in front of him. In dem days people made  dey own tobacco and I wisht I had some of it now.    \"Massa had 'bout thutty fattening hogs and de Yankees jes' went in de  pen and cut dem hogs in two. He had jes' lots of turkeys and guineas an'  de Yankees shot dem down. He had thutty hives of bees in one long row  an' one Yankee run up to de firs' hive an jump in it head first, and de  bees stung him till he died. De udders pull him out and took him to de  well and poured water over him but he stayed dead so dey just dug a hole  down by the side of the road and bury him in it. Yessir, dat's de trufe!    \"Dey stayed dere all night and camped out and cooked massa's good smoked  meat and burnt down de barns and done all de devilment dey could. I  couldn't see no use in dere doin' what dey did, but dat's what dey done.    \"Massa had 71 slaves when dey was made free. De next county wasn't fit  for much farming and atter we was freed my Uncle Andy went dere an'  bought a place. De land sold for 50 cents de acre atter de timber was  cut off. Uncle Andy had a brudder Sam and Sam had a steer. Dey plowed  wid de steer.    \"Uncle Andy worked at de sawmill in daytime an' at night he cut two  cords of wood before he go to bed. He make two bales of cotton de first  year and de next year he make four. Den he tuk up preachin'. He was a  Methodist preacher.    \"Den ole massa die and ole mistis lose all her land. Uncle Andy was  right good fixed so he took keer of her a year or more 'fore she died.  Den when she died, he went to pay all de expenses of de funeral but de  white folks won't let him kase dey say he done his share already.    \"My massa's name was William Clemons and dey name me Wadley for ole man  Wadley, de president of de Center Road.    \"Dem days is gone a long time an' I still heah, but dey was good times  den. I had plenty to eat, plenty close to wear and when I gets sick, ole  massa come to give me some medicine and I don't need no doctor.    \"People worship God in dem days and not bother wid church houses so  much. Ev'ry Sunday ole massa get out by de back do' and teach us Sunday  school. Den we cut tree limbs and make brush arbors for preaching. In de  summer atter crops been laid by, us all, black and white, go to camp  meetin' and stay a week. De white preacher preach on one side and de  nigger on de udder.

I remember de slavery days. How could I forgits?\"    Slowly Uncle Will spoke these words as he made his way up a few rickety  steps with the aid of an old broomstick to his cabin door. \"We can jes'  set in de swing effen you wants to hear a little 'bout dem ole days,  kaze I can sho tell it.\"    \"Well, first, Uncle Will, what's your full name and where are you from?\"    \"My name am William Colbert and I'se fum Georgia. I was bawn in 1844 on  my massa's plantation in Fort Valley. My massa's name was Jim Hodison.  At one time he had 165 of us niggers.\"    Uncle Will, a gaunt, black figure with two weeks growth of gray hair  upon his face, spoke in a soft, quaking voice scarcely audible ten feet  away. His eyes had a far-off, sad expression of one who had known  suffering. They were set deep back in bony caverns.    \"Well, Uncle Will, tell me something about the slave days. Was your  master good to you?\"    [Illustration: _William Colbert, [TR: Birmingham], Alabama_]    \"Nawsuh, he warn't good to none of us niggers.

In de kitchen I see  none, and how I see money any where else, your honor? Nigger never had  none! I ain't got any money now, long time since I see any money.    \"What did us eat?
