And there is one case of a boy being killed by it.    Most Americans know somewhat of its terrors, but few of them realize the  harmlessness of the Skunk when let alone. In remote places I find men  who still think that this creature goes about shooting as wildly and  wantonly as any drunken cowboy.      THE CRUELTY OF STEEL TRAPS    A few days ago while walking with a friend in the woods we came on a  Skunk. My companion shouted to the dog and captured him to save him from  a possible disaster, then called to me to keep back and let the Skunk  run away. But the fearless one in sable and ermine did not run, and I  did not keep back, but I walked up very gently. The Skunk stood his  ground and raised his tail high over his back, the sign of fight. I  talked to him, still drawing nearer; then, when only ten feet away, was  surprised to see that one of his feet was in a trap and terribly  mangled.    [Illustration]    I stooped down, saying many pleasant things about my friendliness, etc.  The Skunk's tail slowly lowered and I came closer up. Still, I did not  care to handle the wild and tormented thing on such short acquaintance,  so I got a small barrel and quietly placed it over him, then removed the  trap and brought him home, where he is now living in peace and comfort.    I mention this to show how gentle and judicious a creature the Skunk is  when gently and judiciously approached. It is a sad commentary on our  modes of dealing with wild life when I add that as afterward appeared  this Skunk had been struggling in the tortures of that trap for three  days and three nights.      FRIENDLINESS OF THE SKUNK    These remarks are preliminary to an account of my adventures with a  family of Skunks in the Park. During the summer I spent in the little  shanty still to be seen, opposite Yancey's, I lost no opportunity of  making animal investigations. One of my methods was to sweep the dust on  the trail and about the cabin quite smooth at night so that any creature  passing should leave me his tracks and I should be sure that they were  recent.    [Illustration]    One morning on going out I found the fresh tracks of a Skunk. Next night  these were seen again, in fact, there were two sets of them. A day or so  later the cook at the nearby log hotel announced that a couple of  Skunks came every evening to feed at the garbage bucket outside the  kitchen door. That night I was watching for them. About dusk one came,  walking along sedately with his tail at half mast. The house dog and the  house cat both were at the door as the Skunk arrived. They glanced at  the newcomer; then the cat discreetly went indoors and the dog rumbled  in his chest, but discreetly he walked away, very stiffly, and looked at  the distant landscape, with his hair on his back still bristling. The  Skunk waddled up to the garbage pail, climbed in, though I was but ten  feet away, and began his evening meal.    [Illustration]    Another came later. Their tails were spread and at each sharp noise rose  a little higher, but no one offered them harm, and they went their way  when they were filled.    After this it was a regular thing to go out and see the Skunks feed when  evening came.      PHOTOGRAPHING SKUNKS AT SHORT RANGE    I was anxious to get a picture or two, but was prevented by the poor  light; in fact, it was but half light, and in those days we had no  brilliant flash powders. So there was but one thing to do, that was trap  my intended sitters.    Next night I was ready for them with an ordinary box trap, and even  before the appointed time we saw a fine study in black and white come  marching around the cow stable with banner-tail aloft, and across the  grass toward the kitchen. The box trap was all ready and we--two women  including my wife, and half a dozen men of the mountaineer type--were  watching. The cat and the dog moved sullenly aside. The Skunk, with the  calm confidence of one accustomed to respect, sniffed his way to the box  trap with its tempting odorous bait. A Mink or a Marten, not to say a  Fox, would have investigated a little before entering. The Skunk  indulged in no such waste of time. What had he to fear--he the little  lord of all things with the power of smell? He went in like one going  home, seized the bait, and down went the door. The uninitiated onlookers  expected an explosion from the Skunk, but I knew quite well he never  wasted a shot, and did not hesitate to approach and make all safe. Now I  wanted to move the box with its captive to my photographic studio, but  could not carry it alone, so I asked the mountaineers to come and help.  Had I asked them to join me in killing a man, shooting up the town, or  otherwise taking their lives in their hands, I would doubtless have had  half a dozen cheerful volunteers; but to carry a box in which was a wild  Skunk--\"not for a hundred dollars,\" and the warriors melted into the  background.    Then I said to my wife, \"Haven't _you_ got nerve enough to help with  this box? I'll guarantee that nothing will happen.\" So she came and we  took the box to my prepared enclosure, where next day I photographed him  to my heart's content. More than once as I worked around at a distance  of six or eight feet, the Skunk's tail flew up, but I kept perfectly  still then; talked softly, apologizing and explaining: \"Now don't shoot  at me. We are to be good friends. I wouldn't hurt you for anything. Now  do drop that fighting flag, if you please, and be good.\"    [Illustration]    Gradually the tail went down and the captive looked at me in mere  curiosity as I got my pictures.    I let him go by simply removing the wire netting of the fence, whereupon  he waddled off under the cabin that I called \"home.\"      WE SHARE THE SHANTY WITH THE SKUNKS    [Illustration]    The next night as I lay in my bunk I heard a sniffing and scratching on  the cabin floor. On looking over the edge of the bed I came face to face  with my friend the Skunk. Our noses were but a foot apart and just  behind him was another; I suppose his mate. I said: \"Hello! Here you  are again. I'm glad to see you. Who's your friend?\" He did not tell me,  neither did he seem offended. I suppose it was his mate. That was the  beginning of his residence under the floor of my cabin. My wife and I  got very well acquainted with him and his wife before the summer was  over. For though we had the cabin by day, the Skunks had it by night. We  always left them some scraps, and regularly at dusk they came up to get  them. They cleaned up our garbage, so helped to rid us of flies and  mice. We were careful to avoid hurting or scaring our nightly visitors,  so the summer passed without offense. We formed only the kindest  feelings toward each other, and we left them in possession of the cabin,  where, so far as I know, they are living yet, if you wish to call.      THE SKUNK AND THE UNWISE BOBCAT    [Illustration]    As already noted, I swept the dust smooth around our shanty each night  to make a sort of visitors' book. Then each morning I could go out and  by study of the tracks get an exact idea of who had called. Of course  there were many blank nights; on others the happenings were trifling,  but some were full of interest. In this way I learned of the Coyote's  visits to the garbage pail and of the Skunk establishment under the  house, and other interesting facts as in the diagram. I have always used  this method of study in my mountain trips, and recall a most interesting  record that rewarded my patience some twenty years ago when I lived in  New Mexico.    [Illustration: XXII. Track record of Bobcat's adventure with a Skunk]    During the night I had been aroused by a frightful smell of Skunk,  followed by strange muffled sounds that died away. So forth I went at  sunrise and found the odour of Skunk no dream but a stern reality. Then  a consultation of my dust album revealed an inscription which after a  little condensing and clearing up appeared much as in Plate XXII. At A a  Skunk had come on the scene, at B he was wandering about when a hungry  Wild Cat or Bobcat Lynx appeared, C. Noting the promise of something to  kill for food, he came on at D. The Skunk observing the intruder said,  \"You better let me alone.\" And not wishing to make trouble moved off  toward E. But the Bobcat, evidently young and inexperienced, gave chase.  At F the Skunk wheeled about, remarking, \"Well, if you will have it,  here goes!\" At G the Lynx was hit. The tremendous bound from G to H  shows the effect. At J he bumped into a stone, showing probably that he  was blinded, after which he went bouncing and bounding away. The Skunk  merely said, \"I told you so!\" then calmly resumed the even tenor of his  way. At K he found the remains of a chicken, on which he feasted, then  went quietly home to bed.    This is my reading of the tracks in the dust. The evidence was so clear  that I have sketched here from imagination the succession of events  which it seemed to narrate.    [Illustration: XXIII. The six chapters of the Bobcat's adventure. (a)  The Bobcat appears on the scene; (b) \"Ha,\" he says, \"A meal for me.\"  \"Beware,\" says the Skunk; (c) \"No!

Seton_]      MY PET SKUNKS    It would not be doing justice to the Skunk if I did not add a word about  certain of the kind that I have at home.    For many years I have kept at least one pet Skunk. Just now I have about  sixty. I keep them close to the house and would let them run loose  indoors but for the possibility of some fool dog or cat coming around,  and provoking the exemplary little brutes into a perfectly justifiable  endeavour to defend themselves as nature taught them. But for this I  should have no fear. Not only do I handle them myself, but I have  induced many of my"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27901"],[0,"Jewish Literature and Other Essays (#13)"],[1,"literature,  especially in the form of fables, was made to serve moral ends. A Jew,  Berachya ben Natronai, was the precursor of Marie de France, the famous  French fabulist, and La Fontaine and Lessing are indebted to him for  some of their material. As in the case of Aristotelian philosophy and of  Greek and Arabic medical science, Jews assumed the role of mediators in  the transmission of fables. Indian fables reached their Arabic guise  either directly or by way of Persian and Greek; thence they passed into  Hebrew and Latin translations, and through these last forms became the  property of the European languages. For instance, the Hebrew translation  of the old Sanskrit fox fables was the one of greatest service in  literary evolution. The translator of the fox fables is credited also  with the translation of the romance of \"The Seven Wise Masters,\" under  the title _Mishle Sandabar_. These two works gave the impetus to a great  series in Occidental literature, and it seems altogether probable that  Europe's first acquaintance with them dates from their Hebrew  translation.    In Arabic poetry, too, many a Jew deservedly attained to celebrity.  Abraham ibn Sahl won such renown that the Arabs, notorious for  parsimony, gave ten gold pieces for one of his songs. Other poets have  come down to us by name, and Joseph Ezobi, whom Reuchlin calls _Judaeorum  poeta dulcissimus_, went so far as to extol Arabic beyond Hebrew poetry.  He was the first to pronounce the dictum famous in Buffon's repetition:  \"The style is the man himself.\" Provence, the land of song, produced  Kalonymos ben Kalonymos (Maestro Calo), known to his brethren in faith  not only as a poet, but also as a scholar, whose Hebrew translations  from the Arabic are of most important works on philosophy, medicine, and  mathematics. As Anatoli had worked under Emperor Frederick II., so  Kalonymos was attached to Robert of Naples, patron of Jewish scholars.  At the same time with the Spanish and the German minstrel, there  flourished in Rome Immanuel ben Solomon, the friend of Dante, upon whose  death he wrote an Italian sonnet, and whose _Divina Commedia_ inspired a  part of his poetical works also describing a visit to paradise and hell.    With the assiduous cultivation of romantic poetry, which was gradually  usurping the place of moral romances and novels, grew the importance of  Oriental legends and traditions, so pregnant with literary suggestions.  This is attested by the use made of the Hebrew translation of Indian  fables mentioned before, and of the famous collection of tales, the  _Disciplina clericalis_ by the baptized Jew Petrus Alphonsus. The Jews  naturally introduced many of their own peculiar traditions, and thus can  be explained the presence of tales from the Talmud and the Midrash in  our modern fairy tale books.    It is necessary to note again that the Jews in turn submitted to the  influence of foreign literatures. Immanuel Romi, for example, at his  best, is an exponent of Provencal versification and scholastic  philosophy, while his lapses testify to the self-complacency and levity  characteristic of the times. Yehuda Romano, one of his contemporaries,  is said to have been teacher to the king of Naples. He was the first Jew  to attain to a critical appreciation of the vagaries of scholasticism,  but his claim to mention rests upon his translations from the Latin.    As Jews assisted at the birth of Arabic, French, and German, so they  have a share in the beginnings of Spanish, literature. Jews must be  credited with the first \"Chronicle of the Cid,\" with the romance, _Comte  Lyonnais, Palanus_, with the first collection of tales, the first chess  poems, and the first troubadour songs. Again, the oldest collection of  the last into a _cancionera_ was made by the Jew Juan Alfonso de Baena.    Even distant Persia has proofs to show of Jewish ability and energy in  those days. One Jew composed an epic on a biblical subject in the  Persian language, another translated the Psalms into the vernacular.    The most prominent Jewish exponent of philosophy in this age of  strenuous interest in metaphysical speculations and contests was Levi  ben Gerson (Leon di Bannolas), theologian, scientist, physician, and  astronomer. One of his ancestors, Gerson ben Solomon, had written a work  typical of the state of the natural sciences in his day. Levi ben  Gerson's chief work became famous not among Jews alone. It was referred  to in words of praise by Pico della Mirandola, Reuchlin, Kepler, and  other Christian thinkers. He was the inventor of an astronomical  instrument, a description of which was translated into Latin at the  express command of Pope Clement VI., and carefully studied by Kepler.  Besides, Levi ben Gerson was the author of an arithmetical work. In  those days, in fact up to the seventeenth century, there was but a faint  dividing line between astronomy and mathematics, as between medicine and  natural history. John of Seville was a notable mathematician, the  compiler of a practical arithmetic, the first to make mention of decimal  fractions, which possibly may have been his invention, and in the Zohar,  the text-book of mediaeval Jewish mysticism, which appeared centuries  before Copernicus's time, the cause of the succession of day and night  is stated to be the earth's revolution on its axis.    In this great translation period scarcely a single branch of human  science escaped the mental avidity of Jews. They found worthy of  translation such essays as \"Rules for the Shoeing and Care of Horses in  Royal Stables\" and \"The Art of Carving and Serving at Princely Boards.\"  Translations of works on scholasticism now took rank beside those from  Greek and Arabic philosophers, and to translations from the Arabic into  Hebrew were added translations from and into Latin, or even into the  vernacular idiom wherever literary forms had developed. The bold  assertion can be made good that not a single prominent work of ancient  science was left untranslated. On the other hand it is hard to speculate  what would have been the fate of these treasures of antiquity without  Jewish intermediation. Doubtless an important factor in the work was the  encouragement given Jewish scholars by enlightened rulers, such as  Emperor Frederick II., Charles and Robert of Anjou, Jayme I. of Aragon,  and Alfonso X. of Castile, and by popes, and private patrons of  learning. Mention has been made of Jewish contributions to the work of  the medical schools of Montpellier and Salerno. Under Jayme I. Christian  and Jewish savants of Barcelona worked together harmoniously to promote  the cause of civilization and culture in their native land. The first to  use the Catalan dialect for literary purposes was the Jew Yehuda ben  Astruc, and under Alfonso (X.) the Wise, Jews again attained to  prominence in the king's favorite science of astronomy. The Alfonsine  Tables were chiefly the work of Isaac ibn Sid, a Toledo _chazan_  (precentor). In general, the results reached by Jewish scholarship at  Alfonso's court were of the utmost importance, having been largely  instrumental in establishing in the age of Tycho de Brahe and Kepler the  fundamental principles of astronomy and a correct view of the orbits of  the heavenly bodies. Equal suggestiveness characterizes Jewish research  in mathematics, a science to which, rising above the level of  intermediaries and translators, Jews made original contributions of  importance, the first being Isaac Israeli's \"The Foundation of the  Universe.\" Basing his observations on Maimuni's and Abraham ben Chiya's  statement of the sphericity of the earth, Israeli showed that the  heavenly bodies do not seem to occupy the place in which they would  appear to an observer at the centre of the earth, and that the two  positions differ by a certain angle, since known as parallax in the  terminology of science. To Judah Hakohen, a scholar in correspondence  with Alfonso the Wise, is ascribed the arrangement of the stars in  forty-eight constellations, and to another Jew, Esthori Hafarchi, we owe  the first topographical description of Palestine, whither he emigrated  when the Jews were expelled from France by Philip the Fair.    Meanwhile the condition of the Jews, viewed from without and from  within, had become most pitiable. The Kabbala lured into her charmed  circle the strongest Jewish minds. Scientific aspirations seemed  completely extinguished. Even the study of the Talmud was abandoning  simple, undistorted methods of interpretation, and espousing the  hairsplitting dialectics of the northern French school. Synagogue poetry  was languishing, and general culture found no votaries among Jews.  Occasionally only the religious disputations between Jews and Christians  induced some few to court acquaintance with secular branches of  learning. In the fourteenth century Chasdai Crecas was the only  philosopher with an original system, which in its arguments on free  will and the nature of God anticipated the views of one greater than  himself, who, however, had a different purpose in view. That later and  greater philosopher, to whom the world is indebted for the evangel of  modern life, was likewise a Jew, a descendant of Spanish-Jewish  fugitives. His name is Baruch Spinoza.    However sad their fortunes, the literature of the Jews never entirely  eschewed the consideration of subjects of general interest. This  receives curious confirmation from the re-introduction of Solomon  Gabirol's peculiar views into Jewish religious philosophy, by way of  Christian scholasticism, as formulated especially by Thomas Aquinas, the  _Doctor angelicus_.    The Renaissance and the humanistic movement also reveal Jewish  influences at work. The spirit of liberty abroad in the earth passed  through the halls of Israel, clearing the path thenceforth to be trodden  by men. Again the learned were compelled to engage the good offices of  the Jews,"]]]
