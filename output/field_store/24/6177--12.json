S Llano, 3500 ft., 4; Mescal      Wash, 4200 ft., 5 (3PC).      =Neotoma fuscipes macrotis= Thomas    Dusky-footed Woodrat    This subspecies was widely distributed along the coastal slope of the  mountains from the coastal sage belt, at roughly 1600 feet, up to 6500  feet at the lower edge of the yellow pine forest and was most common in  the chaparral association.    In the coastal sage belt these woodrats are restricted to wash areas  where large chaparral plants such as lemonadeberry and laurel sumac are  used as nesting sites. In San Antonio Wash the occasional large juniper  trees almost invariably harbor the nests of _fuscipes_. The general  absence of suitable nesting sites in the sage belt probably limits the  spread of _fuscipes_ in this area.    In the upper part of the chaparral belt in talus these woodrats live  beneath the angular boulders and build no visible houses. Several areas  of talus occupied by woodrats were examined carefully and no sign of  houses was noted.    Two juveniles were found in the stomach of a rattlesnake (_Crotalus  viridis helleri_) killed in May, 1948, at the mouth of Evey Canyon.  Remains of woodrats were found in feces of the coyote and gray fox.    Lactating females of this species were taken on March 16, and October 2,  1951.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 4, distributed as follows: San      Bernardino County: Icehouse Canyon, 5500 ft., 2. Los Angeles      County: San Antonio Canyon, 2800 ft., 2.      =Neotoma fuscipes simplex= True    Dusky-footed Woodrat    These rats were recorded from the yellow pine forests on Blue Ridge, at  8100 feet, down to the lower edge of the juniper belt, at 3800 feet.  Their presence there as elsewhere was determined by the occurrence of  adequate cover. On Blue Ridge they were taken in and near patches of  snowbrush, currant, and choke cherry, and one was taken beneath a pile  of logs where no nest was in evidence.    The thickets of choke cherry in hollows on Blue Ridge were favored  house-building sites of woodrats. Among the tangle of branches large  nests were built, and in September, 1951, the remains of choke cherry  fruit and gnawings on the limbs of these plants indicated that woodrats  were active throughout these extensive patches of brush.    In the pinyon-juniper association most of the large plants were used  as nesting sites, but scrub oak, seemed to be especially preferred.  Because it often grew in a twisted irregular form with the foliage  nearly reaching the ground, the oak offered good shelter for the woodrat  nests. In an acre of scrub oak and mountain mahogany brush one-half mile  north of Jackson Lake, at 6100 feet, thirteen occupied woodrat nests  were found. In the juniper belt, houses were of more irregular  occurrence, and were always beneath juniper trees, usually beneath the  largest and most widely spreading individuals.    Those specimens from Blue Ridge, on the crest of the San Gabriels, are  intergrades between the coastal race _macrotis_ and _simplex_ of the  desert slope. Although specimens vary widely in color, comparison with  series of these two subspecies in the California Museum of Vertebrate  Zoology indicates that all specimens from the desert slope of the San  Gabriels are referable to the race _simplex_. Two specimens of this  species from the granite talus above the base of Icehouse Canyon at 5500  feet on the Pacific slope, grade strongly toward _simplex_. Hooper  (1938:231) mentions that specimens of this species taken along the San  Gabriel and San Bernardino ranges may be intermediate between _simplex_  and _macrotis_.    At the head of Grandview Canyon, tracks indicated that a coyote had  foraged for about one half mile along the edge of a tract of dense oak  and pinyon growth. It seemed as if the animal had been foraging for  woodrats. A gray fox trapped near Graham Canyon, in the juniper belt,  had in its stomach the remains of a freshly killed adult woodrat. The  remains of an adult woodrat were found in the stomach of a rattlesnake  (_Crotalus viridis helleri_) obtained on the desert slope of the  mountains.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 6, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: 6 mi. E Valyermo, 5600 ft., 1; 1 mi. E Big      Pines, 6600 ft., 2; 1 mi. S and 3 mi. W Big Pines, 6000 ft., 1;      1 mi. S and 2 mi. E Big Pines, 8100 ft., 2.      =Microtus californicus sanctidiegi= R. Kellogg    California Meadow Mouse    Owing to the paucity of extensive areas of grassland in the San  Gabriels, this is one of the least common rodents of the area. It  inhabits, however, even small patches of grassland up to 4000 feet  elevation on the Pacific slope, and is locally plentiful. For example, a  small patch of grassland amid the chaparral at the mouth of Palmer  Canyon supported many _Microtus_, and in San Antonio Canyon at about  3000 feet elevation meadow mice were found amid boulders and yuccas in a  small grassy area near the stream.        _Specimens examined._--Total, 3, distributed as follows: Los      Angeles County: San Antonio Canyon, 2800 ft., 1; Palmer Canyon,      2100 ft., 1; 4 mi. N Claremont, 1800 ft., 1.      Family URSIDAE      =Ursus americanus californiensis= J. Miller    Black Bear    Eleven black bears were introduced into the San Gabriel Mountains \"near  Crystal Lake\" in November 1933 from the Sierra Nevada (Burghduff,  1935:83). I do not know whether or not there have been subsequent  introductions. There are still bears present in the higher parts of the  mountains, especially north of the study area, where they seem to be  maintaining their numbers. The grizzly bear that formerly occurred in  the San Gabriel Mountains was exterminated there some years before the  black bear was introduced.      Family PROCYONIDAE      =Bassariscus astutus octavus= Hall    Ring-tailed Cat    Large sections of the San Gabriel Mountains are uninhabited by this  species, while locally, in the chaparral belt near water, ring-tails are  common. Many reports of ring-tails were received from owners of cabins  and homes who reside in the canyons at the Pacific base of the  mountains. Because of the distinctive appearance of this animal it is  likely that many of these reports were accurate. The reports testified  to the presence of ring-tails in San Gabriel Canyon, Dalton Canyon,  Palmer Canyon and San Antonio Canyon. Hall (1927:41) lists specimens  from San Antonio Canyon. Kenneth Hill of Upland told me that ring-tailed  cats often have been trapped above that town near citrus nurseries that  are regularly irrigated. This species probably is not present on the  desert slope of the range.    The only specimen that I took was a female weighing one pound and  fourteen ounces. It was trapped on March 24, 1951, among granite  boulders, beneath scrub oak and bay trees, near the mouth of Icehouse  Canyon, at 5500 feet elevation.      =Procyon lotor psora= Gray    Raccoon    The raccoon was one of the most common carnivores in the San Gabriels  and was found on both slopes of the range. Tracks were noted and one old  male was trapped at the base of the Pacific slope foothills at 1900 feet  elevation, and raccoons were captured at several localities from this  point up to 5500 feet in San Antonio Canyon. They were noted on Blue  Ridge at about 8000 feet elevation foraging around the camp grounds. On  the desert slope they occurred down to the lower edge of the  pinyon-juniper belt, for example near the mouth of Sheep Creek Canyon.    Sign of raccoons was most often found near water; tracks, however,  indicated that these animals, along with other carnivores, used fire  roads for traveling through the chaparral. In a small draw one-half mile  east of the mouth of Thompson Canyon two raccoons were trapped although  the only water was a series of small, disconnected seepage pools beneath  the valley oaks.    A raccoon freed from a small steel trap in San Antonio Canyon concealed  itself in an unusual but extremely effective manner. When released the  coon splashed up the middle of the small creek nearby to a place where  some dead alders had fallen over and shaded the water--here the animal  squatted down in the stream. The raccoon was mostly submerged, its tail  was floating, and its back and the top of its head and snout were above  water. With most of its body under water, and with the maze of alder  logs above casting a broken pattern of light and shade, it was well  hidden. When closely pressed the raccoon hid in the same manner several  times before it disappeared up a rocky draw into the scrub oak brush.    In the autumn of 1951, raccoons fed on grapes at the Sycamore Valley  Ranch one mile south of Devore. The one specimen (P. C.) saved, an old  male from 1/2 mi. W Palmer Canyon, had remains of beetles in its stomach  and weighed slightly more than 13 pounds.      Family MUSTELIDAE      =Mustela frenata latirostra= Hall    Long-tailed Weasel    Several weasels were found dead on roads in the coastal sage belt near  San Antonio and Lytle canyons.      =Taxidea taxus neglecta= Mearns    Badger    I found no sign of badgers on the Pacific slope of the range, but James  Wolfort, employed by the state Fish and Game Commission to trap coyotes,  reported that in 1948 he trapped also several badgers at the coastal  foot of the range in the San Fernando Valley area which is west of the  study area.      =Taxidea taxus berlandieri= Baird    Badger    Many old badger diggings were found in the Joshua tree woodland and  pinyon-juniper associations of the desert slope, but none of the animals  was observed nor were specimens secured. Mr. E. A. Eberle who has  trapped for many winters in the vicinity of Mescal Canyon stated that he  caught badgers occasionally.    I examined the skin of a badger taken at Llano which showed the  characteristic paleness of the desert subspecies _berlandieri_.      =Mephitis mephitis holzneri= Mearns"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34853"],[0,"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (#13)"],[1,"s:--    _Knock Ma Fairies._--'Knock Ma, which you see over there, is said to  contain excavated passages and a palace where the fairies live, and with  them the people they have _taken_. And from the inside of the hill there  is believed to be an entrance to an underground world. It is a common  opinion that after consumptives die they are there with the fairies in  good health. The wasted body is not taken into the hill, for it is  usually regarded as not the body of the deceased but rather as that of a  changeling, the general belief being that the real body and the soul are  carried off together, and those of an old person from Fairyland  substituted. The old person left soon declines and dies.'    _Safeguards against Fairies._--'It was proper when having finished  milking a cow to put one's thumb in the pail of milk, and with the wet  thumb to make the sign of the cross on the thigh of the cow on the side  milked, to be safe against fairies. And I have seen them when churning  put a live coal about an inch square under the churn, because it was an  old custom connected with fairies.'    _Milk and Butter for Fairies._--'Whatever milk falls on the ground in  milking a cow is taken by the fairies, for fairies need a little milk.  Also, after churning, the knife which is run through the butter in  drying it must not be scraped clean, for what sticks to it belongs to  the fairies. Out of three pounds of butter, for example, an ounce or two  would be left for the fairies. I have seen this several times.'    _Crossing a Stream, and Fairies._--'When out on a dark night, if pursued  by fairies or ghosts one is considered quite safe if one can get over  some stream. I remember coming home on a dark night with a boy companion  and hearing a noise, and then after we had run to a stream and crossed  it feeling quite safe.'    _Fairy Preserves._--'A heap of stones in a field should not be  disturbed, though needed for building--especially if they are part of an  ancient tumulus. The fairies are said to live inside the pile, and to  move the stones would be most unfortunate. If a house happens to be  built on a fairy preserve, or in a fairy track, the occupants will have  no luck. Everything will go wrong. Their animals will die, their  children fall sick, and no end of trouble will come on them. When the  house happens to have been built in a fairy track, the doors on the  front and back, or the windows if they are in the line of the track,  cannot be kept closed at night, for the fairies must march through. Near  Ballinrobe there is an old _fort_ which is still the preserve of the  fairies, and the land round it. The soil is very fine, and yet no one  would dare to till it. Some time ago in laying out a new road the  engineers determined to run it through the _fort_, but the people rose  almost in rebellion, and the course had to be changed. The farmers  wouldn't cut down a tree or bush growing on the hill or preserve for  anything.'    _Fairy Control over Crops._--'Fairies are believed to control crops and  their ripening. A field of turnips may promise well, and its owner will  count on so many tons to the acre, but if when the crop is gathered it  is found to be far short of the estimate, the explanation is that the  fairies have extracted so much substance from it. The same thing is the  case with corn.'    _November Eve and Fairies._--'On November Eve it is not right to gather  or eat blackberries or sloes, nor after that time as long as they last.  On November Eve the fairies pass over all such things and make them  unfit to eat. If one dares to eat them afterwards one will have serious  illness. We firmly believed this as boys, and I laugh now when I think  how we used to gorge ourselves with berries on the last day of October,  and then for weeks after pass by bushes full of the most luscious fruit,  and with mouths watering for it couldn't eat it.'    _Fairies as Flies._--'There is an old abbey on the river, in County  Mayo, and people say the fairies had a great battle near it, and that  the slaughter was tremendous. At the time, the fairies appeared as  swarms of flies coming from every direction to that spot. Some came from  Knock Ma, and some from South Ireland, the opinion being that fairies  can assume any form they like. The battle lasted a day and a night, and  when it was over one could have filled baskets with the dead flies which  floated down the river.'    _Those who Return from Faerie._--'Persons in a short trance-state of two  or three days' duration are said to be away with the fairies enjoying a  festival. The festival may be very material in its nature, or it may be  purely spiritual. Sometimes one may thus go to Faerie for an hour or  two; or one may remain there for seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years.  The mind of a person coming out of Fairyland is usually a blank as to  what has been seen and done there. Another idea is that the person knows  well enough all about Fairyland, but is prevented from communicating the  knowledge. A certain woman of whom I knew said she had forgotten all  about her experiences in Faerie, but a friend who heard her objected,  and said she did remember, and wouldn't tell. A man may remain awake at  night to watch one who has been to Fairyland to see if that one holds  communication with the fairies. Others say in such a case that the  fairies know you are on the alert, and will not be discovered.'      THE TESTIMONY OF A GALWAY PIPER    _Fairies=Sidheoga._--According to our next witness, Steven Ruan, a piper  of Galway, with whom I have often talked, there is one class of fairies  'who are nobody else than the spirits of men and women who once lived  on earth'; and the banshee is a dead friend, relative, or ancestor who  appears to give a warning. 'The fairies', he says, 'never care about old  folks. They only _take_ babies, and young men and young women. If a  young wife dies, she is said to have been _taken_ by _them_, and ever  afterwards to live in Fairyland. The same things are said about a young  man or a child who dies. Fairyland is a place of delights, where music,  and singing, and dancing, and feasting are continually enjoyed; and its  inhabitants are all about us, as numerous as the blades of grass.'    _A Fairy Dog._--In the course of another conversation, Steven pointed to  a rocky knoll in a field not far from his home, and said:--'I saw a dog  with a white ring around his neck by that hill there, and the oldest men  round Galway have seen him, too, for he has been here for one hundred  years or more. He is a dog of the _good people_, and only appears at  certain hours of the night.'    _An Old Piper in Fairyland._--And before we had done talking, the  subject of fairy-music came up, and the following little story coming  from one of the last of the old Irish pipers himself, about a brother  piper, is of more than ordinary value:--'There used to be an old piper  called Flannery who lived in Oranmore, County Galway. I imagine he was  one of the old generation. And one time the _good people_ took him to  Fairyland to learn his profession. He studied music with them for a long  time, and when he returned he was as great a piper as any in Ireland.  But he died young, for the _good people_ wanted him to play for them.'      THE TESTIMONY OF 'OLD PATSY' OF ARANMORE    Our next witness is an old man, familiarly called 'Old Patsy', who is a  native of the Island of Aranmore, off the coast from Galway, and he  lives on the island amid a little group of straw-thatched fishermen's  homes called Oak Quarter. As 'Old Patsy' stood beside a rude stone cross  near Oak Quarter, in one of those curious places on Aranmore, where each  passing funeral stops long enough to erect a little memorial pile of  stones on the smooth rocky surface of the roadside enclosure, he told me  many anecdotes about the mysteries of his native island.    _Aranmore Fairies._--Twenty years or so ago round the _Bedd_ of Dermot  and Grania, just above us on the hill, there were seen many fairies,  'crowds of them,' said 'Old Patsy', and a single deer. They began to  chase the deer, and followed it right over the island. At another time  similar little people chased a horse. 'The rocks were full of them, and  they were small fellows.'    _A Fairy Beating--in a Dream._--'In the South Island,' he continued, 'as  night was coming on, a man was giving his cow water at a well, and, as  he looked on the other side of a wall, he saw many strange people  playing hurley. When they noticed him looking at them, one came up and  struck the cow a hard blow, and turning on the man cut his face and body  very badly. The man might not have been so badly off, but he returned to  the well after the first encounter and got five times as bad a beating;  and when he reached home he couldn't speak at all, until the cock crew.  Then he told about his adventures, and slept a little. When he woke up  in the daylight he was none the worse for his beating, for the fairies  had rubbed something on his face.' Patsy says he knew the man, who if  still alive is now in America, where he went several years ago.    _Where Fairies Live._--When I asked Patsy where the fairies live, he  turned half around, and pointing in the direction of Dun Aengus, which  was in full view on the sharp sky-line of Aranmore, said that there, in  a large tumulus on the hill-side below it, they had one of their  favourite abodes. But, he added, 'The rocks are full of them, and they  are small fellows.' Just across the road from where we were standing, in  a spot near Oak Quarter, another place was pointed out where the fairies  are often seen dancing. The name of it is _Moneen an Damhsa_, 'the  Little Bog of the Dance.' Other sorts of fairies live in the sea; and  some of them who live on Aranmore (probably in conjunction with those in  the sea) go out over the water and cause storms and wind.
