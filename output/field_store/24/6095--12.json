Many come with but one  purpose--to prolong their lives. I believe that those who receive gland  transplantation will live much longer than without it. Possibly as much  as from 10 to 25 years can be added. Then successive transplants can be  made, and we have no idea how long they will live. Their skin takes on  the appearance of youth. I know that after the ovaries have been  transplanted into women who have none their menses return on a 4-day  period regularly. Women who had passed the menopause have a return flow.  Hardening of the arteries as well as high blood pressure are returned to  normal in 100 per cent of the cases. Eyesight is improved from 50 to 100  per cent. A well-known judge was operated upon by me a short time ago,  and his eyesight was so much improved that he could no longer wear  glasses of any kind. Men who had not heard for 16 years write me that  since gland transplantation they can hear the tick of a watch. In women  a development of the bust is noted and the wrinkles disappear from their  cheeks. Chronic constipation is cured as well as old chronic skin  diseases, such as psoriasis, eczema, etc.    With the best will in the world I am unable to describe on paper just  how my fellow practitioners should perform this operation, because I  never meet with precisely similar conditions in any two cases. I can say  positively that I do not know just what I shall do until the case itself  is under my hands in the operating room. The operation is simple in  itself, but in my early days of operating I made a number of mistakes  because I was on new ground, and there was no authority from whom I  could learn the technique. Now, after my six hundred operations have  taught me what to do and how to do I am able to avoid these earlier  mistakes, and as a consequence I hardly ever have an operation that is  not a success. Not very many months ago I was called to San Francisco to  re-operate on a number of cases which had gone wrong in the hands of a  fellow practitioner. I re-operated on these cases successfully. The  surgeon who had performed the operation in the first place is skilful  and experienced in all lines of surgical work, but in this particular  line of transplanting of goat-glands into human bodies in such wise that  the tissue of the goat will blend with and nourish the human tissue no  living man except myself has had the necessary experience to teach him  through his successes and failures, what to do and how to do it. Nor  should I be successful if today, in spite of all the work I have done  with the Goat-Glands, I should relinguish the goat-gland in favor of the  human-gland or the monkey-gland. Results have taught me that I made a  wise choice in pinning my faith to the young goat as the healthiest  possible animal from which tissue could be used for transplanting into  human bodies. The goat is immune to practically all diseases. The human  being and the monkey, on the other hand, are liable to tuberculous or  some tropical disease. For his splendid work with human glands I give  full credit to Dr. Frank Lydston of Chicago, who was not only the  pioneer in this use of human glands, but actually made his first  transplantation upon himself. This is but another instance of that fine  confidence in our beliefs and convictions which is typical of the  medical profession as a whole. In the use of the human-gland Dr. Lydston  is as supreme as I am in the use of the goat-gland, and you must  understand that in saying this I am not throwing bouquets at myself in  idle vanity. I have a clear cold reason for saying this. I have devoted  my life to this particular work, and have brought it to a point where I  can speak with authority upon it. I foresee that because of the  marvelous results obtained by the transplanting of the goat-glands at my  hospital there will be a great awakening of interest in this operation  on the part of the public and the medical profession. A great many  operations of a similar character will be performed not alone in this  country, but all over the world. A great many of these operations will  be unsuccessful because the experience of the operator will not have  taught him what to do under certain unusual conditions, or rather, what  to do under any and all conditions. In the face of an unsuccessful  operation this work will be blamed, and the theory upon which I work,  namely, that the sex-energy is the basis of all human energy, physical  and mental, will be given a setback, and scouted as untrue. But I am  constantly proving its truth by the results I get, and find its  confirmation in the effect of successful goat-gland transplantation in  both men and women. Therefore I am urgent in saying that the work must  be rightly done in the first place to obtain right results.    Briefly, the operation for men means that the glands of a three weeks'  old male goat are laid upon the non-functioning glands of a man, within  twenty minutes of the time they are removed from the goat. In some cases  I open the human gland and lay the tissue of the goat within the human  gland. The scrotum of the man is opened by incision on both sides under  local anesthetic. Conditions of the case may show that there are  adhesions of tissue which must also be broken down before the new gland  can function. I find that after being properly connected these  goat-glands do actually feed, grow into, and become absorbed by the  human glands, and the man is renewed in his physical and mental vigor.    The operation upon women means that the ovaries of a female goat not  more than twelve months of age are removed and inserted into the woman.  If the woman's organs are sound and merely inert and atrophied, the new  ovary will find its way to its proper position and begin the work of  restoring the arrested functions, so that the act of menstruation, for  example, which has ceased because of the atrophic condition of the  woman's ovaries, begins again and continues on a normal twenty-eight day  period. The effect of the new glands upon women is even more noticeable,  if such a thing were possible, than upon men, since in their case the  rejuvenation is more striking in the changed appearance. But though I  claim much, and with good reason, for this operation, I warn against  undue expectations. In many cases I advise against the operation as a  sure waste of time and money. In many cases I explain that the results  will be experimental only, there being nothing in my experience to  warrant assurance of success. For instance, in blindness and deafness I  have no faith that this operation will remove the disease in spite of  the fact that in almost every case operated upon there is great  improvement in the sight and hearing. But I have no certain knowledge  why this improvement followed. It partakes, therefore, of the nature of  an accident. In the case of very fat people the operation trims them  down to normal weight. Very thin people are built up to normal weight by  it. Barren women and impotent men become mothers and fathers. But in no  case do I permit a grandfather or grandmother to entertain the hope that  they may be rejuvenated to such an extent that they can procreate again  if they wish. This is mere romance, with which I have nothing to do. Nor  do I advise a young woman of forty who has not reached the menopause  stage to take the operation if she is in good health, in spite of her  belief that the goat-glands will enable her to remain indefinitely  young. This is experimental work, and is not in the same class as the  case of the same woman who has just passed through her menopause and  ceased to menstruate. By all means I advise the latter to take the  operation because I feel that it will rejuvenate her. If a woman has had  both ovaries removed by surgical operation, will this operation grow new  ovaries for her, and enable her to become a mother? At this stage of my  knowledge my answer is, \"Certainly not.\" If a man has lost both glands  by surgical removal will this operation grow new glands for him? Nine  times out of ten, \"No.\" The tenth time, \"Yes.\" I do not know why.    I can use only a certain breed of goat, a Swiss milk goat, and only  animals of a certain youth. My goats cost me about $75 each on an  average, and that is one reason why it would be impossible to conduct  this work as a free surgical clinic might be conducted, unless the  undertaking were specially endowed with funds to meet the expense.    Some time in the month of June I expect to make a trip to London,  England, and will be away possibly until the end of August. Even the  month of May in Kansas is sometimes too hot for this operation to be  successfully performed, and I make it a rule to suspend operations  entirely throughout June, July and August. Experience has taught me that  when the outdoor temperature is high the operation will almost certainly  be unsuccessful, and on account of the cost involved, as well as for the  saving of time and trouble for the patient, it is in the highest degree  unwise to go contrary to this rule. If the glands are transplanted  during very hot weather they will almost certainly slough, which means  re-operating later.    In many cases that are brought to me I do not operate or even advise  that the goat-glands be transplanted later. I cannot go into details of  such cases in these pages, but might cite the case of a man, syphilitic,  who was sent to me. Certainly I have never made the statement anywhere,  at any time, that this operation would cure syhpilis. The man is being  treated now for syphilis, and should not have been sent to me at all.    I quote the case of a woman of forty, who is normal in every way, and  the picture of health at the present time. Her desire is that she may  never grow to look any older than she does at this moment, and she asks  me if this gland-operation"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29420"],[0,"American Rural Highways (#13)"],[1,"when dry and therefore resist to a degree the  tendency of vehicles to grind away the particles and dissipate them in  the form of dust. Such soils retain a reasonably smooth trackway in  dry weather even when subjected to considerable traffic. Other soils  do not possess the inherent tenacity and stability to enable them to  resist the action of wheels and consequently grind away rapidly. Roads  on such soils become very dusty. These are the extremes and between  them are many types of soils or mixtures of soils possessing varying  degrees of stability, and, in consequence, differing rates of wear.  Similarly the various soils exhibit different degrees of stability  when wet.    It is to be expected that soils will differ with the geographical  location, for it is well known that there is a great variation in  soils in the various parts of the world. But wide differences are also  encountered in the soil on roads very near each other and even on  successive stretches of the same road. It is for this reason that  earth roads often exhibit great differences in serviceability even in  a restricted area.    =Variation in Rainfall.=--The stability of a soil and its ability to  support the weight of vehicles varies greatly with the amount of water  in the soil. A certain small amount of moisture in the soil is  beneficial in that practically every soil compacts more readily when  moist than when dry because the moisture aids in binding together the  particles. But most soils also become unstable when the amount of  water present is in excess of that small amount referred to above and  the stability decreases very rapidly as the amount of water in the  soil increases.    The serviceability of an earth road will change continually as the  moisture content of the soil changes and consequently the general  utility of the earth road system in any locality is dependent to a  considerable extent upon the amount and seasonal distribution of  precipitation. The methods of maintaining earth roads appropriate to  any locality must of necessity be adapted to the climatic conditions,  and the amount of work required to give the highest possible degree of  serviceability will be exceedingly variable from season to season and  from place to place. In regions of great humidity, earth roads may be  expected to have a low average of serviceability, while in arid  regions they may possess sufficient durability for a considerable  volume of traffic. The design adopted for earth roads and the methods  of maintenance followed should therefore be carefully evolved to meet  the soil and climate conditions where the roads are located. These  will differ greatly throughout a state or even a county.    =Cross Sections.=--The general principles of road design were set  forth in Chapter IV. In Fig. 11 are shown typical cross sections for  earth roads adapted to various conditions as indicated. It is not  apparent that one form of ditch is particularly preferable to the  other and since some engineers prefer the V section and others the  trapezoidal section both are shown. It would appear that the V shaped  ditch is somewhat the easier to construct with the blade grader while  the trapezoidal is readily excavated with the slip or fresno scraper.  The ditch capacity required and consequently the dimensions will  depend upon the drainage requirements, as was pointed out in Chapter  III.    [Illustration: Fig. 11. Cross Section for Earth Roads]      EARTH ROADS IN REGIONS OF CONSIDERABLE RAINFALL    In the zones where the annual precipitation exceeds 30 inches  distributed over several months, earth roads will be unserviceable for  a considerable period each year unless they are constructed so as to  minimize the effect of water. This is done by providing for the best  possible drainage and by adopting a method of maintenance that will  restore the surface to a smooth condition as quickly as possible after  a period of rainy weather or after the \"frost comes out\" in the  spring.    Before the construction of the desired cross section is undertaken,  all of the grade reduction should be completed, except for minor cuts  which can be handled with the elevating grader in the manner that will  be described presently.    Where any considerable change in grade is to be effected, the earth  can be moved in several ways and of these the most economical cannot  be readily determined. Ordinarily a contractor or a county will use  the equipment that happens to be at hand even though some other might  be more advantageous.    =Elevating Grader.=--Where the topography is such as to permit its  use, the elevating grader is employed in grade reduction to load the  earth into dump wagons in which it is hauled to the fill or waste  bank. The elevating grader consists essentially of a heavy shear plow  or disc plow which loosens the earth and deposits it on a moving  canvas apron. The apron carries the material up an incline and  deposits it into a wagon which is driven along under the end of the  apron. When the wagon is loaded, the grader is stopped while the  loaded wagon is hauled out and an empty one drawn into position. The  motive power for the elevating grader is either a tractor or five or  six teams of mules. For many kinds of work, particularly where  frequent turning is necessary or where the ground is yielding, mules  are preferable to a tractor. The apron is operated by gearing from the  rear wheels of the grader. Generally four mules are hitched to a  pusher in the rear of the grader and six or eight in the lead. This  method of grade reduction is particularly advantageous when the  material must be hauled a distance of 500 yards or more, because wagon  hauling in such cases is the most economical method to employ. A  tractor may be used to draw the elevating grader and one having a  commercial rating of 30 to 45 horsepower is required.    =Maney Grader.=--If the haul is long and the nature of the cut will  not permit the use of the elevating grader because of excessive grades  or lack of room for turning, a grader of the Maney type may be used.  This consists of a scoop of about one cubic yard capacity, suspended  from a four-wheel wagon gear. When loading, the scoop is let down and  filled in the same manner as a two-wheeled scraper or \"wheeler.\" The  pull required to fill a Maney grader is so great that a tractor is  ordinarily employed in place of a \"snap\" team. The tractor is hitched  at the end of the tongue, without interfering with the team drawing  the grader. One team readily handles the grader after it is loaded.  For this service a tractor having a commercial rationing of 25 to 30  horsepower is required.    =Wheel Scraper.=--For moving earth for distances between 150 and 500  yards, the wheel scraper of a capacity of about 1-1/2 yards is quite  generally employed. The soil must be loosened with a plow before it  can conveniently be loaded into the wheeler and a heavy plow is  ordinarily employed for that purpose. Two furrows with the plow will  loosen a strip of earth about as wide as the scoop of the scraper and  if more is loosened it will be packed down by the scrapers wheeling in  place to load. A helper or \"snap\" team is employed to assist in  loading, after which the wheel scraper is handled by one team.    =Slip Scraper.=--The slip scraper differs from the wheel scraper in  that the scoop is not suspended from wheels but is dragged along the  ground. It is drawn by one team and the capacity is two to five cubic  feet, but the material spills out to some extent as the scraper is  dragged along and the method is not suitable for long hauls, 100 feet  being about the economical limit.    =Fresno Scraper.=--The Fresno scraper is one form of slip scraper  requiring four horses or mules for efficient work. It differs  somewhat from the ordinary slip scraper in shape and is of larger  capacity, but is a drag type of scraper much favored in the western  states.      SHAPING TO PROPER CROSS SECTION    If a road has been graded so that the profile is satisfactory or if  the existing profile of the location is satisfactory, and the surface  is to be shaped to a prescribed cross section, either the elevating  grader or the blade grader may be employed.    =Elevating Grader Work.=--If the elevating grader is used in shaping  the earth road, the apron will be lowered and the material will be  excavated at the sides of the road and deposited on the middle  portion. If slight changes in grade are desired, wagons will accompany  the grader and catch under the apron at the high places and haul the  material to the low places. After the earth has been deposited it must  be worked over to secure the correct cross section and be made  passable for vehicles. This requires that clods be broken, weeds and  grass that are mixed with the earth be removed by harrowing and  forking and that the surface be carefully smoothed with a blade  grader. This latter operation will have to be repeated several times  before a satisfactory surface is secured. But this miscellaneous work  is highly important and under no circumstances ought to be neglected.  Nothing so detracts from an otherwise creditable piece of work as  failure to provide a smooth surface for the use of vehicles. It is  especially uncomfortable for the users of a highway if sods and weeds  in quantity are left in the road after it has been graded. The humus  that will be left in the soil as the vegetable matter decays increases  the porosity of the road surface making it more absorbent than soil  without humus. This increases the susceptibility to softening from  storm water or ground water.    The tractor can advantageously be used to draw the elevating grader on  this class of work, but will be greatly handicapped if there are wet  sections along the road, through which the tractor must be driven. In  many cases its use is prohibited by such conditions and for all-round  service of this"]]]
