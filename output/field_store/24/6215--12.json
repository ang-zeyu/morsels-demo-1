Presently he found himself being lifted off the couch and put in a  chair, and heard some one saying: \"Do not hurt him; wake him gently,\"  and on opening his eyes he found himself surrounded by numbers of  snakes, one of them wearing beautiful royal colors.    \"Hullo!\" he cried; \"who are you?\"    \"I am Sulta'nee Waa' Neeo'ka, king of the snakes, and this is my  house. Who are you?\"    \"I am Hasseeboo Kareem Ed Deen.\"    \"Where do you come from?\"    \"I don't know where I come from, or where I'm going.\"    \"Well, don't bother yourself just now. Let's eat; I guess you are  hungry, and I know I am.\"    Then the king gave orders, and some of the other snakes brought the  finest fruits, and they ate and drank and conversed.    When the repast was ended, the king desired to hear Hasseeboo's story;  so he told him all that had happened, and then asked to hear the  story of his host.    \"Well,\" said the king of the snakes, \"mine is rather a long story,  but you shall hear it. A long time ago I left this place, to go  and live in the mountains of Al Kaaf', for the change of air. One  day I saw a stranger coming along, and I said to him, 'Where are you  from?' and he said, 'I am wandering in the wilderness.' 'Whose son are  you?' I asked. 'My name is Bolookee'a. My father was a sultan; and  when he died I opened a small chest, inside of which I found a bag,  which contained a small brass box; when I had opened this I found  some writing tied up in a woolen cloth, and it was all in praise of  a prophet. He was described as such a good and wonderful man, that  I longed to see him; but when I made inquiries concerning him I was  told he was not yet born. Then I vowed I would wander until I should  see him. So I left our town, and all my property, and I am wandering,  but I have not yet seen that prophet.'    \"Then I said to him, 'Where do you expect to find him, if he's not  yet born? Perhaps if you had some serpent's water you might keep on  living until you find him. But it's of no use talking about that;  the serpent's water is too far away.'    \"'Well,' he said, 'good-bye. I must wander on.' So I bade him farewell,  and he went his way.    \"Now, when that man had wandered until he reached Egypt, he met  another man, who asked him, 'Who are you?'    \"'I am Bolookeea. Who are you?'    \"'My name is Al Faan'. Where are you going?'    \"'I have left my home, and my property, and I am seeking the prophet.    \"'H'm!' said Al Faan; 'I can tell you of a better occupation than  looking for a man that is not born yet. Let us go and find the king  of the snakes and get him to give us a charm medicine; then we will  go to King Solomon and get his rings, and we shall be able to make  slaves of the genii and order them to do whatever we wish.'    \"And Bolookeea said, 'I have seen the king of the snakes in the  mountain of Al Kaaf.'    \"'All right,' said Al Faan; 'let's go.'    \"Now, Al Faan wanted the ring of Solomon that he might be a great  magician and control the genii and the birds, while all Bolookeea  wanted was to see the great prophet.    \"As they went along, Al Faan said to Bolookeea, 'Let us make a cage  and entice the king of the snakes into it; then we will shut the door  and carry him off.'    \"'All right,' said Bolookeea.    \"So they made a cage, and put therein a cup of milk and a cup of wine,  and brought it to Al Kaaf; and I, like a fool, went in, drank up all  the wine and became drunk. Then they fastened the door and took me  away with them.    \"When I came to my senses I found myself in the cage, and Bolookeea  carrying me, and I said, 'The sons of Adam are no good. What do you  want from me?' And they answered, 'We want some medicine to put on  our feet, so that we may walk upon the water whenever it is necessary  in the course of our journey.' 'Well,' said I, 'go along.'    \"We went on until we came to a place where there were a great number  and variety of trees; and when those trees saw me, they said, 'I am  medicine for this;' 'I am medicine for that;' 'I am medicine for the  head;' 'I am medicine for the feet;' and presently one tree said,  'If any one puts my medicine upon his feet he can walk on water.'    \"When I told that to those men they said, 'That is what we want;'  and they took a great deal of it.    \"Then they took me back to the mountain and set me free; and we said  good-bye and parted.    \"When they left me, they went on their way until they reached the sea,  when they put the medicine on their feet and walked over. Thus they  went many days, until they came near to the place of King Solomon,  where they waited while Al Faan prepared his medicines.    \"When they arrived at King Solomon's place, he was sleeping, and was  being watched by genii, and his hand lay on his chest, with the ring  on his finger.    \"As Bolookeea drew near, one of the genii said to him 'Where are you  going?' And he answered, 'I'm here with Al Faan; he's going to take  that ring.' 'Go back,' said the genie; 'keep out of the way. That  man is going to die.'    \"When Al Faan had finished his preparations, he said to Bolookeea,  'Wait here for me.' Then he went forward to take the ring, when a  great cry arose, and he was thrown by some unseen force a considerable  distance.    \"Picking himself up, and still believing in the power of his medicines,  he approached the ring again, when a strong breath blew upon him and  he was burnt to ashes in a moment.    \"While Bolookeea was looking at all this, a voice said, 'Go your  way; this wretched being is dead.' So he returned; and when he got  to the sea again he put the medicine upon his feet and passed over,  and continued to wander for many years.    \"One morning he saw a man sitting down, and said 'Good-morning,' to  which the man replied. Then Bolookeea asked him, 'Who are you?' and  he answered: 'My name is Jan Shah. Who are you?' So Bolookeea told  him who he was, and asked him to tell him his history. The man, who  was weeping and smiling by turns, insisted upon hearing Bolookeea's  story first. After he had heard it he said:    \"'Well, sit down, and I'll tell you my story from beginning to end. My  name is Jan Shah, and my father is Tooeegha'mus, a great sultan. He  used to go every day into the forest to shoot game; so one day I said  to him, \"Father, let me go with you into the forest to-day;\" but he  said, \"Stay at home. You are better there.\" Then I cried bitterly,  and as I was his only child, whom he loved dearly, he couldn't stand  my tears, so he said: \"Very well; you shall go. Don't cry.\"    \"'Thus we went to the forest, and took many attendants with us; and  when we reached the place we ate and drank, and then every one set  out to hunt.    \"'I and my seven slaves went on until we saw a beautiful gazelle,  which we chased as far as the sea without capturing it. When the  gazelle took to the water I and four of my slaves took a boat, the  other three returning to my father, and we chased that gazelle until  we lost sight of the shore, but we caught it and killed it. Just then  a great wind began to blow, and we lost our way.    \"'When the other three slaves came to my father, he asked them,  \"Where is your master?\" and they told him about the gazelle and the  boat. Then he cried, \"My son is lost! My son is lost!\" and returned  to the town and mourned for me as one dead.    \"'After a time we came to an island, where there were a great many  birds. We found fruit and water, we ate and drank, and at night we  climbed into a tree and slept till morning.    \"'Then we rowed to a second island, and, seeing no one around, we  gathered fruit, ate and drank, and climbed a tree as before. During  the night we heard many savage beasts howling and roaring near us.    \"'In the morning we got away as soon as possible, and came to a third  island. Looking around for food, we saw a tree full of fruit like  red-streaked apples; but, as we were about to pick some, we heard a  voice say, \"Don't touch this tree; it belongs to the king.\" Toward  night a number of monkeys came, who seemed much pleased to see us,  and they brought us all the fruit we could eat.    \"'Presently I heard one of them say, \"Let us make this man our  sultan.\" Then another one said: \"What's the use? They'll all run  away in the morning.\" But a third one said, \"Not if we smash their  boat.\" Sure enough, when we started to leave in the morning, our boat  was broken in pieces. So there was nothing for it but to stay there  and be entertained by the monkeys, who seemed to like us very much.    \"'One day, while strolling about, I came upon a great stone house,  having an inscription on the door, which said, \"When any man comes to  this island, he will find it difficult to leave, because the monkeys  desire to have a man for their king. If he looks for a way to escape,  he will think there is none; but there is one outlet, which lies to  the north. If you go in that direction you will come to a great plain,  which is infested with lions, leopards, and snakes. You must fight all  of them; and if you overcome them you can go forward. You will then  come to another great plain, inhabited by ants as big as dogs; their  teeth are like those of dogs, and they are very fierce. You must fight  these also, and if you overcome them, the rest of the way is clear.\"    \"'I consulted with my attendants over this information, and we came  to the conclusion that, as we could only die, anyhow, we might as  well risk death to gain our freedom.    \"'As we all had weapons, we set forth; and when we came to the first  plain we fought, and two of my slaves were killed. Then we went on  to the second plain, fought again; my other two slaves were killed,  and I alone escaped.    \"'After that I wandered on for many days, living on whatever I could  find, until at last I came to a town, where I stayed for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],[0,"The Psychology of Beauty (#13)"],[1,"the contemplated object  is the cause of this arrest and repose.  God, the circle of  the Infinite, the Eternal One, enter into play as \"unity\"  alone.  What, then, of the content?  After the analogy of  the extreme case, the content--that is, emotional value  and definite emotional tone--takes the place of the external  suggestion.  Under just the conditions of the religious  trance, the element of reverence, of joyous sentiment, is  able suddenly to take on a more vivid aspect.  It may not  be that the emotion itself is greater, but it now holds the  field.  It may not be that it is more intense, but the  intensity of concentration which takes on its color makes  it seem so.  The \"rapture\" is just the sense of being caught  up into union with the highest; the joy of the rapture is  the joy of every thought of God, here left free to brighten  into ecstasy; and its \"revelation-value\" is again the sense  of immediate union with a Being the intellectual concept of  whom is immensely vivified.    So may be analyzed the aesthetic ecstasy.  The tension of  those mutually antagonistic impulses which make balance, and  so unity, and so the conditions for loss of sense of self,  clears the way for tasting the full savor of pleasure in  bright color, flowing line, exquisite tone-sequence, moving  thought.  Many a commonplace experience, says M. Souriau,  suddenly takes on a charm when seen in the arrested aesthetic  vision.  \"Every one can have observed that an object in itself  agreeable to look on, like a bouquet of flowers, or the fresh  face of a young girl, takes on a sort of magic and supernatural  beauty if we regard it mechanically while listening to music.\"<1>  The intensity of concentration caused by the unity of form  fuses with this suggested vividness of feeling from content  and material, and the whole is felt as intensity of aesthetic  emotion.  The Sistine Madonna would not strike so deep in  feeling were it less crystalline in its unity, less trance-like  in its repose, and so less enchanting in its suggestion.    <1> P. Souriau, _La Suggestion en l'Art._    So it is not only the man of achievement who sees but one thing  at a time.  To enter intensely into any ideal experience means  to be blind to all others.  One must lose one's own soul to  gain the world, and none who enter and return from the paradise  of selfless ecstasy will question that it is gained.  It may  be that personality is a hindrance and a barrier, and that we  are only truly in harmony with the secret of our own existence  when we cease to set ourselves over against the world.  Nevertheless, the sense of individuality is a possession for  which the most of mankind would pay the price, if it must be  paid, even of eternal suffering.  The delicious hour of fusion  with the universe is precious, so it seems to us now, just  because we can return from it to our own nest, and, close and  warm there, count up our happiness.  The fragmentariness and  multiplicity of life are, then, the saving of the sense of  selfhood, and we must indeed       \"Rejoice that man is hurled   From change to change unceasingly,   His soul's wings never furled.\"      IV  THE BEAUTY OF FINE ART      IV  A.  THE BEAUTY OF VISUAL FORM    I    IN what consists the Beauty of Visual Form?  The older writers  on what we now know as the science of art did not ask themselves  this question.  Although we are accustomed to hear that order,  symmetry, unity in variety, was the Greek, and in particular  the Platonic, formula for beauty, we observe, on examining the  passages cited in evidence, that it is rather the moral quality  appertaining to these characteristics that determines them as  beautiful; symmetry is beautiful, because harmonious, and  inducing order and self-restraint.  Aristotle's single  pronouncement in the sense of our question is the dictum:  there  is no beauty without a certain magnitude.  Lessing, in his  \"Laocoon,\" really the first modern treatise in aesthetics,  discusses the excellences of painting and poetry, but deals  with visible beauty as if it were a fixed quality, understood  when referred to, like color.  This is undoubtedly due to his  unconscious reference of beauty to the human form alone; a  reference which he would have denied, but which influences his  whole aesthetic theory.  In speaking of a beautiful picture, for  instance, he would have meant first of all the representation  of beautiful persons in it, hardly at all that essential beauty  of the picture as painting, to which every inch of the canvas  is alike precious.  It is clear to us now, however, that the  beauty of the human form is the most obscure of all possible  cases, complex in itself, and overlaid and involved as it is  with innumerable interests and motives of extra-aesthetic  character. Beauty in simple forms must be our first study;  and great credit is due to Hogarth for having propounded in  his \"Analysis of Beauty\" the simple question,--what makes the  quality of beauty to the eye?    But in visible beauty, the aesthetic value of pure form is  not the only element involved:  or at least is must be  settled whether or not it is the only element involved.  If  in a work of art, as we believe, what belongs to its excellence  belongs to its beauty, we may not applaud one painter, for  instance, for his marvelous color-schemes, another for his  expression of emotion, another for his delineation of  character, without acknowledging that expression of character  and emotion come within our concept of visible beauty.  Franz  von Lenbach was once asked what he thought likely to be the  fate of his own work.  \"As for that,\" he replied, \"I think I  may possibly have a chance of living; but ONLY if  Individualization or Characterization be deemed to constitute  a quality of permanent value in a picture.  This, however, I  shall never know, for it can only be adjudged by posterity.  If that verdict should prove unfavorable, then my work, too,  will perish with the rest,--for it cannot compare on their  lines with the great masters of the past.\"  That this is  indeed an issue is shown by the contrasting opinion of the  critic who exclaimed before a portrait, \"Think away the  head and face, and you will have a wonderful effect of color!\"  The analysis of visible beauty accordingly resolves itself  into the explanation of the beauty of form (including shape  and color) and the fixing in relation thereto of other  factors.    The most difficult part of our task is indeed behind us.  We  have already defined Beauty in general:  we have outlined  in a preceding essay the abstract aesthetic demands, and we  have now only to ask through what psychological means these  demands can be and are in fact met.  In other words we have  to show that what we intensely feel as Beauty can and does  exemplify these principles, and through them is explained and  accounted for.  Beauty has been defined as that combination  of qualities in the object which brings about a union of  stimulation and repose in the enjoyer.  How must this be  interpreted with reference to the particular facts of visual  form?    The most immediate reference is naturally to the sense organ  itself; and the first question is therefore as to the  favorable stimulations of the eye.  What, in general, does  the eye demand of its object?      II    The simplest element of visual experience is of course found  in light and color, the sensation of the eye as such.  Yet  there is no branch of aesthetic which is so incomplete.  We  know that the sensation of light or color, if not too weak  or too violent, is in itself pleasing.  The bright, the  glittering, shining object, so long as it is not painful,  is pleasantly stimulating.  Gems, tinsel, lacquer, polish,  testify to this taste, from the most primitive to the most  civilized man.  Color, too, if distinct, not over-bright,  nor too much extended in field, is in itself pleasing.  The  single colors have been the object of comparatively little  study.  Experiment seems to show that the colors containing  most brightness--white, red, and yellow--are preferred.  Baldwin, in his \"dynamogenic\" experiments,<1> based on \"the  view that the infant's hand movements in reaching or  grasping are the best index of the kind and intensity of  its sensory experiences,\" finds that the colors range  themselves in order of attractiveness, blue, white, red,  green, brown.  Further corrections lay more emphasis upon  the white.  Yellow was not included in the experiments.  Cohn's results, which show a relative dislike of yellow,  are contradicted by other observers, notably Major and  Baker,<2> and (unpublished) experiments of my own, including  the aesthetic preferences of seven or eight different sets  of students at Radcliffe and Wellesley colleges.  Experiments  of this kind are particularly difficult, inasmuch as the  material, usually colored paper, varies considerably from  the spectral color, and differences in saturation, hue, and  brightness make great differences in the results, while the  feeling-tone of association, individual or racial, very  often intrudes.  But other things being equal, the bright,  the clear, the saturated color is relatively more pleasing,  and white, red, and yellow seem especially preferred.    <1> _Mental Development in the Child and the Race_, 1895,  pp. 39, 50, ff.  <2> E.

Now, according to the Hering theory of color, white, red, and  yellow are the so-called \"dissimilating\" colors in the three  pairs, white-black, red-green, and yellow-blue, corresponding  to three hypothetical visual substances in the retina.  These  substances, that is, in undergoing a kind of chemical  disintegration under the action of light-rays, are supposed to  give the sensations white, red, or yellow respectively, and in"]]]
