If it  were not for him, I should perhaps have been happy to-day; my love might  have moved your heart. However, I have become resigned to my loss, and  since your choice has fallen on him,\"--and here he sighed,--\"well, all I  can say is, I hope you may never regret it.\"    \"Many thanks for your goodwill, cousin; I am delighted to find you in  such a benevolent mood. You must not be vexed because I could not give  you the kind of love you wanted; the heart, you know, is not amenable to  reason.\"    \"There is only one thing I should like to ask.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"I mention it for your good more than for my own. If you want to be  happy, don't let this handsome quill-driver get you entirely into his  hands. You are saying to yourself that because of my ill-success with  you I am trying to injure him; but what if I could prove that he does  not love you as much as he pretends--?\"    \"Come, come, control your naughty tongue! Are you going to begin  backbiting again? You are playing a mean part, Trumeau. I have never  hinted to Maitre Quennebert all the nasty little ways in which you have  tried to put a spoke in his wheel, for if he knew he would ask you to  prove your words, and then you would look very foolish.\".    \"Not at all, I swear to you. On the contrary, if I were to tell all I  know in his presence, it is not I who would be disconcerted. Oh! I am  weary of meeting with nothing from you but snubs, scorn, and abuse. You  think me a slanderer when I say, 'This gallant wooer of widows does not  love you for yourself but for your money-bags. He fools you by fine  promises, but as to marrying you--never, never!'\"    \"May I ask you to repeat that?\" broke in Madame Rapally    \"Oh! I know what I am saying. You will never be Madame Quennebert.\"    \"Really?\"    \"Really.\"    \"Jealousy has eaten away whatever brains you used to possess, Trumeau.  Since I saw you last, cousin, important changes have taken place: I was  just going to send you to-day an invitation to my wedding.\"    \"To your wedding?\"    \"Yes; I am to be married to-morrow.\"    \"To-morrow? To Quennebert?\" stammered Trumeau.    \"To Quennebert,\" repeated the widow in a tone of triumph.    \"It's not possible!\" exclaimed Trumeau.    \"It is so possible that you will see us united tomorrow. And for the  future I must beg of you to regard Quennebert no longer as a rival but  as my husband, whom to offend will be to offend me.\"    The tone in which these words were spoken no longer left room for doubt  as to the truth of the news. Trumeau looked down for a few moments, as  if reflecting deeply before definitely making up his mind. He twisted  the little roll of papers between his fingers, and seemed to be in doubt  whether to open it and give it to Madame Rapally to read or not. In the  end, however, he put it in his pocket, rose, and approaching his cousin,  said--    \"I beg your pardon, this news completely changes my opinion. From the  moment Maitre Quennebert becomes your husband I shall not have a word to  say against him. My suspicions were unjust, I confess it frankly, and I  hope that in consideration of the motives which prompted me you will  forget the warmth of my attacks. I shall make no protestations, but  shall let the future show how sincere is my devotion to your interests.\"    Madame Rapally was too happy, too certain of being loved, not to pardon  easily. With the self-complacency and factitious generosity of a woman  who feels herself the object of two violent passions, she was so good as  to feel pity for the lover who was left out in the cold, and offered him  her hand. Trumeau kissed it with every outward mark of respect, while  his lips curled unseen in a smite of mockery. The cousins parted,  apparently the best of friends, and on the understanding that Trumeau  would be present at the nuptial benediction, which was to be given in a  church beyond the town hall, near the house in which the newly-married  couple were to live; the house on the Pont Saint-Michel having lately  been sold to great advantage.    \"On my word,\" said Trumeau, as he went off, \"it would have been a great  mistake to have spoken. I have got that wretch of a Quennebert into my  clutches at last; and there is nobody but himself to blame. He is taking  the plunge of his own free will, there is no need for me to shove him  off the precipice.\"    The ceremony took place next day. Quennebert conducted his interesting  bride to the altar, she hung with ornaments like the shrine of a saint,  and, beaming all over with smiles, looked so ridiculous that the  handsome bridegroom reddened to the roots of his hair with shame. Just  as they entered the church, a coffin, on which lay a sword, and which  was followed by a single mourner, who from his manners and dress seemed  to belong to the class of nobles, was carried in by the same door. The  wedding guests drew back to let the funeral pass on, the living giving  precedence to the dead. The solitary mourner glanced by chance at  Quennebert, and started as if the sight of him was painful.    \"What an unlucky meeting!\" murmured Madame Rapally; \"it is sure to be a  bad omen.\"    \"It's sure to be the exact opposite,\" said Quennebert smiling.    The two ceremonies took place simultaneously in two adjoining chapels;  the funeral dirges which fell on the widow's ear full of sinister  prediction seemed to have quite another meaning for Quennebert, for his  features lost their look of care, his wrinkles smoothed themselves out,  till the guests, among whom was Trumeau, who did not suspect the secret  of his relief from suspense, began to believe, despite their surprise,  that he was really rejoiced at obtaining legal possession of the  charming Madame Rapally.    As for her, she fleeted the daylight hours by anticipating the joyful  moment when she would have her husband all to herself. When night came,  hardly had she entered the nuptial chamber than she uttered a piercing  shriek. She had just found and read a paper left on the bed by Trumeau,  who before leaving had contrived to glide into the room unseen. Its  contents were of terrible import, so terrible that the new-made wife  fell unconscious to the ground.    Quennebert, who, without a smile, was absorbed in reflections on the  happiness at last within his grasp, heard the noise from the next room,  and rushing in, picked up his wife. Catching sight of the paper, he also  uttered a cry of anger and astonishment, but in whatever circumstances  he found himself he was never long uncertain how to act. Placing Madame  Quennebert, still unconscious, on the bed, he called her maid, and,  having impressed on her that she was to take every care of her mistress,  and above all to tell her from him as soon as she came to herself that  there was no cause for alarm, he left the house at once. An hour later,  in spite of the efforts of the servants, he forced his way into the  presence of Commander de Jars. Holding out the fateful document to him,  he said:    \"Speak openly, commander! Is it you who in revenge for your long  constraint have done this? I can hardly think so, for after what has  happened you know that I have nothing to fear any longer. Still, knowing  my secret and unable to do it in any other way, have you perchance taken  your revenge by an attempt to destroy my future happiness by sowing  dissension and disunion between me and my wife?\"    The commander solemnly assured him that he had had no hand in bringing  about the discovery.    'Then if it's not you, it must be a worthless being called Trumeau, who,  with the unerring instinct of jealousy, has run the truth to earth. But  he knows only half: I have never been either so much in love or so  stupid as to allow myself to be trapped. I have given you my promise to  be discreet and not to misuse my power, and as long as was compatible  with my own safety I have kept my word. But now you must see that I am  bound to defend myself, and to do that I shall be obliged to summon you  as a witness. So leave Paris tonight and seek out some safe retreat  where no one can find you, for to-morrow I shall speak. Of course if I  am quit for a woman's tears, if no more difficult task lies before me  than to soothe a weeping wife, you can return immediately; but if, as is  too probable, the blow has been struck by the hand of a rival furious at  having been defeated, the matter will not so easily be cut short; the  arm of the law will be invoked, and then I must get my head out of the  noose which some fingers I know of are itching to draw tight.\"    \"You are quite right, sir,\" answered the commander; \"I fear that my  influence at court is not strong enough to enable me to brave the matter  out. Well, my success has cost me dear, but it has cured me for ever of  seeking out similar adventures. My preparations will not take long, and  to-morrow's dawn will find me far from Paris.\"    Quennebert bowed and withdrew, returning home to console his Ariadne.          CHAPTER IX      The accusation hanging over the head of Maitre Quennebert was a very  serious one, threatening his life, if proved. But he was not uneasy; he  knew himself in possession of facts which would enable him to refute it  triumphantly.    The platonic love of Angelique de Guerchi for the handsome Chevalier de  Moranges had resulted, as we have seen, in no practical wrong to the Duc  de Vitry. After her reconciliation with her lover, brought about by the  eminently satisfactory explanations she was able to give of her conduct,  which we have already laid before our readers, she did not consider it  advisable to shut her heart to his pleadings much longer, and the  consequence was that at the end of a year she found herself in a  condition which it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#13)"],[1," defended himself  with more than human strength, and with dreadful cries got free from his  murderers, his face all bloody, his fair hair pulled out in handfuls.  The unhappy young man tried to gain his own bedroom, so as to get some  weapon and valiantly resist the assassins; but as he reached the door,  Nicholas of Melazzo, putting his dagger like a bolt into the lock,  stopped his entrance. The prince, calling aloud the whole time and  imploring the protection of his friends, returned to the hall; but all  the doors were shut, and no one held out a helping hand; for the queen  was silent, showing no uneasiness about her husband's death.    But the nurse Isolda, terrified by the shouting of her beloved son and  lord, leapt from her bed and went to the window, filling the house with  dreadful cries. The traitors, alarmed by the mighty uproar, although the  place was lonely and so far from the centre of the town that nobody  could have come to see what the noise was, were on the point of letting  their victim go, when Bertrand of Artois, who felt he was more guilty  than the others, seized the prince with hellish fury round the waist,  and after a desperate struggle got him down; then dragging him by the  hair of his head to a balcony which gave upon the garden, and pressing  one knee upon his chest, cried out to the others--    \"Come here, barons: I have what we want to strangle him with.\"    And round his neck he passed a long cord of silk and gold, while the  wretched man struggled all he could. Bertrand quickly drew up the knot,  and the others threw the body over the parapet of the balcony, leaving  it hanging between earth and sky until death ensued. When the Count of  Terlizzi averted his eyes from the horrid spectacle, Robert of Cabane  cried out imperiously--    \"What are you doing there? The cord is long enough for us all to hold:  we want not witnesses, we want accomplices!\"    As soon as the last convulsive movements of the dying man had ceased,  they let the corpse drop the whole height of the three storeys, and  opening the doors of the hall, departed as though nothing had happened.    Isolda, when at last she contrived to get a light, rapidly ran to the  queen's chamber, and finding the door shut on the inside, began to call  loudly on her Andre. There was no answer, though the queen was in the  room. The poor nurse, distracted, trembling, desperate, ran down all the  corridors, knocked at all the cells and woke the monks one by one,  begging them to help her look for the prince. The monks said that they  had indeed heard a noise, but thinking it was a quarrel between soldiers  drunken perhaps or mutinous, they had not thought it their business to  interfere. Isolda eagerly, entreated: the alarm spread through the  convent; the monks followed the nurse, who went on before with a torch.  She entered the garden, saw something white upon the grass, advanced  trembling, gave one piercing cry, and fell backward.    The wretched Andre was lying in his blood, a cord round his neck as  though he were a thief, his head crushed in by the height from which he  fell. Then two monks went upstairs to the queen's room, and respectfully  knocking at the door, asked in sepulchral tones--    \"Madam, what would you have us do with your husband's corpse?\"    And when the queen made no answer, they went down again slowly to the  garden, and kneeling one at the head, the other at the foot of the dead  man, they began to recite penitential psalms in a low voice. When they  had spent an hour in prayer, two other monks went up in the same way to  Joan's chamber, repeating the same question and getting no answer,  whereupon they relieved the first two, and began themselves to pray.  Next a third couple went to the door of this inexorable room, and coming  away perturbed by their want of success, perceived that there was a  disturbance of people outside the convent, while vengeful cries were  heard amongst the indignant crowd. The groups became more and more  thronged, threatening voices were raised, a torrent of invaders  threatened the royal dwelling, when the queen's guard appeared, lance in  readiness, and a litter closely shut, surrounded by the principal barons  of the court, passed through the crowd, which stood stupidly gazing.  Joan, wrapped in a black veil, went back to Castel Nuovo, amid her  escort; and nobody, say the historians, had the courage to say a word  about this terrible deed.          CHAPTER V      The terrible part that Charles of Durazzo was to play began as soon as  this crime was accomplished. The duke left the corpse two whole days  exposed to the wind and the rain, unburied and dishonoured, the corpse  of a man whom the pope had made King of Sicily and Jerusalem, so that  the indignation of the mob might be increased by the dreadful sight. On  the third he ordered it to be conveyed with the utmost pomp to the  cathedral of Naples, and assembling all the Hungarians around the  catafalque, he thus addressed them, in a voice of thunder:--    \"Nobles and commoners, behold our king hanged like a dog by infamous  traitors. God will soon make known to us the names of all the guilty:  let those who desire that justice may be done hold up their hands and  swear against murderers bloody persecution, implacable hatred,  everlasting vengeance.\"    It was this one man's cry that brought death and desolation to the  murderers' hearts, and the people dispersed about the town, shrieking,  \"Vengeance, vengeance!\"    Divine justice, which knows naught of privilege and respects no crown,  struck Joan first of all in her love. When the two lovers first met,  both were seized alike with terror and disgust; they recoiled trembling,  the queen seeing in Bertrand her husband's executioner, and he in her  the cause of his crime, possibly of his speedy punishment. Bertrand's  looks were disordered, his cheeks hollow, his eyes encircled with black  rings, his mouth horribly distorted; his arm and forefinger extended  towards his accomplice, he seemed to behold a frightful vision rising  before him. The same cord he had used when he strangled Andre, he now  saw round the queen's neck, so tight that it made its way into her  flesh: an invisible force, a Satanic impulse, urged him to strangle with  his own hands the woman he had loved so dearly, had at one time adored  on his knees. The count rushed out of the room with gestures of  desperation, muttering incoherent words; and as he shewed plain signs of  mental aberration, his father, Charles of Artois, took him away, and  they went that same evening to their palace of St. Agatha, and there  prepared a defence in case they should be attacked.    But Joan's punishment, which was destined to be slow as well as  dreadful, to last thirty-seven years and end in a ghastly death, was now  only beginning. All the wretched beings who were stained with Andre's  death came in turn to her to demand the price of blood. The Catanese and  her son, who held in their hands not only the queen's honour but her  life, now became doubly greedy and exacting. Dona Cancha no longer put  any bridle on her licentiousness, and the Empress of Constantinople  ordered her niece to marry her eldest son, Robert, Prince of Tarentum.  Joan, consumed by remorse, full of indignation and shame at the arrogant  conduct of her subjects, dared scarcely lift her head, and stooped to  entreaties, only stipulating for a few days' delay before giving her  answer: the empress consented, on condition that her son should come to  reside at Castel Nuovo, with permission to see the queen once a day.  Joan bowed her head in silence, and Robert of Tarentum was installed at  the castle.    Charles of Durazzo, who by the death of Andre had practically become the  head of the family, and, would, by the terms of his grandfather's will,  inherit the kingdom by right of his wife Marie in the case of Joan's  dying without lawful issue, sent to the queen two commands: first, that  she should not dream of contracting a new marriage without first  consulting him in the choice of a husband; secondly, that she should  invest him at once with the title of Duke of Calabria. To compel his  cousin to make these two concessions, he added that if she should be so  ill advised as to refuse either of them, he should hand over to justice  the proofs of the crime and the names of the murderers. Joan, bending  beneath the weight of this new difficulty, could think of no way to  avoid it; but Catherine, who alone was stout enough to fight this nephew  of hers, insisted that they must strike at the Duke of Durazzo in his  ambition and hopes, and tell him, to begin with--what was the fact--that  the queen was pregnant. If, in spite of this news, he persisted in his  plans, she would find some means or other, she said, of causing trouble  and discord in her nephew's family, and wounding him in his most  intimate affections or closest interests, by publicly dishonouring him  through his wife or his mother.    Charles smiled coldly when his aunt came to tell him from the queen that  she was about to bring into the world an infant, Andre's posthumous  child. What importance could a babe yet unborn possibly have--as a fact,  it lived only a few months--in the eyes of a man who with such admirable  coolness got rid of people who stood in his wary, and that moreover by  the hand of his own enemies? He told the empress that the happy news she  had condescended to bring him in person, far from diminishing his  kindness towards his cousin, inspired him rather with more interest and  goodwill; that consequently he reiterated his suggestion, and renewed  his promise not to seek vengeance for his dear Andre, since in a certain  sense the crime was not complete should a child be destined to survive;  but in case of a refusal he declared himself inexorable. He cleverly  gave Catherine to understand that, as she had some interest herself in  the prince's"]]]
