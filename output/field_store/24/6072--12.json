[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28458"],[0,"What a Young Woman Ought to Know (#13)"],[1," are much alike in their  inclinations. They both love activity--to run, to climb, to shout, to  laugh, to play. If left to themselves one sees not much more  difference between boys and girls than between different individuals  of the same sex. But as they grow and develop they begin to take on  characteristics that indicate the evolution of sex.    The boy grows rapidly in height, his voice breaks, the signs of a  moustache appear, he seems constrained and embarrassed in society, and  yet he begins to show more politeness towards women and more of an  inclination to be gallant to girls. He is becoming a man, and assumes  manlike airs. Often, too, he becomes restless and willful, hard to  govern, self-assertive, with an assumption of wisdom that provokes  laughter from his elders. The boy is passing through a serious crisis  and needs much wise and loving care. There are inner forces awakening  that move him strangely; he does not understand himself, neither do  his friends seem to understand him. Sometimes they snub and nag him,  sometimes they tease and make fun of him. In either case he does not  find home a happy place, and frequently leaves it to seek more  sympathetic companionship elsewhere.    I once spoke to an audience of women and girls along this line, and  appealed to the mothers and sisters to be kind to the boys in their  homes who were between twelve and eighteen years of age, to remember  that they were passing through the critical period of transition from  boyhood to manhood, and to try and help them by sympathy and kindness.  Some time later, as I was on the train, a young lady came and sat down  by me and said: \"I want to thank you for what you said to us the other  day about boys. I have a brother about sixteen, and we have done just  as you said; we have teased him about his moustache, and his voice,  and his awkwardness, and laughed the more because it seemed to touch  him. He had gotten so that he never would do anything for us girls,  and we called him an old bear. Since I heard you I concluded that we  had done wrong and I would make a change, so that evening I said  kindly, 'Charlie, don't you want me to tie your cravat? I'd like to,  ever so much.' I shall never forget the surprised look he gave me. It  seemed as if he could not believe that I, his sister, wanted to do  something to please him, but as soon as he saw I really meant it he  accepted my offer with thanks, and since then it seems as if he could  not do enough for me. Really I have almost cried to think that so  little a thing would make him so grateful. I have invited him to go  out with me several times, and he seems so glad to go. Then I've begun  to make things for his room--little fancy things that I never thought  a boy would care for--and he has appreciated them so much. Why, he  even stays in his room sometimes, now, instead of going off with the  boys. And the other day, when one of the boys came to see him, I heard  him say, 'Come up and see my room,' and the other boy said, 'Well, I  wish some one would fix up _my_ room in such a jolly fashion.'  Really,\" said the girl, \"if you have done nothing on your trip but  what you have done for me, in showing me how to be good to my brother,  it has paid for you to come.\"    I often think of this little incident when I see boys at this critical  age who are snubbed and teased just because they are leaving the land  of boyhood to begin the difficult climb up the slopes of early manhood  towards the grander height of maturity; and I wish all parents,  sisters and older brothers would manifest a sympathy with the boy who,  swayed by inner forces and influenced by outward temptation, is in a  place of great danger.    The girl at this period is also passing through a crisis, but this  fact is better understood by her friends than is the crisis of the  boy's life. Her parents are anxious that she shall pass the crisis  safely, and they have more patience with her eccentricities. She, too,  often shows nervousness, irritability, petulance, or willfulness. She  has headaches and backaches, she manifests lassitude and weariness,  and is, perhaps, quite changed from her former self. She weeps easily  or over nothing at all. She is dissatisfied with herself and the whole  world. She feels certain vague, romantic longings that she could not  explain if she tried. She inclines toward the reading of sensational  love stories, and if not well instructed and self-respecting may be  easily led into flirtations or conduct that later in life may make her  blush to remember. Certain physical changes begin to be manifest. She  increases rapidly in height, her figure grows fuller and more rounded,  her breasts are often sore and tender. Hair makes its appearance on  the body, and altogether she seems to be blossoming out into a fuller  and riper beauty. She is changing from the girl to the woman, and this  is a matter of sex. At this time the organs of sex, which have been  dormant, awaken and take on their activity, and it is this awakening  which is making itself felt throughout her whole organization.    We are sometimes apt to think that sex is located in certain organs  only, but in truth sex, while centralized in the reproductive organs,  makes itself manifest throughout the whole organization. I used to  feel somewhat indignant when I heard people talk of sex in mind, and I  boldly asserted that it did not exist, that intellect was neuter and  had no reference to sex; but I do not feel so now. When I see what an  influence the awakening of sex has upon the entire body and upon the  character, I am led to believe that sex inheres in mind as well. That  does not mean that the brain of one sex is either inferior or superior  to the other; it means only that they differ; that men and women see  things from different standpoints; that they are the two eyes of the  race, and the use of both is needed to a clear understanding of any  problem of human interest.    You know that the true perspective of objects cannot be had with one  eye only, for each eye has its own range of vision, and one eye can  see much farther on one side of an object than the other can. You can  try this for yourself.    If, then, in viewing the vital problems of life we have the man's view  only or the woman's view only, we have not the true perspective. We  cannot say that either has superior powers of vision, but we can say  that they differ, as this difference is inherent in them as men and  women, and not merely as individuals.    Instead, then, of looking at sex as circumscribed, and perhaps as  something low and vulgar, to be thought of and spoken of only with  whispers or questionable mirth, we should see that sex is God's  divinest gift to humanity, the power through which we come into the  nearest likeness to Himself--the function by which we become creators  and transmitters of our powers of body, mind, and soul.    It is important that a young woman should understand her own structure  and the functions of all her organs, and so, with this feeling of  reverence for sex, we will begin this study.    The trunk of the body is divided into three cavities; the upper or  thoracic cavity contains the heart and lungs; the central or abdominal  cavity contains the organs of nutrition, the stomach, liver, bowels,  etc.; the lower or pelvic cavity contains two organs of elimination,  the bladder and the rectum, and also the organs of reproduction, or of  sex. Between the outlet of bladder and bowels is the inlet to the  reproductive organs. This inlet is a narrow channel called the vagina,  and is about six inches in length. At the upper end is the mouth of  the womb or uterus. The words mean the same, but womb is Anglo-Saxon  and _uterus_ is Latin, and as Latin is the language of science, we  will use that word. The uterus is the little nest or room in which the  unborn baby has to live for three-fourths of a year. It is a small  organ, about the size and shape of a small flattened pear. It is  suspended with the small end downwards, and it is hollow. It is held  in place by broad ligaments that extend outward to the sides, and by  short, round ligaments from front to back. These ligaments do not hold  it firmly in place, for it is necessary that it should be able to rise  out of the pelvic into the abdominal cavity during pregnancy, as the  baby grows too large to be contained in the small pelvic space.    On the posterior sides of the two broad ligaments are two small oval  organs which are called ovaries, meaning the place of the eggs.          CHAPTER XIV.    BECOMING A WOMAN.      Perhaps you will remember that I once told you that all life is from  an egg, the life of the plant, the fish, the bird, the human being. In  the book \"What a Young Girl Ought to Know\" we discussed how all life  originates in an egg, and why there must needs be fathers as well as  mothers. We found that some eggs were small, were laid by the mothers  in various places, and then left to develop or to die. Others were  larger, covered with a large shell, and kept warm by the mothers  sitting over them until the little ones were hatched. Others were so  small that they developed in the mother's body until, as living  creatures, they were born into the world. This is the case with the  human being. He is first an egg in the mother's ovary. When this egg  has reached a certain stage of development it passes from the ovary  through a tube into the uterus. If it meets there, or on its way  there, the fertilizing principle of the male, it remains there and  develops into the child. If it does not meet this principle, it passes  out through the vagina and is lost.    But the eggs, or ova--which is the Latin word meaning eggs--do not  begin to ripen until the girl reaches the age of thirteen or fourteen,  or, in other words, until she begins to become a woman. This passing  away of the ovum (singular of ova) is called ovulation, and it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2846"],[0,"The Life of Flavius Josephus (#13)"],[1,"to come, but did not send word when he would come: and when I had  learned so much, I took the soldiers that were with me, and made an  assault upon the people of Sepphoris, and took the city by force. The  Galileans took this opportunity, as thinking they had now a proper time  for showing their hatred to them, since they bore ill-will to that city  also. They then exerted themselves, as if they would destroy them all  utterly, with those that sojourned there also. So they ran upon them,  and set their houses on fire, as finding them without inhabitants; for  the men, out of fear, ran together to the citadel. So the Galileans  carried off every thing, and omitted no kind of desolation which they  could bring upon their countrymen. When I saw this, I was exceedingly  troubled at it, and commanded them to leave off, and put them in  mind that it was not agreeable to piety to do such things to their  countrymen: but since they neither would hearken to what I exhorted, nor  to what I commanded them to do, [for the hatred they bore to the  people there was too hard for my exhortations to them,] I bade those  my friends, who were most faithful to me, and were about me, to give on  reports, as if the Romans were falling upon the other part of the city  with a great army; and this I did, that, by such a report being spread  abroad, I might restrain the violence of the Galileans, and preserve  the city of Sepphoris. And at length this stratagem had its effect; for,  upon hearing this report, they were in fear for themselves, and so they  left off plundering and ran away; and this more especially, because they  saw me, their general, do the same also; for, that I might cause this  report to be believed, I pretended to be in fear as well as they.  Thus were the inhabitants of Sepphoris unexpectedly preserved by this  contrivance of mine.    68. Nay, indeed, Tiberias had like to have been plundered by the  Galileans also upon the following occasion:-- The chief men of the  senate wrote to the king, and desired that he would come to them, and  take possession of their city. The king promised to come, and wrote a  letter in answer to theirs, and gave it to one of his bed-chamber, whose  name was Crispus, and who was by birth a Jew, to carry it to Tiberias.  When the Galileans knew that this man carried such a letter, they caught  him, and brought him to me; but as soon as the whole multitude heard of  it, they were enraged, and betook themselves to their arms. So a great  many of them together from all quarters the next day, and came to the  city Asochis, where I then lodged, and made heavy clamors, and called  the city of Tiberias a traitor to them, and a friend to the king; and  desired leave of me to go down and utterly destroy it; for they bore  the like ill-will to the people of Tiberias, as they did to those of  Sepphoris.    69. When I heard this, I was in doubt what to do, and hesitated by what  means I might deliver Tiberias from the rage of the Galileans; for  I could not deny that those of Tiborias had written to the king, and  invited him to come to them; for his letters to them, in answer thereto,  would fully prove the truth of that. So I sat a long time musing with  myself, and then said to them, \"I know well enough that the people of  Tiberias have offended; nor shall I forbid you to plunder the city.  However, such things ought to be done with discretion; for they of  Tiberias have not been the only betrayers of our liberty, but many of  the most eminent patriots of the Galileans, as they pretended to be,  have done the same. Tarry therefore till I shall thoroughly find out  those authors of our danger, and then you shall have them all at once  under your power, with all such as you shall yourselves bring in also.\"  Upon my saying this, I pacifie the multitude, and they left off their  anger, and went their ways; and I gave orders that he who brought the  king's letters should be put into bonds; but in a few days I pretended  that I was obliged, by a necessary affair of my own, to out of the  kingdom. I then called Crispus privately, and ordered him to make  the soldier that kept him drunk, and to run away to the king. So when  Tiberias was in danger of being utterly destroyed a second time, it  escaped the danger by my skillful management, and the care that I had  for its preservation.    70. About this time it was that Justus, the son of Pistus, without  my knowledge, ran away to the king; the occasion of which I will here  relate. Upon the beginning of the war between the Jews and Romans, the  people of Tiberias resolved to submit to the king, and not to revolt  from the Romans; while Justus tried to persuade them to betake  themselves to their arms, as being himself desirous of innovations, and  having hopes of obtaining the government of Galilee, as well as of his  own country [Tiberias] also. Yet did he not obtain what he hoped for,  because the Galileans bore ill-will to those of Tiberias, and this on  account of their anger at what miseries they had suffered from them  before the war; thence it was that they would not endure that Justus  should be their governor. I myself also, who had been intrusted by the  community of Jerusalem with the government of Galilee, did frequently  come to that degree of rage at Justus, that I had almost resolved  to kill him, as not able to bear his mischievous disposition. He was  therefore much afraid of me, lest at length my passion should come to  extremity; so he went to the king, as supposing that he would dwell  better and more safely with him.    71. Now, when the people of Sepphoris had, in so surprising a manner,  escaped their first danger, they sent to Cestius Gallus, and desired him  to come to them immediately, and take possession of their city, or else  to send forces sufficient to repress all their enemies' incursions  upon them; and at the last they did prevail with Gallus to send them a  considerable army, both of horse and foot, which came in the night time,  and which they admitted into the city. But when the country round about  it was harassed by the Roman army, I took those soldiers that were about  me, and came to Garisme, where I cast up a bank, a good way off the city  Sepphoris; and when I was at twenty furlongs distance, I came upon it by  night, and made an assault upon its walls with my forces; and when I had  ordered a considerable number of my soldiers to scale them with ladders,  I became master of the greatest part of the city. But soon after, our  unacquaintedness with the places forced us to retire, after we had  killed twelve of the Roman footmen, and two horsemen, and a few of the  people of Sepphoris, with the loss of only a single man of our own. And  when it afterwards came to a battle in the plain against the horsemen,  and we had undergone the dangers of it courageously for a long time, we  were beaten; for upon the Romans encompassing me about, my soldiers were  afraid, and fell back. There fell in that battle one of those that had  been intrusted to guard my body; his name was Justus, who at this  time had the same post with the king. At the same time also there  came forces, both horsemen and footmen, from the king, and Sylla their  commander, who was the captain of his guard: this Sylla pitched his camp  at five furlongs' distance from Julias, and set a guard upon the roads,  both that which led to Cana, and that which led to the fortress Gamala,  that he might hinder their inhabitants from getting provisions out of  Galilee.    72. As soon as I had gotten intelligence of this, I sent two thousand  armed men, and a captain over them, whose name was Jeremiah, who raised  a bank a furlong off Julias, near to the river Jordan, and did no  more than skirmish with the enemy; till I took three thousand soldiers  myself, and came to them. But on the next day, when I had laid an ambush  in a certain valley, not far from the banks, I provoked those that  belonged to the king to come to a battle, and gave orders to my own  soldiers to turn their backs upon them, until they should have drawn the  enemy away from their camp, and brought them out into the field, which  was done accordingly; for Sylla, supposing that our party did really  run away, was ready to pursue them, when our soldiers that lay in ambush  took them on their backs, and put them all into great disorder. I also  immediately made a sudden turn with my own forces, and met those of the  king's party, and put them to flight. And I had performed great things  that day, if a certain fate had not been my hinderance; for the horse  on which I rode, and upon whose back I fought, fell into a quagmire, and  threw me on the ground, and I was bruised on my wrist, and carried into  a village named Cepharnome, or Capernaum. When my soldiers heard of  this, they were afraid I had been worse hurt than I was; and so they  did not go on with their pursuit any further, but returned in very great  concern for me. I therefore sent for the physicians, and while I was  under their hands, I continued feverish that day; and as the physicians  directed, I was that night removed to Taricheee.    73. When Sylla and his party were informed what happened to me, they  took courage again; and understanding that the watch was negligently  kept in our camp, they by night placed a body of horsemen in ambush  beyond Jordan, and when it was day they provoked us to fight; and as we  did not refuse it, but came into the plain, their horsemen appeared out  of that ambush in which they had lain, and put our men into disorder,  and made them run away; so they slew six men of our side. Yet did they  not go off with the victory at last; for when they heard that some armed  men were sailed from Taricheae to Juli, they were afraid, and retired.    74. It was not now long before Vespasian came to Tyre, and king Agrippa  with him; but the Tyrians began to speak reproachfully of the king,  and called him an"]]]
