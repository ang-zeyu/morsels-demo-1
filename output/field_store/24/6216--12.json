To obtain the Mouse I place my  friends and neighbours under requisition; they laugh at my whim but  none the less proffer their traps. Yet, the moment a Mouse is needed,  that very common animal becomes rare. Braving decorum in his speech,  which follows the Latin of his ancestors, the Provencal says, but even  more crudely than in my translation: \"If you look for dung, the Asses  become constipated!\"    At last I possess the Mouse of my dreams! She comes to me from that  refuge, furnished with a truss of straw, in which official charity  gives the hospitality of a day to the beggar wandering over the face of  the fertile earth; from that municipal hostel whence one invariably  emerges verminous. O Reaumur, who used to invite marquises to see your  caterpillars change their skins, what would you have said of a future  disciple conversant with such wretchedness as this? Perhaps it is well  that we should not be ignorant of it, so that we may take compassion on  the sufferings of beasts.    The Mouse so greatly desired is mine. I place her upon the centre of  the brick. The grave-diggers under the wire cover are now seven in  number, of whom three are females. All have gone to earth: some are  inactive, close to the surface; the rest are busy in their crypts. The  presence of the fresh corpse is promptly perceived. About seven o'clock  in the morning, three Necrophori hurry up, two males and a female. They  slip under the Mouse, who moves in jerks, a sign of the efforts of the  burying-party. An attempt is made to dig into the layer of sand which  hides the brick, so that a bank of sand accumulates about the body.    For a couple of hours the jerks continue without results. I profit by  the circumstance to investigate the manner in which the work is  performed. The bare brick allows me to see what the excavated soil  concealed from me. If it is necessary to move the body, the Beetle  turns over; with his six claws he grips the hair of the dead animal,  props himself upon his back and pushes, making a lever of his head and  the tip of his abdomen. If digging is required, he resumes the normal  position. So, turn and turn about, the sexton strives, now with his  claws in the air, when it is a question of shifting the body or  dragging it lower down; now with his feet on the ground, when it is  necessary to deepen the grave.    The point at which the Mouse lies is finally recognized as  unassailable. A male appears in the open. He explores the specimen,  goes the round of it, scratches a little at random. He goes back; and  immediately the body rocks. Is he advising his collaborators of what he  has discovered? Is he arranging matters with a view to their  establishing themselves elsewhere, on propitious soil?    The facts are far from confirming this idea. When he shakes the body,  the others imitate him and push, but without combining their efforts in  a given direction, for, after advancing a little towards the edge of  the brick, the burden goes back again, returning to the point of  departure. In the absence of any concerted understanding, their efforts  of leverage are wasted. Nearly three hours are occupied by oscillations  which mutually annul one another. The Mouse does not cross the little  sand-hill heaped about it by the rakes of the workers.    For the second time a male emerges and makes a round of exploration. A  bore is made in workable earth, close beside the brick. This is a trial  excavation, to reveal the nature of the soil; a narrow well, of no  great depth, into which the insect plunges to half its length. The  well-sinker returns to the other workers, who arch their backs, and the  load progresses a finger's-breadth towards the point recognized as  favourable. Have they done the trick this time? No, for after a while  the Mouse recoils. No progress towards a solution of the difficulty.    Now two males come out in search of information, each of his own  accord. Instead of stopping at the point already sounded, a point most  judiciously chosen, it seemed, on account of its proximity, which would  save laborious transportation, they precipitately scour the whole area  of the cage, sounding the soil on this side and on that and ploughing  superficial furrows in it. They get as far from the brick as the limits  of the enclosure permit.    They dig, by preference, against the base of the cover; here they make  several borings, without any reason, so far as I can see, the bed of  soil being everywhere equally assailable away from the brick; the first  point sounded is abandoned for a second, which is rejected in its turn.  A third and a fourth are tried; then another and yet another. At the  sixth point the selection is made. In all these cases the excavation is  by no means a grave destined to receive the Mouse, but a mere trial  boring, of inconsiderable depth, its diameter being that of the  digger's body.    A return is made to the Mouse, who suddenly quivers, oscillates,  advances, recoils, first in one direction, then in another, until in  the end the little hillock of sand is crossed. Now we are free of the  brick and on excellent soil. Little by little the load advances. This  is no cartage by a team hauling in the open, but a jerky displacement,  the work of invisible levers. The body seems to move of its own accord.    This time, after so many hesitations, their efforts are concerted; at  all events, the load reaches the region sounded far more rapidly than I  expected. Then begins the burial, according to the usual method. It is  one o'clock. The Necrophori have allowed the hour-hand of the clock to  go half round the dial while verifying the condition of the surrounding  spots and displacing the Mouse.    In this experiment it appears at the outset that the males play a major  part in the affairs of the household. Better-equipped, perhaps, than  their mates, they make investigations when a difficulty occurs; they  inspect the soil, recognize whence the check arises and choose the  point at which the grave shall be made. In the lengthy experiment of  the brick, the two males alone explored the surroundings and set to  work to solve the difficulty. Confiding in their assistance, the  female, motionless beneath the Mouse, awaited the result of their  investigations. The tests which are to follow will confirm the merits  of these valiant auxiliaries.    In the second place, the point where the Mouse lay being recognized as  presenting an insurmountable resistance, there was no grave dug in  advance, a little farther off, in the light soil. All attempts were  limited, I repeat, to shallow soundings which informed the insect of  the possibility of inhumation.    It is absolute nonsense to speak of their first preparing the grave to  which the body will afterwards be carted. To excavate the soil, our  grave-diggers must feel the weight of their dead on their backs. They  work only when stimulated by the contact of its fur. Never, never in  this world do they venture to dig a grave unless the body to be buried  already occupies the site of the cavity. This is absolutely confirmed  by my two and a half months and more of daily observations.    The rest of Clairville's anecdote bears examination no better. We are  told that the Necrophorus in difficulties goes in search of assistance  and returns with companions who assist him to bury the Mouse. This, in  another form, is the edifying story of the Sacred Beetle whose pellet  had rolled into a rut, powerless to withdraw his treasure from the  gulf, the wily Dung-beetle called together three or four of his  neighbours, who benevolently recovered the pellet, returning to their  labours after the work of salvage.    The exploit--so ill-interpreted--of the thieving pill-roller sets me on  my guard against that of the undertaker. Shall I be too exigent if I  enquire what precautions the observer adopted to recognize the owner of  the Mouse on his return, when he reappears, as we are told, with four  assistants? What sign denotes that one of the five who was able, in so  rational a manner, to appeal for help? Can one even be sure that the  one to disappear returns and forms one of the band? There is nothing to  indicate it; and this was the essential point which a sterling observer  was bound not to neglect. Were they not rather five chance Necrophori  who, guided by the smell, without any previous understanding, hastened  to the abandoned Mouse to exploit her on their own account? I incline  to this opinion, the most likely of all in the absence of exact  information.    Probability becomes certainty if we submit the case to the verification  of experiment. The test with the brick already gives us some  information. For six hours my three specimens exhausted themselves in  efforts before they got to the length of removing their booty and  placing it on practicable soil. In this long and heavy task helpful  neighbours would have been anything but unwelcome. Four other  Necrophori, buried here and there under a little sand, comrades and  acquaintances, helpers of the day before, were occupying the same cage;  and not one of those concerned thought of summoning them to give  assistance. Despite their extreme embarrassment, the owners of the  Mouse accomplished their task to the end, without the least help,  though this could have been so easily requisitioned.    Being three, one might say, they considered themselves sufficiently  strong; they needed no one else to lend them a hand. The objection does  not hold good. On many occasions and under conditions even more  difficult than those presented by a stony soil, I have again and again  seen isolated Necrophori exhausting themselves in striving against my  artifices; yet not once did they leave their work to recruit helpers.
