[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3069"],[0,"The Great Boer War (#13)"],[1,"judges see the true inner meaning of this  persistent arming, of the constant hostility, of the forming of ties  between the two republics (one of whom had been reconstituted and made  a sovereign independent State by our own act), and finally of that  intriguing which endeavoured to poison the affection and allegiance of  our own Dutch colonists, who had no political grievances whatever. They  all aimed at one end, and that end was the final expulsion of British  power from South Africa and the formation of a single great Dutch  republic. The large sum spent by the Transvaal in secret service  money--a larger sum, I believe, than that which is spent by the whole  British Empire--would give some idea of the subterranean influences at  work. An army of emissaries, agents, and spies, whatever their mission,  were certainly spread over the British colonies. Newspapers were  subsidised also, and considerable sums spent upon the press in France  and Germany.    In the very nature of things a huge conspiracy of this sort to  substitute Dutch for British rule in South Africa is not a matter which  can be easily and definitely proved. Such questions are not discussed  in public documents, and men are sounded before being taken into the  confidence of the conspirators. But there is plenty of evidence of  the individual ambition of prominent and representative men in this  direction, and it is hard to believe that what many wanted individually  was not striven for collectively, especially when we see how the course  of events did actually work towards the end which they indicated. Mr.  J.P. FitzPatrick, in 'The Transvaal from Within'--a book to which  all subsequent writers upon the subject must acknowledge their  obligations--narrates how in 1896 he was approached by Mr. D.P. Graaff,  formerly a member of the Cape Legislative Council and a very prominent  Afrikander Bondsman, with the proposition that Great Britain should be  pushed out of South Africa. The same politician made the same proposal  to Mr. Beit. Compare with this the following statement of Mr. Theodore  Schreiner, the brother of the Prime Minister of the Cape:    'I met Mr. Reitz, then a judge of the Orange Free State, in Bloemfontein  between seventeen and eighteen years ago, shortly after the retrocession  of the Transvaal, and when he was busy establishing the Afrikander Bond.  It must be patent to every one that at that time, at all events, England  and its Government had no intention of taking away the independence of  the Transvaal, for she had just \"magnanimously\" granted the same; no  intention of making war on the republics, for she had just made peace;  no intention to seize the Rand gold fields, for they were not yet  discovered. At that time, then, I met Mr. Reitz, and he did his best to  get me to become a member of his Afrikander Bond, but, after studying  its constitution and programme, I refused to do so, whereupon the  following colloquy in substance took place between us, which has been  indelibly imprinted on my mind ever since:    'REITZ: Why do you refuse? Is the object of getting the people to take  an interest in political matters not a good one?    'MYSELF: Yes, it is; but I seem to see plainly here between the lines of  this constitution much more ultimately aimed at than that.    'REITZ: What?    'MYSELF: I see quite clearly that the ultimate object aimed at is the  overthrow of the British power and the expulsion of the British flag  from South Africa.    'REITZ (with his pleasant conscious smile, as of one whose secret  thought and purpose had been discovered, and who was not altogether  displeased that such was the case): Well, what if it is so?    'MYSELF: You don't suppose, do you, that that flag is going to disappear  from South Africa without a tremendous struggle and fight?    'REITZ (with the same pleasant self-conscious, self satisfied, and yet  semi-apologetic smile): Well, I suppose not; but even so, what of that?    'MYSELF: Only this, that when that struggle takes place you and I will  be on opposite sides; and what is more, the God who was on the side of  the Transvaal in the late war, because it had right on its side will  be on the side of England, because He must view with abhorrence any  plotting and scheming to overthrow her power and position in South  Africa, which have been ordained by Him.    'REITZ: We'll see.    'Thus the conversation ended, but during the seventeen years that have  elapsed I have watched the propaganda for the overthrow of British power  in South Africa being ceaselessly spread by every possible means--the  press, the pulpit, the platform, the schools, the colleges, the  Legislature--until it has culminated in the present war, of which Mr.  Reitz and his co-workers are the origin and the cause. Believe me, the  day on which F.W. Reitz sat down to pen his ultimatum to Great Britain  was the proudest and happiest moment of his life, and one which had  for long years been looked forward to by him with eager longing and  expectation.'    Compare with these utterances of a Dutch politician of the Cape, and of  a Dutch politician of the Orange Free State, the following passage from  a speech delivered by Kruger at Bloemfontein in the year 1887:    'I think it too soon to speak of a United South Africa under one flag.  Which flag was it to be? The Queen of England would object to having  her flag hauled down, and we, the burghers of the Transvaal, object to  hauling ours down. What is to be done? We are now small and of little  importance, but we are growing, and are preparing the way to take our  place among the great nations of the world.'    'The dream of our life,' said another, 'is a union of the States of  South Africa, and this has to come from within, not from without. When  that is accomplished, South Africa will be great.'    Always the same theory from all quarters of Dutch thought, to be  followed by many signs that the idea was being prepared for in practice.  I repeat that the fairest and most unbiased historian cannot dismiss the  conspiracy as a myth.    And to this one may retort, why should they not conspire? Why should  they not have their own views as to the future of South Africa? Why  should they not endeavour to have one universal flag and one common  speech? Why should they not win over our colonists, if they can, and  push us into the sea? I see no reason why they should not. Let them try  if they will. And let us try to prevent them. But let us have an end  of talk about British aggression, of capitalist designs upon the gold  fields, of the wrongs of a pastoral people, and all the other veils  which have been used to cover the issue. Let those who talk about  British designs upon the republics turn their attention for a moment to  the evidence which there is for republican designs upon the colonies.  Let them reflect that in the one system all white men are equal, and  that on the other the minority of one race has persecuted the majority  of the other, and let them consider under which the truest freedom lies,  which stands for universal liberty and which for reaction and racial  hatred. Let them ponder and answer all this before they determine where  their sympathies lie.    Leaving these wider questions of politics, and dismissing for the  time those military considerations which were soon to be of such vital  moment, we may now return to the course of events in the diplomatic  struggle between the Government of the Transvaal and the Colonial  Office. On September 8th, as already narrated, a final message was sent  to Pretoria, which stated the minimum terms which the British Government  could accept as being a fair concession to her subjects in the  Transvaal. A definite answer was demanded, and the nation waited with  sombre patience for the reply.    There were few illusions in this country as to the difficulties of  a Transvaal war. It was clearly seen that little honour and immense  vexation were in store for us. The first Boer war still smarted in our  minds, and we knew the prowess of the indomitable burghers. But our  people, if gloomy, were none the less resolute, for that national  instinct which is beyond the wisdom of statesmen had borne it in upon  them that this was no local quarrel, but one upon which the whole  existence of the empire hung. The cohesion of that empire was to be  tested. Men had emptied their glasses to it in time of peace. Was it a  meaningless pouring of wine, or were they ready to pour their  hearts' blood also in time of war? Had we really founded a series of  disconnected nations, with no common sentiment or interest, or was  the empire an organic whole, as ready to thrill with one emotion or to  harden into one resolve as are the several States of the Union? That was  the question at issue, and much of the future history of the world was  at stake upon the answer.    Already there were indications that the colonies appreciated the fact  that the contention was no affair of the mother country alone, but that  she was upholding the rights of the empire as a whole, and might fairly  look to them to support her in any quarrel which might arise from it. As  early as July 11th, Queensland, the fiery and semitropical, had offered  a contingent of mounted infantry with machine guns; New Zealand, Western  Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia  followed in the order named. Canada, with the strong but more deliberate  spirit of the north, was the last to speak, but spoke the more firmly  for the delay. Her citizens were the least concerned of any, for  Australians were many in South Africa but Canadians few. None the less,  she cheerfully took her share of the common burden, and grew the readier  and the cheerier as that burden came to weigh more heavily.

Blake examined them curiously while he listened at the  silent receiver.    \"Maricopa\"--the message, whatever it was, was meant for them, but there  were only parts of words and disjointed phrases that the man had written  down--\"Venus attacking Earth ... Captain Blake ... Sykes and....\"    At the name of Sykes, Blake dropped the paper.    \"What does this mean?\" he demanded. \"Sykes!--why Sykes was the  astronomer who was captured with McGuire!\"    \"Listen! Listen!\" The colonel's voice was almost shrill with excitement.    The night was whispering faintly the merest echo of a signal from a  station far away, but it resolved itself into broken fragments of sound  that were long and short in duration, and the fragments joined to form  letters in the Morse code.    \"See Winslow,\" it told them, and repeated the message: \"See Winslow at  Sierra....\" Some distant storm crashed and rattled for breathless  minutes. \"Blake see Winslow. This is McGuire, Blake. Winslow can  help--\"    The message ended abruptly. One long, wailing note; then again the night  was voiceless ... and in the radio room at Maricopa Flying Field two men  stood speechless, unbreathing, to stare at each other with incredulous  eyes, as might men who had seen a phantom--a ghost that spoke to them  and called them by name.    \"McGuire--is--alive!\" stammered Blake. \"They've taken him--there!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Colonel Boynton was considering, weighing all the possibilities, and his  voice, when he answered, had the ring of conviction.    \"That was no hoax,\" he agreed; \"that quavering tone could never be  faked. That message was sent from the same station we heard before. Yes,  McGuire is alive--or was up to the end of that sending.... But, who the  devil is Winslow?\"    Blake shook his head despairingly. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"And it  seems as if I should--\"    It was hours later, far into the night, when he sprang from out of a  half-conscious doze to find himself in the middle of the floor with the  voice of McGuire ringing clearly in his ears. A buried memory had  returned to the level of his conscious mind. He rushed over to the  colonel's quarters.    \"I've got it,\" he shouted to that officer whose head was projecting from  an upper window. \"I remember! McGuire told me about this Winslow--some  hermit that he ran across. He has some invention--some machine--said he  had been to the moon. I always thought Mac half believed him. We'll go  over Mac's things and find the address.\"    \"Do you think--do you suppose--?\" began Colonel Boynton doubtfully.    \"I don't dare to think,\" Blake responded. \"God only knows if we dare  hope; but Mac--Mac's got a level head; he wouldn't send us unless he  knew! Good Lord, man!\" he exclaimed, \"Mac radioed us from Venus; is  there anything impossible after that?\"    \"Wait there,\" said Colonel Boynton; \"I'll be right down--\"      CHAPTER XII    Lieutenant McGuire awoke, as he had on other occasions, to the smell of  sickly-sweet fumes and the stifling pressure of a mask held over his  nose and mouth. He struggled to free himself, and the mask was removed.  Another of the man-creatures whom McGuire had not seen before helped him  to sit up.    A group of the attenuated figures, with their blood-and-ashes faces,  regarded him curiously. The one who had helped him arise forced the  others to stand back, and he gave McGuire a drink of yellow fluid from a  crystal goblet. The dazed man gulped it down to feel a following surge  of warmth and life that pulsed through his paralyzed body. The figures  before him came sharply from the haze that had enveloped them. A window  high above admitted a golden light that meant another day, but it  brought no cheer or encouragement to the flyer. McGuire felt crushed and  hopeless in the knowledge that his life must still go on.    If only that sleep could have continued--carried him out to the deeper  sleep of death! What hope for them here? Not a chance! And then he  remembered Sykes; he mustn't desert Sykes. He looked about him to see  the same prison room from which he and Sykes had escaped. The body of  the scientist was motionless on the hammock-bed across the room; an  occasional deep-drawn breath showed that the man still lived.    No, he must not leave Sykes, even if he had the means of death. They  would fight it through together, and perhaps--perhaps--they might yet be  of service, might find some way to avert the catastrophe that threatened  their world. Hopeless? Beyond doubt. But he must hope--and fight!    The leader had watched the light of understanding as it returned to the  flyer's eyes. He motioned now to the others, and McGuire was picked up  bodily by four of them and carried from the room.           *       *       *       *       *    McGuire's mind was alert once more; he was eager to learn what he could  of this place that was to be their prison, but he saw little. A glory of  blending colors beyond, where the golden light from without shone  through opal walls--then he found himself upon a narrow table where  straps of metal were thrown quickly about to bind him fast. He was tied  hand and foot to the table that moved forward on smooth rollers to a  waiting lift.    What next? he questioned. Not death, for they had been too careful to  keep him alive, these repulsive things that stared at him with such cold  malevolence. Then what? And McGuire found himself with unpleasant  recollections of others he had seen strapped in similar fashion to an  operating table.    The lift that he had thought would rise fell smoothly, instead, to stop  at some point far below ground where the table with its helpless burden  was rolled into a great room.    He could move his head, and McGuire turned and twisted to look at the  maze of instruments that filled the room--a super-laboratory for  experiments of which he dared not think.    \"Whoever says I'm not scared to death is a liar,\" he whispered to  himself, but he continued to look and wonder as he was wheeled before a  gleaming machine of many coils and shining, metal parts. A smooth sheet  of metal stood vertically beyond him; painted a grayish-white, he saw;  but he could not imagine its use. A throng of people, seated in the  room, turned blood-red faces toward the bound man and the metal sheet.    \"Looks as if we were about to put on a show of some kind,\" he told  himself, \"and I am cast for a leading role.\" He watched as best he could  from his bound position while a tall figure in robes of lustreless black  appeared to stand beside him.    The newcomer regarded him with a face that was devoid of all emotion.  McGuire felt the lack of the customary expression of hatred; there was  not even that; and he knew he was nothing more than a strange animal,  bound, and helpless, ready for this weird creature's experiments. The  one in black held a pencil whose tip was a tiny, brilliant light.           *       *       *       *       *    Abruptly the room plunged to darkness, where the only visible thing was  this one point of light. Ceaselessly it waved back and forth before his  eyes; he followed it in a pattern of strange design; it approached and  receded. Again and again the motion was repeated, until McGuire felt  himself sinking--sinking--into a passive state of lethargy. His muscles  relaxed; his mind was at rest; there seemed nothing in the entire  universe of being but the single point of light that drew him on and on  ... till something whispered from the far reaches of black space....    It came to him, an insistent call. It was asking about the earth--his  own world. _What of Earth's armies and their means of defense?_ Vaguely  he sensed the demand, and without conscious volition he responded. He  pictured the world he had known; how plainly he saw the wide field at  Maricopa, and the sweeping flight of a squadron of planes! _Yes--yes!  How high could they ascend?_ From one of the planes he saw the world  below; the ships were near their ceiling; this was the limit of their  climb. _And did they fight with gas? What of their deadliness?_ And  again he was seated in a plane, and he was firing tiny bullets from a  tiny gun. No. They did not use gas. _But on the ground below--what  fortifications? What means of defense?_    McGuire's mind was no longer his own; he could only respond to that  invisible questioner, that insistent demand from out of the depths where  he was floating. And yet there was something within him that protested,  that clamored at his mind and brain.    Fortifications! They must know about fortifications--anti-aircraft  guns--means for combatting aerial attack. Yes, he knew, and he must  explain--and the thing within him pounded in the back of his brain to  draw him back to himself.    He saw a battery of anti-aircraft guns in operation; the guns were  firing; shells were bursting in little plumes of smoke high in the air.  And that self within him was shouting now, hammering at him; \"You are  seeing it,\" it told him; \"it is there before you on the screen. Stop!  Stop!\"           *       *       *       *       *    And for an instant McGuire had the strange experience of witnessing his  own thoughts. Memories, mental records of past experience, were flashing  through his mind; mock battles, and the batteries were firing! And,  before him, on the metal screen, there glowed a vivid picture of the  same thing. Men were serving the guns with sure swiftness; the bursts  were high in the air--in a flash of understanding Lieutenant McGuire  knew that he was giving his country's secrets to the enemy. And in that  same instant he felt himself swept upward from the depths of that  darkness where he had drifted. He was himself again, bound and helpless  before an infernal contrivance of these devil-creatures. They had read  his thoughts; the machine beside him had projected them upon the screen  for all to see; a steady clicking might"]]]
