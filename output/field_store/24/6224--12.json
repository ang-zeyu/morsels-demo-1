[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37872"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 2, No. 1, December, 1850 (#13)"],[1,"ty-six chapters of the first book of _Froissart_. It  therefore contains only the first part of Le Bel's Chronicle:  nevertheless it is a fragment of much importance. Froissart cannot be  considered as a contemporary historian of the events recorded in his  first book, but Le Bel was connected with the greater portion of them,  and was acquainted with them either from personal knowledge or through  those who had authentic sources of information.           *       *       *       *       *    Monsieur Bastiat, the political economist, (who has shown more economy  in the matter of credit for the best ideas in his books, than in  anything else we know of,) is not dead, as in the last _International_  was stated. The _Courier and Enquirer_ correspondent says:         \"I am glad to say that the report which reached Paris from Italy,       of the death of F. Bastiat, a noted writer on political economy, is       unfounded. That gentleman is recovering his health, and it is now       believed will be able, at the opening of the session, to resume his       seat in the Assembly.\"    Since his return from Italy he has published at Paris a new edition of  his latest production, the _Harmonies Economiques_, in which he has  availed himself in so large a degree and in so discreditable a manner of  the ideas of Mr. Henry C. Carey, of New Jersey, who, since he first gave  to the public the essentials of M. Bastiat's performance, has himself,  in a volume, entitled _The Harmony of Interests_, published some three  or four months ago in Philadelphia, largely and forcibly illustrated his  just and admirable doctrines. In the _Harmonies Economiques_ M. Bastiat  seeks to prove that the interests of classes and individuals in society,  as now constituted, are harmonious, and not antagonistic as certain  schools of thinkers maintain. Commercial freedom he avers, instead of  urging society toward a state of general misery, tends constantly to the  progressive increase of the general abundance and well being. In  sustaining this proposition M. Bastiat teaches the optimism of the  socialists, and holds that injustice is not a necessary thing in human  relations, that monopoly and pauperism are only temporary, and that  things must come right at last. The powers of nature, the soil,  vegetation, gravitation, heat, electricity, chemical forces, waters,  seas, in short the globe and all the endowments with which God has  enriched it, are the common property of the entire race of man, and in  proportion as society advances this common property is more equally  distributed and enjoyed. Capital assists men in their efforts to improve  this magnificent inheritance; competition is a powerful lever with which  they set in movement and render useful the gratuitous gifts of God; the  social instinct leads them to make a continual exchange of services; and  even now, though the powers of nature enter into these services, those  who receive them pay only for the labor of their fellows, not for  natural products; and the accumulation of capital constantly diminishes  the rate of interest and enables the laborer to derive a greater return  from his toil. M. Bastiat also gives a new definition of value, which he  says is _the relation of two services exchanged_. This is all, we  believe, that he _claims_ to offer as perfectly new,--the main part of  his book appearing as a clearer exposition of the doctrine of Adam  Smith. It will be seen that the theory of the book is infinitely  superior to that of Ricardo or Malthus; it has borrowed truths from the  advanced thinkers of the age; but he would be a bold critic who should  affirm that it had not mingled far-reaching errors with them.           *       *       *       *       *    M. Romieu's book in defense of despotism, (lately published in France,)  sounds as if it had been written for the _North American Review_, but it  never could have been sent to its editor, or it would have been adopted  and published by him. It is entitled \"The Era of the Caesars,\" and its  argument is, that history, ancient and modern, and the situation of the  contemporary world, prove that force, the sword, or _Caesarism_, has  ultimately decided, and will prevail, in the affairs of the nations.  Representative assemblies, Monsieur Romieu considers ridiculous, and  mischievous, and in the end fatal: such, at least, he contends, is the  experience of France; and as for the liberty of the press, it means a  form of tyranny which destroys all other liberty. At the beginning of  the century, M. de Fontanes said what (he thinks) multitudes of the  soundest minds would reecho, \"I shall never deem myself free in a  country where freedom of the press exists.\" He would convert all  journals into mere chronicles, and have them strictly watched. Force, he  says, is the only principle, even in governments styled free. He  includes Switzerland and the United States. The condition and destinies  of France he handles with special hardihood. Caesarism is here already  desired and inaugurated--not monarchy, which requires faith in it, nor  constitutional government, which is an expedient and an illusion, but a  supreme authority capable of maintaining itself, and _commanding_  respect and submission. Mr. Walsh reviews the work in one of his letters  to the _Journal of Commerce_; and judging from Mr. Walsh's  correspondence on the recent attempts to establish free institutions in  Europe, we might suspect him of a hearty sympathy with M. Romieu, whom  he describes as an erudite, conscientious personage, formerly a prefect  of a department, and a member of the Assembly.           *       *       *       *       *    The German poet, Anastasius Gruen, has just published, at Leipzic a  collection of the _popular songs of Carinthia_, translated from the  original. Carinthia, as, perhaps, all our readers are not aware, is one  of the southerly provinces of the Austrian empire, on the borders of  Turkey; and, during all the wars of Austria with the Moslems, had to  bear the brunt of the fighting. And even after peace was concluded the  Carinthians kept up a sort of minor war on their own account, being  constantly exposed to incursions from the other side of the frontier.  Thus for centuries their country was one extended fortification, and the  whole population in constant readiness to rush to arms when the signal  fires blazed upon the hills. Then every house was a fortress, and even  the churches were surrounded with palisades and ditches, behind which  the women and children sought refuge with their movables when the alarm  came too near. From this period of constant and savage warfare the  popular songs of the country date their origin. Curious to say, many of  their heroes are borrowed from the traditions and history of neighboring  lands. Thus the Servian champion Marko figures a good deal in this  poetry, while the figure which has more importance than all the others  is a foreign and almost fabulous being, called King Mathias; wherever  this mystic personage can be laid hold of and historically identified,  he appears to be Mathias Corvin, king of Hungary. The Carinthians  attribute to him not only all the exploits of a variety of notable  characters, but also the vices of some celebrated illustrations of  immorality. Nor is his career accomplished; according to the tradition  of the southern Slavonians, King Mathias is not yet dead, but sleeps in  a grotto in the interior of Hungary, waiting for the hour of waking,  like Frederick the Redbeard in the Kyffhaeuser, Charlemagne in the  Untersberg at Salzburg, Holger the Dane near Kronburg, and King Arthur  in a mountain of his native country. There sits King Mathias with his  warriors, by a table under a linden tree. Another song makes him, like  Orpheus with Eurydice, go down to hell with his fiddle in his hand to  bring thence his departed bride. But he has no better luck than Orpheus;  on the way out she breaks the commanded silence by saying a word to her  companion, and so is lost forever. These songs are still sung by the  Carinthian soldiers at night, around their watch-fires. There are others  of more modern origin, but they are weak and colorless compared with  these relics of the old heroic time.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Bryant's delightful \"Letters of a Traveler,\" of which we have  heretofore spoken, has been issued by Mr. Putnam in a new and very  beautiful edition, enriched with many exquisite engravings, under the  title of \"The Picturesque Souvenir.\" It is a work of permanent value,  and in the style of its publication is hardly surpassed by any of the  splendid volumes of the season.           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Laing, one of those restless English travelers who have printed  books about the United States, is now a prominent personage in  Australia, where he has been elected a member of the newly instituted  Legislature, for the city of Sidney. Upon the conclusion of the canvass  he made a speech, after which he was dragged home in his carriage by  some of the more energetic of his partisans, the horses having been  removed by them for that purpose. He is opposed to the Government.           *       *       *       *       *    The History of Liberty, by Mr. Samuel Elliot, of Boston, is examined at  considerable length and in a very genial spirit, in the last number of  the _Revue des Deux Mondes_--a review, by the way, in which much more  attention appears to be paid to our literature than it receives in the  _North American_. The writer observes, in the beginning, that the two  initial volumes of Mr. Elliot's great work, now published, in which the  _Liberty of Rome_ is treated, would be a superhuman performance, if  Niebuhr, Muller, Heeren, Grote, and Thirlwall, had not written, and  compares the work of our countryman with the poem on the same subject by  Thomson, the author of \"The Seasons.\" He says:         \"Mr."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3788"],[0,"Haydn (#13)"],[1,"that survive are almost all short  ballads expressing this sentiment or connected with it by their nautical  subjects.\" When Haydn arrived, there was, in short, no native composer  of real genius, and our \"tardy, apish nation\" was ready to welcome with  special cordiality an artist whose gifts were of a higher order.    Salomon    We have spoken of Haydn's visit as a long-meditated project. In 1787  Cramer, the violinist, had offered to engage him on his own terms for  the Professional Concerts; and Gallini, the director of the King's  Theatre in Drury Lane, pressed him to write an opera for that house.  Nothing came of these proposals, mainly because Haydn was too much  attached to his prince to think of leaving him, even temporarily. But  the time arrived and the man with it. The man was Johann Peter  Salomon, a violinist, who, having fallen out with the directors of the  professional concerts, had started concerts on his own account. Salomon  was a native of Bonn, and had been a member of the Electoral Orchestra  there. He had travelled about the Continent a good deal, and no one was  better fitted to organize and direct a series of concerts on a large  scale. In 1790 he had gone abroad in search of singers, and, hearing of  the death of Prince Esterhazy, he set off at once for Vienna, resolved  to secure Haydn at any cost. \"My name is Salomon,\" he bluntly announced  to the composer, as he was shown into his room one morning. \"I have come  from London to fetch you; we will settle terms to-morrow.\"    The question of terms was, we may be sure, important enough for Haydn.  But it was not the only question. The \"heavy years\" were beginning to  weigh upon him. He was bordering on threescore, and a long journey in  those days was not to be lightly undertaken. Moreover, he was still,  nominally at least, the servant of Prince Anton, whose consent would  have to be obtained; and, besides all this, he was engaged on various  commissions, notably some for the King of Naples, which were probably a  burden on his conscience. His friends, again, do not appear to have been  very enthusiastic about the projected visit. There were Dittersdorf and  Albrechtsberger, and Dr Leopold von Genzinger, the prince's physician,  and Frau von Genzinger, whose tea and coffee he so much appreciated, and  who sent him such excellent cream. Above all, there was Mozart--\"a man  very dear to me,\" as Haydn himself said.    Mozart and Haydn    He had always greatly revered Mozart. Three years before this he wrote:  \"I only wish I could impress upon every friend of mine, and on great men  in particular, the same deep musical sympathy and profound appreciation  which I myself feel for Mozart's inimitable music; then nations would  vie with each other to possess such a jewel within their frontiers. It  enrages me to think that the unparalleled Mozart is not yet engaged at  any Imperial Court! Forgive my excitement; I love the man so dearly.\"  The regard was reciprocal. \"Oh, Papa,\" exclaimed Mozart, when he heard  of Haydn's intention to travel, \"you have had no education for the wide,  wide world, and you speak too few languages.\" It was feelingly said, and  Haydn knew it. \"My language,\" he replied, with a smile, \"is understood  all over the world.\" Mozart was really concerned at the thought of  parting with his brother composer, to whom he stood almost in the  relation of a son. When it came to the actual farewell, the tears sprang  to his eyes, and he said affectingly: \"This is good-bye; we shall never  meet again.\" The words proved prophetic. A year later, Mozart was thrown  with a number of paupers into a grave which is now as unknown as the  grave of Moliere. Haydn deeply lamented his loss; and when his thoughts  came to be turned homewards towards the close of his English visit his  saddest reflection was that there would be no Mozart to meet him. His  wretched wife had tried to poison his mind against his friend by writing  that Mozart had been disparaging his genius. \"I cannot believe it,\" he  cried; \"if it is true, I will forgive him.\" It was not true, and Haydn  never believed it. As late as 1807 he burst into tears when Mozart's  name was mentioned, and then, recovering himself, remarked: \"Forgive me!  I must ever weep at the name of my Mozart.\"    Terms for London    But to return. Salomon at length carried the day, and everything was  arranged for the London visit. Haydn was to have 300 pounds for six  symphonies and 200 pounds for the copyright of them; 200 pounds for  twenty new compositions to be produced by himself at the same number of  concerts; and 200 pounds from a benefit concert. The composer paid his  travelling expenses himself, being assisted in that matter by an advance  of 450 florins from the prince, which he refunded within the year. In  order to provide for his wife during his absence he sold his house at  Eisenstadt, the gift of Prince Nicolaus, which had been twice rebuilt  after being destroyed by fire.    Salomon sent advance notices of the engagement to London, and on the  30th of December the public were informed through the Morning Chronicle  that, immediately on his arrival with his distinguished guest, \"Mr  Salomon would have the honour of submitting to all lovers of music his  programme for a series of subscription concerts, the success of which  would depend upon their support and approbation.\" Before leaving for  London Haydn had a tiff with the King of Naples, Ferdinand IV, who was  then in Vienna. The composer had taken him some of the works which he  had been commissioned to write, and His Majesty, thanking him for the  favour, remarked that \"We will rehearse them the day after to-morrow.\"  \"The day after to-morrow,\" replied Haydn, \"I shall be on my way to  England.\" \"What!\" exclaimed the King, \"and you promised to come to  Naples!\" With which observation he turned on his heel and indignantly  left the room. Before Haydn had time to recover from his astonishment  Ferdinand was back with a letter of introduction to Prince Castelcicala,  the Neapolitan Ambassador in London; and to show further that the  misunderstanding was merely a passing affair he sent the composer later  in the day a valuable tabatiere as a token of esteem and regard.    Bonn and Beethoven    The journey to London was begun by Haydn and Salomon on the 15th of  December 1790, and the travellers arrived at Bonn on Christmas Day. It  is supposed, with good reason, that Haydn here met Beethoven, then  a youth of twenty, for the first time. Beethoven was a member of the  Electoral Chapel, and we know that Haydn, after having one of his masses  performed and being complimented by the Elector, the musical brother of  Joseph II, entertained the chief musicians at dinner at his lodgings. An  amusing description of the regale may be read in Thayer's biography  of Beethoven. From Bonn the journey was resumed by way of Brussels to  Calais, which was reached in a violent storm and an incessant downpour  of rain. \"I am very well, thank God!\" writes the composer to Frau  Genzinger, \"although somewhat thinner, owing to fatigue, irregular  sleep, and eating and drinking so many different things.\"    Haydn Sea-Sick    Next morning, after attending early mass, he embarked at 7:30, and  landed at Dover at five o'clock in the afternoon. It was his first  acquaintance with the sea, and, as the weather was rather rough, he  makes no little of it in letters written from London. \"I remained on  deck during the whole passage,\" he says, \"in order to gaze my full  at that huge monster--the ocean. So long as there was a calm I had no  fears, but when at length a violent wind began to blow, rising every  minute, and I saw the boisterous high waves running on, I was seized  with a little alarm and a little indisposition likewise.\" Thus  delicately does he allude to a painful episode.    Arrives in London    Haydn reached London in the opening days of 1791. He passed his first  night at the house of Bland, the music-publisher, at 45 High Holborn,  which now, rebuilt, forms part of the First Avenue Hotel. Bland, it  should have been mentioned before, had been sent over to Vienna by  Salomon to coax Haydn into an engagement in 1787. When he was admitted  on that occasion to Haydn's room, he found the composer in the act of  shaving, complaining the while of the bluntness of his razor. \"I would  give my best quartet for a good razor,\" he exclaimed testily. The hint  was enough for Bland, who immediately hurried off to his lodgings and  fetched a more serviceable tool. Haydn was as good as his word:  he presented Bland with his latest quartet, and the work is still  familiarly known as the \"Rasirmesser\" (razor) Quartet. The incident  was, no doubt, recalled when Haydn renewed his acquaintance with the  music-publisher.    But Haydn did not remain the guest of Bland. Next day he went to live  with Salomon, at 18 Great Pulteney Street, Golden Square, which--also  rebuilt--is now the warehouse of Messrs Chatto & Windus, the publishers.  [See Musical Haunts in London, by F.G. Edwards, London, 1895] He  described it in one of his letters as \"a neat, comfortable lodging,\"  and extolled the cooking of his Italian landlord, \"who gives us four  excellent dishes.\" But his frugal mind was staggered at the charges.  \"Everything is terribly dear here,\" he wrote. \"We each pay 1 florin 30  kreuzers [about 2s. 8d.] a day, exclusive of wine and beer.\" This was  bad enough.    An Enthusiastic Welcome    But London made up for it all by the flattering way in which it received  the visitor. People of the highest rank called on him; ambassadors left  cards; the leading musical societies vied with each other in their zeal  to do him honour. Even the poetasters began to twang their lyres in his  praise. Thus Burney, who had been for some time in correspondence with  him, saluted him with an effusion, of which it will suffice to quote the  following lines:    Welcome, great master!"]]]
