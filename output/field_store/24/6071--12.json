Eulenburg,[20] indeed, records 17 cases of  hysteria, affecting children at ages nine to fourteen years; of these  nine were boys, and eight girls. Clopatt, on the other hand, collected  from the literature of the subject 272 cases of hysteria in young  children, 96 being boys, and 176 girls. Typhoid is commoner in males;  and Moebius lays stress on the fact, which he regards as especially  striking, that the difference in the sex-incidence of this disease is  manifest even in childhood. As regards colour-blindness, there is a  notable preponderance among males, and since we here have to do with a  congenital affection, this preponderance is as marked among children as  among adults. Many defects of speech also exhibit a notable difference  in their sex-incidence. Hermann Gutzmann[21] has shown that in the case  of stammerers we find 71 per cent. boys and 29 per cent. girls. I take  this opportunity of referring briefly to the fact that, as Max  Marcuse[22] reports, certain diseases of the skin exhibit sexual  differentiation of type even during childhood. The disseminated  cutaneous gangrene of children is far more frequent in girls than it is  in boys; Broker, among twelve cases, found ten girls. Alopecia areata,  on the other hand, affects both sexes with equal frequency, but affects  them at different ages. Whereas during the first years of life girls are  more frequently attacked; when the age of twenty is passed, the relation  between the sexes in this respect are reversed.    Criminological experiences appear also to confirm the notion of an  inherited sexual differentiation, in children as well as in adults.  According to various statistics, embracing not only the period of  childhood, but including as well the period of youth, we learn that  girls constitute one-fifth only of the total number of youthful  criminals. A number of different explanations have been offered to  account for this disproportion. Thus, for instance, attention has been  drawn to the fact that a girl's physical weakness renders her incapable  of attempting violent assaults upon the person, and this would suffice  to explain why it is that girls so rarely commit such crimes. In the  case of offences for which bodily strength is less requisite, such as  fraud, theft, &c., the number of youthful female offenders is  proportionately larger, although here also they are less numerous than  males of corresponding age charged with the like offences. It has been  asserted that in the law courts girls find more sympathy than boys, and  that for this reason the former receive milder sentences than the  latter; hence it results that in appearance merely the criminality of  girls is less than that of boys. Others, again, refer the differences in  respect of criminality between the youthful members of the two sexes to  the influences of education and general environment. Morrison,[23]  however, maintains that all these influences combined are yet  insufficient to account for the great disproportion between the sexes,  and insists that there exists in youth as well as in adult life a  specific sexual differentiation, based, for the most part, upon  biological differences of a mental and physical character. I have  referred to these criminological data for the sake of completeness, but  I feel it necessary to add that their importance in relation to our  subject of study is comparatively trifling, since most of the cases in  question are offences committed by persons who can no longer properly be  regarded as children.    As we have seen, during childhood, and especially during the second  period of childhood, there exists a larger number of sexual differences  both mental and physical. Some of these are obviously discernible when  we compare isolated individuals; others only become apparent when we  institute a statistical comparison. And when such differences appear in  childhood, we find that they are quantitatively less extensive than the  sexual differences of adults. For the sexual life is in the child less  developed than it is in the adult. We shall learn that in the matter of  the sexual impulse, the child exhibits an imperfect differentiation. A  similarly imperfect differentiation is found in childhood in respect of  a number of other qualities. Thus, there are many diseases which later  in life manifest a sexual differentiation, but in childhood are  undifferentiated. We observe a similar age-distinction in respect of  suicide, which occurs in Europe far more frequently in men than in  women, the ratio among suicides being three or four men to one woman.  Among child-suicides there is far less disproportion between the sexes.  According to Havelock Ellis, indeed, the suicidal tendency makes its  appearance in girls at an earlier age than in boys.    Such a marked differentiation as there is between the adult man and the  adult woman certainly does not exist in childhood. Similarly in respect  of many other qualities, alike bodily and mental, in respect of many  inclinations and numerous activities, we find that in childhood sexual  differentiation is less marked than it is in adult life. None the less,  we have learned in this chapter, a number of sexual differences can be  shown to exist even in childhood; and as regards many other differences,  though they are not yet apparent, we are nevertheless compelled to  assume that they already exist potentially in the organs of the child.          CHAPTER IV    SYMPTOMATOLOGY      The data recorded in the preceding chapter suffice to show that the  activity of the sexual life begins in childhood, for the secondary  sexual characters and the other sexual peculiarities which manifest  themselves thus early in life are dependent upon sex. We shall now  proceed to the systematic description of the direct manifestations of  the sexual life, and we can most usefully begin with the genital organs.    Erections occur during childhood; they have been observed even in  infancy. They sometimes result from external stimuli, especially of a  pathological nature, such as a strictured prepuce, or inflammatory  states of the penis. Occasionally in the child, as normally in the adult  male, distension of the bladder with urine leads to erection of the  penis. Although in these cases the erection is not induced by sexual  processes, it is nevertheless not devoid of significance in relation to  the sexual life. The sensations in the genital organs to which the  pathological stimuli give rise are further increased by the erection,  and the child's attention is therefore increasingly drawn to his sexual  organs. His attention may, of course, be directed to his genital organs  by such stimuli as those we have described, even though these latter do  not lead to the occurrence of erection. By such sensations, the child is  very readily induced to manipulate his genital organs. Just as the  little child soon learns to scratch other itching regions of the skin,  so also he learns to scratch his genital organs when these are the seat  of an itching eruption, or when in any other way irritating sensations  arise in this region. Pflueger and Preyer[24] have made investigations  regarding the itching-reflex (_Kitzelreflexe_), and although in many  respects their results are divergent, yet one point is clearly  established by both, namely, that within a few months after birth a  distinct itching-reflex is in operation, inasmuch as the child  endeavours to scratch itching areas. Thus, by itching of the genital  organs, a child is readily led to practise masturbation; and this is not  necessarily effected by the hands, but sometimes by the feet, or by  rubbing the thighs against one another, this last being generally done  when the child is in the sitting posture. When erections occur in the  child, we cannot always trace them to external stimuli, for in many  cases they are due to stimuli of other kinds. Erection may, in fact,  result from internal stimuli, connected with the development of the  genital organs, and more especially that of the testicles. Moreover,  such developmental stimuli may induce the child to manipulate the  genital organs, and thus give rise to masturbation, without in the first  instance causing erection. It appears that such stimuli leading to the  practice of masturbation occur, during the first years of childhood,  chiefly, if not exclusively, in children with morbid hereditary  predisposition.    Such processes as these, viz., inflammatory stimuli originating in the  external genital organs, or developmental stimuli proceeding from the  testicles, may lead to the practice of masturbation without having  directly affected the child's consciousness. Just as in the pithed frog,  if we stimulate one foot with acetic acid, the other foot scratches the  irritated area, so a child may, with his hands or in some other way,  scratch itching regions of the body, and, above all, of the external  genital organs, without its being necessary for us to assume that he is  fully conscious of what he is doing. Further, as we have already pointed  out, such masturbation may or may not be preceded by a reflex erection.  And just as the boy soon learns that itching is relieved by scratching,  so also he learns that by means of artificial stimulation he may induce  sensations of a voluptuous character. It is the same with the little  girl, in whom sensations occur in the genital organs, due in some cases  to developmental, and in others to pathological stimuli (skin eruptions  are an instance of the latter kind), and these lead to manipulations of  the genital organs.    In contradistinction to the cases just described, in which the child  has learned spontaneously to practise artificial stimulation of his  genital organs, are the cases in which seduction by others is the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28434"],[0,"The Astronomy of Milton's 'Paradise Lost' (#13)"],[1,"constitution, and except that they were regarded as  glittering points of light which illumine the firmament, all else  appertaining to them remained an unravelled mystery. Even Copernicus had  no notion of a universe of stars.    Galileo, by his discovery that the galaxy consists of a multitude of  separate stars too remote to be defined by ordinary vision, demonstrated  how vast are the dimensions of the starry heavens, and on what a  stupendous scale the universe is constructed. But at this time it had  not occurred to astronomers, nor was it known until many years after,  that the stars are suns which shine with a splendour resembling that of  our Sun, and in many instances surpassing it. It was not until this  truth became known that the glories of the sidereal heavens were fully  comprehended, and their magnificence revealed. It was then ascertained  that the minute points of light which crowd the fields of our largest  telescopes, in their aggregations forming systems, clusters, galaxies,  and universes of stars, are shining orbs of light, among the countless  multitudes of which our Sun may be numbered as one.          CHAPTER III    MILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE      It would be reasonable to imagine that Milton's knowledge of astronomy  was comprehensive and accurate, and superior to that possessed by most  scientific men of his age. His scholarly attainments, his familiarity  with ancient history and philosophy, his profound learning, and the  universality of his general knowledge, would lead one to conclude that  the science which treats of the mechanism of the heavens, and especially  the observational part of it--which at all times has been a source of  inspiration to poets of every degree of excellence--was to him a study  of absorbing interest, and one calculated to make a deep impression upon  his devoutly poetical mind. The serious character of Milton's verse, and  the reverent manner in which celestial incidents and objects are  described in it, impress one with the belief that his contemplation of  the heavens, and of the orbs that roll and shine in the firmament  overhead, afforded him much enjoyment and meditative delight. For no  poet, in ancient or in modern times, has introduced into his writings  with such frequency, or with such pleasing effect, so many passages  descriptive of the beauty and grandeur of the heavens. No other poet,  by the creative effort of his imagination, has soared to such a height;  nor has he ever been excelled in his descriptions of the celestial orbs,  and of the beautiful phenomena associated with their different motions.    In his minor poems, which were composed during his residence at Horton,  a charming rural retreat in Buckinghamshire, where the freshness and  varied beauty of the landscape and the attractive aspects of the  midnight sky were ever before him, we find enchanting descriptions of  celestial objects, and especially of those orbs which, by their  brilliancy and lustre, have always commanded the admiration of mankind.    For example, in 'L'Allegro' there are the following lines:--        Right against the eastern gate      Where the great Sun begins his state,      Robed in flames and amber light,      The clouds in thousand liveries dight;    and in 'Il Penseroso'--        To behold the wandering Moon,      Riding near her highest noon,      Like one that had been led astray      Through the heaven's wide pathless way,      And oft as if her head she bowed,      Stooping through a fleecy cloud.    In the happy choice of his theme, and by the comprehensive manner in  which he has treated it, Milton has been enabled by his poetic genius to  give to the world in his 'Paradise Lost' a poem which, for sublimity of  thought, loftiness of imagination, and beauty of expression in metrical  verse, is unsurpassed in any language.    It is, however, our intention to deal only with those passages in the  poem in which allusion is made to the heavenly bodies, and to incidents  and occurrences associated with astronomical phenomena. In the  exposition and illustration of these it has been considered desirable to  adopt the following general classification:--    1. To ascertain the extent of Milton's astronomical knowledge.    2. To describe the starry heavens and the celestial objects mentioned in  'Paradise Lost.'    3. To exemplify the use which Milton has made of astronomy in the  exercise of his imaginative and descriptive powers.    In the earlier half of the seventeenth century the Ptolemaic theory--by  which it was believed that the Earth was the immovable centre of the  universe, and that round it all the heavenly bodies completed a diurnal  revolution--still retained its ascendency over the minds of men of  learning and science, and all the doctrines associated with this ancient  astronomical creed were still religiously upheld by the educated classes  among the peoples inhabiting the different civilised regions of the  globe. The Copernican theory--by which the Sun is assigned the central  position in our system, with the Earth and planets revolving in orbits  round him--obtained the support of a few persons of advanced views and  high scientific attainments, but its doctrines had not yet seriously  threatened the supremacy of the older system. Though upwards of one  hundred years had elapsed since the death of Copernicus, yet the  doctrines associated with the system of which he was the founder were  but very tardily adopted up to this time. There were several reasons  which accounted for this. The Copernican system was at first imperfect  in its details, and included several of the Ptolemaic, doctrines which  rendered it less intelligible, and retarded its acceptance by persons  who would otherwise have been inclined to adopt it. Copernicus believed  that the planets travelled round the Sun in circular paths. This  necessitated the retention of cycles and epicycles, which gave rise to  much confusion; nor was it until Kepler made his great discovery of the  ellipticity of the planetary orbits that they were eliminated from the  system.    As the Ptolemaic system of the universe held complete sway over the  minds of men for upwards of twenty centuries, it was difficult to  persuade many persons to renounce the astronomical beliefs to which they  were so firmly attached, in favour of those of any other system; so that  the overthrow of this venerable theory required a lengthened period of  time for its accomplishment.    It was thus in his earlier years, when Milton devoted his time to the  study of literature and philosophy, which he read extensively when  pursuing his academic career at Christ's College, Cambridge, and  afterwards at Horton, where he spent several years in acquiring a more  proficient knowledge of the literary, scientific, and philosophical  writings of the age, that he found the beliefs associated with the  Ptolemaic theory adopted without doubt or hesitation by the numerous  authors whose works he perused. His knowledge of Italian enabled him to  become familiar with Dante--one of his favourite authors, whose poetical  writings were deeply read by him, and who, in the elaboration of his  poem, the 'Divina Commedia,' included the entire Ptolemaic cosmology.    In England the Copernican theory had few supporters, and the majority of  those who represented the intellect and learning of the country still  retained their adherence to the old form of astronomical belief. We  therefore find that Milton followed the traditional way of thinking by  adopting the views associated with the Ptolemaic theory.    According to the Ptolemaic system, the Earth was regarded as the  immovable centre of the universe, and surrounding it were ten  crystalline spheres, or heavens, arranged in concentric circles, the  larger spheres enclosing the smaller ones; and within those was situated  the cosmos, or mundane universe, usually described as 'the Heavens and  the Earth.' To each of the first seven spheres there was attached a  heavenly body, which was carried round the Earth by the revolution of  the crystalline.    1st sphere: that of the Moon.    2nd sphere: that of the planet Mercury.    3rd sphere: that of the planet Venus.    4th sphere: that of the Sun; regarded as a planet.    5th sphere: that of the planet Mars.    6th sphere: that of the planet Jupiter.    7th sphere: that of the planet Saturn.    8th sphere: that of the fixed stars.    [Illustration: FIG. 1]    The eighth sphere included all the fixed stars, and was called the  firmament, because it was believed to impart steadiness to the inner  spheres, and, by its diurnal revolution, to carry them round the Earth,  causing the change of day and night.    The separate motions of the spheres, revolving with different  velocities, and at different angles to each other, accounted for the  astronomical phenomena associated with the orbs attached to each.  According to Ptolemy's scheme, the eighth sphere formed the outermost  boundary of the universe; but later astronomers added to this system two  other spheres--a _ninth_, called the _Crystalline_, which caused  Precession of the Equinoxes; and a _tenth_, called the _Primum Mobile_,  or First Moved, which brought about the alternation of day and night, by  carrying all the other spheres round the Earth once in every twenty-four  hours. The Primum Mobile enclosed, as if in a shell, all the other  spheres, in which was included the created universe, and, although of  vast dimensions, its conception did not overwhelm the mind in the same  manner that the effort to comprehend infinitude does.    Beyond this last sphere there was believed to exist a boundless,  uncircumscribed region, of immeasurable extent, called the Empyrean, or  Heaven of Heavens, the incorruptible abode of the Deity, the place of  eternal mysteries, which the comprehension of man was unable to fathom,  and of which it was impossible for his mind to form any"]]]
