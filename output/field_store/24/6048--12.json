The executioner  inserted a horn into the patient's mouth, and if he shut his teeth,  forced him to open them by pinching his nose with the finger and thumb.]    prepared for her, and turned to the registrar--for she would not address  the executioner--saying, with a smile, \"No doubt all this water is to  drown me in? I hope you don't suppose that a person of my size could  swallow it all.\" The executioner said not a word, but began taking off  her cloak and all her other garments, until she was completely naked. He  then led her up to the wall and made her sit on the rack of the ordinary  question, two feet from the ground. There she was again asked to give  the names of her accomplices, the composition of the poison and its  antidote; but she made the same reply as to the doctor, only adding, \"If  you do not believe me, you have my body in your hands, and you can  torture me.\"    The registrar signed to the executioner to do his duty. He first  fastened the feet of the marquise to two rings close together fixed to a  board; then making her lie down, he fastened her wrists to two other  rings in the wall, distant about three feet from each other. The head  was at the same height as the feet, and the body, held up on a trestle,  described a half-curve, as though lying over a wheel. To increase the  stretch of the limbs, the man gave two turns to a crank, which pushed  the feet, at first about twelve inches from the rings, to a distance of  six inches. And here we may leave our narrative to reproduce the  official report.    \"On the small trestle, while she was being stretched, she said several  times, 'My God! you are killing me! And I only spoke the truth.'    \"The water was given: she turned and twisted, saying, 'You are killing  me!'    \"The water was again given.    \"Admonished to name her accomplices, she said there was only one man,  who had asked her for poison to get rid of his wife, but he was dead.    \"The water was given; she moved a little, but would not say anything.    \"Admonished to say why, if she had no accomplice, she had written from  the Conciergerie to Penautier, begging him to do all he could for her,  and to remember that his interests in this matter were the same as her  own, she said that she never knew Penautier had had any understanding  with Sainte-Croix about the poisons, and it would be a lie to say  otherwise; but when a paper was found in Sainte-Croix's box that  concerned Penautier, she remembered how often she had seen him at the  house, and thought it possible that the friendship might have included  some business about the poisons; that, being in doubt on the point, she  risked writing a letter as though she were sure, for by doing so she was  not prejudicing her own case; for either Penautier was an accomplice of  Sainte-Croix or he was not. If he was, he would suppose the marquise  knew enough to accuse him, and would accordingly do his best to save  her; if he was not, the letter was a letter wasted, and that was all.    \"The water was again given; she turned and twisted much, but said that  on this subject she had said all she possibly could; if she said  anything else, it would be untrue.\"    The ordinary question was at an end. The marquise had now taken half the  quantity of water she had thought enough to drown her. The executioner  paused before he proceeded to the extraordinary question. Instead of the  trestle two feet and a half high on which she lay, they passed under her  body a trestle of three and a half feet, which gave the body a greater  arch, and as this was done without lengthening the ropes, her limbs were  still further stretched, and the bonds, tightly straining at wrists and  ankles, penetrated the flesh and made the blood run. The question began  once more, interrupted by the demands of the registrar and the answers  of the sufferer. Her cries seemed not even to be heard.    \"On the large trestle, during the stretching, she said several times, 'O  God, you tear me to, pieces! Lord, pardon me! Lord, have mercy upon me!'    \"Asked if she had nothing more to tell regarding her accomplices, she  said they might kill her, but she would not tell a lie that would  destroy her soul.    \"The water was given, she moved about a little, but would not speak.    \"Admonished that she should tell the composition of the poisons and  their antidotes, she said that she did not know what was in them; the  only thing she could recall was toads; that Sainte-Croix never revealed  his secret to her; that she did not believe he made them himself, but  had them prepared by Glazer; she seemed to remember that some of them  contained nothing but rarefied arsenic; that as to an antidote, she knew  of no other than milk; and Sainte-Croix had told her that if one had  taken milk in the morning, and on the first onset of the poison took  another glassful, one would have nothing to fear.    \"Admonished to say if she could add anything further, she said she had  now told everything; and if they killed her, they could not extract  anything more.    \"More water was given; she writhed a little, and said she was dead, but  nothing more.    \"More water was given; she writhed more violently, but would say no  more.    \"Yet again water was given; writhing and twisting, she said, with a deep  groan, 'O my God, I am killed!' but would speak no more.\"    Then they tortured her no further: she was let down, untied, and placed  before the fire in the usual manner. While there, close to the fire,  lying on the mattress, she was visited by the good doctor, who, feeling  he could not bear to witness the spectacle just described, had asked her  leave to retire, that he might say a mass for her, that God might grant  her patience and courage. It is plain that the good priest had not  prayed in vain.    \"Ah,\" said the marquise, when she perceived him, \"I have long been  desiring to see you again, that you might comfort me. My torture has  been very long and very painful, but this is the last time I shall have  to treat with men; now all is with God for the future. See my hands,  sir, and my feet, are they not torn and wounded? Have not my  executioners smitten me in the same places where Christ was smitten?\"    \"And therefore, madame,\" replied the priest, \"these sufferings now are  your happiness; each torture is one step nearer to heaven. As you say,  you are now for God alone; all your thoughts and hopes must be fastened  upon Him; we must pray to Him, like the penitent king, to give you a  place among His elect; and since nought that is impure can pass thither,  we must strive, madame, to purify you from all that might bar the way to  heaven.\"    The marquise rose with the doctor's aid, for she could scarcely stand;  tottering, she stepped forward between him and the executioner, who took  charge of her immediately after the sentence was read, and was not  allowed to leave her before it was completely carried out. They all  three entered the chapel and went into the choir, where the doctor and  the marquise knelt in adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. At that moment  several persons appeared in the nave, drawn by curiosity. They could not  be turned out, so the executioner, to save the marquise from being  annoyed, shut the gate of the choir, and let the patient pass behind the  altar. There she sat down in a chair, and the doctor on a seat opposite;  then he first saw, by the light of the chapel window, how greatly  changed she was. Her face, generally so pale, was inflamed, her eyes  glowing and feverish, all her body involuntarily trembling. The doctor  would have spoken a few words of consolation, but she did not attend.  \"Sir,\" she said, \"do you know that my sentence is an ignominious one? Do  you know there is fire in the sentence?\"    The doctor gave no answer; but, thinking she needed something, bade the  gaoler to bring her wine. A minute later he brought it in a cup, and the  doctor handed it to the marquise, who moistened her lips and then gave  it back. She then noticed that her neck was uncovered, and took out her  handkerchief to cover it, asking the gaoler for a pin to fasten it with.  When he was slow in finding a pin, looking on his person for it, she  fancied that he feared she would choke herself, and shaking her head,  said, with a smile, \"You have nothing to fear now; and here is the  doctor, who will pledge his word that I will do myself no mischief.\"    \"Madame,\" said the gaoler, handing her the pin she wanted, \"I beg your  pardon for keeping you waiting. I swear I did not distrust you; if  anyone distrusts you, it is not I.\"    Then kneeling before her, he begged to kiss her hand. She gave it, and  asked him to pray to God for her. \"Ah yes,\" he cried, sobbing, \"with all  my heart.\" She then fastened her dress as best she could with her hands  tied, and when the gaoler had gone and she was alone with the doctor,  said:--    \"Did you not hear what I said, sir? I told you there was fire in my  sentence. And though it is only after death that my body is to be burnt,  it will always be a terrible disgrace on my memory. I am saved the pain  of being burnt alive, and thus, perhaps, saved from a death of despair,  but the shamefulness is the same, and it is that I think of.\"    \"Madame,\" said the doctor, \"it in no way affects your soul's salvation  whether your body is cast into the fire and reduced to ashes or whether  it is buried in the ground and eaten by worms, whether it is drawn on a  hurdle and thrown upon a dung-heap, or embalmed with Oriental perfumes  and laid in a rich man's tomb. Whatever may be your end, your body will  arise on the appointed day, and if Heaven so will, it will come forth  from its ashes more glorious than a royal corpse lying at this moment in  a gilded casket. Obsequies, madame, are for those who survive, not for  the dead.\"    A sound was heard at the door of the choir.

The World Factbook is in the public domain and may be used freely by  anyone at anytime without seeking permission. However, US Code  prohibits use of the CIA seal in a manner which implies that the CIA  approved, endorsed, or authorized such use. If you have any questions  about your intended use, you should consult with legal counsel. Further  information on The World Factbook's use is described on the  Contributors and Copyright Information page. As a courtesy, please cite  The World Factbook when used.      Why doesn't The World Factbook include information on states,  departments, provinces, etc., in the country format?    The World Factbook provides national-level information on countries,  territories, and dependencies, but not subnational administrative units  within a country. A good encyclopedia should provide state/province-  level information.      Is it possible to access older editions of The World Factbook to do  comparative research and trend analysis?    Only the current version is available for browsing on the CIA Web site.  In the future, the staff hopes to post electronic versions of The World  Factbook as far back as 1986. Hardcopy editions for earlier years are  available from libraries.      Would it be possible to set up a partnership or collaboration between  the producers of The World Factbook and other organizations or  individuals?    The World Factbook does not partner with other organizations or  individuals, but we do welcome comments and suggestions that such  groups or persons choose to provide.      Geography    I can't find a geographic name for a particular country. Why not?    The World Factbook is not a gazetteer (a dictionary or index of places,  usually with descriptive or statistical information) and cannot provide  more than the names of the administrative divisions (in the Government  category) and major cities/towns (on the country maps). Our expanded  Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names, however, includes many of the  world's major geographic features as well as historic (former) names of  countries and cities mentioned in The World Factbook.      Why are Taiwan and the European Union listed out of alphabetical order  at the end of the Factbook entries?    Taiwan is listed after the regular entries because even though the  mainland People's Republic of China claims Taiwan, elected Taiwanese  authorities de facto administer the island and reject mainland  sovereignty claims. With the establishment of diplomatic relations with  China on January 1, 1979, the US Government recognized the People's  Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging  the Chinese position that there is only one China and that Taiwan is  part of China.      The European Union (EU) is not a country, but it has taken on many  nation-like attributes and these are likely to be expanded in the  future. A more complete explanation on the inclusion of the EU into the  Factbook may be found in the Preliminary statement.      Since we have an ambassador who represents the US at the Vatican, why  is this entity not listed in the Factbook?    Vatican City is found under Holy See. The term \"Holy See\" refers to the  authority, jurisdiction, and sovereignty vested in the Pope and his  advisors to direct the worldwide Catholic Church. The Holy See has a  legal personality that allows it to enter into treaties as the  juridical equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic  representatives. Vatican City, created in 1929 to administer properties  belonging to the Holy See in Rome, is recognized under international  law as a sovereign state, but it does not send or receive diplomatic  representatives. Consequently, Holy See is included as a Factbook  entry, with Vatican City cross-referenced in the Geographic Names  appendix.      Why is Palestine not listed in The World Factbook?    The areas that could potentially form a future Palestinian state -- the  West Bank and Gaza Strip -- do appear in the Factbook. These areas are  presently Israeli-occupied with current status subject to the Israeli-  Palestinian 1995 Interim Agreement; their permanent status is to be  determined through further negotiation.      Why are the Golan Heights not shown as part of Israel or Northern  Cyprus with Turkey?    Territorial occupations/annexations not recognized by the United States  Government are not shown on US Government maps.      Why don't you include information on entities such as Tibet, Kashmir,  or Kosovo?    The World Factbook provides information on the administrative divisions  of a country as recommended by the United States Board on Geographic  Names (BGN). The BGN is a component of the US Government that develops  policies, principles, and procedures governing the spelling, use, and  application of geographic names--domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and  undersea. Its decisions enable all departments and agencies of the US  Government to have access to uniform names of geographic features.      Also included in the Factbook are entries on parts of the world whose  status has not yet been resolved (e.g., West Bank, Spratly Islands).  Specific regions within a country or areas in dispute among countries  are not covered.      What do you mean when you say that a country is \"doubly landlocked\"?    A doubly landlocked country is one that is separated from an ocean or  an ocean-accessible sea by two intervening countries. Uzbekistan and  Liechtenstein are the only countries that fit this definition.      Spelling and Pronunciation    Why is the spelling of proper names such as rulers, presidents, and  prime ministers in The World Factbook different than their spelling in  my country?    The Factbook staff applies the names and spellings from the Chiefs of  State link on the CIA Web site. The World Factbook is prepared using  the standard American English computer keyboard and does not use any  special characters, symbols, or most diacritical markings in its  spellings. Surnames are always spelled with capital letters; they may  appear first in some cultures.      The spelling of geographic names, features, cities, administrative  divisions, etc. in the Factbook differs from those used in my country.  Why is this?    The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) recommends and  approves names and spellings. The BGN is the component of the United  States Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures  governing the spelling, use, and application of geographic names--  domestic, foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all  departments and agencies of the US Government to use uniform names of  geographic features. (A note is usually included where changes may have  occurred but have not yet been approved by the BGN). The World Factbook  is prepared using the standard American English computer keyboard and  does not use any special characters, symbols, or most diacritical  markings in its spellings.      Why doesn't The World Factbook include pronunciations of country or  leader names?    There are too many variations in pronunciation among English-speaking  countries, not to mention English renditions of non-English names, for  pronunciations to be included. American English pronunciations are  included for some countries like Qatar and Kiribati.      Why is the name of the Labour party misspelled?    When American and British spellings of common English words differ, The  World Factbook always uses the American spelling, even when these  common words form part of a proper name in British English.      Policies and Procedures    What is The World Factbook's source for a specific subject field?    The Factbook staff uses many different sources to publish what we judge  are the most reliable and consistent data for any particular category.  Space considerations preclude a listing of these various sources.      The names of some geographic features provided in the Factbook differ  from those used in other publications. For example, in Asia the  Factbook has Burma as the country name, but in other publications  Myanmar is used; also, the Factbook uses Sea of Japan whereas other  publications label it East Sea. What is your policy on naming  geographic features?    The Factbook staff follows the guidance of the United States Board on  Geographic Names (BGN). The BGN is the component of the United States  Government that develops policies, principles, and procedures governing  the spelling, use, and application of geographic names--domestic,  foreign, Antarctic, and undersea. Its decisions enable all departments  and agencies of the US Government to have access to uniform names of  geographic features. The position of the BGN is that the names Burma  and Sea of Japan be used in official US Government maps and  publications.      Why is most of the statistical information in the Factbook given in  metric units, rather than the units standard to US measure?    US Federal agencies are required by the Metric Conversion Act of 1975  (Public Law 94-168) and by Executive Order 12770 of July 1991 to use  the International System of Units, commonly referred to as the metric  system or SI. In addition, the metric system is used by over 95 percent  of the world's population.      Why don't you include information on minimum and maximum temperature  extremes?    The Factbook staff judges that this information would only be useful  for some (generally smaller) countries. Larger countries can have large  temperature extremes that do not represent the landmass as a whole. In  the future, such a category may be adopted listing the extremes, but  also adding a normal temperature range found throughout most of a  country's territory.      What information sources are used for the country flags?    Flag designs used in The World Factbook are those recognized by the  protocol office of"]]]
