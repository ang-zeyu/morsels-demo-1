In it rode the vet' who had taken Lady  away. He had stopped for a moment on his way to Paterson, to report as  to Lady's progress at his dog-hospital.    Lad was in the living-room at the time. As a maid answered the summons  at the door, he walked hospitably forward to greet the unknown guest.  The vet' stepped into the room by one door as the Master entered it by  the other--which was lucky for the vet'.    Lad took one look at the man who had stolen Lady. Then, without a  sound or other sign of warning, he launched his mighty bulk straight  at the vet's throat.    Accustomed though he was to the ways of dogs, the vet' had barely time  to brace himself and to throw one arm in front of his throat. And then  Lad's eighty pounds smote him on the chest, and Lad's powerful jaws  closed viselike on the forearm that guarded the man's throat. Deep  into the thick ulster the white teeth clove their way--through  ulster-sleeve and undercoat sleeve and the sleeves of a linen shirt  and of flannels--clear through to the flesh of the forearm.    \"_Lad!_\" shouted the Master, springing forward.    In obedience to the sharp command, Lad loosed his grip and dropped to  the floor--where he stood quivering with leashed fury.    Through the rage-mists that swirled over his brain, he knew he had  broken the Law. He had never merited punishment. He did not fear it.  But the Master's tone of fierce disapproval cut the sensitive dog soul  more painfully than any scourge could have cut his body.    \"Lad!\" cried the Master again, in rebuking amazement.    The dog turned, walked slowly over to the Master and lay down at his  feet. The Master, without another word, opened the front door and  pointed outward. Lad rose and slunk out. He had been ordered from the  house, and in a stranger's presence!    \"He thinks I'm responsible for his losing Lady,\" said the vet',  looking ruefully at his torn sleeve. \"That's why he went for me. I  don't blame the dog. Don't lick him.\"    \"I'm not going to lick him,\" growled the Master. \"I'd as soon thrash  a woman. Besides, I've just punished him worse than if I'd taken an  ax-handle to him. Send me a bill for your coat.\"    In late December came a thaw--a freak thaw that changed the white  ground to brown mud and rotted the smooth surface of the lake-ice to  gray slush. All day and all night the trees and the eaves sent forth a  dreary _drip-drip-drip_. It was the traditional January Thaw--set  forward a month.    On the third and last morning of the thaw Wolf galloped down to the  lake as usual. Lad jogged along at his side. As they reached the  margin, Lad sniffed and drew back. His weird sixth sense somehow told  him--as it tells an elephant--that there was danger ahead.    Wolf, however, was at the stage of extreme youth when neither dogs nor  humans are bothered by premonitions. Ahead of him stretched the huge  sheet of ice whereon he loved to gambol. Straightway he frisked out  upon it.    A rough growl of warning from Lad made him look back, but the lure of  the ice was stronger than the call of duty.    The current, at this point of the lake, twisted sharply landward in a  half-circle. Thus, for a few yards out, the rotting ice was still  thick, but where the current ran, it was thin, and as soggy as wet  blotting-paper--as Wolf speedily discovered.    He bounded on the thinner ice driving his hind claws into the slushy  surface for his second leap. He was dismayed to find that the ice  collapsed under the pounding feet. There was a dull, sloppy sound. A  ten-foot ice-cake broke off from the main sheet; breaking at once into  a dozen smaller cakes; and Wolf disappeared, tail first, into the  swift-running water beneath.    To the surface he came, at the outer edge of the hole. He was mad,  clear through, at the prank his beloved lake had played on him. He  struck out for shore. On the landward side of the opening his forefeet  clawed helplessly at the unbroken ledge of ice. He had not the  strength or the wit to crawl upon it and make his way to land. The  bitter chill of the water was already paralyzing him. The strong  current was tugging at his hindquarters. Anger gave way to panic. The  puppy wasted much of his remaining strength by lifting up his voice in  ear-splitting howls.    The Mistress and the Master, motoring into the drive from the highway  nearly a quarter-mile distant, heard the racket. The lake was plainly  visible to them through the bare trees, even at that distance, and  they took in the impending tragedy at a glance. They jumped out of the  car and set off at a run to the water-edge. The way was long and the  ground was heavy with mud. They could not hope to reach the lake  before the puppy's strength should fail.    But Lad was already there. At Wolf's first cry, Lad sprang out on the  ice that heaved and chucked and cracked under his greater weight. His  rush carried him to the very edge of the hole, and there, leaning  forward and bracing all four of his absurdly tiny white paws, he  sought to catch the puppy by the neck and lift him to safety. But  before his rescuing jaws could close on Wolf's fur, the decayed ice  gave way beneath his weight, and the ten-foot hole was widened by  another twenty feet of water.    Down went Lad with a crash, and up he came, in almost no time, a few  feet away from where Wolf floundered helplessly among the chunks of  drifting ice. The breaking off of the shoreward mass of ice, under  Lad's pressure, had left the puppy with no foothold at all. It had  ducked him and had robbed him even of the chance to howl.    His mouth and throat full of water, Wolf strangled and splashed in a  delirium of terror. Lad struck out for him, butting aside the  impending ice-chunks with his great shoulders, and swimming with a  rush that lifted a third of his tawny body out of water. His jaws  gripped Wolf by the middle of the back, and he swam thus with him  toward shore. At the edge of the shoreward ice he gave a heave which  called on every numbing muscle of the huge frame, and which--in spite  of the burden he held--again lifted his head and shoulders high above  water.    He thus flung Wolf's body halfway up on the ledge of ice. The puppy's  flying forepaws chanced to strike the ice-surface. His sharp claws bit  into its soft upper crust. With a frantic wriggle he was out of the  water and on top of this thicker stratum of shore-ice, and in a second  he had regained shore and was careering wildly up the lawn toward the  greater safety of his kennel.    Yet, halfway in his flight, courage returned to the sopping-wet  baby. He halted, turned about and, with a volley of falsetto barks,  challenged the offending water to come ashore and fight fair.    As Wolf's forepaws had gripped the ice, he had further aided his climb  to safety by thrusting downward with his hind legs. Both his hind paws  had struck Lad's head, their thrust had driven Lad clean under  water. There the current caught him.    When Lad came up, it was not to the surface but under the ice, some  yards below. The top of his head struck stunningly against the  underpart of the ice-sheet.    A lesser dog would then and there have given up the struggle, or else  would have thrashed about futilely until he drowned. Lad, perhaps on  instinct, perhaps on reason, struck out toward the light--the spot  where the great hole had let in sunshine through the gray ice-sheet.    The average dog is not trained to swim under water. To this day, it is  a mystery how Lad had the sense to hold his breath. He fought his way  on, inch by inch, against the current, beneath the scratching rough  under-surface of the ice--always toward the light. And just as his  lungs must have been ready to burst, he reached the open space.    Sputtering and panting, Lad made for shore. Presently he reached the  ice-ledge that lay between him and the bank. He reached it just as the  Master, squirming along, face downward and at full length, began to  work his way out over the swaying shore-ice toward him.    Twice the big dog raised himself almost to the top of the ledge. Once  the ice broke under his weight, dousing him. The second time he got  his fore-quarters well over the top of the ledge, and he was  struggling upward with all his tired body when the Master's hand  gripped his soaked ruff.    With this new help, Lad made a final struggle--a struggle that  laid him gasping but safe on the slushy surface of the thicker  ice. Backward over the few yards that still separated them from land  he and the Master crawled to the bank.    Lad was staggering as he started forward to greet the Mistress, and  his eyes were still dim and bloodshot from his fearful ordeal. Midway  in his progress toward the Mistress another dog barred his path--a dog  that fell upon him in an ecstasy of delighted welcome.    Lad cleared his water-logged nostrils for a growl of protest. He had  surely done quite enough for Wolf this day, without the puppy's trying  to rob him now of the Mistress' caress. He was tired, and he was  dizzy; and he wanted such petting and comfort and praise as only the  worshipped Mistress could give.    Impatience at the puppy's interference cleared the haze a little from  Lad's brain and eyes. He halted in his shaky walk and stared,  dumfounded. This dog which greeted him so rapturously was not Wolf. It  was--why, it was--Lady! Oh, it was _Lady!_    \"We've just brought her back to you, old friend,\" the Master was  telling him. \"We went over for her in the car this morning. She's all  well again, and----\"    But Lad did not hear. All he realized--all he wanted to realize--was  that his mate was ecstatically nipping one of his ears to make him  romp with her.    It was a sharp nip; and it hurt like the very mischief.    Lad loved to have it hurt.

Farther on a multitude of irrigation ditches have turned a plain of  dry friable soil into a plain of mud, through which it was difficult  to struggle. Then came a grove of palms, and then the town or village  of Kizil Robat (Red Shrine), with its _imamzada_, whose reputation for  sanctity is indicated by the immense number of graves which surround  it. The walls of this decayed and wretched town are of thick layers of  hardened but now crumbling earth, and on the east side there is an old  gateway of burned brick. There are said to be 400 houses, which at the  lowest computation would mean a population of 2000, but inhabited  houses and ruins are so jumbled up together that one cannot form any  estimate.    So woe-begone and miserable a place I never saw, and the dirt is  appalling even in this dry weather. In spring the alleys of the town  are impassable, and people whose business calls them out cross from  roof to roof on boards. Pools of filthy water, loathsome ditches with  broad margins of trodden slime full of abominations, ruins of houses,  yards foul with refuse, half-clothed and wholly unwashed children, men  of low aspect standing in melancholy groups, a well-built brick bazar,  in which Manchester cottons are prominent, more mud and dirt, some  ruinous caravanserais, and near the extremity of the town or village  is the horrible one in which I now am, said to be the best, with a  yard a foot deep in manure and slush, in the midst of which is the  well, and around which are stables and recesses for travellers.    At first it seemed likely that I should fall so low as to occupy one  of these, but careful investigation revealed a ruinous stair leading  to the roof, up which were two rooms, or shall I say three?--an arched  recess such as coals are kept in, a small room within it, and a low  wood hole. The open arch, with a _mangel_ or iron pan of charcoal,  serves as the \"parlour\" this January night, M---- occupies the wood  hole, and I the one room, into which Hadji, with many groans and  ejaculations of \"_Ya Allah!_\" has brought up the essential parts of my  baggage. The evening is gray and threatening, and low, snow-covered  hills look grimly over the bare brown plain which lies outside this  mournful place.    _Khannikin, Jan. 15._--This has been a hard, rough march, but there  will be many worse ahead. Rain fell heavily all night, converting the  yard into a lake of trampled mud, and seemed so likely to continue  that it was difficult to decide whether to march or halt. Miserable it  was to see mules standing to be loaded, up to their knees in mud,  bales of tents and bedding lying in the quagmire, and the shivering  Indian servants up to their knees in the swamp. In rain steadily  falling the twelve animals were loaded, and after the usual scrimmage  at starting, in which the _bakhsheesh_ is often thrown back at us, we  rode out into a sea of deep mud, through which the mules, struggling  and floundering, got on about a mile an hour.    After a time we came to gravel, then relapsed into deep alluvial soil,  which now means deep mire, then a low range of gravelly hills on  which a few sheep and camels were browsing on artemisia and other  aromatic herbs gave a temporary respite, then again we floundered  through miles of mud, succeeded by miles of gravel and stones. The  rain fell in torrents, and there was a cold strong wind to fight  against. There was that amount of general unpropitiousness which is  highly stimulating and inspiriting.    When noon came, there was not a rock or bush for shelter, and turning  our backs to the storm we ate our lunch in our saddles. There was  nothing to look at but brown gravel, or brown mud, brooded over by a  gray mist. So we tramped on, hour after hour, in single file, the  _zaptieh_ leading, everything but his gun muffled in his brown _abba_,  splashing through mud and water, the water pouring from my hat and  cloak, the six woollen thicknesses of my mask dripping, seeing neither  villages nor caravans, for caravans of goods do not travel in such  rain as this. Then over a slope we went down into a lake of mud, where  the _aide-de-camp_ of the Governor of Khannikin, in a fez and military  frock-coat and trousers, with a number of Bashi Bazouks or irregulars,  met M---- with courtesies and an invitation.    From the top of the next slope there was a view of Khannikin, a  considerable-looking town among groves of palms and other trees. Then  came a worse sea of mud, and a rudely cobbled causeway, so horrible  that it diverted us back into the mud, which was so bottomless that it  drove us back to the causeway, and the causeway back to the mud, the  rain all the time coming down in sheets. This causeway, without  improvement, is carried through Khannikin, a town with narrow blind  alleys, upon which foul courtyards open, often so foul as to render  the recent ravages of cholera (if science speaks truly) a matter of  necessity. The mud and water in these alleys was up to the knees of  the mules. Not a creature was in the streets. No amount of curiosity,  even regarding the rare sight of a Frank woman, could make people face  the storm in flimsy cotton clothes.    Where the road turns to the bridge a line of irregular infantry was  drawn up, poorly dressed, soaked creatures, standing in chilly mud up  to their ankles, in soaked boots reaching to their knees. These joined  and headed the cavalcade, and I fell humbly in the rear. Poor fellows!  To keep step was impossible when it was hard work to drag their feet  out of the mire, and they carried their rifles anyhow. It was a  grotesque procession. A trim officer, forlorn infantry, wild-looking  Bashi Bazouks, Europeans in stout mackintoshes splashed with mud from  head to foot, mules rolling under their bespattered loads, and a  _posse_ of servants and orderlies crouching on the top of baggage,  muffled up to the eyes, the asses which carry the _katirgis_ and their  equipments far behind, staggering and nearly done up, for the march of  seventeen miles had taken eight and a half hours.    An abrupt turn in the causeway leads to the Holwan, a tributary of the  Diyalah, a broad, rapid stream, over which the enterprise of a Persian  has thrown a really fine brick bridge of thirteen heavily-buttressed  arches, which connects the two parts of the town and gives some  dignity and picturesqueness to what would otherwise be mean. On the  left bank of the Holwan are the barracks, the governor's house, some  large caravanserais, the Custom-house, and a quarantine station,  quarantine having just been imposed on all arrivals from Persia,  giving travel and commerce a decided check.    After half a mile of slush on the river bank we entered by a handsome  gateway a nearly flooded courtyard, and the Governor's house  hospitably engorged the whole party.    The fully-laden mules stuck in the mud a few miles off, and did not  come in for two hours, and in spite of covers everything not done up  in waterproof was very wet. The servants looked most miserable, and  complained of chills and rheumatism, and one of the orderlies is  really ill. We cannot move till the storm is over.    The rain falls heavily still, the river is rising, the alleys are two  feet deep in slush, travel is absolutely suspended, and it is not  possible without necessity to go out. It was well indeed that we  decided to leave the shelterless shelter of Kizil Robat. Nothing can  exceed the wretchedness of Khannikin or any Turkish town in such rain  as this. Would that one could think that it would be washed, but as  there are no channels to carry off the water it simply lodges and  stagnates in every depression, and all the accumulations of summer  refuse slide into these abominable pools, and the foul dust, a foot  deep, becomes mud far deeper; buried things are half uncovered;  torrents, not to be avoided, pour from every roof, the courtyards are  knee-deep in mud, the cows stand disconsolately in mud; not a woman is  to be seen, the few men driven forth by the merciless exigences of  business show nothing but one eye, and with \"loins girded\" and big  staffs move wearily, stumbling and plunging in the mire.    After some hours the flat mud roofs begin to leak, water finds out  every weak place in the walls, the bazars, only half open for a short  time in the day, are deserted by buyers, and the patient sellers  crouch over _mangels_, muffled up in sheepskins, the caravanserais are  crammed and quarrelsome; the price of fodder and fuel rises, and every  one is drowned in rain and wretchedness. Even here, owing to the  scarcity of fuel, nothing can be dried; the servants in their damp  clothes come in steaming; Hadji in his misshapen \"jack-boots,\" which  he asserts he cannot take off, spreads fresh mud over the carpets  whenever he enters; I shift from place to place to avoid the drip from  the roof--and still the rain comes down with unabated vigour!

LETTER III (_Continued_)      The house consists of two courtyards, with buildings round them. The  larger and handsomer is the _haram_ or women's house, which is  strictly enclosed, has no exterior windows, and its one door into the  men's house is guarded by a very ancient eunuch. The courtyard of this  house is surrounded partly by arched _serdabs_, with green lattice  fronts, and partly by a kitchen, bakery, wood-house, _hammam_ or hot  bath, and the servants' quarters. The _haram_ has a similar  arrangement on the lower floor. A broad balcony, reached by a steep  and narrow stair, runs round three sides of the upper part of this  house. There are very few rooms, and some of them are used for storing  fruit. The wet baggage is mostly"]]]
