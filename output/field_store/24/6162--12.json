Cooper was an elemental  man, and he comprehended, by means of something deeper than mere  artistic instinct, the feelings of elemental humanity in the presence  of the wide ocean or of the deep woods. He is as healthy and sane as  Fielding, and he possesses an additional quality which all of the purely  English novelists lack. It was the result of his youthful sojourn in  the wilderness. Let us call it the survival in him of an aboriginal  imagination. Cooper reminds one somehow of a moose--an ungraceful  creature perhaps, but indubitably big, as many a hunter has suddenly  realized when he has come unexpectedly upon a moose that whirled to face  him in the twilight silence of a northern wood.    Something of this far-off and gigantic primitivism inheres also in the  poetry of William Cullen Bryant. His portrait, with the sweeping white  beard and the dark folds of the cloak, suggests the Bard as the Druids  might have known him. But in the eighteen-thirties and forties, Mr.  Bryant's alert, clean-shaven face, and energetic gait as he strode down  Broadway to the \"Evening Post\" office, suggested little more than a  vigorous and somewhat radical editor of an increasingly prosperous  Democratic newspaper. There was nothing of the Fringed Gentian or Yellow  Violet about him. Like so many of the Knickerbockers, Bryant was an  immigrant to New York; in fact, none of her adopted men of letters  have represented so perfectly the inherited traits of the New England  Puritan. To understand his long, and honorable public life it is  necessary to know something of the city of his choice, but to enter  into the spirit of his poetry one must go back to the hills of western  Massachusetts.    Bryant had a right to his cold-weather mind. He came from Mayflower  stock. His father, Dr. Peter Bryant of Cummington, was a sound country  physician, with liberal preferences in theology, Federalist views in  politics, and a library of seven hundred volumes, rich in poetry. The  poet's mother records his birth in her diary in terse words which have  the true Spartan tang: \"Nov. 3, 1794. Stormy, wind N. E. Churned. Seven  in the evening a son born.\" Two days later the November wind shifted.  \"Nov. 5, 1794. Clear, wind N. W. Made Austin a coat. Sat up all day.  Went into the kitchen.\" The baby, it appears, had an abnormally large  head and was dipped, day after day, in rude hydropathy, into an icy  spring. A precocious childhood was followed by a stern, somewhat  unhappy, but aspiring boyhood. The little fellow, lying prone with his  brothers before the firelight of the kitchen, reading English poetry  from his father's library, used to pray that he too might become a poet.  At thirteen he produced a satire on Jefferson, \"The Embargo,\" which his  proud Federalist father printed at Boston in 1808. The youth had nearly  one year at Williams College, over the mountain ranges to the west. He  wished to continue his education at Yale, but his father had no money  for this greater venture, and the son remained at home. There, in the  autumn of 1811, on the bleak hills, he composed the first draft of  \"Thanatopsis.\" He was seventeen, and he had been reading Blair's \"Grave\"  and the poems of the consumptive Henry Kirke White. He hid his verses  in a drawer, and five years later his father found them, shed tears  over them, and sent them to the \"North American Review,\" where they were  published in September, 1817.    In the meantime the young man had studied law, though with dislike of  it, and with the confession that he sometimes read \"The Lyrical Ballads\"  when he might have been reading Blackstone. One December afternoon in  1815, he was walking from Cummington to Plainfield--aged twenty-one,  and looking for a place in which to settle as a lawyer. Across the vivid  sunset flew a black duck, as solitary and homeless as himself. The bird  seemed an image of his own soul, \"lone wandering but not lost.\" Before  he slept that night he had composed the poem \"To a Waterfowl.\" No more  authentic inspiration ever visited a poet, and though Bryant wrote verse  for more than sixty years after that crimson sky had paled into  chill December twilight, his lines never again vibrated with such  communicative passion.    Bryant's ensuing career revealed the steady purpose, the stoicism,  the reticence of the Puritan. It was highly successful, judged even by  material standards. \"Thanatopsis\" had been instantly regarded in 1817  as the finest poem yet produced in America. The author was invited to  contribute to the \"North American Review\" an essay on American poetry,  and this, like all of Bryant's prose work, was admirably written. He  delivered his Harvard Phi Beta Kappa poem, \"The Ages,\" in 1821, the  year of Emerson's graduation. After a brief practice of the law in Great  Barrington, he entered in 1826 into the unpromising field of journalism  in New York. While other young Knickerbockers wasted their literary  strength on trifles and dissipated their moral energies, Bryant held  steadily to his daily task. His life in town was sternly ascetic, but he  allowed himself long walks in the country, and he continued to meditate  a somewhat thankless Muse. In 1832 he visited his brothers on the  Illinois prairies, and stopped one day to chat with a \"tall awkward  uncouth lad\" of racy conversational powers, who was leading his company  of volunteers into the Black Hawk War. The two men were destined to  meet again in 1860, when Bryant presided at that Cooper Union address of  Lincoln's which revealed to New York and to the country that the former  captain of volunteers was now a king of men. Lincoln was embarrassed on  that occasion, it is said, by Bryant's fastidious, dignified presence.  Not so Nathaniel Hawthorne, who had seen the poet in Rome, two years  before. \"There was a weary look in his face,\" wrote Hawthorne, \"as if  he were tired of seeing things and doing things....He uttered neither  passion nor poetry, but excellent good sense, and accurate information,  on whatever subject transpired; a very pleasant man to associate with,  but rather cold, I should imagine, if one should seek to touch his heart  with one's own.\" Such was the impression Bryant made upon less gifted  men than Hawthorne, as he lived out his long and useful life in the  Knickerbocker city. Toward the close of it he was in great demand for  public occasions; and it was after delivering a speech dedicating a  statue to Mazzini in Central Park in 1878, when Bryant was eighty-four,  that a fit of dizziness caused a fall which proved fatal to the  venerable poet. It was just seventy years since Dr. Peter Bryant had  published his boy's verses on \"The Embargo.\"    Although Bryant's poetry has never roused any vociferous excitement, it  has enduring qualities. The spiritual preoccupations of many a voiceless  generation of New England Puritans found a tongue at last in this  late-born son of theirs. The determining mood of his best poems, from  boyhood to old age, was precisely that thought of transiency, \"the  eternal flow of things,\" which colored the imaginations of the  first colonists. This is the central motive of \"Thanatopsis,\" \"To a  Waterfowl,\" \"The Rivulet,\" \"A Forest Hymn,\" \"An Evening Revery,\" \"The  Crowded Street,\" \"The Flood of Years.\" All of these tell the same story  of endless change and of endless abiding, of varying eddies in the same  mighty stream of human existence. Bryant faced the thought as calmly,  as majestically, at seventeen as when he wrote \"The Flood of Years\" at  eighty-two. He is a master of description, though he has slight gift  for narrative or drama, and he rarely sounds the clear lyric note. But  everywhere in his verse there is that cold purity of the winter hills  in Western Massachusetts, something austere and elemental which reaches  kindred spirits below the surface on which intellect and passion have  their play, something more primitive, indeed, than human intellect or  passion and belonging to another mode of being, something \"rock-ribbed  and ancient as the sun.\"    A picture of the Knickerbocker era is not complete without its portraits  of the minor figures in the literary life of New York up to the time  of the Civil War. But the scope of the present volume does not permit  sketches of Paulding and Verplanck, of Halleck and his friend Drake,  of N. P. Willis and Morris and Woodworth. Some of these are today only  \"single-poem\" men, like Payne, the author of \"Home Sweet Home,\" just as  Key, the author of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" is today a \"single-poem\"  man of an earlier generation. Their names will be found in such limbos  of the dead as Griswold's \"Poets and Poetry of America\" and Poe's  \"Literati.\" They knew \"the town\" in their day, and pleased its very  easily pleased taste. The short-lived literary magazines of the  eighteen-forties gave them their hour of glory. As representatives of  passing phases of the literary history of New York their careers are  not without sentimental interest, but few of them spoke to or for the  country as a whole. Two figures, indeed, stand out in sharp contrast  with those habitual strollers on Broadway and frequenters of literary  gatherings, though each of them was for a while a part of Knickerbocker  New York. To all appearances they were only two more Bohemians like the  rest, but the curiosity of the twentieth century sets them apart from  their forgotten contemporaries. They are two of the unluckiest--and yet  luckiest--authors who ever tried to sell a manuscript along Broadway.  One of them is Edgar Allan Poe and the other is Walt Whitman. They shall  have a chapter to themselves.    But before turning to that chapter, we must look back to New England  once more and observe the blossoming-time of its ancient commonwealths.  During the thirty years preceding the Civil War New England awoke to  a new"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34110"],[0,"Deadfalls and Snares (#13)"],[1,"water at the entrance to the den and is fastened there. A  muskrat in entering or leaving the den is sure to enter the trap.    The animal, of course, could gnaw out, but will drown before it has  time to accomplish this. Several rats are often taken, where they are  numerous, in a night. Traps of this kind can be used to best  advantage in lakes and ponds or where the height of the stream does  not vary much. If they are set along creeks and rivers you want to  fasten them securely or take them up before heavy rains, as they are  almost sure to be washed away.      * * *    I see in a recent number where George Walker wanted some one to tell  through H-T-T how to make box trap to catch muskrat. Here is a good  way:    First take four boards 36 inches long, nail together leaving both  ends open. Next a small gate, consisting of a square piece of wood  supplied with a few stiff wires is then pivoted inside of each  opening so as to work freely and fall easily when raised. The bait is  fastened inside the center of the box. The animal in quest of the  bait finds an easy entrance, as the wires lift at slight pressure,  but the exit after the gate has closed is so difficult that escape is  almost beyond question. To insure further strength it is advisable to  connect the lower ends of the wires by a cross piece of fine wire  twisted about each. If you have good luck you can catch two and three  in this trap each night. Set in two or three inches of water where  muskrat frequents, or set in skunk dens.        CHAPTER XIX.    THE COOP TRAP.    This trap is used with great success for catching wild turkey,  pheasants, quail and other feathered game. In some states the law  forbids the use of this and similar traps.    The trap is built like an ordinary rail pen. In fact, some use small  rails when constructing this trap for wild turkey, while others build  of small straight poles. The pen is usually six feet or more square  and about three high. The \"coop\" is stronger if drawn in from bottom  to top (see illustration). The top must be covered and weighted.    A ditch is now dug about a foot wide. This ditch should begin about  three feet from coop and lead within. Corn or other grain is  scattered on the outside and in the trench leading into the coop. On  the inside considerable should be scattered in the leaves and small  but short twigs.    The turkeys once on the inside will eat the grain and scratch among  the leaves which generally partly fill the trench and as the birds  are usually looking up, when not eating, they do not think of the  trench thru which they entered.    The same trap will catch quail, but of course is built much smaller.  About three feet square being large enough and a foot high is  sufficient.  Some have built quail coops out of cornstalks and report  catches.      [Illustration: THE COOP TRAP.]    The quail coop should have the ditch leading to the inside the same  as described for turkey. Of course the ditch should be much  smaller--only large enough for one bird to enter at a time. On the  inside of coop it is a good idea to lay a board six inches or wider  over the ditch. The bait should be wheat or other small grain or  seeds that the birds like. Scatter thinly on the outside and in the  trench, but on the inside place more liberally. Chaff or leaves  should be placed on the inside so that the birds in scratching for  the grain will partly fill up the hole thru which they came.    Quail, turkey and other feathered game once on the inside and after  eating the bait never think of going down into the ditch and out, but  walk round and round the coop looking thru the chinks and trying to  escape.    The largest catches are made by baiting where the birds frequent for  some days or even weeks before trying to make a catch. It is well to  make the coops long in advance so that the birds will be accustomed  to them, especially wild turkey.    These traps are some times used with the figure 4 trigger, but when  thus set seldom more than one or two birds are caught at a time.        CHAPTER XX.    THE PIT TRAP.    This method of catching game and fur bearing animals is not much  used, as the labor in connection with making a pit trap is  considerable. The method, however, is an excellent one for taking  some of the larger animals, especially when they are wanted for  parks, menageries, etc., uninjured.    The pit should be several feet deep and bait placed as shown. Another  way is to cover the top with rotten limbs, leaves, etc., and place  the bait on this. The animal in trying to secure the bait breaks  thru.    The dirt from the pit should be removed in baskets. Catches are made  by digging a pit across animal runways or trails. When the ground is  not frozen or during rainy weather it is well to place a board  several inches wide at top. The animal in going over its usual trail  steps upon the frail covering and falls thru.    While the pit trap is mostly used for capturing large game, it can be  used to advantage for taking many of the smaller fur bearers.    Where muskrat are numerous, instead of digging a pit, secure a box  about three feet deep. The width and length make no difference. Place  a few flat rocks in the bottom and place in the water where rats  frequent. Make the box solid. The box must be water tight. The weight  should bring the top of box to within a few inches of water. A couple  of boards or chunks should be so placed that the rats will climb up  them and to the box along the edge of which the bait is placed.      [Illustration: THE PIT TRAP.]    The pit trap can be used where skunk and other animals frequent. Bait  the place for some days before the pit is dug.    If the pit is to be used without bait, then find the runways of the  animal and dig the pit. While some animals may not be shy, if a  little fresh dirt is lying around, yet it is best to be very careful  and carry all earth taken out of pit a few rods to one side. Pits of  this kind should be several feet deep.    The success the hunter or trapper has in using this method will  depend largely upon his knowledge of the game he is after. Unless the  animal or animals are wanted alive, the work to make a pit is too  great and the chances of a catch never certain. This way is not  practicable under ordinary circumstances, yet where the game is  wanted alive and sound, is worth trying.        CHAPTER XXI.    NUMBER OF TRAPS.    In some localities there are not many dens and trappers make use of  about all when trapping that section, but in other parts of the  country dens are so numerous that to place a trap at each is  impossible. In states where groundhogs (woodchucks), are numerous  there are often a hundred or more dens along a single bluff or rocky  bank. To have enough steel traps to set one at each is something few  trappers do, yet two or three deadfalls in connection with a line of  steel traps is all that is necessary and the trapper can move on to  the next bluff where dens are numerous and set another trap or two.  As a rule it is where there are many dens, close together, that  deadfalls make the best catches, yet when you find a good den  anywhere, set or construct a deadfall.    All trappers have noticed when tracking animals in the snow that they  visit nearly every den along their route, not always going in but  just sticking their head in. When thus investigating, the animal  smells the bait and is hungry (as nine times out of ten the animal is  hunting something to eat), and if your trap is set properly you are  reasonably sure to make a catch.    In the North, Canada, Alaska and some of the states on the Canadian  border where trapping is made a business, it is no uncommon thing for  one man to have as many as one hundred and fifty traps and some have  out twice that many, or three hundred. Marten trappers in the  trackless forests often blaze out a route fifty or more miles in  length, building shelters along the line where nights are spent.    The trapper who only spends a few hours each day at trapping and  lives in thickly settled districts will find that it is hard for him  to locate suitable places perhaps for more than thirty to fifty  traps, yet if these will be looked at properly during the season the  catch will justify the time and labor in building.    The number of deadfalls and snares that each trapper should construct  in his section must largely be determined by himself, depending upon  how large a territory he has to trap over without running into other  trappers' grounds. It will be little use to build traps where there  are other trappers as trouble will occur, traps may be torn to  pieces, etc. Yet there are many good places to build traps in your  immediate locality no doubt. If there are any creeks near and woods  along the banks you will find good places at both creek and in the  woods. If in sections where there is no forest, like some western  states, deadfalls trapping may be difficult from the fact that there  is nothing to build them with.    In such cases the portable traps, (described elsewhere) in this book,  can probably be used to advantage, but best of all in such places is  steel traps.    The number of deadfalls and snares that a trapper can attend to is  large, from the fact that the game is killed and as the weather is  usually cold, the traps need not be looked at only about twice each  week.    In the North, many trappers have such long lines that they do not get  over them only once a week. The trouble where deadfalls are only  looked at once in seven days is that other animals are apt to find  the game and may injure the fur, or even destroy the pelt.    Where snares with spring pole attachment are used, and the weather is  cold, the trapper need not make the rounds only once a week, as all  animals will be suspended in the air and out of the reach of flesh  eaters.    South of 40 degrees where the weather is not severe, it is policy to  look at "]]]
