The length of step is about twelve or fourteen  inches, and the foot prints of an average sized fox will measure  about one and a half inches in length.    The track of the gray fox is rounder and more like that of a cat.    Some hunters claim that they can distinguish the track of the male  fox from that of the female, the footprints of the female being  smaller and a trifle narrower in proportion.    There is no difference in the footprints of the black, silver, cross  and red foxes.      [Illustration: The Coyote, or Prairie Wolf.]        CHAPTER XI.    THE WOLF.    The Wolf belongs to the dog family and is found throughout the  greater part of North America, also in Europe and Asia, and parts of  South America. There are many varieties, varying greatly in size and  color, but there are probably only two distinct species, namely, the  timber wolf and the prairie wolf, commonly called the coyote. Of the  timber wolves, we have in this country, the following varieties; the  small dark grey or black wolf of Florida and southeastern United  States, the red wolf or southern Texas; the brindled wolf of Mexico,  the light grey wolf of the central plains region; the dark grey wolf  of eastern Canada; the white wolf of northern Canada and Alaska and  the large black or dusky wolf of the northwest coast region.    Of the smaller prairie wolf, there are also several varieties, they  being found throughout the prairie regions of the United States and  Canada, extending westward to the foot of the Rocky mountains, and  also occurring west of the mountains, in the states of Oregon and  Washington. To the trappers and the western people in general, these  two species are commonly known as the wolf and the coyote, pronounced  ki'yote. As a rule, the varieties of timber wolves found in the far  north are larger than those of the south. While they are found in  fair numbers in most parts of the regions mentioned, the prairie wolf  or coyote is far more abundant in the sections lying east of the  mountains; there being, in most localities, probably fifty coyotes  for one wolf.    Of the large species, the common grey wolf, of the western stock  region, is probably most abundant, and the most destructive to stock  and game. The grey wolf varies considerably in size, the largest  specimens weighing sometimes more than one hundred pounds. The fur is  long and heavy and good prime skins bring usually from two to five  dollars each. In former times, when the buffalo was abundant on the  plains, they formed the chief food of the wolf, but since the buffalo  has become an animal of the past, the wolves depend on stock for  food. They are very destructive to cattle, horses, hogs, goats, etc.  Occasionally a herd of sheep is raided, but this is of rare  occurrence, as the sheep are always guarded by the herders.    In the north where there is little or no stock raised, they prey on  game of almost all kinds, being very destructive to deer and even  killing moose, at times. They also follow the herds of cattle, which  range in the mountains during the summer and in winter are found in  the foot hills. The coyote preys on young deer and antelope and on  small game, such as rabbits, prairie dogs, sage hens and badgers.  They are very destructive to sheep, and many of them follow the sheep  when they are driven into the mountains in summer.    The breeding season of the grey wolf varies considerably, some being  born in the summer, but the majority are born in March and April. The  mating season comes mainly in January and February. There are usually  from five to eleven in a litter. They breed in the foot hills and bad  lands, in holes in the buttes and rim-rock and sometimes in enlarged  badger dens. The breeding season of the coyote generally comes later  than that of the grey wolf; most of them being born in April. They  also breed in natural excavations in the rocks.    Wolves are great ramblers and range over a large section of country.  Like all other animals of rambling habits, they have a regular route  of travel, and while they vary somewhat from the route, you may be  certain to find them using the same passes through the hills, and the  same route across a flat. However, when in pursuit of game, they go  far out of their course.    Almost all of the states where wolves are found, as well as some of  the provinces of Canada, pay a bounty on wolves and coyotes. The  bounties are different, in different states and so also, are the  bounty laws, and the methods of obtaining the bounty money. Usually  the skin and head, or part of the head, or the feet and bones of the  legs, must be produced, in order to obtain this bounty.    Besides the state bounty, the ranchmen often offer an additional sum,  which in most cases, amounts to far more than the state bounty.  Sometimes, when some particular band of wolves become especially  destructive to stock, the bounties offered for these wolves amount to  a fancy sum of money. On one particularly destructive wolf, in the  state of Wyoming, bounties were offered amounting to five hundred  dollars. Of course such instances are rare, but in most cases, the  bounties are sufficient to make wolf trapping profitable, even in the  summer, when the fur is of no value.    For trapping grey wolves, I recommend only the Newhouse trap. A  special trap is manufactured, for grey wolves, No. 4 1/2. It has an  eight-inch spread of jaws and a five foot chain, fitted with a heavy  iron drag, and with chain, complete weighs nine pounds. However, many  trappers consider this trap too heavy and the No. 4 Newhouse trap is  used more than any other. When these traps are used, they should be  fitted with a heavy chain of suitable length, and a pronged drag. The  length and style of chain needed will depend much on the method of  setting. If the trap is to be staked, I think the ordinary length of  chain is best but unless there are two or more traps used in a  setting, I would not advise staking the trap.    Some trappers do not use a drag, but wire a heavy stone to the end of  the chain. The stone should be fastened securely, for it will be  handled pretty roughly, if a wolf gets in the trap. For the coyote, I  recommend the Nos. 3 and 4 Newhouse, the 3 and 4 Hawley & Norton, the  No. 4 Oneida Jump trap and Nos. 3 and 4 Victor. They should also, be  fitted with special chains, unless the traps are to be staked. Good  hard-wood stakes should be provided and they should be about fifteen  inches long, unless the ground is very soft, in which case they  should be longer. As good hard-wood is scarce in many parts of the  west, it will sometimes be best to have iron picket pins, made by the  local blacksmith.    The bait for the grey wolf should be strictly fresh, for if food is  plenty, they are pretty particular. Any of their favorite foods may  be used for bait. For the coyote, horse or sheep is probably best,  but prairie dogs, rabbits (both sage and jack rabbits), sage hens,  badgers, etc., make good bait. When using small animals for bait,  they should never be skinned, for that makes the animal suspicious.    Many different kinds of scent have been used for wolves. Some have  been used successfully but in using scent, one should also use good  sound judgment, or he will only make the animal suspicious, and  harder to trap. Beaver castor and Chinese musk are mildly attractive.  Siberian musk is very attractive to both the grey wolf and the  coyote. Assafoetida used alone, is worthless, but may be mixed with  other scents, to advantage. The urine of the wolf, bottled and kept  until it has become rancid, is a very good scent, and the sexual  organs of the female, taken when in heat, added to the urine, makes  it far more attractive to the male. This scent is most successful  during the mating season and should be used without bait.    A very effective scent and one that is much used is made as follows:  Place half a pound of raw beef or venison in a wide mouthed bottle  and let it stand from two to six weeks, or longer, or until it is  thoroughly decayed and the odor has become as offensive as possible.  If the meat is chopped fine, it will aid decomposition. When  thoroughly decayed, add a quart of some liquid animal oil--prairie  dog oil is probably best, and one-half ounce of assafoetida,  dissolved in alcohol and one ounce of tincture of Siberian musk, or  if this can not be obtained, an ounce of pulverized beaver castor or  one ounce of the common musk used as perfumery. Mix thoroughly and  bottle securely until ready for use. This scent is attractive to both  the wolf and the coyote, also to cattle and horses and in using it  the traps should only be set in places where they are not likely to  be disturbed by stock.      [Illustration: Scent Set for Wolf.]    This method of trapping, as well as the above scent formula is given  by Mr. Vernon Bailey, who made an investigation of the wolf trouble  in the interests of the Biological Survey and the department of  Forest Service.    \"The best anchor for a wolf trap is a stone drag of 30 or 40 pounds  weight, to which the trap is securely wired. A long, oval stone is  best, but a triangular or square stone can be securely wired.    The trap, stone and chain should be buried out of sight close to a  runway, where the wolves follow a trail or road, cross a narrow pass,  or visit a carcass, with the trap nearest the runway and when  covered, flush with the surface of the ground. To keep the dirt from  clogging under the pan, the pan and jaws should be covered with a  clean, oval shaped paper, and over this should be sprinkled fine  earth until the surface is smooth and all traces of paper and trap,  have been concealed. The surface of the ground and the surroundings  should appear as nearly as possible, undisturbed. The dust may be  made to look natural again by sprinkling with water.

All day long he lay  there gazing up into the tree, and when he was called for supper he  refused, saying that he was not hungry, and for them not to bother him,  as he would soon get up and go to bed. Far into the night he lay thus,  and when he tried to arise he could not, as a small oak tree grew  through the center of his body and held him fast to the ground.    In the morning when the family awoke they found the girl had  disappeared, and on going outside the sister discovered her brother held  fast to the earth by an oak tree which grew very rapidly. In vain were  the best medicine men of the tribe sent for. Their medicine was of no  avail. They said: \"If the tree is cut down the young man will die.\"    The sister was wild with grief, and extending her hands to the sun, she  cried: \"Great Spirit, relieve my suffering brother. Any one who releases  him I will marry, be he young, old, homely or deformed.\"    Several days after the young man had met with the mishap, there came to  the tent a very tall man, who had a bright light encircling his body.  \"Where is the girl who promised to marry any one who would release  her brother?\" \"I am the one,\" said the young man's sister. \"I am the  all-powerful lightning and thunder. I see all things and can kill at one  stroke a whole tribe. When I make my voice heard the rocks shake loose  and go rattling down the hillsides. The brave warriors cower shivering  under some shelter at the sound of my voice. The girl whom you had  adopted as your sister was a sorceress. She bewitched your brother  because he would not let her make love to him. On my way here I met her  traveling towards the west, and knowing what she had done, I struck her  with one of my blazing swords, and she lies there now a heap of ashes. I  will now release your brother.\"    So saying he placed his hand on the tree and instantly it crumbled to  ashes. The young man arose, and thanked his deliverer.    Then they saw a great black cloud approaching, and the man said: \"Make  ready, we shall go home on that cloud.\" As the cloud approached near to  the man who stood with his bride, it suddenly lowered and enveloped them  and with a great roar and amidst flashes of lightning and loud peals of  thunder the girl ascended and disappeared into the west with her Thunder  and Lightning husband.              STORY OF THE TWO YOUNG FRIENDS    There were once in a very large Indian camp two little boys who were  fast friends. One of the boys, \"Chaske\" (meaning first born), was the  son of a very rich family, and was always dressed in the finest of  clothes of Indian costume. The other boy, \"Hake\" (meaning last  born), was an orphan and lived with his old grandmother, who was very  destitute, and consequently could not dress the boy in fine raiment.  So poorly was the boy dressed that the boys who had good clothes always  tormented him and would not play in his company.    Chaske did not look at the clothes of any boy whom he chose as a friend,  but mingled with all boys regardless of how they were clad, and would  study their dispositions. The well dressed he found were vain and  conceited. The fairly well dressed he found selfish and spiteful. The  poorly clad he found to be generous and truthful, and from all of them  he chose \"Hake\" for his \"Koda\" (friend). As Chaske was the son of the  leading war chief he was very much sought after by the rest of the boys,  each one trying to gain the honor of being chosen for the friend and  companion of the great chief's son; but, as I have before said, Chaske  carefully studied them all and finally chose the orphan Hake.    It was a lucky day for Hake when he was chosen for the friend and  companion of Chaske. The orphan boy was taken to the lodge of his  friend's parents and dressed up in fine clothes and moccasins. (When the  Indians' sons claim any one as their friend, the friend thus chosen is  adopted into the family as their own son).    Chaske and Hake were inseparable. Where one was seen the other was not  far distant. They played, hunted, trapped, ate and slept together. They  would spend most of the long summer days hunting in the forests.    Time went on and these two fast friends grew up to be fine specimens of  their tribe. When they became the age to select a sweetheart they would  go together and make love to a girl. Each helping the other to win the  affection of the one of his choice. Chaske loved a girl who was the  daughter of an old medicine man. She was very much courted by the other  young men of the tribe, and many a horse loaded with robes and fine  porcupine work was tied at the medicine man's tepee in offering for the  hand of his daughter, but the horses, laden as when tied there, were  turned loose, signifying that the offer was not accepted.    The girl's choice was Chaske's friend Hake. Although he had never made  love to her for himself, he had always used honeyed words to her and  was always loud in his praises for his friend Chaske. One night the two  friends had been to see the girl, and on their return Chaske was very  quiet, having nothing to say and seemingly in deep study. Always of  a bright, jolly and amiable disposition, his silence and moody spell  grieved his friend very much, and he finally spoke to Chaske, saying:  \"Koda, what has come over you? You who were always so jolly and full of  fun? Your silence makes me grieve for you and I do not know what you are  feeling so downhearted about. Has the girl said anything to you to make  you feel thus?\"    \"Wait, friend,\" said Chaske, \"until morning, and then I will know how to  answer your inquiry. Don't ask me anything more tonight, as my heart is  having a great battle with my brain.\"    Hake bothered his friend no more that night, but he could not sleep. He  kept wondering what \"Pretty Feather\" (the girl whom his friend loved)  could have said to Chaske to bring such a change over him. Hake never  suspected that he himself was the cause of his friend's sorrow, for  never did he have a thought that it was himself that Pretty Feather  loved.    The next morning after they had eaten breakfast, Chaske proposed that  they should go out on the prairies, and see if they would have the good  luck to kill an antelope. Hake went out and got the band of horses, of  which there were over a hundred. They selected the fleetest two in the  herd, and taking their bows and arrows, mounted and rode away towards  the south.    Hake was overjoyed to note the change in his friend. His oldtime jollity  had returned. They rode out about five miles, and scaring up a drove  of antelope they started in hot pursuit, and as their horses were very  fleet of foot soon caught up to the drove, and each singling out his  choice quickly dispatched him with an arrow. They could easily have  killed more of the antelope, but did not want to kill them just for  sport, but for food, and knowing that they had now all that their horses  could pack home, they dismounted and proceeded to dress their kill.    After each had finished packing the kill on his horse, Chaske said:  \"Let us sit down and have a smoke before we start back. Besides, I have  something to tell you which I can tell better sitting still than I can  riding along.\" Hake came and sat down opposite his friend, and while  they smoked Chaske said:    \"My friend, we have been together for the last twenty years and I  have yet the first time to deceive you in any way, and I know I can  truthfully say the same of you. Never have I known you to deceive me nor  tell me an untruth. I have no brothers or sisters. The only brother's  love I know is yours. The only sister's love I will know will be Pretty  Feather's, for brother, last night she told me she loved none but you  and would marry you and you only. So, brother, I am going to take my  antelope to my sister-in-law's tent and deposit it at her door. Then she  will know that her wish will be fulfilled. I thought at first that  you had been playing traitor to me and had been making love to her for  yourself, but when she explained it all to me and begged me to intercede  for her to you, I then knew that I had judged you wrongfully, and that,  together with my lost love, made me so quiet and sorrowful last night.  So now, brother, take the flower of the nation for your wife, and I will  be content to continue through life a lonely bachelor, as never again  can I give any woman the place which Pretty Feather had in my heart.\"    Their pipes being smoked out they mounted their ponies and Chaske  started up in a clear, deep voice the beautiful love song of Pretty  Feather and his friend Hake.    Such is the love between two friends, who claim to be as brothers among  the Indians. Chaske gave up his love of a beautiful woman for a man who  was in fact no relation to him.    Hake said, \"I will do as you say, my friend, but before I can marry the  medicine man's daughter, I will have to go on the warpath and do  some brave deed, and will start in ten days.\" They rode towards home,  planning which direction they would travel, and as it was to be their  first experience on the warpath, they would seek advice from the old  warriors of the tribe.    On their arrival at the village Hake took his kill to their own tent,  while Chaske took his to the tent of the Medicine Man, and deposited it  at the door and rode off towards home.    The mother of Pretty Feather did not know whether to take the offering  or not, but Pretty Feather, seeing by this offering that her most  cherished wish was to be granted, told her mother to take the meat and  cook it and invite the old women of the camp to a feast in honor of the  son-in-law who was soon to keep them furnished with plenty of meat. Hake  and his friend sought out all of the old warriors and gained all the  information they desired. Every evening Hake visited his intended wife  and many happy evenings they spent together.
