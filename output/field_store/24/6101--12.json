On one occasion he was acting in a case with a Jewish solicitor, and it  happened that one of the hostile witnesses also belonged to the same  race. Just as the serjeant was about to examine him, the solicitor  whispered in Ballantine's ear: \"Ask him as your first question, if he  isn't a Jew.\"--\"Why, but you're a Jew yourself,\" said the serjeant in  some surprise. \"Never mind, never mind,\" replied the little solicitor  eagerly. \"Please do--just to prejudice the jury.\"           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: JOHN ROMILLY, BARON ROMILLY, MASTER OF THE ROLLS.]    No collection of the wit and humour of the Bar would be complete without  some specimens of Sir Frank Lockwood's racy sayings. From Mr. Augustine  Birrell's _Life of Lockwood_ we quote the following:    \"A tale is attached to Lockwood's first brief. It was on a petition to  the Master of the Rolls for payment out of Court of a sum of money; and  Lockwood appeared for an official liquidator of a company whose consent  had to be obtained before the Court would part with the fund. Lockwood  was instructed to consent, and his reward was to be three guineas on the  brief and one guinea for consultation. The petition came on in due  course before Lord Romilly, and was made plain to him by counsel for the  petitioner, and still a little plainer by counsel for the principal  respondent.    \"Then up rose Lockwood, an imposing figure, and indicated his appearance  in the case.    \"'What brings _you_ here?' said Lord Romilly, meaning, I presume, 'Why  need I listen to you?'    \"Lockwood looking puzzled, Lord Romilly added a little testily, 'What do  you come here for?'    \"The answer was immediate, unexpected, and, accompanied as it was by a  dramatic glance at the outside of his brief, as if to refresh his  memory, triumphant, 'Three and one, my lord!'\"    \"The following letter is to Mrs. Atkinson:             1 HARE COURT, TEMPLE, E.C., LONDON.               _September 18, '72._         MY DEAR LOO,--I trust it is well with yourself, John, and the       childer.... It is an off-day. We are resting on our legal oars       after a prolonged and determined struggle yesterday. Know!       that near our native hamlet is the level of Hatfield Chase,       whereon are numerous drains. Our drain (speaking from the       Corporation of Hatfield Chase point of view) we have stopped,       for our own purposes. Consequently, the adjacent lands have       been flooded, are flooded, and will continue to be flooded.       The landed gentry wish us to remove our dam, saying that if we       don't they won't be worth a d--n. We answer that we don't care       a d--n.         This interesting case has been simmering in the law-courts       since 1820. The landed gentry got a verdict in their favour at       the last Lincoln Assizes, but find themselves little the       better, as we have appealed, and our dam still reigns       triumphant. Yesterday an application was made to the judge to       order our dam to be removed. In the absence of Mellor, I       donned my forensic armour and did battle for the Corporation.       After two hours' hard fighting, we adjourned for a week; in       the meantime the floods may rise, and the winds blow. The       farmers yelled with rage when they heard that the dam had got       a week's respite. I rather fancy that they will yell louder on       Tuesday, as I hope to win another bloodless victory. It is a       pretty wanton sport, the cream of the joke being that the dam       is no good to us or to anybody else, and we have no real       objection to urge against its removal, excepting that such a       measure would be informal, and contrary to the law as laid       down some hundred years ago by an old gentleman who never       heard of a steam-engine, and who would have fainted at the       sight of a telegraph post. As we have the most money on our       side, I trust we shall win in the end. None of this useful       substance, however, comes my way, as it is Mellor's work. But       I hope to reap some advantage from it, both as to experience       and introduction. I make no apology for troubling you with       this long narration. I wish it to sink into your mind, and       into that of your good husband. Let it be a warning to you and       yours. And never by any chance become involved in any       difficulties which will bring you into a court of law of       higher jurisdiction than a police court. An occasional 'drunk       and disorderly' will do you no harm, and only cost you 5_s._       Beyond a little indulgence of this kind--beware! In all       probability I shall be in the North in a few weeks. Sessions       commence next month. I will write to the Mum this week.--With       best love to all, I am, Your affectionate brother,             FRANK LOCKWOOD.\"    \"Mr. Mellor vouches for the following story, which, as it illustrates  Lockwood's humour and had gone the round of the newspapers, I will tell.  It is the ancient custom of the new Lord Mayor of London, attended by  the Recorder and Sheriffs, to come into the law-courts and be introduced  to the Lord Chief Justice or, if he is not there, to the senior judge to  be found on the premises, and, after a little lecture from the Bench, to  return good for evil by inviting the judges to dinner, only to receive  the somewhat chilling answer, 'Some of their lordships will attend.' On  this occasion the ceremony was over, and the Lord Mayor and his retinue  was retiring from the Court, when his lordship's eye rested on Lockwood,  who in a new wig was one of the throng by the door. 'Ah, my young  friend!' said the Lord Mayor in a pompous way (for in those days there  was no London County Council to teach Lord Mayors humility); 'picking up  a little law, I suppose?' Lockwood had his answer ready. With a profound  bow, he replied: 'I shall be delighted to accept your lordship's  hospitality. I think I heard your lordship name seven as the hour.' The  Lord Mayor hurried out of Court, and even the policeman (and to the  police Lord Mayors are almost divine) shook with laughter.\"    Counsel sometimes find their position so weak that their only hope of  damaging the other side lies in ridiculing their witnesses. Serjeant  Parry on one occasion was defending a client against a claim for breach  of promise of marriage made a few hours after a chance meeting in Regent  Street. According to the lady's story the introduction had been effected  through the gentleman offering to protect her from a dog. In course of  cross-examination Parry said: \"You say you were alarmed at two dogs  fighting, madam?\"--\"No, no, it was a single dog,\" was the reply. \"What  you mean, madam,\" retorted Parry, \"is that there was only one dog; but  whether it was a single dog or a married dog you are not in a position  to say.\" With this correction it need not be wondered that the lady had  little more to say.    A learned counsellor in the midst of an affecting appeal in Court on a  slander case delivered himself of the following flight of genius.  \"Slander, gentlemen, like a boa constrictor of gigantic size and  immeasurable proportions, wraps the coil of its unwieldy body about its  unfortunate victim, and, heedless of the shrieks of agony that come from  the utmost depths of its victim's soul, loud and reverberating as the  night thunder that rolls in the heavens, it finally breaks its unlucky  neck upon the iron wheel of public opinion; forcing him first to  desperation, then to madness, and finally crushing him in the hideous  jaws of mortal death.\"    Talking of his early days at the Bar, Mr. Thomas Edward Crispe, in  _Reminiscences of a K.C._, relates how on one occasion he was opposed by  a somewhat eccentric counsel named Wharton, known in his day as the  \"Poet of Pump Court.\" The case was really a simple one, but Wharton made  so much of it that when the luncheon half-hour came the judge, Mr.  Justice Archibald, with some emphasis, addressing Mr. Wharton, said: \"We  will now adjourn, and, Mr. Wharton, I hope you will take the opportunity  of conferring with your friend Mr. Crispe and settling the matter out of  Court.\"    But Wharton would not agree to this, and when at last he had to address  the jury, he, in the course of his speech, made the following remarks,  for every word of which Mr. Crispe vouches:    \"Gentlemen, I think it only courteous to the learned judge to refer to  the advice his lordship gave me to settle the matter out of Court. That  reminds me of a case, tried in a country court, in an action for  detention of a donkey. The plaintiff was a costermonger and the  defendant a costermonger; they conducted the case in person. At one  o'clock the judge said: 'Now, my men, I'm going to have my lunch, and  before I come back I hope you'll settle your dispute out of Court.' When  he returned the plaintiff came in with a black eye and the defendant  with a bleeding nose, and the defendant said: 'Well, your honour, we've  taken your honour's advice; Jim's given me a good hiding, and I've  given him back his donkey.'\"    Mr. F. E. Smith, M.P., tells a story of a County Court case he was once  engaged in, in which the plaintiff's son, a lad of eight years, was to  appear as a witness.    When the youngster entered the box he wore boots several sizes too  large, a hat that almost hid his face, long trousers rolled up so that  the baggy knees were at his ankles, and, to complete the picture, a  swallow-tail coat that had to be held to keep it from sweeping the  floor. This ludicrous picture was too much for the Court; but the judge,  between his spasms of laughter, managed to ask the boy his reason for  appearing in such garb.    With wondering look the lad fished in an inner pocket and hauled the  summons from it,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3003"],[0,"Wild Flowers (#13)"],[1,"larger flowers when they first open, are  in a condition to make cross-fertilization certain. So much for  the small flower's method of making insects serve its end; the  larger flowers have another way. At first they are male; that is,  the pistil is as yet undeveloped and the four stamens are mature,  ready to shed pollen on any insect alighting on the lip. Later,  when the stamens are past maturity, the pistil elongates itself  and is ready for the reception of pollen brought from younger  flowers. Many blossoms are male on the first day of opening, and  female later, to protect themselves against self-fertilization.    In Europe, where the aromatic leaves of this little creeper were  long ago used for fermenting and clarifying beer, it is known by  such names as ale-hoof and gill ale-gill, it is said, being  derived from the old French word, guiller, to ferment or make  merry. Having trailed across Europe, the persistent hardy plant  is now creeping its way over our continent, much to the disgust  of cattle, which show unmistakable dislike for a single leaf  caught up in a mouthful of herbage.    Very closely allied to the ground ivy is the CATMINT or CATNIP  (Nepela Cataria) ,whose pale-purple, or nearly white flowers,  dark-spotted, may be most easily named by crushing the coarsely  toothed leaves in one's hand. It is curious how cats will seek  out this hoary-hairy plant in the waste places where it grows and  become half-crazed with delight over its aromatic odor.      SELF-HEAL; HEAL-ALL; BLUE CURLS; HEART-OF-THE-EARTH; BRUNELLA  (Prunella vulgaris) Mint family    Flowers - Purple and violet, in dense spikes, somewhat resembling  a clover head; from 1/2 to 1 in. long in flower, becoming 4 times  the length in fruit. Corolla tubular, irregularly 2-lipped, the  upper lip darker and hood-like; the lower one 3-lobed, spreading,  the middle and largest lobe fringed; 4 twin-like stamens  ascending under upper lip; filaments ofthe lower and longer pair  2-toothed at summit, one of the teeth bearing an anther, the  other tooth sterile; style thread-like, shorter than stamens, and  terminating in a 2-cleft stigma. Calyx 2-parted, half the length  of corolla, its teeth often hairy on edges. Stem: 2 in. to 2 ft.  high, erect or reclining, simple or branched. Leaves: Opposite,  oblong. Fruit: 4 nutlets, round and smooth.  Preferred Habitat - Fields, roadsides, waste places.  Flowering Season - May-October.  Distribution - North America, Europe, Asia.    This humble, rusty green plant, weakly lopping over the  surrounding grass, so that often only its insignificant purple,  clover-like flower heads are visible, is another of those  immigrants from the old countries which, having proved fittest in  the fiercer struggle for existence there, has soon after its  introduction here exceeded most of our more favored native  flowers in numbers. Everywhere we find the heal-all, sometimes  dusty and stunted by the roadside, sometimes truly beautiful in  its fresh purple, violet, and white when perfectly developed  under happy conditions. In England, where most flowers are deeper  hued than with us, the heal-all is rich purple. What is the  secret of this flower's successful march across three continents?  As usual, the chief reason is to be found in the facility it  offers insects to secure food; and the quantity of fertile seed  it is therefore able to ripen as the result of their visits is  its reward. Also, its flowering season is unusually long, and it  is a tireless bloomer. It is finical in no respect; its sprawling  stems root easily at the joints, and it is very hardy.    Several species of bumblebees enter the flower, which being set  in dense clusters enables them to suck the nectar from each with  the minimum loss of time, the smaller bee spending about two  seconds to each. After allowing for the fraction of time it takes  him to sweep his eyes and the top of his head with his forelegs  to free them from the pollen which must inevitably be shaken from  the stamen in the arch of the corolla as he dives deeply after  the nectar in the bottom of the throat, and to pass the pollen,  just as honeybees do, with the most amazing quickness, from the  forelegs to the middle ones, and thence to the hairy \"basket\" on  the hind ones - after making all allowances for such delays, this  small worker is able to fertilize all the flowers in the fullest  cluster in half a minute! When the contents of the baskets of two  different species of bumblebees caught on this blossom were  examined under the microscope, the pollen in one case proved to  be heal-all, with some from the goldenrod, and a few grains of a  third kind not identified; and in the other case; heal-all pollen  and a small proportion of some unknown kind. Bees that are  evidently out for both nectar and pollen on the same trip have  been detected visiting white and yellow flowers on their way from  one heal-all cluster to another; and this fact, together with the  presence of more than one kind of pollen in the basket, shows  that the generally accepted statement that bees confine  themselves to flowers of one kind or color during a trip is not  always according to fact.    The older name of the plant, Brunella, and the significant one,  altered by Linnaeus into the softer sound it now bears, is  doubtless derived from the German word, braune, the quinsy.  Quaint old Parkinson reads: \"This is generally called prunella  and brunella from the Germans who called it brunellen, because it  cureth that disease which they call die bruen, common to soldiers  in campe, but especially in garrison, which is an inflammation of  the mouth, throat, and tongue.\" Among the old herbalists who  pretended to cure every ill that flesh is heir to with it, it was  variously known as carpenter's herb, sicklewort, hook-heal,  slough-heal, and brownwort.      AMERICAN or MOCK PENNYROYAL; TICKWEED; SQUAW MINT    (Hedeoma pulegioides)  Mint family    Flowers - Very small, bluish purple, clustered in axils of upper  leaves. Calyx tubular, unequally 5-cleft; teeth of upper lip  triangular, hairy in throat. Corolla 2-lipped, upper lip erect,  notched; lower one 3-cleft, spreading; 2 anther-bearing stamens  under upper lip; 2 sterile but apparent; 1 pistil with 2-cleft  style. Stem: Low, erect, branched, square, hairy, 6 to 18 in.  high. Leaves: Small, opposite, ovate to oblong, scantily toothed,  strongly aromatic, pungent.  Preferred Habitat - Dry fields, open woodland.  Flowering Season - July-September.  Distribution - Cape Breton Island westward to Nebraska, south to  Florida.    However insignificant its flower, this common little plant  unmistakably proclaims its presence throughout the neighborhood.  So powerful is the pungent aroma of its leaves that dog doctors  sprinkle them about freely in the kennels to kill fleas, a pest  by no means exterminated in Southern Europe, however, where the  true pennyroyal of commerce (Mentha Pulegium) is native. Herb  gatherers who collect our pennyroyal, that is so similar to the  European species it is similarly employed in medicine, say they  can scent it from a greater distance than any other plant.    BASTARD PENNYROYAL, which, like the Self-heal, is sometimes  called BLUE CURLS (Trichostema dichotomum), chooses dry fields,  but preferably sandy ones, where we find its abundant, tiny blue  flowers, that later change to purple, from July to October. Its  balsam-like odor is not agreeable, neither has the plant beauty  to recommend it; yet where it grows, from Maine to Florida, and  west to Texas, it is likely to be so common we cannot well pass  it unnoticed. The low, stiff, slender, much-branched, and rather  clammy stem bears opposite, oblong, smooth-edged leaves narrowed  into petioles. One, two, or three flowers, borne at the tips of  the branches, soon fall off, leaving the 5-cleft calyx to cradle  four exposed nutlets.    >From the five-lobed tubular corolla protrude four very long,  curling, blue or violet stamens - hair stamens the Greek generic  title signifies - and the pretty popular name of blue curls also  has reference to these conspicuous filaments that are spirally  coiled in the bud.    In general habit like the two preceding plants, the FALSE  PENNYROYAL (Isanthus brachiatus) nevertheless prefers that its  sandy home should be near streams. From Quebec to Georgia,  westward to Minnesota and Texas, it blooms in midsummer, lifting  its small, tubular, pale blue flowers from the axils of pointed,  opposite leaves. An unusual characteristic in one of the mint  tribe is that the five sharp lobes of its bell-shaped calyx, and  the five rounded, spreading lobes of the corolla, are of equal  length, hence its Greek name signifying an equal flower.      WILD or CREEPING THYME    (Thymus Serpyllum)  Mint family    Flowers - Very small purple or pink purple, fragrant, clustered  at ends of branches or in leaf axils. Hairy calyx and corolla  2-lipped, the latter with lower lip 3-cleft; stamens 4; style  2-cleft. Leaves: Oblong, opposite, aromatic. Stem: 4 to 12 in.  long) creeping, woody, branched, forming dense cushions.  Preferred Habitat - Roadsides, dry banks, and waste places.  Flowering Season - June-September.  Distribution - Naturalized from Europe. Nova Scotia to Middle  States.        \"I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,       Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows;       Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,       With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine.\"                          - A Midsummer Night's Dream.    According to Danish tradition, anyone waiting by an elder-bush on  Midsummer Night at twelve o'clock will see the king of fairyland  and all his retinue pass by and disport themselves in favorite  haunts, among others the mounds of fragrant wild thyme. How well  Shakespeare knew his folklore!    Thyme is said to have been one of the three plants which made the  Virgin Mary's bed. Indeed, the European"]]]
