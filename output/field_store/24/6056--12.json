In fact...  er... we none of us know anything... just at present....\"    He laughed lightly and carelessly, then deliberately readjusted the set  of his lace tie.    \"Percy!\" she said reproachfully.    \"Yes, m'dear.\"    \"Lately when you brought Deroulede and Juliette Marny to England... I  endured agonies of anxiety... and...\"    He sighed, a quick, short, wistful sigh, and said very gently:    \"I know you did, m'dear, and that is where the trouble lies. I know that  you are fretting, so I have to be so demmed quick about the business,  so as not to keep you in suspense too long.... And now I can't take  Ffoulkes away from his young wife, and Tony and the others are so mighty  slow.\"    \"Percy!\" she said once more with tender earnestness.    \"I know, I know,\" he said with a slight frown of self-reproach. \"La!  but I don't deserve your solicitude. Heavens know what a brute I was for  years, whilst I neglected you, and ignored the noble devotion which I,  alas! do even now so little to deserve.\"    She would have said something more, but was interrupted by the entrance  of Juliette Marny into the room.    \"Some of your guests have arrived, Lady Blakeney,\" said the young girl,  apologising for her seeming intrusion. \"I thought you would wish to  know.\"    Juliette looked very young and girlish in a simple white gown, without  a single jewel on her arms or neck. Marguerite regarded her with  unaffected approval.    \"You look charming to-night, Mademoiselle, does she not, Sir Percy?\"    \"Thanks to your bounty,\" smiled Juliette, a trifle sadly. \"Whilst  I dressed to-night, I felt how I should have loved to wear my dear  mother's jewels, of which she used to be so proud.\"    \"We must hope that you will recover them, dear, some day,\" said  Marguerite vaguely, as she led the young girl out of the small study  towards the larger reception rooms.    \"Indeed I hope so,\" sighed Juliette. \"When times became so troublous in  France after my dear father's death, his confessor and friend, the Abbe  Foucquet, took charge of all my mother's jewels for me. He said they  would be safe with the ornaments of his own little church at Boulogne.  He feared no sacrilege, and thought they would be most effectually  hidden there, for no one would dream of looking for the Marny diamonds  in the crypt of a country church.\"    Marguerite said nothing in reply. Whatever her own doubts might be upon  such a subject, it could serve no purpose to disturb the young girl's  serenity.    \"Dear Abbe Foucquet,\" said Juliette after a while, \"his is the kind of  devotion which I feel sure will never be found under the new regimes of  anarchy and of so-called equality. He would have laid down his life for  my father or for me. And I know that he would never part with the jewels  which I entrusted to his care, whilst he had breath and strength to  defend them.\"    Marguerite would have wished to pursue the subject a little further.  It was very pathetic to witness poor Juliette's hopes and confidences,  which she felt sure would never be realised.    Lady Blakeney knew so much of what was going on in France just now:  spoliations, confiscations, official thefts, open robberies, all in the  name of equality, of fraternity and of patriotism. She knew nothing,  of course, of the Abbe Foucquet, but the tender little picture of the  devoted old man, painted by Juliette's words, had appealed strongly to  her sympathetic heart.    Instinct and knowledge of the political aspect of France told her that  by entrusting valuable family jewels to the old Abbe, Juliette had most  unwittingly placed the man she so much trusted in danger of persecution  at the hands of a government which did not even admit the legality of  family possessions. However, there was neither time nor opportunity now  to enlarge upon the subject. Marguerite resolved to recur to it a little  later, when she would be alone with Mlle. de Marny, and above all  when she could take counsel with her husband as to the best means of  recovering the young girl's property for her, whilst relieving a devoted  old man from the dangerous responsibility which he had so selflessly  undertaken.    In the meanwhile the two women had reached the first of the long line  of state apartments wherein the brilliant fete was to take place.  The staircase and the hall below were already filled with the early  arrivals. Bidding Juliette to remain in the ballroom, Lady Blakeney now  took up her stand on the exquisitely decorated landing, ready to greet  her guests. She had a smile and a pleasant word for all, as, in a  constant stream, the elite of London fashionable society began to file  past her, exchanging the elaborate greetings which the stilted mode of  the day prescribed to this butterfly-world.    The lacqueys in the hall shouted the names of the guests as they passed  up the stairs: names celebrated in politics, in worlds of sport, of  science or of art, great historic names, humble, newly-made ones, noble  illustrious titles. The spacious rooms were filling fast. His Royal  Highness, so 'twas said, had just stepped out of his barge. The noise of  laughter and chatter was incessant, like unto a crowd of gaily-plumaged  birds. Huge bunches of apricot-coloured roses in silver vases made the  air heavy with their subtle perfume. Fans began to flutter. The string  band struck the preliminary cords of the gavotte.    At that moment the lacqueys at the foot of the stairs called out in  stentorian tones:    \"Mademoiselle Desiree Candeille! and Monsieur Chauvelin!\"    Marguerite's heart gave a slight flutter; she felt a sudden tightening  of the throat. She did not see Candeille at first, only the slight  figure of Chauvelin dressed all in black, as usual, with head bent  and hands clasped behind his back; he was slowly mounting the wide  staircase, between a double row of brilliantly attired men and women,  who looked with no small measure of curiosity at the ex-ambassador from  revolutionary France.    Demoiselle Candeille was leading the way up the stairs. She paused on  the landing in order to make before her hostess a most perfect and most  elaborate curtsey. She looked smiling and radiant, beautifully dressed,  a small wreath of wrought gold leaves in her hair, her only jewel an  absolutely regal one, a magnificent necklace of diamonds round her  shapely throat.          Chapter XI: The Challenge        It all occurred just before midnight, in one of the smaller rooms, which  lead in enfilade from the principal ballroom.    Dancing had been going on for some time, but the evening was close,  and there seemed to be a growing desire on the part of Lady Blakeney's  guests to wander desultorily through the gardens and glasshouses, or sit  about where some measure of coolness could be obtained.    There was a rumour that a new and charming French artiste was to sing a  few peculiarly ravishing songs, unheard in England before. Close to  the main ballroom was the octagon music-room which was brilliantly  illuminated, and in which a large number of chairs had been obviously  disposed for the comfort of an audience. Into this room many of  the guests had already assembled. It was quite clear that a  chamber-concert--select and attractive as were all Lady Blakeney's  entertainments--was in contemplation.    Marguerite herself, released for a moment from her constant duties near  her royal guests, had strolled through the smaller rooms, accompanied by  Juliette, in order to search for Mademoiselle Candeille and to suggest  the commencement of the improvised concert.    Desiree Candeille had kept herself very much aloof throughout the  evening, only talking to the one or two gentlemen whom her hostess had  presented to her on her arrival, and with M. Chauvelin always in close  attendance upon her every movement.    Presently, when dancing began, she retired to a small boudoir, and  there sat down, demurely waiting, until Lady Blakeney should require her  services.    When Marguerite and Juliette Marny entered the little room, she rose and  came forward a few steps.    \"I am ready, Madame,\" she said pleasantly, \"whenever you wish me to  begin. I have thought out a short programme,--shall I start with the gay  or the sentimental songs?\"    But before Marguerite had time to utter a reply, she felt her arm  nervously clutched by a hot and trembling hand.    \"Who... who is this woman?\" murmured Juliette Marny close to her ear.    The young girl looked pale and very agitated, and her large eyes were  fixed in unmistakable wrath upon the French actress before her. A little  startled, not understanding Juliette's attitude, Marguerite tried to  reply lightly:    \"This is Mademoiselle Candeille, Juliette dear,\" she said, affecting  the usual formal introduction, \"of the Varietes Theatre of  Paris--Mademoiselle Desiree Candeille, who will sing some charming  French ditties for us to-night.\"    While she spoke she kept a restraining hand on Juliette's quivering  arm. Already, with the keen intuition which had been on the qui-vive the  whole evening, she scented some mystery in this sudden outburst on the  part of her young protegee.    But Juliette did not heed her: she felt surging up in her young,  overburdened heart all the wrath and the contempt of the persecuted,  fugitive aristocrat against the triumphant usurper. She had suffered so  much from that particular class of the risen kitchen-wench of which the  woman before her was so typical and example: years of sorrow, of poverty  were behind her: loss of fortune, of kindred, of friends--she, even now  a pauper, living on the bounty of strangers.    And all this through no fault of her own: the fault of her class mayhap!  but not hers!    She had suffered much, and was still overwrought and nerve-strung: for  some reason she could not afterwards have explained, she felt spiteful  and uncontrolled, goaded into stupid fury by the look of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27867"],[0,"Scientific American magazine, Vol. 2 Issue 1 (#13)"],[1,"in South America, called  _jatropha elastica_. If these trees are punctured, a milky juice flows  out, which, on exposure to the air, thickens into a substance of a  pure white color, having neither taste nor smell. The hue of the  caoutchouc of commerce is black in consequence of the method employed  in drying it. The usual manner of performing this operation is to  spread a thin coating of the milky juice upon the moulds made of clay,  and fashioned into a variety of figures. These are then dried by  exposure to the heat of a smoke-fire: another layer is then spread  over the first, and dried by the same means; and thus layer after  layer is put on, until the whole is of the required thickness. While  yet soft it will receive and retain any impression that may be given  to if on the outside. When perfectly dry the clay within is broken  into small fragments by percussion, and the pieces are drawn out  through the aperture which is always left fur the purpose. The common  bottle of India Rubber, therefore, consists of numerous layers of pure  caoutchouc, alternating with as many layers of soot.    The natives of those parts of South America to which these trees are  indigenous, convert the juice to a variety of purposes. They collect  it chiefly in the rainy season, because, though it will exude at all  times, it flows then most abundantly. Boots are made of it by the  Indians, through which water cannot penetrate; and the inhabitants of  Quito prepare a kind of cloth with it, which they apply to the same  purposes as those for which oil-cloth or tarpaulin, it used here.  This, no doubt, is similar to the cloth now prepared with this  substance in America, the use of which yields so many important  advantages.--_Youths' Gazette_.           *       *       *       *       *          COMMUNICATION ON ATMOSPHERIC RESISTANCE.      The following letter has been on hand several weeks, but deferred on  account of a constant press of matter by which the limited space in  our former small sheet was crowded. Our respected correspondent has  consented to excuse the delay.                                              Providence, ---- 1846.    _Friend Porter_: In January last, I addressed a few lines to you,  asking information in regard to an article entitled Atmospheric  Resistance, in the New York Mechanic, of December 11, 1841. In your  answer, you say if the full surface is 30,000 square feet to each  wing, (which makes 60,000 square feet,) only about half of one horse  power would be required to sustain this weight, and I understand you,  virtually to say, that they must be ten times as large, in order that  the strength of one man be sufficient to work this and elevate himself  together with the apparatus, if it were not too heavy. Now, this makes  600,000 square feet. This is rather more than 774 feet square: rather  large sized wings. One would suppose that they might lift rather  heavy, if they were very light, being 387 by 774 feet each. Now, to me  this is entirely incomprehensible, and I should like an explanation,  if this calculation is correct, how it is that an eagle which  sometimes weighs nearly thirty pounds, can elevate himself, with so  much ease, and even carry with him nearly his own weight, using a pair  of wings, which if they were five feet long and two feet wide each,  would make but twenty feet of surface. Thus, you will see, is no where  in proportion to the weight even of the eagle alone, (which we will  suppose to weigh twenty pounds,) that the wings bears to the 150  pounds, while on the other hand, it is near in proportion to the  surface of the wings of a pidgeon and its weight. Nor can I comprehend  why it would require so much power, the eagle though he exerts himself  considerable in rising, no doubt, does not seem to use power any where  in the proportion that you have thought would be required supposing  the wings to be made in the same proportion to the 150 pounds that his  wings are to his weight, his beats are not so quick but what they can  be very easily counted.      By answering, you will much oblige,                              your friend,                                YANKEE.    In answer to the foregoing, we would remind our correspondent, that in  his former communication, he proposed a limited weight of apparatus,  and in our answer, it was far from our intention to allow an  additional weight on account of the requisite extent of surface. With  regard to the philosophy of the flight of the eagle, it must be borne  in mind that atmospheric resistance is as the square of the velocity  _downward_ and the only way in which the phenomenon of the flight  of the eagle can be reconciled with the laws of mechanical science as  established by experiment, is by supposing the velocity of the wing  downward to be equal to 70 feet per second, whereby a resistance would  be encountered equal to 12 pounds per square foot of surface to the  wings. It is a fact, however, that kites, and hawks are often seen to  continue suspended in the air several minutes without any apparent  motion of the wings; but by what law or theory the feat is  accomplished, natural philosophy has ventured no other conjecture than  that the bird is endowed with the faculty of suspending occasionally  its ordinary subjection to the laws of gravity. If any observing  theorist will give any more rational conjecture on the subject, we  should be glad to have him examine it.           *       *       *       *       *      It is proposed and urged by the papers in several States, to have a  thanksgiving day throughout the Union, on the 26th of November.           *       *       *       *       *      \"As dull as a hoe,\" is a very common phrase, and implies that hoes are  necessarily or ordinarily dull.

Various methods have been heretofore described, for raising heavy  bodies, or producing for other purposes, a great force,--usually  miscalled power--by the application of a comparatively small force:  but no method is known, more unlimited in its effect, or more simple  in construction; than the conical windlass. It consists of a simple  horizontal windlass, with a crank at one end, as shown in the  engraving. The windlass is made in a conical form, being a little  larger at one end, than at the other; and if the friction of its  bearings be relieved by the ordinary friction rollers, it will so far  multiply the force applied, as to break a double inch-rope, by the  power of one man at the crank. An endless rope, or one of which the  two ends are spliced together, is passed five or six times round the  small end of the windlass, and down under a single pulley below: then,  as the windlass is turned by the crank, the rope is constantly given  off from one part, while the circumference is greater. Now it is  plain, that if the windlass is one-fifth of an inch larger in  circumference, at the point at which the rope is taken up, than at the  place where it is given off to the pulley, that whatever may be  appended thereto, will be raised one tenth of an inch by each  revolution Then, if we suppose the crank lever to be fifteen inches,  the handle will travel about 100 inches, in each revolution, which  gives a power, or increase of force, of 1000 to one. Therefore, if 100  pounds of power be applied to the crank handle, it will be  sufficient--minus friction--to raise a weight of 100,000 lbs. The only  inconvenience in this apparatus, and which prevents its coming into  more general use, is, that it is too limited in the extent of its  motion, in consequence of the travelling of the rope from one end of  the windlass to the other. Thus, if the windlass be but twenty-five  inches long, and the rope one inch in diameter, it will admit only  twenty revolutions, without renewing. Yet, in many cases, in which an  article in required to be raised, or moved but a few inches, the  conical windlass will be found preferable to any other method.           *       *       *       *       *          REQUISITE STRENGTH OF STEAM BOILERS.      Our correspondent S. B. cannot comprehend that the strength of iron  for a cylindrical boiler should Be in direct proportion to the  diameter thereof, in order to sustain an equal pressure per square  inch; wherefore, we must reason with him on the long scale. The  cohesive strength of good iron is 64,000 lbs. per square inch; and of  course, a strip of boiler-iron plate 1/8th inch thick will sustain  8000 lbs. If a boiler made of thin iron is 14 inches in diameter, or  44 inches in circumference, each inch of its length will contain 44  square inches, and either half thereof will contain 22 inches, and as  the pressure on this portion is sustained by at least two inches of  width of plate,--one inch on each side,--it follows that it will  sustain a pressure of at least 700 lbs. per square inch, in the  direction of circumference. If the diameter is double, the number of  square inches will be double, and will require double the thickness to  sustain equal pressure. With regard to the pressure endwise, the area  of a cylinder head 14 inches in diameter is 154 inches, and the  strength of the 44 inches of circumference would be sufficient to  sustain 352,000 lbs., which, divided by the area, is 2,275 lbs. per  square inch. If the diameter is 56 inches, the circumference being  172, would sustain a pressure endwise of 555 lbs. per inch. Thus it  will be seen that if the cylinder were even 20 feet in diameter, the  iron would better sustain the pressure on the head that on the  periphery. With regard to the requisite strength of the cylinder's  head, if they are made in a semi-spherical convex form, they will  require no more thickness of plate than the cylinder: but if they"]]]
