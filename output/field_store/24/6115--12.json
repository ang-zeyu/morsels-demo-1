Grimalkin decides to kill a canary in a neighbouring verandah. Consider  the fascination of it--the stealthy reconnaissance from the top of the  fence; the care to avoid waking the house-dog, the noiseless approach  and the hurried dash, and the fierce clawing at the fluttering bird till  its mangled body is dragged through the bars of the cage; the exultant  retreat with the spoil; the growling over the feast that follows. Not  the least entertaining part of it is the demure satisfaction of arriving  home in time for breakfast and hearing the house-mistress say: \"Tom must  be sick; he seems to have no appetite.\"    It is always levelled as a reproach against cats that they are more fond  of their home than of the people in it. Naturally, the cat doesn't like  to leave his country, the land where all his friends are, and where he  knows every landmark. Exiled in a strange land, he would have to learn a  new geography, to exploit another tribe of dogs, to fight and make love  to an entirely new nation of cats. Life isn't long enough for that sort  of thing. So, when the family moves, the cat, if allowed, will stay at  the old house and attach himself to the new tenants. He will give them  the privilege of boarding him while he enjoys life in his own way. He  is not going to sacrifice his whole career for the doubtful reward which  fidelity to his old master or mistress might bring.          SITTING IN JUDGMENT      The show ring was a circular enclosure of about four acres, with a  spiked batten fence round it, and a listless crowd of back-country  settlers propped along the fence. Behind them were the sheds for  produce, and the machinery sections where steam threshers and earth  scoops hummed and buzzed and thundered unnoticed. Crowds of sightseers  wandered past the cattle stalls to gape at the fat bullocks; side-shows  flourished, a blase goose drew marbles out of a tin canister, and a  boxing showman displayed his muscles outside his tent, while his partner  urged the youth of the district to come in and be thumped for the  edification of the spectators.    Suddenly a gate opened at the end of the show ring, and horses, cattle,  dogs, vehicles, motor-cars, and bicyclists crowded into the arena. This  was the general parade, but it would have been better described as a  general chaos. Trotting horses and ponies, in harness, went whirling  round the ring, every horse and every driver fully certain that  every eye was fixed on them; the horses--the vainest creatures in the  world--arching their necks and lifting their feet, whizzed past in  bewildering succession, till the onlookers grew giddy. Inside the  whirling circle blood stallions stood on their hind legs, screaming  defiance to the world at large; great shaggy-fronted bulls, with dull  vindictive eyes, paced along, looking as though they were trying to  remember who it was that struck them last. A showground bull always  seems to be nursing a grievance.    Mixed up with the stallions and bulls were dogs and donkeys. The dogs  were led by attendants, apparently selected on the principle of the  larger the dog the smaller the custodian; while the donkeys were the  only creatures unmoved by their surroundings, for they slept peaceably  through the procession, occasionally waking up to bray their sense of  boredom.    In the centre of the ring a few lady-riders, stern-featured women for  the most part, were being \"judged\" by a trembling official, who feared  to look them in the face, but hurriedly and apologetically examined  horses and saddles, whispered his award to the stewards, and fled at  top speed to the official stand--his sanctuary from the fury of spurned  beauty. The defeated ladies immediately began to \"perform\"--that is, to  ask the universe at large whether anyone ever heard the like of that!  But the stewards strategically slipped away, and the injured innocents  had no resource left but to ride haughtily round the ring, glaring  defiance at the spectators.    All this time stewards and committee-men were wandering among the  competitors, trying to find the animals for judgment. The clerk of the  ring--a huge man on a small cob--galloped around, roaring like a  bull: \"This way for the fourteen stone 'acks! Come on, you twelve  'and ponies!\" and by degrees various classes got judged, and dispersed  grumbling. Then the bulls filed out with their grievances still  unsettled, the lady riders were persuaded to withdraw, and the clerk of  the ring sent a sonorous bellow across the ground: \"Where's the jumpin'  judges?\"    From the official stand came a brisk, dark-faced, wiry little man. He  had been a steeplechase rider and a trainer in his time. Long experience  of that tricky animal, the horse, had made him reserved and slow to  express an opinion. He mounted the table, and produced a note-book.  From the bar of the booth came a large, hairy, red-faced man, whose face  showed fatuous self-complacency. He was a noted show-judge because he  refused, on principle, to listen to others' opinions; or in those rare  cases when he did, only to eject a scornful contradiction. The third  judge was a local squatter, who was overwhelmed with a sense of his own  importance.    They seated themselves on a raised platform in the centre of the ring,  and held consultation. The small dark man produced his note-book.    \"I always keep a scale of points,\" he said. \"Give 'em so many points for  each fence. Then give 'em so many for make, shape, and quality, and so  many for the way they jump.\"    The fat man looked infinite contempt. \"I never want any scale of  points,\" he said. \"One look at the 'orses is enough for me. A man that  judges by points ain't a judge at all, I reckon. What do you think?\" he  went on, turning to the squatter. \"Do you go by points?\"    \"Never,\" said the squatter, firmly; which, as he had never judged before  in his life, was strictly true.    \"Well, we'll each go our own way,\" said the little man. \"I'll keep  points. Send 'em in.\"    \"Number One, Conductor!\" roared the ring steward in a voice like  thunder, and a long-legged grey horse came trotting into the ring and  sidled about uneasily. His rider pointed him for the first jump, and  went at it at a terrific pace. Nearing the fence the horse made a wild  spring, and cleared it by feet, while the crowd yelled applause. At the  second jump he raced right under the obstacle, propped dead, and rose  in the air with a leap like a goat, while the crowd yelled their delight  again, and said: \"My oath! ain't he clever?\" As he neared the third  fence he shifted about uneasily, and finally took it at an angle,  clearing a wholly unnecessary thirty feet. Again the hurricane of cheers  broke out. \"Don't he fly 'em,\" said one man, waving his hat. At the  last fence he made his spring yards too soon; his forelegs got over all  right, but his hind legs dropped on the rail with a sounding rap, and he  left a little tuft of hair sticking on it.    \"I like to see 'em feel their fences,\" said the fat man. \"I had a  bay 'orse once, and he felt every fence he ever jumped; shows their  confidence.\"    \"I think he'll feel that last one for a while,\" said the little dark  man. \"What's this now?\"    \"Number Two, Homeward Bound!\" An old, solid chestnut horse came out and  cantered up to each jump, clearing them coolly and methodically. The  crowd was not struck by the performance, and the fat man said: \"No  pace!\" but surreptitiously made two strokes (to indicate Number Two) on  the cuff of his shirt.    \"Number Eleven, Spite!\" This was a leggy, weedy chestnut,  half-racehorse, half-nondescript, ridden by a terrified amateur, who  went at the fence with a white, set face. The horse raced up to the  fence, and stopped dead, amid the jeers of the crowd. The rider let  daylight into him with his spurs, and rushed him at it again. This time  he got over.    Round he went, clouting some fences with his front legs, others with  his hind legs. The crowd jeered, but the fat man, from a sheer spirit  of opposition, said: \"That would be a good horse if he was rode better.\"  And the squatter remarked: \"Yes, he belongs to a young feller just near  me. I've seen him jump splendidly out in the bush, over brush fences.\"    The little dark man said nothing, but made a note in his book.    \"Number Twelve, Gaslight!\" \"Now, you'll see a horse,\" said the fat man.  \"I've judged this 'orse in twenty different shows, and gave him first  prize every time!\"    Gaslight turned out to be a fiddle-headed, heavy-shouldered brute, whose  long experience of jumping in shows where they give points for pace--as  if the affair was a steeplechase--had taught him to get the business  over as quickly as he could. He went thundering round the ring, pulling  double, and standing off his fences in a style that would infallibly  bring him to grief if following hounds across roads or through broken  timber.    \"Now,\" said the fat man, \"that's a 'unter, that is. What I say is, when  you come to judge at a show, pick out the 'orse you'd soonest be on if  Ned Kelly was after you, and there you have the best 'unter.\"    The little man did not reply, but made the usual scrawl in his book,  while the squatter hastened to agree with the fat man. \"I like to see a  bit of pace myself,\" he ventured.    The fat man sat on him heavily. \"You don't call that pace, do you?\" he  said. \"He was going dead slow.\"    Various other competitors did their turn round the ring, some propping  and bucking over the jumps, others rushing and tearing at their fences;  not one jumped as a hunter should. Some got themselves into difficulties  by changing feet or misjudging the distance, and were loudly applauded  by the crowd for \"cleverness\" in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#13)"],[1,"he has done.

THE SIX DIVISIONS OF ARCHITECTURE.      Sec. I. The practical duties of buildings are twofold.    They have either (1), to hold and protect something; or (2), to place or  carry something.    1. Architecture of Protection. This is architecture intended to     protect men or their possessions from violence of any kind, whether     of men or of the elements. It will include all churches, houses, and     treasuries; fortresses, fences, and ramparts; the architecture of the     hut and sheepfold; of the palace and the citadel: of the dyke,     breakwater, and sea-wall. And the protection, when of living     creatures, is to be understood as including commodiousness and     comfort of habitation, wherever these are possible under the given     circumstances.    2. Architecture of Position. This is architecture intended to carry     men or things to some certain places, or to hold them there. This     will include all bridges, aqueducts, and road architecture;     light-houses, which have to hold light in appointed places; chimneys     to carry smoke or direct currents of air; staircases; towers, which     are to be watched from or cried from, as in mosques, or to hold     bells, or to place men in positions of offence, as ancient moveable     attacking towers, and most fortress towers.    Sec. II. Protective architecture has to do one or all of three things:  to wall a space, to roof it, and to give access to it, of persons, light,  and air; and it is therefore to be considered under the three divisions  of walls, roofs, and apertures.    We will take, first, a short, general view of the connection of these  members, and then examine them in detail: endeavoring always to keep the  simplicity of our first arrangement in view; for protective architecture  has indeed no other members than these, unless flooring and paving be  considered architecture, which it is only when the flooring is also a  roof; the laying of the stones or timbers for footing being pavior's or  carpenter's work, rather than architect's; and, at all events, work  respecting the well or ill doing of which we shall hardly find much  difference of opinion, except in points of aesthetics. We shall therefore  concern ourselves only with the construction of walls, roofs, and  apertures.    Sec. III. 1. _Walls._--A wall is an even and united fence, whether of  wood, earth, stone, or metal. When meant for purposes of mere partition  or enclosure, it remains a wall proper: but it has generally also to  sustain a certain vertical or lateral pressure, for which its strength  is at first increased by some general addition to its thickness; but if  the pressure becomes very great, it is gathered up into _piers_ to  resist vertical pressure, and supported by _buttresses_ to resist  lateral pressure.    If its functions of partition or enclosure are continued, together with  that of resisting vertical pressure, it remains as a wall veil between  the piers into which it has been partly gathered; but if it is required  only to resist the vertical or roof pressure, it is gathered up into  piers altogether, loses its wall character, and becomes a group or line  of piers.    On the other hand, if the lateral pressure be slight, it may retain its  character of a wall, being supported against the pressure by buttresses  at intervals; but if the lateral pressure be very great, it is supported  against such pressure by a continuous buttress, loses its wall  character, and becomes a dyke or rampart.    Sec. IV. We shall have therefore (A) first to get a general idea of a  wall, and of right construction of walls; then (B) to see how this wall  is gathered into piers; and to get a general idea of piers and the  right construction of piers; then (C) to see how a wall is supported by  buttresses, and to get a general idea of buttresses and the right  construction of buttresses. This is surely very simple, and it is all we  shall have to do with walls and their divisions.    [Illustration: Fig. I.]    Sec. V. 2. _Roofs._--A roof is the covering of a space, narrow or wide.  It will be most conveniently studied by first considering the forms in  which it may be carried over a narrow space, and then expanding these on  a wide plan; only there is some difficulty here in the nomenclature, for  an arched roof over a narrow space has (I believe) no name, except that  which belongs properly to the piece of stone or wood composing such a  roof, namely, lintel. But the reader will have no difficulty in  understanding that he is first to consider roofs on the section only,  thinking how best to construct a narrow bar or slice of them, of  whatever form; as, for instance, _x_, _y_, or _z_, over the plan or area  _a_, Fig. I. Having done this, let him imagine these several divisions,  first moved along (or set side by side) over a rectangle, _b_, Fig. I.,  and then revolved round a point (or crossed at it) over a polygon, _c_,  or circle, _d_, and he will have every form of simple roof: the arched  section giving successively the vaulted roof and dome, and the gabled  section giving the gabled roof and spire.    As we go farther into the subject, we shall only have to add one or two  forms to the sections here given, in order to embrace all the  _uncombined_ roofs in existence; and we shall not trouble the reader  with many questions respecting cross-vaulting, and other modes of their  combination.    Sec. VI. Now, it also happens, from its place in buildings, that the  sectional roof over a narrow space will need to be considered before we  come to the expanded roof over a broad one. For when a wall has been  gathered, as above explained, into piers, that it may better bear  vertical pressure, it is generally necessary that it should be expanded  again at the top into a continuous wall before it carries the true roof.  Arches or lintels are, therefore, thrown from pier to pier, and a level  preparation for carrying the real roof is made above them. After we have  examined the structure of piers, therefore, we shall have to see how  lintels or arches are thrown from pier to pier, and the whole prepared  for the superincumbent roof; this arrangement being universal in all  good architecture prepared for vertical pressures: and we shall then  examine the condition of the great roof itself. And because the  structure of the roof very often introduces certain lateral pressures  which have much to do with the placing of buttresses, it will be well to  do all this before we examine the nature of buttresses, and, therefore,  between parts (B) and (C) of the above plan, Sec. IV. So now we shall have  to study: (A) the construction of walls; (B) that of piers; (C) that of  lintels or arches prepared for roofing; (D) that of roofs proper; and  (E) that of buttresses.    Sec. VII. 3. _Apertures._--There must either be intervals between the  piers, of which intervals the character will be determined by that of  the piers themselves, or else doors or windows in the walls proper. And,  respecting doors or windows, we have to determine three things: first,  the proper shape of the entire aperture; secondly, the way in which it  is to be filled with valves or glass; and thirdly, the modes of  protecting it on the outside, and fitting appliances of convenience to  it, as porches or balconies. And this will be our division F; and if the  reader will have the patience to go through these six heads, which  include every possible feature of protective architecture, and to  consider the simple necessities and fitnesses of each, I will answer for  it, he shall never confound good architecture with bad any more. For, as  to architecture of position, a great part of it involves necessities of  construction with which the spectator cannot become generally  acquainted, and of the compliance with which he is therefore never  expected to judge,--as in chimneys, light-houses, &c.: and the other  forms of it are so closely connected with those of protective  architecture, that a few words in Chap. XIX. respecting staircases and  towers, will contain all with which the reader need be troubled on the  subject.          CHAPTER IV.      THE WALL BASE.      Sec. I. Our first business, then, is with Wall, and to find out wherein  lies the true excellence of the \"Wittiest Partition.\" For it is rather  strange that, often as we speak of a \"dead\" wall, and that with  considerable disgust, we have not often, since Snout's time, heard of a  living one. But the common epithet of opprobrium is justly bestowed, and  marks a right feeling. A wall has no business to be dead. It ought to  have members in its make, and purposes in its existence, like an  organized creature, and to answer its ends in a living and energetic  way; and it is only when we do not choose to put any strength nor  organization into it, that it offends us by its deadness. Every wall  ought to be a \"sweet and lovely wall.\" I do not care about its having  ears; but, for instruction and exhortation, I would often have it to  \"hold up its fingers.\" What its necessary members and excellences are,  it is our present business to discover.    Sec. II. A wall has been defined to be an even and united fence of wood,  earth, stone, or metal. Metal fences, however, seldom, if"]]]
