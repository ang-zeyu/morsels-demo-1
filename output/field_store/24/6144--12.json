[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32982"],[0,"Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America, Edible and Poisonous (#13)"],[1," A Washington florist who utilizes the lower shelves of  his propagating houses for the purpose of mushroom growing informed me  that during two seasons he received 60 cents per pound wholesale,  shipping to New York, and that he sold one thousand dollars worth in one  season. Mr. Denton, a market gardener of Long Island, who cultivates in  houses built for the purpose, markets from 1,700 to 2,500 pounds per  year.    Thus far the market is in the hands of a comparatively few dealers in  the neighborhood of large cities, but there is certainly no good reason  why the growing of mushrooms should not be more generally undertaken by  the farming community. Certainly no one has better facilities than are  at the command of the enterprising American farmer. On most farms the  conditions are favorable or could easily be made so for mushroom  culture, on a moderate scale, at least. Generally there are disused  sheds, old barns, etc., which with a small outlay could be transformed  into mushroom houses, and where timber is plentiful the cost of building  a small mushroom house would be repaid by the profits accruing from the  business.    In the culture of mushrooms there are open, to the enterprising with  small capital, four sources of profit: first, the sale of the fresh  mushrooms; second, the manufacture of mushroom catsup; third, the  canning of the small button mushroom for exportation; and, fourth, the  manufacture of spawn.    It is well in this, as in all new industries, to begin in a small way,  and if success is attained it is easy to extend operations on a larger  scale. My advice to amateurs is to begin with one or two beds in a  well-drained cellar or shed where good ventilation and even temperature  can be secured at moderate cost. In the underground cellar economy is  secured by the saving in fuel. The beds can be made on the floor, flat,  ridged or banked against the wall, ten or twelve inches deep in a warm  cellar, and from fifteen to twenty inches in a cool cellar. The boxing  for the sides and ends may be built six or eight inches higher than the  beds to give the mushrooms plenty of head room.      DIRECTIONS FOR PREPARING THE COMPOST FOR THE BEDS.    Procure not less than a cartload of clean, fresh stable manure. Place it  under cover, to protect it from rain and drain water, mix well and heap  up the whole mass into a mound three feet high then beat the mound  firmly down to prevent undue heating. Repeat this operation every other  day until its rank smell is gone, taking care that on each turning the  outside dry manure is placed in the centre of the mound. By this means  the stable odor is dissipated while its heating properties are equally  distributed. Add to this from one-fourth to one-fifth of clean, rich  garden mould. Mix well. After this careful handling, the mass may be  considered fit for bedding purposes. When placed in the beds the mass  should be compacted again by beating with the back of a spade or trowel.  The bed surface should appear moist but not wet, smooth and of firm  consistence. From day to day it will be necessary to test its general  temperature by means of a thermometer. To this end make at various  places at different depths openings sufficiently large to admit the use  of a thermometer. It will be found that the temperature is highest  nearest the bottom. Test at various points. At first the temperature  will run high; 105 to 120 Fahrenheit is probably as high as it will  reach, but in a few days it will fall to 85 or 80 Fahrenheit. At this  point spawn the bed. For this purpose make holes in the top of the bed  about six inches apart and two inches deep with a blunt dibble or broom  handle. Place in these holes or openings a piece of brick spawn about  the size of a hen's egg, and cover the holes with manure; finish by  packing the same, keeping the surface of the bed smooth and moist. The  spawn should be slightly moistened before using. Should the surface of  the bed become dry, use water from a fine sprinkling pan. The  temperature of the cellar or house in which the bed may be placed should  range between 55 and 75, and should not be lower than 50. If the  spawn is good and all conditions attended to, the white filaments should  appear spreading through the bed within eight or ten days after  spawning. When the white spawn is observed on or near the surface, cover  the whole surface with from one to two inches of garden loam well  pulverized. A good general rule for spawning the bed is to wait until  the heat of the bed is on the decline and has fallen to at least 90  Fahrenheit. If the heat in the middle of the bed runs too high the  spawn is killed. The experience of a number of growers has shown that a  bed spawned at 60 to 80 and kept at 55 after the mushrooms appear  gives better results than one spawned at 90.    The quality of the manure makes some difference in its temperature. That  obtained from stables where horses are grass fed will be of lower normal  temperature and will chill quicker than that obtained from corn or oat  fed stock.    A solution of saltpeter in proportion of about fifteen grains to a quart  of water, occasionally spread over the bed with a fine hose, helps to  accelerate the growth of the mushrooms.    The proper condition of the manure as regards dryness or moistness can  be readily ascertained by squeezing it in the hand; it should be  unctuous enough to hold together in a lump, and so dry that you cannot  squeeze a drop of water out of it. Excessive moisture in the manure has  been often a cause of failure. It should be remembered also that when  the heat of the manure is on the decline it falls rapidly, five, often  ten degrees a day, till it reaches about 75, and between that and 65  it may rest for weeks.    One of the principal causes of the failure of mushroom culture in this  country is the use of old or poor spawn. Good spawn should have a fresh,  mushroomy odor, and a bluish-white appearance on the surface. In buying  spawn one should always go to reliable seedsmen.      COMPOST FOR MUSHROOM BEDS.    Sawdust has been used in England for mushroom beds, after having been  used for stable bedding, with very good results. It has also been used  successfully in the District of Columbia. In fact, the very large models  of cultivated mushrooms exhibited by the Division of Microscopy of the  Department of Agriculture at the World's Fair in Chicago were moulded  from mushrooms which were grown on the writer's premises, in a  composition of sawdust stable bedding, combined with about one-fourth  garden mould, but I am confident, at the same time, that much depends on  the kind of timber the sawdust is made from. In this case the sawdust  came from spruce.      MUSHROOM CULTURE IN CANADA.    A Canadian correspondent informs me that he, with others, has been very  successful in growing mushrooms in the open air during the summer months  in Canada, and gives the following directions for preparing the beds in  the colder latitudes:    Place under a shed such amount of clean stable manure as may be required  for the beds, turning it over and over until all free ammonia has  escaped and the tendency of undue fermentation and evolution of high  temperature has greatly modified. To effect this, it is necessary to  heap up the manure each time in a mound, say three feet high after  turning, and beat it firmly down (the exclusion of free air prevents  overheating). To put the manure in proper condition for use in the beds,  from two to four weeks' treatment may be required, but much depends on  the quality of the manure and temperature of the atmosphere. Before  making the beds, and several days after the last turning, test the  internal temperature of the mound in the following manner: Make a hole  with a broomstick through the mound from top to bottom, and suspend a  thermometer half way down in the hole for, say, an hour. The temperature  may be as high as 150 F. After the lapse of the time stated, beat the  mound more firmly down to prevent rise of temperature. Test again two  days after in the same manner. If the temperature has risen several  degrees the mound must be again taken down, turned over, and remade. If,  on the other hand, the temperature has fallen to 100 F., the permanent  bed may be made. If indoor growth is desired, such as a cellar,  outbuilding, or cave, the atmosphere must not fall below 50 F., nor be  over 80 F. Air drafts cannot be permitted. The floor must be dry and  the atmosphere moist. The cellar may be dark, or moderately light.  Growers differ in opinion in this respect. Growers generally add to the  manure about one-fourth or one-fifth garden soil, but success has been  attained without the use of garden soil, except as surface dressing  after spawning the bed; an excessive use of loam, in any case, tends to  lower the temperature too rapidly. Having prepared a box or frame-work  for the bed twelve inches deep, fill it up to within two inches of the  top; beat gently down with a board, or a brick, until it is even and  compact. On the following day make holes in the bed, with a dibble, ten  inches deep, in which suspend a thermometer half way down for an hour.  Should the temperature have fallen to 90 F., cover lightly with straw  and test on the following day. Should the temperature prove to be going  down, say to 80 F., or 85 F., it is safe to plant the spawn; but  should the temperature be on the rise, wait until it is falling. One  grower has stated that his greatest success has been when the spawn was  planted at the temperature of 75 F. Should the temperature fall too  quickly and the surface be too dry, sprinkle with water at blood heat,  using a very fine hose, and cover the bed with straw.    The spawn brick should be cut into pieces, about the size of an egg, and  planted in holes made in the bed, about two inches deep and about six  inches apart. The holes are then filled up and about two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33029"],[0,"Ducks and Geese (#13)"],[1,", eggs  sufficient to fill the entire incubator capacity are not put in the  machines at any one time but different lots are put in as soon as a  sufficient number is obtained to make it worth while. There will be,  therefore, eggs in various stages of incubation in different sections of  the machines at the same time. While Pekin duck eggs will run about 1/2  heavier in weight than hens' eggs they do not take up a proportionately  greater amount of space in the incubator. An incubator tray will  accommodate about 5/6 as many Pekin duck eggs as it will hens' eggs.    _Age of Hatching Eggs._ Duck eggs should be set as often as enough are  secured to fill one or more trays in the incubator or enough to produce  a sufficient number of ducklings to utilize brooding space to advantage.  Since duck eggs deteriorate more rapidly than hens' eggs they cannot be  kept so long before they are set. It is best not to save them for longer  than one week. During the season of flush production it is not, of  course, necessary to save them that long since enough eggs will be  secured to set each day if desired. The usual practice at this time is  to set twice a week. During the early part of the season when the  production of eggs is low and the temperature cool the eggs are often  saved for as long a period as two weeks without noticeably bad results.    _Care of Hatching Eggs._ Eggs for hatching should be kept in a cool  place. Any place suitable for keeping hens' eggs for hatching is a  suitable place for duck eggs. The temperature should be from 50 deg. to 70 deg.  Fahrenheit. Where the eggs are not kept longer than one week, it is not  necessary to turn them, especially if they are kept on end. If kept  longer than this it is safer to turn them once a day or once in two  days, handling them carefully so as not to crack any or to injure their  hatching qualities.    _Selecting the Eggs for Hatching._ Medium sized eggs are preferred for  this purpose. Therefore, the extremely large eggs and the very small  ones are thrown out. Rough shelled eggs or eggs with crooked or deformed  shells are likewise thrown out since they are not likely to hatch well.  Eggs that are badly soiled so that they cannot be tested easily are  washed but the clean eggs are not. All the eggs intended for incubation  purposes are sounded by striking them gently against one another in  order to detect and remove the cracked eggs. No selection is made on the  basis of color. The eggs may be white, creamy white or a blue, or bluish  green in color. At the present time a considerably less proportion of  the eggs show a blue tint than formerly. As the egg laying season  advances the eggs laid by the ducks tend to get a little larger.    _Temperature._ Up to the time of testing, that is, about the fifth day,  the incubator is run at a temperature of from 101 to 102 degrees. After  the fifth day the temperature is kept as near 103 as possible. The most  sensitive period for a duck egg is during the first 3 or 4 days of  incubation. If they are allowed to get too warm during this time the  germ may be killed while if the temperature is too low, development will  be retarded.    _Position of the Thermometer._ In figuring on the proper temperature at  which to run the incubator, the thermometer should be so placed that the  bulb is on a level with the top of the eggs, preferably touching a  fertile egg. If the thermometer bulb rests on an infertile egg the  temperature recorded will be lower than the actual temperature of  fertile eggs in the later stages of incubation, due to the animal heat  of the developing embryos, with the result that the machine would be  operated at too high a temperature.    _Testing._ It is common practice to make only one complete test. This is  done on the evening of the fifth day. Testing may be done by means of an  ordinary candling device such as is used with hens' eggs, each egg being  examined separately. To save time a piece of apparatus may be used which  is simple in construction and which simplifies the process of candling  considerably. This may be termed a testing table. It consists of a  table the same width as an incubator tray and longer than the tray. In  the table there is an opening the size of a row of eggs and beneath this  are placed several electric light bulbs with reflectors back of them so  as to throw the light up through the eggs. By sliding the tray along the  table each row of eggs is brought over the lights and their condition  can be quickly noted. At this test all the infertile eggs are taken out  as well as any eggs in which the germs have died. The infertile eggs  after a careful retest are then packed in cases and sent to market where  they are usually sold to bakers as tested eggs. While no second test is  made of the eggs left in the machines the experienced incubator operator  is constantly on the watch for and is constantly removing any eggs which  die at a later time. To the experienced eye the color of the egg  indicates that it has died as it takes on a sort of pinkish or darkish  tint. Duck eggs after they die will spoil very quickly and must be  removed promptly as the odor which they throw off is very strong and  will prove harmful to the other eggs. The inexperienced operator can  readily locate dead eggs by smelling over the tray.    [Illustration: FIG. 21. Interior of house for breeding ducks. Notice the  heavy bedding and the feeding track. (_Photograph from the Bureau of  Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    [Illustration: FIG. 22. Incubator cellar on large duck plant. Trays of  eggs set out to turn and cool. (_Photograph from the Bureau of Animal  Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _Turning the Eggs._ The eggs are neither turned, cooled nor otherwise  disturbed after they are put in the incubator until after they are  tested on the fifth day. From this time on they are turned twice a day,  morning and night, until they begin to pip.    _Cooling the Eggs._ There is a considerable difference in the practice  of incubator operators with regard to cooling. No cooling should be done  until after the first test. After this some incubator men cool the eggs  by dropping the doors of the machine. Others take the trays of eggs out  and put them on top of the machine. Cooling is usually done once a day.  The amount of cooling which the eggs require seems to vary greatly and  here again the judgment of the operator comes into play. About the best  general rule which can be given is that the eggs should be cooled until  they do not feel warm to the face but they should never be cooled to the  extent that they feel cold to the face or hands. The length of time to  bring this about varies with the age of the eggs and the temperature of  the room.    _Moisture._ A good deal of moisture is used in incubating duck eggs. It  is usual to begin to spray the eggs with water the next day after  testing. However, this may vary anywhere from the sixth to the tenth  day. They are sprayed quite thoroughly, some men using water enough so  that it runs out of the bottom of the machine. No particular care is  taken to see that the water used is warm. Ordinary water just as it  comes from the pipes is commonly used and is applied by means of a spray  nozzle attached to a hose. However, extremely cold water should not be  used for this purpose. This spraying is done once or twice a day as the  operator may think necessary until the eggs begin to hatch. In many  cases even then if the ducklings seem to be drying too fast after they  come out of the shell, or to be having difficulty to get out it is well  to open the machines and wet the eggs down thoroughly.    _Fertility._ The fertility varies with the season that is, with the  weather. At the beginning of the laying season when the weather is cold  the fertility usually runs rather low. This is likewise true at the end  of the laying season when the heat of summer sets in. During the  interval between these two times of low fertility there will usually be  one or more periods during which the fertility will go down and then  come back again. This seems to occur even though the weather remains  about the same and though there is no change in the method of feeding.  Fertility may be considered to be good when it runs about 85%. When the  fertility is running poor the hatching of the eggs left in the machines  after testing will usually be poor also.    _Hatching._ It takes longer as a rule from the time that the ducklings  pip the eggs until they hatch than it does with chicks. To retain the  moisture which is so necessary during hatching, the machines are usually  shut tightly and are not opened until the hatching is pretty well  completed unless it becomes necessary to add more moisture as indicated  above. The little ducklings should be left in the incubator until the  hatching is over and they are thoroughly dried off. As soon as the  hatching is completed, the ventilators in the machines are opened to  hasten the drying process. If the ducklings open their bills and pant  it is an indication that they are not getting enough ventilation and  this should be supplied by fastening the machine door open a little way.  If the ducks are not ready to be taken out of the machines by noon or  soon after, it is best to leave them until the next morning before  removing them to the brooder house. In the meantime, however, the old  eggs and shells and other refuse should be taken out. Usually the hatch  is completed in time so that the ducklings can be removed to the brooder  house on the afternoon of the 28th day. As a rule the earlier the hatch  is completed the better are the ducklings.    Figures secured on results in hatching for the entire season on Long  Island duck farms indicate that as a whole the duck raisers will not  average much over 40% hatch of all eggs set. Some hatches may run as  high as 60% or even more and in some"]]]
