Median part of upper lip bare; rest of mouth bordered by two rows  of short blunt papillae; lateral fold present; tooth-rows 2/3; upper  rows equal in length; second upper row broadly interrupted medially;  three lower rows complete, first and second rows equal in length,  slightly shorter than upper rows; third lower row noticeably shorter;  upper beak shallow, forming broad, continuous arch with slender lateral  processes; lower beak slender, broadly V-shaped, both beaks finely  serrate (Fig. 15B).    All six tadpoles are colored alike, except that in the larger specimens  scattered white flecks are present on the ventral surface of the body,  and the dark reticulations continue farther posteriorly on the caudal  fins than in the smaller tadpoles. In two specimens the third lower  tooth-row is only about one-half the length of the other lower rows, and  in one specimen the second lower tooth-row is shorter than the first.  Coloration of tadpoles in life: \"Body olive-brown with silvery green  flecks laterally. Caudal musculature olive-brown with greenish tan  flecks. Fins brown with greenish gold flecks. Iris deep bronze.\"  (Duellman, field notes, February 19, 1965).    One recently metamorphosed young (KU 91808) has a snout-vent length of  12.4 mm. In life this frog had a pale tan dorsum with dark brown  markings, yellowish tan posterior surfaces of thighs, grayish brown  throat, and bronze iris.    _Remarks._--The identity of Cope's _Hyla puma_ has not been known. The  name has appeared in various compilations, but no workers have referred  any of their specimens to that species. Examination of the holotype  (USNM 13735), an adult female, revealed the presence of the following  combination of characters: snout-vent length 45.8 mm., snout blunt above  and rounded laterally, nostrils close to tip of snout, lips thin and  flaring, a vestige of a web on the hands, feet about one-half webbed,  tarsal fold weak and extending about two-thirds length of tarsus, dorsal  markings consisting of a faded dark interorbital bar and a pair of faded  longitudinal brown marks connected by a transverse band in the scapular  region. The type agrees well with specimens of _Smilisca wellmanorum_  (Taylor, 1952); the vestigial webbing on the hands and the dorsal  coloration are especially significant. Consequently, we consider _Hyla  wellmanorum_ Taylor, 1952, to be a synonym of _Hyla puma_ Cope, 1885.  Cope gave only \"Nicaragua\" as the locality for _Hyla puma_. The specimen  was part of a collection received at the United States National Museum  from Lt. J. F. Moser. Among the species in the collection are  _Dentrobates pumilio_, _Phyllomedusa helenae_, _Corythophanes  cristatus_, _Pliocercus dimidatus_, _Tretanorhinus nigroluteus_, and  others characteristically found on the Caribbean lowlands of Central  America. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that the type specimen of  _Hyla puma_ came from the Caribbean lowlands. Though no other Nicaraguan  specimens have been found by us, numerous specimens are known from the  Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica.    Cochran (1961:58), in her catalogue of type specimens in the United  States National Museum, listed _Hyla puma_ Cope, 1885, as a synonym of  _Hyla molitor_ Schmidt, 1857. She made no qualifying statements. Schmidt  (1858:246), in his descriptions of the species in the year following his  publication of the names and Latin diagnoses, stated: \"Dorsum uniformly  gray, more intensive on back, fading away laterally and on extremities;  in every-day-life this blue would be called _Mueller's Blau_. A  delicately dotted black line runs on the canthus rostralis from the  opening of the nose to the corner of the eye. In the armpits, on the  flanks and the thighs two of our three specimens have black marblings.\"  [Free translation] Certainly on the basis of coloration _Hyla puma_ is  distinctly different from _Hyla molitor_.    _Distribution._--This species lives in the wet, forested regions of the  Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica and presumably southern Nicaragua (Fig.  3). All specimens are from low elevations; the highest known elevation  for the occurrence of this frog is 285 meters at Laguna Bonilla.        [Illustration: FIG. 3.

It had been a complaint against one of  my predecessors that he had been discourteous, and I determined that  the Manipuris should not have to complain of me on that score, and in  my letters I took care to be as courteous and considerate as possible.    On former occasions it had been the custom for a new political agent  to enter the capital unattended, and to call on the Maharajah the  next day, the latter repaying the visit a day later. This I did  not consider sufficient, and I determined that he should come out  to meet me in state. When Colonel McCulloch returned to Manipur the  second time, this had been done, Colonel McCulloch being an old and  intimate friend of the Maharajah. I quoted this as a precedent. I  tried in vain to get the Foreign Department to back up my request,  but could not induce them to interfere on my behalf, so I took the  responsibility on myself, and sent a formal demand to the Maharajah  to send a high officer--a major commanding a regiment--to meet me on  the road, and to meet me himself in state at a suitable distance from  the capital. The result will be described.    All being ready we left Shillong, my wife, nurse and children on men's  backs as before, for Cherra Poojee, where we arrived the second day;  thence, on the third day, we went to Thuria Ghat, on by boat via  Bholagunj, to Sylhet and Cachar. We reached Cachar on October 17th,  after passing the historical fort of Budderpore, where a battle was  fought with the Burmese in 1825, and settled down in the bungalow  of our kind friend Major Boyd who was away. Our coolies arrived on  October 18th, and we again packed our things and prepared to depart  on our final march.    We left Cachar for Manipur on October 20th, my wife and the nurse and  boys in \"doolies,\" a kind of tray four feet long by two in width,  with sides and ends eight inches in height, supported by two long  poles running along the bottom of each side, and slung at each end  to loose bars of wood carried on men's shoulders. The passenger sits  inside as best he can, and there is a light matting roof thrown over  to protect him from the weather. To begin with, it is an uncomfortable  and shaky conveyance, but in time one gets accustomed to it.    Our baggage was carried mostly on men's backs, each load varying from  sixty to seventy pounds in weight. Altogether we had, I daresay, one  hundred coolies, as everything we required for a ten days' journey had  to be carried, in addition to personal baggage and stores for our use  on arrival. I had provided a tent in case of need, but did not use it,  as rude huts were provided for us at all the stages along the road. Our  first halt was at Luckipore, in British territory, and, as usual,  the first march was the most trying; for servants, coolies, etc.,  have to learn each other's ways. I had an escort of one hundred men  of the 35th Native Infantry, under a subadar, as it was expected that  I might have to go on an expedition soon after my arrival, and these  men had their own special coolies, so we were a large party altogether.    We halted at Luckipore, as I have said, a few miles from the Hoorung  Hills and at Jeree Ghat. Next day we left British territory and entered  Manipur, where we found some huts built for our accommodation. At Jeree  Ghat the really interesting part of the journey commenced; thence, till  Bissenpore in the valley of Manipur is reached, the traveller marches  day after day over hills and across rivers. The first day from Jeree  Ghat we crossed the Noon-jai-bang range, the summit of which is 1800  to 1900 feet above the sea from whence a fine view of the next range,  Kala Naga or in Manipuri, Wy-nang-nong, is obtained. The road which  was made under the superintendence of Captain (afterwards Colonel)  Guthrie, of the Bengal Engineers between 1837 and 1844, at the joint  expense of the British and Manipuri Governments, the former paying  the larger share, was excellent for foot passengers and pack animals,  but not wide enough and too steep for wheeled traffic on a large scale.    After descending from Noong-jai-bang we halted on the banks of the  Mukker river amidst splendid forest, and next day ascended the Kala  Naga range and halted on the crest close to a Manipuri guard house  at a height of 3400 feet.    From this spot a magnificent view of the plains of Cachar is  obtained, and in fine weather, far beyond them the Kasia hills in the  neighbourhood of Cherra Poojee may be descried. The scene at sunset  is sometimes magnificent. In the foreground the dark forests, and in  the far distance a huge bank of golden clouds with their reflection  in the watery plain, and a mingled mass of colours, green fields,  purple, crimson, red and gold, all mixed up in such a way as no  painter would ever attempt to copy. As the sun sinks those colours  change and re-arrange themselves every minute in quick succession,  and when at last night closes in, the impression left on the mind is  one of never-ending wonder and admiration.    From Kala Naga to the Barak river is a very stiff descent, calculated  to shake the knees of an inexperienced hill-walker, and many is the  toe-nail lost by the pressure of one's boots. Here as at the Mukker  and other rivers farther on, the Barak is crossed by cane suspension  bridges, which vibrate and move at every step. In the dry season  these rivers are crossed by very cleverly constructed bamboo pontoon  bridges, but when the rainy season has commenced, they become raging  torrents, which nothing but a fish could live in, and but for the  suspension bridges, all communication with the outer world would be  cut off. The bridge over the Eerung river was one hundred yards in  length, and like all the others, was, when I first went to Manipur,  constructed entirely of cane and bamboo, and could by great exertions,  be finished in three days. During my period of office, wire ropes  were substituted for the two main cables on which all rested, and the  strength of the bridges greatly increased thereby. It was an important  part of my duty to see that both roads and bridges were kept in order.    Our march was interesting but uneventful. We started after breakfast  and generally reached our halting place in time for a late luncheon  or afternoon tea. Wherever we halted we had a hut to live in,  generally in some picturesque spot, one day giving a splendid view  of hill and valley with nothing but forests in view, on another we  were perched on a hill overlooking the beautiful Kowpoom valley,  a sheet of cultivation. At last, on the ninth day after crossing  the Lai-metol river, and ascending the Lai-metol, we had our first  view of the valley of Manipur [14] spread out like a huge map at our  feet. Seen as it was by us at the end of the rainy season, and from a  height of 2600 feet above it, is a vast expanse of flat land bordered  by hills, and mostly covered with water, through which the rice crops  are vigorously growing. To the south the Logtak lake is visible, with  several island hills in it, while far away to the north-east might be  seen the glittering roofs of the temples of Imphal, the capital. It  requires time to take in the view and to appreciate it. In the dry  season it looks very different with brown, dried-up hills in the  place of green.    The valley of Manipur possesses a few sacred groves, left, according to  the universal aboriginal custom, throughout all parts of India that I  have visited, for the wood spirits, when the land was first cleared;  but no natural forest. These groves are little isolated patches of  forest dotted here and there; the villages have plenty of planted  trees, many of great antiquity, and from the heights above they have  the appearance of woodland covered with grass. Besides this, all is one  sheet of cultivation or waste covered with grass. It was once entirely  cultivated, that is, before the Burmese invasion of 1819, when the  population of the valley, was from 500 to 1000 per square mile.    We halted to rest on the summit of the Lai-metol, and then descended,  passing sometimes under a kind of wild apple tree with very  eatable fruit, and once through a lovely grove of oak trees, called  \"Oui-ong-Moklung,\" and then, still far below us, saw some elephants  sent for us by the Maharajah. These elephants were posted at Sebok  Tannah, [15] a police station where the ground begins to grow level,  and a mile farther brought us to Bissenpore, where there was a rude  rest house. Here we halted for the night.    I have mentioned my demand that I should be met with proper  ceremony. It was of course stoutly resisted, every argument founded  on old custom, etc., being used against it. However, I stood firm, and  absolutely refused to go beyond Bissenpore, till the Maharajah gave me  an assurance that he would do all I required. In the end he gave in,  and a day before reaching that place, his uncle met me on the road with  a letter saying that all should be done as I wished. This official,  by name Samoo Major, became a great friend of mine, and remained so  till I finally left; he is, alas, I believe, now a prisoner in the  Andamans, having been supposed to be implicated in the rising in 1891.    The next day we left Bissenpore in good time, and marched the seventeen  miles to the capital, halting half-way at Phoiching, where I was  met by some officials. Farther on, some of still higher rank came  to greet me, and finally, at the entrance to the capital, I was met  by the Maharajah himself, surrounded by all his sons. A carpet was  spread with chairs for him and myself, we both of us having descended  from our elephants, advanced and met in the centre of the carpet,  and"]]]
