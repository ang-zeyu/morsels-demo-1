[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3165"],[0,"Rashi (#13)"],[1," They never  dreamed that antagonism might arise between faith and reason.  From a theological point of view-if the modern term may be  employed-Rashi shared the ideas of his time.  In knowledge or  character one may raise oneself above one's contemporaries; but  it is rare not to share their beliefs and superstitions.  Now, it  must be admitted, the Jews of Northern France did not cherish  religion in all its ideal purity.  The effect of their faith,  their piety, upon these simple souls was to make them somewhat  childish, and give their practices a somewhat superstitious  tinge.  Thus, Rashi says in the name of his teacher Jacob ben  Yakar, that one should smell spices Saturday evening, because  hell, after having its work interrupted by the Sabbath, begins to  exhale a bad odor again in the evening.  This naive faith at  least preserved Rashi from pursuing the paths not always avoided  by his co-religionists of Spain and the Provence, who dabbled in  philosophy.  Rashi never was conscious of the need to justify  certain narratives or certain beliefs which shocked some readers  of the Bible.  Not until he came upon a passage in the Talmud  which awakened his doubts did he feel called upon to explain why  God created humanity, though He knew it would become corrupt, and  why He asks for information concerning things which cannot escape  His omniscience.  But Rashi was not bewildered by certain  anthropomorphic passages in the Bible, the meaning of which so  early a work as the Targum had veiled.  Nor was he shocked by the  fact that God let other peoples adore the stars, and that altars  had been consecrated to Him elsewhere than at Jerusalem.  Thus his  plain common sense kept him from wandering along by-paths and  losing himself in the subtleties in which the Ibn Ezras and the  Nahmanides were entangled.  His common sense rendered him the  same service in the interpretation of many a Talmudic passage  that Saadia and Nissim had thought incapable of explanation  unless wrested from its literal meaning.  Since justice requires  the admission, I shall presently dwell upon the points in which  Rashi's lack of philosophic training was injurious to him.  Here  it is necessary merely to note wherein it was useful to him.  It  was not he, for instance, who held Abraham and Moses to have been  the precursors-no, the disciples-of Aristotle.  Ought we to  complain of that?    In discussing the fundamental goodness of Rashi's nature, no  reserves nor qualifications need be made.  Historians have vied  with one another in praising his humanity, his kindliness, his  indulgent, charitable spirit, his sweetness, and his benevolence.  He appealed to the spirit of concord, and exhorted the  communities to live in peace with one another.  His goodness  appears in the following Responsum to a question, which the  interrogator did not sign: \"I recognized the author of the  letter by the writing.  He feared to sign his name, because he  suspects me of being hostile to him.  But I assure him I am not;  I have quite the contrary feeling for him.\" A still quainter  characteristic is illustrated by the following decision which he  rendered: \"If, during the prayer after a meal, one interrupts  oneself to feed an animal, one does not commit a reprehensible  act, for one should feed one's beasts before taking nourishment,  as it is written: 'And I will send grass in thy fields for thy  cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.'\" But the quality Rashi  possessed in the highest degree was simplicity, modesty, one may  almost say, humility; and what contributed not a little to the  even tenor of his existence was his capacity for self-effacement.    Such was his nature even when a youth in the academies of  Lorraine.  He himself tells how once, when he was in the house of  his teacher, he noticed that a ritual prescription was being  violated in dressing the meat of a sheep.  His teacher, occupied  with other matters, did not notice the infringement of the law,  and the pupil was in a quandary.  To keep quiet was to cover up  the wrong and make it irreparable; to speak and pronounce a  decision before his master was to be lacking in respect for him.  So, to escape from the embarrassing situation, Rashi put a  question to his master bearing upon the dressing of the meat.    Toward all his teachers Rashi professed the greatest respect.  On  a certain question they held wrong opinions, and Rashi wrote: \"I  am sure they did not cause irremediable harm, but they will do  well in the future to abstain from such action.\" This shows at  the same time that Rashi did not hesitate to be independent, did  not blindly accept all their teachings.  When he believed an  opinion wrong, he combated it; when he believed an opinion right,  he upheld it, even against his masters.  On one occasion, Isaac  ha-Levi delivered a sentence which to his pupil seemed too  strict.  \"I plied him with questions,\" says Rashi, \"to which he  would not pay attention, although he could not give any proof in  support of his opinion.\" To the pupils of Isaac, he wrote: \"I do  not pretend to abolish the usages that you follow, but as soon  as I can be with you, I shall ask you to come over to my opinion.  I do not wish to discuss the stricter practices adopted in the  school of Jacob ben Yakar (Isaac's predecessor), until I shall  have established that my idea is the correct one.  He will then  acknowledge that I am right, as he did once before.\"    This is the circumstance referred to.  While still a pupil of  Isaac ha-Levi, Rashi had accepted a decision of his without  having thoroughly studied it.  Later he became convinced that his  teacher was mistaken, but he bore it in mind until he went to  Worms and persuaded his teacher to his own belief.    Rashi displayed the same reserve in the exercise of his  rabbinical functions, especially when the community appealing to  him was not that of Troyes.  That of Chalons-sur-Saone once  consulted him concerning an interdiction imposed by R. Gershom,  and asked him to repeal it; but Rashi modestly declined to give  an opinion.[29]    Rashi's modesty is also illustrated by the tone of his  correspondence.  Deferential or indulgent, he never adopted a  superior manner, was never positive or dogmatic.  When his  correspondents were wrong, he sought to justify their mistakes;  when he combated the explanation of another, he never used a  cutting expression, or a spiteful allusion, as Ibn Ezra did, and  so many others.    Finally, it seems, he did not hesitate to recognize his own  mistakes, even when a pupil pointed them out to him, and it is  possible to select from his commentaries a number of avowals of  error.  In his Responsa he wrote: \"The same question has already  been put to me, and I gave a faulty answer.  But now I am  convinced of my mistake, and I am prepared to give a decision  better based on reason.  I am grateful to you for having drawn my  attention to the question; thanks to you, I now see the truth.\"  This question concerned a point in Talmudic law; but he was  willing to make a similar admission in regard to the explanation  of a Biblical verse.  \"In commenting on Ezekiel I made a mistake  in the explanation of this passage, and as, at the end of the  chapter, I gave the true sense, I contradicted myself.  But in  taking up the question again with my friend Shemaiah,[30] I  hastened to correct this mistake.\"    An old scholar named R. Dorbal, or Durbal, addressed a question  to Rashi, and Rashi in his reply expressed his astonishment that  an old man should consult so young a man as he.  Assuredly, said  Rashi, it was because he wanted to give a proof of his  benevolence and take the occasion for congratulating Rashi on his  response, if it were correct.    It would take too long to enumerate all the passages in which  Rashi avows his ignorance, and declares he cannot give a  satisfactory explanation.    We have seen that Rashi did not hesitate to acknowledge that he  owed certain information to his friends and pupils, and that his  debates with them had sometimes led him to change his opinion.  The confession he made one day to his grandson Samuel about the  inadequacy of his Biblical Commentary[31] has become celebrated,  and justly so.  There is something touching in the way he listened  to the opinions of his grandson, and accepted them because  they appeared correct to him-the man who loved truth and science  above everything else.  Like many noble spirits, he considered  his work imperfect, and would have liked to do it all over again.  This modesty and this realization of the truth are the ruling  qualities of his nature.                                   II    The ideal Jew combines virtue with knowledge, and tradition  ascribes to Rashi universal knowledge.  In the first place he was  a polyglot.  Popular admiration of him, based upon the myth  concerning his travels and upon a superficial reading of this  works, assigned to him the old miracle of the Apostles.  The  languages he was supposed to know were Latin, Greek, Arabic, and  Persian.  He was also said to be acquainted with astronomy, and  even with the Kabbalah, of which, according to the Kabbalists, he  was an ardent adept.  After his death, they say, he appeared to  his grandson Samuel to teach him the true pronunciation of the  Ineffable Name.  Medical knowledge was also attributed to Rashi,  and a medical work ascribed to his authorship.  One scholar went  so far as to call him a calligrapher.[32] From his infancy, it  was declared, he astonished the world by his learning and by his  memory; and when, toward the end of his life, he went to Barcelona,  he awakened every one's admiration by his varied yet profound  knowledge.    These errors, invented, or merely repeated, but, at all events,  given credence by the Jewish chroniclers and the Christian  bibliographers, cannot hold out against the assaults of  criticism.

Never find fault with your wife under any circumstances; let your  intellect discover a way to better things if need be. A really wise man  will never allow a harsh word to escape his lips to a loving wife, or  to his harmless children. By so living together a wise husband and a  loving wife will soon discover that they two are but complemental to  each other--like the Will and Understanding of one individual.          CHAPTER IX.    TO THE UNFORTUNATE.      Let no one imagine that, because he or she has committed any of the  great errors enumerated in former chapters, there is no hopeful future.  Such a conclusion need not, necessarily, be accepted. In very many cases  where there is a _will_ to reform, there is also a _way_; and very often  a complete cure and restoration to health may be effected. Diseased  bones may be made sound; ulcerations healed; sore throats cured;  blemishes on the skin removed; urinary difficulties may be dissipated or  at least greatly ameliorated; sexual disorders remedied; impaired eyes  much improved and defective vision much benefited if not wholly  restored; the auditory apparatus helped if not fully cured; and the  distracted mind, with its fanciful imageries, rendered tranquil and  rational.    To accomplish all this the _mind_ must lead the way. The brain must  assert its supremacy, and the will-power become absolute. It is only  where there is a will, an indomitable will, that a way out of these  direful difficulties is afforded. Let happen what may, no opposing  influences should dampen the determination to press forward to  reformation; and then, sooner or later, the conquest will be made.    To begin with, when the mind is fully determined to overcome all  obstacles or perish in the attempt, consult a judicious physician as  advised in the preface of this book. Lose no time with quackery in any  shape or form. Do not be beguiled by those who promise \"a speedy cure.\"  Speedy cures cannot be made in these cases. Strong determination to  improve aided by proper medication can, in bad cases, only restore a  healthful condition in from two to three years. The system requires to  be made over anew as it were. The current of life must be turned into  new channels. New thoughts and new blood must be made to take the place  of what were wrong and polluted. This will take time and perseverance;  and then, little by little the old enemies will be overcome and driven  out. But progress for the better must be measured only from month to  month and even then there may be apparent relapses. Let me however  asseverate, from my abundance of experience in these cases, that there  is ultimately, after a reasonable time, every hope of becoming sound  and healthy again.    Many young persons are rendered quite distracted by the sexual  instinct being too strong. It infests them and goads them on to the  commission of further unseemly acts--though suffering much from past  transgressions--which it seems almost impossible to avoid. The sensation  haunts and clings to them day and night, in spite of every attempt to  rise superior thereto. Sometimes nocturnal pollutions, or \"wet dreams,\"  as they are commonly termed, result from these or other causes. There  must be some cause for this state of things and a rigid examination into  one's mode of life should ascertain the same. It may come from errors in  diet, in eating or drinking; in the use of highly seasoned food; or the  taking of some medicinal drug substance. It is well known that many  drugs have the power of producing such a condition. Should any of the  above seem to act as causes, a change should be made at once. The  plainest diet and simplest mode of life is always best in sickness or in  health. Again, one may take too little exercise in the open air. If so,  an abundance of physical exertion should be made daily, to insure a  natural and healthy condition of all organs of the body. Or, uncomfortable  conditions may arise, as they often do, from some morbid condition of  the vital forces. If diet and exercise are insufficient, the judicious  physician should be consulted and every symptom or unnatural sensation  from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet, should be carefully  described to him. In all probability he will remedy the trouble, thus  restoring peace and happiness. The generative organs are as liable to be  affected by a morbid state of the vital forces, as are any other organs  of the body; and when so affected they are just as amenable to  treatment.    The above condition of affairs is not, however, confined to the male  sex. Females often suffer equally and in the same way. Many young  persons, of both sexes, have fallen victims to these disorders who could  have been cured by proper medical treatment. A female suffering from the  ill effects of any bad habit contracted in youth, or from any sexual or  venereal disorder, should seek medical aid with the same promptness and  openness of heart as a male. To overcome the vicious habit of self-abuse  is no trifling matter; it will require the persistent application of  indomitable will, aided by Christianity--by oft repeated appeals to the  Lord for aid, who lends a willing ear and a helping hand to the poor  and needy. When reformation is determined upon, it is better to consult  a physician at once and act under his advice. Besides directing the  proper diet and plenty of vigorous exercise in the open air, he will  prescribe the proper medicament.    Cases of real syphilitic poisoning are most serious affections, and  everyone should know of the fearful effects of this poison--how  searchingly it infests the whole system, and how it contaminates the  blood and every tissue in the body. Such cases, therefore, should not be  trifled with in any way. Advertised nostrums should be particularly  avoided. For, if this poison be simply smothered in one's blood instead  of being wholly eradicated and cured, it will be sure to seize upon the  offspring and either destroy them before birth or during dentition. The  bare fear of such contamination should be amply sufficient to deter  everyone from exposing him- or herself to the risk. But, having fallen,  by all means seek the aid of a judicious physician. An experience of  nearly forty years in the treatment of these cases, in both sexes, has  given me the power to know whereof I speak; and I do declare that a very  large percentage of these cases can be cured in a safe manner; and so  perfectly cured too, that there will be no danger of transmitting the  infection to the offspring. I, by no means stand alone in this statement;  many other physicians, after long years of experience assert the same  truth.    Therefore, let no one be discouraged, no matter how far he, or she, has  strayed from the paths of virtue or how much suffering has been entailed  thereby. In connection with the physician's help, aid yourself. Have  courage! Let the invincible will lead on unflinchingly--upheld by pure  thoughts, and good actions will surely follow. \"Desire is really  dangerous only when it brings voluptuous pictures incessantly before the  imagination. It thus holds a thousand conflicts with virtue which it  conquers in the end; it installs itself in the bosom of the intelligence  of which it becomes the habitual pre-occupation.\" Seek therefore for  only pure thoughts.    We should at all times exert all the power within us to live correct and  blameless lives in every respect, but particularly so in sexual matters.  The happiness, the health, and the lives of families and communities are  far more largely dependent upon these matters than is commonly supposed.  Those who have led lives of blameless purity, will continue to do so  after reading this book; while those who have gone astray will here find  every encouragement to set about their reformation at once. If faithful  to the teachings recorded in these pages they will bless the day and the  occasion that inspired the writer to put his hand to this work. The God  of Heaven and Earth knows that the motive that led me to this undertaking  was pure, and as solely for the good of humanity, as that purity which  prompts a human being to live a blameless life in the sight of his Maker.          CHAPTER X.    ORIGIN OF THE SEX.    From Whence does the Sex Proceed and What Determines It?      So much has been written about this matter, and so many foolish, low,  and really debasing theories and speculations have been advanced in  relation thereto, that I deem it expedient at this time, and in this  place, to put forth the true theory of the reproduction of the sexes,  one that can endure the test of the most rigid scientific investigation.  The only theory upon this subject worthy of notice, must be based upon a  principle that will hold good and true throughout all animated nature,  not only in the animal, but in the vegetable kingdom as well.    The earth is the common mother of the vegetable world; seeds of all  kinds fall into her and she brings forth male and female plants  according to the seeds planted. The _earth_ certainly does not give the  sex to plants for they come forth according to the life inherent in the  seed; if this life-force be male, the plant must be male; and if the  life-force of the seed be female, the product must be a female plant.  The earth can possibly bring forth no other sex than that which the  life-force of the seed impels.    This is true in the animal creation. Within the female grows the seed  given her by the male, be it male or female, and she can grow none  other. In other words the male as is very evident on mature reflection  gives the soul or the inmost vital principle, and the female clothes  that soul, or gives it a body in which to operate. What else can the  male do; what office does he perform, if it is"]]]
