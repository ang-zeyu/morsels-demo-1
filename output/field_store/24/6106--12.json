Take them out, brush over  them a thin solution of gum and dust them with powdered sugar to  represent frosting. Before putting the cream in the basins, shake a  little icing sugar over the basins, it will keep them from sticking.      RASPBERRY NOYEAU.      5 lbs. White Sugar.    1 lb. Glucose.    2 lbs. Raspberry Jam.    1 lb. Almonds, blanched and Dried.    3 pints Water.    Liquid Brilliant Rose Color.    PROCESS.--Boil the sugar, glucose and water to the ball degree, 250;  ease the pan off the fire, add the jam and almonds, with sufficient  color to make the whole a bright red; let the batch boil through,  keeping it stirred gently until thoroughly mixed; now remove the pan  from the fire and see if the batch has turned opaque; if not rub some of  the syrup against the side of the pan and stir until whole boil shows a  little creamy, then pour out on wafer paper, keeping the sheet about  three-quarters of an inch thick; level the top down with pallette knife  and cover with wafer paper; when set remove to a clean board and cut  into bars with a sharp knife. In running sheets to thickness, arrange  the loose bars on the pouring plate to form a square in proportion to  the size of the boil. Almost any kind of jam can be substituted for  flavoring Noyeau.      WHAT TO DO WITH SCRAPS AND SIFTINGS.    It is necessary to know how to use up the scraps, siftings, spoiled boil  candies and otherwise unsaleable goods. People who make jam or  liquorice goods know of course what to do with them; but small makers  often accumulate lots of waste which seems always in the way. This  should be avoided as much as possible, not only on the ground of  economy, but for the good order and general appearance of the workshop.  Keep the acid scraps separate from the others; have two pans  (earthenware will do) and make it a rule, when sweeping down the plates,  to throw the acid scraps into one pan and the others into the second  pan; keep them well covered with water, and, as the syrup then gets too  thick, put in more water in order that the scraps may dissolve. When  making dark goods such as cough candy, cough drops, cocoanut candy,  stick jaw, etc., use a proportion of this syrup in each boil, dipping it  out with a ladle. As a rule a careful workman would use up his scraps  every day. Some use the machine scraps by putting them in the next boil  when sugar is on the slab. The writer's experience is that that method  is objectionable, as it not only causes the boil to be cloudy, but very  often grains it. Melt the acid scraps in water enough to form a thin  syrup; put in some whiting, powdered chalk or lime; put the pan on the  fire and stir until whole boils; see that all the scraps are dissolved;  remove the pan and let it stand for an hour, then strain through  flannel. Use this syrup in the same way as the other for making common  goods.      CREAM FOR CHOCOLATE CREAMS OR BARS.      10 lbs. White Sugar.    3 pints Water.    2-1/2 lbs. Glucose.    PROCESS.--Put the sugar, glucose and water in a clean pan and boil in  the usual way until the batch reaches the degree of feather 245; (keep  the sides of the pan free from sugar); pour out on damp pouring plate  and let it remain till nearly cold; then with long pallette knife  commence to rub the sugar against the plate and work it about until it  changes from a clear syrup to snow white creamy substance; then knead it  with the hand until of uniform softness and no lumps left in the mass;  it is now ready for use and may be kept covered in stoneware jars until  required for various purposes. In winter the sugar need not be boiled so  high; in hot weather, a little higher. When packing the cream away in  jars it is better to keep the top moist by laying on a damp cloth before  putting in the cork. Seeing that cream keeps so well, of course it is  saving to make much larger batches at a time. This can be easily  arranged by multiplying the proportions according to size of pan and  convenience. These proportions are a guide, but the writer knows of no  absolute must be this or that, although he has made as many cream goods  as most people and with as much success. He has seen as fine a sample  made in the same workshop when the boil was made up a little different.  However, in submitting his own formula, it may be taken for granted he  is not a mile from the bull's eye.    [Illustration: Fig. 17.    Chocolate Melter or Warmer.

Bingo trotted amiably alongside and licked the wolf's nose.    We were astounded, and shouted to urge Bingo on. Our shouting and  approach several times started the wolf off at speed and Bingo again  pursued until he had overtaken it, but his gentleness was too obvious.    \"It is a she-wolf, he won't harm her,\" I exclaimed as the truth dawned  on me. And Gordon said: \"Well, I be darned.\"    So we called our unwilling dog and drove on.    For weeks after this we were annoyed by the depredations of a prairie  wolf who killed our chickens, stole pieces of pork from the end of the  house, and several times terrified the children by looking into the  window of the shanty while the men were away.    Against this animal Bingo seemed to be no safeguard. At length the wolf,  a female, was killed, and then Bingo plainly showed his hand by his  lasting enmity toward Oliver, the man who did the deed.    VI    It is wonderful and beautiful how a man and his dog will stick to one  another, through thick and thin. Butler tells of an undivided Indian  tribe, in the Far North which was all but exterminated by an internecine  feud over a dog that belonged to one man and was killed by his neighbor;  and among ourselves we have lawsuits, fights, and deadly feuds, all  pointing the same old moral, 'Love me, love my dog.'    One of our neighbors had a very fine hound that he thought the best and  dearest dog in the world. I loved him, so I loved his dog, and when  one day poor Tan crawled home terribly mangled and died by the door, I  joined my threats of vengeance with those of his master and thenceforth  lost no opportunity of tracing the miscreant, both by offering rewards  and by collecting scraps of evidence. At length it was clear that one of  three men to the southward had had a hand in the cruel affair. The scent  was warming up, and soon we should have been in a position to exact  rigorous justice, at least, from the wretch who had murdered poor old  Tan.    Then something took place which at once changed my mind and led me  to believe that the mangling of the old hound was not by any means an  unpardonable crime, but indeed on second thoughts was rather commendable  than otherwise.    Gordon Wright's farm lay to the south of us, and while there one day,  Gordon Jr., knowing that I was tracking the murderer, took me aside and  looking about furtively, he whispered, in tragic tones:    \"It was Bing done it.\"    And the matter dropped right there. For I confess that from that moment  I did all in my power to baffle the justice I had previously striven so  hard to further. I had given Bingo away long before, but the feeling of  ownership did not die; and of this indissoluble fellowship of dog and  man he was soon to take part in another important illustration.    Old Gordon and Oliver were close neighbors and friends; they joined in  a contract to cut wood, and worked together harmoniously till late on in  winter. Then Oliver's old horse died, and he, determining to profit as  far as possible, dragged it out on the plain and laid poison baits for  wolves around it. Alas for poor Bingo! He would lead a wolfish life,  though again and again it brought him into wolfish misfortunes.    He was as fond of dead horse as any of his wild kindred. That very  night, with Wright's own dog Curley, he visited the carcass. It seemed  as though Bing had busied himself chiefly keeping off the wolves, but  Curley feasted immoderately. The tracks in the snow told the story of  the banquet; the interruption as the poison began to work, and of  the dreadful spasms of pain during the erratic course back home where  Curley, falling in convulsions at Gordon's feet, died in the greatest  agony.    'Love me, love my dog,' No explanations or apology were acceptable;  it was useless to urge that it was accidental; the long-standing feud  between Bingo and Oliver was now remembered as an important sidelight.  The wood-contract was thrown up, all friendly relations ceased, and to  this day there is no county big enough to hold the rival factions which  were called at once into existence and to arms by Curley's dying yell.    It was months before Bingo really recovered from the poison. We believed  indeed that he never again would be the sturdy old-time Bingo. But when  the spring came he began to gain strength, and bettering as the grass  grew, he was within a few weeks once more in full health and vigor to be  a pride to his friends and a nuisance to his neighbors.    VII    Changes took me far away from Manitoba, and on my return in 1886 Bingo  was still a member of Wright's household. I thought he would have  forgotten me after two years' absence, but not so. One day early in the  winter, after having been lost for forty-eight hours, he crawled home to  Wright's with a wolf-trap and a heavy log fast to one foot, and the foot  frozen to stony hardness. No one had been able to approach to help him,  he was so savage, when I, the stranger now, stooped down and laid hold  of the trap with one hand and his leg with the other. Instantly he  seized my wrist in his teeth.    Without stirring I said, \"Bing, don't you know me?\"    He had not broken the skin and at once released his hold and offered no  further resistance, although he whined a good deal during the removal of  the trap. He still acknowledged me his master in spite of his change  of residence and my long absence, and notwithstanding my surrender of  ownership I still felt that he was my dog.    Bing was carried into the house much against his will and his frozen  foot thawed out. During the rest of the winter he went lame and two of  his toes eventually dropped off. But before the return of warm weather  his health and strength were fully restored, and to a casual glance he  bore no mark of his dreadful experience in the steel trap.    VIII    During that same winter I caught many wolves and foxes who did not have  Bingo's good luck in escaping the traps, which I kept out right into the  spring, for bounties are good even when fur is not.    Kennedy's Plain was always a good trapping ground because it was  unfrequented by man and yet lay between the heavy woods and the  settlement. I had been fortunate with the fur here, and late in April  rode in on one of my regular rounds.    The wolf-traps are made of heavy steel and have two springs, each of one  hundred pounds power. They are set in fours around a buried bait, and  after being strongly fastened to concealed logs are carefully covered in  cotton and in fine sand so as to be quite invisible. A prairie wolf was  caught in one of these. I killed him with a club and throwing him aside  proceeded to reset the trap as I had done so many hundred times before.  All was quickly done. I threw the trap-wrench over toward the pony, and  seeing some fine sand nearby, I reached out for a handful of it to add a  good finish to the setting.    Oh, unlucky thought! Oh, mad heedlessness born of long immunity! That  fine sand was on the next wolftrap and in an instant I was a prisoner.  Although not wounded, for the traps have no teeth, and my thick trapping  gloves deadened the snap, I was firmly caught across the hand above the  knuckles. Not greatly alarmed at this, I tried to reach the trap-wrench  with my right foot. Stretching out at full length, face downward, I  worked myself toward it, making my imprisoned arm as long and straight  as possible. I could not see and reach at the same time, but counted on  my toe telling me when I touched the little iron key to my fetters. My  first effort was a failure; strain as I might at the chain my toe struck  no metal. I swung slowly around my anchor, but still failed. Then a  painfully taken observation showed I was much too far to the west. I set  about working around, tapping blindly with my toe to discover the key.  Thus wildly groping with my right foot I forgot about the other till  there was a sharp 'clank' and the iron jaws of trap No. 5 closed tight  on my left foot.    The terrors of the situation did not, at first, impress me, but I soon  found that all my struggles were in vain. I could not get free from  either trap or move the traps together, and there I lay stretched out  and firmly staked to the ground.    What would become of me now? There was not much danger of freezing for  the cold weather was over, but Kennedy's Plain was never visited by the  winter wood-cutters. No one knew where I had gone, and unless I could  manage to free myself there was no prospect ahead but to be devoured by  wolves, or else die of cold and starvation.    As I lay there the red sun went down over the spruce swamp west of the  plain, and a shorelark on a gopher mound a few yards off twittered his  evening song, just as one had done the night before at our shanty door,  and though the numb pains were creeping up my arm, and a deadly chill  possessed me, I noticed how long his little ear-tufts were. Then my  thoughts went to the comfortable supper-table at Wright's shanty, and I  thought, now they are frying the pork for supper, or just sitting  down. My pony still stood as I left him with his bridle on the ground  patiently waiting to take me home. He did not understand the long delay,  and when I called, he ceased nibbling the grass and looked at me in  dumb, helpless inquiry. If he would only go home the empty saddle might  tell the tale and bring help. But his very faithfulness kept him waiting  hour after hour while I was perishing of cold and hunger.    Then I remembered how old Girou the trapper had been lost, and in the  following spring his comrades found his skeleton held by the leg in a  bear-trap. I wondered which part of my clothing would show my identity.  Then a new thought came to me. This is how a wolf feels when he is  trapped. Oh! what misery have I been responsible for! Now I'm to pay for  it.    Night came slowly on. A prairie wolf howled, the pony"]]]
