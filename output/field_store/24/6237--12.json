She told him that  she thought she heard some one walking about and was afraid, for she  was alone with her four little girls.    He told her she ought not to be afraid with all her children round her.  But night after night she sat up crying: \"Wyah, wyah, Deereeree,  Deereeree.\"    At last Bibbee said! \"If you are so frightened, marry me and live in my  camp. I will take care of you.\" But Deereeree said she did not want to  marry. So night after night was to be heard her plaintive cry of \"Wyah,  wyah, Deereeree, Deereeree.\" And again and again Bibbee pressed her to  share his camp and marry him. But she always refused. The more she  refused the more he wished to marry her. And he used to wonder how he  could induce her to change her mind.    At last he thought of a plan of surprising her into giving her consent.  He set to work and made a beautiful and many coloured arch, which, when  it was made, he called Euloowirree, and he placed it right across the  sky, reaching from one side of the earth to the other. When the rainbow  was firmly placed in the sky, and showing out in all its brilliancy, of  many colours, as a roadway from the earth to the stars, Bibbee went  into his camp to wait. When Deereeree looked up at the sky and saw the  wonderful rainbow, she thought something dreadful must be going to  happen. She was terribly frightened, and called aloud: \"Wyah, wyah.\" In  her fear she gathered her children together, and fled with them to  Bibbee's camp for protection.    Bibbee proudly told her that he had made the rainbow, just to show how  strong he was and how safe she would be if she married him. But if she  would not, she would see what terrible things he would make to come on  the earth, not just a harmless and beautiful roadway across the  heavens, but things that would burst from the earth and destroy it.    So by working on her mixed feelings of fear of his prowess, and  admiration of his skill, Bibbee gained his desire, and Deereeree  married him. And when long afterwards they died, Deereeree was changed  into the little willy wagtail who may be heard through the stillness of  the summer nights, crying her plaintive wail of \"Deereeree, wyah, wyah,  Deereeree.\"    And Bibbee was changed into the woodpecker, or climbing tree bird, who  is always running up trees as if he wanted to be building other ways to  the than the famous roadway of his Euloowirree, the building of which  had won him his wife.          24.  MOOREGOO THE MOPOKE, AND MOONINGUGGAHGUL THE MOSQUITO BIRD      An old man lived with his two wives, the Mooninguggahgul sisters, and  his two sons. The old man spent all his time making boomerangs, until  at last he had four nets full of these weapons. The two boys used to go  out hunting opossums and iguanas, which they would cook in the bush,  and eat, without thinking of bringing any home to their parents. The  old man asked them one day to bring him home some fat to rub his  boomerangs with. This the boys did, but they brought only the fat,  having eaten the rest of the iguanas from which they had taken the fat.  The old man was very angry that his sons were so greedy, but he said  nothing, though he determined to punish them, for he thought \"when they  were young, and could not hunt, I hunted for them and fed them well;  now that they can hunt and I am old and cannot so well, they give me  nothing.\" Thinking of his treatment at the hands of his sons, he  greased all his boomerangs, and when he had finished them he said to  the boys: \"You take these boomerangs down on to the plain and try them;  see if I have made them well. Then come back and tell me. I will stay  here.\"    The boys took the boomerangs. They threw them one after another; but to  their surprise not one of the boomerangs they threw touched the ground,  but, instead, went whirling up out of sight. When they had finished  throwing the boomerangs, all of which acted in the same way, whirling  up through space, they prepared to start home again. But as they looked  round they saw a huge whirlwind coming towards them. They were  frightened and called out \"Wurrawilberoo,\" for they knew there was a  devil in the whirlwind. They laid hold of trees near at hand that it  might not catch them. But the whirlwind spread out first one arm and  rooted up one tree, then another arm, and rooted up another. The boys  ran in fear from tree to tree, but each tree that they went to was torn  up by the whirlwind. At last they ran to two mubboo or beef-wood trees,  and clung tightly to them. After them rushed the whirlwind, sweeping  all before it, and when it reached the mubboo trees, to which the boys  were clinging, it tore them from their roots and bore them upward  swiftly, giving the boys no time to leave go, so they were borne upward  clinging to the mubboo trees. On the whirlwind bore them until they  reached the sky, where it placed the two trees with the boys still  clinging to them. And there they still are, near the Milky Way, and  known as Wurrawilberoo. The boomerangs are scattered all along the  Milky Way, for the whirlwind had gathered them all together in its rush  through space. Having placed them all in the sky, down came the  whirlwind, retaking its natural shape, which was that of the old man,  for so had he wreaked his vengeance on his sons for neglecting their  parents.    As time went on, the mothers wondered why their sons did not return. It  struck them as strange that the old man expressed no surprise at the  absence of the boys, and they suspected that he knew more than he cared  to say. For he only sat in the camp smiling while his wives discussed  what could have happened to them, and he let the women go out and  search alone. The mothers tracked their sons to the plain. There they  saw that a big whirlwind had lately been, for trees were uprooted and  strewn in every direction. They tracked their sons from tree to tree  until at last they came to the place where the mubboos had stood. They  saw the tracks of their sons beside the places whence the trees had  been uprooted, but of the trees and their sons they saw no further  trace. Then they knew that they had all been borne up together by the  whirlwind, and taken whither they knew not. Sadly they returned to  their camp. When night came they heard cries which they recognised as  made by the voices of their sons, though they sounded as if coming from  the sky. As the cries sounded again the mothers looked up whence they  came, and there they saw the mubboo trees with their sons beside them.  Then well they knew that they would see no more their sons on earth,  and great was their grief, and wroth were they with their husband, for  well they knew now that he must have been the devil in the whirlwind,  who had so punished the boys. They vowed to avenge the loss of their  boys.    The next day they went out and gathered a lot of pine gum, and brought  it back to the camp. When they reached the camp the old man called to  one of his wives to come and tease his hair, as his head ached, and  that alone would relieve the pain. One of the women went over to him,  took his head on her lap, and teased his hair until at last the old man  was soothed and sleepy. In the meantime the other wife was melting the  gum. The one with the old man gave her a secret sign to come near; then  she asked the old man to lie on his back, that she might tease his  front hair better. As he did so, she signed to the other woman, who  quickly came, gave her some of the melted gum, which they both then  poured hot into his eyes, filling them with it. In agony the old man  jumped up and ran about, calling out, \"Mooregoo, mooregoo,\" as he ran.  Out of the camp he ran and far away, still crying out in his agony, as  he went. And never again did his wives see him though every night they  heard his cry of \"Mooregoo, mooregoo.\" But though they never saw their  husband, they saw a night hawk, the Mopoke, and as that cried always,  \"Mooregoo, moregoo,\" as their husband had cried in his agony, they knew  that he must have turned into the bird.    After a time the women were changed into Mooninguggahgul, or mosquito  birds. These birds arc marked on the wings just like a mosquito, and  every summer night you can hear them cry out incessantly,  \"Mooninguggahgul,\" which cry is the call for the mosquitoes to answer  by coming out and buzzing in chorus. And as quickly the mosquitoes come  out in answer to the summons, the Mooninguggahgul bid them fly  everywhere and bite all they can.          25.  BOUGOODOOGAHDAH THE RAIN BIRD      Bougoodoogahdah was all old woman who lived alone with her four hundred  dingoes. From living so long with these dogs she had grown not to care  for her fellow creatures except as food. She and the dogs lived on  human flesh, and it was her cunning which gained such food for them  all. She would sally forth from her camp with her two little dogs; she  would be sure to meet some black fellows, probably twenty or thirty,  going down to the creek. She would say, \"I can tell you where there are  lots of paddy melons.\" They would ask where, and she would answer,  \"Over there, on the point of that moorillah or ridge. If you will go  there and have your nullahs ready, I will go with my two dogs and round  them up towards you.\"    The black fellows invariably stationed themselves where she had told  them, and off went Bougoodoogahdah and her two dogs. But not to round  up the paddy melons. She went quickly towards her camp, calling softly,  \"Birree, gougou,\" which meant \"Sool 'em, sool 'em,\" and was the signal  for the dogs to come out. Quickly they came and surrounded the black  fellows, took them by surprise, flew at them, bit and worried them to  death. Then they and Bougoodoogahdah dragged the bodies to their camp.  There they were cooked and were food for the old woman and the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38356"],[0,"Speciation of the Wandering Shrew (#13)"],[1,"ft, 7  BS, 1 UM.    _Marginal records._--NEW MEXICO: SW slope Capitan Mts.; 10 mi.

[= Pinaleno      Mts.] Graham Co., Arizona.    _Type._--Adult male, skin and skull; No. 17599/24535, U. S. Biol.  Surv. Coll.; obtained on August 28, 1899, by C. Hart Merriam and  Vernon Bailey from San Francisco Mtn., 11,500 ft., Coconino Co.,  Arizona.    _Range._--Mountains of western New Mexico, eastern Arizona, and the  northern Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico.    _Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; average and extreme  measurements of 12 specimens from the White Mountains, Arizona, are:  total length, 104.3 (98-112); tail, 41.2 (37-45); hind foot, 12.0  (11-13). Summer pelage between (15'_m_) Proutts Brown and (15''_m_)  Bister, venter tinged with (15'_f_) Pale Ochraceous Buff; winter  pelage near (17'''_k_) Olive Brown; skull relatively broad.    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _S. v. obscurus_ and _S. v.  neomexicanus_ see accounts of those subspecies. Skull slightly larger  and relatively broader than that of _S. v. orizabae_, and color  slightly paler. Differs from _S. v. vagrans_ in: winter pelage  grayish (near 17'''_k_ Olive Brown) rather than blackish (17''''_k_ or  17''''_m_ Chaetura Drab or Chaetura Black); summer pelage slightly  grayer; skull relatively slightly broader rostrally and  interorbitally.    _Remarks._--_S. v. monticola_ intergrades gradually with _S. v.  obscurus_ to the north and east; indeed the type locality is actually  in this area of intergradation. So far as I know, _monticola_ is not  in reproductive continuity with any other subspecies of _Sorex  vagrans_. Specimens from southeastern Arizona are the smallest and  seem to be the most \"typical\" in the sense that they are most  different from _S. v. obscurus_. Some specimens from the whole length  of the Rocky Mountain chain in the United States have for years been  referred to _monticola_. Some of these, as I have pointed out, belong  to _S. v. longiquus_, and others are intergrades between _S. v.  obscurus_ and _S. v. vagrans_. Since _vagrans_ and _monticola_  resemble one another somewhat, and since topotypes of _S. v.  monticola_ actually show the influence of intergradation with  _obscurus_, it is easy to understand how intergrades between  _obscurus_ and _vagrans_ could have been assigned to _monticola_.    Throughout most of its range, _S. v. monticola_ is the only _Sorex_  present. In some places _monticola_ may occur with _S. nanus_ or _S.  merriami_. _S. v. monticola_ occurs with the water shrew in  southeastern Arizona.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 80.

Mus.; obtained at  Shoalwater (Willapa) Bay, Pacific Co., Washington; received from J. G.  Cooper, and entered in Museum catalog on October 23, 1856.    _Range._--The Great Basin, and Columbia Plateau west across the  mountains to the Pacific coast of northern California, Oregon,  Washington and southwestern British Columbia.    _Diagnosis._--Size small for the species; average and extreme  measurements of 8 topotypes are: total length, 104.1 (99-109); tail,  43.3 (42-45); hind foot, 12.9 (12-14). Summer pelage ranging from  (15'_k_) Cinnamon Brown through (15'_m_) Proutt's Brown to (17'_m_)  Mummy Brown. Winter pelage (13''''_m_) Fuscous Black to (17''''_m_)  Chaetura Black.    _Comparisons._--For comparison with _S. v. monticola_ see account of  that subspecies. Differs from _S. v. halicoetes_ in relatively  narrower and more attenuate rostrum and in less brownish underparts in  winter pelage; smaller and more brownish (less grayish) than _Sorex  vagrans_ from the southern Sierra Nevada.

Several names are available for consideration. The name  _Sorex vagrans dobsoni_ Merriam, 1891, type locality Alturas Lake,  Blaine Co., Idaho, was once applied to small shrews from Idaho,  Montana, Wyoming, and Utah, but was considered by Jackson to be  synonymous with _S. v. monticola_. The name _Sorex vagrans amoenus_  Merriam, 1895, type locality near Mammoth, Mono Co., California, has  been applied to wandering shrews from western Nevada, northeastern  California and southern Oregon. _Sorex vagrans nevadensis_ Merriam,  1895, type locality Reese River on Nye-Lander Co. line, Nevada was  considered by Hall (1946:119) to be synonymous with _S. v. amoenus_.  Specimens of _Sorex vagrans_ west of the Cascade Mountains have long  been referred to the nominate subspecies which has its type locality  at Willapa Bay, Pacific Co., Washington. Over so wide an area it is  only to be expected that some geographic variation is to be found.  Thus specimens from central Nevada average slightly paler in summer  pelage than those from the Pacific Coast or from the foothills of the  Rocky Mountains. In addition there are slight average differences in  size from place to place. Topotypes of _S. v. vagrans_, however, show  a fair degree of variability and some are nearly as pale as the paler  Great Basin stocks. Furthermore topotypical individuals of _vagrans_  can be lost in series of _S. v. amoenus_, although _amoenus_ is  shorter-tailed on the average. Specimens from the western foothills"]]]
