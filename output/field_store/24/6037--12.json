These opinions differ widely, but have one attribute in  common--their emphatic \"cock-sureness.\" Each one presents the one and  only solution of the whole Arabian problem according to the facet which  the writer has seen, and there are many facets. They are amusing and  even instructive occasionally, but there is a serious side to  them--their crass empiricism. Each writer presents (quite honestly,  perhaps) his point of view of one or two facets in the rough-cut,  many-sided and clouded crystal of Arabian politics without considering  its possible bearing on other parts of the peninsula or even other  factors in the district he knows or has read about. The net result is an  appallingly crude patchwork, no one piece harmonising with another,  and, in view of the habit Government has formed in these cases of  accepting empirical opinions if they are shouted loud enough or at close  range, there is more than a possibility that our Arabian policy may  resemble such a crazy quilt. If it does, we shall have to harvest a  thistle-crop of tribal and intertribal trouble throughout the Arabian  peninsula, and the seed-down of unrest will blow all over Syria and  Mesopotamia just at the most awkward time when reconstruction and sound  administration are struggling to establish themselves. Weeds grow  quicker and stronger than useful plants in any garden.    Empirical statements sound well and look well in print, but they are no  use whatever as sailing directions in the uncharted waters of Arabian  politics. Putting them aside, the following facts are worth bearing in  mind when the future of Arabia is discussed.    The Hejazi troops were ably led by the Sharifian Emirs and Syrian  officers of note, and had the co-operation of the Red Sea flotilla on  the coast and British officers of various corps inland to cut off  Medina, the last place of importance held by the Turks after the summer  of 1916. Yet the town held out until long after the armistice, and its  surrender had eventually to be brought about by putting pressure on the  Turkish Government at Stamboul. On the other hand, the two great  provinces which impinge upon the Hejaz, namely, Nejd and Yamen, have  given ample proof that they can hammer the Turks without outside  assistance. The Nejdis not only cleared their own country of Ottoman  rule, but drove the Turks out of Hasa a year or two before the War,  while the Yamenis have more than once hurled the Turks back on to the  coast, and the rebels of northern Yamen successfully withstood a Hejazi  and Turkish column from the north and another Turkish column from the  south. The inference is that if the limits of Hejazi rule are to be much  extended there had better be a clear understanding with their neighbours  and also some definite idea of the extent to which we are likely to be  involved in support of our _protege_.    I know that many otherwise intelligent people have been hypnotised by  the prophecy in \"The White Prophet\":        \"The time is near when the long drama that has been played      between Arabs and Turks will end in the establishment of a vast      Arabic empire, extending from the Tigris and the Euphrates      valley to the Mediterranean and from the Indian Ocean to      Jerusalem, with Cairo as its Capital, the Khedive as its      Caliph, and England as its lord and protector.\"    While refraining from obvious and belated criticism of a prophecy which  the march of events has trodden out of shape, and which could never have  been intended as a serious contribution to our knowledge of Arabs and  their politics, we must admit that the basic idea of centralising  Arabian authority has taken strong hold of avowed statecraft in England.  It would, of course, simplify our relations with Arabia and the  collateral regions of Mesopotamia and Syria if such authority could  establish itself and be accepted by the other Arabian provinces to the  extent of enforcing its enactments as regards their foreign affairs,  _i.e._, relations with subjects (national or protected) of European  States.    If such authority could be maintained without assistance from us other  than a subsidy and the occasional supply, to responsible parties, of  arms and ammunition, it would satisfy all reasonable requirements, but  if we had to intervene with direct force we should find ourselves  defending an unpopular _protege_ against the united resentment of  Arabia.    I believe there is no one ruler or ruling clique in Arabia that could  wield such authority, and my reason for saying so is that the experiment  has been tried repeatedly on a small scale during the twenty years or so  that I have been connected with the country and has failed every time.  Toward the close of last century a sultan of Lahej who had always  claimed suzerainty over his turbulent neighbours, the Subaihi, had to  enter that vagabond tribeship to enforce one of his decrees, and got  held up with his \"army\" until extricated by Aden diplomacy at the price  of his suzerain sway. His successor still claimed a hold over an  adjacent clan of the Subaihi known as the Rigai, but when one of our  most promising political officers was murdered there, and the murderer  sheltered by the clan, he was unable to obtain redress or even assist us  adequately in attempting to do so. Early in this century Aden was  involved in a little expedition against Turks and Arabs because one of  her protected sultans (equipped with explosive and ammunition) could not  deal with a small Arab fort himself. This is the same sultanate which  let the Turks through against us in the summer of 1915 and whose ruler  was prominent in the sacking of Lahej. I have already alluded, in  Chapter II, to the inadequacy of the Lahej sultan on that occasion, yet  Aden had bolstered up his authority in every possible way and had relied  on him and his predecessor for years to act as semi-official suzerain  and go-between for other tribes--a withered stick which snapped the  first time it was leant upon. I could also point to the Imam of Yamen,  strong in opposition to the Turks as a rallying point of tribal revolt,  but weak and vacillating on the side of law and order. I might go on  giving instances _ad nauseam_, but here is one more to clinch the  argument, and it is typical of Arab politics. Aden had just cause of  offence against a certain reigning sultan of the Abd-ul-Wahid in her  eastern sphere of influence. He had intrigued with foreign States,  oppressed his subjects, persecuted native trade and played the dickens  generally. Therefore Aden rebuked him (by letter) and appointed a  relative of his to be sultan and receive his subsidy. The erring but  impenitent potentate reduced his relative to such submission that he  would sign monthly receipts for the subsidy and meekly hand over the  cash: these were his only official acts, as he retired into private life  in favour of Aden's _bete noir_, who flourished exceedingly until he  blackmailed caravans too freely and got the local tribesmen on his  track.    When we also consider how early in Islamic history the Caliphate split  as a temporal power, and the difficulty which even the early Caliphs  (with all their prestige) had to keep order in Arabia, it should  engender caution in experiments toward even partial centralisation of  control: apart from the fact that they might develop along lines  diverging from the recognised principles of self-determination in small  States, they could land us into a humiliating _impasse_ or an armed  expedition.    We parried the Turco-German efforts to turn pan-Islam against us, thanks  to our circumspect attitude with regard to Moslems, but a genuine  movement based on any apparent aggression of ours in Arabia proper might  be a more serious matter.        FOOTNOTES:        [Footnote B: \"_Arabia Infelix_,\" Macmillan.]          CHAPTER IV    MOSLEM AND MISSIONARY      Having weighed the influence which pan-Islam can wield as a popular  movement, we will now consider the human factors which have built it up.    Just as we used Christendom as a test-gauge of pan-Islam, so now we will  compare the activities of Moslems (who do their own proselytising) with  those of Christian missionaries, grouping with them our laity so far as  their example may be placed in the scales for or against the influence  of Christendom.    To do this with the breadth of view which the question demands we will  examine these human factors throughout the world wherever they are  involved in opposition to each other. We shall thus avoid the confined  outlook which teaches Europeans in Asia Minor to look on Turks as  typical Moslems to the exclusion of all others, or makes Anglo-Egyptians  talk of country-folk in Egypt as Arabs and their language as the  standard of Arabic, or engenders the Anglo-Indian tendency of regarding  a scantily-dressed paramount chief from the Aden hinterland as an  obscure _jungliwala_ because, in civilised India, an eminent Moslem  dresses in accordance with our conception of the part.    We can leave the western hemisphere out of this inquiry, for though the  greatest missionary effort against Islam is engendered in the United  States, it manifests itself in the eastern hemisphere, and the Moslem  population in both the Americas is too small and quiescent to be  considered a factor.    We will begin with England and work eastward to the edge of the Moslem  world.    At first glance the idea of England as an arena where two great  religious forces meet seems rather far-fetched, but there is more Moslem  activity in some of our English towns than people imagine. Turning over  some files of the _Kibla_ (a Meccan newspaper), one comes across  passages like the following:--        \"The honourable Cadi Abdulla living in London reports that six      noted English men and women have embraced the Moslem religion    "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/271"],[0,"Black Beauty (#13)"],[1,"think  of it, sir?\"    \"I don't know a man anywhere,\" said master, \"that I should think so  suitable for it as yourself. You understand horses, and somehow they  understand you, and in time you might set up for yourself; I think you  could not do better. If in any way I can help you, write to me. I shall  speak to my agent in London, and leave your character with him.\"    Master gave John the name and address, and then he thanked him for his  long and faithful service; but that was too much for John. \"Pray, don't,  sir, I can't bear it; you and my dear mistress have done so much for  me that I could never repay it. But we shall never forget you, sir, and  please God, we may some day see mistress back again like herself; we  must keep up hope, sir.\" Master gave John his hand, but he did not  speak, and they both left the stable.    The last sad day had come; the footman and the heavy luggage had gone  off the day before, and there were only master and mistress and her  maid. Ginger and I brought the carriage up to the hall door for the last  time. The servants brought out cushions and rugs and many other things;  and when all were arranged master came down the steps carrying the  mistress in his arms (I was on the side next to the house, and could see  all that went on); he placed her carefully in the carriage, while the  house servants stood round crying.    \"Good-by, again,\" he said; \"we shall not forget any of you,\" and he got  in. \"Drive on, John.\"    Joe jumped up, and we trotted slowly through the park and through the  village, where the people were standing at their doors to have a last  look and to say, \"God bless them.\"    When we reached the railway station I think mistress walked from the  carriage to the waiting-room. I heard her say in her own sweet voice,  \"Good-by, John. God bless you.\" I felt the rein twitch, but John made no  answer; perhaps he could not speak. As soon as Joe had taken the things  out of the carriage John called him to stand by the horses, while he  went on the platform. Poor Joe! he stood close up to our heads to hide  his tears. Very soon the train came puffing up into the station; then  two or three minutes, and the doors were slammed to, the guard whistled,  and the train glided away, leaving behind it only clouds of white smoke  and some very heavy hearts.    When it was quite out of sight John came back.    \"We shall never see her again,\" he said--\"never.\" He took the reins,  mounted the box, and with Joe drove slowly home; but it was not our home  now.          Part II          22 Earlshall      The next morning after breakfast Joe put Merrylegs into the mistress'  low chaise to take him to the vicarage; he came first and said good-by  to us, and Merrylegs neighed to us from the yard. Then John put the  saddle on Ginger and the leading rein on me, and rode us across the  country about fifteen miles to Earlshall Park, where the Earl of W----  lived. There was a very fine house and a great deal of stabling. We went  into the yard through a stone gateway, and John asked for Mr. York. It  was some time before he came. He was a fine-looking, middle-aged man,  and his voice said at once that he expected to be obeyed. He was very  friendly and polite to John, and after giving us a slight look he  called a groom to take us to our boxes, and invited John to take some  refreshment.    We were taken to a light, airy stable, and placed in boxes adjoining  each other, where we were rubbed down and fed. In about half an hour  John and Mr. York, who was to be our new coachman, came in to see us.    \"Now, Mr. Manly,\" he said, after carefully looking at us both, \"I can  see no fault in these horses; but we all know that horses have their  peculiarities as well as men, and that sometimes they need different  treatment. I should like to know if there is anything particular in  either of these that you would like to mention.\"    \"Well,\" said John, \"I don't believe there is a better pair of horses in  the country, and right grieved I am to part with them, but they are not  alike. The black one is the most perfect temper I ever knew; I suppose  he has never known a hard word or a blow since he was foaled, and all  his pleasure seems to be to do what you wish; but the chestnut, I fancy,  must have had bad treatment; we heard as much from the dealer. She came  to us snappish and suspicious, but when she found what sort of place  ours was, it all went off by degrees; for three years I have never seen  the smallest sign of temper, and if she is well treated there is not  a better, more willing animal than she is. But she is naturally a more  irritable constitution than the black horse; flies tease her more;  anything wrong in the harness frets her more; and if she were ill-used  or unfairly treated she would not be unlikely to give tit for tat. You  know that many high-mettled horses will do so.\"    \"Of course,\" said York, \"I quite understand; but you know it is not easy  in stables like these to have all the grooms just what they should be. I  do my best, and there I must leave it. I'll remember what you have said  about the mare.\"    They were going out of the stable, when John stopped and said, \"I had  better mention that we have never used the check-rein with either of  them; the black horse never had one on, and the dealer said it was the  gag-bit that spoiled the other's temper.\"    \"Well,\" said York, \"if they come here they must wear the check-rein. I  prefer a loose rein myself, and his lordship is always very reasonable  about horses; but my lady--that's another thing; she will have style,  and if her carriage horses are not reined up tight she wouldn't look at  them. I always stand out against the gag-bit, and shall do so, but it  must be tight up when my lady rides!\"    \"I am sorry for it, very sorry,\" said John; \"but I must go now, or I  shall lose the train.\"    He came round to each of us to pat and speak to us for the last time;  his voice sounded very sad.    I held my face close to him; that was all I could do to say good-by; and  then he was gone, and I have never seen him since.    The next day Lord W---- came to look at us; he seemed pleased with our  appearance.    \"I have great confidence in these horses,\" he said, \"from the character  my friend Mr. Gordon has given me of them. Of course they are not a  match in color, but my idea is that they will do very well for the  carriage while we are in the country. Before we go to London I must try  to match Baron; the black horse, I believe, is perfect for riding.\"    York then told him what John had said about us.    \"Well,\" said he, \"you must keep an eye to the mare, and put the  check-rein easy; I dare say they will do very well with a little  humoring at first. I'll mention it to your lady.\"    In the afternoon we were harnessed and put in the carriage, and as the  stable clock struck three we were led round to the front of the house.  It was all very grand, and three or four times as large as the old house  at Birtwick, but not half so pleasant, if a horse may have an opinion.  Two footmen were standing ready, dressed in drab livery, with scarlet  breeches and white stockings. Presently we heard the rustling sound of  silk as my lady came down the flight of stone steps. She stepped round  to look at us; she was a tall, proud-looking woman, and did not  seem pleased about something, but she said nothing, and got into the  carriage. This was the first time of wearing a check-rein, and I must  say, though it certainly was a nuisance not to be able to get my head  down now and then, it did not pull my head higher than I was accustomed  to carry it. I felt anxious about Ginger, but she seemed to be quiet and  content.    The next day at three o'clock we were again at the door, and the footmen  as before; we heard the silk dress rustle and the lady came down the  steps, and in an imperious voice she said, \"York, you must put those  horses' heads higher; they are not fit to be seen.\"    York got down, and said very respectfully, \"I beg your pardon, my lady,  but these horses have not been reined up for three years, and my lord  said it would be safer to bring them to it by degrees; but if your  ladyship pleases I can take them up a little more.\"    \"Do so,\" she said.    York came round to our heads and shortened the rein himself--one hole,  I think; every little makes a difference, be it for better or worse, and  that day we had a steep hill to go up. Then I began to understand what  I had heard of. Of course, I wanted to put my head forward and take the  carriage up with a will, as we had been used to do; but no, I had to  pull with my head up now, and that took all the spirit out of me, and  the strain came on my back and legs. When we came in Ginger said, \"Now  you see what it is like; but this is not bad, and if it does not get  much worse than this I shall say nothing about it, for we are very well  treated here; but if they strain me up tight, why, let 'em look out! I  can't bear it, and I won't.\"    Day by day, hole by hole, our bearing reins were shortened, and instead  of looking forward with pleasure to having my harness put on, as I used  to do, I began to dread it. Ginger, too, seemed restless, though she  said very little. At last I thought the worst was over; for several days  there was no more shortening, and I determined to make the best of  it and do my duty, though it was now a constant harass instead of a  pleasure; but the worst was not come.          23 A Strike for Liberty      One day my lady came down later than usual, and the silk rustled more  than ever.    \"Drive to the Duchess of B----'s,\" she said, and then after a pause,  \"Are you never going to get those horses' heads up, York? Raise them at  once and let us have no more of this humoring and nonsense.\"    York came to me first, while the groom stood at Ginger's head. He drew  my head back and fixed the rein so tight that it was almost intolerable;  "]]]
