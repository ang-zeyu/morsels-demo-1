We naturally believe, for  example, that tables and chairs, trees and mountains, are still there  when we turn our backs upon them. I do not wish for a moment to maintain  that this is certainly not the case, but I do maintain that the question  whether it is the case is not to be settled off-hand on any supposed  ground of obviousness. The belief that they persist is, in all men  except a few philosophers, logically primitive, but it is not  psychologically primitive; psychologically, it arises only through our  having seen those tables and chairs, trees and mountains. As soon as the  question is seriously raised whether, because we have seen them, we have  a right to suppose that they are there still, we feel that some kind of  argument must be produced, and that if none is forthcoming, our belief  can be no more than a pious opinion. We do not feel this as regards the  immediate objects of sense: there they are, and as far as their  momentary existence is concerned, no further argument is required. There  is accordingly more need of justifying our psychologically derivative  beliefs than of justifying those that are primitive.    We are thus led to a somewhat vague distinction between what we may call  \"hard\" data and \"soft\" data. This distinction is a matter of degree, and  must not be pressed; but if not taken too seriously it may help to make  the situation clear. I mean by \"hard\" data those which resist the  solvent influence of critical reflection, and by \"soft\" data those  which, under the operation of this process, become to our minds more or  less doubtful. The hardest of hard data are of two sorts: the particular  facts of sense, and the general truths of logic. The more we reflect  upon these, the more we realise exactly what they are, and exactly what  a doubt concerning them really means, the more luminously certain do  they become. _Verbal_ doubt concerning even these is possible, but  verbal doubt may occur when what is nominally being doubted is not  really in our thoughts, and only words are actually present to our  minds. Real doubt, in these two cases, would, I think, be pathological.  At any rate, to me they seem quite certain, and I shall assume that you  agree with me in this. Without this assumption, we are in danger of  falling into that universal scepticism which, as we saw, is as barren as  it is irrefutable. If we are to continue philosophising, we must make  our bow to the sceptical hypothesis, and, while admitting the elegant  terseness of its philosophy, proceed to the consideration of other  hypotheses which, though perhaps not certain, have at least as good a  right to our respect as the hypothesis of the sceptic.    Applying our distinction of \"hard\" and \"soft\" data to psychologically  derivative but logically primitive beliefs, we shall find that most, if  not all, are to be classed as soft data. They may be found, on  reflection, to be capable of logical proof, and they then again become  believed, but no longer as data. As data, though entitled to a certain  limited respect, they cannot be placed on a level with the facts of  sense or the laws of logic. The kind of respect which they deserve seems  to me such as to warrant us in hoping, though not too confidently, that  the hard data may prove them to be at least probable. Also, if the hard  data are found to throw no light whatever upon their truth or falsehood,  we are justified, I think, in giving rather more weight to the  hypothesis of their truth than to the hypothesis of their falsehood. For  the present, however, let us confine ourselves to the hard data, with a  view to discovering what sort of world can be constructed by their means  alone.    Our data now are primarily the facts of sense (_i.e._ of _our own_  sense-data) and the laws of logic. But even the severest scrutiny will  allow some additions to this slender stock. Some facts of  memory--especially of recent memory--seem to have the highest degree of  certainty. Some introspective facts are as certain as any facts of  sense. And facts of sense themselves must, for our present purposes, be  interpreted with a certain latitude. Spatial and temporal relations must  sometimes be included, for example in the case of a swift motion falling  wholly within the specious present. And some facts of comparison, such  as the likeness or unlikeness of two shades of colour, are certainly to  be included among hard data. Also we must remember that the distinction  of hard and soft data is psychological and subjective, so that, if there  are other minds than our own--which at our present stage must be held  doubtful--the catalogue of hard data may be different for them from what  it is for us.    Certain common beliefs are undoubtedly excluded from hard data. Such is  the belief which led us to introduce the distinction, namely, that  sensible objects in general persist when we are not perceiving them.  Such also is the belief in other people's minds: this belief is  obviously derivative from our perception of their bodies, and is felt to  demand logical justification as soon as we become aware of its  derivativeness. Belief in what is reported by the testimony of others,  including all that we learn from books, is of course involved in the  doubt as to whether other people have minds at all. Thus the world from  which our reconstruction is to begin is very fragmentary. The best we  can say for it is that it is slightly more extensive than the world at  which Descartes arrived by a similar process, since that world contained  nothing except himself and his thoughts.    We are now in a position to understand and state the problem of our  knowledge of the external world, and to remove various misunderstandings  which have obscured the meaning of the problem. The problem really is:  Can the existence of anything other than our own hard data be inferred  from the existence of those data? But before considering this problem,  let us briefly consider what the problem is _not_.    When we speak of the \"external\" world in this discussion, we must not  mean \"spatially external,\" unless \"space\" is interpreted in a peculiar  and recondite manner. The immediate objects of sight, the coloured  surfaces which make up the visible world, are spatially external in the  natural meaning of this phrase. We feel them to be \"there\" as opposed to  \"here\"; without making any assumption of an existence other than hard  data, we can more or less estimate the distance of a coloured surface.  It seems probable that distances, provided they are not too great, are  actually given more or less roughly in sight; but whether this is the  case or not, ordinary distances can certainly be estimated approximately  by means of the data of sense alone. The immediately given world is  spatial, and is further not wholly contained within our own bodies. Thus  our knowledge of what is external in this sense is not open to doubt.    Another form in which the question is often put is: \"Can we know of the  existence of any reality which is independent of ourselves?\" This form  of the question suffers from the ambiguity of the two words  \"independent\" and \"self.\" To take the Self first: the question as to  what is to be reckoned part of the Self and what is not, is a very  difficult one. Among many other things which we may mean by the Self,  two may be selected as specially important, namely, (1) the bare subject  which thinks and is aware of objects, (2) the whole assemblage of things  that would necessarily cease to exist if our lives came to an end. The  bare subject, if it exists at all, is an inference, and is not part of  the data; therefore this meaning of Self may be ignored in our present  inquiry. The second meaning is difficult to make precise, since we  hardly know what things depend upon our lives for their existence. And  in this form, the definition of Self introduces the word \"depend,\" which  raises the same questions as are raised by the word \"independent.\" Let  us therefore take up the word \"independent,\" and return to the Self  later.    When we say that one thing is \"independent\" of another, we may mean  either that it is logically possible for the one to exist without the  other, or that there is no causal relation between the two such that the  one only occurs as the effect of the other. The only way, so far as I  know, in which one thing can be _logically_ dependent upon another is  when the other is _part_ of the one. The existence of a book, for  example, is logically dependent upon that of its pages: without the  pages there would be no book. Thus in this sense the question, \"Can we  know of the existence of any reality which is independent of ourselves?\"  reduces to the question, \"Can we know of the existence of any reality of  which our Self is not part?\" In this form, the question brings us back  to the problem of defining the Self; but I think, however the Self may  be defined, even when it is taken as the bare subject, it cannot be  supposed to be part of the immediate object of sense; thus in this form  of the question we must admit that we can know of the existence of  realities independent of ourselves.    The question of causal dependence is much more difficult. To know that  one kind of thing is causally independent of another, we must know that  it actually occurs without the other. Now it is fairly obvious that,  whatever legitimate meaning we give to the Self, our thoughts and  feelings are causally dependent upon ourselves, _i.e._ do not occur when  there is no Self for them to belong to. But in the case of objects of  sense this is not obvious; indeed, as we saw, the common-sense view is  that such objects persist in the absence of any percipient. If this is  the case, then they are causally independent of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37122"],[0,"Hunting in Many Lands: The Book of the Boone and Crockett Club (#13)"],[1,"varied quantity of sport.    My first trip was in March, after tigers. On the 1st of March I started  from Hyderabad with Colonels Fraser and Watson, and traveled by  palanquin that day and night, and most of the next day, striking the  foot of the G[=a]t at a place called Rungapore, and then going on over a  great plain, beyond which we camped. The scenery was magnificent, and  we heard much news of the devastation of tigers among the large herds of  miserable-looking cattle belonging to the poor villagers roundabout. The  thermometer went up to 96 degrees in the shade during the day, but the  nights were lovely and cool. Thanks to Colonel Fraser, we were fitted  out as comfortably as we could be, and the luxury of the camp life  offered the strongest possible contrast to my experiences in roughing it  on the buffalo range in northwestern Texas.    For the first two days we accomplished nothing, though several of the  cattle we had put out for baits were killed, and though we started and  beat the jungles with our elephants whenever we received khubber, or  news. Our camp equipage included twenty elephants, forty camels and  bullocks, thirty horses for the troopers, and fifty baggage horses. We  had seventeen private servants, twenty-six police, fifty-two bearers,  and an indefinite number of attendants for the elephants and camels, and  of camp followers. An Indian of high position, Sir Salar Jung, was along  also; so our total retinue comprised 350 men, in addition to which we  employed each day of beaters 150 or 200 more.    On March 5th, one of the shikaris brought word that he had seen and  heard a tigress and two cubs at a nullah about six miles away.  Immediately we started up the valley, Col. Fraser, Col. Watson and  myself, each on his own elephant. The jungle was on fire and the first  beat was not successful, for we had to fight the fire, and in the  excitement the brute got off. However, some of the watchers saw her, and  marked her down in another small ravine. Through this we again beat, the  excitement being at fever heat. I was, of course, new to the work, and  the strangeness of the scene, the cries of the beaters and watchers, the  occasional explosion of native fireworks, together with the quantity of  other game that we saw, impressed me much. In this ravine I was favored  by good luck. The tigress broke right in front of me, and I hit her with  a ball from a No. 12 smooth-bore. She sickened at once and crawled back  into the jungle. In we went on the elephants, tracking her up. She made  no attempt to charge, and I finished her off with another barrel of the  smooth-bore and two express bullets. The crowd of natives ran up,  abusing the tigress and praising me, while the two colonels drank my  health. We then padded the tigress and rode back to camp, having been  gone from half past 9 in the morning till 7 in the evening. This tigress  weighed, when we brought her in, 280 pounds; her living weight must have  been much more.    Next day we again got news of a tigress, with one cub, but we failed to  find her. The following day, for a change, I tried still-hunting through  the woods. There was not much game, but what we did see was far from  shy, and the shooting was easy. The camp was on a terrace, and from it  we went up a range of hills to the stalking ground. It was a stony  country and the trees were scrubby. I shot two cheetul, or spotted deer,  and also two of the little jungle cocks. The next day again was a blank,  but on the 9th we got another tiger. Thanks to the courtesy of my  friends, I was given the first shot, again hitting it with one barrel of  the smooth-bore. The heat was very great on this day. It was not  possible to touch the gun barrels without a glove, and the thirst was  awful. In the evening the cool bath was a luxury indeed. By moonlight  the camp was very fine. The next morning I was off at daybreak, snipe  shooting around a big tank, seven miles away. On my return I found that  my companions had gone out for a beat, and so, after a hurried  breakfast, I jumped on my horse and rode after them. That afternoon we  beat two ravines and got a tiger. This was the last tiger that we  killed. The weather was getting very warm, and, though we stayed a week  longer out, we failed to get on terms with Mr. Stripes again. However, I  shot three sambur stags. Two of them were weighed in camp, their weight  being, respectively, 450 and 438 pounds.    It was now getting hot, and I determined to start northward for my  summer's hunting in the Himalayas and Cashmere, although it was rather  early to try to get through the mountains. I left Lahore on April 6th  for the Pir Pinjal. My transportation consisted of eight pack ponies and  three native single-horse carts. I was shown every courtesy by Mr.  McKay, a member of the Forest Department, at Gujarat. I intended to make  a hunt for gorals and bears in the mountains around the Pir Pinjal  before striking through to Cashmere. The goral is a little mountain  antelope, much like the chamois, only with straight horns. The bear in  the region in which I was hunting was the black bear, which is very  much like our own black bear. Further on in the Himalayas is found the  red or snow bear, which is a good deal like the great brown bear of  Europe, or a small and inoffensive grizzly. After leaving Gujarat, I  traveled for several days before coming to my hunting ground proper,  although on the way I killed some peacocks, partridges, and finally some  very handsome pheasants of different kinds. The country offered the  greatest possible contrast to that in which I had been hunting tigers.  Everything was green and lovely, and the scenery was magnificent beyond  description--the huge steep mountains rising ahead of me, while the  streams were crystal-clear, noisy torrents. The roads were very rough,  and the wild flowers formed great carpets everywhere.    On the 16th of April I began my shooting, having by this time left my  heavy baggage behind, and having with me only what the coolies could  carry. I had two shikaris, four servants and twelve coolies, besides  myself. On April 16th I killed my first goral. I had hunted in vain all  day, but about 5 o'clock one of the shikaris advised my starting out  again and climbing around the neighboring cliffs. I did this for two  and one-half hours, and then got a close shot and killed the little  beast. This was my first trial of grass-shoes, and my first experience  in climbing over the stupendous mountain masses; for stupendous they  were, though they were only the foothills of the Himalayas proper.  Without grass-shoes it is impossible to climb on these smooth, grassy  slopes; but I found that they hurt my feet a great deal. The next day I  again went off with my two shikaris over the mountains. Each of them  carried a gun. I had all I could do to take care of myself without one,  for a mis-step would have meant a fall of a thousand or two feet. In the  morning we saw five gorals and I got one. At 10 I stopped and a coolie  came up with a lunch, and I lay reading, sleeping and idly watching the  grand mountains until the afternoon, when we began again to examine the  nullahs for game, being all the time much amused by the monkeys. At 4 we  started again, and in a jagged mass of precipices I got another goral.  The next day I repeated my experience, and had one of the characteristic  bits of bad luck, offset by good luck, that come to every  hunter--missing a beautiful shot at fifty yards, and then, by a fluke,  killing a goral at 300 yards. The animal, however, fell over 1,000 feet  and was ruined. I myself had a slip this day and went down about fifty  feet. The following day I again went off to climb, and the first ascent  was so steep that at the top I was completely blown, and missed a  beautiful shot at a goral at fifty yards. I then arranged a beat, but  nothing came from it, and the morning was a blank. In the afternoon I  gave up beating and tried still-hunting again. It was hard work, but I  was very successful, and killed two gorals and a bear.    At this time I was passed by two English officers, also going in to  shoot--one of them, Captain S. D. Turnbull, a very jolly fellow and a  good sportsman, with whom I got on excellent terms; the other, a Captain  C., was a very bad walker and a poor shot, and was also a disagreeable  companion, as he would persist in trying to hang around my hunting  grounds, thus forcing me continually to shift.    On April 21st I tried driving for gorals, and got four, and on the next  two days I got three gorals and two bears. So far I had had great luck  and great sport. The work was putting me in fine trim, except my feet,  which were getting very sore. It was very hard work going after the  gorals. The bears offered easier stalking, and, like our American black  bear but unlike our grizzly, they didn't show fight. The climbing was  awful work. The stones and grass-shoes combined bruised and skinned the  soles of my feet, so that I could not get relief without putting them in  clarified butter and then keeping them up in the air. Accordingly I  tried resting for a day, and meant to rest the following day too; but  could not forbear taking a four hours' stroll along the banks of the  brawling, snow-fed river, and was rewarded by shooting a surow--a queer,  squatty, black antelope, about the size of a Rocky Mountain white goat  and with similar horns. The next day I rested again, hoping my feet  would get better. Instead they got worse, and I made up my mind that, as  they were so bad, I might as well get some hunting anyhow, so off I  tramped on the 27th for another all-day jog. It would be difficult to  describe the pain that my feet gave me all day long. However, it was a  real sporting day. I suffered the tortures of the damned, but I got two  gorals and one tahr--a big species of goat with rather small horns--and  then hobbled back to"]]]
