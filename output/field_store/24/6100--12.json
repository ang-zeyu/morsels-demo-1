With a loud bleat of pain the  calf shot to his feet and went galloping around the yard. Mrs. Jabe  rushed to the door, and stared at him wide-eyed. In a moment her  senses came back to her, and she realized what a hideous thing she had  done. Next she remembered Jabe--and what he would think of it!    Then, indeed, her conscience awoke in earnest, and a wholesome dread  enlivened her remorse. Forgetting altogether the state of her kitchen,  she rushed through the slop to the flour-barrel. Flour, she had always  heard, was the thing for burns and scalds. The pesky calf should be  treated right, if it took the whole barrel. Scooping up an extravagant  dishpanful of the white, powdery stuff, and recklessly spilling a lot  of it to add to the mixture on the floor, she rushed out into the yard  to apply her treatment, and, if possible, poultice her conscience.    The young moose, anguished and bewildered, had at last taken refuge in  the darkest corner of the stable. As Mrs. Jabe approached with her pan  of flour, he stood staring and shaking, but made no effort to avoid  her, which touched the over-impetuous dame to a fresh pang of  penitence. She did not know that the stupid youngster had quite failed  to associate her in any way with his suffering. It was only the  pot--the big, black thing which had so inexplicably come bounding at  him--that he blamed. From Mrs. Jabe's hands he expected some kind of  consolation.    In the gloom of the stall Mrs. Jabe could not see the extent of the  calf's injury. \"Mebbe the water wasn't _quite_ bilin'!\" she murmured  hopefully, coaxing and dragging the youngster forth into the light.  The hope, however, proved vain as brief. In a long streak down behind  the shoulder the hair was already slipping off.    \"Sarved ye right!\" she grumbled remorsefully, as with gentle fingers  she began sifting the flour up and down over the wound. The light  stuff seemed to soothe the anguish for the moment, and the sufferer  stood quite still till the scald was thoroughly covered with a  tenacious white cake. Then a fresh and fiercer pang seized the wound.  With a bleat he tore himself away, and rushed off, tail in air, across  the stump-pasture and into the woods.    \"Mebbe he won't come back, and then Jabe won't never need to know!\"  soliloquized Mrs. Jabe, returning to clean up her kitchen.    The sufferer returned, however, early in the afternoon, and was in his  customary attitude before the door when Jabe, a little later, came  back also. The long white slash down his favourite's side caught the  woodsman's eye at once. He looked at it critically, touched the flour  with tentative finger-tips, then turned on his wife a look of poignant  interrogation. But Mrs. Jabe was ready for him. Her nerve had  recovered. The fact that her victim showed no fear of her had  gradually reassured her. What Jabe didn't know would never hurt him,  she mused.    \"Yes, yer pesky brat come stumblin' into the kitchen when the bar was  down, a-lookin' for ye. An' he upset the bilin' water I was goin' to  scrub with, an' broke the pot. An' I've got to have a new pot right  off, Jabe Smith--mind that!\"    \"Scalded himself pretty bad!\" remarked Jabe. \"Poor little beggar!\"    \"I done the best _I_ know'd how fer him!\" said his wife with an  injured air. \"Wasted most a quart o' good flour on his worthless hide!  Wish't he'd broke his neck 'stead of the only pot I got that's big  enough to bile the pig's feed in!\"    \"Well, you done jest about right, I reckon, Mandy,\" replied Jabe,  ashamed of his suspicions. \"I'll go in to the Cross Roads an' git ye a  new pot to-morrer, an' some tar for the scald. The tar'll be better'n  flour, an' keep the flies off.\"    \"I s'pose some men _ain't_ got nothin' better to do than be doctorin'  up a fool moose calf!\" assented Mrs. Jabe promptly, with a snort of  censorious resignation.    Whether because the flour and the tar had virtues, or because the  clean flesh of the wild kindreds makes all haste to purge itself of  ills, it was not long before the scald was perfectly healed. But the  reminder of it remained ineffaceable--a long, white slash down across  the brown hide of the young bull, from the tip of the left fore  shoulder.    Throughout the winter the young moose contentedly occupied the  cow-stable, with the two cows and the yoke of red oxen. He throve on  the fare Jabe provided for him--good meadow hay with armfuls of  \"browse\" cut from the birch, poplar and cherry thickets. Jabe trained  him to haul a pung, finding him slower to learn than a horse, but  making up for his dulness by his docility. He had to be driven with a  snaffle, refusing absolutely to admit a bit between his teeth; and,  with the best good-will in the world, he could never be taught to  allow for the pung or sled to which he was harnessed. If left alone  for a moment he would walk over fences with it, or through the most  tangled thickets, if thereby seemed the most direct way to reach Jabe;  and once, when Jabe, vaingloriously and at great speed, drove him in  to the Cross Roads, he smashed the vehicle to kindling-wood in the  amiable determination to follow his master into the Cross Roads store.  On this occasion also he made himself respected, but unpopular, by  killing, with one lightning stroke of a great fore hoof, a huge  mongrel mastiff belonging to the storekeeper. The mastiff had sprung  out at him wantonly, resenting his peculiar appearance. But the  storekeeper had been so aggrieved that Jabe had felt constrained to  mollify him with a five-dollar bill. He decided, therefore, that his  favourite's value was as a luxury, rather than a utility; and the  young bull was put no more to the practices of a horse. Jabe had  driven a bull moose in harness, and all the settlement could swear to  it. The glory was all his.    By early summer the young bull was a tremendous, long-legged,  high-shouldered beast, so big, so awkward, so friendly, and so sure  of everybody's good-will that everybody but Jabe was terribly afraid  of him. He had no conception of the purposes of a fence; and he could  not be taught that a garden was not meant for him to lie down in. As  the summer advanced, and the young bull's stature with it, Jabe Smith  began to realize that his favourite was an expensive and sometimes  embarrassing luxury. Nevertheless, when September brought budding  spikes of horns and a strange new restlessness to the stalwart  youngster, and the first full moon of October lured him one night away  from the farm on a quest which he could but blindly follow, Jabe was  inconsolable.    \"He ain't no more'n a calf yet, big as he is!\" fretted Jabe. \"He'll be  gittin' himself shot, the fool. Or mebbe some old bull'll be after  givin' him a lickin' fer interferin', and he'll come home to us!\"    To which his wife retorted with calm superiority: \"Ye're a bigger  fool'n even I took ye fer, Jabe Smith.\"    But the young bull did not come back that winter, nor the following  summer, nor the next year, nor the next. Neither did any Indian or  hunter or lumberman have anything to report as to a bull moose of  great stature, with a long white slash down his side. Either his quest  had carried him far to other and alien ranges, or some fatal mischance  of the wild had overtaken his inexperience. The latter was Jabe's  belief, and he concluded that his ungainly favourite had too soon  taken the long trail for the Red Men's land of ghosts.    Though Jabe Smith was primarily a lumberman and backwoods farmer, he  was also a hunter's guide, so expert that his services in this  direction were not to be obtained without very special inducement. At  \"calling\" moose he was acknowledged to have no rival. When he laid his  grimly-humourous lips to the long tube of birch-bark, which is the  \"caller's\" instrument of illusion, there would come from it a strange  sound, great and grotesque, harsh yet appealing, rude yet subtle, and  mysterious as if the uncomprehended wilderness had itself found voice.  Old hunters, wise in all woodcraft, had been deceived by the  sound--and much more easily the impetuous bull, waiting, high-antlered  and eager, for the love-call of his mate to summon him down the shore  of the still and moon-tranced lake.    When a certain Famous Hunter, whose heart took pride in horns and  heads and hides--the trophies won by his unerring rifle in all four  corners of earth--found his way at last to the tumbled wilderness that  lies about the headwaters of the Quah Davic, it was naturally one of  the great New Brunswick moose that he was after. Nothing but the  noblest antlers that New Brunswick forests bred could seem to him  worthy of a place on those walls of his, whence the surly front of a  musk-ox of the Barren Grounds glared stolid defiance to the snarl of  an Orinoco jaguar, and the black, colossal head of a Kadiak bear was  eyed derisively by the monstrous and malignant mask of a two-horned  rhinoceros. With such a quest upon him, the Famous Hunter came, and  naturally sought the guidance of Jabe Smith, whom he lured from the  tamer distractions of a \"timber cruise\" by double pay and the pledge  of an extravagant bonus if the quest should be successful.    The lake, lying low between its wooded hills, was like a glimmering  mirror in the misty October twilight when Jabe and the Famous Hunter  crept stealthily down to it. In a dense covert beside the water's edge  they hid themselves. Beside them stretched the open ribbon of a narrow  water-meadow, through which a slim brook, tinkling faintly over its  pebbles, slipped out into the stillness. Just beyond the mouth of the  brook a low, bare spit of sand jutted forth darkly upon the pale  surface of the lake.    [Illustration: \"IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MOON APPEARED ...

They also fly well and dive from their perch into the  water with the greatest celerity.    They nest in colonies in the swamps, placing their nests of sticks,  leaves and moss in the bushes over the water. They breed in April,  laying from three to five bluish eggs, covered with a chalky deposit.  Size 2.25 x 1.35. Data.--Gainesville, Florida, May 18, 1894. Nest in the  top of a button-wood tree, made of leaves and branches, overhanging the  water. Collector, George Graham.    [Illustration 079: Chalky bluish white.]  [Illustration: PELICAN POND. Washington Zoological Park.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 78    CORMORANTS. Family PHALACROCORACIDAE    Cormorants have a more bulky body than do the Anhingas; their tail is  shorter and the bill strongly hooked at the tip. Cormorants are found in  nearly all quarters of the globe. They are very gregarious and most  species are maritime. They feed upon fish which they catch by pursuing  under water. Most of the Cormorants have green eyes.    [Illustration: 080 left hand margin.]    Page 79    119. CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax carbo._    Range.--The Atlantic coast breeding from Maine to Greenland.    The common Cormorant or Shag is one of the largest of the race, having a  length of 36 inches.    In breeding plumage, the black head and neck are so thickly covered with  the slender white plumes as to almost wholly obscure the black. There is  also a large white patch on the flanks. They nest in colonies on the  rocky shores of Newfoundland and Labrador, placing their nests of sticks  and seaweed in rows along the high ledges, where they sit, as one writer  aptly expresses it, like so many black bottles. A few pairs also nest on  some of the isolated rocky islets off the Maine coast. During the latter  part of May and during June they lay generally four or five greenish  white, chalky looking eggs. Size 2.50 x 1.40. Data.--Black Horse Rock,  Maine coast, June 6, 1893. Four eggs in a nest of seaweed and a few  sticks; on a high ledge of rock. Collector, C. A. Reed.      120. DOUBLE-CRESTED CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax auritus auritus._    Range.--The Atlantic coast and also in the interior, breeding from Nova  Scotia and North Dakota northward.    This is a slightly smaller bird than carbo, and in the nesting season  the white plumes of the latter are replaced by tufts of black and white  feathers from above each eye. On the coast they nest the same as carbo  and in company with them on rocky islands. In the interior they place  their nests on the ground or occasionally in low trees on islands in the  lakes. They breed in large colonies, making the nests of sticks and  weeds and lay three or four eggs like those of the common Cormorant but  averaging shorter. Size 2.30 x 1.40. Data.--Stump Lake, North Dakota,  May 31, 1897. Nest of dead weeds on an island. Six eggs. Collector, T.  F. Eastgate.

NESTS OF DOUBLE-CRESTED CORMORANTS.]    Page 81    120a. FLORIDA CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax auritus floridanus._    This sub-species is a common breeding bird in the swamps and islands of  the Gulf coast and north to South Carolina and southern Illinois. The  nests are placed in the mangroves in some of the most impenetrable  swamps and are composed of twigs and lined with leaves or moss. They lay  three or four chalky bluish white eggs. Size 2.30 x 1.40. Data.--Bird  Is., Lake Kissimee, Florida, April 5, 1898. Three eggs. Nest made of  weeds and grass, in a willow bush.      120b. WHITE-CRESTED CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax auritus cincinatus._    Range.--Northwestern coast of North America, breeding in Alaska, and  south to the northern boundary of the United States, breeding both in  the interior and on the coast, in the former case generally on the  ground or in low trees on swampy islands and in the latter, on the rocky  cliffs of the coasts and islands. The nests are built in the same  fashion as the other Cormorants, and the three to five eggs are similar.  Size 2.45 x 1.40.      120c. FARALLON CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax auritus albociliatus._    Range.--This sub-species breeds on the coasts and islands of California  and southward.    In company with other species of Cormorants, these birds breed in large  numbers on the Farallones, placing their nests well up on the higher  ridges and rocks. They breed most abundantly during May. When nesting on  the inland islands, they place their nests in low bushes. Their nests  and eggs are similar to those of the other Cormorants. Size 2.40 x 1.50.  Data.--Farallones, California. Nest of weeds and seaweed on the rocks.  Collector, W. O. Emerson.    121. MEXICAN CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax vigua mexicanus._      Range.--Breeds abundantly from southern Texas, south through Mexico;  north rarely to Kansas; has recently been found breeding in limited  number on some of the Bahamas. In the interior they nest in trees,  chiefly those overhanging or growing in the water. On the coasts they  nest on the rocky ledges, as do the other Cormorants. They nest in  colonies building their abode of twigs and weeds, and during May laying  three or four eggs, greenish white in color and chalky, as are all the  Cormorants. Size 2.25 x 1.35.    [Illustration: right hand margin.]  [Illustration 083: Greenish white.]    Page 82    122. BRANDT'S CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax penicillatus._    Range.--Pacific coast breeding along the whole coast of the United  States.    This species is found more abundantly on the Farallones than is the  Farallone Cormorant. Like the other Cormorants breeding on these  islands, these cling closely to their nests, for fear of being robbed by  the Gulls, that are ever on the watch to steal either eggs or young.  Their nesting habits and eggs are identical with those of the other  species. Size 2.50 x 1.50. Data.--Bird Island, California, May 24, 1885.  A very bulky nest of seaweed on the rocks. Collector, A. M. Ingersoll.      123. PELAGIC CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax pelagicus pelagicus._    Range.--Coast of Alaska.    These are perhaps the most beautiful species of Cormorants, having  brilliant violet green metallic reflections and, in the breeding  plumage, crests on the forehead and nape, as well as large white flank  patches. They breed in large colonies on the Aleutian Islands, placing  their nests of sticks and sea mosses on the rocky ledges, often hundreds  of feet above the sea level. Three or four eggs are laid during May and  June. The young birds when hatched are naked and black, and are  repulsive looking objects, as are those of all the other Cormorants. The  eggs are greenish white with the usual calcareous deposit. Size 2.30 x  1.40.      123a. VIOLET-GREEN CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax pelagicus robustus._    This sub-species is found on the Pacific coast from Washington to the  Aleutian Islands. Their habits and nests and eggs are the same as those  of the Pelagic Cormorant, nesting on the high cliffs of the rocky  islands. The eggs are the same size as those of the preceding.      123b. BAIRD'S CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax pelagicus resplendens._    This variety breeds on the Pacific coast from Washington south to  Mexico. They nest on the Farallones, but in smaller numbers than the  other varieties found there. Both the birds and their eggs are smaller  than the preceding. Size of eggs 2.20 x 1.40.      124. RED-FACED CORMORANT. _Phalacrocorax urile._    Range.--Southwest coast of Alaska, migrating to Japan in the winter.    This species differs from the Pelagic chiefly in having the forehead  bare. They do not differ in their breeding habits from others of the  family. That the Cormorants are expert fishermen may be seen from the  fact that the Chinese tame and have them catch fish for them, placing a  ring around their neck to prevent their swallowing the fish. Their  nesting places are very filthy, being covered with excrement and remains  of fish that are strewn around the nests. They breed in June laying  three or four eggs. Size 2.50 x 1.50.    [Illustration 084: 120c--122.]  [Illustration: 123b--124.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 83    PELICANS. Family PELECANIDAE    Pelicans are large, short legged, web footed (all four toes joined by a  web) birds, the most noticeable feature of which is the long bill with  its enormous pouch suspended from lower mandible. This pouch, while  normally contracted, is capable of being distended to hold several  quarts. It is used as a scoop in which to catch small fish. Their skin  is filled with numerous air cells, making them very light and buoyant.      125. AMERICAN WHITE PELICAN. _Pelecanus erythrorhynchos._    Range.--Temperate North America, breeding in the interior, from Utah and  the Dakotas northward. These large birds, reaching a length of five  feet, are entirely white except for the black primaries. They get their  food by approaching a school of small fish and, suddenly dipping their  head beneath the surface, sometimes scoop up a large number of fish at a  time; after allowing the water to run out of the sides of the mouth,  they proceed to swallow their catch. They nest in large communities on  islands in some of the inland lakes.    Great Salt Lake, Utah, and Shoal Lake, Manitoba, furnish breeding ground  for many thousands of Pelicans. They build their simple nests on the  ground, making them of sticks and weeds. They generally lay two eggs,  but often three or four. Size 3.45 x 2.30. Data.--Egg Island, Great Salt  Lake, June 19, 1884. Two eggs. Nest a slight hollow in the ground,  surrounded by a few sticks. Collector, F. F. Leonard.
