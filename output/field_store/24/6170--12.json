CHAPTER III - MARRIAGE            What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put          asunder. In the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given          in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. - JESUS.    56:1    WHEN our great Teacher came to him for baptism,          John was astounded. Reading his thoughts, Jesus  56:3    added: \"Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us          to fulfil all righteousness.\" Jesus' concessions (in certain          cases) to material methods were for the advancement of  56:6    spiritual good.                                Marriage temporal            Marriage is the legal and moral provision for genera-          tion among human kind. Until the spiritual creation  56:9    is discerned intact, is apprehended and under-          stood, and His kingdom is come as in the vision          of the Apocalypse, - where the corporeal sense of crea-  56:12   tion was cast out, and its spiritual sense was revealed from          heaven, - marriage will continue, subject to such moral          regulations as will secure increasing virtue.                                Fidelity required    56:15   Infidelity to the marriage covenant is the social scourge          of all races, \"the pestilence that walketh in darkness,          . . . the destruction that wasteth at noonday.\"  56:18   The commandment, \"Thou shalt not com-          mit adultery,\" is no less imperative than the one, \"Thou          shalt not kill.\"    57:1    Chastity is the cement of civilization and progress.          Without it there is no stability in society, and without it  57:3    one cannot attain the Science of Life.                                 Mental elements            Union of the masculine and feminine qualities consti-          tutes completeness. The masculine mind reaches a  57:6    higher tone through certain elements of the          feminine, while the feminine mind gains cour-          age and strength through masculine qualities. These  57:9    different elements conjoin naturally with each other, and          their true harmony is in spiritual oneness. Both sexes          should be loving, pure, tender, and strong. The attrac-  57:12   tion between native qualities will be perpetual only as it          is pure and true, bringing sweet seasons of renewal like          the returning spring.                               Affection's demands    57:15   Beauty, wealth, or fame is incompetent to meet the          demands of the affections, and should never weigh          against the better claims of intellect, good-  57:18   ness, and virtue. Happiness is spiritual,          born of Truth and Love. It is unselfish; therefore          it cannot exist alone, but requires all mankind to  57:21   share it.                               Help and discipline            Human affection is not poured forth vainly, even          though it meet no return. Love enriches the nature, en-  57:24   larging, purifying, and elevating it. The wintry          blasts of earth may uproot the flowers of affec-          tion, and scatter them to the winds; but this severance  57:27   of fleshly ties serves to unite thought more closely to          God, for Love supports the struggling heart until it ceases          to sigh over the world and begins to unfold its wings for  57:30   heaven.            Marriage is unblest or blest, according to the disap-          pointments it involves or the hopes it fulfils. To happify  58:1    existence by constant intercourse with those adapted to          elevate it, should be the motive of society. Unity of  58:3    spirit gives new pinions to joy, or else joy's drooping          wings trail in dust.                                Chord and discord            Ill-arranged notes produce discord. Tones of the  58:6    human mind may be different, but they should be con-          cordant in order to blend properly. Unselfish          ambition, noble life-motives, and purity, -  58:9    these constituents of thought, mingling, constitute in-          dividually and collectively true happiness, strength, and          permanence.                                 Mutual freedom    58:12   There is moral freedom in Soul. Never contract the          horizon of a worthy outlook by the selfish exaction of          all another's time and thoughts. With ad-  58:15   ditional joys, benevolence should grow more          diffusive. The narrowness and jealousy, which would          confine a wife or a husband forever within four walls, will  58:18   not promote the sweet interchange of confidence and love;          but on the other hand, a wandering desire for incessant          amusement outside the home circle is a poor augury for  58:21   the happiness of wedlock. Home is the dearest spot on          earth, and it should be the centre, though not the bound-          ary, of the affections.                               A useful suggestion    58:24   Said the peasant bride to her lover: \"Two eat no more          together than they eat separately.\" This is a hint that          a wife ought not to court vulgar extravagance  58:27   or stupid ease, because another supplies her          wants. Wealth may obviate the necessity for toil or the          chance for ill-nature in the marriage relation, but noth-  58:30   ing can abolish the cares of marriage.                                Differing duties            \"She that is married careth . . . how she may please          her husband,\" says the Bible; and this is the pleasantest  59:1    thing to do. Matrimony should never be entered into          without a full recognition of its enduring obligations on  59:3    both sides. There should be the most tender          solicitude for each other's happiness, and mu-          tual attention and approbation should wait on all the years  59:6    of married life.            Mutual compromises will often maintain a compact          which might otherwise become unbearable. Man should  59:9    not be required to participate in all the annoyances and          cares of domestic economy, nor should woman be ex-          pected to understand political economy. Fulfilling the  59:12   different demands of their united spheres, their sympa-          thies should blend in sweet confidence and cheer, each          partner sustaining the other, - thus hallowing the union  59:15   of interests and affections, in which the heart finds peace          and home.                                Trysting renewed            Tender words and unselfish care in what promotes the  59:18   welfare and happiness of your wife will prove more salutary          in prolonging her health and smiles than stolid          indifference or jealousy. Husbands, hear this  59:21   and remember how slight a word or deed may renew the          old trysting-times.            After marriage, it is too late to grumble over incompati-  59:24   bility of disposition. A mutual understanding should          exist before this union and continue ever after, for decep-          tion is fatal to happiness.                              Permanent obligation    59:27   The nuptial vow should never be annulled, so long as          its moral obligations are kept intact; but the frequency          of divorce shows that the sacredness of this re-  59:30   lationship is losing its influence, and that fatal          mistakes are undermining its foundations. Separation          never should take place, and it never would, if both  60:1    husband and wife were genuine Christian Scientists.          Science inevitably lifts one's being higher in the scale of  60:3    harmony and happiness.                               Permanent affection            Kindred tastes, motives, and aspirations are necessary          to the formation of a happy and permanent companion-  60:6    ship. The beautiful in character is also the          good, welding indissolubly the links of affec-          tion. A mother's affection cannot be weaned from her  60:9    child, because the mother-love includes purity and con-          stancy, both of which are immortal. Therefore maternal          affection lives on under whatever difficulties.  60:12   From the logic of events we learn that selfishness          and impurity alone are fleeting, and that wisdom will          ultimately put asunder what she hath not joined  60:15   together.                              Centre for affections            Marriage should improve the human species, becoming          a barrier against vice, a protection to woman, strength to  60:18   man, and a centre for the affections. This,          however, in a majority of cases, is not its          present tendency, and why? Because the education of  60:21   the higher nature is neglected, and other considerations,          - passion, frivolous amusements, personal adornment,          display, and pride, - occupy thought.                                Spiritual concord    60:24   An ill-attuned ear calls discord harmony, not appreciat-          ing concord. So physical sense, not discerning the true          happiness of being, places it on a false basis.  60:27"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34585"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 2 (of 6) (#13)"],[1,"nts, or the doors, or other interior works in the  palace of the Vatican, completed without his superintendence. He  directed the pavements to be formed of _terra invetriata_, an ancient  invention of Luca della Robbia, which having continued for many  generations as a family secret, was then in the hands of another Luca.  Raffaello invited him to Florence to execute this vast work, employed  him in the gallery, and in many of the chambers, which he adorned with  the arms of the Pope. For the couches and other ornaments of the Camera  di Segnatura he brought to Rome F. Giovanni da Verona, who formed them  of mosaic with the most beautiful views. For the entablatures of the  chambers, and for several of the windows and doors, he engaged Giovanni  Barile, a celebrated Florentine engraver of gems. This work was executed  in so masterly a manner, that Louis XIII., wishing to ornament the  palace of the Louvre, had all these intaglios separately copied. The  drawings of them were made by Poussin, and Mariette boasted of having  them in his collection. Nor was there any other work either of stone or  marble for which a design was required, which did not come under the  inspection of Raffaello, and on which he did not impress his taste,  which was consummate also in the sister art of sculpture. A proof of  this is to be seen in the Jonah, in the church of the Madonna del  Popolo, in the Chigi chapel, which was executed by Lorenzetto under his  direction, and which, Bottari says, may assume its place by the side of  the Greek statues. Among his most remarkable works may be mentioned his  designs for the tapestry in the papal chapel, the subjects of which were  from the lives of the Evangelists, and the Acts of the Apostles. The  cartoons for them were both designed and coloured by Raffaello; and  after the tapestries were finished in the Low Countries, the cartoons  passed into England, where they still remain. In these tapestries the  art attained its highest pitch, nor has the world since beheld anything  to equal them in beauty. They are exposed annually in the great portico  of S. Peter, in the procession of the _Corpus Domini_, and it is  wonderful to behold the crowds that flock to see them, and who ever  regard them with fresh avidity and delight. But all these works of  Raffaello would not have contributed to the extension of art at that  period, beyond the meridian of Rome, if he had not succeeded in  extending the fruits of his genius, by the means of prints. We have  already noticed M. A. Raimondi, in the first book, and we have shewn  that this great engraver was courteously received, and was afterwards  assisted by Sanzio, whence an abundance of copies of the designs and the  works of this master have been given to the world. A fine taste was thus  rapidly propagated throughout Europe, and the beautiful style of  Raffaello began to be justly appreciated. In a short time it became the  prevailing taste, and if his maxims had remained unaltered, Italian  painting would probably have flourished for as long a period as Greek  sculpture.    In the midst of such a variety of occupations, Raffaello did not fail to  gratify the wishes of many private individuals, who were desirous of  having his designs for buildings, in which branch of art he was highly  celebrated, and also of possessing his pictures. I need only to refer to  the gallery of Agostini Chigi, which he ornamented with his own hand,  with the well known fable of Galatea. He afterwards, with the assistance  of his pupils, painted the Marriage of Psyche, at the banquet of which  he assembled all the heathen deities, with such propriety of form, with  their attendant symbols and genii, that in these fabulous subjects he  almost rivalled the Greeks. These pictures, and those also of the  chambers of the Vatican, were retouched by Maratta, with incredible  care; and the method he adopted, as described by Bellori, may serve as a  guide in similar cases. Raffaello also painted many altarpieces, with  saints generally introduced; as that Delle Contesse at Foligno, where he  introduced the Chamberlain of the Pope, alive, rather than drawn from  the life: that for S. Giovanni in Monte, at Bologna, of S. Cecilia, who,  charmed to rapture by a celestial melody, forgets her musical  instrument, which falls neglected from her hands; that for Palermo, of  Christ ascending Mount Calvary, called _dello Spasimo_, which, however  much disparaged by Cumberland, for having been retouched, is a noble  ornament of the royal collection at Madrid; and the others at Naples and  at Piacenza, which are mentioned by his biographers. He also painted S.  Michael for the King of France, and many other holy families[46] and  devotional subjects, which neither Vasari nor his other biographers have  fully enumerated.    But although the creation of these wonderful works was become a habit in  this great artist, still every part of his productions cannot be  considered as equally successful. It is known, that in the frescos of  the palace, and in the Chigi gallery, he was censured in some naked  figures for errors committed, as Vasari says, by some of his school.  Mengs, who varied his opinions at different periods of his life,  insinuates, that Raffaello for some time seemed to slumber, and did not  make those rapid strides in the art, which might have been expected from  his genius. This was, probably, when Michelangiolo was for some years  absent from Rome. But when he returned, and heard it reported that many  persons considered the paintings of Raffaello superior to his in colour,  of more beauty and grace in composition, and of a correspondent  excellence in design, whilst his works were said to possess none of  these qualities except the last; he was stimulated to avail himself of  the pencil of Fra Sebastiano, and at the same time supplied him with his  own designs. The most celebrated work which they produced in  conjunction, was a Transfiguration, in fresco, with a Flagellation, and  other figures, in a chapel of S. Peter in Montorio. Raffaello being  subsequently employed to paint a picture for the Cardinal Giulio de'  Medici, afterwards Clement VII., Sebastiano, in a sort of competition,  painted another picture of the same size. In the latter was represented  the raising of Lazarus; in the former, with the master's accustomed  spirit of emulation, the Transfiguration. \"This is a picture which  combines,\" says Mengs, \"more excellences than any of the previous works  of Raffaello. The expression in it is more exalted and more refined, the  chiaroscuro more correct, the perspective better understood, the  penciling finer, and there is a greater variety in the drapery, more  grace in the heads, and more grandeur in the style.\"[47] It represents  the mystery of the Transfiguration of Christ on the summit of Mount  Tabor. On the side of the hill he has placed a band of his disciples,  and with the happiest invention has engaged them in an action  conformable to their powers, and has thus formed an episode not beyond  the bounds of probability. A youth possessed is presented to them, that  they may expel the evil spirit that torments him; and in the possessed,  struggling with the presence of the demon, the confiding faith of the  father, the affliction of a beautiful and interesting female, and the  compassion visible in the countenances of the surrounding apostles, we  are presented with perhaps the most pathetic incident ever conceived.  Yet this part of the composition does not fix our regard so much as the  principal subject on the summit of the mountain. There the two prophets,  and the three disciples, are most admirably delineated, and the Saviour  appears enveloped in a glory emanating from the fountain of eternal  light, and surrounded by that chaste and celestial radiance, that is  reserved exclusively for the eyes of the elect. The countenance of  Christ, in which he has developed all his combined ideas of majesty and  beauty, may be considered the masterpiece of Raffaello, and seems to us  the most sublime height to which the genius of the artist, or even the  art itself, was capable of aspiring. After this effort he never resumed  his pencil, as he was soon afterwards suddenly seized with a mortal  distemper, of which he died, in the bosom of the church, on Good Friday,  (also the anniversary of his birthday,) 1520, aged thirty-seven years.  His body reposed for some days in the chamber where he was accustomed to  paint, and over it was placed this noble picture of the Transfiguration,  previous to his mortal remains being transferred to the church of the  Rotonda for interment. There was not an artist that was not moved to  tears at this affecting sight. Raffaello had always possessed the power  of engaging the affections of all with whom he was acquainted.  Respectful to his master, he obtained from the Pope an assurance that  his works, in one of the ceilings of the Vatican, should remain  unmolested; just towards his rivals, he expressed his gratitude to God  that he had been born in the days of Bonarruoti; gracious towards his  pupils, he loved them, and intrusted them as his own sons; courteous  even to strangers, he cheerfully lent his aid to all who asked his  advice; and in order to make designs for others, or to direct them in  their studies, he sometimes even neglected his own work, being alike  incapable of refusing or delaying his inestimable aid. All these  reflections forced themselves on the minds of the spectators, whose eyes  were at one moment directed to the view of his youthful remains, and of  those divine hands that had, in the imitation of her works, almost  excelled nature herself; and at another moment, to the contemplation of  this his latest production, which appeared to exhibit the dawn of a new  and wonderful style; and the painful reflection presented itself, that,  with the life of Raffaello, the brightest prospects of art were"]]]
