But in few things is the effect of this change of  motion more conspicuous than in the modern apparatus for preparing,  spinning, and weaving vegetable and other fibres into fabrics for clothing.  The simple application of rotary motion to these processes has changed the  domestic economy of the world, and increased the general comforts of our  race a hundred fold.    The birth of the arts here, and not least among them that of the humble one  of spinning, has relation to a problem in American ethnology of great and  increasing interest--_the early occupancy or first peopling of this  hemisphere_. Were there through countless ages no eyes or hearts here to  respond to the smiling heaven, none to taste the teeming fruits or inhale  the aroma of flowers? Was the placid atmosphere never moved by the prattle  and laughter of children, the songs of birds, or the sudden start of  quadrupeds arrested by the presence of the race ordained to rule over them,  until a few straggling members of that race arrived (perhaps driven hither  by tempests) from abroad, to claim the splendid heritage? If the red man  was not indigenous to the soil, if the first settlers were aliens, how  natural the desire to know who they were, whence they came, and how, and  when, and over what regions extended the first rights of preemption! to ask  whether they left no memorials in the languages that have come down to us,  in legends, manners, customs, traditions, religious observances and rites,  no signs in arts, utensils, arms, or other relics extant? whether they left  no marks in earth-works--those most lasting of records--in quarries and  entrenchments, in mines, tumuli, and mounds?    It is reasonable to suppose--and difficult to suppose otherwise--that if no  human form was ever reflected from the surfaces of these lakes and rivers,  no human voice heard in these forests, the imprint of no human foot left on  these sands, until colonized from another continent, the arts of that  continent must have been considerably advanced before the means of  transport, or inducements to emigrate, were evolved; and under any  circumstances, a knowledge of the most essential, would be brought over. Of  these, such as related to domestic habits and the occupations of women,  would be prominent, and among these spinning most of all. When once  introduced, this art could not have been lost, indispensable as it is to  the savage and demi-savage condition, and the original process or  processes, whencesoever derived, unless superseded by better, would have  been continued by every generation.    Now, if the mothers of the American race came from any of the early  advanced sections or outskirts of Eastern civilization, they brought the  distaff and spindle with them, yet nothing of the kind was found at the  conquest. It cannot of course be imagined that they, or their descendants,  could have been induced to throw the former away, and to embarrass the  movements of the latter in a calabash or basket. Efficient previous  practice, and acquired habits and expertness, could never have been laid  aside for such rude, and laborious, and unproductive substitutes. We know  that the distaff and spindle have never been lost where once known, in the  old world. Neither civil commotions or revolutions, nor duration of time,  affected them, in Egypt, Assyria, Greece, Italy, Carthage, Persia, Scythia,  Asia-Minor, or any of the great or small theatres of past history. The  laws, learning, science, arts, and races, which once flourished in those  countries, have mostly vanished, but women still spin there as they did  thirty or forty centuries ago; and so it is here also. The principal  mechanical devices of the old Mexicans, Nicaraguans, Peruvians, Chilians,  &c., are no longer known; the means by which the stone architecture, the  basaltic and porphyritic sculptures of Cusco, Uxmal, Copan, Palenque, and  other Aztec remains scattered over the continent, were achieved, are a  puzzle; yet the household labors of Indian women in those lands remain  unchanged, they spin and weave with the same apparatus, and embroider, as  did their kindred in and before the times of Atahualpa and Montezuma.    Admitting that repeated emigrations took place at periods remote as that of  the Iliad, and up to the twelfth century of our era, that arrivals,  designed or fortuitous, thus occurred, on either the Atlantic or the  Pacific, or both coasts--we might still more confidently expect to find the  distaff and spindle of the other hemisphere domiciled in this. If they were  brought at all, it was in hands practiced in their use, and tenacious of  their worth. But from the Cape of Storms in the south, to the limits of  human abodes in the north, instead of these the most awkward contrivances  prevailed when the whites came, and such still are found to prevail. The  inference therefore seems inevitable that the first colonists, and their  successors for many ages, came before spinning was known in their native  places, or at least before the distaff had been added to the spindle; and  that the art, as practised by the Aztecs and their successors in Central  America at the present day, is purely of aboriginal development, and of  remote antiquity, and had not before the Conquest come in contact with the  better processes of the other hemisphere.    Of the three epochs of human condition indicated by the materials of which  economical implements and weapons have been made--stone, bronze, and  iron--it is uncertain whether the distaff was ever developed under the  first. The probabilities are that it was not. In the remote periods in  which it is mentioned, some of those who possessed it had advanced far into  the second, and some had entered on the third. The great mass of the  occupants of this hemisphere at the time of the Conquest were toiling in  the cycle of stone; while the Mexicans and Peruvians, the most advanced of  the red nations, had discovered and applied the properties of copper and  some of its alloys: had entered on the second, but had not progressed far  into it. Had they possessed bronze weapons equal to those of the heroic  ages, they might yet have preserved, in a measure, their independence and  nationality.    Clothing is second only to food, and the clothing of nations in any degree  civilized is of woven thread. The all but paramount importance of the  manufacture of thread materials--including that made of flax, silk, cotton,  worsted, and other fibrous materials--affords matter for great surprise.  Compare the products of the distaff and spindle of old with that of our  mills, and how difficult to realize the change which modern mechanism has  wrought! The yearly amount, the lineal extent, of thread now made--who can  measure it? It would reach from our planet to the planets in the farthest  regions of space, and almost suffice for a net-work to include the whole  system. Turn from the wood-cut illustrations here given of ancient and not  yet obsolete processes, to modern manufactures, and it would seem that  while in the space of time which it took Grecian Helens, Syrian Naahmahs,  or Mexican Penelopes, to prepare an annual supply of clews for their  families, the myriads of spindles now twirling, by steam and water, produce  enough to use the Asteroids as balls on which to wind it and as bobbins  from which to reel it. Even a century ago, a single mill, driven by water,  is said to have spun or reeled 73,726 yards of silk--_i.e._, between forty  and fifty miles--at each revolution of the motive axle.

Some  tuskers will attack the tiger, which is nearly as bad a fault as running  in the opposite direction; but the generality, even if tolerably steady,  will swing suddenly upon one side, and thus interrupt the steadiness of  aim.    The elephant should never exercise its own will, but ought to wait in  all cases for the instructions of the mahout, and then obey immediately.    Such an animal, combining the proportions and the qualities I have  described, might be worth in India about / 1500 to any Indian Rajah, but  there may be some great native sportsmen who would give double that  amount for such an example of perfection, which would combine the beauty  required for a state elephant, with the high character of a shikar  animal.    Native princes and rajahs take a great pride in the trappings of their  state elephants, which is exhibited whenever any pageant demands an  extraordinary display. I have seen cloths of silk so closely embroidered  with heavy gold as to be of enormous value, and so great a weight that  two men could barely lift them. Such cloths may have been handed down  from several generations, as they are seldom used excepting in the state  ceremonies which occur at distant intervals. A high caste male elephant  in its gold trappings, with head-piece and forehead lap equally  embroidered, and large silver bells suspended from its tusks, is a  magnificent object during the display attending a durbar. At such an  occasion there may be a hundred elephants all in their finery, each  differing from the other both in size and in the colours of their  surroundings.    The outfit for an elephant depends upon the work required. The first  consideration is the protection of the back. Although the skin appears  as though it could resist all friction, it is astonishing how quickly a  sore becomes established, and how difficult this is to heal. The mahouts  are exceedingly careless, and require much supervision; the only method  to ensure attention is to hold them responsible and to deduct so many  rupees from their pay should the backs of their animals be unsound.    With proper care an elephant ought never to suffer, as the pad should be  made to fit its figure specially. The usual method is to cover the back  from the shoulders to the hips with a large quilted pad stuffed with  cotton, about 2 1/2 inches thick. In my opinion, wool is preferable to  cotton, and, instead of this coverlet being compact, there should be  an opening down the centre, to avoid all pressure upon the spine. A  quilted pad stuffed with wool, 3 inches thick, with an opening down the  middle, would rest comfortably upon the animal's back, and would  entirely relieve the highly-arched backbone, which would thus be exposed  to a free current of air, and would remain hard instead of becoming  sodden through perspiration. Upon this soft layer the large pad is  fixed. This is made of the strongest sacking, stuffed as tight as  possible with dried reeds of a tough variety that is common in most  tanks; this is open in the centre and quite a foot thick at the sides,  so that it fills up the hollow, and rests the weight upon the ribs at a  safe distance from the spine.    There are various contrivances in the shape of saddles. The ordinary  form for travelling is the char-jarma; this is an oblong frame,  exceedingly strong, which is lashed upon the pad secured by girths. It  is stuffed with cotton, and neatly covered with native cloth. A stuffed  back passes down the centre like a sofa, and two people on either side  sit dos-a-dos, as though in an Irish car. Iron rails protect the ends,  and swing foot-boards support the feet. This is, in my opinion, the most  comfortable way of riding, but some care is necessary in proportioning  the weights to ensure a tolerable equilibrium, otherwise, should the  route be up and down steep nullahs, the char-jarma will shift upon one  side, and become most disagreeable to those who find themselves on the  lower level. Natives prefer a well-stuffed pad, as they are accustomed  to sit with their legs doubled up in a manner that would be highly  uncomfortable to Europeans. Such pads are frequently covered with  scarlet cloth and gold embroidery, while the elephant is dressed in a  silk and gold cloth reaching to its knees. The face and head are painted  in various colours and devices, exhibiting great taste and skill on the  part of the designer. It is curious to observe the dexterity with which  an otherwise ignorant mahout will decorate the head of his animal by  drawing most elaborate curves and patterns, that would tax the ability  of a professional artist among Europeans.    The howdah is the only accepted arrangement for sporting purposes, and  much attention is necessary in its construction, as the greatest  strength should be combined with lightness. There ought to be no doors,  as they weaken the solidity of the whole. The weight of a good roomy  howdah should not exceed two hundredweight, or at the outside 230  pounds. It must be remembered that the howdah is not adapted for  travelling, as there is a disagreeable swinging motion inseparable from  its position upon the elephant's back which is not felt upon either the  pad or the char-jarma. The howdah is simply for shooting, as you can  fire in any direction, which is impossible from any other contrivance  where the rider sits in a constrained position.    A good howdah should be made of exceedingly strong and tough wood for  the framework, dovetailed, and screwed together, the joints being  specially secured by long corner straps of the best iron. The frame  ought to be panelled with galvanised wire of the strongest description,  the mesh being one-half inch. The top rail, of a hard wood, should be  strengthened all around the howdah by the addition of a male bamboo 1  1/2 inch in diameter, securely lashed with raw hide, so as to bind the  structure firmly together, and to afford a good grip for the hand. As  the howdah is divided into two compartments, the front being for the  shooter, and the back part for his servant, the division should be  arranged to give increased strength to the construction by the firmness  of the cross pieces, which ought to bind the sides together in forming  the middle seat; the back support of which should be a padded shield of  thick leather, about 15 inches in diameter, secured by a broad strap of  the same material to buckles upon the sides. This will give a yielding  support to the back of the occupant when sitting. The seat should lift  up, and be fitted as a locker to contain anything required; and a  well-stuffed leather cushion is indispensable. The gun-rack should be  carefully arranged to contain two guns upon the left, and one upon the  right of the sitter. These must be well and softly padded, to prevent  friction. The floor should be covered either with thick cork or  cork-matting to prevent the feet from slipping.    It must be remembered that a howdah may be subjected to the most severe  strain, especially should a tiger spring upon the head of an elephant,  and the animal exert its prodigious strength to throw off its assailant.  The irons for fastening the girths should therefore be of the toughest  quality, and, instead of actual girths, only thick ropes of cotton ought  to be used. A girth secured with a buckle is most dangerous, as, should  the buckle give way, an accident of the most alarming kind must  assuredly occur. The howdah ought to be lashed upon the elephant by six  folds of the strong cotton rope described, tightened most carefully  before starting. It should be borne in mind that much personal attention  is necessary during this operation, as the natives are most careless.  Two or three men ought to sit in the howdah during the process of  lacing, so as to press it down tightly upon the pad, otherwise it will  become loose during the march, and probably lean over to one side, which  is uncomfortable to both man and beast. A large hide of the sambur deer,  well cured and greased so as to be soft and pliable, should, invariably  protect the belly of the elephant, and the flanks under the fore legs,  from the friction of the girthing rope. The breastplate and crupper also  require attention. These ought to be of the same quality of cotton rope  as used for the girths, but that portion of the crupper which passes  beneath the tail should pass through an iron tube bent specially to fit,  like the letter V elongated, U. This is a great safeguard against  galling, and I believe it was first suggested by Mr. G. P. Sanderson.    A fine male elephant, well accoutred with his howdah thoroughly secured,  and a good mahout, is a splendid mount, and the rider has the  satisfaction of feeling that his animal is well up to his weight. I do  not know a more agreeable sensation than the start in the early morning  upon a thoroughly dependable elephant, with all the belongings in  first-rate order, and a mahout who takes a real interest in his work; a  thorough harmony exists between men and beast, the rifles are in their  places, and you feel prepared for anything that may happen during the  hazardous adventures of the day.    But how much depends upon that mahout! It is impossible for an ordinary  bystander to comprehend the secret signs which are mutually understood  by the elephant and his guide, the gentle pressure of one toe, or the  compression of one knee, or the delicate touch of a heel, or the almost  imperceptible swaying of the body to one side; the elephant detects  every movement, howsoever slight, and it is thus mysteriously guided by  its intelligence; the mighty beast obeys the unseen helm of thought,  just as a huge ship yields by apparent instinct to the insignificant  appendage which directs her course, the rudder. All good riders know the  mystery of a \"good hand\" upon a horse; this is a thing that is  understood, but cannot be described"]]]
