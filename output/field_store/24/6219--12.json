For he knew that it must be almost,  if not quite, unprotected.    One of the French mutineers who had deserted Laudonnière was now  in the Spanish fort.  He would show the way.  Full of this splendid  idea, eager to carry it out at once, he ordered Mass to be said,  then he called a council and laid his plan before his officers.  They, however, met his eagerness with coldness.  It was a mad and  hopeless plan, they thought, and they did their best to dissuade  Menendez from it.  But Menendez was determined to go.    \"Comrades,\" he said, \"it is now that we must show our courage and  our zeal.  This is God's war, and we must not turn our backs upon  it.  It is war against heretics, and we must wage it with blood and  with fire.\"    But the Spanish leader's eager words awoke no response in the  hearts of his hearers.  They answered him only with mutterings.  Still Menendez insisted.  The debate grew stormy, and angry words  were flung this way and that.    At length, however, Menendez had his way.  The clamour was stilled,  the officers gave a grudging consent, and preparations for the  march were begun.  In a few days all was ready, and the expedition  set out.  It was a simple matter.  There was no great train of  sumpter mules or baggage wagons.  Each man carried his own food and  ammunition, and twenty axemen marched in front of the little army  to cleave a way through the forest.    The storm still raged.  Rain fell in torrents, and the wind howled  ceaselessly as on and on the men trudged.  They plunged through  seas of mud, and grass which grew waist high, and threaded their  way along the narrow paths cloven for them by the axemen.    So for three days they toiled onward.  Their food was gone, their  ammunition soaked, they were drenched to the skin, footsore and  famishing, when upon the third night they lay down upon the muddy  ground, cursing their leader for having brought them forth to  died thus miserably.  But while the men cursed Menendez prayed.  All  night he prayed.  And before day dawned he called his officers to a  council.  They were now within a mile of Fort Caroline, and he was  eager to attack.    But his officers were sick of the whole business.  The men were  utterly disheartened; one and all they clamoured to return.    Yet once again Menendez bent them to his will.  In the darkness of  the forest he spoke to the wretched, shivering, rain-drenched men.  He taunted, he persuaded, and at length wrung from them a sullen  consent to follow him.    So once again the miserable march was begun, and when day  dawned they stood on the hill above the fort .    No sound came from it, no watchman stood upon the ramparts.  For  towards morning, seeing that it rained harder than ever, the captain  of the guard had sent his men to bed, for they were soaked to the  skin and he was sorry for them.  In such rain and wind what enemy  would venture forth? he asked himself.  It was folly to stay abroad  on such a night he thought.  So he dismissed the guard, and went  off to bed.    Thus none heard or saw the approach of the Spaniards.  Then suddenly  the silence of the dawn was broken with fierce war cries.    \"At them,\" shouted the Spaniards, \"God is with us!\"    The sleeping Frenchmen started from their beds in terror.  Half  naked they sprang to arms.  On every side the Spaniards poured in.  The dim light of dawn showed the dark cruel faces, and the gleam  of drawn swords.  Then clash of steel, screams of frightened women  and children, curses, prayers, all mingled together in terrible  confusion.    At the first alarm Laudonnière sprang from his bed, and seizing his  sword called his men to follow him.  But the Spaniards surrounded  him, his men were slain and scattered, and he himself was forced  back into the yard of his house.  Here there was a tent.  This  stopped his pursuers, for they stumbled over the cordage and became  entangled with it.  The confusion gave Laudonnière a few minutes'  respite in which he escaped through a breach in the ramparts, and  took refuge in the forest.  A few others fleeing this way and that  escaped likewise.  But some, the first moment of terror past, resolved  to return and throw themselves on the mercy of the Spaniards rather  than face starvation in the woods.    \"They are men\" said one; \"it may be when their fury is spent they  will spare our lives.  Even if they slay us what of that? It is but  a moment's pain.  Better that than to starve here in the woods or  be torn to pieces by wild beasts.\"    Still some held back, but most agreed to throw themselves upon the  mercy of the Spaniards.    So unarmed and almost naked as they were, they turned back to give  themselves up.  But little did these simple Frenchmen understand  the fury of the foe.  When they neared the fort the Spaniards rushed  out upon them and, unheeding their cries for mercy, slew them to  a man.  Those who had held back, when they saw the fate of their  companions, fled through the forest.  Some sought refuge among the  Indians.  But even from that refuge the Spaniards hunted them forth  and slew them without pity.  Thus the land was filled with bloodshed  and ruin.  Many were slain at once by the sword, others were hanged  on trees round the fort, and over them Menendez wrote, \"I do this  not as to Frenchmen but as to Lutherans.\" Only a few miserable  stragglers, after untold sufferings, reached the little ship which  still lay at anchor in the river.  Among these was Laudonnière.    Their one desire now was to flee homewards, and unfurling their  sails they set out for France.    The colony of Fort Caroline was wiped out, and rejoicing at the  success of his bold scheme, Menendez marched back to St.  Augustine  where a Te Deum was sung in honour of this victory over heretics.    Meanwhile the Frenchmen who had set forth to attack St.  Augustine  by sea had been driven hither and thither by the storm, and at length  were wrecked.  But although the ships were lost all, or nearly all,  of the men succeeded in reaching the shore in safety.  And not knowing  what had happened at Fort Caroline they set out in two companies  to try to reach the fort by land.    But they never reached the fort.  For one morning scarcely ten days  after the destruction of Fort Caroline some Indians came to Menendez  with the news that they had seen a French ship wrecked a little to  the south.    The news delighted Menendez, and he at once set out to capture the  shipwrecked men.  It was not long before he saw the lights of the  French camp in the distance.  But on coming nearer it was seen that  they were on the other side of an arm of the sea, so that it was  impossible to reach them.  Hiding, therefore, in the bushes by the  water's edge Menendez and his men watched the Frenchmen on the other  side.  The Spaniards soon saw that their enemies were in distress.  They suspected that they were starving, for they could be seen  walking up and down the shore seeking shellfish.  But Menendez  wanted to make sure of the state they were in, and he made up his  mind to get nearer to the Frenchmen.  So he put off his fine clothes,  and dressing himself like a common sailor, got into a boat and  rowed across the water.    Seeing him come one of the Frenchmen swam out to meet him.  As he  drew near Menendez called out to him: \"Who are you, and whence come  ye?\"    \"We are followers of Ribaut, Viceroy of the King of France,\" answered  the Frenchman.\"    \"Are you Catholics or Lutherans?\" asked Menendez.    \"We are Lutherans,\" answered the man.    Then after a little more talk Menendez told who he was.    With this news the man swam back to his companions.  But he soon  returned to the boat to say that five of the French leaders wished  to speak with the Spanish leader, and begged for safe conduct to  his camp.    To this Menendez readily agreed, and returning to his own side he  sent the boat back to bring the Frenchmen over.    When they landed Menendez received them courteously.  And after  returning his ceremonious greetings the Frenchmen begged the  Spaniards to lend them a boat so that they might cross the river  which lay between them and Fort Caroline.    At this request Menendez smiled evilly. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"it  were idle for you to go to your fort.  It has been taken, and every  man is slain.\"    But the Frenchmen could not at first believe that he spoke the truth.  So in proof of his words the Spanish leader bade his men show the  heretics the plunder which had been taken from their fort.  As they  looked upon it the hearts of the Frenchmen sank.    Then ordering breakfast to be sent to them Menendez left them, and  went to breakfast with his own officers.    Breakfast over he came back to the Frenchmen, and as he looked at  their gloomy faces his heart rejoiced. \"Do you believe now,\" he  asked, \"that what I told you is true?\"    \"Yes,\" replied the Frenchmen, \"we believe.  It would be useless now  to go to the fort.  All we ask of you is to lend us ships so that  we may return home.\"    \"I would gladly do so,\" replied Menendez, \"if you were Catholics,  and if I had ships.  But I have none.\"    Then seeing that he would give them no help to reach home, the  Frenchmen begged Menendez at least to let them stay with his people  until help came to them from France.  It was little enough to ask,  they thought, as France and Spain were at peace.  But there was no  pity or kindliness in the Spanish general's heart.    \"All Catholics,\" he replied sternly, \"I would defend and succour.  But as for you, you are Lutherans, and I must hold you as enemies.  I will wage war against you with blood and fire.  I will wage it  fiercely, both by land and sea, for I am Viceroy for my King in  this country.

On reaching the foot of  the descent, where the mountain mule-path comes out into the main  road, as shown upon the map near the commencement of this article,  he turns shorts to the left, and goes on round the base of the  promontory, with the lofty declivities of the mountain on one hand,  and a mass of dense forests on the other, lying between the road  and the shore. As he passes on, the road, picturesque and romantic  from the beginning becomes gradually wild, solitary, and desolate.  It leads him sometimes through tangled thickets, sometimes under  shelving rocks, and sometimes it brings him out unexpectedly to  the shore of the sea, where he sees the surf rolling in upon the  beach at his feet, and far over the water the setting sun going  down to his rest beneath the western horizon. At length the twilight  gradually disappears, and as the shades of the evening come on,  lights glimmer in the solitary villages that he passes on his way;  but there is no welcome for him in their beaming. At length when  he deems it time to bring his day's journey to an end, he pitches  his tent by the wayside in some unfrequented spot, and before he  retires to rest for the night, comes out to take one more view of  the dark and sombre mountain which he is about to leave forever. He  stands at the door of his tent, and gazes at it long and earnestly,  before he bids it farewell, equally impressed with the sublime  magnificence of its situation and form, and with the solemn grandeur  of its history.    France was now at peace with all the world. It was universally  admitted that Napoleon was the great pacificator. He was the idol  of France. The masses of the people in Europe, every where regarded  him as their advocate and friend, the enemy of aristocratic usurpation,  and the great champion of equality. The people of France no longer  demanded liberty . Weary years of woe had taught them gladly  to relinquish the boon. They only desired a ruler who would take  care of them, govern them, protect them from the power of allied  despotism, and give them equal rights. Though Napoleon had now but  the title of First Consul, and France was nominally a republic,  he was in reality the most powerful monarch in Europe. His throne  was established in the hearts of nearly forty millions of people.  His word was law.    It will be remembered that Josephine contemplated the extraordinary  grandeur to which her husband had attained, with intense solicitude.  She saw that more that than ordinary regal power had passed into  his hands, and she was not a stranger to the intense desire which  animated his heart to have an heir to whom to transmit his name and  his glory. She knew that many were intimating to him that an heir  was essential to the repose of France. She was fully informed that  divorce had been urged upon him as one of the stern necessities of  state. One day, when Napoleon was busy in his cabinet, Josephine  entered softly, by a side door, and seating herself affectionately  upon his knee, and passing her hand gently through his hair, said  to him, with a burst of tenderness, \"I entreat you, my friend, do  not make yourself king. It is Lucien who urges you to it. Do not  listen to him.\" Napoleon smiled upon her kindly, and said, \"Why,  my poor Josephine, you are mad. You must not listen to these fables  which the old dowagers, tell you. But you interrupt me now; I am  very busy; leave me alone.\"    It is recorded that Lucien ventured to suggest to Josephine that  a law higher than the law of ordinary morality required that she  must become a mother, even were it necessary, for the attainment  of that end, that she should violate her nuptial vows. Brutalizing  and vulgar infidelity had obliterated in France, nearly all the  sacredness of domestic ties. Josephine, instinctively virtuous,  and revering the religion of her childhood, which her husband had  reinstated, bursting into tears, indignantly exclaimed, \"This is  dreadful. Wretched should I be were any one to suppose me capable  of listening, without horror, to your infamous proposal. Your  ideas are poisonous; your language horrible.\" \"Well, then, madame,\"  responded Lucien, \"all that I can say is, that from my heart I pity  you.\"    Josephine was at times almost delirious in apprehension of the  awful calamity which threatened her. She knew the intensity of her  husband's love. She also knew the boundlessness of his ambition.  She could not be blind to the apparent importance, as a matter of  state policy that Napoleon should possess an heir. She also was  fully aware that throughout France marriage had long been regarded  but as a partnership of convenience, to be formed and sundered  almost at pleasure. \"Marriage,\" said Madame de Stael, has become  but the sacrament of adultery.\" The nation, under the influence of  these views, would condemn her for selfishly refusing assent to an  arrangement apparently essential to the repose of France and of  Europe Never was a woman placed in a situation of more terrible  trial. Never was an ambitious man exposed to a more fiery temptation.  Laying aside the authority of Christianity, and contemplating the  subject in the light of mere expediency, it seemed a plain duty  for Napoleon and Josephine to separate. But gloriously does it  illustrate the immutable truth of God's word, that even in such an  exigence as this, the path which the Bible pointed out was the only  path of safety and of peace. \"In separating myself from Josephine,\"  said Napoleon afterward, \"and in marrying Maria Louisa, I placed  my foot upon an abyss which was covered with flowers.\"    Josephine's daughter, Hortense, beautiful, brilliant, and amiable,  then but eighteen years of age, was strongly attached to Duroc, one  of Napoleon's aids, a very fashionable and handsome man. Josephine,  however, had conceived the idea of marrying Hortense to Louis Bonaparte,  Napoleon's younger brother. She said, one day, to Bourrienne, \"My  two brothers-in-law are my determined enemies. You see all their  intrigues. You know how much uneasiness they have caused me. This  projected marriage with Duroc, leaves me without any support. Duroc,  independent of Bonaparte's friendship, is nothing. He has neither  fortune, rank, nor even reputation. He can afford me no protection  against the enmity of the brothers. I must have some more certain  reliance for the future. My husband loves Louis very much. If I  can succeed in uniting my daughter to him, he will prove a strong  counterpoise to the calumnies and persecutions of my brothers-in-law.\"  These remarks were reported to Napoleon. He replied, \"Josephine  labors in vain. Duroc and Hortense love each other, and they shall  be married. I am attached to Duroc. He is well born. I have given  Caroline to Murat, and Pauline to Le Clerc. I can as well give  Hortense to Duroc. He is brave. He is as good as the others. He is  general of division. Besides, I have other views for Louis.\"    In the palace the heart may throb with the same joys and griefs  as in the cottage. In anticipation of the projected marriage Duroc  was sent on a special mission to compliment the Emperor Alexander  on his accession to the throne. Duroc wrote often to Hortense while  absent. When the private secretary whispered in her ears, in the  midst of the brilliant throng of the Tuileries, \"I have a letter,\"  she would immediately retire to her apartment. Upon her return  her friends could see that her eyes were moistened with the tears  of affection and joy. Josephine cherished the hope that could she  succeed in uniting Hortense with Louis Bonaparte, should Hortense  give birth to a son, Napoleon would regard him as his heir. The  child would bear the name of Bonaparte; the blood of the Bonapartes  would circulate in his veins; and he would be the offspring  of Hortense, whom Napoleon regarded as his own daughter, and whom  he loved with the strongest parental affection. Thus the terrible  divorce might be averted. Urged by motives so powerful, Josephine  left no means untried to accomplish her purpose.    Louis Bonaparte was a studious, pensive, imaginative man, of great  moral worth, though possessing but little force of character. He  had been bitterly disappointed in his affections, and was weary  of the world. When but nineteen years of age he had formed a very  strong attachment for a young lady whom he had met in Paris. She  was the daughter of an emigrant noble, and his whole being because  absorbed in the passion of love. Napoleon, then in the midst of  those victories which paved his way to the throne of France, was  apprehensive that the alliance of his brother with one of the old  royalist families, might endanger his own ambitious projects. He  therefore sent him away on a military commission, and secured, by  his powerful instrumentality, the marriage of the young lady to  another person. The disappointment preyed deeply upon the heart  of the sensitive young man. All ambition died within him. He loved  solitude, and studiously avoided the cares and pomp of state.  Napoleon, not having been aware of the extreme strength of his  brother's attachment, when he saw the wound which he had inflicted  upon him, endeavored to make all the amends in his power. Hortense  was beautiful, full of grace and vivacity. At last Napoleon fell in  with the views of Josephine, and resolved, having united the two,  to recompense his brother, as far as possible, by lavishing great  favors upon them.    It was long before Louis would listen to the proposition of his  marriage with Hortense. His affections still clung to the lost  object of his idolatry, and he could not, without pain, think of  union with another. Indeed a more uncongenial alliance could hardly  have been imagined. In no one thing were their tastes similar.  But who could resist the combined tact of Josephine "]]]
