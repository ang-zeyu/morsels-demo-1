[Illustration: _ADMIRAL D. G. FARRAGUT_  Photograph by Brady.]    Farragut's base at Ship Island was about a hundred miles east from  the Confederate Forts Jackson and St. Philip. These forts guarded  the entrance to the Mississippi. Ninety miles above them stood  New Orleans, to which they gave protection and from which they  drew all their supplies. The result of a conference at Washington  was an order from Welles to \"reduce the defenses which guard the  approaches to New Orleans.\" But Farragut's own infinitely better  plan was to run past the forts and take New Orleans first. By doing  this he would save the extra loss required for reducing the forts  and would take the weak defenses of New Orleans entirely by surprise.  Then, when New Orleans fell, the forts, cut off from all supplies,  would have to surrender without the firing of another shot. Everything  depended on whether Farragut could run past without too much loss.  Profoundly versed in all the factors of the problem, he foresaw  that his solution would prove right, while Washington's would as  certainly be wrong. So, taking the utmost advantage of all the  freedom that his general instructions allowed, he followed a course  in which anything short of complete success would mean the ruin  of his whole career.    The forts were strong, had ninety guns that would bear on the fleet,  and were well placed, one on each side of the river. But they suffered  from all the disadvantages of fixed defenses opposed by a mobile  enemy, and their own mobile auxiliaries were far from being  satisfactory. The best of the \"River Defense Fleet,\" including  several rams, had been ordered up to Memphis, so sure was the  Confederate Government that the attack would come from the north.  Two home-made ironclads were failures. The _Louisiana's_ engines  were not ready in time; and her captain refused to be towed into the  position near the boom where he could do the enemy most harm. The  _Mississippi_, a mere floating house, built by ordinary carpenters,  never reached the forts at all and was burnt by her own men at New  Orleans.    Farragut felt sure of his fleet. He had four splendid new men-of-war  that formed a homogeneous squadron, four other sizable warships, and  nine new gunboats. All spars and rigging that could be dispensed  with were taken down; all hulls camouflaged with Mississippi mud; and  all decks whitened for handiness at night. A weak point, however,  was the presence of mortar-boats that would have been better out  of the way altogether. These boats had been sent to bombard the  forts, which, according to the plan preferred by the Government,  were to be taken before New Orleans was attacked. In other words,  the Government wished to cut off the branches first; while Farragut  wished to cut down the tree itself, knowing the branches must fall  with the trunk.    On the eighteenth of April the mortar-boats began heaving shells  at the forts. But, after six days of bombardment, the forts were  nowhere near the point of surrendering, and the supply of shells  had begun to run low.    Meanwhile the squadron had been busy preparing for the great ordeal.  The first task was to break the boom across the river. This boom  was placed so as to hold the ships under the fire of the forts;  and the four-knot spring current was so strong that the eight-knot  ships could not make way enough against it to cut clear through  with certainty. Moreover, the middle of the boom was filled in by  eight big schooners, chained together, with their masts and rigging  dragging astern so as to form a most awkward entanglement. Farragut's  fleet captain, Henry H. Bell, taking two gunboats, _Itasca_ and  _Pinola_, under Lieutenants Caldwell and Crosby, slipped the chains  of one schooner; whereupon this schooner and the _Itasca_ swung  back and grounded under fire of the forts. The _Pinola_ gallantly  stood by, helping _Itasca_ clear. Then Caldwell, with splendid  audacity and skill, steamed up through the narrow gap, turned round,  put on the _Itasca's_ utmost speed, and, with the current in his  favor, charged full tilt against the chains that still held fast.  For one breathless moment the little _Itasca_ seemed lost. Her  bows rose clear out, as, quivering from stem to stern, she was  suddenly brought up short from top speed to nothing. But, in another  fateful minute, with a rending crash, the two nearest schooners  gave way and swept back like a gate, while the _Itasca_ herself  shot clear and came down in triumph to the fleet.    The passage was made on the twenty-fourth, in line-ahead (that  is, one after another) because Farragut found the opening narrower  than he thought it should be for two columns abreast, at night, under  fire, and against the spring current. Owing to the configuration of  the channel the starboard column had to weigh first, which gave  the lead to the 500-ton gunboat _Cayuga_. This was the one weak  point, because the leading vessel, drawing most fire, should have  been the strongest. The fault was Farragut's; for his heart got  the better of his head when it came to placing Captain Theodorus  Bailey, his dauntless second-in-command, on board a vessel fit  to lead the starboard column. He could not bear to obscure any  captain's chances of distinction by putting another captain over  him. So Bailey was sent to the best vessel commanded by a lieutenant.    The _Cayuga's_ navigating officer, finding that the guns of the  forts were all trained on midstream, edged in towards Fort St.  Philip. His masts were shot to pieces, but his hull drew clear  without great damage. \"Then,\" he says, \"I looked back for some  of our vessels; and my heart jumped up into my mouth when I found  I could not see a single one. I thought they must all have been  sunk by the forts.\" But not a ship had gone down. The three big  ones of the starboard column--_Pensacola, Mississippi_, and  _Oneida_--closed with the fort (so that the gunners on both sides  exchanged jeers of defiance) and kept up a furious fire till the  lighter craft astern slipped past safely and joined the _Cayuga_  above.    Meanwhile the _Cayuga_ had been attacked by a mob of Mississippi  steamers, six of which belonged to the original fourteen blessed  with their precious independence by Secretary Benjamin, \"backed  by the whole Missouri Delegation.\" So when the rest of the Federal  light craft came up, \"all sorts of things happened\" in a general  free fight. There was no lack of Confederate courage; but an utter  absence of concerted action and of the simplest kind of naval skill,  except on the part of the two vessels commanded by ex-officers  of the United States Navy. The Federal light craft cut their way  through their unorganized opponents as easily as a battalion of  regulars could cut through a mob throwing stones. But the only  two Confederate naval officers got clear of the scrimmage and did  all that skill could do with their makeshift little craft against  the Federal fleet. Kennon singled out the _Varuna_ (the only one of  Farragut's vessels that was not a real man-of-war), raked her stern  with the two guns of his own much inferior vessel, the _Governor  Moore_, and rammed her into a sinking condition. Warley flew at  bigger game with his little ram, the _Manassas_, trying three of  the large men-of-war, one after another, as they came upstream. The  _Pensacola_ eluded him by a knowing turn of her helm that roused  his warmest admiration. The _Mississippi_ caught the blow glancingly  on her quarter and got off with little damage. The _Brooklyn_ was  taken fair and square amidships; but, though her planking was crushed  in, she sprang no serious leak and went on with the fight. The  wretched little Confederate engines had not been able to drive the  ram home.    The _Brooklyn_ was the flagship _Hartford's_ next-astern and the  _Richmond's_ next-ahead, these three forming the main body of Farragut's  own port column, which followed hard on the heels of the starboard  one, so hard, indeed, that there were only twenty minutes between  the first shot fired by the forts at the _Cayuga_ and the first  shot fired by the _Hartford_ at the forts. Besides the forts there  was the _Louisiana_ floating battery that helped to swell the storm  of shot and shell; and down the river came a fire-raft gallantly  towed by a tug. The _Hartford_ sheered off, over towards Fort St.  Philip, under whose guns she took ground by the head while the  raft closed in and set her ablaze. Instantly the hands on fire  duty sprang to their work. But the flames rushed in through the  ports; and the men were forced a step back. Farragut at once called  out: \"Don't flinch from the fire, boys. There's a hotter fire than  that for those who don't do their duty!\" Whereupon they plied their  hoses to such good effect that the fire was soon got under control.  Farragut calmly resumed his walk up and down the poop, while the  gunners blew the gallant little tug to bits and smashed the raft  in pieces. Then he stood keenly watching the _Hartford_ back clear,  gather way, and take the lead upstream again. Every now and then  he looked at the pocket compass that hung from his watch chain;  though, for the most part, he tried to scan a scene of action lit  only by the flashes of the guns. The air was dense and very still;  so the smoke of guns and funnels hung like a pall over both the  combatants while the desperate fight went on.    At last the fleet fought through and reached the clearer atmosphere  above the forts; all but the last three gunboats, which were driven  back by the fire. Then Farragut immediately sent word to General  Benjamin F. Butler that the troops could be brought up by the bayous  that ran parallel to the river out of range of the forts. But the  General, having taken in the situation at a "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26490"],[0,"Lord Milner's Work in South Africa (#13)"],[1," personality of exceptional vigour and capacity.  When, therefore, Lord Rosmead intimated his desire to be relieved of  the heavy responsibility of the joint offices of High Commissionship  for South Africa and Governor of the Cape Colony no attempt to  dissuade him was made. His health had been enfeebled for some time  past, and he did not long survive his return to England. Both in  Australia and at the Cape he had devoted his strength and ability to  the service of the Empire. In the years 1883-5 he had resolutely and  successfully opposed the attempt of the Transvaal Boers to seize  Bechuanaland. His failure to control his powerful and impatient Prime  Minister is mitigated by the circumstance that it was solely on the  ground of public interest that, upon the retirement of Lord Loch in  1895, he had allowed himself, in spite of his advanced years and  indifferent health, to assume the office of High Commissioner for a  third time.          CHAPTER III    A YEAR OF OBSERVATION      Lord Rosmead retired early in 1897. It is said that three men so  different in character as Lord Salisbury, Mr. Chamberlain, and Mr.  Stead, each separately fixed upon the same name as being that of the  man most capable of undertaking the position of High Commissioner in  South Africa--a position always difficult, but now more than ever  arduous and responsible. To nine out of every ten men with whom he had  been brought into contact there was little in Sir Alfred Milner--as he  then was--to distinguish him from other high-principled, capable, and  pleasant-mannered heads of departments in the Civil Service. His  _metier_ was finance, and his accomplishment literature. Commencing  with journalism and an unsuccessful contest (in the Liberal interest)  for the Harrow division of Middlesex, he had been private secretary to  Lord Goschen, Under-Secretary for Finance in Egypt, and Head of the  Inland Revenue. In this latter office he had given invaluable  assistance to Sir William Harcourt, then Chancellor of the Exchequer,  in respect of what is perhaps the most successful of recent methods  of raising revenue--the death duties. The principle of the graduated  death duties was Harcourt's; but it was Milner who worked out the  elaborate system which rendered his ideas coherent, and enabled them  eventually to be put into effect. Academic distinctions, however  ample, cannot be said to-day to afford a definite assurance of  pre-eminent capacity for the service of the State. Yet it was  certainly no disadvantage to Sir Alfred Milner to have been a scholar  of Balliol, or a President of the Oxford Union.[26] Whatever direct  knowledge the educated public had of him was based probably upon the  impression created by his book _England in Egypt_. This was a work  which indicated that its author had formed high ideals of English  statesmanship, and that his experience of a complex administrative  system, working in a political society full of intrigue and  international jealousy, had developed in him the rare qualities of  insight and humour. Some of his readers might have reflected that an  active association with so accomplished a master of financial and  administrative method as Lord Cromer was in itself a useful equipment  for a colonial administrator.             [Footnote 26: Mr. Bodley, in his _Coronation of King Edward           VII._, remarks that of the seventy Balliol scholars elected           during the mastership of Jowett (1870-1893) only three had at           that time (1902) \"attained eminence in any branch of public           life.\" These three were Mr. H. H. Asquith, Dr. Charles Gore           (then Bishop of Worcester), and Lord Milner.]    [Sidenote: Sir Alfred Milner.]    But the British public, both in England and South Africa, took their  view of the appointment from the opinions expressed by the many  prominent men to whom Sir Alfred Milner was personally known. The  leaders and the Press of both parties were unstinted in approval of  the choice which Mr. Chamberlain had made. The banquet given to Sir  Alfred Milner three weeks before his departure to the Cape (March  28th, 1897) provided an occasion for an expression of unrestrained  admiration and confidence unique in the annals of English public life.  \"He has the union of intellect with fascination that makes men mount  high,\" wrote Lord Rosebery. And Sir William Harcourt, \"the most  grateful and obliged\" of Milner's \"many friends and admirers,\"  pronounced him to be \"a man deserving of all praise and all  affection.\" Mr. Asquith, who presided, stated in a speech marked  throughout by a note of intimate friendliness that \"no appointment of  our time has been received with a larger measure both of the  approbation of experienced men and of the applause of the public.\" The  office itself was \"at the present moment the most arduous and  responsible in the administrative service of the country.\" Not only  \"embarrassing problems,\" but \"formidable personalities\" would confront  the new High Commissioner for South Africa:         \"But,\" he added, \"we know that he takes with him as clear an       intellect and as sympathetic an imagination, and, if need should       arise, a power of resolution as tenacious and as inflexible as       belongs to any man of our acquaintance.\"    Milner's reply is significant of the spirit in which he had undertaken  his task. Like Rhodes, he had found in his Oxford studies the reasoned  basis for an enlightened Imperialism. Chief among his earliest  political convictions was the belief that--         \"there was no political object comparable in importance with that       of preventing a repetition of such a disaster [as the loss of the       United States]: the severance of another link in the great       Imperial chain.... It is a great privilege to be allowed to fill       any position in the character of what I may be, perhaps, allowed       to call a 'civilian soldier of the Empire.' To succeed in it, to       render any substantial service to any part of our world-wide       State, would be all that in any of my most audacious dreams I had       ever ventured to aspire to. But in a cause in which one       absolutely believes, even failure--personal failure, I mean, for       the cause itself is not going to fail--would be preferable to an       easy life of comfortable prosperity in another sphere.\"    [Sidenote: Personal traits.]    This was the man who was sent to maintain the interests of the  paramount Power in a South Africa shaken by racial antagonism, and  already feverish with political intrigue and commercial rivalry. Of  all the tributes of the farewell banquet, Sir William Harcourt's was  closest to the life--\"worthy of all praise and all affection.\" The  quality of inspiring affection to which this impressive phrase bore  witness was one which had made itself felt among the humblest of those  who were fortunate enough to have been associated with Lord Milner in  any public work. Long after Milner had left Egypt, the face of the  Syrian or Coptic Effendi of the Finance Department in Cairo would  light up at the chance mention of the genial Englishman who had once  been his chief. And in remote English counties revenue officials still  hang his portrait upon the walls of their lodgings. Such men had no  claim to appraise his professional merit or his gifts of intellect;  but their feelings were responsive to the charm of his nature. \"He was  so considerate\": that was their excuse for retaining his name and  personality among the pleasant memories of the past. But the other  side of Milner's character, the power of \"tenacious and inflexible  resolution,\" of which Mr. Asquith spoke, was destined to be brought  into play so prominently during the \"eight dusky years\" of his South  African administration, that to the distant on-looker it came to be  accepted as the characterising quality of the man. To some Milner  became the \"man of blood and iron\"; determined, like Bismarck, to  secure the unity of a country by trampling with iron-shod boots upon  the liberties of its people: even as in the view of others his clear  mental vision--never more clear than in South Africa--became clouded  by an adopted partisanship, and he was a \"lost mind.\" Nothing could be  further from the truth. If the man lived who could have turned the  Boer and Afrikander from hatred and distrust of England and English  ideas by personal charm and honourable dealing, it was the man who  had universally inspired all his former associates, whether equals or  subordinates, with admiration and affection. Whatever bitterness was  displayed against Lord Milner personally by the Boer and Afrikander  leaders after the issue of the war was decided was due to their  perception that he was then--as always--a source of strength and an  inspiration for renewed effort to those whom they regarded as their  rivals or opponents. They hated him just as the French hated  Bismarck--because he was the strong man on the other side.    Lord Milner's inflexibility was, in its essence, a keener perception  of duty than the ordinary: it was a determination to do what he  believed to be for the good of South Africa and the Empire,  irrespective of any consideration of personal or party relationship.  It was in no sense the incapacity to measure the strength of an  opponent, still less did it arise from any failure to perceive the  cogency of an opinion in conflict with his own. Before the eight years  of his administration had passed, Lord Milner's knowledge of the needs  of South Africa and the Empire had become so profound that it carried  him ahead of the most enlightened and patriotic of the home statesmen  who supported him loyally to the end. Through the period of the war,  when the issues were simple and primitive, they were wholly with him.  But afterwards they supported him not so much because they understood  the methods which he employed and the objects at which he"]]]
