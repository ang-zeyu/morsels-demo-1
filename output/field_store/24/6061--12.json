In the year 990 a famine raged over  the whole of England; in 1126 there was a terrible scarcity. Wheat was  sold at 6_s._ a horseload. Now, in the twelfth century a shilling meant  more than a pound of our money, in purchasing power. It is not stated  how much constituted a horseload. It would probably mean the filling of  the two baskets hanging on either side of the packhorse. In 1257, after  a wet season and a bad harvest, wheat rose to 24_s._ a quarter, a price  which prohibited all but the richest from eating wheaten bread. It is  said that 20,000 perished of starvation. In 1316, after the same cause,  wheat became so scarce that its price rose to 4_l._ a quarter. So great  was the distress this year, that great nobles had to dismiss their  retainers; the roads in the country were crowded with robbers. Robberies  were openly committed in the streets for the sake of food: in the  prisons the unfortunate criminals, left to starve, murdered and devoured  each other. The people ate carrion and dead dogs. In 1335 there was  another time of scarcity and suffering; in 1439, the distress was so  great that the people made bread of fern roots and ivy berries. Then,  for the first time, we read of the famine being assuaged by the arrival  of rye from Prussia. In 1527 a threatened famine was checked by the  Hanseatic merchants who gave, or sold, a hundred quarters of wheat to  the City and sent three ships to Dantzig for more. In 1593 and in 1597  wheat rose to an enormous price. The last time of scarcity was during  the long war with France, which lasted, from 1792 to 1815, nearly a  quarter of a century. We were then compelled to depend almost entirely  upon our own harvests. Wheat went up as high as 103_s._ a quarter.    At no time did the poorer classes depend much upon wheat. Rye and oats  made the bread of the working people. But bad harvests affected rye and  oats as much as wheat.    The famine prices of wheat may be explained by the following facts. In  the reign of Henry I., at ordinary prices, bread enough for one meal for  100 men could be bought for a shilling and a whole sheep cost fourpence.  In the next century, when wheat was at 6_s._ a quarter, a farthing loaf  was to weigh 24 oz. whole meal and 16 oz. white. When it was at 1_s._  6_d._ a quarter the farthing loaf was to weigh 96 oz. whole grain and 64  oz. white. The quartern loaf of 4 lb. or 64 oz. now costs 5_d._, wheat  being very cheap. So that prices in time of plenty being supposed the  same, money was worth twenty times in that century as much as it is  worth now. In the reign of Edward I. wheat went down to 1_s._ a quarter.    The food of the craftsmen in London was, in ordinary times, plentiful  and cheap. The City, as we have seen, was always remarkable for the  great abundance of provision which was brought there. And there is every  reason to believe that while the rustic fared poorly and was underfed,  the craftsman of the towns always enjoyed good food and enough of it.  This made a time of scarcity hard to bear for one who habitually lived  well.    Once or twice an attempt was made to provide the City with granaries in  case of famine. Thus the origin of Leadenhall, the great City market,  was the erecting of a public granary here by Sir Simon Eyre in 1419.  Attached to the Hall, after the manner of the time, was a chapel  dedicated to the Holy Trinity, which the founder endowed for 60 priests  who were to prepare service every day for those who frequented the  market.    Another public granary was established in 1610 at Bridewell Palace. This  was built to contain 6,000 quarters of wheat.    Nothing more is heard about these public granaries. Probably the public  mind grew more assured on the subject of famine as it became better  understood that the loss of one country might be made up from the  superfluous harvests of another. The lesson taught by the Hanseatic  merchants in sending to Prussia for corn was not likely to be lost.    At the present moment, with means of transport always in readiness and  the electric wire joining the most distant countries, it might seem that  famine was a thing no longer to be feared. There cannot be bad harvests  all over the world. Not only can we every year import so much wheat that  we need grow little in this country, but we import frozen meat in vast  quantities: we bring fruit of all kinds from the most distant countries,  insomuch that there are some fruits, such as apples, oranges, grapes,  bananas, which we can enjoy the whole year round. But famine may yet  play a great and a disastrous part in our history. We must not forget  that we enjoy our present abundance of all things on one of two  conditions; first, that we are strong enough to protect the waterway and  keep it open, or, secondly, that we remain at peace. The latter we  cannot hope to do always. Therefore it is of vital importance that we  maintain a strong fleet, well equipped, ready to fight, at all times and  at the shortest notice, superior to any likely combination that may be  brought against us. Therefore, again, it behoves every man in these  Isles to be jealous of the fleet, for a time may come when the way of  the ocean may be closed and when Great Britain, through the neglect of  her rulers, may be starved into a shameful and ruinous surrender.          23. ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.    PART I.      When London was converted to Christianity, in the year 610, the first  Bishop of London, Mellitus, built a church on the highest ground within  the walls of the City. This church he dedicated to St. Paul the Apostle  who first preached to the Gentiles. What kind of church this  was--whether great or small--whether of wood or of stone--how often  rebuilt or repaired--we know not. Probably it was quite a small church  at first. This church, or its successor, was taken down in the year 1087  when Bishop Maurice began to build a new and far more stately Cathedral.  Fifty years later most of the church, not yet completed, was burned  down. Its building, thus delayed, was continued for nearly two  centuries. The steeple was not completed, for instance, till a hundred  and fifty years after the commencement of the building. The drawing  shows the church as it was in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  Old St. Paul's was one of the largest churches in Europe: its length was  at least 600 feet; the spire reached the height of 460 feet. The church  stood in a large walled enclosure, still kept partly open, though the  wall has long since been pulled down and there have been encroachments  on the north side.    [Illustration: LONDON BEFORE THE SPIRE OF ST. PAUL'S WAS BURNED: SHOWING  ALSO THE BRIDGE, THE TOWER, SHIPPING, ETC.]    The church in the fourteenth century was not regarded only as a place  for public worship. Masses and services of all kinds were going on all  day long: the place was bright, not only with the sunlight streaming  through the painted glass, but with wax tapers burning before many a  shrine--at some, all day and all night. People came to the church to  walk about, for rest, for conversation, for the transaction of  business--to make or receive payments: to hire servants. The middle  aisle of the church where all this was done was called Paul's Walk or  Duke Humphrey's Walk. Here were tables where twelve licensed scribes sat  writing letters for those who wanted their services. They would also  prepare a lease, a deed, a conveyance--any legal document. The church  was filled with tombs and monuments, some of these very ancient, some of  the greatest interest. Here was one called the tomb of Duke  Humphrey--Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, who was really buried at St.  Alban's. On May Day the watermen used to come to St. Paul's in order to  sprinkle water and strew herbs upon this tomb--I know not why. Those who  were out of work and went dinnerless were said to dine with Duke  Humphrey: and there was a proverb--'Trash and trumpery is the way to  Duke Humphrey.' Trumpery being used in its original  meaning--_tromperie_--_deceit_. Among other tombs there were those of  the Saxon Kings Sebbi and Ethelred. The first of these was King of the  East Saxons. He was converted by Bishop Erkenwald. The second was the  elder brother of King Alfred. There were tombs or shrines to many saints  now forgotten--that of St. Erkenwald, whose fame rivalled that of Edward  the Confessor at Westminster, St. Cuthbert at Durham, and St. Thomas a  Becket at Canterbury: that of St. Ethelbert: that of St. Roger, Bishop  of London--a cope which St. Roger wore is still preserved in the  Sacristy: and that of St. Wilford. At every one of these shrines  miracles were wrought--or believed to be wrought. There was also a  miraculous crucifix said to have been discovered by Lucius, the first  Christian King of ancient Britain in the year 140. Great gifts were  constantly made to this crucifix.    Under the Cathedral, in the crypt, was a parish church--that of St.  Faith's--it is now united with the parish church of St. Augustine's in  Watling Street.    [Illustration: OLD ST. PAUL'S, FROM THE EAST.    (_Showing its condition just before the Great Fire; from an engraving by  Hollar._)]    Outside the church, almost against the south wall, was the parish church  of St. Gregory. In the same way the parish church of St. Margaret's  stands outside Westminster Abbey. Within, we can see, in imagination,  the people walking about--they have not yet begun to stand bareheaded in  church--some dictating to the scribes: some leaning against the tombs:  some sitting on the bases of the great round pillars--there were no  pews, benches, or chairs in the Cathedral: the chantry priests are  saying masses in the chapels: the people are kneeling before the golden  shrine of St. Erkenwald, resplendent with lights, jewels, gold, and  silver: women lay their offerings before the miraculous crucifix praying  for the restoration to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2800"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#13)"],[1,"the meed of your toils.\"    Thus recompense we the good.

Of the great NEWS.1    The theme of their disputes.    Nay! they shall certainly knows its truth!    Again. Nay! they shall certainly know it.    Have we not made the Earth a couch?    And the mountains its tent-stakes?    We have created you of two sexes,    And ordained your sleep for rest,    And ordained the night as a mantle,    And ordained the day for gaining livelihood,    And built above you seven solid2 heavens,    And placed therein a burning lamp;    And we send down water in abundance from the rain-clouds,    That we may bring forth by it corn and herbs,    And gardens thick with trees.    Lo! the day of Severance is fixed;    The day when there shall be a blast on the trumpet, and ye shall come in  crowds,    And the heaven shall be opened and be full of portals,    And the mountains shall be set in motion, and melt into thin vapour.    Hell truly shall be a place of snares,    The home of transgressors,    To abide therein ages;    No coolness shall they taste therein nor any drink,    Save boiling water and running sores;    Meet recompense!    For they looked not forward to their account;    And they gave the lie to our signs, charging them with falsehood;    But we noted and wrote down all:    \"Taste this then: and we will give you increase of nought but torment.\"    But, for the God-fearing is a blissful abode,    Enclosed gardens and vineyards;    And damsels with swelling breasts, their peers in age,    And a full cup:    There shall they hear no vain discourse nor any falsehood:    A recompense from thy Lord-sufficing gift!-    Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and of all that between3 them lieth-the  God of Mercy! But not a word shall they obtain from Him.    On the day whereon the Spirit4 and the Angels shall be ranged in order, they  shall not speak: save he whom the God of Mercy shall permit, and who shall  say that which is right.    This is the sure day. Whoso then will, let him take the path of return to his  Lord.    Verily, we warn you of a chastisement close at hand:    The day on which a man shall see the deeds which his hands have sent before  him; and when the unbeliever shall say, \"Oh! would I were dust!\"      _______________________    1 Of the Resurrection. With regard to the date of this Sura, we can only be  guided (I) by the general style of the earlier portion (to verse 37, which is  analogous to that of the early Meccan Suras; (2) by verse 17, which pre-  supposes lxxvii. 12; (3) by the obviously later style of verse 37 to the end.    2 See Sura ii. 27. This is the title given by the Talmudists to the fifth of  the seven heavens.    3 This phrase is of constant recurrence in the Talmud. Maimonides, Yad Hach.  i. 3, makes it one of the positive commands of the Rabbins to believe \"that  there exists a first Being . . .    and that all things existing, Heaven and  Earth, and whatever is between them, exist only through the truth of his  existence.\"    4 Gabriel.

Downcast on that day shall be the countenances of some,    Travailing and worn,    Burnt at the scorching fire,    Made to drink from a fountain fiercely boiling.    No food shall they have but the fruit of Darih,1    Which shall not fatten, nor appease their hunger.    Joyous too, on that day, the countenances of others,    Well pleased with their labours past,    In a lofty garden:    No vain discourse shalt thou hear therein:    Therein shall be a gushing fountain,    Therein shall be raised couches,    And goblets ready placed,    And cushions laid in order,    And carpets spread forth.    Can they not look up to the clouds, how they are created;    And to the heaven how it is upraised;    And to the mountains how they are rooted;    And to the earth how it is outspread?    Warn thou then; for thou art a warner only:    Thou hast no authority over them:    But whoever shall turn back and disbelieve,    God shall punish him with the greater punishment.

Is there not in this an oath becoming a man of sense?    Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with Ad,    At Irem adorned with pillars,    Whose like have not been reared in these lands!    And with Themoud who hewed out the rocks in the valley;    And with Pharaoh the impaler;    Who all committed excesses in the lands,    And multiplied wickedness therein.    Wherefore thy Lord let loose on them the scourge of chastisement,2    For thy Lord standeth on a watch tower.    As to man, when his Lord trieth him and honoureth him and is bounteous to  him,    Then saith he, \"My Lord honoureth me:\"    But when he proveth him and limiteth his gifts to him,    He saith, \"My Lord despiseth me.\"    Aye. But ye honour not the orphan,    Nor urge ye one another to feed the poor,    And ye devour heritages, devouring greedily,    And ye love riches with exceeding love.    Aye. But when the earth shall be crushed with crushing, crushing,    And thy Lord shall come and the angels rank on rank,    And Hell on that day shall be moved up,3-Man shall on that day remember  himself. But how shall remembrance help him?    He shall say, Oh! would that I had prepared for this my life! On that day  none shall punish as God punisheth,    And none shall bind with such bonds as He.    Oh, thou soul which art at rest,    Return to thy Lord, pleased, and pleasing him:    Enter thou among my servants,    And enter thou my Paradise.      _______________________    1 Of the sacred month Dhu'lhajja.    2 Or, poured on them the mixed cup of chastisement.    3 The orthodox Muhammadans take this passage literally.

Thinketh man that we shall not re-unite his bones?    Aye! his very finger tips are we able evenly to replace.    But man chooseth to deny what is before him:    He asketh, \"When this day of Resurrection?\"    But when the eye shall be dazzled,    And when the moon shall be darkened,    And the sun and the moon shall be together,1    On that day man shall cry, \"Where is there a place to flee to?\"    But in vain-there is no refuge-    With thy Lord on that day shall be the sole asylum.    On that day shall man be told of all that he hath done first and last;    Yea, a man shall be the eye witness against himself:    And even if he put forth his plea. . . .2    (Move not thy tongue in haste to follow and master this revelation:3    For we will see to the collecting and the recital of it;    But when we have recited it, then follow thou the recital,    And, verily, afterwards it shall be ours to make it clear to thee.)    Aye, but ye love the transitory,    And ye neglect the life to come.    On that day shall faces beam with light,    Outlooking towards their Lord;    And faces on that day shall be dismal,    As if they thought that some great calamity would befal them.    Aye, when the soul shall come up into the throat,    And there shall be a cry, \"Who hath a charm that can restore him?\"    And the man feeleth that the time of his departure is come,    And when one leg shall be laid over the other,4    To thy Lord on that day shall he be driven on;    For he believed not, and he did not pray,    But he called the truth a lie and turned his back,    Then, walking with haughty men, rejoined his people.    That Hour is nearer to thee and nearer,5    It is ever nearer to thee and nearer still.    Thinketh man that he shall be left supreme?
