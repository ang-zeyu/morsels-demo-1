I had written to Charles Darwin telling him of my first, negative  results, those obtained by swinging the Bees in a box. He expected  a success and was much surprised at the failure. Had he had time to  experiment with his Pigeons, they would have behaved just like my Bees;  the preliminary twirling would not have affected them. The problem  called for another method; and what he proposed was this:    'To place the insect within an induction coil, so as to disturb any  magnetic or diamagnetic sensibility which it seems just possible that  they may possess.'    To treat an insect as you would a magnetic needle and to subject it to  the current from an induction coil in order to disturb its magnetism or  diamagnetism appeared to me, I must confess, a curious notion, worthy  of an imagination in the last ditch. I have but little confidence in our  physics, when they pretend to explain life; nevertheless, my respect for  the great man would have made me resort to the induction-coils, if I had  possessed the necessary apparatus. But my village boasts no scientific  resources: if I want an electric spark, I am reduced to rubbing a sheet  of paper on my knees. My physics cupboard contains a magnet; and that is  about all. When this penury was realised, another method was suggested,  simpler than the first and more certain in its results, as Darwin  himself considered:    'To make a very thin needle into a magnet; then breaking it into very  short pieces, which would still be magnetic, and fastening one of these  pieces with some cement on the thorax of the insects to be experimented  on. I believe that such a little magnet, from its close proximity to  the nervous system of the insect, would affect it more than would the  terrestrial currents.'    There is still the same idea of turning the insect into a sort of bar  magnet. The terrestrial currents guide it when returning to the nest. It  becomes a living compass which, withdrawn from the action of the earth  by the proximity of a loadstone, loses its sense of direction. With a  tiny magnet fastened on its thorax, parallel with the nervous system  and more powerful than the terrestrial magnetism by reason of its  comparative nearness, the insect will lose its bearings. Naturally, in  setting down these lines, I take shelter behind the mighty reputation  of the learned begetter of the idea. It would not be accepted as serious  coming from a humble person like myself. Obscurity cannot afford these  audacious theories.    The experiment seems easy; it is not beyond the means at my disposal.  Let us attempt it. I magnetise a very fine needle by rubbing it with my  bar magnet; I retain only the slenderest part, the point, some five or  six millimetres long. (.2 to.23 inch.--Translator's Note.) This broken  piece is a perfect magnet: it attracts and repels another magnetised  needle hanging from a thread. I am a little puzzled as to the best way  to fasten it on the insect's thorax. My assistant of the moment,  the pharmaceutical student, requisitions all the adhesives in his  laboratory. The best is a sort of cerecloth which he prepares specially  with a very fine material. It possesses the advantage that it can be  softened at the bowl of one's pipe when the time comes to operate out of  doors.    I cut out of this cerecloth a small square the size of the Bee's thorax;  and I insert the magnetised point through a few threads of the material.  All that we now have to do is to soften the gum a little and then dab  the thing at once on the Mason-bee's back, so that the broken needle  runs parallel with the spine. Other engines of the same kind are  prepared and due note taken of their poles, so as to enable me to point  the south pole at the insect's head in some cases and at the opposite  end in others.    My assistant and I begin by rehearsing the performance; we must have a  little practice before trying the experiment away from home. Besides, I  want to see how the insect will behave in its magnetic harness. I take a  Mason-bee at work in her cell, which I mark. I carry her to my study,  at the other end of the house. The magnetised outfit is fastened on the  thorax; and the insect is let go. The moment she is free, the Bee drops  to the ground and rolls about, like a mad thing, on the floor of the  room. She resumes her flight, flops down again, turns over on her side,  on her back, knocks against the things in her way, buzzes noisily,  flings herself about desperately and ends by darting through the open  window in headlong flight.    What does it all mean? The magnet appears to have a curious effect on my  patient's system! What a fuss she makes! How terrified she is! The Bee  seemed utterly distraught at losing her bearings under the influence of  my knavish tricks. Let us go to the nests and see what happens. We have  not long to wait: my insect returns, but rid of its magnetic tackle. I  recognize it by the traces of gum that still cling to the hair of the  thorax. It goes back to its cell and resumes its labours.    Always on my guard when searching the unknown, unwilling to draw  conclusions before weighing the arguments for and against, I feel doubt  creeping in upon me with regard to what I have seen. Was it really  the magnetic influence that disturbed my Bee so strangely? When she  struggled and kicked on the floor, fighting wildly with both legs and  wings, when she fled in terror, was she under the sway of the magnet  fastened on her back? Can my appliance have thwarted the guiding  influence of the terrestrial currents on her nervous system? Or was her  distress merely the result of an unwonted harness? This is what remains  to be seen and that without delay.    I construct a new apparatus, but provide it with a short straw in place  of the magnet. The insect carrying it on its back rolls on the ground,  kicks and flings herself about like the first, until the irksome  contrivance is removed, taking with it a part of the fur on the thorax.  The straw produces the same effects as the magnet, in other words,  magnetism had nothing to do with what happened. My invention, in both  cases alike, is a cumbrous tackle of which the Bee tries to rid herself  at once by every possible means. To look to her for normal actions so  long as she carries an apparatus, magnetized or not, upon her back is  the same as expecting to study the natural habits of a Dog after tying a  kettle to his tail.    The experiment with the magnet is impracticable. What would it tell us  if the insect consented to it? In my opinion, it would tell us nothing.  In the matter of the homing instinct, a magnet would have no more  influence than a bit of straw.        CHAPTER 5. THE STORY OF MY CATS.    If this swinging-process fails entirely when its object is to make the  insect lose its bearings, what influence can it have upon the Cat? Is  the method of whirling the animal round in a bag, to prevent its return,  worthy of confidence? I believed in it at first, so close-allied was it  to the hopeful idea suggested by the great Darwin. But my faith is now  shaken: my experience with the insect makes me doubtful of the Cat. If  the former returns after being whirled, why should not the latter? I  therefore embark upon fresh experiments.    And, first of all, to what extent does the Cat deserve his reputation of  being able to return to the beloved home, to the scenes of his amorous  exploits on the tiles and in the hay-lofts? The most curious facts are  told of his instinct; children's books on natural history abound with  feats that do the greatest credit to his prowess as a pilgrim. I do  not attach much importance to these stories: they come from casual  observers, uncritical folk given to exaggeration. It is not everybody  who can talk about animals correctly. When some one not of the craft  gets on the subject and says to me, 'Such or such an animal is black,' I  begin by finding out if it does not happen to be white; and many a time  the truth is discovered in the converse proposition. Men come to me and  sing the praises of the Cat as a travelling-expert. Well and good: we  will now look upon the Cat as a poor traveller. And that would be the  extent of my knowledge if I had only the evidence of books and of people  unaccustomed to the scruples of scientific examination. Fortunately,  I am acquainted with a few incidents that will stand the test of my  incredulity. The Cat really deserves his reputation as a discerning  pilgrim. Let us relate these incidents.    One day--it was at Avignon--there appeared upon the garden-wall a  wretched-looking Cat, with matted coat and protruding ribs, so thin  that his back was a mere jagged ridge. He was mewing with hunger. My  children, at that time very young, took pity on his misery. Bread  soaked in milk was offered him at the end of a reed. He took it. And the  mouthfuls succeeded one another to such good purpose that he was  sated and went off, heedless of the 'Puss! Puss!' of his compassionate  friends. Hunger returned; and the starveling reappeared in his wall-top  refectory. He received the same fare of bread soaked in milk, the same  soft words. He allowed himself to be tempted. He came down from the  wall. The children were able to stroke his back. Goodness, how thin he  was!    It was the great topic of conversation. We discussed it at table: we  would tame the vagabond, we would keep him, we would make him a bed  of hay. It was a most important matter: I can see to this day, I shall  always see the council of rattleheads deliberating on the Cat's fate.  They were not satisfied until the savage animal remained. Soon he grew  into a magnificent Tom. His large round head, his muscular legs, his  reddish fur,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2885"],[0,"The House of the Wolfings (#13)"],[1,"than  Thiodolf; and indeed so huge was his stature, that he seemed to be of the  kindred of the Mountain Giants; and his bodily might went with his  stature, so that no one man might deal with him body to body.  His face  was big; his cheek-bones high; his nose like an eagle's neb, his mouth  wide, his chin square and big; his eyes light-grey and fierce under  shaggy eyebrows: his hair white and long.    Such were his raiment and weapons, that he wore a coat of fence of dark  iron scales sewn on to horse-hide, and a dark iron helm fashioned above  his brow into the similitude of the Wolf's head with gaping jaws; and  this he had wrought for himself with his own hands, for he was a good  smith.  A round buckler he bore and a huge twibill, which no man of the  kindred could well wield save himself; and it was done both blade and  shaft with knots and runes in gold; and he loved that twibill well, and  called it the Wolf's Sister.    There then stood Heriulf, looking no less than one of the forefathers of  the kindred come back again to the battle of the Wolfings.    He was well-beloved for his wondrous might, and he was no hard man,  though so fell a warrior, and though of few words, as aforesaid, was a  blithe companion to old and young.  In numberless battles had he fought,  and men deemed it a wonder that Odin had not taken to him a man so much  after his own heart; and they said it was neighbourly done of the Father  of the Slain to forbear his company so long, and showed how well he loved  the Wolfing House.    For a good while yet came other bands of Markmen into the Thing-stead;  but at last there was an end of their coming.  Then the ring of men  opened, and ten warriors of the Daylings made their way through it, and  one of them, the oldest, bore in his hand the War-horn of the Daylings;  for this kindred had charge of the Thing-stead, and of all appertaining  to it.  So while his nine fellows stood round about the Speech-Hill, the  old warrior clomb up to the topmost of it, and blew a blast on the horn.  Thereon they who were sitting rose up, and they who were talking each to  each held their peace, and the whole ring drew nigher to the hill, so  that there was a clear space behind them 'twixt them and the wood, and a  space before them between them and the hill, wherein were those nine  warriors, and the horses for the burnt-offering, and the altar of the  Gods; and now were all well within ear-shot of a man speaking amidst the  silence in a clear voice.    But there were gathered of the Markmen to that place some four thousand  men, all chosen warriors and doughty men; and of the thralls and aliens  dwelling with them they were leading two thousand.  But not all of the  freemen of the Upper-mark could be at the Thing; for needs must there be  some guard to the passes of the wood toward the south and the hills of  the herdsmen, whereas it was no wise impassable to a wisely led host: so  five hundred men, what of freemen, what of thralls, abode there to guard  the wild-wood; and these looked to have some helping from the hill-men.    Now came an ancient warrior into the space between the men and the wild-  wood holding in his hand a kindled torch; and first he faced due south by  the sun, then, turning, he slowly paced the whole circle going from east  to west, and so on till he had reached the place he started from: then he  dashed the torch to the ground and quenched the fire, and so went his  ways to his own company again.    Then the old Dayling warrior on the mound-top drew his sword, and waved  it flashing in the sun toward the four quarters of the heavens; and  thereafter blew again a blast on the War-horn.  Then fell utter silence  on the whole assembly, and the wood was still around them, save here and  there the stamping of a war-horse or the sound of his tugging at the  woodland grass; for there was little resort of birds to the depths of the  thicket, and the summer morning was windless.          CHAPTER VIII--THE FOLK-MOTE OF THE MARKMEN      So the Dayling warrior lifted up his voice and said:       \"O kindreds of the Markmen, hearken the words I say;     For no chancehap assembly is gathered here to-day.     The fire hath gone around us in the hands of our very kin,     And twice the horn hath sounded, and the Thing is hallowed in.     Will ye hear or forbear to hearken the tale there is to tell?     There are many mouths to tell it, and a many know it well.     And the tale is this, that the foemen against our kindreds fare     Who eat the meadows desert, and burn the desert bare.\"    Then sat he down on the turf seat; but there arose a murmur in the  assembly as of men eager to hearken; and without more ado came a man out  of a company of the Upper-mark, and clomb up to the top of the Speech-  Hill, and spoke in a loud voice:    \"I am Bork, a man of the Geirings of the Upper-mark: two days ago I and  five others were in the wild-wood a-hunting, and we wended through the  thicket, and came into the land of the hill-folk; and after we had gone a  while we came to a long dale with a brook running through it, and yew-  trees scattered about it and a hazel copse at one end; and by the copse  was a band of men who had women and children with them, and a few neat,  and fewer horses; but sheep were feeding up and down the dale; and they  had made them booths of turf and boughs, and were making ready their  cooking fires, for it was evening.  So when they saw us, they ran to  their arms, but we cried out to them in the tongue of the Goths and bade  them peace.  Then they came up the bent to us and spake to us in the  Gothic tongue, albeit a little diversely from us; and when we had told  them what and whence we were, they were glad of us, and bade us to them,  and we went, and they entreated us kindly, and made us such cheer as they  might, and gave us mutton to eat, and we gave them venison of the wild-  wood which we had taken, and we abode with them there that night.    \"But they told us that they were a house of the folk of the herdsmen, and  that there was war in the land, and that the people thereof were fleeing  before the cruelty of a host of warriors, men of a mighty folk, such as  the earth hath not heard of, who dwell in great cities far to the south;  and how that this host had crossed the mountains, and the Great Water  that runneth from them, and had fallen upon their kindred, and overcome  their fighting-men, and burned their dwellings, slain their elders, and  driven their neat and their sheep, yea, and their women and children in  no better wise than their neat and sheep.    \"And they said that they had fled away thus far from their old  habitations, which were a long way to the south, and were now at point to  build them dwellings there in that Dale of the Hazels, and to trust to it  that these Welshmen, whom they called Romans, would not follow so far,  and that if they did, they might betake them to the wild-wood, and let  the thicket cover them, they being so nigh to it.    \"Thus they told us; wherefore we sent back one of our fellowship, Birsti  of the Geirings, to tell the tale; and one of the herdsmen folk went with  him, but we ourselves went onward to hear more of these Romans; for the  folk when we asked them, said that they had been in battle against them,  but had fled away for fear of their rumour only.  Therefore we went on,  and a young man of this kindred, who named themselves the Hrutings of the  Fell-folk, went along with us.  But the others were sore afeard, for all  they had weapons.    \"So as we went up the land we found they had told us the very sooth, and  we met divers Houses, and bands, and broken men, who were fleeing from  this trouble, and many of them poor and in misery, having lost their  flocks and herds as well as their roofs; and this last be but little loss  to them, as their dwellings are but poor, and for the most part they have  no tillage.  Now of these men, we met not a few who had been in battle  with the Roman host, and much they told us of their might not to be dealt  with, and their mishandling of those whom they took, both men and women;  and at the last we heard true tidings how they had raised them a garth,  and made a stronghold in the midst of the land, as men who meant abiding  there, so that neither might the winter drive them aback, and that they  might be succoured by their people on the other side of the Great River;  to which end they have made other garths, though not so great, on the  road to that water, and all these well and wisely warded by tried men.  For as to the Folks on the other side of the Water, all these lie under  their hand already, what by fraud what by force, and their warriors go  with them to the battle and help them; of whom we met bands now and  again, and fought with them, and took men of them, who told us all this  and much more, over long to tell of here.\"    He paused and turned about to look on the mighty assembly, and his ears  drank in the long murmur that followed his speaking, and when it had died  out he spake again, but in rhyme:       \"Lo thus much of my tidings!  But this too it behoveth to tell,     That these masterful men of the cities of the Markmen know full well:     And they wot of the well-grassed meadows, and the acres of the Mark,     And our life amidst of the wild-wood like a candle in the dark;     And they know of our young men's valour and our women's loveliness,     And our tree would they spoil with destruction if its fruit they may     never possess.     For their lust is without a limit, and nought may satiate     Their ravening maw; and their hunger if ye check it turneth to hate,     And the blood-fever burns in their bosoms, and torment and anguish and     woe     O'er the wide field ploughed by the sword-blade for the coming years     they sow;     And ruth is a thing forgotten and all hopes they trample down;     And whatso thing is steadfast, whatso of good"]]]
