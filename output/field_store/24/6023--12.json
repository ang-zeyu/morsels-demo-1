There is, as we shall hereafter  see, strong reason to believe that this wise, brave, wicked man, was  meditating a plan worthy of his fertile intellect and daring spirit, and  not less worthy of his deeply corrupted heart, a plan which, if it had  not been frustrated by strange means, would have ruined William without  benefiting James, and would have made the successful traitor master of  England and arbiter of Europe.    Thus things stood, when, in May 1691, William, after a short and busy  sojourn in England, set out again for the Continent, where the regular  campaign was about to open. He took with him Marlborough, whose  abilities he justly appreciated, and of whose recent negotiations with  Saint Germains he had not the faintest suspicion. At the Hague several  important military and political consultations were held; and, on every  occasion, the superiority of the accomplished Englishman was felt by  the most distinguished soldiers and statesmen of the United Provinces.  Heinsius, long after, used to relate a conversation which took place at  this time between William and the Prince of Vaudemont, one of the ablest  commanders in the Dutch service. Vaudemont spoke well of several  English officers, and among them of Talmash and Mackay, but pronounced  Marlborough superior beyond comparison to the rest. \"He has every  quality of a general. His very look shows it. He cannot fail to achieve  something great.\" \"I really believe, cousin,\" answered the King, \"that  my Lord will make good every thing that you have said of him.\"    There was still a short interval before the commencement of military  operations. William passed that interval in his beloved park at Loo.  Marlborough spent two or three days there, and was then despatched to  Flanders with orders to collect all the English forces, to form a camp  in the neighbourhood of Brussels, and to have every thing in readiness  for the King's arrival.    And now Marlborough had an opportunity of proving the sincerity of those  professions by which he had obtained from a heart, well described by  himself as harder than a marble chimneypiece, the pardon of an offence  such as might have moved even a gentle nature to deadly resentment. He  received from Saint Germains a message claiming the instant performance  of his promise to desert at the head of his troops. He was told that  this was the greatest service which he could render to the Crown. His  word was pledged; and the gracious master who had forgiven all past  errors confidently expected that it would be redeemed. The hypocrite  evaded the demand with characteristic dexterity. In the most respectful  and affectionate language he excused himself for not immediately obeying  the royal commands. The promise which he was required to fulfil had not  been quite correctly understood. There had been some misapprehension  on the part of the messengers. To carry over a regiment or two would  do more harm than good. To carry over a whole army was a business which  would require much time and management. [66] While James was murmuring  over these apologies, and wishing that he had not been quite so  placable, William arrived at the head quarters of the allied forces, and  took the chief command.    The military operations in Flanders recommenced early in June and  terminated at the close of September. No important action took place.  The two armies marched and countermarched, drew near and receded. During  some time they confronted each other with less than a league between  them. But neither William nor Luxemburg would fight except at an  advantage; and neither gave the other any advantage. Languid as the  campaign was, it is on one account remarkable. During more than a  century our country had sent no great force to make war by land out of  the British isles. Our aristocracy had therefore long ceased to be  a military class. The nobles of France, of Germany, of Holland, were  generally soldiers. It would probably have been difficult to find in the  brilliant circle which surrounded Lewis at Versailles a single Marquess  or Viscount of forty who had not been at some battle or siege. But the  immense majority of our peers, baronets and opulent esquires had never  served except in the trainbands, and had never borne a part in any  military exploit more serious than that of putting down a riot or of  keeping a street clear for a procession. The generation which had fought  at Edgehill and Lansdowne had nearly passed away. The wars of Charles  the Second had been almost entirely maritime. During his reign therefore  the sea service had been decidedly more the mode than the land service;  and, repeatedly, when our fleet sailed to encounter the Dutch, such  multitudes of men of fashion had gone on board that the parks and the  theatres had been left desolate. In 1691 at length, for the first time  since Henry the Eighth laid siege to Boulogne, an English army appeared  on the Continent under the command of an English king. A camp, which was  also a court, was irresistibly attractive to many young patricians  full of natural intrepidity, and ambitious of the favour which men  of distinguished bravery have always found in the eyes of women. To  volunteer for Flanders became the rage among the fine gentlemen who  combed their flowing wigs and exchanged their richly perfumed snuffs at  the Saint James's Coffeehouse. William's headquarters were enlivened  by a crowd of splendid equipages and by a rapid succession of sumptuous  banquets. For among the high born and high spirited youths who repaired  to his standard were some who, though quite willing to face a battery,  were not at all disposed to deny themselves the luxuries with which they  had been surrounded in Soho Square. In a few months Shadwell brought  these valiant fops and epicures on the stage. The town was made merry  with the character of a courageous but prodigal and effeminate coxcomb,  who is impatient to cross swords with the best men in the French  household troops, but who is much dejected by learning that he may find  it difficult to have his champagne iced daily during the summer. He  carries with him cooks, confectioners and laundresses, a waggonload of  plate, a wardrobe of laced and embroidered suits, and much rich tent  furniture, of which the patterns have been chosen by a committee of fine  ladies. [67]    While the hostile armies watched each other in Flanders, hostilities  were carried on with somewhat more vigour in other parts of Europe.  The French gained some advantages in Catalonia and in Piedmont. Their  Turkish allies, who in the east menaced the dominions of the Emperor,  were defeated by Lewis of Baden in a great battle. But nowhere were the  events of the summer so important as in Ireland.    From October 1690 till May 1691, no military operation on a large scale  was attempted in that kingdom. The area of the island was, during the  winter and spring, not unequally divided between the contending races.  The whole of Ulster, the greater part of Leinster and about one third  of Munster had submitted to the English. The whole of Connaught, the  greater part of Munster, and two or three counties of Leinster were held  by the Irish. The tortuous boundary formed by William's garrisons ran  in a north eastern direction from the bay of Castlehaven to Mallow, and  then, inclining still further eastward, proceeded to Cashel. From  Cashel the line went to Mullingar, from Mullingar to Longford, and from  Longford to Cavan, skirted Lough Erne on the west, and met the ocean  again at Ballyshannon. [68]    On the English side of this pale there was a rude and imperfect order.  Two Lords Justices, Coningsby and Porter, assisted by a Privy Council,  represented King William at Dublin Castle. Judges, Sheriffs and  Justices of the Peace had been appointed; and assizes were, after a long  interval, held in several county towns. The colonists had meanwhile  been formed into a strong militia, under the command of officers who had  commissions from the Crown. The trainbands of the capital consisted of  two thousand five hundred foot, two troops of horse and two troops  of dragoons, all Protestants and all well armed and clad. [69] On the  fourth of November, the anniversary of William's birth, and on the  fifth, the anniversary of his landing at Torbay, the whole of this force  appeared in all the pomp of war. The vanquished and disarmed natives  assisted, with suppressed grief and anger, at the triumph of the  caste which they had, five months before, oppressed and plundered with  impunity. The Lords Justices went in state to Saint Patrick's Cathedral;  bells were rung; bonfires were lighted; hogsheads of ale and claret were  set abroach in the streets; fireworks were exhibited on College Green; a  great company of nobles and public functionaries feasted at the Castle;  and, as the second course came up, the trumpets sounded, and Ulster King  at Arms proclaimed, in Latin, French and English, William and Mary, by  the grace of God, King and Queen of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.  [70]    Within the territory where the Saxon race was dominant, trade and  industry had already begun to revive. The brazen counters which bore the  image and superscription of James gave place to silver. The fugitives  who had taken refuge in England came back in multitudes; and, by their  intelligence, diligence and thrift, the devastation caused by two years  of confusion and robbery was soon in part repaired. Merchantmen heavily  laden were constantly passing and repassing Saint George's Channel.  The receipts of the custom houses on the eastern coast, from Cork to  Londonderry, amounted in six months to sixty-seven thousand five hundred  pounds, a sum such as would have been thought extraordinary even in the  most prosperous times. [71]    The Irish who remained within the English pale were, one and all,  hostile to the English domination. They were therefore "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26196"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 3, February, 1851 (#13)"],[1," and _permanent_.

WHITTIER has commenced in _The National Era_ the publication of a  new prose work, entitled \"My Summer with Dr. Singleterry.\" It will  probably be about as long as his admirable \"Leaves from Margaret Smith's  Journal,\" which appeared first in the same paper.           *       *       *       *       *    OF CHRISTMAS STORIES, the last season has been unusually prolific.  Thackeray published one called \"The Kickleburys upon the Rhine;\"  illustrated with fifteen of his own designs. Both the illustrations and  the story are liberally praised by the journals. The authoress of \"Mary  Barton\" published another, under the title of \"Moreland Cottage,\" not,  like her former work, a story of social wrong, but of gentle domestic  life. At the same time it is, if we may judge by extracts in the papers,  marked by the admirable peculiarities of her writing. There were some  dozen others, most of which were by less distinguished writers.           *       *       *       *       *    THE LIFE OF CALVIN, from the German of Henry, by the Rev.

We have  glanced over a few sheets of it, and are confident that if success  depends upon quality, it will prove one of the most successful books yet  published, upon a region which is illustrated by a larger amount of  literature than any other in the world. (Harpers, publishers.)           *       *       *       *       *    MR. PUTNAM has just published a third and very much improved edition of  his excellent work, \"The World's Progress.\" We have already expressed in  this magazine the opinion that \"The World's Progress\" is the most  interesting, valuable, and altogether indispensable manual of reference,  for the student or general reader, that has been published in this  country. It is a hand-book of facts, so perspicuously classified and  arranged, as to suit the necessities of persons of every degree of  intelligence, and so full, upon almost every sort of subjects, as to  serve the purposes of a universal manual. The new edition is augmented  by a supplement embracing the most recent statistics, etc.           *       *       *       *       *    THREE eminent scholars and authors, Dr. Lushington, Mr. Falconer, and  Dr. Twiss, are appointed by the British government, arbitrators to  determine the boundary between the provinces of Canada and Nova Scotia,  which has for some years been in dispute.           *       *       *       *       *    THE FOURTH VOLUME OF MR. HILDRETH'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, being  the first volume of the post-revolutionary history, will be published  immediately, we believe, by the Harpers. We look for an exceedingly  interesting book. Of the earlier volumes of the History, the London  _Spectator_ observes:--         \"The distinguishing literary characteristic of this history       is a careful succinctness. The convenience of a summary       notice of the gradual discovery of America, and the       necessity of singly narrating the foundation of each       separate colony, render any substantial novelty of plan in a       history of the United States impossible, except upon some       scheme where fitness should be sacrificed to fanciful       strangeness. Mr. Hildreth has judiciously refrained from       attempting any thing of the kind: but perhaps he has pushed       the mere chronological arrangement to an excess, and given       undue prominence to the discoveries and settlement of North       America by foreigners, in proportion to the scale of his       work. In the execution, Mr. Hildreth has carefully read and       as carefully digested his various authorities, and presented       the results of his studies succinctly, closely, and       comprehensively. In many cases the compendious style is apt       to fall into a vague generality, or the pith of the matter       is liable to be missed; but such is not the case with Mr.       Hildreth's. He states all that he sees, though he would see       more if he possessed a loftier and imaginative mind. We know       not his profession, but there is something lawyerlike in his       work. One subject seems the same to him as another: it is       not so much that he wants variety of power; as that he does       not seem to feel the variety in nature. His book is as much       a digest as a history. The parts in which Mr. Hildreth       succeeds best are those that relate to the social and       religious opinions and practices of the colonists. In fact,       it is as a social history that it possesses character and       value. The author's quiet unimpassioned style presents the       strange peculiarities that obtained among the New England       colonists till within little more than a generation of the       Revolutionary war, and some traces of which still remain.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"THE MEMORIAL, _written by friends of the late Mrs. Osgood_,\" to which  we have heretofore referred in these pages, is the most beautiful book  published in America during the season, and as an original literary  miscellany it surpasses any volume that ever appeared in the English  language. The _Albion_ says of it:         \"Seldom has a more graceful compliment been paid to the       memory of departed worth, than is exhibited in this handsome       volume, which is edited by Mrs. Mary E. Hewitt. It       originated at a chance meeting of a literary coterie, soon       after the death of the gifted and amiable woman in whose       honor it has been put together. When the conversation turned       upon the many claims which she possessed on the affections       and the esteem of those present, it was resolved that a       souvenir volume should be made up from their voluntary       contributions, and that the profits arising from the sale       should be devoted to erecting a monument over her grave, in       the Cemetery of Mount Auburn, near Boston. Many writers of       distinguished merit have engraved their names upon this       preparatory tablet, not all being numbered amongst her       friends and acquaintances, but all appreciating the many       virtues of the deceased lady, and the kindly motives of her       sorrowing friends. The table of contents shows indeed such a       list of names as should insure the speedy attainment of the       object in view. We can but mention half-a-dozen--Hawthorne,       Willis, G. P. R. James, the Bishop of Jamaica, John Neal,       Stoddard, Boker, G. P. Morris and Bayard Taylor, amongst the       men, and Miss Lynch, Mrs. Whitman, Mrs. Oaksmith, Mrs.       Sigourney, and the Editress to represent the sisterhood of       authorship. An admirable likeness of Mrs. Osgood, from a       portrait by her husband, serves as a frontispiece, and, with       some charming vignettes on steel and other illustrations,       enhances the value of this choice and creditable book.\"       (Putnam, publisher.)           *       *       *       *       *    FORTUNE-TELLING is as much in vogue as ever in Paris. A book, which is  said to have caused much observation, appeared there lately, which is  thus described in the correspondence of the London _Literary Gazette_:--         \"It consists of extracts from the voluminous writings of a       poor _gentilhomme_ of Brittany, during a period of upwards       of sixty years, and each extract is a prediction of some one       of the great political convulsions which have occurred in       this country during that time. Never was there a more       correct _Vates_; but Cassandra herself was not more       disregarded than he. The downfall and execution of Louis       XVI., the horrors of the Terror, the power and overthrow of       Napoleon, the revolution of 1830, and the republic of 1848,       were all predicted years before they came to pass; but the       poor prophet was set down as a madman by all his literary       contemporaries, and during his lifetime not a single       newspaper would consent to say any thing about his       predictions. What is the most singular thing of all is, that       he foretold (years ago, remember--when Louis Philippe was at       the height of his power), that the proclamation of the       republic would lead to the domination of a member of       Napoleon's family, and so it has; though if any one only six       months before Louis Napoleon's election had predicted the       same thing, he would certainly have been set down as a       lunatic. In consequence of this extraordinary foresight of       our prophet, people have looked with no little concern to       what he says for the future. And alas! they have met with       nothing very consolatory. We are, it seems, on the brink of       a fearful social crisis, the consequence of which will be       the complete destruction of European society as at present       constituted; and "]]]
