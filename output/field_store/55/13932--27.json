The children heard boots go out and  down the steps. The cab drove away, and the front door shut. Then Mother  came in. Her dear face was as white as her lace collar, and her eyes  looked very big and shining. Her mouth looked like just a line of pale  red--her lips were thin and not their proper shape at all.    \"It's bedtime,\" she said. \"Ruth will put you to bed.\"    \"But you promised we should sit up late tonight because Father's come  home,\" said Phyllis.    \"Father's been called away--on business,\" said Mother. \"Come, darlings,  go at once.\"    They kissed her and went. Roberta lingered to give Mother an extra hug  and to whisper:    \"It wasn't bad news, Mammy, was it? Is anyone dead--or--\"    \"Nobody's dead--no,\" said Mother, and she almost seemed to push Roberta  away. \"I can't tell you anything tonight, my pet. Go, dear, go NOW.\"    So Roberta went.    Ruth brushed the girls' hair and helped them to undress. (Mother almost  always did this herself.) When she had turned down the gas and left them  she found Peter, still dressed, waiting on the stairs.    \"I say, Ruth, what's up?\" he asked.    \"Don't ask me no questions and I won't tell you no lies,\" the red-headed  Ruth replied. \"You'll know soon enough.\"    Late that night Mother came up and kissed all three children as they  lay asleep. But Roberta was the only one whom the kiss woke, and she lay  mousey-still, and said nothing.    \"If Mother doesn't want us to know she's been crying,\" she said to  herself as she heard through the dark the catching of her Mother's  breath, \"we WON'T know it. That's all.\"    When they came down to breakfast the next morning, Mother had already  gone out.    \"To London,\" Ruth said, and left them to their breakfast.    \"There's something awful the matter,\" said Peter, breaking his egg.  \"Ruth told me last night we should know soon enough.\"    \"Did you ASK her?\" said Roberta, with scorn.    \"Yes, I did!\" said Peter, angrily. \"If you could go to bed without  caring whether Mother was worried or not, I couldn't. So there.\"    \"I don't think we ought to ask the servants things Mother doesn't tell  us,\" said Roberta.    \"That's right, Miss Goody-goody,\" said Peter, \"preach away.\"    \"I'M not goody,\" said Phyllis, \"but I think Bobbie's right this time.\"    \"Of course. She always is. In her own opinion,\" said Peter.    \"Oh, DON'T!\" cried Roberta, putting down her egg-spoon; \"don't let's be  horrid to each other. I'm sure some dire calamity is happening. Don't  let's make it worse!\"    \"Who began, I should like to know?\" said Peter.    Roberta made an effort, and answered:--    \"I did, I suppose, but--\"    \"Well, then,\" said Peter, triumphantly. But before he went to school he  thumped his sister between the shoulders and told her to cheer up.    The children came home to one o'clock dinner, but Mother was not there.  And she was not there at tea-time.    It was nearly seven before she came in, looking so ill and tired that  the children felt they could not ask her any questions. She sank into an  arm-chair. Phyllis took the long pins out of her hat, while Roberta took  off her gloves, and Peter unfastened her walking-shoes and fetched her  soft velvety slippers for her.    When she had had a cup of tea, and Roberta had put eau-de-Cologne on her  poor head that ached, Mother said:--    \"Now, my darlings, I want to tell you something. Those men last night  did bring very bad news, and Father will be away for some time. I am  very worried about it, and I want you all to help me, and not to make  things harder for me.\"    \"As if we would!\" said Roberta, holding Mother's hand against her face.    \"You can help me very much,\" said Mother, \"by being good and happy  and not quarrelling when I'm away\"--Roberta and Peter exchanged guilty  glances--\"for I shall have to be away a good deal.\"    \"We won't quarrel. Indeed we won't,\" said everybody. And meant it, too.    \"Then,\" Mother went on, \"I want you not to ask me any questions about  this trouble; and not to ask anybody else any questions.\"    Peter cringed and shuffled his boots on the carpet.    \"You'll promise this, too, won't you?\" said Mother.    \"I did ask Ruth,\" said Peter, suddenly. \"I'm very sorry, but I did.\"    \"And what did she say?\"    \"She said I should know soon enough.\"    \"It isn't necessary for you to know anything about it,\" said Mother;  \"it's about business, and you never do understand business, do you?\"    \"No,\" said Roberta; \"is it something to do with Government?\" For Father  was in a Government Office.    \"Yes,\" said Mother. \"Now it's bed-time, my darlings. And don't YOU  worry. It'll all come right in the end.\"    \"Then don't YOU worry either, Mother,\" said Phyllis, \"and we'll all be  as good as gold.\"    Mother sighed and kissed them.    \"We'll begin being good the first thing tomorrow morning,\" said Peter,  as they went upstairs.    \"Why not NOW?\" said Roberta.    \"There's nothing to be good ABOUT now, silly,\" said Peter.    \"We might begin to try to FEEL good,\" said Phyllis, \"and not call  names.\"    \"Who's calling names?\" said Peter. \"Bobbie knows right enough that when  I say 'silly', it's just the same as if I said Bobbie.\"    \"WELL,\" said Roberta.    \"No, I don't mean what you mean. I mean it's just a--what is it Father  calls it?--a germ of endearment! Good night.\"    The girls folded up their clothes with more than usual neatness--which  was the only way of being good that they could think of.    \"I say,\" said Phyllis, smoothing out her pinafore, \"you used to say  it was so dull--nothing happening, like in books. Now something HAS  happened.\"    \"I never wanted things to happen to make Mother unhappy,\" said Roberta.  \"Everything's perfectly horrid.\"    Everything continued to be perfectly horrid for some weeks.    Mother was nearly always out. Meals were dull and dirty. The  between-maid was sent away, and Aunt Emma came on a visit. Aunt Emma was  much older than Mother. She was going abroad to be a governess. She  was very busy getting her clothes ready, and they were very ugly, dingy  clothes, and she had them always littering about, and the sewing-machine  seemed to whir--on and on all day and most of the night. Aunt Emma  believed in keeping children in their proper places. And they more than  returned the compliment. Their idea of Aunt Emma's proper place was  anywhere where they were not. So they saw very little of her. They  preferred the company of the servants, who were more amusing. Cook,  if in a good temper, could sing comic songs, and the housemaid, if she  happened not to be offended with you, could imitate a hen that has laid  an egg, a bottle of champagne being opened, and could mew like two cats  fighting. The servants never told the children what the bad news was  that the gentlemen had brought to Father. But they kept hinting  that they could tell a great deal if they chose--and this was not  comfortable.    One day when Peter had made a booby trap over the bath-room door, and  it had acted beautifully as Ruth passed through, that red-haired  parlour-maid caught him and boxed his ears.    \"You'll come to a bad end,\" she said furiously, \"you nasty little limb,  you! If you don't mend your ways, you'll go where your precious Father's  gone, so I tell you straight!\"    Roberta repeated this to her Mother, and next day Ruth was sent away.    Then came the time when Mother came home and went to bed and stayed  there two days and the Doctor came, and the children crept wretchedly  about the house and wondered if the world was coming to an end.    Mother came down one morning to breakfast, very pale and with lines  on her face that used not to be there. And she smiled, as well as she  could, and said:--    \"Now, my pets, everything is settled. We're going to leave this house,  and go and live in the country. Such a ducky dear little white house. I  know you'll love it.\"    A whirling week of packing followed--not just packing clothes, like when  you go to the seaside, but packing chairs and tables, covering their  tops with sacking and their legs with straw.    All sorts of things were packed that you don't pack when you go to  the seaside. Crockery, blankets, candlesticks, carpets, bedsteads,  saucepans, and even fenders and fire-irons.    The house was like a furniture warehouse. I think the children enjoyed  it very much. Mother was very busy, but not too busy now to talk to  them, and read to them, and even to make a bit of poetry for Phyllis to  cheer her up when she fell down with a screwdriver and ran it into her  hand.    \"Aren't you going to pack this, Mother?\" Roberta asked, pointing to the  beautiful cabinet inlaid with red turtleshell and brass.    \"We can't take everything,\" said Mother.    \"But we seem to be taking all the ugly things,\" said Roberta.    \"We're taking the useful ones,\" said Mother; \"we've got to play at being  Poor for a bit, my chickabiddy.\"    When all the ugly useful things had been packed up and taken away in a  van by men in green-baize aprons, the two girls and Mother and Aunt Emma  slept in the two spare rooms where the furniture was all pretty. All  their beds had gone. A bed was made up for Peter on the drawing-room  sofa.    \"I say, this is larks,\" he said, wriggling joyously, as Mother tucked  him up. \"I do like moving! I wish we moved once a month.\"    Mother laughed.    \"I don't!\" she said. \"Good night, Peterkin.\"    As she turned away Roberta saw her face. She never forgot it.    \"Oh, Mother,\" she whispered all to herself as she got into bed, \"how  brave you are! How I love you! Fancy being brave enough to laugh when  you're feeling like THAT!\"    Next day boxes were filled, and boxes and more boxes; and then late in  the afternoon a cab came to take them to the station.    Aunt Emma saw them off. They felt that THEY were seeing HER off, and  they were glad of it.    \"But, oh, those poor"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18751"],[0,"A Text-book of Assaying: For the Use of Those Connected with Mines.
