Paul  declares that the false apostles were called or sent neither by men, nor  by man. The most they could claim is that they were sent by others. \"But  as for me I was called neither of men, nor by man, but directly by Jesus  Christ. My call is in every respect like the call of the apostles. In  fact I am an apostle.\"    Elsewhere Paul draws a sharp distinction between an apostleship and  lesser functions, as in I Corinthians 12:28: \"And God hath set some in  the church; first, apostles; secondarily, prophets; thirdly, teachers.\"  He mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by  God.    Matthias was called in this manner. The apostles chose two candidates  and then cast lots, praying that God would indicate which one He would  have. To be an apostle he had to have his appointment from God. In the  same manner Paul was called as the apostle of the Gentiles.    The call is not to be taken lightly. For a person to possess knowledge  is not enough. He must be sure that he is properly called. Those who  operate without a proper call seek no good purpose. God does not bless  their labors. They may be good preachers, but they do not edify. Many of  the fanatics of our day pronounce words of faith, but they bear no good  fruit, because their purpose is to turn men to their perverse opinions.  On the other hand, those who have a divine call must suffer a good  deal of opposition in order that they may become fortified against the  running attacks of the devil and the world.    This is our comfort in the ministry, that ours is a divine office to  which we have been divinely called. Reversely, what an awful thing it  must be for the conscience if one is not properly called. It spoils  one's best work. When I was a young man I thought Paul was making too  much of his call. I did not understand his purpose. I did not then  realize the importance of the ministry. I knew nothing of the doctrine  of faith because we were taught sophistry instead of certainty, and  nobody understood spiritual boasting. We exalt our calling, not to gain  glory among men, or money, or satisfaction, or favor, but because people  need to be assured that the words we speak are the words of God. This is  no sinful pride. It is holy pride.      VERSE 1. And God the Father, who raised him from the dead.    Paul is so eager to come to the subject matter of his epistle, the  righteousness of faith in opposition to the righteousness of works, that  already in the title he must speak his mind. He did not think it quite  enough to say that he was an apostle \"by Jesus Christ\"; he adds, \"and  God the Father, who raised him from the dead.\"    The clause seems superfluous on first sight. Yet Paul had a good reason  for adding it. He had to deal with Satan and his agents who endeavored  to deprive him of the righteousness of Christ, who was raised by God the  Father from the dead. These perverters of the righteousness of Christ  resist the Father and the Son, and the works of them both.    In this whole epistle Paul treats of the resurrection of Christ. By His  resurrection Christ won the victory over law, sin, flesh, world, devil,  death, hell, and every evil. And this His victory He donated unto us.  These many tyrants and enemies of ours may accuse and frighten us, but  they dare not condemn us, for Christ, whom God the Father has raised  from the dead is our righteousness and our victory.    Do you notice how well suited to his purpose Paul writes? He does not  say, \"By God who made heaven and earth, who is Lord of the angels,\" but  Paul has in mind the righteousness of Christ, and speaks to the point,  saying, \"I am an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus  Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.\"        VERSE 2. And all the brethren which are with me.    This should go far in shutting the mouths of the false apostles. Paul's  intention is to exalt his own ministry while discrediting theirs. He  adds for good measure the argument that he does not stand alone, but  that all the brethren with him attest to the fact that his doctrine  is divinely true. \"Although the brethren with me are not apostles like  myself, yet they are all of one mind with me, think, write, and teach as  I do.\"        VERSE 2. Unto the churches of Galatia.    Paul had preached the Gospel throughout Galatia, founding many churches  which after his departure were invaded by the false apostles. The  Anabaptists in our time imitate the false apostles. They do not go where  the enemies of the Gospel predominate. They go where the Christians are.  Why do they not invade the Catholic provinces and preach their doctrine  to godless princes, bishops, and doctors, as we have done by the help of  God? These soft martyrs take no chances. They go where the Gospel has  a hold, so that they may not endanger their lives. The false apostles  would not go to Jerusalem of Caiaphas, or to the Rome of the Emperor,  or to any other place where no man had preached before as Paul and the  other apostles did. But they came to the churches of Galatia, knowing  that where men profess the name of Christ they may feel secure.    It is the lot of God's ministers not only to suffer opposition at the  hand of a wicked world, but also to see the patient indoctrination of  many years quickly undone by such religious fanatics. This hurts more  than the persecution of tyrants. We are treated shabbily on the outside  by tyrants, on the inside by those whom we have restored to the liberty  of the Gospel, and also by false brethren. But this is our comfort and  our glory, that being called of God we have the promise of everlasting  life. We look for that reward which \"eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,  neither hath entered into the heart of man.\"    Jerome raises the question why Paul called them churches that were no  churches, inasmuch as the Galatians had forsaken the grace of Christ  for the law of Moses. The proper answer is: Although the Galatians had  fallen away from the doctrine of Paul, baptism, the Gospel, and the  name of Christ continued among them. Not all the Galatians had become  perverted. There were some who clung to the right view of the Word and  the Sacraments. These means cannot be contaminated. They remain divine  regardless of men's opinion. Wherever the means of grace are found,  there is the Holy Church, even though Antichrist reigns there. So much  for the title of the epistle. Now follows the greeting of the apostle.        VERSE 3. Grace be to you, and peace, from God the Father, and from our    Lord Jesus Christ.    The terms of grace and peace are common terms with Paul and are now  pretty well understood. But since we are explaining this epistle, you  will not mind if we repeat what we have so often explained elsewhere.  The article of justification must be sounded in our ears incessantly  because the frailty of our flesh will not permit us to take hold of it  perfectly and to believe it with all our heart.    The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing. Grace remits sin, and peace  quiets the conscience. Sin and conscience torment us, but Christ has  overcome these fiends now and forever. Only Christians possess this  victorious knowledge given from above. These two terms, grace and peace,  constitute Christianity. Grace involves the remission of sins, peace,  and a happy conscience. Sin is not canceled by lawful living, for no  person is able to live up to the Law. The Law reveals guilt, fills the  conscience with terror, and drives men to despair. Much less is sin  taken away by man-invented endeavors. The fact is, the more a person  seeks credit for himself by his own efforts, the deeper he goes into  debt. Nothing can take away sin except the grace of God. In actual  living, however, it is not so easy to persuade oneself that by grace  alone, in opposition to every other means, we obtain the forgiveness of  our sins and peace with God.    The world brands this a pernicious doctrine. The world advances free  will, the rational and natural approach of good works, as the means of  obtaining the forgiveness of sin. But it is impossible to gain peace  of conscience by the methods and means of the world. Experience proves  this. Various holy orders have been launched for the purpose of securing  peace of conscience through religious exercises, but they proved  failures because such devices only increase doubt and despair. We find  no rest for our weary bones unless we cling to the word of grace.    The Apostle does not wish the Galatians grace and peace from the  emperor, or from kings, or from governors, but from God the Father. He  wishes them heavenly peace, the kind of which Jesus spoke when He  said, \"Peace I leave unto you: my peace I give unto you.\" Worldly peace  provides quiet enjoyment of life and possessions. But in affliction,  particularly in the hour of death, the grace and peace of the world will  not deliver us. However, the grace and peace of God will. They make a  person strong and courageous to bear and to overcome all difficulties,  even death itself, because we have the victory of Christ's death and the  assurance of the forgiveness of our sins.                  Men Should Not Speculate About the Nature of God    The Apostle adds to the salutation the words, \"and from our Lord Jesus  Christ.\" Was it not enough to say, \"from God the Father\"?    It is a principle of the Bible that we are not to inquire curiously into  the nature of God. \"There shall no man see me, and live,\" Exodus 33:20.  All who trust in their own merits to save them disregard this principle  and lose sight of the Mediator, Jesus Christ.    True Christian theology does not inquire into the nature of God, but  into God's purpose and will in Christ, whom God incorporated in our  flesh to live and to die for our sins. There is nothing more dangerous  than to speculate about the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15535"],[0,"Violin Mastery: Talks with Master Violinists and Teachers (#2)"],[1,"ncertos, a  great variety of fine modern works has appeared, the appreciation of  chamber-music has grown and developed, and with it that of the sonata.  And the modern violin sonata is also a vehicle for violin virtuosity in  the very best meaning of the word. The sonatas of Cesar Franck, d'Indy,  Theodore Dubois, Lekeu, Vierne, Ropartz, Lazarri--they are all highly  expressive, yet at the same time virtuose. The violin parts develop a  lovely song line, yet their technic is far from simple. Take Lekeu's  splendid Sonata in G major; rugged and massive, making decided technical  demands--it yet has a wonderful breadth of melody, a great expressive  quality of song.\"    These works--those who have heard the Master play the beautiful Lazarri  sonata this season will not soon forget it--are all dedicated to Ysaye.  And this holds good, too, of the Cesar Franck sonata. As Ysaye says:  \"Performances of these great sonatas call for _two_ artists--for their  piano parts are sometimes very elaborate. Cesar Franck sent me his  sonata on September 26, 1886, my wedding day--it was his wedding  present! I cannot complain as regards the number of works, really  important works, inscribed to me. There are so many--by Chausson (his  symphony), Ropartz, Dubois (his sonata--one of the best after Franck),  d'Indy (the _Istar_ variations and other works), Gabriel Faure (the  Quintet), Debussy (the Quartet)! There are more than I can recall at  the moment--violin sonatas, symphonic music, chamber-music, choral  works, compositions of every kind!    \"Debussy, as you know, wrote practically nothing originally for the  violin and piano--with the exception, perhaps, of a work published by  Durand during his last illness. Yet he came very near writing something  for me. Fifteen years ago he told me he was composing a 'Nocturne' for  me. I went off on a concert tour and was away a long time. When I  returned to Paris I wrote to Debussy to find out what had become of my  'Nocturne.' And he replied that, somehow, it had shaped itself up for  orchestra instead of a violin solo. It is one of the _Trois Nocturnes_  for orchestra. Perhaps one reason why so much has been inscribed to me  is the fact that as an interpreting artist, I have never cultivated a  'specialty.' I have played everything from Bach to Debussy, for real art  should be international!\"    Ysaye himself has an almost marvelous right-arm and fingerboard control,  which enables him to produce at will the finest and most subtle tonal  nuances in all bowings. Then, too, he overcomes the most intricate  mechanical problems with seemingly effortless ease. And his tone has  well been called \"golden.\" His own definition of tone is worth  recording. He says it should be \"In music what the heart suggests, and  the soul expresses!\"                            THE TOOLS OF VIOLIN MASTERY    \"With regard to mechanism,\" Ysaye continued, \"at the present day the  tools of violin mastery, of expression, technic, mechanism, are far more  necessary than in days gone by. In fact they are indispensable, if the  spirit is to express itself without restraint. And the greater  mechanical command one has the less noticeable it becomes. All that  suggests effort, awkwardness, difficulty, repels the listener, who more  than anything else delights in a singing violin tone. Vieuxtemps often  said: _Pas de trait pour le trait--chantez, chantez_! (Not runs for the  sake of runs--sing, sing!)    \"Too many of the technicians of the present day no longer sing. Their  difficulties--they surmount them more or less happily; but the effect is  too apparent, and though, at times, the listener may be astonished, he  can never be charmed. Agile fingers, sure of themselves, and a perfect  bow stroke are essentials; and they must be supremely able to carry  along the rhythm and poetic action the artist desires. Mechanism  becomes, if anything, more accessible in proportion as its domain is  enriched by new formulas. The violinist of to-day commands far greater  technical resources than did his predecessors. Paganini is accessible to  nearly all players: Vieuxtemps no longer offers the difficulties he did  thirty years ago. Yet the wood-wind, brass and even the string  instruments subsist in a measure on the heritage transmitted by the  masters of the past. I often feel that violin teaching to-day endeavors  to develop the esthetic sense at too early a stage. And in devoting  itself to the _head_ it forgets the _hands_, with the result that the  young soldiers of the violinistic army, full of ardor and courage, are  ill equipped for the great battle of art.    \"In this connection there exists an excellent set of _Etudes-Caprices_  by E. Chaumont, which offer the advanced student new elements and  formulas of development. Though in some of them 'the frame is too large  for the picture,' and though difficult from a violinistic point of view,  'they lie admirably well up the neck,' to use one of Vieuxtemps's  expressions, and I take pleasure in calling attention to them.    \"When I said that the string instruments, including the violin, subsist  in a measure on the heritage transmitted by the masters of the past, I  spoke with special regard to technic. Since Vieuxtemps there has been  hardly one new passage written for the violin; and this has retarded the  development of its technic. In the case of the piano, men like Godowsky  have created a new technic for their instrument; but although  Saint-Saens, Bruch, Lalo and others have in their works endowed the  violin with much beautiful music, music itself was their first concern,  and not music for the violin. There are no more concertos written for  the solo flute, trombone, etc.--as a result there is no new technical  material added to the resources of these instruments.    \"In a way the same holds good of the violin--new works conceived only  from the musical point of view bring about the stagnation of technical  discovery, the invention of new passages, of novel harmonic wealth of  combination is not encouraged. And a violinist owes it to himself to  exploit the great possibilities of his own instrument. I have tried to  find new technical ways and means of expression in my own compositions.  For example, I have written a _Divertiment_ for violin and orchestra in  which I believe I have embodied new thoughts and ideas, and have  attempted to give violin technic a broader scope of life and vigor.    \"In the days of Viotti and Rode the harmonic possibilities were more  limited--they had only a few chords, and hardly any chords of the ninth.  But now harmonic material for the development of a new violin technic is  there: I have some violin studies, in ms., which I may publish some day,  devoted to that end. I am always somewhat hesitant about  publishing--there are many things I might publish, but I have seen so  much brought out that was banal, poor, unworthy, that I have always been  inclined to mistrust the value of my own creations rather than fall into  the same error. We have the scale of Debussy and his successors to draw  upon, their new chords and successions of fourths and fifths--for new  technical formulas are always evolved out of and follow after new  harmonic discoveries--though there is as yet no violin method which  gives a fingering for the whole-tone scale. Perhaps we will have to wait  until Kreisler or I will have written one which makes plain the new  flowering of technical beauty and esthetic development which it brings  the violin.    \"As to teaching violin, I have never taught violin in the generally  accepted sense of the phrase. But at Godinne, where I usually spent my  summers when in Europe, I gave a kind of traditional course in the works  of Vieuxtemps, Wieniawski and other masters to some forty or fifty  artist-students who would gather there--the same course I look forward  to giving in Cincinnati, to a master class of very advanced pupils. This  was and will be a labor of love, for the compositions of Vieuxtemps and  Wieniawski especially are so inspiring and yet, as a rule, they are so  badly played--without grandeur or beauty, with no thought of the  traditional interpretation--that they seem the piecework of technic  factories!                                    VIOLIN MASTERY    \"When I take the whole history of the violin into account I feel that  the true inwardness of 'Violin Mastery' is best expressed by a kind of  threefold group of great artists. First, in the order of romantic  expression, we have a trinity made up of Corelli, Viotti and Vieuxtemps.  Then there is a trinity of mechanical perfection, composed of Locatelli,  Tartini and Paganini or, a more modern equivalent, Cesar Thomson,  Kubelik and Burmeister. And, finally, what I might call in the order of  lyric expression, a quartet comprising Ysaye, Thibaud, Mischa Elman and  Sametini of Chicago, the last-named a wonderfully fine artist of the  lyric or singing type. Of course there are qualifications to be made.  Locatelli was not altogether an exponent of technic. And many other fine  artists besides those mentioned share the characteristics of those in  the various groups. Yet, speaking in a general way, I believe that these  groups of attainment might be said to sum up what 'Violin Mastery'  really is. And a violin master? He must be a violinist, a thinker, a  poet, a human being, he must have known hope, love, passion and despair,  he must have run the gamut of the emotions in order to express them all  in his playing. He must play his violin as Pan played his flute!\"    In conclusion Ysaye sounded a note of warning for the too ambitious  young student and player. \"If Art is to progress, the technical and  mechanical element must not, of course, be neglected. But a boy of  eighteen cannot expect to express that to which the serious student of  thirty, the man who has actually lived, can give voice. If the  violinist's art is truly a great art, it cannot come to"]]]
