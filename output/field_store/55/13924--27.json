I begin at length to consider myself as it were at home in this singular  country of Aheer--without, however, experiencing any desire to dally  here longer than the force of circumstances absolutely requires. It must  be confessed, as I have already hinted, that the town of Tintalous,[1]  in front of which we are encamped, does not at all answer the idea which  our too active imagination had formed. Yet it is a singular place. It is  situated on rocky ground, at the bend of a broad valley, which in the  rainy season becomes often-times the bed of a temporary river. Here and  there around it are scattered numerous trees, many of considerable size,  giving the surface of the valley something of a park-like appearance.  The herbage is not rich, but it is ornamental, and refreshes the eye in  contrast with the black, naked rocks, which rise on all hands to the  height often of two or three thousand feet. To the east, it is true, the  country is a little open; and between the mountains run in numerous  white sandy wadys, sprinkled with fresh green plants, or shaded by  various species of mimosa and other spreading trees, under which the  shepherds and herdsmen find shelter from the sun.      [1] Tintalous is 40 short and 30 long days from Ghat, N.N.E.;        60 short and 50 long from Mourzuk, N.E.; 20 short, 15 long,        from Zinder or Damerghou, S.S.W.; 7 long, 10 or 12 short,        from Bilma, E.; 38 to 45 days from Tuat, N.W. (_via_        Taghajeet). Maharees, of course, trot and gallop in half        the time. These are native statements.    The principal feature of Tintalous itself is what may be called the  palace of En-Noor. It is, indeed, one, compared with the huts and stone  hovels amidst which it is placed. The materials are stone plastered with  mud, and also the wood of the mimosa tree. The form is an oblong square,  one story high, with an interior courtyard, and various appendages and  huts around on the outside. There is another house, and also a mosque  built in the same style, but much smaller. Of the rest of the  habitations, a few are stone sheds, but the greater part are huts made  of the dry stalks of the fine herb called bou rekabah, in the form of a  conical English haystack, and are very snug, impervious alike to rain  and sun. There are not more than one hundred and fifty of these huts and  sheds, scattered over a considerable space, without any order; some are  placed two or three together within a small enclosure, which serves as a  court or yard, in which visitors are received and cooking is carried on.  There is another little village at a stone's-throw north. The  inhabitants of these two villages consist entirely of the slaves and  dependants of En-Noor.    All around Tintalous, within an hour or two hours' ride, there are  villages or towns of precisely the same description, more or less  numerously peopled. At Seloufeeat and Tintaghoda, however, we saw more  houses built of stone and mud. This may be accounted for by the fact  that the inhabitants are not nearly so migratory as those of Tintalous,  who often follow in a body the motions of their master, so that he is  ever surrounded by an imposing household.    I must not omit mentioning an important article of furniture which is to  be observed in all the houses of Aheer--namely, the bedstead. Whilst  most of the inhabitants of Fezzan lie upon skins or mats upon the  ground, the Kailouees have a nice light palm-branch bedstead, which  enables them to escape the damp of the rainy season, and the attack of  dangerous insects and reptiles like the scorpion and the lefa.    I shall hereafter make a few observations on the tribes inhabiting  Aheer. Here I will note that they are all called Targhee, that is  Tuarick, by the traders of the north; and that the predominant race is  the Kailouee. To me the latter seems to be a mixture of the Berbers, or  supposed aborigines of the northern coast, with all the tribes and  varieties of tribes of the interior of Africa. This may account for  their having less pride and stiffness than the Tuaricks of Ghat, who are  purer Berbers; as well as for their disposition to thieving and petty  larceny, of which I have recently been obliged to give some examples.  The pure Berbers, likewise, are much less sensual than their bastard  descendants, who seem, indeed, to have no idea of pleasure but in its  grossest shape.    The Kailouees are, for the most part, tall and active, little encumbered  by bulky bodies; some having both complexion and features nearly  European. At any rate there are many as fair-looking as the Arabs  generally, whilst others are quite negro in colour. The women are  smaller and stouter; some are fattened like the Mooresses of the coast,  and attain to an enormous degree of _embon-point_. They are not  ill-looking, but offer nothing remarkable in their forms.    I have already set down many particulars of manners, and shall proceed  to do so in the same disjointed way. At a future time all these traits  must be collected to form one picture.[2] For the present I am anxious  about the future progress of the Mission, and impatient, at any rate, to  hear some news of our advance. We cannot do all the things we would. Our  position is almost that of prisoners. We must depend entirely on the  caprice of En-Noor, who, however, may already have laid out his plans  distinctly, though he does not choose to communicate them to us.      [2] Perhaps the note-books of Mr. Richardson, in which facts        are set down fresh and distinct just as they presented        themselves, will be found to be more interesting than an        elaborate narrative. At any rate it has seemed better not        to attempt to do what was left undone in this matter.--ED.    _Oct. 2d._--We have been lately discussing the practicability of going  to Sakkatou, on a visit to the Sultan Bello; and this morning I looked  over, for the first time, some \"letters of credit\" which Mr. Gagliuffi,  our plausible consul at Mourzuk, had given me. I found that the amount  offered for the use of the expedition in Kanou does not exceed a hundred  and fifty reals of Fezzan, or about twenty pounds sterling, and that the  agent is expressly requested not to advance any more! This extraordinary  document induced me to look further, and it soon appeared that the  documents on which I relied so much were mere delusions. The wording of  the Arabic letter to Bornou was ambiguous; but in as far as I and my  interpreter could make it out, Haj Bashaw, to whom it is addressed, was  requested, if he had any money of Mr. Gagliuffi's in hand, to give me _a  little_! I really did not expect that a person in whom I had placed so  much confidence would play me this trick. But it seems that Levantines  are and will be Levantines to the end of time. I have written to  Government, complaining of this unworthy conduct.    _3d._--Dr. Barth is about to take advantage of the delay necessarily  incurred at Tintalous to visit Aghadez, the real capital of Aheer, to  which the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18556"],[0,"Catalogue of Violent and Destructive Earthquakes in the Philippines (#2)"],[1,"has been preserved for posterity,  but whether the phenomenon occurred during February or March, the  records leave undecided. In the third column will be found, in the  first place, the intensity of the disturbance, Roman numerals  representing the degrees of the scale of De Rossi-Forel (I-X); then  the region affected most, and finally the damages caused, if known,  and other information, if available.    In describing the epicentral regions, the present distribution of the  Archipelago into provinces has been used throughout the catalogue.  This division is shown on the first of the two maps of the Philippines  which accompany this catalogue (Plate I). As to the designation  \"Benguet\" occasionally occurring in the text where provinces are  enumerated, but not found on the map, we beg to offer the excuse that  the region thus named is exceedingly well known in the Philippines as  it contains Baguio, _the_ health resort of the Islands. For the  readers outside of the Archipelago we remark that Benguet is at  present a subprovince of the Mountain Province, of which it forms the  southernmost part. The location of Baguio is shown on the map on Plate  II. A similar remark applies to Lepanto and Bontoc, likewise divisions  of the Mountain Province, whose capitals, Cervantes and Bontoc, are  indicated on the same map.    As we would hardly be justified in assuming that every reader is in  possession of a detailed map of the Philippines, and a knowledge of  the general distribution and the main directions of the principal  mountain systems of an earthquake country is important, we add a  second map on which these data are shown by means of dashes, together  with the most important seismic regions, and the positions of the  principal towns, bays, etc., mentioned in the text. (Plate II.)    Near the left margin of this second map will be found an index of the  seismic regions just mentioned, each of them being represented by its  ordinal number (large Roman figures). Near each of these ordinals is  placed the corresponding number of earthquakes since 1862 contained in  the catalogue (Arabic figures), which is followed, in brackets, by an  analysis of the said number, in which Roman figures designate the  degrees of the earthquake, scale of De Rossi-Forel, while small Arabic  figures, written like exponents, give the number of earthquakes of  each degree of intensity.    In drawing the map on Plate II it was not intended to represent the  epicentric area of every individual earthquake center (which would  have crowded the map beyond reasonable limits), but rather to show the  principal seismic regions. Hence most of these curves contain more  than one focus. The approximate position of each of the latter has,  however, been indicated by a star, while the figure placed close to  the star gives the number of earthquakes which proceeded from the said  center.    A word must be said in apology for the constant use in the following  list of the Spanish word \"_convento_.\" This word which means  monastery, cloister, or convent, is universally used in the  Philippines to designate also the habitation of the clergy attached to  a parish church. Although these are, as a rule, spacious buildings and  were formerly inhabited well-nigh exclusively by friars, they can not  properly be called monasteries. Wherefore, in order to avoid lengthy  circumlocutions, the Spanish word \"_convento_\" has been retained.    The reader who is not familiar with this country may find it strange  that in reporting earthquake damages so much emphasis appears to be  laid on the harm done to churches and _conventos_. This is easily  explained by the fact that these buildings were often the only  structures within the meizoseismal area, and built nearly everywhere  in the most substantial manner.    In the present catalogue we have also included, by way of an appendix,  the earthquakes which are known to have occurred in the Marianas or  Ladrones group of islands. While their number is too small to warrant  separate publication, we believe that the data concerning them will be  welcome to the earthquake investigator.

The name of      |                    |     |Camarines was at the time used to      |                    |     |designate the present town of Camalig      |                    |     |and the district near the southern slopes      |                    |     |of Mayon Volcano.
