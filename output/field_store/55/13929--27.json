In area each is less than Wales,  while the total population of the country is not twice that of London.    It is its extreme fertility which has made Egypt prosperous, and  throughout the world's history it has been a granary for the nations,  for while drought and famine might affect other lands, Egypt has  always been able to supply food to its neighbours.    How does this come about? Let me try and explain.    Thousands of years ago, when the world was very young, the whole land  was covered by the sea, which is plainly shown by the fossils  embedded in the rocks, and which lie scattered over its highest  deserts.    As the sea receded, the Nile, then a mighty river, began to cut its  channel through the rock, and poured into the sea somewhere about  where Cairo now stands.    As the ages passed the river cut deeper and deeper into its rocky bed,  leaving on either side the mountains which hem in its narrow valley,  and at the same time depositing along its banks and in the delta  forming at its mouth the rich alluvial mud which it had carried with  it from the heart of Africa.    In this way the Egypt of history has been formed, but, surrounded as  it is by sandy wastes, and often swept by hot desert winds, no rain  falls to bring life to the fields, or enable the rich soil to produce  the crops which are its source of wealth.    Nature provides a remedy, however, and the river which first formed  the land is also its life-giver, for every year the Nile overflows its  banks, re-fertilizing the soil, and filling the canals and reservoirs  with water sufficient for the year's needs, without which Egypt would  remain a barren, sun-baked land, instead of the fertile country it is.    The first view of Egypt as it is approached from the sea is  disappointing, for the low-lying delta is hardly raised at all above  sea-level, and its monotony is only broken by an occasional hillock or  the lofty minarets of the coast towns.    [Illustration: AN IRRIGATED FIELD.]    Formerly the Nile had several mouths, and from many seaports Egypt  carried on its trade with the outside world. To-day only Rosetta and  Damietta remain to give their names to the two branches by which  alone the Nile now seeks the sea. These interesting seaports, mediaeval  and richly picturesque, are no longer the prosperous cities they once  were, for railways have diverted traffic from the Nile, and nearly all  the seaborne trade of Egypt is now carried from Alexandria or Port  Said, the northern entrance to the Suez Canal, and it is by either of  these two ports that modern visitors make their entry into Egypt.    Alexandria is interesting as the city founded by Alexander the Great,  but with the exception of Pompey's pillar and its ancient catacombs  has little attraction for visitors. The town is almost entirely  Italian in character, and is peopled by so many different races that  it hardly seems Egypt at all; boys, however, would enjoy a visit to  the Ras-el-Tin Fort, which figured so largely in the bombardment of  Alexandria, and away to the east, near Rosetta, is Aboukir Bay, the  scene of a more stirring fight, for it was here that, in A.D.  1798, Nelson destroyed the French fleet,[1] and secured for Britain  the command of the Mediterranean.    [Footnote 1: In the \"Battle of the Nile.\"]    After the monotony of a sea voyage, landing at Port Said is amusing.  The steamer anchors in mid-stream, and is quickly surrounded by gaily  painted shore boats, whose swarthy occupants--half native, half  Levantine--clamber on board, and clamour and wrangle for the  possession of your baggage. They are noisy fellows, but once your  boatman is selected, landing at the little stages which lie in the  harbour is quickly effected, and you and your belongings are safely  deposited at the station, and your journey to Cairo begun.    Port Said is a rambling town, whose half brick, half timber buildings  have a general air of dilapidation and unfinish which is depressing.  The somewhat picturesque principal bazaar street is soon exhausted,  and excepting for the imposing offices of the Suez Canal Company, and  the fine statue to De Lesseps, recently erected on the breakwater,  Port Said has little else to excite the curiosity of the visitors;  built upon a mud-bank formed of Suez Canal dredgings, its existence is  its most interesting feature, and the white breakers of the  Mediterranean, above which it is so little raised, seem ever ready to  engulf it as they toss and tumble upon its narrow beach.    Leaving Port Said behind, the train travels slowly along the canal  bank, and we begin to enter Egypt.    On the right the quiet waters of Lake Menzala, fringed with tall reeds  and eucalyptus trees, stretches to the far horizon, where quaintly  shaped fishing-boats disappear with their cargoes towards distant  Damietta. Thousands of wild birds, duck of all kinds, ibis and  pelican, fish in the shallows, or with the sea-gulls wheel in dense  masses in the air, for this is a reservation as a breeding-green for  wild-fowl, where they are seldom, if ever, disturbed.    On the left is the Suez Canal, the world's highway to the Far East,  and ships of all nations pass within a stone's throw of your train.  Between, and in strange contrast with the blueness of the canal, runs  a little watercourse, reed fringed, and turbid in its rapid flow.  This is the \"sweet-water\" canal, and gives its name to one of our  engagements with Arabi's army, and which, from the far-distant Nile,  brings fresh water to supply Port Said and the many stations on its  route.    To the south and east stretches the mournful desert in which the  Israelites began their forty years of wandering, and which thousands  of Moslems annually traverse on their weary pilgrimage to Mecca; while  in all directions is mirage, so perfect in its deception as to mislead  the most experienced of travellers at times.    Roaming over the desert which hems in the delta, solitary shepherds,  strangely clad and wild-looking, herd their flocks of sheep and goats  which browse upon the scrub. These are the descendants of those same  Ishmaelites who sold Joseph into Egypt, and the occasional encampment  of some Bedouin tribe shows us something of the life which the  patriarchs might have led.    In contrast with the desert, the delta appears very green and fertile,  for we are quickly in the land of Goshen, most beautiful, perhaps, of  all the delta provinces.    The country is very flat and highly cultivated. In all directions, as  far as the eye can see, broad stretches of corn wave in the gentle  breeze, while brilliant patches of clover or the quieter-coloured  onion crops vary the green of the landscape. The scent of flowering  bean-fields fills the air, and the hum of wild bees is heard above the  other sounds of the fields. Palm groves lift their feathery plumes  towards the sky, and mulberry-trees and dark-toned tamarisks shade the  water-wheels, which, with incessant groanings, are continually turned  by blindfolded bullocks. Villages and little farmsteads are frequent,  and everywhere are the people, men, women, and children, working on  the land which so richly rewards their labour.    The soil is very rich, and, given an ample water-supply, produces two  or three crops a year, while the whole surface is so completely under  cultivation that there is no room left for grass or wild flowers to  grow. Many crops are raised besides those I have already mentioned,  such as maize, barley, rice, and flax, and in the neighbourhood of  towns and villages radishes, cucumbers, melons, and tomatoes are  plentifully grown. Formerly wheat was Egypt's principal crop, but  since its introduction by Mohammed Ali in A.D. 1820, _cotton_  has taken first place amongst its products, and is of so fine a  quality that it is the dearest in the world, and is used almost  entirely for mixing with silk or the manufacture of sateen. Cotton,  however, is very exhausting to the soil, and where it is grown the  land must have its intervals of rest.    No sooner is one crop gathered than yokes of oxen, drawing strangely  shaped wooden ploughs, prepare the land for another; and the newly  turned soil looks black against the vivid clover fields, in which  tethered cattle graze; while large flocks of sheep of many colours, in  which brown predominates, follow the ploughs and feed upon the  stubble, for the native is as economical as he is industrious.    Peopled by a race of born farmers, and in soil and climate provided by  Nature with all that could be desired for crop-raising, only rain is  lacking to bring the fields to fruition, and from the earliest times a  great system of irrigation has existed in Egypt. It is curious to see  in many directions the white lateen sails of boats which appear to be  sailing over the fields. In reality they are sailing on the canals  which intersect the country in all directions, and by means of  thousands of water-wheels and pumps supply the land with water. Though  the Nile overflows its banks, its inundation does not cover the whole  land; so great arterial canals which are filled at high Nile have been  constructed throughout the country. From these, smaller canals branch  right and left, carrying the water to the furthest corners of the  land, while such boundary marks as exist to separate different estates  or farms usually take the form of a watercourse.    These canal banks form the highways of the country, and are thronged  by travellers and laden camels, while large flocks of sheep and goats  are herded along their sloping sides. Every here and there are little  enclosures, spread with clean straw or mats, and surrounded by a fence  of cornstalks or low walls of mud. These are the holy places where in  the intervals of work the devout Moslem may say his prayers; and,  often bowered by shady trees, a whitewashed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18674"],[0,"A Chinese Wonder Book (#2)"],[1," \"Eat and ask no questions,\" counselled the Widow Wang. \"When you are  satisfied I will tell you everything.\"    Wise advice! Very soon the young man's chopsticks were twinkling like  a little star in the verses. He ate long and happily, while his good  mother watched him, her heart overflowing with joy at seeing him at last  able to satisfy his hunger. But still the old woman could hardly wait  for him to finish, she was so anxious to tell him her wonderful secret.    \"Here, son!\" she cried at last, as he began to pause between mouthfuls,  \"look at my treasure!\" And she held out to him the golden beetle.    \"First tell me what good fairy of a rich man has been filling our hands  with silver?\"    \"That's just what I am trying to tell you,\" she laughed, \"for there was  a fairy here this afternoon sure enough, only he was dressed like a bald  priest. That golden beetle is all he gave me, but with it comes a secret  worth thousands of cash to us.\"    The youth fingered the trinket idly, still doubting his senses, and  waiting impatiently for the secret of his delicious dinner. \"But,  mother, what has this brass bauble to do with the dumplings, these  wonderful pork dumplings, the finest I ever ate?\"    \"Baubles indeed! Brass! Fie, fie, my boy! You little know what you are  saying. Only listen and you shall hear a tale that will open your eyes.\"    She then told him what had happened, and ended by setting all of the  left-over dumplings upon the floor for Blackfoot and Whitehead, a thing  her son had never seen her do before, for they had been miserably poor  and had had to save every scrap for the next meal.    Now began a long period of perfect happiness. Mother, son, dog and  cat--all enjoyed themselves to their hearts' content. All manner of new  foods such as they had never tasted were called forth from the pot by  the wonderful little beetle. Bird-nest soup, shark's fins, and a hundred  other delicacies were theirs for the asking, and soon Ming-li regained  all his strength, but, I fear, at the same time grew somewhat lazy, for  it was no longer necessary for him to work. As for the two animals, they  became fat and sleek and their hair grew long and glossy.    [Illustration: \"HERE SON!\" SHE CRIED, \"HAVE A LOOK AT MY TREASURE!\"]    But alas! according to a Chinese proverb, pride invites sorrow. The  little family became so proud of their good fortune that they began to  ask friends and relatives to dinner that they might show off their good  meals. One day a Mr. and Mrs. Chu came from a distant village. They were  much astonished at seeing the high style in which the Wangs lived. They  had expected a beggar's meal, but went away with full stomachs.    \"It's the best stuff I ever ate,\" said Mr. Chu, as they entered their  own tumble-down house.    \"Yes, and I know where it came from,\" exclaimed his wife. \"I saw Widow  Wang take a little gold ornament out of the pot and hide it in a  cupboard. It must be some sort of charm, for I heard her mumbling to  herself about pork and dumplings just as she was stirring up the fire.\"    \"A charm, eh? Why is it that other people have all the luck? It looks as  if we were doomed forever to be poor.\"    \"Why not borrow Mrs. Wang's charm for a few days until we can pick up a  little flesh to keep our bones from clattering? Turn about's fair play.  Of course, we'll return it sooner or later.\"    \"Doubtless they keep very close watch over it. When would you find them  away from home, now that they don't have to work any more? As their  house only contains one room, and that no bigger than ours, it would be  difficult to borrow this golden trinket. It is harder, for more reasons  than one, to steal from a beggar than from a king.\"    \"Luck is surely with us,\" cried Mrs. Chu, clapping her hands. \"They are  going this very day to the Temple fair. I overheard Mrs. Wang tell her  son that he must not forget he was to take her about the middle of the  afternoon. I will slip back then and borrow the little charm from the  box in which she hid it.\"    \"Aren't you afraid of Blackfoot?\"    \"Pooh! he's so fat he can do nothing but roll. If the widow comes back  suddenly, I'll tell her I came to look for my big hair-pin, that I lost  it while I was at dinner.\"    \"All right, go ahead, only of course we must remember we're borrowing  the thing, not stealing it, for the Wangs have always been good friends  to us, and then, too, we have just dined with them.\"    So skilfully did this crafty woman carry out her plans that within an  hour she was back in her own house, gleefully showing the priest's charm  to her husband. Not a soul had seen her enter the Wang house. The dog  had made no noise, and the cat had only blinked her surprise at seeing a  stranger and had gone to sleep again on the floor.    Great was the clamour and weeping when, on returning from the fair in  expectation of a hot supper, the widow found her treasure missing. It  was long before she could grasp the truth. She went back to the little  box in the cupboard ten times before she could believe it was empty, and  the room looked as if a cyclone had struck it, so long and carefully did  the two unfortunates hunt for the lost beetle.    Then came days of hunger which were all the harder to bear since the  recent period of good food and plenty. Oh, if they had only not got used  to such dainties! How hard it was to go back to scraps and scrapings!    But if the widow and her son were sad over the loss of the good meals,  the two pets were even more so. They were reduced to beggary and had to  go forth daily upon the streets in search of stray bones and refuse that  decent dogs and cats turned up their noses at.    One day, after this period of starvation had been going on for some  time, Whitehead began suddenly to frisk about in great excitement.    \"Whatever is the matter with you?\" growled Blackfoot. \"Are you mad from  hunger, or have you caught another flea?\"    \"I was just thinking over our affairs, and now I know the cause of all  our trouble.\"    \"Do you indeed?\" sneered Blackfoot.    \"Yes, I do indeed, and you'd better think twice before you mock me, for  I hold your future in my paw, as you will very soon see.\"    \"Well, you needn't get angry about nothing. What wonderful discovery  have you made--that every rat has one tail?\"    \"First of all, are you willing to help me bring good fortune back to our  family?\"    \"Of course I am. Don't be silly,\" barked the dog, wagging his tail  joyfully at the thought of another good dinner. \"Surely! surely! I will  do anything you like if it will bring Dame Fortune back again.\"    \"All right. Here is the plan. There has been a thief in the house who  has stolen our mistress's golden beetle. You remember all our big  dinners that came from the pot? Well, every day I saw our mistress take  a little golden beetle out of the black box and put it into the pot. One  day she held it up before me, saying, 'Look, puss, there is the cause of  all our happiness. Don't you wish it was yours?' Then she laughed and  put it back into the box that stays in the cupboard.\"    \"Is that true?\" questioned Blackfoot. \"Why didn't you say something  about it before?\"    \"You remember the day Mr. and Mrs. Chu were here, and how Mrs. Chu  returned in the afternoon after master and mistress had gone to the  fair? I saw her, out of the tail of my eye, go to that very black box  and take out the golden beetle. I thought it curious, but never dreamed  she was a thief. Alas! I was wrong! She took the beetle, and if I am not  mistaken, she and her husband are now enjoying the feasts that belong  to us.\"    \"Let's claw them,\" growled Blackfoot, gnashing his teeth.    \"That would do no good,\" counselled the other, \"for they would be sure  to come out best in the end. We want the beetle back--that's the main  thing. We'll leave revenge to human beings; it is none of our business.\"    \"What do you suggest?\" said Blackfoot. \"I am with you through thick and  thin.\"    \"Let's go to the Chu house and make off with the beetle.\"    \"Alas, that I am not a cat!\" moaned Blackfoot. \"If we go there I  couldn't get inside, for robbers always keep their gates well locked. If  I were like you I could scale the wall. It is the first time in all my  life I ever envied a cat.\"    \"We will go together,\" continued Whitehead. \"I will ride on your back  when we are fording the river, and you can protect me from strange  animals. When we get to the Chu house, I will climb over the wall and  manage the rest of the business myself. Only you must wait outside to  help me to get home with the prize.\"    No sooner arranged than done. The companions set out that very night on  their adventure. They crossed the river as the cat had suggested, and  Blackfoot really enjoyed the swim, for, as he said, it took him back to  his puppyhood, while the cat did not get a single drop of water on her  face. It was midnight when they reached the Chu house.    \"Just wait till I return,\" purred Whitehead in Blackfoot's ear.    With a mighty spring she reached the top of the mud wall, and then  jumped down to the inside court. While she was resting in the shadow,  trying to decide just how to go about her work, a slight rustling  attracted her attention, and pop! one giant spring, one stretch-out of  the claws, and she had caught a rat that had just come out of his hole  for a drink and a midnight walk.    Now, Whitehead was so hungry that she would have made short work of this  tempting prey if the rat had not opened its mouth and, to her amazement,  begun to talk in good cat dialect.    \"Pray, good puss, not so fast with your sharp teeth! Kindly be careful  with your claws! Don't you know it is the custom now to put prisoners on  their honour? I will promise not to run away.\"    \"Pooh! what honour has a rat?\"    \"Most of us haven't much, I grant you, but my family was brought up  under the roof of Confucius, and there we picked up so many crumbs of"]]]
