[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16116"],[0,"Studies of Trees (#2)"],[1,"the tree may be told by the *right angles* which the      branches form with the main trunk, Fig. 3. No other pine shows this      character.    Form and size: A tall tree, the stateliest of the evergreens.    Range: Eastern North America.    Soil and location: Prefers a deep, sandy soil, but will grow in almost      any soil.    Enemies: Sucking insects forming white downy patches on the bark and      twigs, the _white pine weevil_, a boring insect, and the _white pine      blister rust_, a fungus, are among its principal enemies.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--The White Pine.]    Value for planting: Aside from its value as an ornamental tree, the      white pine is an excellent tree to plant on abandoned farms and for      woodlands and windbreaks throughout the New England States, New      York, Pennsylvania, and the Lake States.    Commercial value: The wood is easily worked, light, durable, and will      not warp. It is used for naval construction, lumber, shingles,      laths, interior finish, wooden ware, etc.    Other characters: The _fruit_ is a cone, four to six inches long.    Comparisons: The tree is apt to be confused with the _Bhotan pine_      (_Pinus excelsa_), which is commonly grown as an ornamental tree.      The Bhotan pine, however, has needles much longer and more drooping      in appearance.      THE PITCH PINE (_Pinus rigida_)    Distinguishing characters: Here there are *three* needles to each      cluster, Fig. 4. They are dark, yellowish-green needles about four      inches long. The rough-looking _branches_ of the tree may be seen      _studded with cones_ throughout the year, and _clusters of leaves_      may be seen _sprouting directly from the trunk_ of the tree; see      Fig. 5. The last two are very characteristic and will distinguish      the tree at a glance.      Form and size: It is a low tree of uncertain habit and extremely rough      looking at every stage of its life. It is constantly full of dead      branches and old cones which persist on the tree throughout the      year.    Range: Eastern United States.    Soil and location: Grows in the poorest and sandiest soils where few      other trees will grow. In New Jersey and on Long Island where it is      native, it proves so hardy and persistent that it often forms pure      stands excluding other trees.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Twig of the Pitch Pine.]    Enemies: None of importance.    Value for planting: Well adapted for the sea coast and other exposed      places. It is of extremely uncertain habit and is subject to the      loss of the lower limbs. It frequently presents a certain      picturesqueness of outline, but it could not be used as a specimen      tree on the lawn.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--The Pitch Pine.]    Commercial value: The wood is coarse grained and is used for rough      lumber, fuel, and charcoal.    Other characters: The _fruit_ is a cone one to three  inches long, persistent on the tree for several years.      THE SCOTCH PINE (_Pinus sylvestris_)    Distinguishing characters: There are *two* needles to each cluster, and      these are _short_ compared with those of the white pine, and      _slightly twisted_; see Fig. 6. The _bark_, especially along the      upper portion of the trunk, _is reddish_ in color.    Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a short crown.    Range: Europe, Asia, and eastern United States.    Soil and location: Will do best on a deep, rich, sandy soil, but will      also grow on a dry, porous soil.    Enemies: In Europe the Scotch pine has several insect enemies, but in      America it appears to be free from injury.    Value for planting: Suitable for windbreaks and woodland planting. Many      excellent specimens may also be found in our parks.    Commercial value: In the United States, the wood is chiefly used for      fuel, though slightly used for barrels, boxes, and carpentry. In      Europe, the Scotch pine is an important timber tree.    Comparisons: The Scotch pine is apt to be confused with the _Austrian      pine_ (_Pinus austriaca_), because they both have two needles to      each cluster. The needles of the Austrian pine, however, are much      longer, coarser, straighter, and darker than those of the Scotch      pine; Fig. 1. The form of the Austrian pine, too, is more      symmetrical and compact.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Twig of the Scotch Pine.]        The _red pine_ (_Pinus resinosa_) is another tree that has two      needles to each cluster, but these are much longer than those of the      Scotch pine (five to six inches) and are straighter. The bark, which      is reddish in color, also differentiates the red pine from the      Austrian pine. The position of the cones on the red pine, which      point outward and downward at maturity, will also help to      distinguish this tree from the Scotch and the Austrian varieties.        GROUP II. THE SPRUCE AND HEMLOCK    How to tell them from other trees: The spruce and hemlock belong to the      evergreen class and may be told from the other trees by their      _leaves_. The characteristic leaves of the spruce are shown in Fig.      9; those of the hemlock in Fig. 10. These are much shorter than the      needles of the pines but are longer than the leaves of the red cedar      or arbor vitae. They are neither arranged in clusters like those of      the larch, nor in feathery layers like those of the cypress. They      adhere to the tree throughout the year, while the leaves of the      larch and cypress shed in the fall.        The spruces are pyramidal-shaped trees, with tall and tapering      trunks, thickly covered with branches, forming a compact crown. They      are widely distributed throughout the cold and temperate regions of      the northern hemisphere, where they often form thick forests over      extended areas.        There are eighteen recognized species of spruce. The Norway spruce      has been chosen as a type for this group because it is so commonly      planted in the northeastern part of the United States.        The hemlock is represented by seven species, confined to temperate      North America, Japan, and Central and Western China.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--The Norway Spruce.]    How to tell them from each other: The needles and branches of the spruce      are _coarse_; those of the hemlock are _flat and graceful_. The      individual leaves of the spruce, Fig. 9, are four-sided and green or      blue on the under side, while those of the hemlock, Fig. 10, are      flat and are _marked by two white lines_ on the under side.      THE NORWAY SPRUCE (_Picea excelsa_)    Distinguishing characters: The characteristic appearance of the      full-grown tree is due to the *drooping branchlets* carried on *main      branches which bend upward* (Fig. 7).    Leaf: The leaves are dark green in color and are _arranged spirally_,      thus making the twigs coarser to the touch than the twigs of the      hemlock or fir. In cross-section, the individual leaflet is      quadrilateral, while that of the pine is triangular.    Form and size: A large tree with a straight, undivided trunk and a      well-shaped, conical crown (Fig. 7).    Range: Northern Europe, Asia, northern North America.    Soil and location: Grows in cool, moist situations.    Enemies: The foliage of the spruce is sometimes affected by _red      spider_, but is apt to be more seriously injured by drought, wind,      and late frosts.    Value for planting: Commonly planted as an ornamental tree and for      hedges. It does well for this purpose in a cool northern climate,      but in the vicinity of New York City and further south it does not      do as well, losing its lower branches at an early age, and becoming      generally scraggly in appearance.    [Illustration: FIG. 8.--A Group of Hemlock.]    Commercial value: The wood is light and soft and is used for      construction timber, paper pulp, and fuel.    Other characters: The _fruit_ is a large slender cone, four to seven      inches long.    Comparisons: The _white spruce_ (_Picea canadensis_) may be told from      the Norway spruce by the whitish color on the under side of its      leaves and the unpleasant, pungent odor emitted from the needles      when bruised. The cones of the white spruce, about two inches long,      are shorter than these of the Norway spruce, but are longer than      those of the black spruce.        It is essentially a northern tree growing in all sorts of locations      along the streams and on rocky mountain slopes as far north as the      Arctic Sea and Alaska. It often appears as an ornamental tree as far      south as New York and Pennsylvania.        The _black spruce_ (_Picea mariana_) may be told from the other      spruces by its small cone, which is usually only about one inch in      length. In New England it seldom grows to as large a size as the      other spruce trees.        It covers large areas in various parts of northern North America and      grows to its largest size in Manitoba. The black spruce has little      value as an ornamental tree.        The _Colorado blue spruce_ (_Picea parryana_ or _Picea pungens_)      which is commonly used as an ornamental tree on lawns and in parks,      can be told from the other spruces by its pale-blue or sage-green      color and its sharp-pointed, coarse-feeling twigs. Its small size      and sharp-pointed conical form are also characteristic.        It grows to a large size in Colorado and the Middle West. In the      Eastern States and in northern Europe where it is planted as an      ornamental tree, it is usually much smaller.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Twig of the Norway Spruce.]      HEMLOCK (_Tsuga canadensis_)    Distinguishing characters: Its leaves are arranged in *flat layers*,      giving a flat, horizontal and graceful appearance to the whole      branch (Fig. 8). The individual leaves are dark green above, lighter      colored below, and are *marked by two white"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16119"],[0,"Doctrina Christiana (#2)"],[1,"[the coating],      for the purpose of whitening it and making the surface smooth,      a deplorable business, for it made the paper very moisture      absorbent, a condition fatal in such a humid climate as      in these islands. Moreover, as the alum used is impure and      contains a large proportion of iron salts, the humidity and      weather oxidize it which finally darkens the paper, so that      Philippine books present a coloration which runs the gamut      of tones from the color of bone to that of dark cinnamon.\" [3]      Because the Doctrina Christiana, which may well be translated \"The  Teachings of Christianity,\" contains the basic elements of the religion  which the missionaries were trying to spread among the unbaptized  in the remote regions of the world, it was the most useful handbook  they had. A summary of the contents of the present edition shows the  fundamental character of the work. After a syllabary comes the Pater  Noster, the primary and most popular prayer of Christianity. Then  follow the Ave Maria, Credo, Salve Regina, Articles of Faith, Ten  Commandments, Commandments of the Holy Church, Sacraments of the Holy  Church, Seven Mortal Sins, Fourteen Works of Charity, Confession  and Catechism. Here in a small compass is presented the simplest,  most easily learned and most essential tenets of the Catholic Church.    So useful was the Doctrina considered as a guide for those who had  just been, or were about to be, converted that the missionary fathers  placed it in most cases foremost among the books necessary to have  in print in a strange land. It is generally accepted today, although  no extant copy is known, that the first book printed in Mexico [4]  in 1539 was a Doctrina in Mexican and Spanish. Recent research has  shown that the second book printed by the pioneer Jesuit press at Goa,  in India, in 1557 was St. Francis Xavier's _Doutrina Christao_ [5]  in the Malay language, of which also no copy has yet been located. But  there are copies of the first book to come from a South American press,  another Doctrina [6] printed in the native and Spanish languages at  Lima in 1584. So the choice of this book as the first to be printed  at Manila follows a widespread precedent.    We have then a book, the Doctrina Christiana, in Spanish and Tagalog,  corrected by priests of more than one order--and this is important  in tracing the authorship of the work--and printed by the xylographic  method with license at Manila at the Dominican Church of San Gabriel  in 1593. So much we get from the title, and in itself it is a fairly  complete story, but from the date of its issue until the present time  that very fundamental information has not been completely recorded.          THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY      In tracing our clues down through the years, we find at the very  beginning the most valuable evidence which has been uncovered, short  of the book itself. From Manila on June 20, 1593, the Governor of the  Philippines, Gomez Perez Dasmarinas, wrote a letter to Philip II of  Spain in which he said:          \"Sire, in the name of Your Majesty, I have for this once,      because of the existing great need, granted a license for the      printing of the Doctrinas Christianas, herewith enclosed--one      in the Tagalog language, which is the native and best of these      islands, and the other in Chinese--from which I hope great      benefits will result in the conversion and instruction of the      peoples of both nations; and because the lands of the Indies      are on a larger scale in everything and things more expensive,      I have set the price of them at four reales a piece, until Your      Majesty is pleased to decree in full what is to be done.\" [7]      This states unequivocally that two books were printed at Manila some  time before June 20, 1593, one of which was the Doctrina in Tagalog,  and the other the same work in Chinese. Although we are chiefly  concerned here with the former, the fact that they were produced at  about the same time and probably at the same place makes it necessary  to trace the history of both in order to reconstruct the circumstances  surrounding the production of the one. Of the Chinese Doctrina no  copy has yet come to light, and except for two 1593 references,  there are no records of its existence.    Another document [8] of 1593 verifies the information given in the  letter of Dasmarinas, differing from it only in one detail. In the  Archives of the Indies was found a manuscript account of 1593 listing  books written in the Philippines, which says:          \"There have been printed primers and catechisms of the faith,      one in Spanish and Tagalog, which is the native language, and      the other in Chinese, which are being sent to Your Majesty,      the Tagalog priced at two reales and the Chinese at four,      which is hoped will be of great benefit.\"      The accounts of the printing of two Doctrinas contained in these  documents confirm some of the information of the title and add a bit  more. First, the letter says that the book was printed by permission  given by the Governor, which agrees with the \"with license\" of the  title, \"for this once because of the existing great need.\" By a royal  cedula [9] of September 21, 1556, which was promulgated again on August  14, 1560, it had been ordered that Justices \"not consent to or permit  to be printed or sold any book containing material concerning the  Indies without having special license sent by our Royal Council of the  Indies,\" and on May 8, 1584 this was implemented by the further order  \"that when any grammar or dictionary of the language of the Indies be  made it shall not be published, or printed or used unless it has first  been examined by the Bishop and seen by the Royal Audiencia.\" This  latter portion was applied specifically to the Philippines in a letter  [10] from Philip II to the Audiencia of Manila, also dated May 8,  1584, to which further reference will be made. It can be gathered  from Dasmarinas' implied apology that he had never before given such  a license, and, since he had arrived in the Philippines in 1590, that  no books had been printed between that time and the licensing of the  Doctrinas. It is, moreover, likely that if any similar books had been  printed during the administrations of his predecessors he would have  mentioned the fact as a precedent for acting contrary to the cedulas.    According to Dasmarinas he had priced the books at four reales a  piece, which followed the regular Spanish procedure, under which  books were subject to price control. The Governor, it will be noted,  also apologized for the high price he was forced to set, giving  general high prices [11] as his excuse. Yet, while the appraisal of  four reales for this book was high compared to the prevailing scale  in Spain, it was not high compared to prices allowed in Mexico. On  June 6, 1542 the Emperor had given the Casa de Cromberger, the first  printing-house in Mexico, permission [12] to sell books printed there  at seventeen maravedis a sheet, or exactly one half a real. If we  assume that, although the Doctrina had been printed page by page,  it was quarto in size and so appraised on the basis of eight pages  to a sheet, we find that the price per sheet comes to about fourteen  maravedis, or less than half a real. However, a contradiction occurs  between the letter of Dasmarinas and this copy of the Doctrina,  supported by the other 1593 document. On the verso of the title, Juan  de Cuellar, [13] the Governor's secretary and the logical person to  sign the official valuation, gives the price as two reales, and the  1593 account, while agreeing with the letter as far as the Chinese  Doctrina is concerned, also lists the price of the Tagalog Doctrina  as two reales. It is impossible to say what caused the discrepancy;  perhaps it was a decision on Dasmarinas' part to lower the cost,  notwithstanding inflationary values, in order to make the book more  readily available for the natives who were not economically as well  off as the Chinese, or it could be that after the letter had been  written it was noticed that the Chinese volume was larger than the  Tagalog one, and some adjustment made. In any event, the price of this  Doctrina was finally set at two reales, making it less than half the  price allowed in Mexico fifty years before.    The evidence of the two 1593 documents would seem conclusive with  regard to printing in 1593, but witnesses were not long in appearing  who stated something quite different. The earliest of these was  Pedro Chirino, [14] a Jesuit priest, who came to the Philippines with  Dasmarinas in 1590. He went back to Europe in 1602, and while there  had a history of the Philippines printed at Rome in 1604. In 1606 he  returned to the islands, where he died in 1635. He left unpublished  the manuscript of another and more detailed history, dated 1610,  which contains a most significant passage, where, after speaking of  various early writers in native languages, he continues:          \"Those who printed first were; P. Fr. Juan de Villanueva of      the Order of St. Augustine [who printed] certain little tracts,      and P. Fr. Francisco de San Joseph of the Order of St. Dominic      [who printed] larger things of more bulk.\" [15]      Concerning this Juan de Villanueva [16] very little indeed is  known. From what has been recorded it would seem that there were two  Augustinians of the same name who were in the Philippines before  1600. The first of these was a secular priest who came to Cebu  about 1566, may have taken the Augustinian habit some time after his  arrival, and died not long after 1569. The other Juan de Villanueva,  the date of whose arrival is unknown, was in Lubao in 1590, in Hagonoy  in 1593, and prior of Batangas from 1596 until his death in 1599. Of  the two there can be no doubt but that Chirino referred to the second  one. But, apart from"]]]
