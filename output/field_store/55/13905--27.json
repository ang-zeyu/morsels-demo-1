[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18214"],[0,"Our Friend the Dog (#2)"],[1," a soft tune and dandles three saucepans  blissfully dancing; and, from the little hole that lights up its inside,  defies the good dog who cannot approach, by constantly putting out at  him its fiery tongue. The clock, bored in its oak case, before striking  the august hour of meal time, swings its great gilt navel to and fro;  and the cunning flies tease your ears. On the glittering table lie a  chicken, a hare, three partridges, besides other things which are called  fruits--peaches, melons, grapes--and which are all good for nothing. The  cook guts a big silver fish and throws the entrails (instead of giving  them to you!) into the dust-bin. Ah, the dust-bin! Inexhaustible  treasury, receptacle of windfalls, the jewel of the house! You shall  have your share of it, an exquisite and surreptitious share; but it does  not do to seem to know where it is. You are strictly forbidden to  rummage in it. Man in this way prohibits many pleasant things, and life  would be dull indeed and your days empty if you had to obey all the  orders of the pantry, the cellar and the dining-room. Luckily, he is  absent-minded and does not long remember the instructions which he  lavishes. He is easily deceived. You achieve your ends and do as you  please, provided you have the patience to await the hour. You are  subject to man, and he is the one god; but you none the less have your  own personal, exact and imperturbable morality, which proclaims aloud  that illicit acts become most lawful through the very fact that they  are performed without the master's knowledge. Therefore, let us close  the watchful eye that has seen. Let us pretend to sleep and to dream of  the moon....    Hark! A gentle tapping at the blue window that looks out on the garden!  What is it? Nothing; a bough of hawthorn that has come to see what we  are doing in the cool kitchen. Trees are inquisitive and often excited;  but they do not count, one has nothing to say to them, they are  irresponsible, they obey the wind, which has no principles.... But what  is that? I hear steps!... Up, ears open; nose on the alert!... It is the  baker coming up to the rails, while the postman is opening a little gate  in the hedge of lime-trees. They are friends; it is well; they bring  something: you can greet them and wag your tail discreetly twice or  thrice, with a patronizing smile....    Another alarm! What is it now? A carriage pulls up in front of the  steps. The problem is a complex one. Before all, it is of consequence to  heap copious insults on the horses, great, proud beasts, who make no  reply. Meantime, you examine out of the corner of your eye the persons  alighting. They are well-clad and seem full of confidence. They are  probably going to sit at the table of the gods. The proper thing is to  bark without acrimony, with a shade of respect, so as to show that you  are doing your duty, but that you are doing it with intelligence.  Nevertheless, you cherish a lurking suspicion and, behind the guests'  backs, stealthily, you sniff the air persistently and in a knowing way,  in order to discern any hidden intentions.    But halting footsteps resound outside the kitchen. This time it is the  poor man dragging his crutch, the unmistakable enemy, the hereditary  enemy, the direct descendant of him who roamed outside the bone-cramped  cave which you suddenly see again in your racial memory. Drunk with  indignation, your bark broken, your teeth multiplied with hatred and  rage, you are about to seize their reconcilable adversary by the  breeches, when the cook, armed with her broom, the ancillary and  forsworn sceptre, comes to protect the traitor, and you are obliged to  go back to your hole, where, with eyes filled with impotent and  slanting flames, you growl out frightful, but futile curses, thinking  within yourself that this is the end of all things, and that the human  species has lost its notion of justice and injustice....    Is that all? Not yet; for the smallest life is made up of innumerous  duties, and it is a long work to organize a happy existence upon the  borderland of two such different worlds as the world of beasts and the  world of men. How should we fare if we had to serve, while remaining  within our own sphere, a divinity, not an imaginary one, like to  ourselves, because the offspring of our own brain, but a god actually  visible, ever present, ever active and as foreign, as superior to our  being as we are to the dog?    [Illustration]    We now, to return to Pelleas, know pretty well what to do and how to  behave on the master's premises. But the world does not end at the  house-door, and, beyond the walls and beyond the hedge, there is a  universe of which one has not the custody, where one is no longer at  home, where relations are changed. How are we to stand in the street, in  the fields, in the market-place, in the shops? In consequence of  difficult and delicate observations, we understand that we must take no  notice of passers-by; obey no calls but the master's; be polite, with  indifference, to strangers who pet us. Next, we must conscientiously  fulfil certain obligations of mysterious courtesy toward our brothers  the other dogs; respect chickens and ducks; not appear to remark the  cakes at the pastry-cook's, which spread themselves insolently within  reach of the tongue; show to the cats, who, on the steps of the houses,  provoke us by hideous grimaces, a silent contempt, but one that will not  forget; and remember that it is lawful and even commendable to chase and  strangle mice, rats, wild rabbits and, generally speaking, all animals  (we learn to know them by secret marks) that have not yet made their  peace with mankind.    All this and so much more!... Was it surprising that Pelleas often  appeared pensive in the face of those numberless problems, and that his  humble and gentle look was often so profound and grave, laden with cares  and full of unreadable questions?    [Illustration]    Alas, he did not have time to finish the long and heavy task which  nature lays upon the instinct that rises in order to approach a brighter  region.... An ill of a mysterious character, which seems specially to  punish the only animal that succeeds in leaving the circle in which it  is born; an indefinite ill that carries off hundreds of intelligent  little dogs, came to put an end to the destiny and the happy education  of Pelleas. And now all those efforts to achieve a little more light;  all that ardour in loving, that courage in understanding; all that  affectionate gaiety and innocent fawning; all those kind and devoted  looks, which turned to man to ask for his assistance against unjust  death; all those flickering gleams which came from the profound abyss of  a world that is no longer ours; all those nearly human little habits lie  sadly in the cold ground, under a flowering elder-tree, in a corner of  the garden.          II      Man loves the dog, but how much more ought he to love it if he  considered, in the inflexible harmony of the laws of nature, the sole  exception, which is that love of a being that succeeds in piercing, in  order to draw closer to us, the partitions, every elsewhere impermeable,  that separate the species! We are alone, absolutely alone on this chance  planet; and amid all the forms of life that surround us, not one,  excepting the dog, has made an alliance with us. A few creatures fear  us, most are unaware of us, and not one loves us. In the world of  plants, we have dumb and motionless slaves; but they serve us in spite  of themselves. They simply endure our laws and our yoke. They are  impotent prisoners, victims incapable of escaping, but silently  rebellious; and, so soon as we lose sight of them, they hasten to betray  us and return to their former wild and mischievous liberty. The rose  and the corn, had they wings, would fly at our approach like the birds.    Among the animals, we number a few servants who have submitted only  through indifference, cowardice or stupidity: the uncertain and craven  horse, who responds only to pain and is attached to nothing; the passive  and dejected ass, who stays with us only because he knows not what to do  nor where to go, but who nevertheless, under the cudgel and the  pack-saddle, retains the idea that lurks behind his ears; the cow and  the ox, happy so long as they are eating, and docile because, for  centuries, they have not had a thought of their own; the affrighted  sheep, who knows no other master than terror; the hen, who is faithful  to the poultry-yard because she finds more maize and wheat there than in  the neighbouring forest. I do not speak of the cat, to whom we are  nothing more than a too large and uneatable prey: the ferocious cat,  whose sidelong contempt tolerates us only as encumbering parasites in  our own homes. She, at least, curses us in her mysterious heart; but all  the others live beside us as they might live beside a rock or a tree.  They do not love us, do not know us, scarcely notice us. They are  unaware of our life, our death, our departure, our return, our sadness,  our joy, our smile. They do not even hear the sound of our voice, so  soon as it no longer threatens them; and, when they look at us, it is  with the distrustful bewilderment of the horse, in whose eye still  hovers the infatuation of the elk or gazelle that sees us for the first  time, or with the dull stupor of the ruminants, who look upon us as a  momentary and useless accident of the pasture.    For thousands of years, they have been living at our side, as foreign  to our thoughts, our affections, our habits as though the least  fraternal of the stars had dropped them but yesterday on our globe. In  the boundless interval that separates man from all the other creatures,  we have succeeded only, by dint of patience, in making them take two or  three illusory steps. And if, to-morrow, leaving their feelings toward  us untouched, nature were to give them the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18222"],[0,"The Religion of Numa (#2)"],[1," so that their evil influence may be removed and the thing itself may  prosper. These doubles are not as yet gods, they are merely powers,  potentialities, but in the course of time they develop into gods. The  first step in this direction is the obtaining of a _name_, a name the  knowledge of which gives a certain control over the power to him who  knows it. Finally these powers equipped with a name begin to take on  personal characteristics, to be thought of as individuals, and finally  represented under the form of men.    It cannot be shown that all the gods of Rome originated in this way, but  certainly many of them did, and it is not impossible that they all did;  and this theory of their origin explains better than any other theory  certain habits of thought which the early Romans cherished in regard to  their gods. At the time when our knowledge of Roman religion begins,  Rome is in possession of a great many gods, but very few of them are  much more than names for powers. They are none of them personal enough  to be connected together in myths. And this is the very simple reason  why there was no such thing as a native Roman mythology, a blank in  Rome's early development which many modern writers have refused to  admit, taking upon themselves the unnecessary trouble of positing an  original mythology later lost. The gods of early Rome were neither  married nor given in marriage; they had no children or grandchildren and  there were no divine genealogies. Instead they were thought of  occasionally as more or less individual powers, but usually as masses of  potentialities, grouped together for convenience as the \"gods of the  country,\" the \"gods of the storeroom,\" the \"gods of the dead,\" etc. Even  when they were conceived of as somewhat individual, they were usually  very closely associated with the corresponding object, for example Vesta  was not so much the goddess of the hearth as the goddess \"Hearth\"  itself, Janus not the god of doors so much as the god \"Door.\"    But by just as much as the human element was absent from the concept of  the deity, by just so much the element of formalism in the cult was  greater. This formalism must not be interpreted according to our modern  ideas; it was not a formalism which was the result and the successor of  a decadent spirituality; it was not a secondary product in an age of the  decline of faith; but it was itself the essence of religion in the  period of the greatest religious purity. In the careful and  conscientious fulfilment of the form consisted the whole duty of man  toward his gods. Such a state of affairs would have been intolerable in  any nation whose instincts were less purely legal. So identical were the  laws concerning the gods and the laws concerning men that though in the  earliest period of Roman jurisprudence the _ius divinum_ and the _ius  humanum_ are already separated, they are separated merely formally as  two separate fields or provinces in which the spirit of the law and  often even the letter of its enactment are the same. Such a formalism  implies a very firm belief in the existence of the gods. The dealings of  a man with the gods are quite as really reciprocal as his dealings with  his fellow citizens. But on the other hand though the existence of the  gods is never doubted for a moment, the gods themselves are an unknown  quantity; hence out of the formal relationship an intimacy never  developed, and while it is scarcely just to characterise the early cult  as exclusively a religion of fear, certainly real affection is not  present until a much later day. The potentiality of the gods always  overshadowed their personality. But this was not all loss, for the  absence of personality prevented the growth of those gross myths which  are usually found among primitive peoples, for the purer more inspiring  myths of gods are not the primitive product but result from the process  of refining which accompanies a people's growth in culture. Thus the  theory of animism illumines the religious condition of that borderland  of history in which Romulus and Numa Pompilius have their  dwelling-place.    According to that pleasant fiction of which the ancient world was so  extremely fond--the belief that all institutions could be traced back to  their establishment by some individual--the religion of Rome was  supposed to have been founded by her second king Numa, and it was the  custom to refer to all that was most antique in the cult as forming a  part of the venerable \"religion of Numa.\" For us this can be merely a  name, and even as a name misleading, for a part of the beliefs with  which we are dealing go back for centuries before Romulus and the  traditional B.C. 753 as the foundation of Rome. But it is a convenient  term if we mean by it merely the old kingdom before foreign influences  began to work. The Romans of a later time coined an excellent name not  so much for the period as for the kind of religion which existed then,  contrasting the original deities of Rome with the new foreign gods,  calling the former the \"old indigenous gods\" (_Di Indigetes_) and the  latter the \"newly settled gods\" (_Di Novensides_). For our knowledge of  the religion of this period we are not dependent upon a mere theory, no  matter how good it may be in itself, but we have the best sort of  contemporary evidence in addition, and it is to the discovery of this  evidence that the modern study of Roman religion virtually owes its  existence. The records of early political history were largely  destroyed in B.C. 390 when the Gauls sacked Rome, but the religious  status, with the conservativeness characteristic of religion generally,  suffered very few changes during all these years, and left a record of  itself in the annually recurring festivals of the Roman year, festivals  which grew into an instinctive function of the life of the common  people. Many centuries later when the calendar was engraved on stone,  these revered old festivals were inscribed on these stone calendars in  peculiarly large letters as distinguished from all the other items. Thus  from the fragments of these stone calendars, which have been found, and  which are themselves nineteen centuries old, we can read back another  eight or ten centuries further. By the aid of this \"calendar of Numa\" we  are able to assert the presence of certain deities in the Rome of this  time, and the equally important absence of others. And from the  character of the deities present and of the festivals themselves a  correct and more or less detailed picture of the religious condition of  the time may be drawn. This calendar and the list of _Indigetes_  extracted from it form the foundation for all our study of the history  of Roman religion.    The religious forms of a community are always so bound up with its  social organisation that a satisfactory knowledge of the one is  practically impossible without some knowledge of the other.  Unfortunately there is no field in Roman history where theories are so  abundant and facts so rare as in regard to the question of the early  social organisation. But without coming into conflict with any of the  rival theories we may make at least the following statements. In the  main the community was fairly uniform and homogeneous, there were no  great social extremes and no conspicuous foreign element, so that each  individual, had he stopped to analyse his social position, would have  found himself in four distinct relationships: a relationship to himself  as an individual; to his family; to the group of families which formed  his clan (_gens_); and finally to the state. We may go a step further on  safe ground and assert that the least important of these relations was  that to himself, and the most important that to his family. The unit of  early Roman social life was not the individual but the family, and in  the most primitive ideas of life after death it is the family which has  immortality, not the individual. The state is not a union of individuals  but of families. The very psychological idea of the individual seems to  have taken centuries to develop, and to have reached its real  significance only under the empire. Of the four elements therefore we  have established the pre-eminence of the family and the importance of  the state as based on the family idea; the individual may be disregarded  in this early period, and there is left only the clan, which however  offers a difficult problem. The family and the state were destined to  hold their own, merely exchanging places in the course of time, so that  the state came first and the family second; the individual was to grow  into ever increasing importance, but the clan is already dying when  history begins. It is a pleasant theory and one that has a high degree  of probability that there may have been a time when the clan was to the  family what the state is when history begins, and that when the state  arose out of a union of various clans, the immediate allegiance of each  family was gradually alienated from its clan and transferred to the  state, so that the clan gave up its life in order that the state, the  child of its own creation, might live. If this be so, we can see why the  social importance of the clan ceases so early in Roman history.    The centre therefore of early religious life is the family, and the  state as a macrocosm of the family; and the father of each family is its  chief priest, and the king as the father of the state is the chief  priest of the state. As for the individual the only god which he has for  worship is his \"double,\" called in the case of a man his _Genius_ and in  that of a woman her _Juno_, her individualisation of the goddess Juno,  quite a distinct deity, peculiar to herself. But even here the family  instinct shows itself, and though later the Genius and the Juno  represent all that is intellectual in the individual, they seem  originally to have symbolised the"]]]
