If the layman will but understand that chemistry is the fundamental  _science of the transformation of matter_, he will readily accept the  validity of this sweeping assertion: he will realize, for instance, why  exactly the same fundamental laws of the science apply to, and make  possible scientific control of, such widely divergent national  industries as agriculture and steel manufacturing. It governs the  transformation of the salts, minerals and humus of our fields and the  components of the air into corn, wheat, cotton and the innumerable other  products of the soil; it governs no less the transformation of crude  ores into steel and alloys, which, with the cunning born of chemical  knowledge, may be given practically any conceivable quality of hardness,  elasticity, toughness or strength. And exactly the same thing may be  said of the hundreds of national activities that lie between the two  extremes of agriculture and steel manufacture!    Moreover, the domain of the science of the transformation of matter  includes even life itself as its loftiest phase: from our birth to our  return to dust the laws of chemistry are the controlling laws of life,  health, disease and death, and the ever clearer recognition of this  relation is the strongest force that is raising medicine from the  uncertain realm of an art to the safer sphere of an exact science. To  many scientific minds it has even become evident that those most  wonderful facts of life, heredity and character, must find their final  explanation in the chemical composition of the components of life  producing, germinal protoplasm: mere form and shape are no longer  supreme but are relegated to their proper place as the housing only of  the living matter which functions chemically.    It must be quite obvious now why thoughtful men are insisting that the  public should be awakened to a broad realization of the significance of  the science of chemistry for its national life.    It is a difficult science in its details, because it has found that it  can best interpret the visible phenomena of the material world on the  basis of the conception of invisible minute material atoms and  molecules, each a world in itself, whose properties may be nevertheless  accurately deduced by a rigorous logic controlling the highest type of  scientific imagination. But a layman is interested in the wonders of  great bridges and of monumental buildings without feeling the need of  inquiring into the painfully minute and extended calculations of the  engineer and architect of the strains and stresses to which every pin  and every bar of the great bridge and every bit of stone, every foot of  arch in a monumental edifice, will be exposed. So the public may  understand and appreciate with the keenest interest the results of  chemical effort without the need of instruction in the intricacies of  our logic, of our dealings with our minute, invisible particles.    The whole nation's welfare demands, indeed, that our public be  enlightened in the matter of the relation of chemistry to our national  life. Thus, if our commerce and our industries are to survive the  terrific competition that must follow the reestablishment of peace, our  public must insist that its representatives in Congress preserve that  independence in chemical manufacturing which the war has forced upon us  in the matter of dyes, of numberless invaluable remedies to cure and  relieve suffering; in the matter, too, of hundreds of chemicals, which  our industries need for their successful existence.    Unless we are independent in these fields, how easily might an  unscrupulous competing nation do us untold harm by the mere device, for  instance, of delaying supplies, or by sending inferior materials to this  country or by underselling our chemical manufacturers and, after the  destruction of our chemical independence, handicapping our industries as  they were in the first year or two of the great war! This is not a mere  possibility created by the imagination, for our economic history  contains instance after instance of the purposeful undermining and  destruction of our industries in finer chemicals, dyes and drugs by  foreign interests bent on preserving their monopoly. If one recalls that  through control, for instance, of dyes by a competing nation, control is  in fact also established over products, valued in the hundreds of  millions of dollars, in which dyes enter as an essential factor, one  may realize indeed the tremendous industrial and commercial power which  is controlled by the single lever--chemical dyes. Of even more vital  moment is chemistry in the domain of health: the pitiful calls of our  hospitals for local anesthetics to alleviate suffering on the operating  table, the frantic appeals for the hypnotic that soothes the epileptic  and staves off his seizure, the almost furious demands for remedy after  remedy, that came in the early years of the war, are still ringing in  the hearts of many of us. No wonder that our small army of chemists is  grimly determined not to give up the independence in chemistry which war  has achieved for us! Only a widely enlightened public, however, can  insure the permanence of what farseeing men have started to accomplish  in developing the power of chemistry through research in every domain  which chemistry touches.    The general public should realize that in the support of great chemical  research laboratories of universities and technical schools it will be  sustaining important centers from which the science which improves  products, abolishes waste, establishes new industries and preserves  life, may reach out helpfully into all the activities of our great  nation, that are dependent on the transformation of matter.    The public is to be congratulated upon the fact that the writer of the  present volume is better qualified than any other man in the country to  bring home to his readers some of the great results of modern chemical  activity as well as some of the big problems which must continue to  engage the attention of our chemists. Dr. Slosson has indeed the unique  quality of combining an exact and intimate knowledge of chemistry with  the exquisite clarity and pointedness of expression of a born writer.    We have here an exposition by a master mind, an exposition shorn of the  terrifying and obscuring technicalities of the lecture room, that will  be as absorbing reading as any thrilling romance. For the story of  scientific achievement is the greatest epic the world has ever known,  and like the great national epics of bygone ages, should quicken the  life of the nation by a realization of its powers and a picture of its  possibilities.          CREATIVE CHEMISTRY         La Chimie possede cette faculte creatrice a un degre plus       eminent que les autres sciences, parce qu'elle penetre plus       profondement et atteint jusqu'aux elements naturels des etres.         --_Berthelot_.          I    THREE PERIODS OF PROGRESS      The story of Robinson Crusoe is an allegory of human history. Man is a  castaway upon a desert planet, isolated from other inhabited worlds--if  there be any such--by millions of miles of untraversable space. He is  absolutely dependent upon his own exertions, for this world of his, as  Wells says, has no imports except meteorites and no exports of any kind.  Man has no wrecked ship from a former civilization to draw upon for  tools and weapons, but must utilize as best he may such raw materials as  he can find. In this conquest of nature by man there are three stages  distinguishable:      1. The Appropriative Period    2. The Adaptive Period    3. The Creative Period    These eras overlap, and the human race, or rather its vanguard,  civilized man, may be passing into the third stage in one field of human  endeavor while still lingering in the second or first in some other  respect. But in any particular line this sequence is followed. The  primitive man picks up whatever he can find available for his use. His  successor in the next stage of culture shapes and develops this crude  instrument until it becomes more suitable for his purpose. But in the  course of time man often finds that he can make something new which is  better than anything in nature or naturally produced. The savage  discovers. The barbarian improves. The civilized man invents. The first  finds. The second fashions. The third fabricates.    The primitive man was a troglodyte. He sought shelter in any cave or  crevice that he could find. Later he dug it out to make it more roomy  and piled up stones at the entrance to keep out the wild beasts. This  artificial barricade, this false facade, was gradually extended and  solidified until finally man could build a cave for himself anywhere in  the open field from stones he quarried out of the hill. But man was not  content with such materials and now puts up a building which may be  composed of steel, brick, terra cotta, glass, concrete and plaster, none  of which materials are to be found in nature.    The untutored savage might cross a stream astride a floating tree trunk.  By and by it occurred to him to sit inside the log instead of on it, so  he hollowed it out with fire or flint. Later, much later, he constructed  an ocean liner.    Cain, or whoever it was first slew his brother man, made use of a stone  or stick. Afterward it was found a better weapon could be made by tying  the stone to the end of the stick, and as murder developed into a fine  art the stick was converted into the bow and this into the catapult and  finally into the cannon, while the stone was developed into the high  explosive projectile.

HOPKINSON SMITH      It is the most delightful of French inns, in the quaintest of French  settlements. As you rush by in one of the innumerable trains that pass  it daily, you may catch glimpses of tall trees trailing their branches  in the still stream,--hardly a dozen yards wide,--of flocks of white  ducks paddling together, and of queer punts drawn up on the shelving  shore or tied to soggy, patched-up landing-stairs.    If the sun shines, you can see, now and then, between the trees, a  figure kneeling at the water's edge, bending over a pile of clothes,  washing,--her head bound with a red handkerchief.    If you are quick, the miniature river will open just before you round  the curve, disclosing in the distance groups of willows, and a rickety  foot-bridge perched up on poles to keep it dry. All this you see in a  flash.    But you must stop at the old-fashioned station, within ten minutes of  the Harlem River, cross the road, skirt an old garden bound with a fence  and bursting with flowers, and so pass on through a bare field to the  water's edge, before you catch sight of the cosy little houses lining  the banks, with garden fences cutting into the water, the arbors  covered with tangled vines, and the boats crossing back and forth.    I have a love for the out-of-the-way places of the earth when they  bristle all over with the quaint and the old and the odd, and are mouldy  with the picturesque. But here is an in-the-way place, all sunshine and  shimmer, with never a fringe of mould upon it, and yet you lose your  heart at a glance. It is as charming in its boat life as an old Holland  canal; it is as delightful in its shore life as the Seine; and it is as  picturesque and entrancing in its sylvan beauty as the most exquisite of  English streams.    The thousands of workaday souls who pass this spot daily in their whirl  out and in the great city may catch all these glimpses of shade and  sunlight over the edges of their journals, and any one of them living  near the city's centre, with a stout pair of legs in his knickerbockers  and the breath of the morning in his heart, can reach it afoot any day  before breakfast; and yet not one in a hundred knows that this ideal  nook exists.    Even this small percentage would be apt to tell of the delights of  Devonshire and of the charm of the upper Thames, with its tall rushes  and low-thatched houses and quaint bridges, as if the picturesque ended  there; forgetting that right here at home there wanders many a stream  with its breast all silver that the trees courtesy to as it sings  through meadows waist-high in lush grass,--as exquisite a picture as can  be found this beautiful land over.    So, this being an old tramping-ground of mine, I have left the station  with its noise and dust behind me this lovely morning in June, have  stopped long enough to twist a bunch of sweet peas through the garden  fence, and am standing on the bank waiting for some sign of life at  Madame Laguerre's. I discover that there is no boat on my side of the  stream. But that is of no moment. On the other side, within a biscuit's  toss, so narrow is it, there are two boats; and on the landing-wharf,  which is only a few planks wide, supporting a tumble-down flight of  steps leading to a vine-covered terrace above, rest the oars.    I lay my traps down on the bank and begin at the top of my voice:--    \"Madame Laguerre! Madame Laguerre! Send Lucette with the boat.\"    For a long time there is no response. A young girl drawing water a short  distance below, hearing my cries, says she will come; and some children  above, who know me, begin paddling over. I decline them all. Experience  tells me it is better to wait for madame.    In a few minutes she pushes aside the leaves, peers through, and calls  out:--    \"Ah! it is that horrible painter. Go away! I have nothing for you. You  are hungry again that you come?\"    \"Very, madame. Where is Lucette?\"    \"Lucette! Lucette! It is always Lucette. Lu-c-e-t-t-e!\" This in a shrill  key. \"It is the painter. Come quick.\"    I have known Lucette for years, even when she was a barefooted little  tangle-hair, peeping at me with her great brown eyes from beneath her  ragged straw hat. She wears high-heeled slippers now, and sometimes on  Sundays dainty silk stockings, and her hair is braided down her back,  little French Marguerite that she is, and her hat is never ragged any  more, nor her hair tangled. Her eyes, though, are still the same  velvety, half-drooping eyes, always opening and shutting and never  still.    As she springs into the boat and pulls towards me I note how round and  trim she is, and before we have landed at Madame Laguerre's feet I have  counted up Lucette's birthdays,--those that I know myself,--and find to  my surprise that she must be eighteen. We have always been the best of  friends, Lucette and I, ever since she looked over my shoulder years ago  and watched me dot in the outlines of her boat, with her dog Mustif  sitting demurely in the bow.    Madame, her mother, begins again:--    \"Do you know that it is Saturday that you come again to bother? Now it  will be a _filet_, of course, with mushrooms and tomato salad; and there  are no mushrooms, and no tomatoes, and nothing. You are horrible. Then,  when I get it ready, you say you will come at three. 'Yes, madame; at  three,'--mimicking me,--'sure, very sure.' But it is four, five,  o'clock--and then everything is burned up waiting. Ah! I know you.\"    This goes on always, and has for years. Presently she softens, for she  is the most tender-hearted of women, and would do anything in the world  to please me.    \"But, then, you will be tired, and of course you must have something. I  remember now there is a chicken. How will the chicken do? Oh, the  chicken it is lovely, _charmant_. And some pease--fresh. Monsieur picked  them himself this morning. And some Roquefort, with an olive. Ah! You  leave it to me; but at three--no later--not one minute. _Sacre! Vous  etes le diable!_\"    As we walk under the arbor and by the great trees, towards the cottage,  Lucette following with the oars, I inquire after monsieur, and find that  he is in the city, and very well and very busy, and will return at  sundown. He has a shop of his own in the upper part where he makes  _passe-partouts_. Here, at his home, madame maintains a simple  restaurant for tramps like me.    These delightful people are old friends of mine, Francois Laguerre and  his wife and their only child Lucette. They have lived here for nearly a  quarter of a century. He is a straight, silver-haired old Frenchman of  sixty, who left Paris, between two suns, nearly forty years ago, with a  gendarme close at his heels, a red cockade under his coat, and an  intense hatred in his heart for that \"little nobody,\" Napoleon III.    If you met him on the boulevard you would look for the decoration on his  lapel, remarking to yourself, \"Some retired officer on half pay.\" If you  met him at the railway station opposite, you would say, \"A French  professor returning to his school.\" Both of these surmises are partly  wrong, and both partly right. Monsieur Laguerre has had a history. One  can see by the deep lines in his forehead and by the firm set of his  eyes and mouth that it has been an eventful one.    His wife is a few years his junior, short and stout, and thoroughly  French down to the very toes of her felt slippers. She is devoted to  Francois and Lucette, the best of cooks, and, in spite of her scoldings,  good-nature itself. As soon as she hears me calling, there arise before  her the visions of many delightful dinners prepared for me by her own  hand and ready to the minute--all spoiled by my belated sketches. So  she begins to scold before I am out of the boat or in it, for that  matter.    Across the fence next to Laguerre's lives a _confrere_, a brother exile,  Monsieur Marmosette, who also has a shop in the city, where he carves  fine ivories. Monsieur Marmosette has only one son. He too is named  Francois, after his father's old friend. Farther down on both sides of  the narrow stream front the cottages of other friends, all Frenchmen;  and near the propped-up bridge an Italian who knew Garibaldi burrows in  a low, slanting cabin, which is covered with vines. I remember a dish of  _spaghetti_ under those vines, and a flask of Chianti from its cellar,  all cobwebs and plaited straw, that left a taste of Venice in my mouth  for days.    As there is only the great bridge above, which helps the country road  across the little stream, and the little foot-bridge below, and as there  is no path or road,--all the houses fronting the water,--the Bronx "]]]
