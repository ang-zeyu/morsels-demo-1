And it is only when we can take for granted the existence of  the object painted that it can begin to give us pleasure that is  genuinely artistic, as separated from the interest we feel in symbols.    [Page heading: ANALYSIS OF ENJOYMENT OF PAINTING]    At the risk of seeming to wander off into the boundless domain of  aesthetics, we must stop at this point for a moment to make sure that we  are of one mind regarding the meaning of the phrase \"artistic pleasure,\"  in so far at least as it is used in connection with painting.    What is the point at which ordinary pleasures pass over into the  specific pleasures derived from each one of the arts? Our judgment about  the merits of any given work of art depends to a large extent upon our  answer to this question. Those who have not yet differentiated the  specific pleasures of the art of painting from the pleasures they derive  from the art of literature, will be likely to fall into the error of  judging the picture by its dramatic presentation of a situation or its  rendering of character; will, in short, demand of the painting that it  shall be in the first place a good _illustration_. Those others who seek  in painting what is usually sought in music, the communication of a  pleasurable state of emotion, will prefer pictures which suggest  pleasant associations, nice people, refined amusements, agreeable  landscapes. In many cases this lack of clearness is of comparatively  slight importance, the given picture containing all these  pleasure-giving elements in addition to the qualities peculiar to the  art of painting. But in the case of the Florentines, the distinction is  of vital consequence, for they have been the artists in Europe who have  most resolutely set themselves to work upon the specific problems of the  art of figure-painting, and have neglected, more than any other school,  to call to their aid the secondary pleasures of association. With them  the issue is clear. If we wish to appreciate their merit, we are forced  to disregard the desire for pretty or agreeable types, dramatically  interpreted situations, and, in fact, \"suggestiveness\" of any kind.  Worse still, we must even forego our pleasure in colour, often a  genuinely artistic pleasure, for they never systematically exploited  this element, and in some of their best works the colour is actually  harsh and unpleasant. It was in fact upon form, and form alone, that the  great Florentine masters concentrated their efforts, and we are  consequently forced to the belief that, in their pictures at least, form  is the principal source of our aesthetic enjoyment.    Now in what way, we ask, can form in painting give me a sensation of  pleasure which differs from the ordinary sensations I receive from form?  How is it that an object whose recognition in nature may have given me  no pleasure, becomes, when recognised in a picture, a source of aesthetic  enjoyment, or that recognition pleasurable in nature becomes an enhanced  pleasure the moment it is transferred to art? The answer, I believe,  depends upon the fact that art stimulates to an unwonted activity  psychical processes which are in themselves the source of most (if not  all) of our pleasures, and which here, free from disturbing physical  sensations, never tend to pass over into pain. For instance: I am in  the habit of realising a given object with an intensity that we shall  value as 2. If I suddenly realise this familiar object with an intensity  of 4, I receive the immediate pleasure which accompanies a doubling of  my mental activity. But the pleasure rarely stops here. Those who are  capable of receiving direct pleasure from a work of art, are generally  led on to the further pleasures of self-consciousness. The fact that the  psychical process of recognition goes forward with the unusual intensity  of 4 to 2, overwhelms them with the sense of having twice the capacity  they had credited themselves with: their whole personality is enhanced,  and, being aware that this enhancement is connected with the object in  question, they for some time after take not only an increased interest  in it, but continue to realise it with the new intensity. Precisely this  is what form does in painting: it lends a higher coefficient of reality  to the object represented, with the consequent enjoyment of accelerated  psychical processes, and the exhilarating sense of increased capacity in  the observer. (Hence, by the way, the greater pleasure we take in the  object painted than in itself.)    And it happens thus. We remember that to realise form we must give  tactile values to retinal sensations. Ordinarily we have considerable  difficulty in skimming off these tactile values, and by the time they  have reached our consciousness, they have lost much of their strength.  Obviously, the artist who gives us these values more rapidly than the  object itself gives them, gives us the pleasures consequent upon a more  vivid realisation of the object, and the further pleasures that come  from the sense of greater psychical capacity.    Furthermore, the stimulation of our tactile imagination awakens our  consciousness of the importance of the tactile sense in our physical and  mental functioning, and thus, again, by making us feel better provided  for life than we were aware of being, gives us a heightened sense of  capacity. And this brings us back once more to the statement that the  chief business of the figure painter, as an artist, is to stimulate the  tactile imagination.    The proportions of this small book forbid me to develop further a  theme, the adequate treatment of which would require more than the  entire space at my command. I must be satisfied with the crude and  unillumined exposition given already, allowing myself this further word  only, that I do not mean to imply that we get no pleasure from a picture  except the tactile satisfaction. On the contrary, we get much pleasure  from composition, more from colour, and perhaps more still from  movement, to say nothing of all the possible associative pleasures for  which every work of art is the occasion. What I do wish to say is that  _unless_ it satisfies our tactile imagination, a picture will not exert  the fascination of an ever-heightened reality; first we shall exhaust  its ideas, and then its power of appealing to our emotions, and its  \"beauty\" will not seem more significant at the thousandth look than at  the first.    My need of dwelling upon this subject at all, I must repeat, arises from  the fact that although this principle is important indeed in other  schools, it is all-important in the Florentine school. Without its due  appreciation it would be impossible to do justice to Florentine  painting. We should lose ourselves in admiration of its \"teaching,\" or  perchance of its historical importance--as if historical importance were  synonymous with artistic significance!--but we should never realise what  artistic idea haunted the minds of its great men, and never understand  why at a date so early it became academic.    [Page heading: GIOTTO AND VALUES OF TOUCH]    Let us now turn back to Giotto and see in what way he fulfils the first  condition of painting as an art, which condition, as we agreed, is  somehow to stimulate our tactile imagination. We shall understand this  without difficulty if we cover with the same glance two pictures of  nearly the same subject that hang side by side in the Florence Academy,  one by \"Cimabue,\" and the other by Giotto. The difference is striking,  but it does not consist so much in a difference of pattern and types, as  of realisation. In the \"Cimabue\" we patiently decipher the lines and  colours, and we conclude at last that they were intended to represent a  woman seated, men and angels standing by or kneeling. To recognise these  representations we have had to make many times the effort that the  actual objects would have required, and in consequence our feeling of  capacity has not only not been confirmed, but actually put in question.  With what sense of relief, of rapidly rising vitality, we turn to the  Giotto! Our eyes scarcely have had time to light on it before we realise  it completely--the throne occupying a real space, the Virgin  satisfactorily seated upon it, the angels grouped in rows about it. Our  tactile imagination is put to play immediately. Our palms and fingers  accompany our eyes much more quickly than in presence of real objects,  the sensations varying constantly with the various projections  represented, as of face, torso, knees; confirming in every way our  feeling of capacity for coping with things,--for life, in short. I care  little that the picture endowed with the gift of evoking such feelings  has faults, that the types represented do not correspond to my ideal of  beauty, that the figures are too massive, and almost unarticulated; I  forgive them all, because I have much better to do than to dwell upon  faults.    But how does Giotto accomplish this miracle? With the simplest means,  with almost rudimentary light and shade, and functional line, he  contrives to render, out of all the possible outlines, out of all the  possible variations of light and shade that a given figure may have,  only those that we must isolate for special attention when we are  actually realising it. This determines his types, his schemes of colour,  even his compositions. He aims at types which both in face and figure  are simple, large-boned, and massive,--type"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17412"],[0,"The Bobbsey Twins (#2)"],[1,"good while  I was gone?\" she asked.    \"I guess we tried to be good,\" answered Bert meekly.    \"Freddie's boiler got broke, that's all,\" said Flossie. \"Dinah swept up  the dirt.\"    Before anything more could be said all were in the dining room and Mrs.  Bobbsey was called upon to admire the row of houses. Then the box of  candy was opened and each received a share.    \"Now you had better go out and play,\" said the mother. \"Dinah must set  the table for dinner. But be sure and put on your thick coats. It is  very cold and feels like snow.\"    \"Oh, if only it would snow!\" said Bert. He was anxious to try a sled he  had received the Christmas before.    It was Saturday, with no school, so all of the boys and girls of the  neighborhood were out. Some of the girls were skipping rope, and Nan  joined these, while Bert went off to join a crowd of boys in a game of  football.    \"Let us play horse,\" suggested Freddie to Flossie. They had reins of red  leather, with bells, and Freddie was the horse while his twin sister was  the driver.    \"I'm a bad horse, I'll run away if you don't watch me,\" cautioned  Freddie, and began to prance around wildly, against the grape arbor and  then up against the side fence.    \"Whoa! whoa!\" screamed Flossie, jerking on the reins. \"Whoa, you naughty  horse! If I had a whip, I'd beat you!\"    \"If you did that, I'd kick,\" answered Freddie, and began to kick real  hard into the air. But at last he settled down and ran around the house  just as nicely as any horse could. Then he snorted and ran up to the  water bucket near the barn and Flossie pretended to give him a drink and  some hay, and unharnessed him just as if he was a real steed.    Nan was counting while another girl named Grace Lavine jumped, Grace was  a great jumper and had already passed forty when her mother called to  her from the window.    \"Grace, don't jump so much. You'll get sick.\"    \"Oh, no, I won't,\" returned Grace. She was a headstrong girl and always  wanted her own way.    \"But jumping gave you a headache only last week,\" continued Mrs. Lavine.  \"Now, don't do too much of it,\" and then the lady closed the window and  went back to her interrupted work.    \"Oh, dear, mamma made me trip,\" sighed Grace. \"I don't think that was  fair.\"    \"But your mamma doesn't want you to jump any more,\" put in another girl,  Nellie Parks by name.    \"Oh, she didn't say that. She said not to jump too much.\"    It was now Nan's turn to jump and she went up to twenty-seven and then  tripped. Nellie followed and reached thirty-five. Then came another girl  who jumped to fifty-six.    \"I'm going a hundred this time,\" said Grace, as she skipped into place.    \"Oh, Grace, you had better not!\" cried Nan.    \"You're afraid I'll beat you,\" declared Grace.    \"No, I'm not. But your mamma said----\"    \"I don't care what she said. She didn't forbid my jumping,\" cut in the  obstinate girl. \"Are you going to turn or not?\"    \"Yes, I'll turn,\" replied Nan, and at once the jumping started. Soon  Grace had reached forty. Then came fifty, and then sixty.    \"I do believe she will reach a hundred after all,\" declared Nellie  Parks, a little enviously.    \"I will, if you turn steadily,\" answered Grace, in a panting voice. Her  face was strangely pale.    \"Oh, Grace, hadn't you better stop?\" questioned Nan. She was a little  frightened, but, nevertheless, kept on turning the rope.    \"No!\" puffed Grace. \"Go--go on!\"    She had now reached eighty-five. Nellie Parks was counting:    \"Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety!\" she went  on. \"Ninety-one-, ninety-two----\"    \"No--not so--so fast!\" panted Grace. \"I--I--oh!\"    And then, just as Nellie was counting \"Ninety-seven,\" she sank down in a  heap, with her eyes closed and her face as white as a sheet.    For a moment the other girls looked on in blank wonder, not knowing what  to make of it. Then Nan gave a scream.    \"Oh, girls, she has fainted!\"    \"Perhaps she is dead!\" burst out Nellie Parks. \"And if she is, we killed  her, for we turned the rope!\"    \"Oh, Nellie, please don't say that!\" said Nan. She could scarcely speak  the words.    \"Shall I go and tell Mrs. Lavine?\" asked another girl who stood near.    \"No--yes,\" answered Nan. She was so bewildered she scarcely knew what to  say. \"Oh, isn't it awful!\"    They gathered close around the fallen girl, but nobody dared to touch  her. While they were there, and one had gone to tell Mrs. Lavine, a  gentleman came up. It was Mr. Bobbsey, coming home from the lumber yard  for lunch.    \"What is the trouble?\" he asked, and then saw Grace. \"What happened to  her?\"    \"She was--was jumping rope, and couldn't jump any more,\" sobbed Nan.  \"Oh, papa, she--isn't de--dead, is she?\"    Mr. Bobbsey was startled and with good reason, for he had heard of more  than one little girl dying from too much jumping. He took the limp form  up in his arms and hurried to the Lavine house with it. \"Run and tell  Doctor Briskett,\" he called back to Nan.    The physician mentioned lived but a short block away, and Nan ran as  fast as her feet could carry her. The doctor had just come in from  making his morning calls and had his hat and overcoat still on.    \"Oh, Doctor Briskett, do come at once!\" she sobbed. \"Grace Lavine is  dead, and we did it, turning the rope for her!\"    \"Grace Lavine dead?\" repeated the dumfounded doctor.    \"Yes! yes!\"    \"Where is she?\"    \"Papa just carried her into her house.\"    Without waiting to hear more, Doctor Briskett ran toward the Lavine  residence, around which quite a crowd had now collected. In the crowd  was Bert.    \"Is Grace really dead?\" he asked.    \"I--I--guess so,\" answered Nan. \"Oh, Bert, it's dreadful! I was turning  the rope and she had reached ninety-seven, when all at once she sank  down, and----\" Nan could not go on, but leaned on her twin brother's arm  for support.    \"You girls are crazy to jump rope so much,\" put in a big boy, Danny Rugg  by name. Danny was something of a bully and very few of the girls liked  him.    \"It's no worse than playing football,\" said a big girl.    \"Yes, it is, much worse,\" retorted Danny. \"Rope jumping brings on heart  disease. I heard father tell about it.\"    \"I hope Grace didn't get heart disease,\" sobbed Nan.    \"You turned the rope,\" went on Danny maliciously. \"If she dies, they'll  put you in prison, Nan Bobbsey.\"    \"They shan't do it!\" cried Bert, coming to his sister's rescue. \"I won't  let them.\"    \"Much you can stop 'em, Bert Bobbsey.\"    \"Can't I?\"    \"No, you can't.\"    \"I'll see if I can't,\" answered Bert, and he gave Danny such a look that  the latter edged away, thinking he was going to be attacked.    Doctor Briskett had gone into the house and the crowd hung around  impatiently, waiting for news. The excitement increased, and Mrs.  Bobbsey came forth, followed by Freddie and Flossie, who had just  finished playing horse.    \"Nan, Nan! what can it mean?\" said Mrs. Bobbsey.    \"Oh, mamma!\" murmured Nan, and sank, limp and helpless, into her  mother's arms.    Just then Mr. Bobbsey came forth from the Lavine residence. Seeing his  wife supporting their daughter, he hurried in that direction.    \"Grace is not dead,\" he announced. \"She had a fainting spell, that is  all. But I think after this she had better leave rope skipping alone.\"          CHAPTER III    THE FIRST SNOW STORM      Nan felt greatly relieved to learn that Grace was not dead.    \"Oh, mamma, I am _so_ glad!\" she said, over and over again.    \"I am glad too,\" answered Mrs. Bobbsey. \"Her mamma has told her several  times not to jump so much.\"    \"Yes, I heard her.\" Nan's eyes dropped. \"I was wicked to turn the rope  for her.\"    In the end Nan told her mother the whole story, to which Mrs. Bobbsey  listened very gravely.    \"It was certainly wrong, Nan,\" she said. \"After this I hope my little  girl will try to do better.\"    \"I shall try,\" answered Nan.    It was long after the dinner hour before the excitement died away. Then  it was learned that Grace was resting quietly in an easy chair and the  doctor had ordered that she be kept quiet for several days. She was very  much frightened and had told her parents that she would never jump rope  again.    The time was the fall of the year, and that Saturday evening there was a  feeling of snow in the air stronger than before.    \"Oh, if only it would snow!\" came from Bert, several times. \"I like  winter better than anything.\"    \"I don't,\" answered Nan. \"Think of the nice flowers we have in the  summer.\"    \"You can't have much fun with flowers, Nan.\"    \"Yes, you can. And think of the birds----\"    \"I like the summer,\" piped in Freddie, \"cos then we go to the country  where the cows and the chickens are!\"    \"Yes, and gather the eggs,\" put in Flossie, who had gathered eggs many  times during the summer just past, while on a visit to their Uncle  Daniel Bobbsey's farm at Meadow Brook. All of the Bobbsey children  thought Meadow Brook the finest country place in all the world.    Bert's wish for snow was soon gratified. Sunday morning found it snowing  steadily, the soft flakes coming down silently and covering the ground  to the depth of several inches.    \"Winter has come after all!\" cried the boy. \"Wish it was Monday instead  of Sunday.\"    \"The snow is not quite deep enough for sleighing yet,\" returned his  father.    Despite the storm, all attended church in the morning, and the four  children and Mrs. Bobbsey went to Sunday school in the afternoon. The  lady taught a class of little girls and had Flossie as one of her  pupils.    To the children, traveling back and forth through the snow was great  sport, and Bert couldn't resist the temptation to make several snowballs  and throw them at the other boys. The other boys threw back in return  and Bert's hat was knocked off.    \"Bert, this will not do on Sunday,\" said Mrs. Bobbsey, and there the  snowballing came to an end.    All through that night the snow continued to come down, and on"]]]
