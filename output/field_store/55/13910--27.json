ANIMALS, BIRDS, AND FISHES    BY    DAVID STARR JORDAN, LL.D.      This volume is made up from the writings of naturalists who have told  us of the behavior of animals as they have seen it at first hand and  of the beginnings and the growth of life so far as they know about it.  In selecting these from the wealth of available material the editor  has been guided by this rule: The subject matter must be interesting  to young people; it must be told in a clear and attractive style; and  most important of all, it must deal with actualities. We have seen in  the last few years a marked revival of nature studies. This has led to  a wider range of interest in natural phenomena and in the growth and  ways of animals and plants. If this movement is not to be merely a  passing fad, the element of truthfulness must be constantly insisted  upon. If a clever imagination, or worse, sentimental symbolism, be  substituted for the truth of nature, the value of such studies is  altogether lost.    The essence of character-building lies in action. The chief value of  nature study in character-building is that, like life itself, it  deals with realities. One must in life make his own observations,  frame his own inductions, and apply them in action as he goes along.  The habit of finding out the best thing to do next and then doing it  is the basis of character. Nature-study, if it be genuine, is  essentially doing. To deal with truth is necessary, if we are to know  truth when we see it in action. The rocks and shells, the frogs and  lilies, always tell the absolute truth. Every leaf on the tree is an  original document in botany. When a thousand are used or used up, the  archives of Nature are just as full as ever. By the study of realities  wisdom is built up. In the relations of objects he can touch and move,  the child finds the limitations of his powers, the laws that govern  phenomena, which his own actions must obey. So long as he deals with  realities, these laws stand in their proper relation. \"So simple, so  natural, so true,\" says Agassiz. \"This is the charm of dealing with  nature herself. She brings us back to absolute truth so often as we  wander.\"    So long as a child is led from one reality to another, never lost in  words or abstractions,--so long this natural relation remains. \"What  can I do with it?\" is the beginning of wisdom. \"What is it to me?\" is  the beginning of personal virtue.    By adding near things to near, the child grows in Knowledge.  Knowledge, tested and set in order, is Science. Nature-study is the  beginning of science. It is the science of the child. The \"world as  it is\" is the province of science. In proportion as our actions  conform to the conditions of the world as it is, do we find the world  beautiful, glorious, divine. The truth of the world as it is must be  the final inspiration of art, poetry, and religion. The world, as men  have agreed to say that it is, is quite another matter. The less our  children hear of this, the less they may have to unlearn. Nature  studies have long been valued as \"a means of grace,\" because they  arouse the enthusiasm, the love of work, which belongs to open-eyed  youth. The child blase with moral precepts and irregular conjugations  turns with fresh delight to the unrolling of ferns or the song of  birds.    Nature must be questioned in earnest, or she will not reply. But to  every serious question she will return a serious answer. \"Simple,  natural, and true,\" she tends to create simplicity and truth. Truth  and virtue are but opposite sides of the same shield. As leaves pass  over into flowers, and flowers into fruit, so are wisdom, virtue, and  happiness inseparably related.    This little volume is a contribution to the subject matter of Nature  Study. It is the work of students of nature, and their work is  \"simple, natural, and true,\" in so far as it is represented here.    [Illustration: (Signature) David Starr Jordan]    LELAND STANFORD JR. UNIVERSITY,  CALIFORNIA, _April_ 22, 1902.          A BOOK OF NATURAL HISTORY          THE WONDER OF LIFE    (FROM HIS SCIENCE PRIMER, INTRODUCTION.)    BY PROFESSOR, T. H. HUXLEY.      [Illustration]    Every one has seen a cornfield. If you pluck up one of the innumerable  wheat plants which are fixed in the soil of the field, about harvest  time, you will find that it consists of a stem which ends in a root at  one end and an ear at the other, and that blades or leaves are  attached to the sides of the stem. The ear contains a multitude of  oval grains which are the seeds of the wheat plant. You know that when  these seeds are cleared from the husk or bran in which they are  enveloped, they are ground into fine powder in mills, and that this  powder is the flour of which bread is made. If a handful of flour  mixed with a little cold water is tied up in a coarse cloth bag, and  the bag is then put into a large vessel of water and well kneaded with  the hands, it will become pasty, while the water will become white. If  this water is poured away into another vessel, and the kneading  process continued with some fresh water, the same thing will happen.  But if the operation is repeated the paste will become more and more  sticky, while the water will be rendered less and less white, and at  last will remain colorless. The sticky substance which is thus  obtained by itself is called gluten; in commerce it is the substance  known as maccaroni.    If the water in which the flour has thus been washed is allowed to  stand for a few hours, a white sediment will be found at the bottom of  the vessel, while the fluid above will be clear and may be poured off.  This white sediment consists of minute grains of starch, each of  which, examined with the microscope, will be found to have a  concentrically laminated structure. If the fluid from which the starch  was deposited is now boiled it will become turbid, just as white of  egg diluted with water does when it is boiled, and eventually a  whitish lumpy substance will collect at the bottom of the vessel. This  substance is called vegetable albumin.    Besides the albumin, the gluten, and the starch, other substances  about which this rough method of analysis gives us no information, are  contained in the wheat grain. For example, there is woody matter or  cellulose, and a certain quantity of sugar and fat. It would be  possible to obtain a substance similar to albumin, starch, saccharine,  and fatty matters, and cellulose, by treating the stem, leaves, and  root in a similar fashion, but the cellulose would be in far larger  proportion. Straw, in fact, which consists of the dry stem and leaves  of the wheat plant, is almost wholly made up of cellulose. Besides  this, however, it contains a certain proportion of mineral bodies,  among them, pure flint or silica; and, if you should ever see a wheat  rick burnt, you will find more or less "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18281"],[0,"An Account of the Proceedings on the Trial of Susan B.

U.S. District Attorney.    For the Defendant:              HON. HENRY R. SELDEN.            JOHN VAN VOORHIS, ESQ.      Tried at Canandaigua. Tuesday and Wednesday, June 17th and 18th, 1873,  before Hon. Ward Hunt, and a jury.    Jury impanneled at 2:30 P.M.    MR. CROWLEY opened the case as follows:    _May it please the Court and Gentlemen of the Jury_:    On the 5th of November, 1872, there was held in this State, as well as  in other States of the Union, a general election for different officers,  and among those, for candidates to represent several districts of this  State in the Congress of the United States. The defendant, Miss Susan B.  Anthony, at that time resided in the city of Rochester, in the county of  Monroe, Northern District of New York, and upon the 5th day of November,  1872, she voted for a representative in the Congress of the United  States, to represent the 29th Congressional District of this State, and  also for a representative at large for the State of New York, to  represent the State in the Congress of the United States. At that time  she was a woman. I suppose there will be no question about that. The  question in this case, if there be a question of fact about it at all,  will, in my judgment, be rather a question of law than one of fact. I  suppose that there will be no question of fact, substantially, in the  case when all of the evidence is out, and it will be for you to decide  under the charge of his honor, the Judge, whether or not the defendant  committed the offence of voting for a representative in Congress upon  that occasion. We think, on the part of the Government, that there is no  question about it either one way or the other, neither a question of  fact, nor a question of law, and that whatever Miss Anthony's intentions  may have been--whether they were good or otherwise--she did not have a  right to vote upon that question, and if she did vote without having a  lawful right to vote, then there is no question but what she is guilty  of violating a law of the United States in that behalf enacted by the  Congress of the United States.    We don't claim in this case, gentlemen, that Miss Anthony is of that  class of people who go about \"repeating.\" We don't claim that she went  from place to place for the purpose of offering her vote. But we do  claim that upon the 5th of November, 1872, she voted, and whether she  believed that she had a right to vote or not, it being a question of  law, that she is within the Statute.    Congress in 1870 passed the following statute: (Reads 19th Section of  the Act of 1870, page 144, 16th statutes at large.)    It is not necessary for me, gentlemen, at this stage of the case, to  state all the facts which will be proven on the part of the Government.  I shall leave that to be shown by the evidence and by the witnesses, and  if any question of law shall arise his Honor will undoubtedly give you  instructions as he shall deem proper.    _Conceded_, that on the 5th day of November, 1872, Miss Susan B. Anthony  was a woman.    BEVERLY W. JONES, a witness, called in behalf of the United States,  having been duly sworn, testified as follows:    _Examined_ by Mr. Crowley:    Q. Mr. Jones, where do you reside?    A. 8th ward, Rochester.    Q. Where were you living on the 5th of November, 1872?    A. Same place.    Q. Do you know the defendant, Miss Susan B. Anthony?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. In what capacity were you acting upon that day, if any, in relation  to elections?    A. Inspector of election.    Q. Into how many election districts is the 8th ward divided, if it  contains more than one?    A. Two, sir.    Q. In what election district were you inspector of elections?    A. The first district.    Q. Who were inspectors with you?    A. Edwin T. Marsh and William B. Hall.    Q. Had the Board of Inspectors been regularly organized?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. Upon the 5th day of November, did the defendant, Susan B. Anthony,  vote in the first election district of the 8th ward of the city of  Rochester?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. Did you see her vote?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. Will you state to the jury what tickets she voted, whether State,  Assembly, Congress and Electoral?    Objected to as calling for a conclusion.    Q. State what tickets she voted, if you know, Mr. Jones?    A. If I recollect right she voted the Electoral ticket, Congressional  ticket, State ticket, and Assembly ticket.    Q. Was there an election for Member of Congress for that district and  for Representative at Large in Congress, for the State of New York, held  on the 5th of November, in the city of Rochester?    A. I think there was; yes, sir.    Q. In what Congressional District was the city of Rochester at the time?    A. The 29th.    Q. Did you receive the tickets from Miss Anthony?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. What did you do with them when you received them?    A. Put them in the separate boxes where they belonged.    Q. State to the jury whether you had separate boxes for the several  tickets voted in that election district?    A. Yes, sir; we had.    Q. Was Miss Anthony challenged upon that occasion?    A. Yes, sir--no; not on that day she wasn't.    Q. She was not challenged on the day she voted?    A. No, sir.    _Cross-Examination_ by Judge Selden:    Q. Prior to the election, was there a registry of voters in that  district made?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. Was you one of the officers engaged in making that registry?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. When the registry was being made did Miss Anthony appear before the  Board of Registry and claim to be registered as a voter?    A. She did.    Q. Was there any objection made, or any doubt raised as to her right to  vote?    A. There was.    Q. On what ground?    A. On the ground that the Constitution of the State of New York did not  allow women to vote.    Q. What was the defect in her right to vote as a citizen?    A. She was not a male citizen.    Q. That she was a woman?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. Did the Board consider that and decide that she was entitled to  register?    Objected to. Objection overruled.    Q. Did the Board consider the question of her right to registry, and  decide that she was entitled to registry as a voter?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. And she was registered accordingly?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. When she offered her vote, was the same objection brought up in the  Board of Inspectors, or question made of her right to vote as a woman?    A. She was challenged previous to election day.    Q. It was canvassed previous to election day between them?    A. Yes, sir; she was challenged on the second day of registering names.    Q. At the time of the registry, when her name was registered, was the  Supervisor of Election present at the Board?    A. He was.    Q. Was he consulted upon the question of whether she was entitled to  registry, or did he express an opinion on the subject to the inspectors?    MR. CROWLEY: I submit that it is of no consequence whether he did or  not.    JUDGE SELDEN: He was the Government Supervisor under this act of  Congress.    MR. CROWLEY: The Board of"]]]
