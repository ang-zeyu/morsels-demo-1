Lovely and languid thou,  Sleep still upon thy brow,      Dreams in thine eyes.  From out thy garment flows  Fragrance of many a rose--      Airs of delight  Caught in the moonlit hours  Lying among the flowers      Through the long night.  Look on my face how pale!  Will naught my love avail?      Naught my desire?  Hold it as gold that is  Cleansed of impurities      Tried in the fire.  Pity my heart distrest,  Caught by that loveliest      Tress of thine hair,  So that I fear the shade  Even by thine eyebrows made      O'er eyes so fair.    ABRU.          II.      Thou, Sorrow, wilt keep and wilt cherish the memory of me      Long after my death,  For thou dwelt at my heart, and my blood nourished thee,      Thou wert warmed by my breath.    My heart has disgraced me by clamour and wailing for years      And tossing in pain,  Mine eyes lost their honour by shedding these torrents of tears      Like fast-falling rain.    O Wind of Disaster, destroy not the home of my heart      With the blasts of thine ire,  For there I have kindled to burn in a chamber apart      My Lamp of Desire.    AMIR.          III.      Had I control o'er her, the dear Tormentor,      Then might I rest;  I cannot govern her, nor can I master      The heart within my breast.    I cast myself upon the ground in anguish      Wounded and sore,  Yet longed to have two hearts that she might pierce them,      That I might suffer more.    Utterly from her heart hath she erased me,      No marks remain,  So there shall be no grave from which my ashes      May greet her steps again.    O cruel One, when once your glances smote me,      Why turn your head?  It were more merciful to let their arrows      Pierce me and strike me dead.    No tomb, Amir, could give my dust oblivion,      No rest was there:  And when they told her I had died of sorrow,      She did not know--nor care.    AMIR.          IV.      This Life is less than shadows; if thou yearn      To know and find the God thou worshippest,  From all the varying shows of being turn      To that true Life which is unmanifest.    Beware, O travellers, dangerous is Life's Way      With lures that call, illusion that deceives,  For set to snare the voyagers that stray      Are fortresses of robbers, lairs of thieves.    The seer's eyes look on the cup of wine      And say--We need no more thy drunkenness;  An exaltation that is more divine,      Another inspiration, we possess.    O praise not peacock youth; it flits away      And leaves us but the ashes of regret,  A disappointed heart, a memory,      An empty foolish pride that lingers yet.    Upon the path, Amir, we journey far,      Weary the road where mankind wandereth;  O tell me, does it lead through Life's bazar,      Or is it the dread gate and house of Death?    AMIR.          V.      Here can my heart no longer rest;      It tells my happy destiny,  Towards Medina lies my quest,      The Holy Prophet summons me.    I should not marvel if for flight      Upon my shoulders wings should start,  My body is so gay and light      With this new gladness in my heart.    My weary patience nears its end;      Unresting heart, that yearns and loves,  Convey me far to meet my friend      Within Medina's garden groves.    My spirit shall not faint nor tire,      Although by many tender bands  My country holds me, I desire      The journey through the desert sands.    By day and night forever now      I burn in Love's hot furnace breath,  Although there gather on my brow      The cold and heavy sweats of death.    And ever in my home in Hind      At dawn's first light, at evenfall,  I hear upon the desert wind      The Prophet of Arabia call.    AMIR.          VI.      The light is in mine eyes,  Within my heart I feel Thy joy arise,  From gate to inmost shrine  This palace of my soul is utterly Thine.    O longing seeking eyes,  He comes to you in many a varied guise,  If Him you cannot find  The shame be yours, O eyes that are so blind.    I as His mirror glow  Bearing His image in my heart, and know  That glowing clear in His  The image of my heart reflected is.    O drink the Wine of Love,  And in the Assembly of Enlightened move,  Let not the darkness dim  Fall like a curtain 'twixt thy soul and Him.    Who gives away his soul  Forgets his petty self and wins the whole,  Losing himself outright  He finds himself in the Eternal Light.    Crazy art thou, Amir,  To wait before His gate in hope and fear;  For never in thy pain  Shall He yield up thy ravished heart again.    AMIR.          VII.

Esthetic features of form are, in origin  and manifestation, related to both function and construction; color  and design, to construction mainly. In the following study separate  sections are given to each of these topics.    It is fortunate perhaps that in this work I am restricted to the  products of rather primitive stages of culture, as I have thus to deal  with a limited number of uses, simple processes, and simple shapes. In  the advanced stages of art we encounter complex phenomena, processes,  and conditions, the accumulation of ages, through which no broad light  can fall upon the field of vision.    In America there is a vast body of primitive, indigenous art having no  parallel in the world. Uncontaminated by contact with the complex  conditions of civilized art, it offers the best possible facilities  for the study of the fundamental principles of esthetic development.    The laws of evolution correspond closely in all art, and, if once  rightly interpreted in the incipient stage of a single, homogeneous  culture, are traceable with comparative ease through all the  succeeding stages of civilization.      FORM IN TEXTILE ART.    Form in the textile art, as in all other useful arts, is  fundamentally, although not exclusively, the resultant or expression  of function, but at the same time it is further than in other shaping  arts from expressing the whole of function. Such is the pliability of  a large portion of textile products--as, for example, nets, garments,  and hangings--that the shapes assumed are variable, and, therefore,  when not distended or for some purpose folded or draped, the articles  are without esthetic value or interest. The more rigid objects, in  common with the individuals of other useful arts, while their shape  still accords with their functional office, exhibit attributes of form  generally recognized as pleasing to the mind, which are expressed by  the terms grace, elegance, symmetry, and the like. Such attributes are  not separable from functional attributes, but originate and exist  conjointly with them.    In addition to these features of form we observe others of a more  decidedly superfunctional character, added manifestly for the purpose  of enhancing the appearance.    In very primitive times when a utensil is produced functional ideas  predominate, and there is, perhaps, so far as its artificial  characters are concerned, a minimum of comeliness. But as the ages  pass by essential features are refined and elements of beauty are  added and emphasized. In riper culture the growing pressure of  esthetic desire leads to the addition of many superficial  modifications whose chief office is to please the fancy. In periods of  deadened sensibility or even through the incompetence of individual  artists in any period, such features may be ill chosen and  erroneously applied, interfering with construction and use, and thus  violating well founded and generally accepted canons of taste. In  respect to primitive works we may distinguish four steps in the  acquisition of esthetic features of form, three of which are normal,  the fourth abnormal: First, we have that in which functional  characters alone are considered, any element of beauty, whether due to  the artist's hand or to the accidents of material, construction, or  model, being purely adventitious; second, that in which the necessary  features of the utensil appear to have experienced the supervision of  taste, edges being rounded, curves refined, and symmetry perfected;  third, that in which the functionally perfect object, just described,  undergoes further variations of contour, adding to variety, unity,  &c., thus enhancing beauty without interfering with serviceability;  and, fourth, that in which, under abnormal influences, beauty is  sought at the sacrifice of functional and constructive perfection.    [Illustration: FIG. 286. Mat or tray exhibiting a minimum of esthetic  attributes of form. Moki work--1/8.]    The exact relations of the various classes of forces and phenomena  pertaining to this theme may be more fully elucidated by the aid of  illustrations. Woven mats, in early use by many tribes of men and  originating in the attempt to combine leaves, vines, and branches for  purposes of comfort, are flat because of function, the degree of  flatness depending upon the size of filaments and mode of combination;  and in outline they are irregular, square, round, or oval, as a result  of many causes and influences, embracing use, construction, material,  models, &c. A close approach to symmetry, where not imposed by some of  the above mentioned agencies, is probably due to esthetic tendencies  on the part of the artist. The esthetic interest attaching to such a  shape cannot be great, unless perhaps it be regarded, as all  individuals and classes may be regarded, in its possible relations to  preceding, associated, and succeeding forms of art. The varied  features observed upon the surface, the colors and patterns (Fig.  286), pertain to design rather than to form and will receive attention  in the proper place.    [Illustration: FIG. 287. Tray having decided esthetic attributes of  form. Obtained from the Apache--1/2.]    In point of contour the basket tray shown in Fig. 287 has a somewhat  more decided claim upon esthetic attention than the preceding, as the  curves exhibited mark a step of progress in complexity and grace. How  much of this is due to intention and how much to technical perfection  must remain in doubt. In work so perfect we are wont, however  unwarrantably, to recognize the influence of taste.    [Illustration: FIG. 288. Pyriform water vessel used by the Piute  Indians--1/8.]    A third example--presented in Fig. 288--illustrates an advanced stage  in the art of basketry and exhibits a highly specialized shape. The  forces and influences concerned in its evolution may be analyzed as  follows: A primal origin in function and a final adaptation to a  special function, the carrying and storing of water; a contour full to  give capacity, narrow above for safety, and pointed below that it may  be set in sand; curves kept within certain bounds by the limitations  of construction; and a goodly share of variety, symmetry, and grace,  the result to a certain undetermined extent of the esthetic tendencies  of the artist's mind. In regard to the last point there is generally  in forms so simple an element of uncertainty; but many examples may be  found in which there is positive evidence of the existence of a strong  desire on the part of the primitive basketmaker to enhance beauty of  form. It will be observed that the textile materials and construction  do not lend themselves freely to minuteness in detail or to complexity  of outline, especially in those small ways in which beauty is most  readily expressed.    Modifications of a decidedly esthetic character are generally  suggested to the primitive mind by some functional, constructive, or  accidental feature which may with ease be turned in the new direction.  In the vessel presented in Fig. 289--the work of Alaskan Indians--the  margin is varied by altering the relations of the three marginal turns  of the coil, producing a scalloped effect. This is without reference  to use, is uncalled for in construction, and hence is, in all  probability, the direct result of esthetic tendencies. Other and much  more elaborate examples may be found in the basketry of almost all  countries.    [Illustration: FIG. 289. Vessel with esthetic characters of form. Work  of the Yakama--1/4.]    In the pursuit of this class of enrichment there is occasionally  noticeable a tendency to overload the subject with extraneous details.  This is not apt to occur, however, in the indigenous practice of an  art, but comes more frequently from a loss of equilibrium or balance  in motives or desires, caused by untoward exotic influence. When,  through suggestions derived from contact with civilized art, the  savage undertakes to secure all the grace and complexity observed in  the works of more cultured peoples, he does so at the expense of  construction and adaptability to use. An example of such work is  presented in Fig. 290, a weak, useless, and wholly vicious piece of  basketry. Other equally meretricious pieces represent goblets,  bottles, and tea pots. They are the work of the Indians of the  northwest coast and are executed in the neatest possible manner,  bearing evidence of the existence of cultivated taste.    [Illustration: FIG. 290. Basket made under foreign influence,  construction and use being sacrificed to fancied beauty--1/3.]    It appears from the preceding analyses that _form_ in this art is not  sufficiently sensitive to receive impressions readily from the  delicate touch of esthetic fingers; besides, there are peculiar  difficulties in the way of detecting traces of the presence and  supervision of taste. The inherent morphologic forces of the art are  strong and stubborn and tend to produce the precise classes of results  that we, at this stage of culture, are inclined to attribute to  esthetic influence. If, in the making of a vessel, the demands of use  are fully satisfied, if construction is perfect of its kind, if  materials are uniformly suitable, and if models are not absolutely  bad, it follows that the result must necessarily possess in a high  degree those very attributes that all agree are pleasing to the eye.    In a primitive water vessel function gives a full outline, as capacity  is a prime consideration; convenience of use calls for a narrow neck  and a conical base; construction and materials unite to impose certain  limitations to curves and their combinations, from which the artist  cannot readily free himself. Models furnished by nature, as they are  usually graceful, do not interfere with the preceding agencies, and  all these forces united tend to give symmetry, grace, and the unity  that"]]]
