The elder Marvell  belonged, from the beginning to the end of his useful and even heroic  life, to the Reformed Church of England, or, as his son puts it, \"a  conformist to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of England, though  I confess none of the most over-running and eager in them.\" The younger  Marvell, with one boyish interval, belonged all through his life to the  paternal school of religious thought.    Fuller's account of the elder Marvell is too good to be passed over:--       \"He afterwards became Minister at Hull, where for his lifetime he was     well beloved. Most facetious in discourse, yet grave in his carriage,     a most excellent preacher who, like a good husband, never broached     what he had new brewed, but preached what he had pre-studied some     competent time before. Insomuch that he was wont to say that he would     cross the common proverb which called Saturday the working-day and     Monday the holyday of preachers. It happened that Anno Dom. 1640,     Jan. 23, crossing Humber in a Barrow boat, the same was sandwarpt,     and he was drowned therein (with Mrs. Skinner, daughter to Sir Edward     Coke, a very religious gentlewoman) by the carelessness, not to say     drunkenness of the boatmen, to the great grief of all good men. His     excellent comment upon St. Peter is daily desired and expected, if     the envy and covetousness of private persons _for their own use_     deprive not the public of the benefit thereof.\"[6:1]    This good man, to whom perhaps, remembering the date of his death, the  words may apply, _Tu vero felix non vitae tantum claritate sed etiam  opportunitate mortis_, was married at Cherry Burton, on the 22nd of  October 1612, to Anne Pease, a member of a family destined to become  widely known throughout the north of England. Of this marriage there  were five children, all born at Winestead, viz. three daughters, Anne,  Mary, and Elizabeth, and two sons, Andrew and John, the latter of whom  died a year after his birth, and was buried at Winestead on the 20th  September 1624.    The three daughters married respectively James Blaydes of Sutton,  Yorkshire, on the 29th of December 1633; Edmund Popple, afterwards  Sheriff of Hull, on the 18th of August 1636; and Robert More. Anne's  eldest son, Joseph Blaydes, was Mayor of Hull in 1702, having married  the daughter of a preceding Mayor in 1698. The descendants of this  branch still flourish. The Popples also had children, one of whom,  William Popple, was a correspondent of his uncle the poet's, and a  merchant of repute, who became in 1696 Secretary to the Board of Trade,  and the friend of the most famous man who ever sat at the table of that  Board, John Locke. A son of this William Popple led a very comfortable  eighteenth-century life, which is in strong contrast with that of his  grand-uncle, for, having entered the Cofferers' Office about 1730, he  was made seven years later Solicitor and Clerk of the Reports to the  Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, and in 1745 became in  succession to a relative, one Alured Popple, Governor of the Bermudas, a  post he retained until his death, which occurred not        \"Where the remote Bermudas ride       In the ocean's bosom unespied,\"    but at his house in Hampstead. So well placed and idle a gentleman was  almost bound to be a bad poet and worse dramatist, and this William  Popple was both.    Marvell's third sister, Elizabeth, does not seem to have had issue, a  certain Thomas More, or Moore, a Fellow of Magdalen College, Cambridge,  whose name occurs in family records, being her stepson.    In the latter part of 1624 the elder Marvell resigned the living of  Winestead, and took up the duties of schoolmaster and lecturer, or  preacher, at Hull. Important duties they were, for the old Grammar  School of Hull dates back to 1486, and may boast of a long career of  usefulness, never having fallen into that condition of decay and  disrepute from which so many similar endowments have been of late years  rescued by the beneficent and, of course, abused action of the Charity  Commissioners. Andrew Marvell the elder succeeded to and was succeeded  by eminent headmasters. Trinity Church, where the poet's father preached  on Sundays to crowded and interested congregations, was then what it  still is, though restored by Scott, one of the great churches in the  north of England.    The Rev. Andrew Marvell made his mark upon Hull. Mr. Grosart, who lacked  nothing but the curb upon a too exuberant vocabulary, a little less  enthusiasm and a great deal more discretion, to be a model editor, tells  us in his invaluable edition of _The Complete Works in Verse and Prose  of Andrew Marvell, M.P._,[8:1] that he had read a number of the elder  Marvell's manuscripts, consisting of sermons and miscellaneous papers,  from which Mr. Grosart proceeds:--       \"I gather three things.       \"(1) That he was a man of a very brave, fearlessly outspoken     character. Some of his practical applications in his sermons before     the Magistrates are daring in their directness of reproof, and     melting in their wistfulness of entreaty.       \"(2) That he was a well-read man. His Sermons are as full of     classical and patristic allusions and pat sayings from the most     occult literatures as even Bishop Andrewes.       \"(3) That he was a man of tireless activity. Besides the two offices     named, he became head of one of the Great Hospitals of the Town     (Charter House), and in an address to the Governors placed before     them a prescient and statesmanlike plan for the better management of     its revenues, and for the foundation of a Free Public Library to be     accessible to all.\"    When at a later day, and in the midst of a fierce controversy, Andrew  Marvell wrote of the clergy as \"the reserve of our Christianity,\" he  doubtless had such men as his father in his mind and memory.    It was at the old Grammar School of Hull, and with his father as his  _Orbilius_, that Marvell was initiated into the mysteries of the Latin  grammar, and was, as he tells us, put to his          \"Montibus, inquit, erunt; et erant submontibus illis;        Risit Atlantiades; et me mihi, perfide, prodis?        Me mihi prodis? ait.       \"For as I remember this scanning was a liberal art that we learn'd at     Grammar School, and to scan verses as he does the Author's prose     before we did or were obliged to understand them.\"[8:2]    Irrational methods have often amazingly good results, and the Hull  Grammar School provided its head-master's only son with the rudiments of  learning, thus enabling him to become in after years what John Milton  himself, the author of that terrible _Treatise on Education_ addressed  to Mr. Hartlibb, affirmed Andrew Marvell to be in a written testimonial,  \"a scholar, and well-read in the Latin and Greek authors.\"    Attached to the Grammar School there was \"a great garden,\" renowned for  its wall-fruit and flowers; so by leaving Winestead behind, our  \"garden-poet,\" that was to be, was not deprived of inspiration.    Apart from these meagre facts, we know nothing of Marvell's boyhood at  Hull. His clerical foe, Dr. Parker, afterwards Bishop of Oxford, writes  contemptuously of \"an hunger-starved whelp of a country vicar,\" and in  another passage, which undoubtedly refers to Marvell, he speaks of \"an  unhappy education among Boatswains and Cabin-boys,\" whose unsavoury  phrases, he goes on to suggest, Marvell picked up in his childhood. But  truth need not be looked for in controversial pages. The best argument  for a married clergy is to be found, for Englishmen at all events, in  the sixty-seven volumes of the _Dictionary of National Biography_, where  are recorded the services rendered to religion, philosophy, poetry,  justice, and the empire by the \"whelps\" of many a country vicar.  Parsons' wives may sometimes be trying and hard to explain, but an  England without the sons of her clergy would be shorn of half her glory.    Marvell's boyhood seems to have been surrounded with the things that  most make for a child's happiness. A sensible, affectionate, humorous,  religious father, occupying a position of authority, and greatly  respected, a mother and three elder sisters to make much of his bright  wit and early adventures, a comfortable yet simple home, and an  atmosphere of piety, learning, and good fellowship. What more is wanted,  or can be desired? The \"Boatswains\" and \"Cabin-boys\" of Bishop Parker's  fancy were in the neighbourhood, no doubt, and as stray companions for a  half-holiday must have had their attractions; but it is unnecessary to  attribute Andrew Marvell's style in controversy to his early  acquaintance with a sea-faring population, for he is far more likely to  have picked it up from his great friend and colleague, the author of  _Paradise Lost_.    Marvell's school education over, he went up to Cambridge, not to his  father's old college, but to the more splendid foundation of Trinity.  About the date of his matriculation there is a doubt. In Wood's _Athenae  Oxonienses_ there is a note to the effect that Marvell was admitted \"in  matriculam Acad. Cant. Coll. Trin.\" on the 14th of December 1633, when  the boy was but twelve years old. Dr. Lort, a famous master of Trinity  in his day, writing in November 1765 to Captain Edward Thompson, of whom  more later on, told the captain that until 1635 there was no register of  admissions of ordinary students, or pensioners, as they are called, but  only a register of Fellows and Foundation Scholars, and in this  last-named register Marvell's name appears as a Scholar sworn and  admitted on the 13th of April 1638. As, however, Marvell took his B.A.  degree in 1639, he must have been in residence long before April 1638.  Probably Marvell went to Trinity about 1635, just before the register of  pensioners was begun, as a pensioner, becoming a Scholar in 1638, and  taking his degree in 1639."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17396"],[0,"The Secret Garden (#2)"],[1,"nothing but themselves. But if every one had got well again, surely some  one would remember and come to look for her.    But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more  and more silent. She heard something rustling on the matting and when  she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her  with eyes like jewels. She was not frightened, because he was a harmless  little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out  of the room. He slipped under the door as she watched him.    \"How queer and quiet it is,\" she said. \"It sounds as if there was no one  in the bungalow but me and the snake.\"    Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on  the veranda. They were men's footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow  and talked in low voices. No one went to meet or speak to them and they  seemed to open doors and look into rooms.    \"What desolation!\" she heard one voice say. \"That pretty, pretty woman!  I suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no one ever  saw her.\"    Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door  a few minutes later. She looked an ugly, cross little thing and was  frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully  neglected. The first man who came in was a large officer she had once  seen talking to her father. He looked tired and troubled, but when he  saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back.    \"Barney!\" he cried out. \"There is a child here! A child alone! In a  place like this! Mercy on us, who is she!\"    \"I am Mary Lennox,\" the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly.  She thought the man was very rude to call her father's bungalow \"A place  like this!\" \"I fell asleep when every one had the cholera and I have  only just wakened up. Why does nobody come?\"    \"It is the child no one ever saw!\" exclaimed the man, turning to his  companions. \"She has actually been forgotten!\"    \"Why was I forgotten?\" Mary said, stamping her foot. \"Why does nobody  come?\"    The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly. Mary even  thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.    \"Poor little kid!\" he said. \"There is nobody left to come.\"    It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had  neither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away  in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also had  left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even  remembering that there was a Missie Sahib. That was why the place was so  quiet. It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and  the little rustling snake.          CHAPTER II    MISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY      Mary had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought  her very pretty, but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely  have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was  gone. She did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a  self-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she had  always done. If she had been older she would no doubt have been very  anxious at being left alone in the world, but she was very young, and as  she had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be.  What she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to  nice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her  Ayah and the other native servants had done.    She knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman's house  where she was taken at first. She did not want to stay. The English  clergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age and  they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toys  from each other. Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was so  disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play  with her. By the second day they had given her a nickname which made her  furious.    It was Basil who thought of it first. Basil was a little boy with  impudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose and Mary hated him. She was  playing by herself under a tree, just as she had been playing the day  the cholera broke out. She was making heaps of earth and paths for a  garden and Basil came and stood near to watch her. Presently he got  rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.    \"Why don't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?\"  he said. \"There in the middle,\" and he leaned over her to point.    \"Go away!\" cried Mary. \"I don't want boys. Go away!\"    For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to tease. He was  always teasing his sisters. He danced round and round her and made faces  and sang and laughed.              \"Mistress Mary, quite contrary,                How does your garden grow?             With silver bells, and cockle shells,                And marigolds all in a row.\"    He sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and the  crosser Mary got, the more they sang \"Mistress Mary, quite contrary\";  and after that as long as she stayed with them they called her \"Mistress  Mary Quite Contrary\" when they spoke of her to each other, and often  when they spoke to her.    \"You are going to be sent home,\" Basil said to her, \"at the end of the  week. And we're glad of it.\"    \"I am glad of it, too,\" answered Mary. \"Where is home?\"    \"She doesn't know where home is!\" said Basil, with seven-year-old scorn.  \"It's England, of course. Our grandmama lives there and our sister Mabel  was sent to her last year. You are not going to your grandmama. You have  none. You are going to your uncle. His name is Mr. Archibald Craven.\"    \"I don't know anything about him,\" snapped Mary.    \"I know you don't,\" Basil answered. \"You don't know anything. Girls  never do. I heard father and mother talking about him. He lives in a  great, big, desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him.  He's so cross he won't let them, and they wouldn't come if he would let  them. He's a hunchback, and he's horrid.\"    \"I don't believe you,\" said Mary; and she turned her back and stuck her  fingers in her ears, because she would not listen any more.    But she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawford  told her that night that she was going to sail away to England in a few  days and go to her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived at  Misselthwaite Manor, she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested  that they did not know what to think about her. They tried to be kind to  her, but she only turned her face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted to  kiss her, and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her  shoulder.    \"She is such a plain child,\" Mrs. Crawford said pityingly, afterward.  \"And her mother was such a pretty creature. She had a very pretty  manner, too, and Mary has the most unattractive ways I ever saw in a  child. The children call her 'Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,' and though  it's naughty of them, one can't help understanding it.\"    \"Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty  manners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some pretty  ways too. It is very sad, now the poor beautiful thing is gone, to  remember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all.\"    \"I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,\" sighed Mrs. Crawford.  \"When her Ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the little  thing. Think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone in  that deserted bungalow. Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped out of his  skin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in the  middle of the room.\"    Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer's  wife, who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding-school.  She was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl, and was  rather glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Craven  sent to meet her, in London. The woman was his housekeeper at  Misselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Medlock. She was a stout  woman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes. She wore a very purple  dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with  purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved her  head. Mary did not like her at all, but as she very seldom liked people  there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was very evident  Mrs. Medlock did not think much of her.    \"My word! she's a plain little piece of goods!\" she said. \"And we'd  heard that her mother was a beauty. She hasn't handed much of it down,  has she, ma'am?\"    \"Perhaps she will improve as she grows older,\" the officer's wife said  good-naturedly. \"If she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression,  her features are rather good. Children alter so much.\"    \"She'll have to alter a good deal,\" answered Mrs. Medlock. \"And there's  nothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite--if you ask me!\"    They thought Mary was not listening because she was standing a little  apart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to. She  was watching the passing buses and cabs, and people, but she heard quite  well and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he lived  in. What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like? What was a  hunchback? She had never seen one. Perhaps there were none in India.    Since she had been living in other people's houses and had had no Ayah,  she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new  to her. She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to  any one even when her father and mother had been alive. Other children  seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemed  to really be any one's little girl. She had had servants, and food "]]]
