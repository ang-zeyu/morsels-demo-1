The density  of the cotton bales produced is about 45 lb. per cubic foot, 400 lb.  measuring a little under 9 cubic feet for shipment. In the case of  jute or jute roots, the same weight occupies 10 cubic feet on an  average. But rapid as this press is in action, the necessities of  recent business in India have called for still more expeditious  working, and to meet this demand Mr. Watson produced his compound  press, in which the economy of time is carried to its utmost  development. By the addition of a second pair of long-stroke rams the  output of the press has been trebled, being raised to 80 bales per  hour. To effect this, there is one pair of powerful rams, as in the  press just described, but two pairs of the long-stroke rams. Further,  each pair of the small-diameter rams is fitted with two boxes, one of  which is always being filled while the other is being pressed. The  rams in rising compress the material into a small cell or box,  situated above the box in which raw cotton is thrown. On the top of  the ram head there is a loose lashing plate, which, at the finish of  the action of the rams, is locked in the cell by bolts actuated by a  suitable locking gear. While in this cell the bale has the lashing  ropes put round it, and then it is placed under the large rams for the  final squeeze, during which the ties or ropes are permanently secured.  Thus neither of the small presses has even to wait while its box is  being filled, or while the previously pressed bale is being lashed.  Even in the large press, when the ties are finally fastened, the time  occupied does not exceed three-quarters of a minute, and is often much  less.    [Illustration: COMPOUND HYDRAULIC PRESS. FIGS. 3 and 4.]    This press is shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The small rams are arranged at  either side of the large ones, which, in this case, are not inverted.  To each of the smaller presses there is a pair of boxes mounted on a  vertical column, around which they can revolve to bring either box  over the rain head. When the left hand rams rise, the material is  delivered into the cell, D, which previously has had its doors (Fig.  4) closed. To permit of the cell, D, being moved out of the way, it is  mounted so that it can revolve on one of the columns of the main  press, first into the position shown at B (Fig. 4), and afterward to C  (Fig. 3). While at D, the bale in the cell (called from its  construction a revolver) is partly lashed, the ties or ropes being put  into position. It is then rotated until it comes over the large rams,  where the bale is still more compressed and secured.    It must be admitted that this press provides for the greatest possible  economy of time, and for the largest output, for the capital employed,  which can be attained. The rams and the men are constantly in action,  and not a single moment is lost. For filling each box 78 seconds are  allowed, and there is ample time for the preliminary lashing.    [Illustration: COMPOUND HYDRAULIC PRESS. FIGS. 5 and 6.]    Figs. 5 and 6 show a modification of this press, designed to turn out  sixty bales per hour. It has only one set of long-stroke rams, with  three revolvers. The bale receives its preliminary lashing while in  the position, B (Fig. 6). Fifty-three seconds are available for  filling the box, and the same time for the preliminary lashing. It is  found, however, that three-quarters of a minute is sufficient for the  complete hooping of a bale.    [Illustration: COMPOUND HYDRAULIC PRESS. FIGS. 7 and 8.]    Figs. 7 and 8 show a similar press intended for jute pressing. This  has only one box, which is fixed, as the material has to be packed in  an orderly manner. Its speed is sixty bales an hour.--_Engineering._           *       *       *       *       *          JET PROPELLERS.--HYDRAULIC PROPULSION OF VESSELS.      Certain mechanical devices appear to exercise a remarkable influence  on some minds, and engineers are blamed for not adopting them, in no  very measured terms in some cases. It is not in any way necessary that  these devices should have been invented by the men who advocate their  adoption, in order to secure that advocacy. The intrinsic attractions  of the scheme suffice to evoke eulogy; and engineers sometimes find it  very difficult to make those who believe in such devices understand  that there are valid reasons standing in the way of their adoption.  One such device is hydraulic propulsion. A correspondent in a recent  impression suggested its immediate and extended use in yachts at all  events, and we willingly published his letter, because the system does  no doubt lend itself very freely to adoption for a particular class of  yachts, namely, those provided with auxiliary power only. But because  this is the case it must not be assumed that the jet propeller is  better than screw or paddle-wheel propulsion; and it is just as well,  before, correspondence extends further, that we should explain why and  in what way it is not satisfactory. The arguments to be urged in favor  of hydraulic propulsion are many and cogent; but it will not fail to  strike our readers, we think, that all these arguments refer, not to  the efficiency of the system, but to its convenience. A ship with a  hydraulic propeller can sail without let or hindrance; a powerful pump  is provided, which will deal with an enormous leak, and so on. If all  the good things which hydraulic propulsion promises could be had  combined with a fair efficiency, then the days of the screw propeller  and the paddle wheel would be numbered; but the efficiency of the  hydraulic propeller is very low, and we hope to make the reason why it  is low intelligible to readers who are ignorant of mathematics. Those  who are not ignorant of them will find no difficulty in applying them  to what we have to say, and arriving at similar conclusions in a  different way.    Professor Greenhill has advanced in our pages a new theory of the  screw propeller. As the series of papers in which he puts forward his  theory is not complete, we shall not in any way criticise it; but we  must point out that the view he takes is not that taken by other  writers and reasoners on the subject, and in any case it will not  apply to hydraulic propulsion. For these reasons we shall adhere in  what we are about to advance to the propositions laid down by  Professor Rankine, as the exponent of the hitherto received theory of  the whole subject. When a screw or paddle wheel is put in motion, a  body of water is driven astern and the ship is driven ahead. Water,  from its excessive mobility, is incapable of giving any resistance to  the screw or paddle save that due to its inertia. If, for example, we  conceive of the existence of a sea without any inertia, then we can  readily understand that the water composing such a sea would offer no  resistance to being pushed astern by paddle or screw. When a gun is  fired, the weapon moves in one direction--this is called its  recoil--while the shot moves in another direction. The same  principal--_pace_ Professor Greenhill--operates to cause the movement  of a ship. The water is driven in one direction, the ship in another.  Now, Professor Rankine has laid down the proposition that, other  things being equal, that propeller must be most efficient which sends  the largest quantity of water astern at the slowest speed. This is a  very important proposition, and it should be fully grasped and  understood in all its bearings. The reason why of it is very simple.  Returning for a moment to our gun, we see that a certain amount of  work is done on it in causing it to recoil; but the whole of the work  done by the powder is, other things being equal, a constant quantity.  The sum of the work done on the shot and on the gun in causing their  motions is equal to the energy expended by the powder, consequently  the more work we do on the gun, the less is available for the shot. It  can be shown that, if the gun weighed no more than the shot, when the  charge was ignited the gun and the shot would proceed in opposite  directions at similar velocities--very much less than that which the  shot would have had had the gun been held fast, and very much greater  than the gun would have had if its weight were, as is usually the  case, much in excess of that of the shot. In like manner, part of the  work of a steam engine is done in driving the ship ahead, and part in  pushing the water astern. An increase in the weight of water is  equivalent to an augmentation in the weight of our gun and its  carriage--of all that, in short, takes part in the recoil.    But, it will be urged, it is just the same thing to drive a large body  of water astern at a slow speed as a small body at a high speed. This  is the favorite fallacy of the advocates of hydraulic propulsion. The  turbine or centrifugal pump put into the ship drives astern through  the nozzles at each side a comparatively small body of water at a very  high velocity. In some early experiments we believe that a velocity of  88 ft. per second, or 60 miles an hour, was maintained. A screw  propeller operating with an enormously larger blade area than any pump  can have, drives astern at very slow speed a vast weight of water at  every revolution; therefore, unless it can be shown that the result is  the same whether we use high speed and small quantities or low speed  and large quantities, the case of the hydraulic propeller is hopeless.  But this cannot be done. It is a fact, on the contrary, that the work  wasted on the water increases in a very rapid ratio with its speed.  The work stored up in the moving water is expressed in foot pounds by  the formula      W v squared / 2g    where W stands for the weight of the water, and v for its velocity.  But the work stored in the water must have been derived from the  engine; consequently the waste of engine power augments, not in the  ratio of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16363"],[0,"The New York Times Current History of the European War, Vol 1, Issue 4, January (#2)"],[1,"Cambrai-Le Cateau Road south  of La Chaprie. In this position the division rendered great help to the  effective retirement of the Second and First Corps to the new position.    Although the troops had been ordered to occupy the Cambrai-Le  Cateau-Landrecies position, and the ground had, during the 25th, been  partially prepared and intrenched, I had grave doubts--owing to the  information I had received as to the accumulating strength of the enemy  against me--as to the wisdom of standing there to fight.    Having regard to the continued retirement of the French on my right, my  exposed left flank, the tendency of the enemy's western corps (II.) to  envelop me, and, more than all, the exhausted condition of the troops, I  determined to make a great effort to continue the retreat till I could  put some substantial obstacle, such as the Somme or the Oise, between my  troops and the enemy, and afford the former some opportunity of rest and  reorganization. Orders were, therefore, sent to the corps commanders to  continue their retreat as soon as they possibly could toward the general  line Vermand-St. Quentin-Ribemont.    The cavalry, under Gen. Allenby, were ordered to cover the retirement.    Throughout the 25th and far into the evening, the First Corps continued  its march on Landrecies, following the road along the eastern border of  the Foret de Mormal, and arrived at Landrecies about 10 o'clock. I had  intended that the corps should come further west so as to fill up the  gap between Le Cateau and Landrecies, but the men were exhausted and  could not get further in without rest.    The enemy, however, would not allow them this rest, and about 9:30 P.M.  a report was received that the Fourth Guards Brigade in Landrecies was  heavily attacked by troops of the Ninth German Army Corps, who were  coming through the forest on the north of the town. This brigade fought  most gallantly, and caused the enemy to suffer tremendous loss in  issuing from the forest into the narrow streets of the town. This loss  has been estimated from reliable sources at from 700 to 1,000. At the  same time information reached me from Sir Douglas Haig that his First  Division was also heavily engaged south and east of Maroilles. I sent  urgent messages to the commander of the two French reserve divisions on  my right to come up to the assistance of the First Corps, which they  eventually did. Partly owing to this assistance, but mainly to the  skillful manner in which Sir Douglas Haig extricated his corps from an  exceptionally difficult position in the darkness of the night, they were  able at dawn to resume their march south toward Wassigny on Guise.    By about 6 P.M. the Second Corps had got into position with their right  on Le Cateau, their left in the neighborhood of Caudry, and the line of  defense was continued thence by the Fourth Division toward Seranvillers,  the left being thrown back.    During the fighting on the 24th and 25th the cavalry became a good deal  scattered, but by the early morning of the 26th Gen, Allenby had  succeeded in concentrating two brigades to the south of Cambrai.    The Fourth Division was placed under the orders of the general officer  commanding the Second Army Corps.    On the 24th the French cavalry corps, consisting of three divisions  under Gen. Sordet, had been in billets north of Avesnes. On my way back  from Bavai, which was my \"Poste de Commandement\" during the fighting of  the 23d and 24th, I visited Gen. Sordet, and earnestly requested his  co-operation and support. He promised to obtain sanction from his army  commander to act on my left flank, but said that his horses were too  tired to move before the next day. Although he rendered me valuable  assistance later on in the course of the retirement, he was unable for  the reasons given to afford me any support on the most critical day of  all, viz., the 26th.    At daybreak it became apparent that the enemy was throwing the bulk of  his strength against the left of the position occupied by the Second  Corps and the Fourth Division.    At this time the guns of four German army corps were in position against  them, and Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien reported to me that he judged it  impossible to continue his retirement at daybreak (as ordered) in face  of such an attack.    I sent him orders to use his utmost endeavors to break off the action  and retire at the earliest possible moment, as it was impossible for me  to send him any support, the First Corps being at the moment incapable  of movement.    The French cavalry corps, under Gen. Sordet, was coming up on our left  rear early in the morning, and I sent an urgent message to him to do his  utmost to come up and support the retirement of my left flank; but owing  to the fatigue of his horses he found himself unable to intervene in any  way.    There had been no time to intrench the position properly, but the troops  showed a magnificent front to the terrible fire which confronted them.    The artillery, although outmatched by at least four to one, made a  splendid fight, and inflicted heavy losses on their opponents.    [Illustration: Map 1.--Showing the early stages of the retreat from  Mons, Aug. 22 to Sept. 1.]    At length it became apparent that, if complete annihilation was to be  avoided, a retirement must be attempted; and the order was given to  commence it about 3:30 P.M. The movement was covered with the most  devoted intrepidity and determination by the artillery, which had itself  suffered heavily, and the fine work done by the cavalry in the further  retreat from the position assisted materially in the final completion of  this most difficult and dangerous operation.    Fortunately the enemy had himself suffered too heavily to engage in an  energetic pursuit.    I cannot close the brief account of this glorious stand of the British  troops without putting on record my deep appreciation of the valuable  services rendered by Gen. Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien.    I say without hesitation that the saving of the left wing of the army  under my command on the morning of the 26th August could never have been  accomplished unless a commander of rare and unusual coolness,  intrepidity, and determination had been present to personally conduct  the operation.    The retreat was continued far into the night of the 26th and through the  27th and 28th, on which date the troops halted on the line  Noyon-Chauny-La Fere, having then thrown off the weight of the enemy's  pursuit.    On the 27th and 28th I was much indebted to Gen. Sordet and the French  cavalry division which he commands for materially assisting my  retirement and successfully driving back some of the enemy on Cambrai.    Gen. D'Amade also, with the Sixty-first and Sixty-second French Reserve  Divisions, moved down from the neighborhood of Arras on the enemy's  right flank and took much pressure off the rear of the British forces.    This closes the period covering the heavy fighting which commenced at  Mons on Sunday afternoon, 23d August, and which really constituted a  four days' battle.    At this point, therefore, I propose to close the present dispatch.    I deeply deplore the very serious losses which the British forces have  suffered in this great battle; but they were inevitable in view of the  fact that the British Army--only two days after a concentration by  rail--was called upon to withstand a vigorous attack of five German army  corps.    It is impossible for me to speak too highly of the skill evinced by the  two general officers commanding army corps; the self-sacrificing and  devoted exertions of their staffs; the direction of the troops by  divisional, brigade, and regimental leaders; the command of the smaller  units by their officers; and the magnificent fighting spirit displayed  by non-commissioned officers and men.    I wish particularly to bring to your Lordship's notice the admirable  work done by the Royal Flying Corps under Sir David Henderson. Their  skill, energy, and perseverance [Transcriber: original 'perseverence']  have been beyond all praise. They have furnished me with the most  complete and accurate information, which has been of incalculable value  in the conduct of the operations. Fired at constantly both by friend and  foe, and not hesitating to fly in every kind of weather, they have  remained undaunted throughout.    Further, by actually fighting in the air, they have succeeded in  destroying five of the enemy's machines.    I wish to acknowledge with deep gratitude the incalculable assistance I  received from the General and Personal Staffs at Headquarters during  this trying period.    Lieut. Gen. Sir Archibald Murray, Chief of the General Staff; Major Gen.  Wilson, Sub-Chief of the General Staff; and all under them have worked  day and night unceasingly with the utmost skill, self-sacrifice, and  devotion; and the same acknowledgment is due by me to Brig. Gen. Hon. W.  Lambton, my Military Secretary, and the personal Staff.    In such operations as I have described the work of the Quartermaster  General is of an extremely onerous nature. Major Gen. Sir William  Robertson has met what appeared to be almost insuperable difficulties  with his characteristic energy, skill, and determination; and it is  largely owing to his exertions that the hardships and sufferings of the  troops--inseparable from such operations--were not much greater.
