The practice of religion involves as a first principle a loving,  compassionate heart for all creatures.--Fo-pen-hing-tsih-king.    Shall we in worshipping slay that which hath life?

How can a system requiring the infliction of misery on other beings be  called a religious system?... To seek a good by doing an evil is  surely no safe plan.--Fo-pen-hing-tsih-king.        Unto the dumb lips of his flock he lent      Sad pleading words, showing how man, who prays      For mercy to the gods, is merciless.    --Sir Edwin Arnold.

These  windows were wholly composed of stained glass, engraved with every  imaginable fantastic design--imps, satyrs, dragons, witches,  queer-shaped trees, hands, eyes, circles, triangles and cats.    \"The towers, half included in the building, were completely circular  within, and contained the winding stairs of the mansion; and whoever  ascended them when a storm was raging seemed rising by a whirlwind to  the clouds.    \"In the upper rooms even the wildest screams of the hurricane were  drowned in the rattling clamour of the assaulted casements. When a gale  of wind took the building in front, it rocked it to the foundations,  and, at such times, threatened its instant demolition.    \"Midway between the towers there stood forth a heavy stone porch with a  Gothic gateway, surmounted by a battlemented parapet, made gable  fashion, the apex of which was garnished by a pair of dolphins, rampant  and antagonistic, whose corkscrew tails seemed contorted--especially at  night--by the last agonies of rage convulsed. The porch doors stood  open, except in tremendous weather; the inner ones were regularly shut  and barred after all who entered. They led into a wide vaulted and lofty  hall, the walls of which were decorated with faded tapestry, that rose,  and fell, and rustled in the most mysterious fashion every time there  was the suspicion--and often barely the suspicion--of a breeze.    \"Interspersed with the tapestry--and in great contrast to its  antiquity--were quite modern and very ordinary portraits of my family.  The general fittings and furniture, both of the hall and house, were  sombre and handsome--truss-beams, corbels, girders and panels were of  the blackest oak; and the general effect of all this, augmented, if  anything, by the windows, which were too high and narrow to admit of  much light, was much the same as that produced by the interior of a  subterranean chapel or charnel house.    \"From the hall proceeded doorways and passages, more than my memory can  now particularize. Of these portals, one at each end conducted to the  tower stairs, others to reception rooms and domestic offices.    \"The whole of the house being too large for us, only one wing--the right  and newer of the two--was occupied, the other was unfurnished, and  generally shut up. I say generally because there were times when either  my mother or father--the servants never ventured there--forgot to lock  the doors, and the handles yielding to my daring fingers, I  surreptitiously crept in.    \"Everywhere--even in daylight, even on the sunniest of mornings--were  dark shadows that hung around the ingles and recesses of the rooms, the  deep cupboards, the passages, and silent, winding staircases.    \"There was one corridor--long, low, vaulted--where these shadows  assembled in particular. I can see them now, as I saw them then, as they  have come to me many times in my dreams, grouped about the doorways,  flitting to and fro on the bare, dismal boards, and congregated in  menacing clusters at the head of the sepulchral staircase leading to the  cellars. Generally, and excepting at times when the weather was  particularly violent, the silence here was so emphatic that I could  never feel it was altogether natural, but rather that it was assumed  especially for my benefit--to intimidate me. If I moved, if I coughed,  almost if I breathed, the whole passage was filled with hoarse  reverberating echoes, that, in my affrighted ears, appeared to terminate  in a series of mirthless, malevolent chuckles. Once, when fascinated  beyond control, I stole on tiptoe along the passage, momentarily  expecting a door to fly open and something grim and horrible to pounce  out on me, I was brought to a standstill by a loud, clanging noise, as  if a pail or some such utensil were set down very roughly on a stone  floor. Then there was the sound of rushing footsteps and of someone  hastily ascending the cellar staircase. In fearful anticipation as to  what I should see--for there was something in the sounds that told me  they were not made by anything human--I stood in the middle of the  passage and stared. Up, up, up they came, until I saw the dark,  indefinite shape of something very horrid, but which I could not--I dare  not--define. It was accompanied by the clanging of a pail. I tried to  scream, but my tongue cleaving to the roof of my mouth prevented my  uttering a syllable, and when I essayed to move, I found I was  temporarily paralysed. The thing came rushing down on me. I grew icy  cold all over, and when it was within a few feet of me, my horror was so  great, I fainted.    \"On recovering consciousness, it was some minutes before I summoned up  courage to open my eyes, but when I did so, they alighted on nothing but  the empty passage--the thing had disappeared.    \"On another occasion, when I was clandestinely paying a visit to the  unused wing, and was in the act of mounting one of the staircases  leading from the corridor, I have just described, to the first floor,  there was the sound of a furious scuffle overhead, and something dashed  down the stairs past me. I instinctively looked up, and there, glaring  down at me from over the balustrade, was a very white face. It was that  of a man, but very badly proportioned--the forehead being low and  receding, and the rest of the face too long and narrow. The crown rose  to a kind of peak, the ears were pointed and set very low down and far  back. The mouth was very cruel and thin-lipped; the teeth were yellow  and uneven. There was no hair on the face, but that on the head was red  and matted. The eyes were obliquely set, pale blue, and full of an  expression so absolutely malignant that every atom of blood in my veins  seemed to congeal as I met their gaze. I could not clearly see the body  of the thing, as it was hazy and indistinct, but the impression I got of  it was that it was clad in some sort of tight-fitting, fantastic  garment. As the landing was in semi-darkness, and the face at all events  was most startlingly visible, I concluded it brought with it a light of  its own, though there was none of that lurid glow attached to it, which  I subsequently learned is almost inseparable from spirit phenomena seen  under similar conditions.    \"For some seconds, I was too overcome with terror to move, but my  faculties at length reasserting themselves, I turned round and flew to  the other wing of the house with the utmost precipitation.    \"One would have thought that after these experiences nothing would have  induced me to have run the risk of another such encounter, yet only a  few days after the incident of the head, I was again impelled by a  fascination I could not withstand to visit the same quarters. In sickly  anticipation of what my eyes would alight on, I stole to the foot of the  staircase and peeped cautiously up. To my infinite joy there was nothing  there but a bright patch of sunshine, that, in the most unusual fashion,  had forced its way through from one of the slits of windows near at  hand.    \"After gazing at it long enough to assure myself it was only sunshine, I  quitted the spot, and proceeded on my way down the vaulted corridor.  Just as I was passing one of the doors, it opened. I stopped--terrified.  What could it be? Bit by bit, inch by inch, I watched the gap slowly  widen. At last, just as I felt I must either go mad or die, something  appeared--and, to my utter astonishment, it was a big, black cat!  Limping painfully, it came towards me with a curious, gliding motion,  and I perceived with a thrill of horror that it had been very cruelly  maltreated. One of its eyes looked as if it had been gouged out--its  ears were lacerated, whilst the paw of one of its hind-legs had either  been torn or hacked off. As I drew back from it, it made a feeble and  pathetic effort to reach me and rub itself against my legs, as is the  way with cats, but in so doing it fell down, and uttering a half purr,  half gurgle, vanished--seeming to sink through the hard oak boards.    \"That evening my youngest brother met with an accident in the barn at  the back of the house, and died. Though I did not then associate his  death with the apparition of the cat, the latter shocked me much, for I  was extremely fond of animals. I did not dare venture in the wing again  for nearly two years.    \"When next I did so, it was early one June morning--between five and  six, and none of the family, saving my father, who was out in the fields  looking after his men, were as yet up. I explored the dreaded corridor  and staircase, and was crossing the floor of one of the rooms I had  hitherto regarded as immune from ghostly influences, when there was an  icy rush of wind, the door behind me slammed to violently, and a heavy  object struck me with great force in the hollow of my back. With a cry  of surprise and agony I turned sharply round, and there, lying on the  floor, stretched out in the last convulsions of death, was the big black  cat, maimed and bleeding as it had been on the previous occasion. How I  got out of the room I don't recollect. I was too horror-stricken to know  exactly what I was doing, but I distinctly remember that, as I tugged  the door open, there was a low, gleeful chuckle, and something slipped  by me and disappeared in the direction of the corridor. At noon that day  my mother had a seizure of apoplexy, and died at midnight.    \"Again there was a lapse of years--this time nearly four--when, sent on  an errand for my father, I turned the key of one of the doors leading  into the empty wing, and once again found myself within the haunted  precincts. All was just as it had been on the occasion of my last  visit--gloom, stillness and cobwebs reigned everywhere, whilst  permeating the atmosphere was a feeling of intense sadness and  depression.    \"I did what was required of me as"]]]
