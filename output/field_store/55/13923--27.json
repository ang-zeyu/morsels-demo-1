The process, albeit necessary, was not altogether a pleasant one.    To understand Ingred's perplexities we must give a brief account of the  fortunes of her family up to the time this story begins. Mr. Saxon was  an architect, who had made a good connection in the town of Grovebury.  Here he had designed and built for himself a very beautiful house, and  had liberally entertained his own and his children's friends. When war  broke out, he had been amongst the first to volunteer for his country's  service, and, as a further act of patriotism, he and his wife had  decided to offer the use of \"Rotherwood\" for a Red Cross Hospital. The  three boys were then at school, Egbert and Athelstane at Winchester, and  Hereward at a preparatory school; so, storing the furniture, Mrs. Saxon  moved into rooms with Quenrede and Ingred, who were attending the girls'  college in Grovebury as day boarders. For the whole period of the war  this arrangement had continued; Rotherwood was given over to the wounded  soldiers, and Mrs. Saxon herself worked as one of their most devoted  nurses.    In course of time Egbert and Athelstane had also joined the army, and  with three of her menkind at the front, their mother had been more than  ever glad to fill up at the hospital the hours when her girls were  absent from her at school. Then came the Armistice, and the blessed  knowledge that, though not yet home again, the dear ones were no longer  in danger. By April the Red Cross had finished its work in Grovebury;  the remaining patients regretfully departed, the wards were dismantled  of their beds, and Rotherwood was handed back to its rightful owners.    Naturally it needed much renovation and decorating before it was again  fit for a private residence, and paperers and painters had been busy  there for many weeks. They had only just removed the ladders by the  middle of July.    It was nearly August before Mr. Saxon, Egbert, and Athelstane were  finally demobilized, and they had gone straight to Lynstones to join the  rest of the family at the farmhouse rooms. What was to happen after the  delirious joy of the holiday was over, Ingred did not know. She had  several times mentioned to her mother the prospect of their return to  Rotherwood, but Mrs. Saxon had always evaded the subject, saying: \"Wait  till Daddy comes back!\" and the welcoming of their three heroes had  seemed a matter of such paramount importance that in comparison with it  even the question of their beloved Rotherwood might stand aside.    The Saxons were a particularly united family, tremendously proud of one  another, and interested in each other's doings. Their name bespoke their  old English origin, which (except in the case of Ingred) was further  vouched for by their blue eyes, fair skins, and flaxen hair. Egbert and  Athelstane were strapping young fellows of six feet, and  thirteen-year-old Hereward was taller already than Ingred. Quenrede,  immensely proud of her quaint Saxon name, and not at all pleased that  the family generally shortened it to Queenie, had just left school, and  had turned up her long fair pigtail, put on a grown-up and rather  condescending manner, powdered the tip of her classic little nose, and  was extremely particular about the cut of her skirts and the fit of her  suede shoes. It was a grievance to Quenrede that, as she expressed it,  she had \"missed the war.\" She had longed to go out to France and drive  an ambulance, or to whirl over English roads on a motorcycle, buying up  hay for the Government, or to assist in training horses, or to help in  some other patriotic job of an equally interesting and exciting  character.    \"It's _too_ bad that just when I'm old enough all the jolly things are  closed to women!\" she groused. \"If Mother had only let me leave school a  year ago, I'd at least have had three months' fun. Life's going to be  very slow now. There's nothing sporty to do at all!\"    Ingred, the youngest but one, and fifteen on her last birthday, was the  only dark member of the fair Saxon family. At present she was not nearly  so good-looking as pretty Quenrede; her mouth was a trifle heavy and her  cheeks lacked color; but her eyes had depths that were not seen in her  sister's, and her thick brown hair fell far below her waist. She would  gladly have exchanged it for the lint-white locks of Hereward.    \"Queenie was always chosen for a fairy at school plays,\" she grumbled,  \"and they never would have me, though her dresses would have come in for  me so beautifully. I don't see why some fairies shouldn't have dark  hair! And it was just as bad when we acted _The Merchant of Venice_.  Miss Carter gave 'Portia' to Francie Hall, and made me take 'Jessica,'  and Francie was a perfect stick, and spoilt the whole thing! Next time,  I declare I'll bargain to wear a golden wig, and see what happens.\"    Ingred had been educated at Grovebury College since the morning when, a  fat little person of five, she had taken her place in the Kindergarten.  She and Quenrede had always been favorites in the school. In pre-war  days they had been allowed to give delightful parties at Rotherwood to  their form-mates, and though that had not been possible during the last  five years, everybody knew that their beautiful home had been lent to  the Red Cross, and admired their patriotism in thus giving it for the  service of the nation. From Avis's remarks that afternoon it was evident  that the girls at the college expected the Saxons to return immediately  to Rotherwood, and were looking forward to being invited to  entertainments there during the coming autumn and winter. Ingred had  contrived to parry her friend's interested questions, but she felt the  time had come when she must be prepared to give some definite answer to  those who inquired about their future plans. She managed to catch her  mother alone next morning for a quiet chat.    \"Mumsie, dear,\" she began. \"I've been wanting to ask you this--are we  going back to Rotherwood after the holidays?\"    Mrs. Saxon folded up her sewing, put her thimble and scissors away in  her work-basket, and leaned her elbow on the arm of the garden seat as  if prepared for conversation.    \"And I've been wanting to talk to you about this, Ingred. Shall you be  very disappointed when I tell you 'No'?\"    \"Oh, Muvvie!\" Ingred's tone was agonized.    \"It can't be helped, little woman! It can't indeed! I think you're old  enough now to understand if I explain. You know this war has hit a great  many people very hard. There has been a sort of general financial  see-saw; some have made large fortunes, but others have lost them. We  come in the latter list. When your father went out to France, he had to  leave his profession to take care of itself, and other architects have  stepped in and gained the commissions that used to come to his office.  It may take him a long while to pull his connection together again, and  the time of waiting will be one of much anxiety for him. Then, most of  our investments, which used to pay such good dividends, are worth hardly  anything now, and only bring us in a pittance compared with former  years. Instead of being rich people, we shall have to be very careful  indeed to make ends meet. To return to Rotherwood is utterly out of the  question, and with the price of everything doubled and trebled, and our  income in the inverse ratio, it is impossible to keep up so big an  establishment nowadays.\"    \"Where are we going to live, then?\" asked Ingred in a strangled voice.    \"At the bungalow that Daddy built on the moors. Fortunately the tenant  was leaving, and we had not let it to any one else. In present  circumstances it will suit us very well. Athelstane is to be entered in  the medical school at Birkshaw; he can ride over every day on the  motor-bicycle. We had hoped to send him to study in London, but that's  only one of the many plans that have 'gane agley'.\"    \"Are Hereward and I to go in to Grovebury every day?\"    \"Hereward can manage it all right, but I shall arrange for you to be a  weekly boarder at the new hostel. You can come home from Friday to  Monday. Now, don't cry about it, childie!\" as a big tear splashed down  Ingred's dress. \"After all, we've much to be thankful for. If we had  lost Father, or Egbert, or Athelstane out in France we might indeed  grieve. So long as we have each other we've got the best thing in life,  and we must all cling together as a family, and help one another on.  Cheer up!\"    \"It will be simply h--h--h--hateful to go back to school this term, and  not live at R--r--r--rotherwood!\" sobbed Ingred.    Her mother patted the dark head that rested against her knee.    \"Poor little woman! Remember it's just as hard for all the rest of us.  We've each got a burden to carry at present. Suppose we see who can be  pluckiest over it. We're fighting fortune now, instead of the Hun, and  we must show her a brave face. Won't you march with the family regiment,  and keep the colors flying?\"    \"I'll try,\" said Ingred, scrubbing her eyes with her  pocket-handkerchief.          CHAPTER II    Opening Day      The Girls' College at Grovebury, under its able head-mistress, Miss  Burd, had made itself quite a name in the neighborhood. The governors,  realizing that it was outgrowing its old premises, decided to erect  others, and had put up a handsome building in a good situation near the  Abbey. No sooner was the last tile laid on the roof, however, than war  broke out, and the new school was immediately commandeered by the  Government as a recruiting office, and it had been kept for that purpose  until after the Armistice.    The girls considered it a very great grievance to be obliged to remain  cramped so long in their old college. The foundation stone of the new  building had been laid by Queen Mary herself, and they thought the  Government might have fixed upon some"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18525"],[0,"On the Trail: An Outdoor Book for Girls (#2)"],[1,"tonic life of the wild. You may not know it,  many do not, but there is a part of your nature that only the wild can  reach, satisfy, and develop. The much-housed, overheated, overdressed,  and over-entertained life of most girls is artificial, and if one does  not turn away from and leave it for a while, one also becomes greatly  artificial and must go through life not knowing the joy, the strength,  the poise that real outdoor life can give.    What is it about a true woodsman that instantly compels our respect,  that sets him apart from the men who might be of his class in village or  town and puts him in a class by himself, though he may be exteriorly  rough and have little or no book education? The real Adirondack or the  North Woods guide, alert, clean-limbed, clear-eyed, hard-muscled,  bearing his pack-basket or duffel-bag on his back, doing all the hard  work of the camp, never loses his poise or the simple dignity which he  shares with all the things of the wild. It is bred in him, is a part of  himself and the life he leads. He is as conscious of his superior  knowledge of the woods as an astronomer is of his knowledge of the  stars, and patiently tolerates the ignorance and awkwardness of the  \"tenderfoot\" from the city. Only a keen sense of humor can make this  toleration possible, for I have seen things done by a city-dweller at  camp that would enrage a woodsman, unless the irresistibly funny side of  it made him laugh his inward laugh that seldom reaches the surface.    To live for a while in the wild strengthens the muscles of your mind as  well as of your body. Flabby thoughts and flabby muscles depart together  and are replaced by enthusiasm and vigor of purpose, by strength of limb  and chest and back. To _have_ seems not so desirable as to _be_. When  you have once come into sympathy with this world of the wild--which  holds our cultivated, artificial world in the hollow of its hand and  gives it life--new joy, good, wholesome, heartfelt joy, will well up  within you. New and absorbing interests will claim your attention. You  will breathe deeper, stand straighter. The small, petty things of life  will lose their seeming importance and great things will look larger and  infinitely more worth while. You will know that the woods, the fields,  the streams and great waters bear wonderful messages for you, and,  little by little, you will learn to read them.    The majority of people who visit the up-to-date hotels of the  Adirondacks, which their wily proprietors call camps, may think they see  the wild and are living in it. But for them it is only a big  picnic-ground through which they rush with unseeing eyes and whose  cloisters they invade with unfeeling hearts, seemingly for the one  purpose of building a fire, cooking their lunch, eating it, and then  hurrying back to the comforts of the hotel and the gayety of hotel life.    [Illustration: One can generally pass around obstructions like this on  the trail.]    At their careless and noisy approach the forest suddenly withdraws  itself into its deep reserve and reveals no secrets. It is as if they  entered an empty house and passed through deserted rooms, but all the  time the intruders are stealthily watched by unseen, hostile, or  frightened eyes. Every form of moving life is stilled and magically  fades into its background. The tawny rabbit halts amid the dry leaves of  a fallen tree. No one sees it. The sinuous weasel slips silently under a  rock by the side of the trail and is unnoticed. The mother grouse  crouches low amid the underbrush and her little ones follow her example,  but the careless company has no time to observe and drifts quickly by.  Only the irrepressible red squirrel might be seen, but isn't, when he  loses his balance and drops to a lower branch in his efforts to miss  nothing of the excitement of the invasion.    This is not romance, it is truth. To think sentimentally about nature,  to sit by a babbling brook and try to put your supposed feelings into  verse, will not help you to know the wild. The only way to cultivate the  sympathy and understanding which will enable you to feel its  heart-beats, is to go to it humbly, ready to see the wonders it can  show; ready to appreciate and love its beauties and ready to meet on  friendly and cordial terms the animal life whose home it is. The wild  world is, indeed, a wonderful world; how wonderful and interesting we  learn only by degrees and actual experience. It is free, but not  lawless; to enter it fully we must obey these laws which are slowly and  silently impressed upon us. It is a wholesome, life-giving, inspiring  world, and when you have learned to conform to its rules you are met on  every hand by friendly messengers to guide you and teach you the ways of  the wild: wild birds, wild fruits and plants, and gentle, furtive, wild  animals. You cannot put their messages into words, but you can feel  them; and then, suddenly, you no longer care for soft cushions and rugs,  for shaded lamps, dainty fare and finery, for paved streets and concrete  walks. You want to plant your feet upon the earth in its natural state,  however rugged or boggy it may be. You want your cushions to be of the  soft moss-beds of the piny woods, and, with the unparalleled sauce of a  healthy, hearty appetite, you want to eat your dinner out of doors,  cooked over the outdoor fire, and to drink water from a birch-bark cup,  brought cool and dripping from the bubbling spring.    You want, oh! how you want to sleep on a springy bed of balsam boughs,  wrapped in soft, warm, woollen blankets with the sweet night air of all  outdoors to breathe while you sleep. You want your flower-garden, not  with great and gorgeous masses of bloom in evident, orderly beds, but  keeping always charming surprises for unexpected times and in  unsuspected places. You want the flowers that grow without your help in  ways you have not planned; that hold the enchantment of the wilderness.  Some people are born with this love for the wild, some attain it, but in  either case the joy is there, and to find it you must seek it. Your  chosen trail may lead through the primeval forests or into the great  western deserts or plains; or it may reach only left-over bits of the  wild which can be found at no great distance from home. Even a bit of  meadow or woodland, even an uncultivated field on the hilltop, will give  you a taste of the wild; and if you strike the trail in the right spirit  you will find upon arrival that these remnants of the wild world have  much to show and to teach you. There are the sky, the clouds, the  lungfuls of pure air, the growing things which send their roots where  they will and not in a man-ordered way. There is the wild life that  obeys no man's law: the insects, the birds, and small four-footed  animals. On all sides you will find evidences of wild life if you will  look for it. Here you may make camp for a day and enjoy that day as much  as if it were one of many in a several weeks' camping trip.    However, this is not to be a book of glittering generalities but, as far  as it can be made, one of practical helpfulness in outdoor life;  therefore when you are told to strike the trail you must also be told  how to do it.      =When You Strike the Trail=    For any journey, by rail or by boat, one has a general idea of the  direction to be taken, the character of the land or water to be crossed,  and of what one will find at the end. So it should be in striking the  trail. Learn all you can about the path you are to follow. Whether it is  plain or obscure, wet or dry; where it leads; and its length, measured  more by time than by actual miles. A smooth, even trail of five miles  will not consume the time and strength that must be expended upon a  trail of half that length which leads over uneven ground, varied by bogs  and obstructed by rocks and fallen trees, or a trail that is all up-hill  climbing. If you are a novice and accustomed to walking only over smooth  and level ground, you must allow more time for covering the distance  than an experienced person would require and must count upon the  expenditure of more strength, because your feet are not trained to the  wilderness paths with their pitfalls and traps for the unwary, and every  nerve and muscle will be strained to secure a safe foothold amid the  tangled roots, on the slippery, moss-covered logs, over precipitous  rocks that lie in your path. It will take time to pick your way over  boggy places where the water oozes up through the thin, loamy soil as  through a sponge; and experience alone will teach you which hummock of  grass or moss will make a safe stepping-place and will not sink beneath  your weight and soak your feet with hidden water. Do not scorn to learn  all you can about the trail you are to take, although your questions may  call forth superior smiles. It is not that you hesitate to encounter  difficulties, but that you may prepare for them. In unknown regions take  a responsible guide with you, unless the trail is short, easily  followed, and a frequented one. Do not go alone through lonely places;  and, being on the trail, keep it and try no explorations of your own, at  least not until you are quite familiar with the country and the ways of  the wild.

Not a good drawing, perhaps, but a  good illustration.]      =Blazing the Trail=    A woodsman usually blazes his trail by chipping with his axe the trees  he passes, leaving white scars on their trunks, and to follow such a  trail you stand at your first tree until you see the blaze on the next,  then go to that and look for the one farther on; going in this way from  tree to tree you keep the trail though it may, underfoot, be overgrown  and indistinguishable.
