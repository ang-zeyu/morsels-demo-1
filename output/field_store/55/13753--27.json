BIBLIOGRAPHY      INDEX          WOMAN'S LIFE IN COLONIAL DAYS          CHAPTER I    COLONIAL WOMAN AND RELIGION      _I. The Spirit of Woman_    With what a valiant and unyielding spirit our forefathers met the  unspeakable hardships of the first days of American colonization! We of  these softer and more abundant times can never quite comprehend what  distress, what positive suffering those bold souls of the seventeenth  century endured to establish a new people among the nations of the  world. The very voyage from England to America might have daunted the  bravest of spirits. Note but this glimpse from an account by Colonel  Norwood in his _Voyage to Virginia_: \"Women and children made dismal  cries and grievous complaints. The infinite number of rats that all the  voyage had been our plague, we now were glad to make our prey to feed  on; and as they were insnared and taken a well grown rat was sold for  sixteen shillings as a market rate. Nay, before the voyage did end (as I  was credibly informed) a woman great with child offered twenty shillings  for a rat, which the proprietor refusing, the woman died.\"    That was an era of restless, adventurous spirits--men and women filled  with the rich and danger-loving blood of the Elizabethan day. We should  recall that every colony of the original thirteen, except Georgia, was  founded in the seventeenth century when the energy of that great and  versatile period of the Virgin Queen had not yet dissipated itself. The  spirit that moved Ben Jonson and Shakespeare to undertake the new and  untried in literature was the same spirit that moved John Smith and his  cavaliers to invade the Virginia wilderness, and the Pilgrim Fathers to  found a commonwealth for freedom's sake on a stern and rock-bound coast.  It was the day of Milton, Dryden, and Bunyan, the day of the  Protectorate with its fanatical defenders, the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15489"],[0,"Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners (#2)"],[1," a few serious-minded students, however, have been discouraged from  attempting a study of Freud's dream psychology.    The book in which he originally offered to the world his interpretation  of dreams was as circumstantial as a legal record to be pondered over by  scientists at their leisure, not to be assimilated in a few hours by  the average alert reader. In those days, Freud could not leave out any  detail likely to make his extremely novel thesis evidentially acceptable  to those willing to sift data.    Freud himself, however, realized the magnitude of the task which the  reading of his _magnum opus_ imposed upon those who have not been  prepared for it by long psychological and scientific training and he  abstracted from that gigantic work the parts which constitute the  essential of his discoveries.    The publishers of the present book deserve credit for presenting to the  reading public the gist of Freud's psychology in the master's own words,  and in a form which shall neither discourage beginners, nor appear too  elementary to those who are more advanced in psychoanalytic study.    Dream psychology is the key to Freud's works and to all modern  psychology. With a simple, compact manual such as _Dream Psychology_  there shall be no longer any excuse for ignorance of the most  revolutionary psychological system of modern times.

When they were recalled after  awakening they were regarded as either the friendly or hostile  manifestation of some higher powers, demoniacal and Divine. With the  rise of scientific thought the whole of this expressive mythology was  transferred to psychology; to-day there is but a small minority among  educated persons who doubt that the dream is the dreamer's own psychical  act.    But since the downfall of the mythological hypothesis an interpretation  of the dream has been wanting. The conditions of its origin; its  relationship to our psychical life when we are awake; its independence  of disturbances which, during the state of sleep, seem to compel notice;  its many peculiarities repugnant to our waking thought; the incongruence  between its images and the feelings they engender; then the dream's  evanescence, the way in which, on awakening, our thoughts thrust it  aside as something bizarre, and our reminiscences mutilating or  rejecting it--all these and many other problems have for many hundred  years demanded answers which up till now could never have been  satisfactory. Before all there is the question as to the meaning of the  dream, a question which is in itself double-sided. There is, firstly,  the psychical significance of the dream, its position with regard to the  psychical processes, as to a possible biological function; secondly, has  the dream a meaning--can sense be made of each single dream as of other  mental syntheses?    Three tendencies can be observed in the estimation of dreams. Many  philosophers have given currency to one of these tendencies, one which  at the same time preserves something of the dream's former  over-valuation. The foundation of dream life is for them a peculiar  state of psychical activity, which they even celebrate as elevation to  some higher state. Schubert, for instance, claims: \"The dream is the  liberation of the spirit from the pressure of external nature, a  detachment of the soul from the fetters of matter.\" Not all go so far as  this, but many maintain that dreams have their origin in real spiritual  excitations, and are the outward manifestations of spiritual powers  whose free movements have been hampered during the day (\"Dream  Phantasies,\" Scherner, Volkelt). A large number of observers acknowledge  that dream life is capable of extraordinary achievements--at any rate,  in certain fields (\"Memory\").    In striking contradiction with this the majority of medical writers  hardly admit that the dream is a psychical phenomenon at all. According  to them dreams are provoked and initiated exclusively by stimuli  proceeding from the senses or the body, which either reach the sleeper  from without or are accidental disturbances of his internal organs. The  dream has no greater claim to meaning and importance than the sound  called forth by the ten fingers of a person quite unacquainted with  music running his fingers over the keys of an instrument. The dream is  to be regarded, says Binz, \"as a physical process always useless,  frequently morbid.\" All the peculiarities of dream life are explicable  as the incoherent effort, due to some physiological stimulus, of certain  organs, or of the cortical elements of a brain otherwise asleep.    But slightly affected by scientific opinion and untroubled as to the  origin of dreams, the popular view holds firmly to the belief that  dreams really have got a meaning, in some way they do foretell the  future, whilst the meaning can be unravelled in some way or other from  its oft bizarre and enigmatical content. The reading of dreams consists  in replacing the events of the dream, so far as remembered, by other  events. This is done either scene by scene, _according to some rigid  key_, or the dream as a whole is replaced by something else of which it  was a _symbol_. Serious-minded persons laugh at these efforts--\"Dreams  are but sea-foam!\"    One day I discovered to my amazement that the popular view grounded in  superstition, and not the medical one, comes nearer to the truth about  dreams. I arrived at new conclusions about dreams by the use of a new  method of psychological investigation, one which had rendered me good  service in the investigation of phobias, obsessions, illusions, and the  like, and which, under the name \"psycho-analysis,\" had found acceptance  by a whole school of investigators. The manifold analogies of dream life  with the most diverse conditions of psychical disease in the waking  state have been rightly insisted upon by a number of medical observers.  It seemed, therefore, _a priori_, hopeful to apply to the interpretation  of dreams methods of investigation which had been tested in  psychopathological processes. Obsessions and those peculiar sensations  of haunting dread remain as strange to normal consciousness as do  dreams to our waking consciousness; their origin is as unknown to  consciousness as is that of dreams. It was practical ends that impelled  us, in these diseases, to fathom their origin and formation. Experience  had shown us that a cure and a consequent mastery of the obsessing ideas  did result when once those thoughts, the connecting links between the  morbid ideas and the rest of the psychical content, were revealed which  were heretofore veiled from consciousness. The procedure I employed for  the interpretation of dreams thus arose from psychotherapy.    This procedure is readily described, although its practice demands  instruction and experience. Suppose the patient is suffering from  intense morbid dread. He is requested to direct his attention to the  idea in question, without, however, as he has so frequently done,  meditating upon it. Every impression about it, without any exception,  which occurs to him should be imparted to the doctor. The statement  which will be perhaps then made, that he cannot concentrate his  attention upon anything at all, is to be countered by assuring him most  positively that such a blank state of mind is utterly impossible. As a  matter of fact, a great number of impressions will soon occur, with  which others will associate themselves. These will be invariably  accompanied by the expression of the observer's opinion that they have  no meaning or are unimportant. It will be at once noticed that it is  this self-criticism which prevented the patient from imparting the  ideas, which had indeed already excluded them from consciousness. If the  patient can be induced to abandon this self-criticism and to pursue the  trains of thought which are yielded by concentrating the attention, most  significant matter will be obtained, matter which will be presently seen  to be clearly linked to the morbid idea in question. Its connection with  other ideas will be manifest, and later on will permit the replacement  of the morbid idea by a fresh one, which is perfectly adapted to  psychical continuity.    This is not the place to examine thoroughly the hypothesis upon which  this experiment rests, or the deductions which follow from its  invariable success. It must suffice to state that we obtain matter  enough for the resolution of every morbid idea if we especially direct  our attention to the _unbidden_ associations _which disturb our  thoughts_--those which are otherwise put aside by the critic as  worthless refuse. If the procedure is exercised on oneself, the best  plan of helping the experiment is to write down at once all one's first  indistinct fancies.    I will now point out where this method leads when I apply it to the  examination of dreams. Any dream could be made use of in this way. From"]]]
