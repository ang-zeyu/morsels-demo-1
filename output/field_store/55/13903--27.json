You will find the depression where he lay  in a clump of tall dead grass and watched a while for the rabbit;  reckon the number of mice he caught in the meadow; see his sly tracks  about the chicken coop, and in the orchard; and pause a moment at the  spot where he cast a knowing look behind the hickory by the wall,--all  just as he planned it on his way to the brook.    If, on the other hand, you stand by one of his runways while the dogs  are driving him, expecting, of course, to see him come tearing along  in a desperate hurry, frightened out of half his wits by the savage  uproar behind him, you can only rub your eyes in wonder when a fluffy  yellow ball comes drifting through the woods towards you, as if the  breeze were blowing it along. There he is, trotting down the runway in  the same leisurely, self-possessed way, wrapped in his own thoughts  apparently, the same deep wrinkles over his eyes. He played a trick or  two on a brook, down between the ponds, by jumping about on a lot of  stones from which the snow had melted, without wetting his feet (which  he dislikes), and without leaving a track anywhere. While the dogs are  puzzling that out, he has plenty of time to plan more devices on his  way to the big hill, with its brook, and old walls, and rail fences,  and dry places under the pines, and twenty other helps to an active  brain.    First he will run round the hill half a dozen times, crisscrossing his  trail. That of itself will drive the young dogs crazy. Then along the  top rail of a fence, and a long jump into the junipers, which hold no  scent, and another jump to the wall where there is no snow, and then--    \"Oh, plenty of time, no hurry!\" he says to himself, turning to listen  a moment. \"That dog with the big voice must be old Roby. He thinks he  knows all about foxes, just because he broke his leg last year, trying  to walk a sheep-fence where I'd been. I'll give him another chance;  and oh, yes! I'll creep up the other side of the hill, and curl up on  a warm rock on the tiptop, and watch them all break their heads over  the crisscross, and have a good nap or two, and think of more  tricks.\"    So he trots past you, still planning; crosses the wall by a certain  stone that he has used ever since he was a cub fox; seems to float  across an old pasture, stopping only to run about a bit among some cow  tracks, to kill the scent; and so on towards his big hill. Before he  gets there he will have a skilful retreat planned, back to the ponds,  in case old Roby untangles his crisscross, or some young fool-hound  blunders too near the rock whereon he sits, watching the game.    If you meet him now, face to face, you will see no quiet assumption of  superiority; unless perchance he is a young fox, that has not learned  what it means to be met on a runway by a man with a gun when the dogs  are driving. With your first slightest movement there is a flash of  yellow fur, and he has vanished into the thickest bit of underbrush at  hand.--Don't run; you will not see him again here. He knows the old  roads and paths far better than you do, and can reach his big hill by  any one of a dozen routes where you would never dream of looking. But  if you want another glimpse of him, take the shortest cut to the hill.  He may take a nap, or sit and listen a while to the dogs, or run round  a swamp before he gets there. Sit on the wall in plain sight; make a  post of yourself; keep still, and keep your eyes open.    Once, in just such a place, I had a rare chance to watch him. It was  on the summit of a great bare hill. Down in the woods by a swamp, five  or six hounds were waking the winter echoes merrily on a fresh trail.  I was hoping for a sight of Reynard when he appeared from nowhere, on  a rock not fifty yards away. There he lay, his nose between his paws,  listening with quiet interest to the uproar below. Occasionally he  raised his head as some young dog scurried near, yelping maledictions  upon a perfect tangle of fox tracks, none of which went anywhere.  Suddenly he sat up straight, twisted his head sideways, as a dog does  when he sees the most interesting thing of his life, dropped his  tongue out a bit, and looked intently. I looked too, and there, just  below, was old Roby, the best foxhound in a dozen counties, creeping  like a cat along the top rail of a sheep-fence, now putting his nose  down to the wood, now throwing his head back for a great howl of  exultation.--It was all immensely entertaining; and nobody seemed to  be enjoying it more than the fox.    One of the most fascinating bits of animal study is to begin at the  very beginning of fox education, _i.e._, to find a fox den, and go  there some afternoon in early June, and hide at a distance, where you  can watch the entrance through your field-glass. Every afternoon the  young foxes come out to play in the sunshine like so many kittens.  Bright little bundles of yellow fur they seem, full of tricks and  whims, with pointed faces that change only from exclamation to  interrogation points, and back again. For hours at a stretch they roll  about, and chase tails, and pounce upon the quiet old mother with  fierce little barks. One climbs laboriously up the rock behind the  den, and sits on his tail, gravely surveying the great landscape with  a comical little air of importance, as if he owned it all. When called  to come down he is afraid, and makes a great to-do about it. Another  has been crouching for five minutes behind a tuft of grass, watching  like a cat at a rat-hole for some one to come by and be pounced upon.  Another is worrying something on the ground, a cricket perhaps, or a  doodle-bug; and the fourth never ceases to worry the patient old  mother, till she moves away and lies down by herself in the shadow of  a ground cedar.    As the afternoon wears away, and long shadows come creeping up the  hillside, the mother rises suddenly and goes back to the den; the  little ones stop their play, and gather about her. You strain your  ears for the slightest sound, but hear nothing; yet there she is,  plainly talking to them; and they are listening. She turns her head,  and the cubs scamper into the den's mouth. A moment she stands  listening, looking; while just within the dark entrance you get  glimpses of four pointed black noses, and a cluster of bright little  eyes, wide open for a last look. Then she trots away, planning her  hunt, till she disappears down by the brook. When she is gone, eyes  and noses draw back; only a dark silent hole in the bank is left. You  will not see them again--not unless you stay to watch by moonlight  till mother-fox comes back, with a fringe of field-mice hanging from  her lips, or a young turkey thrown across her shoulders.    One shrewd thing frequently noticed in the conduct of an old fox with  young is that she never troubles the poultry of the farms nearest her  den. She will forage for miles in every direction; will harass the  chickens of distant farms till scarcely a handful remains of those  that wander into the woods, or sleep in the open yards; yet she will  pass by and through nearer farms without turning aside to hunt, except  for mice and frogs; and, even when hungry, will note a flock of  chickens within sight of her den, and leave them undisturbed. She  seems to know perfectly that a few missing chickens will lead to a  search; that boys' eyes will speedily find her den, and boys' hands  dig eagerly for a litter of young foxes.    Last summer I found a den, beautifully hidden, within a few hundred  yards of an old farmhouse. The farmer assured me he had never missed a  chicken; he had no idea that there was a fox within miles of his large  flock. Three miles away was another farmer who frequently sat up  nights, and set his boys to watching afternoons, to shoot a fox that,  early and late, had taken nearly thirty young chickens. Driven to  exasperation at last, he borrowed a hound from a hunter; and the dog  ran the trail straight to the den I had discovered.    Curiously enough, the cubs, for whose peaceful bringing up the mother  so cunningly provides, do not imitate her caution. They begin their  hunting by lying in ambush about the nearest farm; the first stray  chicken they see is game. Once they begin to plunder in this way, and  feed full on their own hunting, parental authority is gone; the mother  deserts the den immediately, leading the cubs far away. But some of  them go back, contrary to all advice, and pay the penalty. She knows  now that sooner or later some cub will be caught stealing chickens in  broad daylight, and be chased by dogs. The foolish youngster takes to  earth, instead of trusting to his legs; so the long-concealed den is  discovered and dug open at last.    When an old fox, foraging for her young some night, discovers by her  keen nose that a flock of hens has been straying near the woods, she  goes next day and hides herself there, lying motionless for hours at a  stretch in a clump of dead grass or berry bushes, till the flock comes  near enough for a rush. Then she hurls herself among them, and in the  confusion seizes one by the neck, throws it by a quick twist across  her shoulders, and is gone before the stupid hens find out what it is  all about.    But when a fox finds an old hen or turkey straying about with a brood  of chicks, then the tactics are altogether different. Creeping up like  a cat, the fox watches an opportunity to seize a chick out of sight of  the mother bird. That done, he withdraws, silent as a shadow, his grip  on the chick's neck preventing any outcry. Hiding his game at a  distance, he creeps back to capture another in the same way; and so on  till he has enough, or till he is discovered, or some half-strangled  chick finds breath enough for a squawk. A hen or turkey knows the  danger by instinct, and hurries her brood into the open at the first  suspicion that a fox is watching.    A farmer, whom I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18194"],[0,"The Life of Buddha and Its Lessons (#2)"],[1,"men of science have carried them to  the outermost verge of the physical universe. Behind them lie not only a  thousand brilliant triumphs by which a part of Nature's secrets have  been wrung from her, but also more thousands of failures to fathom her  deep mysteries. They have proved thought material, since it is the  evolution of the gray tissue of the brain, and a recent German  experimentalist, Professor Dr. Jaeger, claims to have proved that man's  soul is \"a volatile odoriferous principle, capable of solution in  glycerine\". Psychogen is the name he gives to it, and his experiments  show that it is present not merely in the body as a whole, but in every  individual cell, in the ovum, and even in the ultimate elements of  protoplasm. I need hardly say to so intelligent an audience as this,  that these highly interesting experiments of Dr. Jaeger are corroborated  by many facts, both physiological and psychological, that have been  always noticed among all nations; facts which are woven into popular  proverbs, legends, folk-lore fables, mythologies and theologies, the  world over. Now, if thought is matter and soul is matter, then Buddha,  in recognising the impermanence of sensual enjoyment or experience of  any kind, and the instability of every material form, the human soul  included, uttered a profound and scientific truth, And since the very  idea of gratification or suffering is inseparable from that of material  being--absolute SPIRIT alone being regarded by common consent as  perfect, changeless and Eternal--therefore, in teaching the doctrine  that conquest of the material self, with all its lusts, desires, loves,  hopes, ambitions and hates, frees one from pain, and leads to Nirvana,  the state of Perfect Rest, he preached the rest of an untinged,  untainted existence in the Spirit. Though the soul be composed of the  finest conceivable substance, yet if substance at all--as Dr. Jaeger  seems able to prove, and ages of human intercourse with the weird  phantoms of the shadow world imply--it must in time perish. What remains  is that changeless part of man, which most philosophers call Spirit, and  Nirvana is its necessary condition of existence. The only dispute  between Buddhist authorities is whether this Nirvanic existence is  attended with individual consciousness, or whether the individual is  merged in the whole, as the extinguished flame is lost in the air. But  there are those who say that the flame has not been annihilated by the  blowing out. It has only passed out of the visible world of matter into  the invisible world of Spirit, where it still exists and will ever  exist, as a bright reality. Such thinkers can understand Buddha's  doctrine and, while agreeing with him that soul is not immortal, would  spurn the charge of materialistic nihilism, if brought against either  that sublime teacher or themselves.    The history of Sakya Muni's life is the strongest bulwark of his  religion. As long as the human heart is capable of being touched by  tales of heroic self-sacrifice, accompanied by purity and celestial  benevolence of motive, it will cherish his memory. Why should I go  into the particulars of that noble life? You will remember that he was  the son of the king of Kapilavastu--a mighty sovereign whose  opulence enabled him to give the heir of his house every luxury that a  voluptuous imagination could desire: and that the future Buddha  was not allowed even to know, much less observe, the miseries of  ordinary existence. How beautifully Edwin Arnold has painted for us in  _The Light of Asia_ the luxury and languor of that Indian Court,  \"where love was gaoler and delights its bars\". We are told that:        The king commanded that within those walls        No mention should be made of age or death      Sorrow or pain, or sickness ...        And every dawn the dying rose was plucked,      The dead leaves hid, all evil sights removed:        For said the king, \"If he shall pass his youth      Far from such things as move to wistfulness        And brooding on the empty eggs of thought,      The shadow of this fate, too vast for man,        May fade, belike, and I shall see him grow      To that great stature of fair sovereignty,        When he shall rule all lands--if he _will rule_--      The king of kings and glory of his time.\"    You know how vain were all the precautions taken by the father to  prevent the fulfilment of the prophecy that his beloved son would be  the coming Buddha. Though all suggestions of death were banished  from the royal palace, though the city was bedecked with flowers and  gay flags, and every painful object removed from sight when the young  Prince Siddartha visited it, yet the decrees of destiny were  not to be baffled, the \"voices of the spirits,\" the \"wandering winds\"  and the devas, whispered the truth of human sorrows into his  listening ear, and when the appointed hour arrived, the Suddha  Devas threw the spell of slumber over the household, steeped in  profound lethargy the sentinels (as we are told was done by an angel  to the gaolers of Peter's prison), rolled back the triple gates of  bronze, strewed the sweet moghra-flowers thickly beneath his horse's  feet to muffle every sound, and he was free. Free? Yes--to resign  every earthly comfort, every sensuous enjoyment, the sweets of royal  power, the homage of a Court, the delights of domestic life: gems, the  glitter of gold: rich stuffs, rich food, soft beds: the songs of  trained musicians, and of birds kept prisoners in gay cages, the  murmur of perfumed waters plashing in marble basins, the delicious  shade of trees in gardens where art had contrived to make nature even  lovelier than herself. He leaps from his saddle when at a safe  distance from the palace, flings the jewelled rein to his faithful  groom, Channa, cuts off his flowing locks, gives his rich costume to a  hunter in exchange for his own, plunges into the jungle, and is free:        To tread its paths with patient, stainless feet,        Making its dusty bed, its loneliest wastes      My dwelling, and its meanest things my mates:        Clad in no prouder garb than outcasts wear,      Fed with no meals save what the charitable        Give of their will, sheltered by no more pomp,      Than the dim cave lends or the jungle-bush.        This will I do because the woeful cry      Of life and all flesh living cometh up        Into my ears, and all my soul is full      Of pity for the sickness of this world:        Which I will heal, if healing may be found      By uttermost renouncing and strong strife.    Thus masterfully does Sir Edwin Arnold depict the sentiment which  provoked this Great Renunciator. The testimony of thousands of  millions who, during the last twenty-five centuries, have professed  the Buddhistic religion, proves that the secret of human misery  was at last solved by this divine self-sacrifice, and the true path to  Nirvana opened.    The joy that he brought to the hearts of others, Buddha first  tasted himself. He found that the pleasures of the eye, the ear, the  taste, touch and smell are fleeting and deceptive: he who gives value  to them brings only disappointment and bitter sorrow upon himself. The  social differences between men he found were equally arbitrary and  illusive; caste bred hatred and selfishness; riches strife, envy and  malice. So in founding his Faith he laid the bottom of its  foundation-stones upon all this worldly dirt, and its dome in the  clear serene of the world of Spirit. He who can mount to a clear  conception of Nirvana will find his thought far away above the  common joys and sorrows of petty men. As to one who ascends to the  top of Chimborazo or the Himalayan crags, and sees men on the  earth's surface crawling to and fro like ants, so equally small do  bigots and sectarians appear to him. The mountain climber has under  his feet the very clouds from whose sun-painted shapes the poet has  figured to himself the golden streets and glittering domes of the  materialistic Heaven of a personal God. Below him are all the various  objects out of which the world's pantheons have been manufactured:  around, above--Immensity. And so also, far down the ascending plane of  thought that leads from the earth towards the Infinite, the  philosophic Buddhist describes, at different plateaux, the  heavens and hells, the gods and demons, of the materialistic  creed-builders.    What are the lessons to be derived from the life and teachings of this  heroic prince of Kapilavastu? Lessons of gratitude and benevolence.  Lessons of tolerance for the clashing opinions of men who live, move  and have their being, think and aspire, only in the material world.  The lesson of a common tie of brotherhood among all men. Lessons of  manly self-reliance, of equanimity in breasting whatsoever of good or  ill may happen. Lessons of the meanness of the rewards, the pettiness  of the misfortunes of a shifting world of illusions. Lessons of the  necessity for avoiding every species of evil thought and word, and for  doing, speaking and thinking everything that is good, and for the  bringing of the mind into subjection so that these may be accomplished  without selfish motive or vanity. Lessons of self-purification and  communion, by which the illusiveness of externals and the value of  internals are understood.    Well might St. Hilaire burst into the panegyric that Buddha \"is  the perfect model of all the virtues he preaches ... his life has not  a stain upon it\". Well might the sober critic Max Mueller pronounce his  moral code \"one of the most perfect which the world has ever known\".  No wonder that in contemplating that gentle life Edwin Arnold should  have found his personality \"the highest, gentlest, holiest and most  beneficent ... in the history of thought,\" and been moved to write his  splendid verses.
