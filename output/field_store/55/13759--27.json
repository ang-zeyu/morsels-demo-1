He counsels the student to listen to each tone he  produces, for quality and variety.      CLEARNESS A MUST PRINCIPLE    \"The player, as he sits at the piano, his mind and heart filled with the  beauty of the music his fingers are striving to produce, vainly imagines  he is making the necessary effects. Paderewski will say to him: 'No  doubt you feel the beauty of this composition, but I hear none of the  effects you fancy you are making; you must deliver everything much more  clearly: distinctness of utterance is of prime importance.'' Then he  shows how clearness and distinctness may be acquired. The fingers must  be rendered firm, with no giving in at the nail joint. A technical  exercise which he gives, and which I also use in my teaching, trains the  fingers in up and down movements, while the wrist is held very low and  pressed against the keyboard. At first simple five-finger forms are  used; when the hand has become accustomed to this tonic, some of the  Czerny Op. 740 can be played, with the hand in this position. Great care  should be taken when using this principle, or lameness will result. A  low seat at the piano is a necessity for this practise; sitting low is  an aid to weight playing: we all know how low Paderewski himself sits at  the instrument.    \"You ask what technical material is employed. Czerny, Op. 740; not  necessarily the entire opus; three books are considered sufficient. Also  Clementi's _Gradus_. Of course scales must be carefully studied, with  various accents, rhythms and tonal dynamics; arpeggios also. Many  arpeggio forms of value may be culled from compositions.    \"There are, as we all know, certain fundamental principles that underlie  all correct piano study, though various masters may employ different  ways and means to exemplify these fundamentals. Paderewski studied with  Leschetizky and inculcates the principles taught by that master, with  this difference, that he adapts his instruction to the physique and  mentality of the student; whereas the Vorbereiters of Leschetizky  prepare all pupils along the same lines, making them go through a  similar routine, which may not in every instance be necessary.      FINGERING    \"One point Paderewski is very particular about, and that is fingering.  He often carefully marks the fingering for a whole piece; once this is  decided upon it must be kept to. He believes in employing a fingering  which is most comfortable to the hand, as well as one which, in the long  run, will render the passage most effective. He is most sensitive to the  choice of fingering the player makes, and believes that each finger can  produce a different quality of tone. Once, when I was playing a  Nocturne, he called to me from the other end of the room: 'Why do you  always play that note with the fourth finger? I can _hear_ you do it;  the effect is bad,' He has a keen power of observation; he notices  little details which pass unheeded by most people; nothing escapes him.  This power, directed to music, makes him the most careful and  painstaking of teachers. At the same time, in the matter of fingering,  he endeavors to choose the one which can be most easily accomplished by  the player. The Von Buelow editions, while very erudite, are apt to be  laborious and pedantic; they show the German tendency to  over-elaboration, which, when carried too far becomes a positive fault.      CORRECT MOTION    \"Another principle Paderewski considers very important is that of  appropriate motion. He believes in the elimination of every unnecessary  movement, yet he wishes the whole body free and supple. Motions should  be as carefully studied as other technical points. It is true he often  makes large movements of arm, but they are all thought out and have a  dramatic significance. He may lift the finger off a vehement staccato  note by quick up-arm motion, in a flash of vigorous enthusiasm; but the  next instant his hand is in quiet position for the following phrase.      STUDYING EFFECTS    \"The intent listening I spoke of just now must be of vital assistance to  the player in his search for tonal variety and effect. Tone production  naturally varies according to the space which is to be filled. Greater  effort must be put forth in a large hall, to make the tone carry over  the footlights, to render the touch clear, the accents decisive and  contrasts pronounced. In order to become accustomed to these  conditions, the studio piano can be kept closed, and touch must  necessarily be made stronger to produce the desired power.      INTERPRETATION    \"A great artist's performance of a noble work ought to sound like a  spontaneous improvisation; the greater the artist the more completely  will this result be attained. In order to arrive at this result,  however, the composition must be dissected in minutest detail.  Inspiration comes with the first conception of the interpretation of the  piece. Afterward all details are painstakingly worked out, until the  ideal blossoms into the perfectly executed performance. Paderewski  endeavors uniformly to render a piece in the manner and spirit in which  he has conceived it. He relates that after one of his recitals, a lady  said to him:    \"'Why, Mr. Paderewski, you did not play this piece the same as you did  when I heard you before,'    \"'I assure you I intended to,' was the reply.    \"'Oh, it isn't necessary to play it always the same way; you are not a  machine,' said the lady.    \"This reply aroused his artist-nature.    \"'It is just because I am an artist that I ought at all times to play  in the same way. I have thought out the conception of that piece, and am  in duty bound to express my ideal as nearly as possible each time I  perform it.'    \"Paderewski instructs, as he does everything else, with magnificent  generosity. He takes no account of time. I would come to him for a  stipulated half-hour, but the lesson would continue indefinitely, until  we were both forced to stop from sheer exhaustion. I have studied with  him at various times. One summer especially stands out in my memory,  when I had a lesson almost every day.\"    Speaking of the rarely beautiful character of Paderewski's piano  compositions, Mr. Stojowski said:    \"I feel that the ignorance of this music among piano teachers and  students is a crying shame. What modern piano sonata have we to-day, to  compare with his? I know of none. And the songs--are they not wonderful!  I love the man and his music so much that I am doing what lies in my  power to make these compositions better known. There is need of pioneer  work in this matter, and I am glad to do some of it.\"          II    ERNEST SCHELLING    THE HAND OF A PIANIST      As I sat in the luxurious salon of the apartments near the Park, where  Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Schelling were spending the winter, sounds of  vigorous piano practise floated out to me from a distant chamber. It was  unusual music, and seemed to harmonize with the somewhat Oriental  atmosphere and coloring of the music-room, with its heavily beamed  ceiling of old silver, its paintings and tapestries.    The playing ceased and soon the artist appeared, greeting the visitor  with genial friendliness of manner. He was accompanied by the \"lord of  the manor,\" a beautiful white bull terrier, with coat as white as snow.  This important personage at once curled himself up in the most  comfortable arm-chair, a quiet, profound observer of all that passed. In  the midst of some preliminary chat, the charming hostess entered and  poured tea for us.    The talk soon turned upon the subject in which I was deeply  interested--the technical training of a pianist.    \"Technic is such an individual matter,\" began Mr. Schelling; \"for it  depends on so many personal things: the physique, the mentality, the  amount of nervous energy one has, the hand and wrist. Perhaps the  poorest kind of hand for the piano is the long narrow one, with long  fingers. Far better to have a short, broad one with short fingers. Josef  Hofmann has a wonderful hand for the piano; rather small, yes, but so  thick and muscular. The wrist, too, is a most important factor. Some  pianists have what I call a 'natural wrist,' that is they have a natural  control of it; it is no trouble for them to play octaves, for instance.  Mme. Carreno has that kind of wrist; she never had difficulty with  octaves, they are perfect, Hofmann also has a marvelous wrist. I am  sorry to say I have not that kind of wrist, and therefore have been much  handicapped on that account. For I have had to work tremendously to  develop not only the wrist but the whole technic. You see I was a wonder  child, and played a great deal as a small boy. Then from fifteen to  twenty I did not practise anything like what I ought to have done. That  is the period when the bones grow, muscles develop--everything grows.  Another thing against me is the length of my fingers. When the fingers  are longer than the width of the hand across the knuckle joint, it is  not an advantage but a detriment. The extra length of finger is only so  much dead weight that the hand has to lift. This is another disadvantage  I have had to work against. Yes, as you say, it is a rather remarkable  hand in regard to size and suppleness. But I hardly agree that it is  like Liszt's; more like Chopin's, judging from the casts I have seen of  his hand.    \"As for technical routine, of course I play scales a good deal and in  various ways. When I 'go into training,' I find the best means to attain  velocity is to work with the metronome. One can't jump at once into the  necessary agility, and the metronome is a great help in bringing one up  to the right pitch. You see by the firmness of these muscles at the back  and thumb side of my hand, that I am in good trim now; but one soon  loses this if one lets up on the routine.    \"Then I practise trills of all kinds, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1561"],[0,"Pagan and Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning (#2)"],[1,"the propitiation of  earth-divinities and spirits came second, and only last came the belief  in definite God-figures residing in heaven.    At the base of the whole process by which divinities and demons were  created, and rites for their propitiation and placation established, lay  Fear--fear stimulating the imagination to fantastic activity. Primus in  orbe deos fecit Timor. And fear, as we shall see, only became a mental  stimulus at the time of, or after, the evolution of self-consciousness.  Before that time, in the period of SIMPLE consciousness, when the human  mind resembled that of the animals, fear indeed existed, but its nature  was more that of a mechanical protective instinct. There being no figure  or image of SELF in the animal mind, there were correspondingly no  figures or images of beings who might threaten or destroy that self. So  it was that the imaginative power of fear began with Self-consciousness,  and from that imaginative power was unrolled the whole panorama of the  gods and rites and creeds of Religion down the centuries.    The immense force and domination of Fear in the first self-conscious  stages of the human mind is a thing which can hardly be exaggerated, and  which is even difficult for some of us moderns to realize. But naturally  as soon as Man began to think about himself--a frail phantom and waif in  the midst of tremendous forces of whose nature and mode of operation he  was entirely ignorant--he was BESET with terrors; dangers loomed upon  him on all sides. Even to-day it is noticed by doctors that one of the  chief obstacles to the cure of illness among some black or native races  is sheer superstitious terror; and Thanatomania is the recognized word  for a state of mind (\"obsession of death\") which will often cause a  savage to perish from a mere scratch hardly to be called a wound.  The natural defence against this state of mind was the creation of an  enormous number of taboos--such as we find among all races and on every  conceivable subject--and these taboos constituted practically a  great body of warnings which regulated the lives and thoughts of the  community, and ultimately, after they had been weeded out and to some  degree simplified, hardened down into very stringent Customs and Laws.  Such taboos naturally in the beginning tended to include the avoidance  not only of acts which might reasonably be considered dangerous, like  touching a corpse, but also things much more remote and fanciful in  their relation to danger, like merely looking at a mother-in-law, or  passing a lightning-struck tree; and (what is especially to be noticed)  they tended to include acts which offered any special PLEASURE or  temptation--like sex or marriage or the enjoyment of a meal. Taboos  surrounded these things too, and the psychological connection is easy to  divine: but I shall deal with this general subject later.    It may be guessed that so complex a system of regulations made life  anything but easy to early peoples; but, preposterous and unreasonable  as some of the taboos were, they undoubtedly had the effect of  compelling the growth of self-control. Fear does not seem a very worthy  motive, but in the beginning it curbed the violence of the purely animal  passions, and introduced order and restraint among them. Simultaneously  it became itself, through the gradual increase of knowledge and  observation, transmuted and etherealized into something more like wonder  and awe and (when the gods rose above the horizon) into reverence.  Anyhow we seem to perceive that from the early beginnings (in the  Stone Age) of self-consciousness in Man there has been a gradual  development--from crass superstition, senseless and accidental, to  rudimentary observation, and so to belief in Magic; thence to Animism  and personification of nature-powers in more or less human form,  as earth-divinities or sky-gods or embodiments of the tribe; and to  placation of these powers by rites like Sacrifice and the Eucharist,  which in their turn became the foundation of Morality. Graphic  representations made for the encouragement of fertility--as on the  walls of Bushmen's rock-dwellings or the ceilings of the caverns of  Altamira--became the nurse of pictorial Art; observations of plants  or of the weather or the stars, carried on by tribal medicine-men for  purposes of witchcraft or prophecy, supplied some of the material of  Science; and humanity emerged by faltering and hesitating steps on the  borderland of those finer perceptions and reasonings which are supposed  to be characteristic of Civilization.    The process of the evolution of religious rites and ceremonies has in  its main outlines been the same all over the world, as the reader will  presently see--and this whether in connection with the numerous creeds  of Paganism or the supposedly unique case of Christianity; and now the  continuity and close intermixture of these great streams can no longer  be denied--nor IS it indeed denied by those who have really studied the  subject. It is seen that religious evolution through the ages has been  practically One thing--that there has been in fact a World-religion,  though with various phases and branches.    And so in the present day a new problem arises, namely how to account  for the appearance of this great Phenomenon, with its orderly phases  of evolution, and its own spontaneous (1) growths in all corners of the  globe--this phenomenon which has had such a strange sway over the hearts  of men, which has attracted them with so weird a charm, which has drawn  out their devotion, love and tenderness, which has consoled them in  sorrow and affliction, and yet which has stained their history with such  horrible sacrifices and persecutions and cruelties. What has been the  instigating cause of it?     (1) For the question of spontaneity see chap. x and elsewhere.      The answer which I propose to this question, and which is developed to  some extent in the following chapters, is a psychological one. It is  that the phenomenon proceeds from, and is a necessary accompaniment of,  the growth of human Consciousness itself--its growth, namely, through  the three great stages of its unfoldment. These stages are (1) that of  the simple or animal consciousness, (2) that of SELF-consciousness, and  (3) that of a third stage of consciousness which has not as yet been  effectively named, but whose indications and precursive signs we here  and there perceive in the rites and prophecies and mysteries of the  early religions, and in the poetry and art and literature generally of  the later civilizations. Though I do not expect or wish to catch Nature  and History in the careful net of a phrase, yet I think that in the  sequence from the above-mentioned first stage to the second, and then  again in the sequence from the second to the third, there will be found  a helpful explanation of the rites and aspirations of human religion. It  is this idea, illustrated by details of ceremonial and so forth, which  forms the main thesis of the present book. In this sequence of growth,  Christianity enters as an episode, but no more than an episode. It does  not amount to a disruption or dislocation of evolution. If it did, or  if it stood as an unique or unclassifiable phenomenon (as some of its  votaries contend), this would seem to be a misfortune--as it would  obviously rob us of at any rate one promise of progress in the future.  And the promise of something better than Paganism and better than  Christianity is very precious. It is surely time that it should be  fulfilled.    The tracing, therefore, of the part that human self-consciousness has  played, psychologically, in the evolution of religion, runs like a  thread through the following chapters, and seeks illustration in a  variety of details. The idea has been repeated under different aspects;  sometimes, possibly, it has been repeated too often; but different  aspects in such a case do help, as in a stereoscope, to give solidity to  the thing seen. Though the worship of Sun-gods and divine figures in  the sky came comparatively late in religious evolution, 1 have put this  subject early in the book (chapters ii and iii), partly because (as I  have already explained) it was the phase first studied in modern times,  and therefore is the one most familiar to present-day readers, and  partly because its astronomical data give great definiteness and  \"proveability\" to it, in rebuttal to the common accusation that the  whole study of religious origins is too vague and uncertain to have much  value. Going backwards in Time, the two next chapters (iv and v) deal  with Totem-sacraments and Magic, perhaps the earliest forms of religion.  And these four lead on (in chapters vi to xi) to the consideration of  rites and creeds common to Paganism and Christianity. XII and xiii deal  especially with the evolution of Christianity itself; xiv and xv explain  the inner Meaning of the whole process from the beginning; and xvi and  xvii look to the Future.    The appendix on the doctrines of the Upanishads may, I hope, serve to  give an idea, intimate even though inadequate, of the third Stage--that  which follows on the stage of self-consciousness; and to portray the  mental attitudes which are characteristic of that stage. Here in this  third stage, it would seem, one comes upon the real FACTS of the inner  life--in contradistinction to the fancies and figments of the second  stage; and so one reaches the final point of conjunction between Science  and Religion.          II. SOLAR MYTHS AND CHRISTIAN FESTIVALS    To the ordinary public--notwithstanding the immense amount of work which  has of late been done on this subject--the connection between Paganism  and Christianity still seems rather remote. Indeed the common notion  is that Christianity was really a miraculous interposition into and  dislocation of the old order of the world; and that the pagan gods (as"]]]
