Although this fish is not found in the  Ribble, so far as my observations and inquiries have gone, I  believe that it is found in the Tweed, and perhaps also in other  rivers running into the German Ocean; for a letter addressed to  Mr. Kennedy, who was chairman of the select committee appointed to  investigate this subject, by a Mr. George Houy, states that the  Smolts are sometimes found there ten inches long, which he  attributes to their not being able to get down at the proper  period for want of a flood in the river. But I know that in the  Ribble Smolts will go down to the sea without there being a flood  at all, if that does not come within ten days or a fortnight of  the time at which they usually descend to the sea. I also know  that Brambling are found in the Wharfe, in years where there has  been no deficiency in that respect; yet why they should be common  in that river, when they are never met with in the Ribble, which  has ten times as many Salmon and Smolts in it, I am unable to  comprehend.    It is my opinion that the ova of the Salmon are not hatched before  March or April. Two anglers, who were in April wading in the river  Wharfe, came upon a spawning bed, which they had the curiosity to  examine; they found a number of ova, in which they could see the  young fry already alive, and one of them took these eggs home with  him. By regularly and frequently supplying them with fresh water,  he succeeded in hatching them, and kept some of the young fishes  alive for some time; but they died in consequence of neglect, and  were even then very diminutive. The opinion generally received in  Scotland seems to be, if I may judge from the evidence given  before the House of Commons, that the Smolts go down to the sea in  the spring after they are spawned, and that they return in the  summer and autumn of the same year as Grilse. When they return,  and what size they are on their first visit, I have hitherto been  unable to ascertain; but I think I have succeeded in proving that  they do not go to the sea so soon as is generally believed, nor do  any of the witnesses give their reasons for thinking that they do.  I should very much like to learn what evidence they have to offer  in behalf of this opinion.    I remember seeing an article in the \"Scotsman,\" perhaps about  twelve months ago, in which it was stated that Dr. Knox had made  some important discoveries in the natural history of the Salmon  and Herring, both in their food and propagation, and, if I  recollect aright, it stated that he had ascertained that the eggs  remained several months in the gravel, and that then, in a few  days or weeks after, they (_i.e._ the fish hatched from them) were  so much grown as to go down to the sea; but none of the data which  enabled him to arrive at this conclusion were given, and since  then I have heard nothing about the matter. As it is so long since  I read this article, I may have quoted it incorrectly, but I  believe its substance was what I have stated.    The only conclusive evidence I can find about the hatching of  Salmon fry is that of Mr. George Hogarth (second Parl. Report, p.  92), and his account agrees with my own: he states that he took  Salmon spawn from the spawning beds, and by keeping it freely  supplied with fresh water, he succeeded in hatching some of the  eggs; he gives drawings of the appearance of the fry in three or  four different stages, from the egg to the age of eight days (see  Appendix to second Parl. Report), that the young fry, by keeping  them well supplied with fresh water, were very lively and vigorous  for three weeks, but that they after this time appeared to grow  languid and uneasy, and as they would eat nothing they died when  one inch long. Unfortunately he does not state at what time of the  year they were hatched, but if this were in March or April, which  I see no reason to doubt, it is sufficient to prove that they  would not reach the size that Smolts are when they leave the river  for the sea; for supposing them to be hatched the last week in  March, and that they lived a month, this would bring us to the  time when they are about to migrate, at which time they average  more than six inches long; many of them are eight inches, and at  this period they are fond of feeding upon worms, flies, maggots,  and caddis worms, as is known to every schoolboy living on the  banks of a river frequented by Salmon. It is also my opinion that  neither Salmon nor Trout spawn every year, [2] for Salmon ascend  the river as early as January, in the highest condition, with roe  in them no bigger than mustard seed: these could not have spawned  that season, as the Kelts, particularly the females, do not return  to the sea until March or April, [3] and at that time they are in  very bad condition, and do not appear to have a particle of spawn  in them; and in the evidence of Mr. Mackenzie (see Parl. Rep., p.  21), we have an account of a Grilse Kelt which was caught and  marked in March, 1823, and was again caught as a Salmon on its  return to the river in March, 1824. In this case the fish had  evidently required a residence of twelve months in the sea before  it was in a condition to visit the river a second time, and in the  Wharfe it is the constant practice of the angler to catch Trout  through the winter with very minute roe in them, and in high  condition with the worm and Salmon roe, and also with night lines.  In fact, one of the fishermen has frequently remarked to me that  he occasionally caught dishes of Trout with the fly in January,  and in finer condition, than he has found them in April, which he  accounted for by saying that the spawned fish (Kelts) of that  season had not begun to rise freely at the fly at the former  period, but they had at the latter, so that his pannier contained  as many Kelts as fresh fish. Another reason has just occurred to  me: it is, that in January the spawned fish will still be in the  small brooks in which they are so fond of breeding, and of course  the bulk of the fish remaining in the river at that time would be  fish in good season.    As it is some years since I acquired this information, or at least  a part of it, I felt afraid of giving it incorrectly; and I  therefore addressed a letter to a friend living on the banks of  the Wharfe, requesting him to send me all the information in his  possession on this subject, that derived from his own observations,  as well as that collected from others. He has since the above was  written sent me the following reply:--\"I have seen Robinson (one  of the best anglers and fly makers between Cornwall and Caithness),  and have had some conversation with him on the subject of Salmon,  &c. He is of opinion that the spawn of the Salmon remains five  months in the gravel before hatching; he examined the spawn in  April, and found the young fry alive in the eggs, and Ingham,  another angler, took some home and kept one of the Smolts two or  three months. I have subsequently seen Ingham, and he has given me  the same account. All the fishermen here are of opinion that the  female Smolts remain one year, and the males two years, before they  go down to the sea. The Bramblings are supposed to be Smolts which  remain a year longer than the usual time; they are few in number,  and are generally taken with the May fly. I have no doubt that the  above opinions are correct, for we have now three distinct sizes of  Smolts in the river exclusive of Bramblings, the largest of which  are nearly four ounces in weight, and are all males, as they  contain milt in October and November. The next are the females of  the present year: I have had one since the receipt of your letter,  which weighed half an ounce and measured five inches in length;  this was a real blue Smolt; the third are the males of the same  age, and are much smaller; these are occasionally taken with the  worm, and will rise at the fly all the next summer.\"    \"We were for several years, but I do not know the dates, entirely  without Salmon, and of course without Smolts; and we invariably  found that the Smolts made their appearance the year after the  Salmon, but were very small till the second year, when we had what  we call blue Smolts, which disappeared in May or June; and what  you called Pinks, which remained till the following year; and  Brambling Smolts, which remained another year. The fishermen here  are also of opinion that neither Salmon nor Trout spawn every  year. Robinson says that one day lately (the letter is dated  December 13th) he caught seven Trouts, six of which were in good  season; and he brought me two the other day, one of which  contained roe, and the other was in excellent condition.\" My  friend states, in a subsequent communication, that one of the  fishermen had told him that he had caught the male Smolt (Par)  more abundantly on the Salmon spawning beds than elsewhere, and my  friend adds that the opinion there is, that if a female Salmon  gets up to the spawning beds, and if no male accompanies her, yet  her eggs are fecundated by the male Smolts; and they allege, in  support of this opinion, that a female got up one season and  spawned, and though no male was seen near her her eggs were  prolific. I mention this, although I apprehend it is evidence  which the unbeliever will consider inadmissible, for though no  male was seen, still there may have been one, or admitting that  one did spawn, without being accompanied by a male, yet another,  which contrived to bring her mate along with her, may have spawned  in the same place the same season; yet, notwithstanding its  liability to these objections, I have no doubt myself that if a  female"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1831"],[0,"The Lock and Key Library: Classic Mystery and Detective Stories: Old Time (#2)"],[1,"as they used to be  long ago, has its counterpart in the subsidence of the worn face of  maturity or age, in death, into the old youthful look.  Moreover, I  once saw the apparition of my father, at this hour.  He was alive  and well, and nothing ever came of it, but I saw him in the  daylight, sitting with his back towards me, on a seat that stood  beside my bed.  His head was resting on his hand, and whether he  was slumbering or grieving, I could not discern.  Amazed to see him  there, I sat up, moved my position, leaned out of bed, and watched  him.  As he did not move, I spoke to him more than once.  As he did  not move then, I became alarmed and laid my hand upon his shoulder,  as I thought--and there was no such thing.    For all these reasons, and for others less easily and briefly  statable, I find the early morning to be my most ghostly time.  Any  house would be more or less haunted, to me, in the early morning;  and a haunted house could scarcely address me to greater advantage  than then.    I walked on into the village, with the desertion of this house upon  my mind, and I found the landlord of the little inn, sanding his  door-step.  I bespoke breakfast, and broached the subject of the  house.    \"Is it haunted?\" I asked.    The landlord looked at me, shook his head, and answered, \"I say  nothing.\"    \"Then it IS haunted?\"    \"Well!\" cried the landlord, in an outburst of frankness that had  the appearance of desperation--\"I wouldn't sleep in it.\"    \"Why not?\"    \"If I wanted to have all the bells in a house ring, with nobody to  ring 'em; and all the doors in a house bang, with nobody to bang  'em; and all sorts of feet treading about, with no feet there; why,  then,\" said the landlord, \"I'd sleep in that house.\"    \"Is anything seen there?\"    The landlord looked at me again, and then, with his former  appearance of desperation, called down his stable-yard for \"Ikey!\"    The call produced a high-shouldered young fellow, with a round red  face, a short crop of sandy hair, a very broad humorous mouth, a  turned-up nose, and a great sleeved waistcoat of purple bars, with  mother-of-pearl buttons, that seemed to be growing upon him, and to  be in a fair way--if it were not pruned--of covering his head and  overrunning his boots.    \"This gentleman wants to know,\" said the landlord, \"if anything's  seen at the Poplars.\"    \"'Ooded woman with a howl,\" said Ikey, in a state of great  freshness.    \"Do you mean a cry?\"    \"I mean a bird, sir.\"    \"A hooded woman with an owl.  Dear me!  Did you ever see her?\"    \"I seen the howl.\"    \"Never the woman?\"    \"Not so plain as the howl, but they always keeps together.\"    \"Has anybody ever seen the woman as plainly as the owl?\"    \"Lord bless you, sir!  Lots.\"    \"Who?\"    \"Lord bless you, sir!  Lots.\"    \"The general-dealer opposite, for instance, who is opening his  shop?\"    \"Perkins?  Bless you, Perkins wouldn't go a-nigh the place.  No!\"  observed the young man, with considerable feeling; \"he an't  overwise, an't Perkins, but he an't such a fool as THAT.\"    (Here, the landlord murmured his confidence in Perkins's knowing  better.)    \"Who is--or who was--the hooded woman with the owl?  Do you know?\"    \"Well!\" said Ikey, holding up his cap with one hand while he  scratched his head with the other, \"they say, in general, that she  was murdered, and the howl he 'ooted the while.\"    This very concise summary of the facts was all I could learn,  except that a young man, as hearty and likely a young man as ever I  see, had been took with fits and held down in 'em, after seeing the  hooded woman.  Also, that a personage, dimly described as \"a hold  chap, a sort of one-eyed tramp, answering to the name of Joby,  unless you challenged him as Greenwood, and then he said, 'Why not?  and even if so, mind your own business,'\" had encountered the  hooded woman, a matter of five or six times.  But, I was not  materially assisted by these witnesses: inasmuch as the first was  in California, and the last was, as Ikey said (and he was confirmed  by the landlord), Anywheres.    Now, although I regard with a hushed and solemn fear, the  mysteries, between which and this state of existence is interposed  the barrier of the great trial and change that fall on all the  things that live; and although I have not the audacity to pretend  that I know anything of them; I can no more reconcile the mere  banging of doors, ringing of bells, creaking of boards, and such-  like insignificances, with the majestic beauty and pervading  analogy of all the Divine rules that I am permitted to understand,  than I had been able, a little while before, to yoke the spiritual  intercourse of my fellow- traveller to the chariot of the rising  sun.  Moreover, I had lived in two haunted houses--both abroad.  In  one of these, an old Italian palace, which bore the reputation of  being very badly haunted indeed, and which had recently been twice  abandoned on that account, I lived eight months, most tranquilly  and pleasantly: notwithstanding that the house had a score of  mysterious bedrooms, which were never used, and possessed, in one  large room in which I sat reading, times out of number at all  hours, and next to which I slept, a haunted chamber of the first  pretensions.  I gently hinted these considerations to the landlord.  And as to this particular house having a bad name, I reasoned with  him, Why, how many things had bad names undeservedly, and how easy  it was to give bad names, and did he not think that if he and I  were persistently to whisper in the village that any weird-looking  old drunken tinker of the neighborhood had sold himself to the  Devil, he would come in time to be suspected of that commercial  venture!  All this wise talk was perfectly ineffective with the  landlord, I am bound to confess, and was as dead a failure as ever  I made in my life.    To cut this part of the story short, I was piqued about the haunted  house, and was already half resolved to take it.  So, after  breakfast, I got the keys from Perkins's brother-in-law (a whip and  harness maker, who keeps the Post Office, and is under submission  to a most rigorous wife of the Doubly Seceding Little Emmanuel  persuasion), and went up to the house, attended by my landlord and  by Ikey.    Within, I found it, as I had expected, transcendently dismal.  The  slowly changing shadows waved on it from the heavy trees, were  doleful in the last degree; the house was ill-placed, ill-built,  ill-planned, and ill-fitted.  It was damp, it was not free from dry  rot, there was a flavor of rats in it, and it was the gloomy victim  of that indescribable decay which settles on all the work of man's  hands whenever it's not turned to man's account.  The kitchens and  offices were too large, and too remote from each other.  Above  stairs and below, waste tracts of passage intervened between  patches of fertility represented by rooms; and there was a mouldy  old well with a green growth upon it, hiding like a murderous trap,  near the bottom of the back-stairs, under the double row of bells.  One of these bells was labelled, on a black ground in faded white  letters, MASTER B.  This, they told me, was the bell that rang the  most.    \"Who was Master B.?\" I asked.  \"Is it known what he did while the  owl hooted?\"    \"Rang the bell,\" said Ikey.    I was rather struck by the prompt dexterity with which this young  man pitched his fur cap at the bell, and rang it himself.  It was a  loud, unpleasant bell, and made a very disagreeable sound.  The  other bells were inscribed according to the names of the rooms to  which their wires were conducted: as \"Picture Room,\" \"Double Room,\"  \"Clock Room,\" and the like.  Following Master B.'s bell to its  source I found that young gentleman to have had but indifferent  third-class accommodation in a triangular cabin under the cock-  loft, with a corner fireplace which Master B. must have been  exceedingly small if he were ever able to warm himself at, and a  corner chimney-piece like a pyramidal staircase to the ceiling for  Tom Thumb.  The papering of one side of the room had dropped down  bodily, with fragments of plaster adhering to it, and almost  blocked up the door. It appeared that Master B., in his spiritual  condition, always made a point of pulling the paper down.  Neither  the landlord nor Ikey could suggest why he made such a fool of  himself.    Except that the house had an immensely large rambling loft at top,  I made no other discoveries.  It was moderately well furnished, but  sparely.  Some of the furniture--say, a third--was as old as the  house; the rest was of various periods within the last half-  century. I was referred to a corn-chandler in the market-place of  the county town to treat for the house.  I went that day, and I  took it for six months.    It was just the middle of October when I moved in with my maiden  sister (I venture to call her eight-and-thirty, she is so very  handsome, sensible, and engaging).  We took with us, a deaf stable-  man, my bloodhound Turk, two women servants, and a young person  called an Odd Girl.  I have reason to record of the attendant last  enumerated, who was one of the Saint Lawrence's Union Female  Orphans, that she was a fatal mistake and a disastrous engagement.    The year was dying early, the leaves were falling fast, it was a  raw cold day when we took possession, and the gloom of the house  was most depressing.  The cook (an amiable woman, but of a weak  turn of intellect) burst into tears on beholding the kitchen, and  requested that her silver watch might be delivered over to her  sister (2 Tuppintock's Gardens, Liggs's Walk, Clapham Rise), in the  event of anything happening to her from the damp.  Streaker, the  housemaid, feigned cheerfulness, but was the greater martyr.  The  Odd Girl, who had never been in the country, alone was pleased, and  made arrangements for sowing an acorn in the garden outside the"]]]
