At the time when Thomas Jefferson was president of the United States, there  was born among the Green Mountains of Vermont a boy who was to become the  great prophet of the last days. The hills and valleys of Vermont look  beautiful in the summer, but at the time here spoken of they were no doubt  covered with snow, for it was the 23rd of December, 1805, in the town of  Sharon, Windsor county, that Joseph Smith first saw the light of the world.    Joseph was named after his father, whose name was Joseph. His mother's  maiden name was Lucy Mack. Joseph had five brothers and three sisters whose  names were Alvin, Hyrum, (then Joseph), Samuel, William, Don Carlos,  Sophronia, Catherine and Lucy; so you see that there was a large family for  the father and mother to take care of. Joseph's parents were poor and had  to work hard for a living, so when the boys were old enough they had to  help on the farm; this they willingly, did. For this reason Joseph did not  go to school much, but he learned to read, to write fairly well, and to  work some examples in arithmetic. Though Joseph did not get much of an  education at school, yet he was a great student; and then God became his  teacher, so that before he died, as you will see, he became one of the most  learned men in the world.    When Joseph was ten years old they all moved from Vermont to Palmyra, in  the western part of the state of New York. Four years later they moved  again to the small town of Manchester, in Ontario, now Wayne County, New  York.    While the family was living at Manchester there arose a great religious  excitement all through the country. The different religious sects held many  meetings and tried to get people to join them. Joseph was now in his  fifteenth year and he also became interested, as his parents had always  taught him to believe in God and the Bible. Joseph thought he would like to  join the true church of Christ, but what troubled him was to know which of  all these sects was the true church. He could see that all of them could  not be true, as God surely would not have a great many churches, one  striving against the other; also, no doubt, he had read in the Bible that  there was but \"one Lord, one faith, one baptism,\" etc., which the Lord  accepted. Joseph went first to one meeting, then to another. His mother and  some of his brothers and sisters had joined the Presbyterians, but Joseph  could not make up his mind what to do.    But there is a way by which anyone may find out which is the true church  and therefore which to join, and every boy and girl that reads this book  should remember it. It is this: Ask God. Joseph did not know this until one  day while reading in his Testament he came to the fifth verse in the first  chapter of James, which reads as follows:        \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all      men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"    This was just the thing. God had surely led him to read that verse. Joseph  certainly lacked wisdom, and here was a way to find out what he wanted to  know about the sects. The Lord would tell him. All he had to do was to ask.  How simple it was!    On a beautiful morning in the spring of the year 1820, Joseph decided to  ask the Lord for wisdom. He went out into a grove near his father's house,  and after looking around to make sure that he was alone, he kneeled down on  the grass under the trees and began to pray. No sooner had he begun than  some awful power which he could not see took hold of him and made it nearly  impossible for him to speak. It soon became dark around the boy, and Joseph  thought the unseen power would kill him; but he struggled hard and tried to  pray to God for help.    Just at that moment Joseph saw a great light coming down from above, and  then the evil power left him. The light was brighter than the sun, and as  it came down and touched the tops of the trees, Joseph wondered why it did  not burn them. Then it shone all around him, and in the light, standing in  the air above him, he saw two persons who looked like men, only they were  shining with a glory that can not be described. One of them, pointing to  the other, said to the boy:    \"_Joseph, this is my Beloved Son; hear him_.\"    Joseph then asked which of all the religions was right, and great was his  surprise when he was told that none was right; that they all had gone  astray from the truth; and that he must join none of them. Joseph was told  many other things, among which was that some day the true gospel would be  made known to him. Then they left him alone in the woods.    What a wonderful thing! God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ had  actually come to Joseph. He had seen them and they had spoken to him. That  same Jesus of whom he had read in his Bible had come from heaven and his  Father had come with him to introduce him to the boy praying in the woods!    This was the first vision and the beginning of the gospel in our day; and  by thinking carefully about this vision, we may see that it teaches us many  things. First, that God has a body like unto man's. Second, that the Father  and the Son are two persons, not one, as many in the world believe. Third,  that the many religions which man has made are not accepted by God. Fourth,  that God has not ceased to give revelations to men on the earth.    Topics.--1. Joseph's Boyhood. 2. The Vision. 3. What may be learned from  the vision.    Questions and Review.--1. When and where was Joseph Smith born? 2. To  what places did Joseph move? 3. What led Joseph to ask God for wisdom? 4.  Repeat James I:5. 5. Why can not all the sects in the world be right? 6.  Did the Father and the Son come to Joseph solely because of this prayer?[1]  7. Why did the evil one try to destroy Joseph? 8. What may we learn from  this vision?          CHAPTER III.    THE ANGEL MORONI.      When Joseph told of his vision to some of his friends he was surprised to  find that they did not believe him, but made fun of what he said. The  strangest thing to the boy was that the preachers of religion, instead of  being glad at such glorious news, told him it was from the devil, and that  God did not give any more revelations from heaven. All such things had  ceased with the apostles of old, they said. Another strange thing was that  these preachers began to tell untruths about him, and seemed to hate him  for what he told. Still Joseph would not deny his story. \"I have actually  seen a vision,\" he said again and again. \"I know it, and I know that God  knows it, and I dare not deny it.\"    So three years went by.    On the evening of September 21, 1823, after Joseph had retired to his room,  he prayed earnestly that the Lord would forgive him his sins and show him  if he was yet accepted of him. While he was yet praying a very bright light  came into the room, and immediately a person stood in the air by his  bedside. As this person was an angel--a being who had died and had been  resurrected with an immortal body--it is interesting to know how he looked.    Joseph describes him as a man having on a robe whiter than anything he had  ever seen. His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the  wrists. His feet were also bare a little above the ankles. His head and  neck were also bare. Not only was his robe very white but his whole person  shone with great glory. The room was very light, but not so bright as  close around the angel's person.    The angel called Joseph by name, and said that he was a messenger sent from  God to him, and that his name was Moroni. He told Joseph that God had a  work for him to do, and because of this work, good and evil would be spoken  about his name in all nations. The angel then told him of a record written  on gold plates which were hidden in a hill not far away. This record was a  history of the peoples who had lived on this continent, of whom the Indians  were a part. With the plates was an instrument called the Urim and Thummim,  which God had prepared for the translating of the records. After a time  these things would be given to Joseph, but he must take great care of them  and show them to no one except those to whom the Lord would direct. Then  Moroni showed Joseph, by a vision, the place, where the plates were hidden.    After giving much other instruction, the light in the room began to gather  in towards the person of the angel, leaving the room again in darkness,  except just around the heavenly visitor, who soon disappeared in a shining  path into heaven.    Three times that same night Moroni visited Joseph and told him nearly the  same things over again. About the plates Joseph was further told that he  would be tempted to get them for the purpose of getting rich, as the plates  were of great value; but he must not yield to that spirit as they were  sacred, and he must have no other purpose in view than to do the will of  God and build up his kingdom; otherwise he would not get them. At the close  of the third visit it was morning, and then Joseph knew that he had been  talking with the angel nearly all the night.    That morning Joseph went as usual with his father to work in the field,  but he was so weak that he could do but little. His father, seeing this,  told him to go home.    On the way, as he was climbing over a fence, Joseph fell helpless to the  ground. After that the first thing he knew was that some one was calling  him by name. Looking up he again saw the angel Moroni, who once more told  him all that he had related the night before. He then told Joseph to go  back to the field and tell his father of the vision and the commandments  which he had "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16543"],[0,"Trekkerswee (#2)"],[1,"tussendeur gegôi.  \"Hierdie tert is nie vir die fees,  maar vir Willem se takhaarnôi.\"    Net sluip weer Willem deur die kombuis  langs 'n skemerdonker hoek.  \"Willem, wat loop jy so deur die huis  nes 'n hoenderhen wat lêplek soek?\"    Hy swyg; verdwyn weer ongemerk;  hy's met die saak verleë:  die vrouens wat die wee bewerk  (so dink hy) spot daarmee.      X    Die tyd van trek die kom weldra.  Daar gaan oom Koos se ossewa,  blou-bont geskilder; hoor hoe raas  die wiele op pad na oom Gert se plaas.    Al dadelik van die staanplek af  dril die osse-lywe soos hul draf.  Die vrouens roep: hul skud uit lid,  só ruk en rammel dit.    \"Hôi, Willem, hou nou op met klap!  Wat wil jy?... Laat die osse stap.\"  So roep oom. \"Watter haas is daar?  Die middagson sit nog wie weet waar.\"    Dit help so effentjies, maar dan  praat Willem weer bo die rooibont span,  en die ossedier, so stroef en stil,  voel gou-gou wat sy drywer wil.    So kort-kort teen 'n opdraand blyf  die kettingtou nog taamlik styf,  maar anderkant-af swaai dit somaar slap  as die osse weer raak uit maat en stap.    Hul is te veel, maar oom wil tog  ook bietjie met sy beeste spog.  En dan, dis so armoedig om  met so 'n paartjies daar te kom;    dáár by die plaas, daar by die fees  waar soveel mense saam sal wees.--  Oom Gert se plasie haal  hul as die son nog wakker straal.      XI    Ek hoor van vreemde lente melde  as sangtyd wat genaak,  wanneer die voëls in bome-velde  singend hul nessies maak.    Maar hier's geen sang in hoë twyge  as skat van lentetyd,  maar oral diep en ernstig swyge  van velde kaal en wyd.    Ek hoor van vreemde lente melde  as tyd van blommegeur,  wanneer veldblommetjies die velde  versier met tint en kleur.    Maar hier bloei hul in klein alleenheid,  in aarde dor en vas;  by ons is dit àl golwende eenheid  van velde enkel gras.    Só stil eenvoudig in sy worde,  so sonder klank of praal,  kom hier die lente in ryp-verdorde  geweste neergedaal.    Tog is ons lief sy eerste sprietjies,  die grassies aan ons voet;  tog leer dit ons weer nuwe liedjies  van taaiheid en van moed.      XII    So het eenselfde lentelewe,  eenvoudig, diep en waar,  twee stille wesens sag omswewe--  vir Willem en vir haar.    Daar was geen danse of sangerskore,  geen klank of kleure-gloed;  net liefde stil dié dag gebore  by simple boere-groet--    Nog gaan in droomnag stil sy skrede  na simple boerehuis;  oom Gert se plasie is sy Eden--  sover haar voete ruis.    Die kalwerhok is dan die plekkie  waar hy so graag sou staan  om, loerend deur die klipkraal-hekkie,  haar heeldag ga te slaan.    En nou ... hy kan dit skaars gelowe,  sien hy haar wese weer,  net soos 'n lenteson daarbowe  skaamrooierig en teer.    En nou ... sy gaan met hulle same,  sit op die voorste wa,  terwyl hy roep die osse-name  met sweepslag agterna.    En nou ... hy sien haar liewe kappie,  gestik van enkel sis.  En straks ... doen hy 'n klein vriendskappie  as hul gelaer is.      XIII    Die vuurtjie brand  hoog langs die heuwelrif.  Die duisternis bedek die land,  maar dis 'n duisternis waardeur  die maan se melkies sif.    Die vlamme dans  vrolik in vuurge kring.  Die mense sit 'n krans  en luister swygend na  die keteltjie wat sing.    Dit is die trekkersboer  se late lied wat wek  sy hart en diep hom roer.  Dit is sy vroeë môresang  wanneer hy verder trek.    Geen dans in woel'ge saal,  geen lied van danseres  bied hom 'n blye onthaal  wanneer hy eensaam is--  geen drank uit volle fles.    Sy vlamme dans en spring  al rond die ketel-boom;  sy ketel praat en sing  en skink hom in die drank  wat die ure laat verdroom.    Sy keteltjie is swart  al in sy diens gebrand:  die trooster van sy smart  die bly hom trou wanneer  hy soek 'n vaderland.    Die spoor lê oral in  die ronde hopies as;  en telkens as die dag begin  dan swaai dit by die voorwiel, met  'n voorslag-riempie vas.--    Die vlamme dans  nou rond in vuurge kring.  Die mense sit 'n krans  en luister swygend na  die keteltjie wat sing.    Hul aandag span  nog meer wanneer oom Gert  vertel die storie van  Hendrik en Lettie en  hoe gou hul twee geskeie werd.

En ... harte in pyn en hoop,  wyl ryke minnaars kom maar weer  om haar hart te koop.    \"Die jaartal skuif so traag.  Gerug van sonde tot haar kom.  Totdat hy bewend waag...  hy is weerom.    \"Hul leed blyk dan 'n wolk so rein.  Op huweliksdag  'n soete oorwinningsvrede skyn  in purperprag.    \"Maar--die oorlogswoord roep haastig rond.  'Ag, Hendrik, hoe's ons droom so kort!'--  Liefs kort gedroom, as Britse grond  en slawe word.'    \"Sy swyg. Sy perdjie huppel al  na Laingsnek weg.  Hy sink met wein'ge in Natal  om ver te veg.    \"Dis duisternis en stille nag.  'My vriend, ek sterf by die eerste lig,'--  so spreek hy sag,  'maar Lettie wag haar eerste wig.    \"'Laat sy my verre graf hom wys  en eewge trou laat sweer.'  Hy sterf--die dure prys  van vaderland en eer.--    \"'n Moeder veeg haar trane af.  'n Kinderhand die kransie hou.  Hul staan voor 'n gesonke graf.  Dit was die eerste daad van trou.\"      XV    Die nag is heen, die môre is grys;  'n plaat van tente en waens wys  waar Perdekraal se steenhoop rys                         teen hoë hange.    Daar staan hul aan die grond gepénd  die geweltjies so mooi orent--  die eie maaksels, tent aan tent,                        in suiwer range.    o Trekkersvolk, my hart ontgloei!  Ek sien hoe jul die vreemde boei  verbreek het, om dan uit te bloei                          tot eie nasie.    Nie net 'n eie vaderland,  nie net 'n eie vlag geplant,  maar àlles maak van eie hand--                          geen imitasie!    Hoe lê die tentseil, baan aan baan.  Hoe wakker bly die nokke staan.  Die klappies netjies oopgeslaan--                      mooi eenheid same.    Sy staan daar by die wa se as,  die huis van doek, so lossies-vas,  skoon nes in môredou gewas--                         'n blanke dame.    Twee lang wit kappe in die veld:  'n wa en tent daarnaas gesteld,  tweeheid tot eenheid saamgesmelt                        in sware stonde.    Die wa--'n sterke man is hy;  die tent--'n taaie vrou is sy.  Jul het die nasie uitgelei,                     sy boei's ontbonde.    Lig op haar voet net soos die ree  en trekkend met die trekker mee  bied sy hom tog 'n vaste stee                        in angs-geweste:    as wolkbreuk beuk die witte wand,  die sonstrale op die nokke brand  of nagdier sluip oor donker land,                       'n veil'ge veste.    En as sy wa nie verder dring,  hoor ek by wind haar fladdering  die lied van boerbeskawing sing,                        stemmig-tevrede.    Dan word haar seile trou bewaar:  by feesdag net span sy 'n laer  en straal haar seile dankbaar daar                      van groot verlede.      XVI    Oom Gert en Koos die sluit hul waens  vas aanmekaar aan die buitekant  en in 'n lyn met al die waens  wat reeds in rye staan geskaar  uit die omtrek van die Rand.    Die lang grys wasems van die nag  lê soos 'n slangrug in die dal;  dit is die misdamp van die reën  wat in Desember langs die Rand  oorvloedig val.    Daar in die miswolk dryf die kiem  van perdesiekte, sê hul, rond,  maar mens en bees, waarvoor die Heer  die nuwe land gemaak het, is  gesond.    Reg-bo die vuurtjies van die laer  styg stil omhoog die ligblou walm,  en nou die son weer op wil gaan,  styg uit 'n tent nog hier en daar  'n laaste psalm.    Die osse word al losgemaak  en veld toe aangejaag;  'n Kaffer stap hul agterna  wat aan 'n stok sy velskoene en  'n haarge knapsak draag.    'n Enkele hamerslag weerklink  van die wat laat kom, maar  die meeste burgers is gereed  en staan die landsaak te bespreek  in klompies bymekaar.    Die vrouens maak die brekfis al--  die tweede ketel sing;  hul loop tent in tent uit en koes  gramstorig vir die braaivleis-rook  wat trane in hul oë bring.    Straks gaan hul, of dit kerk is, in  hul Sondagspak geklee  na die vermaarde steenhoop heen;  'n ieder neem sy kerkboek en  sy riempies-stoeltjie mee.    Die predikant laat sing; hy lees  en hou 'n nasionale preek.  Dan vra hy ook nog vir oom Gert  wat oral saamgetrek het, om  die landgenote toe te spreek:      XVII    \"My landgenote, julle weet  hul het in Kaapland, vroeg en laat,  'n valse vryheidsleer verkondig;  jul weet die Kafferbendes het  met roof en moord en skelmery,  die grensbewoners daar versondig.    \"Ons het getrek, eers na Natal,  tot aan die see wat vir ons was  'n tweede en wilder Onbekende;  maar nooit het trekkers moed of lus  gehad om na die wildernis  hul dapper trekkersvoet te wende.    \"Hul het daar deur die duinsand heen  hul waens gedryf, en tot vandag  staan daar die boerenaam geskrywe.  Ons vyande 't ons daar gevind,  ons uit-oorlê of aangeval,  en uit dié Kanan weer verdrywe.    \"Ons laat aan Kaffervolk en Brit  die mooiste deel van Afrika  wat slinger langs die strande.  Ons het gekies, om vrede vir  ons voet te vind, die wildernis  en altyd skraler binnelande.    \"God het ons eers gelouter en  laat wraak neem op Dingaan  se duisternis van Soeloe-horde,  dat ons daar in die nuwe land,  nes uit 'n smeltkroes voortgekom,  'n Gode-dankbaar volk sou worde.    \"En later toe die Engelsman  ons weer gedreig het en gedruk,  het ons die steenhoop dáár vergader.  Hier van Transvaal se hoogaltaar  het ons ons harte opgehef  tot God Almagtig, onse Vader.    \"Jul weet hoe God gered het. Dink  aan Laingsnek, aan Ingogo en  aan Amajuba's hoë kranse.  Wee ons as ons weer God vergeet,  soos Israel by Sinaï,  met wilde afgodsdanse!    \"Dan sal die steenhoop ons verkla.  Ek roep tot my getuie aan  die hemel en die heuwelrande!  Dan sal ons hiér moet kerm en klaag,  en rondom hiérdie heil'ge plek  die tekens sien van al ons skande!\"      XVIII    Die fees het weer verbygegaan--  na alkant sien mens waens, soos  die boere in klompies weer vertrek...  Hoe wakker staan die "]]]
