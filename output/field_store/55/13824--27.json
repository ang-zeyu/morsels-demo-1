[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16927"],[0,"Tacitus: The Histories, Volumes I and II (#2)"],[1,"not describe in detail the tactics and  geography of a campaign, perhaps because he could not do so, certainly  because he did not wish to. He regarded such details as dry bones,  which no amount of literary skill could animate. His interest is in  human character. Plans of campaign throw little light on that: so they  did not interest him, or, if they did, he suppressed his interest  because he knew that his public would otherwise behave as Dr. Johnson  did when Fox talked to him of Catiline's conspiracy. 'He withdrew his  attention and thought about Tom Thumb.'    There is no worse fault in criticism than to blame a work of art for  lacking qualities to which it makes no pretension. Tacitus is not a  'bad military historian'. He is not a 'military' historian at all.  Botticelli is not a botanist, nor is Shakespeare a geographer. It is  this fault which leads critics to call Tacitus 'a stilted pleader at a  decadent bar', and to complain that his narrative of the war with  Civilis is 'made dull and unreal by speeches'--because they have not  found in Tacitus what they had no right to look for. Tacitus inserts  speeches for the same reason that he excludes tactical details. They  add to the human interest of his work. They give scope to his great  dramatic powers, to that passionate sympathy with character which  finds expression in a style as nervous as itself. They enable him to  display motives, to appraise actions, to reveal moral forces. It is  interest in human nature rather than pride of rhetoric which makes him  love a good debate.    The supreme distinction of Tacitus is, of course, his style. That is  lost in a translation. 'Hard' though his Latin is, it is not obscure.  Careful attention can always detect his exact thought. Like Meredith  he is 'hard' because he does so much with words. Neither writer leaves  any doubt about his meaning. It is therefore a translator's first duty  to be lucid, and not until that duty is done may he try by faint  flushes of epigram to reflect something of the brilliance of Tacitus'  Latin. Very faint indeed that reflection must always be: probably no  audience could be found to listen to a translation of Tacitus, yet one  feels that his Latin would challenge and hold the attention of any  audience that was not stone-deaf. But it is because Tacitus is never a  mere stylist that some of us continue in the failure to translate him.  His historical deductions and his revelations of character have their  value for every age. 'This form of history,' says Montaigne, 'is by  much the most useful ... there are in it more precepts than stories:  it is not a book to read, 'tis a book to study and learn: 'tis full of  sententious opinions, right or wrong: 'tis a nursery of ethic and  politic discourses, for the use and ornament of those who have any  place in the government of the world.... His pen seems most proper for  a troubled and sick state, as ours at present is; you would often say  it is us he paints and pinches.' Sir Henry Savile, Warden of Merton  and Provost of Eton, who translated the _Histories_ into racy  Elizabethan English at a time when the state was neither 'troubled'  nor 'sick' is as convinced as Montaigne or the theorists of the French  Revolution that Tacitus had lessons for his age. 'In Galba thou maiest  learne, that a Good Prince gouerned by evill ministers is as dangerous  as if he were evill himselfe. By Otho, that the fortune of a rash man  is _Torrenti similis_, which rises at an instant, and falles in a  moment. By Vitellius, that he that hath no vertue can neuer be happie:  for by his own baseness he will loose all, which either fortune, or  other mens labours have cast upon him. By Vespasian, that in civill  tumults an advised patience, and opportunitie well taken are the onely  weapons of advantage. In them all, and in the state of Rome under them  thou maiest see the calamities that follow civill warres, where lawes  lie asleepe, and all things are iudged by the sword. If thou mislike  their warres be thankfull for thine owne peace; if thou dost abhor  their tyrannies, love and reverence thine owne wise, iust and  excellent Prince.' So whatever guise our age may assume, there are  lessons to be drawn from Tacitus either directly or _per contra_, and  his translators may be acquitted at a time when Latin scholarship is  no longer an essential of political eminence.

BOOK I      PREFACE    [A.D. 69.] I propose to begin my narrative with the second               1  consulship of Servius Galba, in which Titus Vinius was his colleague.  Many historians have dealt with the 820 years of the earlier period  beginning with the foundation of Rome, and the story of the Roman  Republic has been told with no less ability than truth. After the  Battle of Actium, when the interests of peace were served by the  centralization of all authority in the hands of one man, there  followed a dearth of literary ability, and at the same time truth  suffered more and more, partly from ignorance of politics, which were  no longer a citizen's concern, partly from the growing taste for  flattery or from hatred of the ruling house. So between malice on one  side and servility on the other the interests of posterity were  neglected. But historians find that a tone of flattery soon incurs the  stigma of servility and earns for them the contempt of their readers,  whereas people readily open their ears to the criticisms of envy,  since malice makes a show of independence. Of Galba, Otho, and  Vitellius, I have known nothing either to my advantage or my hurt. I  cannot deny that I originally owed my position to Vespasian, or that I  was advanced by Titus and still further promoted by Domitian;[5] but  professing, as I do, unbiassed honesty, I must speak of no man either  with hatred or affection. I have reserved for my old age, if life is  spared to me, the reigns of the sainted Nerva and of the Emperor  Trajan, which afford a richer and withal a safer theme:[6] for it is  the rare fortune of these days that a man may think what he likes and  say what he thinks."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16939"],[0,"Gems of Divine Mysteries (#2)"],[1," within the inner reality of His paradise. But as  they have refused to see with the eyes wherewith God hath endowed them,  and desired things other than that which He in His mercy had desired for  them, they have strayed far from the retreats of nearness, have been  deprived of the living waters of reunion and the wellspring of His grace,  and have lain as dead within the shrouds of their own selves.    7 Through the power of God and His might, I shall now relate certain  passages revealed in the Books of old, and mention some of the signs  heralding the appearance of the Manifestations of God in the sanctified  persons of His chosen Ones, that thou mayest recognize the Dayspring of  this everlasting morn and behold this Fire that blazeth in the Tree which  is neither of the East nor of the West.(4) Perchance thine eyes may be  opened upon attaining the presence of thy Lord and thy heart partake of  the blessings concealed within these hidden treasuries. Render thanks then  unto God, Who hath singled thee out for this grace and Who hath numbered  thee with them that are assured of meeting their Lord.    8 This is the text of that which was revealed aforetime in the first  Gospel, according to Matthew, regarding the signs that must needs herald  the advent of the One Who shall come after Him. He saith: \"And woe unto  them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days...\",(5)  until the mystic Dove, singing in the midmost heart of eternity, and the  celestial Bird, warbling upon the Divine Lote-Tree, saith: \"Immediately  after the oppression of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon  shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the  powers of the heavens shall be shaken: and then shall appear the sign of  the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth  mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven  with power and great glory. And he shall send his angels with a great  sound of a trumpet.\"(6)    9 In the second Gospel, according to Mark, the Dove of holiness speaketh  in such terms: \"For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not  from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time,  neither shall be.\"(7) And it singeth later with the same melodies as  before, without change or alteration. God, verily, is a witness unto the  truth of My words.    10 And in the third Gospel, according to Luke, it is recorded: \"There  shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars, and upon the  earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;  and the powers of heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son  of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things  begin to come to pass, know that the kingdom of God hath drawn nigh.\"(8)    11 And in the fourth Gospel, according to John, it is recorded: \"But when  the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the  Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:  and ye also shall bear witness.\"(9) And elsewhere He saith: \"But the  Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name,  he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,  whatsoever I have said unto you.\" (10) And: \"But now I go my way to him  that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? But because I  have said these things unto you...\"(11) And yet again: \"Nevertheless I  tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go  not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will  send him unto you.\" (12) And: \"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is  come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself;  but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you  things to come.\" (13)    12 Such is the text of the verses revealed in the past. By Him besides  Whom there is none other God, I have chosen to be brief, for were I to  recount all the words that have been sent down unto the Prophets of God  from the realm of His supernal glory and the kingdom of His sovereign  might, all the pages and tablets of the world would not suffice to exhaust  My theme. References similar to those mentioned, nay even more sublime and  exalted, have been made in all the Books and Scriptures of old. Should it  be My wish to recount all that hath been revealed in the past, I would  most certainly be able to do so by virtue of that which God hath bestowed  upon Me of the wonders of His knowledge and power. I have, however,  contented Myself with that which was mentioned, lest thou become wearied  in thy journey or feel inclined to turn back, or lest thou be overtaken by  sadness and sorrow and overcome with despondency, trouble and fatigue.    13 Be fair in thy judgement and reflect upon these exalted utterances.  Inquire, then, of those who lay claim to knowledge without a proof or  testimony from God, and who remain heedless of these days wherein the Orb  of knowledge and wisdom hath dawned above the horizon of Divinity,  rendering unto each his due and assigning unto all their rank and measure,  as to what they can say concerning these allusions. Verily, their meaning  hath bewildered the minds of men, and that which they conceal of the  consummate wisdom and latent knowledge of God even the most sanctified  souls have been powerless to uncover.    14 Should they say: \"These words are indeed from God, and have no  interpretation other than their outward meaning\", then what objection can  they raise against the unbelievers among the people of the Book? For when  the latter saw the aforementioned passages in their Scriptures and heard  the literal interpretations of their divines, they refused to recognize  God in those who are the Manifestations of His unity, the Exponents of His  singleness, and the Embodiments of His sanctity, and failed to believe in  them and submit to their authority. The reason was that they did not see  the sun darken, or the stars of heaven fall to the ground, or the angels  visibly descend upon the earth, and hence they contended with the Prophets  and Messengers of God. Nay, inasmuch as they found them at variance with  their own faith and creed, they hurled against them such accusations of  imposture, folly, waywardness, and misbelief as I am ashamed to recount.  Refer to the Qur'an, that thou mayest find mention of all this and be of  them that understand its meaning. Even to this day do these people await  the appearance of that which they have learned from their doctors and  imbibed from their divines. Thus do they say: \"When shall these signs be  made manifest, that we may believe?\" But if this be the case, how could ye  refute their arguments, invalidate their proofs, and challenge them  concerning their faith and their understanding of their Books and the  sayings of their leaders?    15 And should they reply: \"The Books that are in the hands of this people,  which they call the Gospel and attribute to Jesus, the Son of Mary, have  not been revealed by God and proceed not from the Manifestations of His  Self\", then this would imply a cessation in the abounding grace of Him Who  is the Source of all grace. If so, God's testimony to His servants would  have remained incomplete and His favour proven imperfect. His mercy would  not have shone resplendent, nor would His grace have overshadowed all. For  if at the ascension of Jesus His Book had likewise ascended unto heaven,  then how could God reprove and chastise the people on the Day of  Resurrection, as hath been written by the Imams of the Faith and affirmed  by its illustrious divines?    16 Ponder then in thine heart: Matters being such as thou dost witness,  and as We also witness, where canst thou flee, and with whom shalt thou  take refuge? Unto whom wilt thou turn thy gaze? In what land shalt thou  dwell and upon what seat shalt thou abide? In what path shalt thou tread  and at what hour wilt thou find repose? What shall become of thee in the  end? Where shalt thou secure the cord of thy faith and fasten the tie of  thine obedience? By Him Who revealeth Himself in His oneness and Whose own  Self beareth witness to His unity! Should there be ignited in thy heart  the burning brand of the love of God, thou wouldst seek neither rest nor  composure, neither laughter nor repose, but wouldst hasten to scale the  highest summits in the realms of divine nearness, sanctity, and beauty.  Thou wouldst lament as a soul bereaved and weep as a heart filled with  longing. Nor wouldst thou repair to thy home and abode unless God would  lay bare before thee His Cause.    17 O thou who hast soared to the realm of guidance and ascended to the  kingdom of virtue! Shouldst thou desire to apprehend these celestial  allusions, to witness the mysteries of divine knowledge, and to become  acquainted with His all-encompassing Word, then it behoveth thine eminence  to inquire into these and other questions pertaining to thine origin and  ultimate goal from those whom God hath made to be the Wellspring of His  knowledge, the Heaven of His wisdom, and the Ark of His mysteries. For  were it not for those effulgent Lights that shine above the horizon of His  Essence, the people would know not their left hand from their right, how  much less could they scale the heights of the inner realities or probe the  depths of their subtleties! We beseech God therefore to immerse us in  these surging seas, to grace us with the presence of these life-bearing  breezes, and to cause us to abide in these divine and lofty precincts.  Perchance we may divest ourselves of all that we have taken from each  other and strip ourselves of such borrowed garments as we have stolen from  our fellow men, that He may attire us instead with the robe of His mercy  and the raiment of His guidance, and admit us into the city of knowledge.
