[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17192"],[0,"The Raven (#2)"],[1,"in sheer poetical constituents falls below such pieces as \"The  Haunted Palace,\" \"The City in the Sea,\" \"The Sleeper,\" and \"Israfel.\" The  whole of it would be exchanged, I suspect, by readers of a fastidious cast,  for such passages as these:        \"Around, by lifting winds forgot,      Resignedly beneath the sky      The melancholy waters lie.        No rays from the holy heaven come down      On the long night-time of that town;      But light from out the lurid sea      Streams up the turrets silently--               * * *        Up many and many a marvellous shrine      Whose wreathed friezes intertwine      The viol, the violet, and the vine.               * * *        No swellings tell that winds may be      Upon some far-off happier sea--      No heavings hint that winds have been      On seas less hideously serene.\"    It lacks the aerial melody of the poet whose heart-strings are a lute:        \"And they say (the starry choir        And the other listening things)      That Israfeli's fire      Is owing to that lyre        By which he sits and sings--      The trembling living wire        Of those unusual strings.\"    But _The Raven_, like \"The Bells\" and \"Annabel Lee,\" commends itself to the  many and the few. I have said elsewhere that Poe's rarer productions seemed  to me \"those in which there is the appearance, at least, of  spontaneity,--in which he yields to his feelings, while dying falls and  cadences most musical, most melancholy, come from him unawares.\" This is  still my belief; and yet, upon a fresh study of this poem, it impresses me  more than at any time since my boyhood. Close acquaintance tells in favor  of every true work of art. Induce the man, who neither knows art nor cares  for it, to examine some poem or painting, and how soon its force takes hold  of him! In fact, he will overrate the relative value of the first good work  by which his attention has been fairly caught. _The Raven_, also, has  consistent qualities which even an expert must admire. In no other of its  author's poems is the motive more palpably defined. \"The Haunted Palace\" is  just as definite to the select reader, but Poe scarcely would have taken  that subtle allegory for bald analysis. _The Raven_ is wholly occupied with  the author's typical theme--the irretrievable loss of an idolized and  beautiful woman; but on other grounds, also, the public instinct is correct  in thinking it his representative poem.    A man of genius usually gains a footing with the success of some one  effort, and this is not always his greatest. Recognition is the more  instant for having been postponed. He does not acquire it, like a miser's  fortune, coin after coin, but \"not at all or all in all.\" And thus with  other ambitions: the courtier, soldier, actor,--whatever their parts,--each  counts his triumph from some lucky stroke. Poe's Raven, despite augury, was  for him \"the bird that made the breeze to blow.\" The poet settled in  New-York, in the winter of 1844-'45, finding work upon Willis's paper, \"The  Evening Mirror,\" and eking out his income by contributions elsewhere. For  six years he had been an active writer, and enjoyed a professional  reputation; was held in both respect and misdoubt, and was at no loss for  his share of the ill-paid journalism of that day. He also had done much of  his very best work,--such tales as \"Ligeia\" and \"The Fall of the House of  Usher,\" (the latter containing that mystical counterpart, in verse, of  Elihu Vedder's \"A Lost Mind,\") such analytic feats as \"The Gold Bug\" and  \"The Mystery of Marie Roget.\" He had made proselytes abroad, and gained a  lasting hold upon the French mind. He had learned his own power and  weakness, and was at his prime, and not without a certain reputation. But  he had written nothing that was on the tongue of everybody. To rare and  delicate work some popular touch must be added to capture the general  audience of one's own time.    Through the industry of Poe's successive biographers, the hit made by _The  Raven_ has become an oft-told tale. The poet's young wife, Virginia, was  fading before his eyes, but lingered for another year within death's  shadow. The long, low chamber in the house near the Bloomingdale Road is  as famous as the room where Rouget de l'Isle composed the Marseillaise.  All have heard that the poem, signed \"Quarles,\" appeared in the \"American  Review,\" with a pseudo-editorial comment on its form; that Poe received ten  dollars for it; that Willis, the kindest and least envious of fashionable  arbiters, reprinted it with a eulogy that instantly made it town-talk. All  doubt of its authorship was dispelled when Poe recited it himself at a  literary gathering, and for a time he was the most marked of American  authors. The hit stimulated and encouraged him. Like another and prouder  satirist, he too found \"something of summer\" even \"in the hum of insects.\"  Sorrowfully enough, but three years elapsed,--a period of influence, pride,  anguish, yet always of imaginative or critical labor,--before the final  defeat, before the curtain dropped on a life that for him was in truth a  tragedy, and he yielded to \"the Conqueror Worm.\"    \"The American Review: A Whig Journal\" was a creditable magazine for the  time, double-columned, printed on good paper with clear type, and  illustrated by mezzotint portraits. Amid much matter below the present  standard, it contained some that any editor would be glad to receive. The  initial volume, for 1845, has articles by Horace Greeley, Donald Mitchell,  Walter Whitman, Marsh, Tuckerman, and Whipple. Ralph Hoyt's quaint poem,  \"Old,\" appeared in this volume. And here are three lyrics by Poe: \"The City  in the Sea,\" \"The Valley of Unrest,\" and _The Raven_. Two of these were  built up,--such was his way,--from earlier studies, but the last-named came  out as if freshly composed, and almost as we have it now. The statement  that it was not afterward revised is erroneous. Eleven trifling changes  from the magazine-text appear in _The Raven and Other Poems_, 1845, a book  which the poet shortly felt encouraged to offer the public. These are  mostly changes of punctuation, or of single words, the latter kind made to  heighten the effect of alliteration. In Mr. Lang's pretty edition of Poe's  verse, brought out in the \"Parchment Library,\" he has shown the instinct of  a scholar, and has done wisely, in going back to the text in the volume  just mentioned, as given in the London issue of 1846. The \"standard\"  Griswold collection of the poet's works abounds with errors. These have  been repeated by later editors, who also have made errors of their own. But  the text of _The Raven_, owing to the requests made to the author for  manuscript copies, was still farther revised by him; in fact, he printed it  in Richmond, just before his death, with the poetic substitution of  \"seraphim whose foot-falls\" for \"angels whose faint foot-falls,\" in the  fourteenth stanza. Our present text, therefore, while substantially that of  1845, is somewhat modified by the poet's later reading, and is, I think,  the most correct and effective version of this single poem. The most  radical change from the earliest version appeared, however, in the volume  in 1845; the eleventh stanza originally having contained these lines,  faulty in rhyme and otherwise a blemish on the poem:        \"Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful Disaster      Followed fast and followed faster--so, when Hope he would adjure,      Stern Despair returned, instead of the sweet Hope he dared adjure--                                            That sad answer, 'Nevermore!'\"    It would be well if other, and famous, poets could be as sure of making  their changes always improvements. Poe constantly rehandled his scanty show  of verse, and usually bettered it. _The Raven_ was the first of the few  poems which he nearly brought to completion before printing. It may be that  those who care for poetry lost little by his death. Fluent in prose, he  never wrote verse for the sake of making a poem. When a refrain of image  haunted him, the lyric that resulted was the inspiration, as he himself  said, of a passion, not of a purpose. This was at intervals so rare as  almost to justify the Fairfield theory that each was the product of a  nervous crisis.    What, then, gave the poet his clue to _The Raven_? From what misty  foundation did it rise slowly to a music slowly breathed? As usual, more  than one thing went to the building of so notable a poem. Considering the  longer sermons often preached on brief and less suggestive texts, I hope  not to be blamed for this discussion of a single lyric,--especially one  which an artist like Dore has made the subject of prodigal illustration.  Until recently I had supposed that this piece, and a few which its author  composed after its appearance, were exceptional in not having grown from  germs in his boyish verse. But Mr. Fearing Gill has shown me some  unpublished stanzas by Poe, written in his eighteenth year, and entitled,  \"The Demon of the Fire.\" The manuscript appears to be in the poet's early  handwriting, and its genuineness is vouched for by the family in whose  possession it has remained for half a century. Besides the plainest germs  of \"The Bells\" and \"The Haunted Palace\" it contains a few lines somewhat  suggestive of the opening and close of _The Raven_. As to the rhythm of our  poem, a comparison of dates indicates that this was influenced by the  rhythm of \"Lady Geraldine's Courtship.\" Poe was one of the first to honor  Miss Barrett's genius; he inscribed his collected poems to her as \"the  noblest of her sex,\" and was in sympathy with her lyrical method. The  lines from her love-poem,        \"With a murmurous stir uncertain, in the air, the purple curtain      Swelleth in and swelleth out around her motionless pale brows,\"    found an echo in these:        \"And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/172"],[0,"The Haunted Bookshop (#2)"],[1,"e.  It lies in dignifying  it as a profession.  It is small use to jeer at the public for craving  shoddy books, quack books, untrue books.  Physician, cure thyself!  Let  the bookseller learn to know and revere good books, he will teach the  customer.  The hunger for good books is more general and more insistent  than you would dream.  But it is still in a way subconscious.  People  need books, but they don't know they need them.  Generally they are not  aware that the books they need are in existence.\"    \"Why wouldn't advertising be the way to let them know?\" asked the young  man, rather acutely.    \"My dear chap, I understand the value of advertising.  But in my own  case it would be futile.  I am not a dealer in merchandise but a  specialist in adjusting the book to the human need.  Between ourselves,  there is no such thing, abstractly, as a 'good' book.  A book is 'good'  only when it meets some human hunger or refutes some human error.  A  book that is good for me would very likely be punk for you.  My  pleasure is to prescribe books for such patients as drop in here and  are willing to tell me their symptoms.  Some people have let their  reading faculties decay so that all I can do is hold a post mortem on  them.  But most are still open to treatment.  There is no one so  grateful as the man to whom you have given just the book his soul  needed and he never knew it.  No advertisement on earth is as potent as  a grateful customer.    \"I will tell you another reason why I don't advertise,\" he continued.  \"In these days when everyone keeps his trademark before the public, as  you call it, not to advertise is the most original and startling thing  one can do to attract attention.  It was the fact that I do NOT  advertise that drew you here.  And everyone who comes here thinks he  has discovered the place himself.  He goes and tells his friends about  the book asylum run by a crank and a lunatic, and they come here in  turn to see what it is like.\"    \"I should like to come here again myself and browse about,\" said the  advertising agent.  \"I should like to have you prescribe for me.\"    \"The first thing needed is to acquire a sense of pity.  The world has  been printing books for 450 years, and yet gunpowder still has a wider  circulation.  Never mind!  Printer's ink is the greater explosive: it  will win.  Yes, I have a few of the good books here.  There are only  about 30,000 really important books in the world.  I suppose about  5,000 of them were written in the English language, and 5,000 more have  been translated.\"    \"You are open in the evenings?\"    \"Until ten o'clock.  A great many of my best customers are those who  are at work all day and can only visit bookshops at night.  The real  book-lovers, you know, are generally among the humbler classes.  A man  who is impassioned with books has little time or patience to grow rich  by concocting schemes for cozening his fellows.\"    The little bookseller's bald pate shone in the light of the bulb  hanging over the wrapping table.  His eyes were bright and earnest, his  short red beard bristled like wire.  He wore a ragged brown Norfolk  jacket from which two buttons were missing.    A bit of a fanatic himself, thought the customer, but a very  entertaining one.  \"Well, sir,\" he said, \"I am ever so grateful to you.  I'll come again.  Good-night.\"  And he started down the aisle for the  door.    As he neared the front of the shop, Mr. Mifflin switched on a cluster  of lights that hung high up, and the young man found himself beside a  large bulletin board covered with clippings, announcements, circulars,  and little notices written on cards in a small neat script.  The  following caught his eye:      RX    If your mind needs phosphorus, try \"Trivia,\" by Logan Pearsall Smith.    If your mind needs a whiff of strong air, blue and cleansing, from  hilltops and primrose valleys, try \"The Story of My Heart,\" by Richard  Jefferies.    If your mind needs a tonic of iron and wine, and a thorough  rough-and-tumbling, try Samuel Butler's \"Notebooks\" or \"The Man Who Was  Thursday,\" by Chesterton.    If you need \"all manner of Irish,\" and a relapse into irresponsible  freakishness, try \"The Demi-Gods,\" by James Stephens.  It is a better  book than one deserves or expects.    It's a good thing to turn your mind upside down now and then, like an  hour-glass, to let the particles run the other way.    One who loves the English tongue can have a lot of fun with a Latin  dictionary.                                               ROGER MIFFLIN.      Human beings pay very little attention to what is told them unless they  know something about it already.  The young man had heard of none of  these books prescribed by the practitioner of bibliotherapy.  He was  about to open the door when Mifflin appeared at his side.    \"Look here,\" he said, with a quaint touch of embarrassment.  \"I was  very much interested by our talk.  I'm all alone this evening--my wife  is away on a holiday.  Won't you stay and have supper with me?  I was  just looking up some new recipes when you came in.\"    The other was equally surprised and pleased by this unusual invitation.    \"Why--that's very good of you,\" he said.  \"Are you sure I won't be  intruding?\"    \"Not at all!\" cried the bookseller.  \"I detest eating alone: I was  hoping someone would drop in.  I always try to have a guest for supper  when my wife is away.  I have to stay at home, you see, to keep an eye  on the shop.  We have no servant, and I do the cooking myself.  It's  great fun.  Now you light your pipe and make yourself comfortable for a  few minutes while I get things ready.  Suppose you come back to my den.\"    On a table of books at the front of the shop Mifflin laid a large card  lettered:           PROPRIETOR AT SUPPER       IF YOU WANT ANYTHING       RING THIS BELL      Beside the card he placed a large old-fashioned dinner bell, and then  led the way to the rear of the shop.    Behind the little office in which this unusual merchant had been  studying his cook-book a narrow stairway rose on each side, running up  to the gallery.  Behind these stairs a short flight of steps led to the  domestic recesses.  The visitor found himself ushered into a small room  on the left, where a grate of coals glowed under a dingy mantelpiece of  yellowish marble.  On the mantel stood a row of blackened corn-cob  pipes and a canister of tobacco.  Above was a startling canvas in  emphatic oils, representing a large blue wagon drawn by a stout white  animal--evidently a horse.  A background of lush scenery enhanced the  forceful technique of the limner.  The walls were stuffed with books.  Two shabby, comfortable chairs were drawn up to the iron fender, and a  mustard-coloured terrier was lying so close to the glow that a smell of  singed hair was sensible.    \"There,\" said the host; \"this is my cabinet, my chapel of ease.  Take  off your coat and sit down.\"    \"Really,\" began Gilbert, \"I'm afraid this is----\"    \"Nonsense!  Now you sit down and commend your soul to Providence and  the kitchen stove.  I'll bustle round and get supper.\" Gilbert pulled  out his pipe, and with a sense of elation prepared to enjoy an unusual  evening.  He was a young man of agreeable parts, amiable and sensitive.  He knew his disadvantages in literary conversation, for he had gone to  an excellent college where glee clubs and theatricals had left him  little time for reading.  But still he was a lover of good books,  though he knew them chiefly by hearsay.  He was twenty-five years old,  employed as a copywriter by the Grey-Matter Advertising Agency.    The little room in which he found himself was plainly the bookseller's  sanctum, and contained his own private library.  Gilbert browsed along  the shelves curiously.  The volumes were mostly shabby and bruised;  they had evidently been picked up one by one in the humble mangers of  the second-hand vendor.  They all showed marks of use and meditation.    Mr. Gilbert had the earnest mania for self-improvement which has  blighted the lives of so many young men--a passion which, however, is  commendable in those who feel themselves handicapped by a college  career and a jewelled fraternity emblem.  It suddenly struck him that  it would be valuable to make a list of some of the titles in Mifflin's  collection, as a suggestion for his own reading.  He took out a  memorandum book and began jotting down the books that intrigued him:             The Works of Francis Thompson (3 vols.)       Social History of Smoking:  Apperson       The Path to Rome:  Hilaire Belloc       The Book of Tea:  Kakuzo       Happy Thoughts:  F. C. Burnand       Dr. Johnson's Prayers and Meditations       Margaret Ogilvy:  J. M. Barrie       Confessions of a Thug:  Taylor       General Catalogue of the Oxford University Press       The Morning's War:  C. E. Montague       The Spirit of Man:  edited by Robert Bridges       The Romany Rye:  Borrow       Poems:  Emily Dickinson       Poems:  George Herbert       The House of Cobwebs:  George Gissing      So far had he got, and was beginning to say to himself that in the  interests of Advertising (who is a jealous mistress) he had best call a  halt, when his host entered the room, his small face eager, his eyes  blue points of light.    \"Come, Mr. Aubrey Gilbert!\" he cried.  \"The meal is set.  You want to  wash your hands?  Make haste then, this way: the eggs are hot and  waiting.\"    The dining-room into which the guest was conducted betrayed a feminine  touch not visible in the smoke-dimmed quarters of shop and cabinet.  At  the windows were curtains of laughing chintz and pots of pink geranium.  The table, under a drop-light in a flame-coloured silk screen, was  brightly set with silver and blue china.  In a cut-glass decanter  sparkled a ruddy brown wine.  The edged tool of Advertising felt his  spirits undergo an unmistakable upward pressure.    \"Sit down, sir,\" said Mifflin, lifting the"]]]
