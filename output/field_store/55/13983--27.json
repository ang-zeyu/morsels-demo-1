It is certain that the whole contingent world is subjected to a law and  rule which it can never disobey; even man is forced to submit to death, to  sleep and to other conditions--that is to say, man in certain particulars  is governed, and necessarily this state of being governed implies the  existence of a governor. Because a characteristic of contingent beings is  dependency, and this dependency is an essential necessity, therefore,  there must be an independent being whose independence is essential.    In the same way it is understood from the man who is sick that there must  be one who is in health; for if there were no health, his sickness could  not be proved.    Therefore, it becomes evident that there is an Eternal Almighty One, Who  is the possessor of all perfections, because unless He possessed all  perfections He would be like His creation.    Throughout the world of existence it is the same; the smallest created  thing proves that there is a creator. For instance, this piece of bread  proves that it has a maker.    Praise be to God! the least change produced in the form of the smallest  thing proves the existence of a creator: then can this great universe,  which is endless, be self-created and come into existence from the action  of matter and the elements? How self-evidently wrong is such a  supposition!    These obvious arguments are adduced for weak souls; but if the inner  perception be open, a hundred thousand clear proofs become visible. Thus,  when man feels the indwelling spirit, he is in no need of arguments for  its existence; but for those who are deprived of the bounty of the spirit,  it is necessary to establish external arguments.          3: THE NEED OF AN EDUCATOR      When we consider existence, we see that the mineral, vegetable, animal and  human worlds are all in need of an educator.    If the earth is not cultivated, it becomes a jungle where useless weeds  grow; but if a cultivator comes and tills the ground, it produces crops  which nourish living creatures. It is evident, therefore, that the soil  needs the cultivation of the farmer. Consider the trees: if they remain  without a cultivator, they will be fruitless, and without fruit they are  useless; but if they receive the care of a gardener, these same barren  trees become fruitful, and through cultivation, fertilization and  engrafting the trees which had bitter fruits yield sweet fruits. These are  rational proofs; in this age the peoples of the world need the arguments  of reason.    The same is true with respect to animals: notice that when the animal is  trained it becomes domestic, and also that man, if he is left without  education, becomes bestial, and, moreover, if left under the rule of  nature, becomes lower than an animal, whereas if he is educated he becomes  an angel. For the greater number of animals do not devour their own kind,  but men, in the Sudan, in the central regions of Africa, kill and eat each  other.    Now reflect that it is education that brings the East and the West under  the authority of man; it is education that produces wonderful industries;  it is education that spreads great sciences and arts; it is education that  makes manifest new discoveries and institutions. If there were no  educator, there would be no such things as comforts, civilization or  humanity. If a man be left alone in a wilderness where he sees none of his  own kind, he will undoubtedly become a mere brute; it is then clear that  an educator is needed.    But education is of three kinds: material, human and spiritual. Material  education is concerned with the progress and development of the body,  through gaining its sustenance, its material comfort and ease. This  education is common to animals and man.    Human education signifies civilization and progress--that is to say,  government, administration, charitable works, trades, arts and  handicrafts, sciences, great inventions and discoveries and elaborate  institutions, which are the activities essential to man as distinguished  from the animal.    Divine education is that of the Kingdom of God: it consists in acquiring  divine perfections, and this is true education; for in this state man  becomes the focus of divine blessings, the manifestation of the words,  \"Let Us make man in Our image, and after Our likeness.\"(2) This is the  goal of the world of humanity.    Now we need an educator who will be at the same time a material, human and  spiritual educator, and whose authority will be effective in all  conditions. So if anyone should say, \"I possess perfect comprehension and  intelligence, and I have no need of such an educator,\" he would be denying  that which is clear and evident, as though a child should say, \"I have no  need of education; I will act according to my reason and intelligence, and  so I shall attain the perfections of existence\"; or as though the blind  should say, \"I am in no need of sight, because many other blind people  exist without difficulty.\"    Then it is plain and evident that man needs an educator, and this educator  must be unquestionably and indubitably perfect in all respects and  distinguished above all men. Otherwise, if he should be like the rest of  humanity, he could not be their educator, more particularly because he  must be at the same time their material and human as well as their  spiritual educator--that is to say, he must teach men to organize and carry  out physical matters, and to form a social order in order to establish  cooperation and mutual aid in living so that material affairs may be  organized and regulated for any circumstances that may occur. In the same  way he must establish human education--that is to say, he must educate  intelligence and thought in such a way that they may attain complete  development, so that knowledge and science may increase, and the reality  of things, the mysteries of beings and the properties of existence may be  discovered; that, day by day, instructions, inventions and institutions  may be improved; and from things perceptible to the senses conclusions as  to intellectual things may be deduced.    He must also impart spiritual education, so that intelligence and  comprehension may penetrate the metaphysical world, and may receive  benefit from the sanctifying breeze of the Holy Spirit, and may enter into  relationship with the Supreme Concourse. He must so educate the human  reality that it may become the center of the divine appearance, to such a  degree that the attributes and the names of God shall be resplendent in  the mirror of the reality of man, and the holy verse \"We will make man in  Our image and likeness\" shall be realized.(3)    It is clear that human power is not able to fill such a great office, and  that reason alone could not undertake the responsibility of so great a  mission. How can one solitary person without help and without support lay  the foundations of such a noble construction? He must depend on the help  of the spiritual and divine power to be able to undertake this mission.  One Holy Soul gives life to the world of humanity, changes the aspect of  the terrestrial globe, causes intelligence to progress, vivifies souls,  lays the basis of a new life, establishes new foundations, organizes the  world, brings nations and religions under the shadow of one standard,  delivers man from the world of imperfections and vices, and inspires him  with the desire and need of natural and acquired perfections. Certainly  nothing short of a divine power could accomplish so great a work. We ought  to consider this with justice, for this is the office of justice.    A Cause which all the governments and peoples of the world, with all their  powers and armies, cannot promulgate and spread, one Holy Soul can promote  without help or support! Can this be done by human power? No, in the name  of God! For example, Christ, alone and solitary, upraised the standard of  peace and righteousness, a work which all the victorious governments with  all their hosts are unable to accomplish. Consider what was the fate of so  many and diverse empires and peoples: the Roman Empire, France, Germany,  Russia, England, etc.; all were gathered together under the same tent--that  is to say, the appearance of Christ brought about a union among these  diverse nations, some of whom, under the influence of Christianity, became  so united that they sacrificed their lives and property for one another.  After the time of Constantine, who was the protagonist of Christianity,  divisions broke out among them. The point is this, that Christ united  these nations but after a while governments became the cause of discord.  What I mean is that Christ sustained a Cause that all the kings of the  earth could not establish! He united the various religions and modified  ancient customs. Consider what great differences existed between Romans,  Greeks, Syrians, Egyptians, Phoenicians, Israelites and other peoples of  Europe. Christ removed these differences and became the cause of love  between these communities. Although after some time governments destroyed  this union, the work of Christ was accomplished.    Therefore, the Universal Educator must be at the same time a physical,  human and spiritual educator; and He must possess a supernatural power, so  that He may hold the position of a divine teacher. If He does not show  forth such a holy power, He will not be able to educate, for if He be  imperfect, how can He give a perfect education? If He be ignorant, how can  He make others wise? If He be unjust, how can He make others just? If He  be earthly, how can He make others heavenly?    Now we must consider justly: did these Divine Manifestations Who have  appeared possess all these qualifications or not?(4) If They had not these  qualifications and these perfections, They were not real Educators.    Therefore, it must be our task to prove to the thoughtful by reasonable  arguments the prophethood"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1929"],[0,"The School for Scandal (#2)"],[1,"   Mr. Parsons       SIR BENJAMIN BACKBITE Mr. Dodd       ROWLEY                Mr. Aikin       SPUNGE       MOSES       SNAKE       CARELESS--and other companions to CHARLES         LADY TEAZLE       MARIA       LADY SNEERWELL       MRS.

No need of lessons now, the knowing think;       We might as well be taught to eat and drink.       Caused by a dearth of scandal, should the vapours       Distress our fair ones--let them read the papers;       Their powerful mixtures such disorders hit;       Crave what you will--there's quantum sufficit.       \"Lord!\" cries my Lady Wormwood (who loves tattle,       And puts much salt and pepper in her prattle),       Just risen at noon, all night at cards when threshing       Strong tea and scandal--\"Bless me, how refreshing!

ACT I      SCENE I.--LADY SNEERWELL'S House    LADY SNEERWELL at her dressing table with LAPPET; MISS VERJUICE drinking  chocolate    LADY SNEERWELL. The Paragraphs you say were all inserted:    VERJUICE. They were Madam--and as I copied them myself in a feigned Hand  there can be no suspicion whence they came.    LADY SNEERWELL. Did you circulate the Report of Lady Brittle's Intrigue  with Captain Boastall?    VERJUICE. Madam by this Time Lady Brittle is the Talk of half the  Town--and I doubt not in a week the Men will toast her as a Demirep.    LADY SNEERWELL. What have you done as to the insinuation as to a certain  Baronet's Lady and a certain Cook.    VERJUICE. That is in as fine a Train as your Ladyship could wish. I told  the story yesterday to my own maid with directions to communicate it  directly to my Hairdresser. He I am informed has a Brother who courts a  Milliners' Prentice in Pallmall whose mistress has a first cousin whose  sister is Feme [Femme] de Chambre to Mrs. Clackit--so that in the  common course of Things it must reach Mrs. Clackit's Ears within  four-and-twenty hours and then you know the Business is as good as done.    LADY SNEERWELL. Why truly Mrs. Clackit has a very pretty Talent--a great  deal of industry--yet--yes--been tolerably successful in her way--To my  knowledge she has been the cause of breaking off six matches[,] of three  sons being disinherited and four Daughters being turned out of Doors.  Of three several Elopements, as many close confinements--nine separate  maintenances and two Divorces.--nay I have more than once traced her  causing a Tete-a-Tete in the Town and Country Magazine--when the Parties  perhaps had never seen each other's Faces before in the course of their  Lives.    VERJUICE. She certainly has Talents.    LADY SNEERWELL. But her manner is gross.    VERJUICE. 'Tis very true. She generally designs well[,] has a free  tongue and a bold invention--but her colouring is too dark and her  outline often extravagant--She wants that delicacy of Tint--and  mellowness of sneer--which distinguish your Ladyship's Scandal.    LADY SNEERWELL. Ah you are Partial Verjuice.    VERJUICE. Not in the least--everybody allows that Lady Sneerwell can do  more with a word or a Look than many can with the most laboured Detail  even when they happen to have a little truth on their side to support  it.    LADY SNEERWELL. Yes my dear Verjuice. I am no Hypocrite to deny the  satisfaction I reap from the Success of my Efforts. Wounded myself, in  the early part of my Life by the envenomed Tongue of Slander I confess  I have since known no Pleasure equal to the reducing others to the Level  of my own injured Reputation.    VERJUICE. Nothing can be more natural--But my dear Lady Sneerwell There  is one affair in which you have lately employed me, wherein, I confess I  am at a Loss to guess your motives.    LADY SNEERWELL. I conceive you mean with respect to my neighbour, Sir  Peter Teazle, and his Family--Lappet.--And has my conduct in this matter  really appeared to you so mysterious?         [Exit MAID.]    VERJUICE. Entirely so.    LADY SNEERWELL. [VERJUICE.?] An old Batchelor as Sir Peter was[,] having  taken a young wife from out of the Country--as Lady Teazle is--are  certainly fair subjects for a little mischievous raillery--but here are  two young men--to whom Sir Peter has acted as a kind of Guardian since  their Father's death, the eldest possessing the most amiable Character  and universally well spoken of[,] the youngest the most dissipated  and extravagant young Fellow in the Kingdom, without Friends or  caracter--the former one an avowed admirer of yours and apparently  your Favourite[,] the latter attached to Maria Sir Peter's ward--and  confessedly beloved by her. Now on the face of these circumstances it  is utterly unaccountable to me why you a young Widow with no great  jointure--should not close with the passion of a man of such character  and expectations as Mr. Surface--and more so why you should be so  uncommonly earnest to destroy the mutual Attachment subsisting between  his Brother Charles and Maria.    LADY SNEERWELL. Then at once to unravel this mistery--I must inform you  that Love has no share whatever in the intercourse between Mr. Surface  and me.    VERJUICE. No!    LADY SNEERWELL. His real attachment is to Maria or her Fortune--but  finding in his Brother a favoured Rival, He has been obliged to mask his  Pretensions--and profit by my Assistance.    VERJUICE. Yet still I am more puzzled why you should interest yourself  in his success.    LADY SNEERWELL. Heavens! how dull you are! cannot you surmise the  weakness which I hitherto, thro' shame have concealed even from  you--must I confess that Charles--that Libertine, that extravagant, that  Bankrupt in Fortune and Reputation--that He it is for whom I am thus  anxious and malicious and to gain whom I would sacrifice--everything----    VERJUICE. Now indeed--your conduct appears consistent and I no longer  wonder at your enmity to Maria, but how came you and Surface so  confidential?    LADY SNEERWELL. For our mutual interest--but I have found out him a long  time since[,] altho' He has contrived to deceive everybody beside--I  know him to be artful selfish and malicious--while with Sir Peter, and  indeed with all his acquaintance, He passes for a youthful Miracle of  Prudence--good sense and Benevolence.    VERJUICE. Yes yes--I know Sir Peter vows He has not his equal in  England; and, above all, He praises him as a MAN OF SENTIMENT.    LADY SNEERWELL. True and with the assistance of his sentiments and  hypocrisy he has brought Sir Peter entirely in his interests with  respect to Maria and is now I believe attempting to flatter Lady Teazle  into the same good opinion towards him--while poor Charles has no Friend  in the House--though I fear he has a powerful one in Maria's Heart,  against whom we must direct our schemes.    SERVANT. Mr. Surface.    LADY SNEERWELL. Shew him up. He generally calls about this Time. I don't  wonder at People's giving him to me for a Lover.         Enter SURFACE    SURFACE. My dear Lady Sneerwell, how do you do to-day--your most  obedient.    LADY SNEERWELL. Miss Verjuice has just been arraigning me on our mutual  attachment now; but I have informed her of our real views and the  Purposes for which our Geniuses at present co-operate. You know  how useful she has been to us--and believe me the confidence is not  ill-placed.    SURFACE. Madam, it is impossible for me to suspect that a Lady of Miss  Verjuice's sensibility and discernment----    LADY SNEERWELL. Well--well--no compliments now--but tell me when you saw  your mistress or what is more material to me your Brother.    SURFACE. I have not seen either since I saw you--but I can inform you  that they are at present at Variance--some of your stories have taken  good effect on Maria.    LADY SNEERWELL. Ah! my dear Verjuice the merit of this belongs to you.  But do your Brother's Distresses encrease?    SURFACE. Every hour. I am told He had another execution in his house  yesterday--in short his Dissipation and extravagance exceed anything I  have ever heard of.    LADY SNEERWELL. Poor Charles!    SURFACE. True Madam--notwithstanding his Vices one can't help feeling  for him--ah poor Charles! I'm sure I wish it was in my Power to be of  any essential Service to him--for the man who does not share in  the Distresses of a Brother--even though merited by his own"]]]
