MILITARY SERVICE AS A MEANS OF DE-JUDAIZATION    The era of Nicholas I. was typically inaugurated by the bloody  suppression of the Decembrists and their constitutional demands, [1]  proving as it subsequently did one continuous triumph of military  despotism over the liberal movements of the age. As for the emancipation  of the Jews, it was entirely unthinkable in an empire which had become  Europe's bulwark against the inroads of revolutionary or even moderately  liberal tendencies. The new despotic regime, overflowing with aggressive  energy, was bound to create, after its likeness, a novel method of  dealing with the Jewish problem. Such a method was contrived by the iron  will of the Russian autocrat.    [Footnote 1: See Vol. I, p. 410, n. 1.]    Nicholas I., who was originally intended for a military career, was  placed on the Russian throne by a whim of fate.[1] Prior to his  accession, Nicholas had shown no interest in the Jewish problem. The  Jewish masses had flitted across his vision but once--in 1816--when,  still a young man, he traveled through Russia for his education. The  impression produced upon him by this strange people is recorded by the  then grand duke in his diary in a manner fully coincident with the  official views of the Government:    [Footnote 1: After the death of Alexander I. the Russian crown fell to  his eldest brother Constantine, military commander of Poland.  Accordingly, Constantine was proclaimed emperor, and was recognized as  such by Nicholas. Constantine, however, who had secretly abdicated some  time previously, insisted on resigning, and Nicholas became Tzar.]      The ruin of the peasants of these provinces [1] are the Zhyds. [2] As    property-holders they are here second in importance to the landed    nobility. By their commercial pursuits they drain the strength of    the hapless White Russian people.... They are everything here:    merchants, contractors, saloon-keepers, mill-owners, ferry-holders,    artisans.... They are regular leeches, and suck these unfortunate    governments [3] to the point of exhaustion. It is a matter of    surprise that in 1812 they displayed exemplary loyalty to us and    assisted us wherever they could at the risk of their lives.    [Footnote 1: Nicholas is speaking of White Russia. Compare Vol. I, pp.  329 and 406.]    [Footnote 2: See on this term Vol. I, p. 320, n. 2.]    [Footnote 3: See on this term Vol. I, p. 308, n. 1.]    The characterization of merchants, artisans, mill-owners, and  ferry-holders as \"leeches\" could only spring from a conception which  looked upon the Jews as transient foreigners, who, by pursuing any line  of endeavor, could only do so at the expense of the natives and thus  abused the hospitality offered to them. No wonder then that the future  Tzar was puzzled by the display of patriotic sentiments on the part of  the Jewish population at the fatal juncture in the history of Russia.    This inimical view of the Jewish people was retained by Nicholas when he  became the master of Russian-Jewish destinies. He regarded the Jews as  an \"injurious element,\" which had no place in a Slavonic Greek-Orthodox  monarchy, and which therefore ought to be combated. The Jews must be  rendered innocuous, must be \"corrected\" and curbed by such energetic  military methods as are in keeping with a form of government based upon  the principles of stern tutelage and discipline. As a result of these  considerations, a singular scheme was gradually maturing in the mind of  the Tzar: to detach the Jews from Judaism by impressing them into a  military service of a wholly exceptional character.    The plan of introducing personal military service, instead of the  hitherto customary exemption tax, [1] had engaged the attention of the  Russian Government towards the end of Alexander I's reign, and had  caused a great deal of alarm among the Jewish communities. Nicholas I.  was now resolved to carry this plan into effect. Not satisfied with  imposing a civil obligation upon a people deprived of civil rights, the  Tzar desired to use the Russian military service, a service marked by  most extraordinary features, as an educational and disciplinary agency  for his Jewish subjects: the barrack was to serve as a school, or rather  as a factory, for producing a new generation of de-Judaized Jews, who  were completely Russified, and, if possible, Christianized.    [Footnote 1: See Vol. I, p. 318.]    The extension of the term of military service, marked by the ferocious  discipline of that age, to a period of twenty-five years, the enrolment  of immature lads or practically boys, their prolonged separation from a  Jewish environment, and finally the employment of such methods as were  likely to produce an immediate effect upon the recruits in the desired  direction--all this was deemed an infallible means of dissolving Russian  Jewry within the dominant nation, nay, within the dominant Church. It  was a direct and simplified scheme which seemed to lead in a straight  line to the goal. But had the ruling spheres of St. Petersburg known the  history of the Jewish people, they might have realized that the  annihilation of Judaism had in past ages been attempted more than once  by other, no less forcible, means and that the attempt had always proved  a failure.    In the very first year of the new reign, the plan of transforming the  Jews by \"military\" methods was firmly settled in the emperor's mind. In  1826 Nichola instructed his ministers to draft a special statute of  military service for the Jews, departing in some respects from the  general law. In view of the fact that the new military reform was  intended to include the Western region [1], which was under the military  command of the Tzar's brother. Grand Duke Constantine [2], the draft was  sent to him to Warsaw for further suggestions and approval, and was in  turn transmitted by the grand duke to Senator Nicholas Novosiltzev, his  co-regent [3], for investigation and report. As an experienced statesman,  who had familiarized himself during his administrative activity with the  Jewish conditions obtaining in the Western region, Novosiltzev realized  the grave risks involved in the imperial scheme. In a memorandum  submitted by him to the grand duke, he argued convincingly that the  sudden imposition of military service upon the Jews was bound to cause  an undesirable agitation among them, and that they should, on the  contrary, be slowly \"prepared for such a radical transformation.\"    [Footnote 1: The official designation for the territories of Western  Russia which were formerly a part of the Polish Empire.]    [Footnote 2: Constantine was appointed by his brother Alexander I,  Commander-in-chief of the Polish army after the restoration of Poland in  1815. He remained"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15767"],[0,"The Texan Scouts: A Story of the Alamo and Goliad (#2)"],[1,"addle, and once more stroked the nose  of his horse.    \"Good Old Jack,\" he murmured--he had called him Old Jack after Andrew  Jackson, then a mighty hero of the south and west, \"you passed through  the ordeal and never moved, like the silent gentleman that you are.\"    Old Jack whinnied ever so softly, and rubbed his nose against the boy's  coat sleeve. Ned mounted him and rode out of the dip, pausing at the top  of the swell for a long look in every direction. The night was now  peaceful and there was no noise, save for the warm wind that blew out of  the south with a gentle sighing sound almost like the note of music.  Trickles of water from the snow, already melting, ran down the crests.  Lighter and lighter grew the sky. The moon seemed to Ned to be poised  directly overhead, and close by. New stars were springing out as the  last clouds floated away.    Ned sought shelter, warmth and a place in which to sleep, and to secure  these three he felt that he must seek timber. The scouts whom he had  seen were probably the only Mexicans north of the Rio Grande, and, as he  believed, there was not one chance in a thousand of meeting such enemies  again. If he should be so lucky as to find shelter he would sleep there  without fear.    He rode almost due north for more than two hours, seeing patches of  chaparral on both right and left. But, grown fastidious now and not  thinking them sufficient for his purpose, he continued his northern  course. Old Jack's feet made a deep sighing sound as they sank in the  snow, and now there was water everywhere as that soft but conquering  south wind blew steadily over the plain.    When he saw a growth of timber rising high and dark upon a swell he  believed that he had found his place, and he urged his horse to renewed  speed. The trees proved to be pecans, aspens and oaks growing so densely  that he was compelled to dismount and lead Old Jack before they could  force an entrance. Inside he found a clear space, somewhat like the  openings of the north, in shape an irregular circle, but not more than  fifteen feet across. Great spreading boughs of oaks had protected it so  well that but little snow had fallen there, and that little had melted.  Already the ground in the circle was drying.    Ned uttered an exclamation of relief and gratitude. This would be his  camp, and to one used to living in the wilderness it furnished good  shelter. At one edge of the opening was an outcropping of flat rock now  quite dry, and there he would spread his bed. He unsaddled and unbridled  his horse, merely tethering him with a lariat, and spread the horse  blanket upon the flat rock. He would lie upon this and cover himself  with his own blankets, using the saddle as a pillow.    But the security of the covert tempted the boy, who was now as hungry as  a bear just come from winter quarters. He felt weak and relaxed after  his long hours in the snow and storm, and he resolved to have warm food  and drink.    There was much fallen wood among the trees, and with his strong hunting  knife he whittled off the bark and thin dry shavings until he had a fine  heap. Working long with flint and steel, he managed to set fire to the  shavings, and then he fed the flames with larger pieces of wood until  he had a great bed of glowing coals. A cautious wilderness rover,  learning always from his tried friends, Ned never rode the plains  without his traveling equipment, and now he drew from his pack a small  tin coffee pot and tiny cup of the same material. Then with quick and  skillful hands he made coffee over the coals and warmed strips of deer  and buffalo meat.    He ate and drank hungrily, while the horse nibbled the grass that grew  within the covert. Glorious warmth came again and the worn feeling  departed. Life, youthful, fresh and abounding, swelled in every vein.    He now put out all the coals carefully, throwing wet leaves upon them,  in order that not a single spark might shine through the trees to be  seen by an enemy upon the plain. He relied upon the horse to give  warning of a possible approach by man, and to keep away wolves.    Then he made his bed upon the rock, doing everything as he had arranged  it in his mind an hour before, and, wrapped in his blankets, fell into  the soundest of sleeps. The south wind still blew steadily, playing a  low musical song among the trees. The beads of water on the twigs and  the few leaves that remained dried fast. The grass dried, too, and  beyond the covert the snow, so quick to come, was equally quick to go.    The horse ceased to nibble the grass, looked at the sleeping boy,  touched his blankets lightly with his nose, and walked to the other side  of the opening, where he lay down and went to his own horse heaven of  sleep.    It was not many hours until day and Old Jack was a light sleeper. When  he opened his eyes again he saw a clear and beautiful winter day of the  far south. The only clouds in the sky were little drifting bits of fine  white wool, and the warm wind still blew. Old Jack, who was in reality  Young Jack, as his years were not yet four, did not think so much of the  covert now, as he had already eaten away all the grass within the little  opening but his sense of duty was strong. He saw that his human master  and comrade still slept, apparently with no intention of awakening at  any very early date, and he set himself to gleaning stray blades of  grass that might have escaped his notice the night before.    Ned awoke a little after the noon hour, and sprang to his feet in  dismay. The sun was almost directly over his head, showing him how late  it was. He looked at his horse as if to reproach his good comrade for  not waking him sooner, but Old Jack's large mild eyes gave him such a  gaze of benignant unconcern that the boy was ashamed of himself.    \"It certainly was not your fault,\" he said to his horse, \"and, after  all, it probably doesn't matter. We've had a long sound sleep and rest,  and I've no doubt that both of us will profit by it. Nothing seems to be  left in here for you to eat, but I'll take a little breakfast myself.\"    He did not relight the fire, but contented himself with cold food. Then  resaddling, he left the grove and rode northward again until he came to  a hill, or, rather, a swell, that was higher than the rest. Here he  stopped his horse and took a glance at the sun, which was shining with  uncommon brilliancy. Then he produced a small mirror from the pocket of  his hunting shirt and held it in such a position that it made a focus of  the sun's rays, throwing them in a perfect blazing lance of light.    He turned the flaming lance around the horizon, until it completed the  circle and then he started around with it again. Meantime he was keeping  a close watch upon every high point. A hill rose in the north, and he  looked at it longest, but nothing came from it. There was another, but  lower, hill in the west, and before he had completed the second round  with his glass a light flashed from it. It was a brilliant light, almost  like a sheaf of white incandescent rays. He lowered his own mirror and  the light played directly upon his hill. When it ceased he sent back  answering rays, to which, when he stopped, a rejoinder came in like  fashion. Then he put the little mirror back in the safe pocket of his  hunting shirt and rode with perfect confidence toward that western hill.    The crest that Ned sought was several miles away, although it looked  much nearer in the thin clear air of the plains, but he rode now at  increased speed, because there was much to draw him on. Old Jack seemed  to share in his lightness of spirit, raising his head once and neighing,  as if he were sending forth a welcome.    The boy soon saw two figures upon the hill, the shapes of horse and man,  outlined in black against the sun, which was now declining in the west.  They were motionless and they were exaggerated into gigantic stature  against the red background. Ned knew them, although the distance was far  too great to disclose any feature. But signal had spoken truly to  signal, and that was enough. Old Jack made a fresh burst of speed and  presently neighed once more. An answering neigh came back from the hill.    Ned rode up the slope and greeted Obed White and the Ring Tailed Panther  with outstretched hands.    \"And it's you, my boy,\" said Obed, his eyes glistening. \"Until we saw  your signal we were afraid that you might have frozen to death in the  Norther, but it's a long lane that has no happy ending, and here we are,  all three of us, alive, and as well as ever.\"    \"That's so,\" said the Panther, \"but even when the storm was at its worst  I didn't give up, Ned. Somehow, when things are at the blackest I'm  always hopin'. I don't take any credit fur it. I was just born with that  kind of a streak in me.\"    Ned regarded him with admiration. The Ring Tailed Panther was certainly  a gorgeous object. He rode a great black horse with a flowing mane. He  was clad completely in a suit of buckskin which was probably without a  match on the border. It and his moccasins were adorned with thick rows  of beads of many colors, that glittered and flashed as the sunlight  played upon them. Heavy silver spurs were fastened to his heels, and his  hat of broad brim and high cone in the Mexican fashion was heavy with  silver braid. His saddle also was of the high, peaked style, studded  with silver. The Panther noticed Ned's smile of appraisement and smiled  back.    \"Ain't it fine?\" he said. \"I guess this is about the beautifullest  outfit to be found in either Texas or Mexico. I bought it all in honor  of our victory just after we took San Antonio, and it soothes my eyes  and makes my heart strong every time I look at it.\"    \"And it helps out the prairies,\" said Obed White, his eyes twinkling.  \"Now that winter has made 'em brown, they need a dash of color and the  Panther gives it to 'em. Fine feathers don't keep a man from "]]]
