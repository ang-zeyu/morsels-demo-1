[Illustration: SIMILAR TO THE KAISER'S AERIAL BODYGUARD: A ZEPPELIN WITH  A GUN ON TOP FIRING AT HOSTILE AEROPLANES--A GERMAN PICTURE.]    It was stated recently that two Zeppelins, armed with machine-guns, circle  continually  on  guard  above  the  Kaiser's  private  apartments  in  his  headquarters at Coblentz.    It  must  be  remembered,  too, that  the  casualties  referred  to--being  confined to  \"the western area of  the war\"--do not include  our losses at  sea, which  comprise few \"wounded\" and  no \"missing.\" At sea  it is either  neck  or  nothing, sink  or  swim:  a  modern  battle-ship, if  holed  and  exploded, like  the Good  Hope and  the Monmouth off  the coast  of Chile,  going to  the bottom,  and most  of her crew  with her,  like Kempenfelt's  oaken Royal George--      Brave Kempenfelt is gone,      His victories are o'er;    And he and his eight hundred      Will plough the waves no more.      Thus if our casualties at sea, which are mainly of one kind only, be added  up,  they will  probably be  found  to exceed  our deaths  on land,  which  are  always  much less  numerous  than  other  kinds  of losses;  yet  the  mortality of our  battlefields has been mournful  enough, especially among  officers--where the death percentage has been higher than in any other war  we ever waged.    On  the other  hand, the  Germans  have had  to  pay a  fearful price  for  the  death-toll they  have  exacted of  us and  our  Allies, seeing  that,  according to their own official admission,  their casualties to the end of  September amounted to over 500,000 for  the Prussian army alone, while the  corresponding  figures for  Bavaria, Wuertemberg,  Baden, and  other States  have to  be added;  so that the  estimate of Mr.  Hilaire Belloc  that the  total losses of  the Germans up to  date must be somewhere  near a million  and three-quarters men would appear to be not very far out.    Well now, supposing  that the war were  to last for two  years, it follows  that, at  the same  rate of  loss, the German  casualties would  amount to  12,250,000, which  is almost unthinkable. Its  very destructiveness should  tend to shorten the duration of this  terrible war. As Mr. Asquith said at  the opening of Parliament, in a curiously cryptic and significant passage:  \"The war  may last long. I  doubt myself if it  will last as long  as many  people originally predicted.\" God grant that this may be so!    But in  the meantime there are  no signs of  any abatement of fury  on the  part of the Imperial Hun of Berlin, who stamps, and struts, and rages like  Pistol on the field of Agincourt; and \"Bid him prepare, for I will cut his  throat!\" is  ever the burden of  his objurgations. How different  from the  calm, serene, dignified  utterances of our own gracious  Sovereign and the  despatches of  his Generals are the  minatory rantings of the  Kaiser, his  von Klucks, and  his Crown Princes of Bavaria, with  their vicious appeals  to the  worst passions of their  soldiers against the English  as the most  bitterly hated of all their foes!

To enumerate his  qualities: indomitable  courage, keen  intelligence, broad humanity,  is to gild refined  gold. At  the call of  duty he visited the  Army and the Indian  soldiers in France,  despite  his  eighty-two  years;  there  he  caught  a  chill  and  passed  peacefully away.  The message to  Lady Roberts by Field-Marshall  Sir John  French will find universal echo: \"...Your  grief is shared by us who mourn  the loss of a much-loved chief ... It seems a fitter ending to the life of  so great  a soldier that he  should have passed  away in the midst  of the  troops he loved so well and within the sound of the guns.\"          __________________________________________________________________________  6--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.      [Illustration: THE \"NIGER'S\" CAPTAIN, WHO STAYED ON THE BRIDGE TO THE  LAST THOUGH BADLY WOUNDED: LIEUT.-COMMANDER A.P. MUIR.]    When the  \"Niger\" was torpedoed,  Captain Muir was  on the bridge  and was  severely injured  by the explosion,  but remained  at his post  till every  officer and man had  left the ship. He was taken ashore at  Deal in a boat  and had to be at once placed in hospital.--[Photo. by Russell.]    Most bitterly hated, but at the  same time most formidable--as the Germans  themselves now  generally admit, and  hence all those tears  of rage--hinc  illae lacrymae. Even when the Prussian Guards--not to speak of the vaunted  Brandenburgers and Bavarians--can make no  impression on the British lines  in Belgium, it should at last break  in upon the German General Staff that  they are  somewhat out in  their calculations. The word  \"contemptible\" is  never used now in relation to Sir  John French's army, and it will be used  still less when this army shall have been reinforced by the million of men  apart altogether  from the  Territorials which are  now under  training to  supplement it,  while a further million  has now, in turn,  been asked for  and will  be cheerfully raised,  with the help  of the additional  vote of  credit for  L250,000,000--which was just about  the cost of the  Boer War,  and  L25,000,000 more  than the  French indemnity  of 1870--which  will be  willingly granted by Parliament  for the conduct of a war  that is said to  be costing  us about L7,000,000  a week. When a  young man throws  all his  soul  into his  training  and  ardently wants  to  become  a soldier,  his  progress will be at least three times as quick as that of the dull, driven  conscript;  and that  is  why Lord  Kitchener  has told  us  that the  new  million-man'd army which popularly bears his name, though it might just as  well be called after the King--has already been making a wonderful advance  towards field-efficiency.      [Illustration: SUNK BY A GERMAN SUBMARINE IN THE DOWNS: H.M.S. \"NIGER.\"]    The \"Niger,\" a  torpedo-gunboat of 810 tons, built in  1892, was torpedoed  by a  German submarine while  lying off Deal about  noon on the  11th, and  foundered. The Admiralty stated: \"All the  officers and 77 of the men were  saved; two of the men are severely and two slightly injured. It is thought  there was no loss of life.\"--[Photo. by L.N.A.]    The  English  writer  of  one  of   the  many  war-books  now  before  the  public--\"The German Army From  Within,\" by one who has served  in it as an  officer, tells us that  he calculates one of our \"Tommies\"  to be at least  equal to three \"Hans Wursts\"; and when the personal equation is taken into  account--the value  of individual  character and  initiative--the estimate  will not seem to be exaggerated. In fact, it has been proved to be correct  by the opinion of  all our best judges in the field itself,  as well as by  the results of the fighting when  the odds against us have been invariably  three  to one,  in spite  of which  we have  always managed,  not only  to  maintain our ground, but also to encroach on that of our antagonists.    Hence it follows that a so-called  \"Kitchener\" army of a million men ought  to have for us a military value  of at least three millions as against the  Germans--the more so since their  best first-line troops have already been  used up, and  replaced with beardless boys and  most corpulent greybeards.  This is not  a fanciful description; it corresponds with  the reports sent  home by \"Eye-Witness\" at Headquarters  and other reliable observers; while  there is  an absolute  consensus of  statement that  our soldiers  enjoy a  commissariat  system which  is  at  once the  admiration  of their  French  friends and  the sheer  envy and  despair of their  German foes.  The fact  alone that our  men are better found  and better fed than  the enemy gives  them  an advantage  over and  above their  three-to-one equivalent  of the  individual kind.

Wrecked and  ruined houses  with their  walls leaning  over and  tottering, about to fall in ruin, and  the heaps of littered debris in the  street tell a fearful  tale of what the havoc from  a bombardment by heavy  projectiles means for the hapless inhabitants of the place. The tremendous  force of the impact with which the  shells crash down is shown at the same  time by the  man seen in the  foreground of the photograph  standing up to  the waist in one of the gaping cavities in the ground that the shells make  where they strike. In  some of the houses they smash  through from roof to  cellar.--[Photo. by Illus.

Their hate is  the measure of  their fear.... Whatever feats of arms  the German Navy may  hereafter  perform, the  stigma of  the baby-killers  of Scarborough  will  brand its officers and men while sailors sail the seas.\"    [Illustration: A GERMAN ISLAND ADDED TO THE EMPIRE BY THE AUSTRALIAN  FORCES: READING THE BRITISH PROCLAMATION AT RABAUL, NEU POMMERN.    The Australian Squadron arrived at Herbertshoehe, Neu Pommern, on September  11. After some fighting, the Germans surrendered, and, two days later, the  Union Jack was hoisted at Rabaul, the German capital. The proclamation was  read  by Major  Francis Heritage  (facing Colonel  W. Holmes,  the central  figure in the  photograph). For the benefit of the  natives an address was  given in  amusing \"pidgin\" English  (see the  \"Times,\"  November  16). Neu  Pommern (formerly New Britain) is just east of New Guinea.]    Other  attempts  at  \"frightful  frightfulness\"   on  the  part  of  these  \"baby-killers\"  were  a  couple  of aeroplane  raids--of  which  the  base  was  probably  Ostend--carried out  on  Christmas  Eve and  Christmas  Day  respectively--against Dover and Sheerness. It must be owned that they were  decidedly daring,  yet in the nature  of damp-squib affairs, as  it turned  out. In the case of Dover, the  bomb dropped was probably intended for the  Castle--a pretty conspicuous target, though all  it did was to disturb the  soil of  a cabbage-garden, and  excite the pursuit  of several of  our own  air-craft, which  lost their  seaward-soaring quarry  in the  fog brooding  over the Channel; while in the case of the Sheerness invader, on Christmas  Day, which made  its appearance just as the visitors  at Southend over the  water  were about  to sit  down to  their turkey  and plum-pudding--little  dreaming of  the extra  dish of enjoyment  which was thus  to be  added to  their menu--it was at once tackled, as at Dover, by some of our own airmen  and pelted  with shot, being hit  three or four times;  though this aerial  intruder also  managed, in  the mist, to  show a clean  pair of  heels, or  wings,  and make  off  eastward.  These were  the  German  replies to  our  bomb-dropping raids on Duesseldorf and Friedrichs-hafen, and intended to be  a foretaste of  what we may expect in the  shape of German \"frightfulness\"  as prompted by the \"insensate hatred\" referred to by Mr. Churchill.    Daring enough in themselves, those German visitations seemed insignificant  by  comparison  with  the  raids  which  were  being  carried  out  almost  simultaneously on the other  side of the sea by our  own naval airmen. For  while the German aeroplanist was helping to dig a cabbage garden at Dover,  one of  our Squadron-Commanders--R.B. Davies, R.N.--from  a Maurice-Farman  biplane  was  much more  profitably  engaged  in  dropping a  dozen  bombs  on  a  Zeppelin shed  at  Brussels--causing  \"clouds  of smoke\"  to  arise  therefrom--most probably from the flames of the incendiarised air-ship.          __________________________________________________________________________                       THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914--[Part 21]--5    [Illustration: THE AIR-RAID ON GERMAN WAR-SHIPS OFF CUXHAVEN: BRITISH  SEA-PLANES, SISTERS TO THOSE WHICH TOOK PART IN THE BRILLIANT EXPLOIT.]    The sea-planes came  into great prominence, for the first  time during the  war, on Christmas Day, when seven  of them attacked German war-ships lying  in Schillig  Roads, off Cuxhaven. The  attack started from a  point in the  vicinity of Heligoland, and the air-craft were escorted by a light-cruiser  and destroyer force, together with submarines. The enemy put up a fight by  means  of two  Zeppelins,  three  or  four  bomb-dropping sea-planes,  and  several submarines.  Six out  of the  seven pilots  returned safely--three  were  re-embarked by  our  ships,  and three  were  picked  up by  British  submarines.  Flight-Commander Francis  E.T.  Hewlett,  R.N., was  reported  missing. In  our first  photograph a  sea-plane is  being conveyed  to her  parent  ship;  in the  second  and  third,  sea-planes are  being  hoisted  aboard.--[_Photos. by S. and G._]          __________________________________________________________________________  6--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      But  that  was  nothing  to  the  Christmas  Day  feat  of  seven  of  our  sea-planes--one for  every day  of the  week--which, accompanied  by light  cruisers  and  destroyers, with  several  submarines,  made a  daring  and  unparalleled attack  on Cuxhaven, at  the mouth  of the Elbe,  and several  war-ships  lying at  anchor  there--unparalleled, by  reason  of the  fact  that  this was  the first  \"combined  assault of  all arms\"  known to  the  sea--namely, from  the air, the water,  and from under the  water. Both at  Yarmouth and Scarborough the German  bombarding cruisers were so nervously  afraid of  being caught in the  act that they  may almost be said  to have  only fired their guns and then run  away again. But our triple flotilla at  the mouth of the Elbe spent a deliberate three hours in the performance of  its task,  and then  calmly withdrew  with only one  of the  daring pilots  missing. So far,  it was the most  thrilling episode of the  war, and must  give our enemies \"furiously to think,\" in addition to furnishing them with  much more  for the  nourishment of  their hate.  Of this  insensate hatred  against us  in the hearts  of the German  people--and all because  we have  \"queered their  pitch,\" or  crossed their  long-cherished schemes  for the  destruction of  our Empire--the  most furious  exponent is  the _Koelnische  Zeitung_,  or  _Cologne  Gazette_,  as we  generally  call  it--which  may  be  described, on  the  whole,  as the  most  authoritative  organ of  the  Fatherland--or the _Times_  of Germany, but always with  a difference. The  curious anomaly is that the seat of this powerful journal should be so far  away  from  the capital--at  Cologne.  There  is  an old  story--known  to  tourists who read  their guide-books--about the \"Three  Kings of Cologne,\"  but now  this story has just  received a pendant which  gives anything but  satisfaction at Cologne itself or anywhere else in Germany.

Ingenious French engineers,  for example, have constructed warm  shower-baths, hair-dressing  saloons, and similar conveniences,  while the  British \"Eye-Witness\"  was able to write  recently of our own  lines: \"The  trenches themselves  are heated  by braziers and  stoves and  floored with  straw, bricks and  boards. Behind them are shelters and  dug-outs of every  description most  ingeniously contrived.\" The above  French cartoon, which  is  from \"La  Vie Parisienne,\"  is  headed \"La  Guerre des  Taubes et  des  Taupes\" (moles).          __________________________________________________________________________  8--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      kingdoms,  but that  an agreement  had  also been  reached concerning  the  special  questions raised\"--a  result which  must have  been anything  but  agreeable  to  the  War-Lord  of  Potsdam,  who  had  been  thirsting  for  _Weltmacht_, or world-dominion, and casting about to pave the way for this  result by absorbing the minor States  of Northern Europe--as a shark would  open its voracious jaws to swallow down a shoal of minnows, or other small  fry. That this was a prominent plank in the platform of German policy must  be clear to all  who have read the diplomatic revelations  of the last few  months; but  now the \"Three Kings  of Scandinavia,\" going one  better than  their storied colleagues of Cologne, have shown that they are as obtuse to  the blandishments of Berlin as the journalists of New "]]]
