Experience with patients soon proves to us nurses that the weal  and woe of the one vitally affects the other.    \"Psychology is the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and  their conditions.\"    So William James took up the burden of proof some thirty years ago, and  assured a doubting world of men and women that there were laws in the  realm of mind as certain and dependable as those applying to the world  of matter--men and women who were not at all sure they had any right to  get near enough the center of things to see the wheels go round. But  today thousands of people are trying to find out something of the way  the mind is conceived, and to understand its workings. And many of us  have in our impatient, hasty investigation, self-analytically taken our  mental machines all to pieces and are trying effortfully to put them  together again. Some of us have made a pretty bad mess of it, for we  tore out the screws and pulled apart the adjustments so hastily and  carelessly that we cannot now find how they fit. And millions of other  machines are working wrong because the engineers do not know how to keep  them in order, put them in repair, or even what levers operate them. So  books must be written--books of directions.    If you can glibly recite the definition above, know and explain the  meaning of \"mental life,\" describe \"its phenomena and their conditions,\"  illustrating from real life; if you can do this, and prove that  psychology is a science, _i. e._, an organized system of knowledge on  the workings of the mind--not mere speculation or plausible theory--then  you are a psychologist, and can make your own definitions. Indeed, the  test of the value of a course such as this should be your ability, at  its end, to tell clearly, in a few words of your own, what psychology  is.    The word _science_ comes from a Latin root, _scir_, the infinitive form,  _scire_, meaning to know. So a science is simply the accumulated, tested  knowledge, the proved group of facts about a subject, all that is known  of that subject to date. Hence, if psychology is a _science_, it is no  longer a thing of guesses or theories, but is a grouping of confirmed  facts about the mind, facts proved in the psychology laboratory even as  chemical facts are demonstrated in the chemical laboratory. Wherein  psychology departs from facts which can be proved by actual experience  or by accurate tests, it becomes metaphysics, and is beyond the realm of  science; for metaphysics deals with the realities of the supermind, or  the soul, and its relations to life, and death, and God. Physics,  chemistry, biology have all in their day been merely speculative. They  were bodies of theory which might prove true or might not. When they  _worked_, by actually being tried out, they became bodies of accepted  facts, and are today called sciences. In the same way the laws of the  working of the mind have been tested, and a body of assured facts about  it has taken its place with other sciences.    It must be admitted that no psychologist is willing to stop with the  _known_ and _proved_, but, when he has presented that, dips into the  fascinations of the yet unknown, and works with promising theory, which  tomorrow may prove to be science also. But we will first find what they  have verified, and make that the safe foundation for our own  understanding of ourselves and others.    What do we mean by \"mental life\"?--or, we might say, the science of the  life of the mind. And what is _mind_?    But let us start our quest by asking first what reasons we have for  being sure mind exists. We find the proof of it in consciousness,  although we shall learn later that the activities of the mind may at  times be unconscious. So where consciousness is, we know there is mind;  but where consciousness is not, we must find whether it has been, and is  only temporarily withdrawn, before we say \"Mind is not here.\" And  _consciousness_ we might call _awareness_, or our personal recognition  of being--awareness of me, and thee, and it. So we recognize _mind_ by  its evidences of awareness, _i. e._, by the body's reaction to stimuli;  and we find mind at the very dawn of animal life.    Consciousness is evidenced in the protozooen, the simplest form in which  animal life is known to exist, by what we call its response to stimuli.  The protozooen has a limited power of self-movement, and will accept or  reject certain environments. But while we see that mind expresses itself  in consciousness as vague, as dubious as that of the protozooen, we find  it also as clear, as definite, as far reaching as that of the statesman,  the chemist, the philosopher. Hence, the \"phenomena of mental life\"  embrace the entire realms of feeling, knowing, willing--not of man  alone, but of all creatures.    In our study, however, we shall limit ourselves to the psychology of the  human mind, since that concerns us vitally as nurses. Animal psychology,  race psychology, comparative psychology are not within the realm of our  practical needs in hospital life. We would know the workings of man's  mind in disease and health. What are the instinctive responses to fear,  as shown by babies and children and primitive races? What are the normal  expressions of joy, of anger, or desire? What external conditions call  forth these evidences? What are the acquired responses to the things  which originally caused fear, or joy, or anger? How do grown-ups differ  in their reactions to the same stimuli? Why do they differ? Why does one  man walk firmly, with stern, set face, to meet danger? Why does another  quake and run? Why does a third man approach it with a swagger, face it  with a confident, reckless smile of defiance?    All these are legitimate questions for the psychologist. He will  approach the study of man's mind by finding how his body acts--that is,  by watching the phenomena of mental life--under various conditions; then  he will seek for the \"why\" of the action. For we can only conclude what  is in the mind of another by interpreting his expression of his thinking  and feeling. We cannot see within his mind. But experience with  ourselves and others has taught us that certain attitudes of body,  certain shades of countenance, certain gestures, tones of voice,  spontaneous or willed actions, represent anger or joy, impatience or  irritability, stern control or poise of mind. We realize that the  average man has learned to conceal his mental reactions from the casual  observer at will. But if we see him at an unguarded moment, we can very  often get a fair idea of his mental attitude. Through these outward  expressions we are able to judge to some extent of the phenomena of his  mental life. But let us list them from our own minds as they occur to us  this work-a-day moment, then, later on, find what elements go to make up  the present consciousness.    As I turn my thoughts inward at this instant I am aware of these mental  impressions passing in review:    You nurses for whom I am writing.    The hospitals you represent.    What you already know or do not know along these lines.    A child calling on the street some distance away.    A brilliant sunshine bringing out the sheen of the green grass.    The unmelodious call of a flicker in the pine-tree, and a towhee singing  in the distance.    A whistling wind bending the pines.    A desire to throw work aside and go for a long tramp.    A patient moving about overhead (she is supposed to be out for her walk,  and I'm wondering why she is not).    The face and voice of an old friend whom I was just now called from my  work to see.    The plan and details of my writing.    The face and gestures of my old psychology professor and the assembled  class engaged in a tangling metaphysic discussion.    A cramped position.    Some loose hair about my face distracting me.    An engagement at 7.30.    A sharp resolve to stop wool-gathering and finish this chapter.    And yet, until I stopped to examine my consciousness, I was keenly aware  _only_ of the thoughts on psychology I was trying to put on paper.    But how shall we classify these various contents?    Some are _emotion_, _i. e._, feelings; others are _intellect_, _i. e._,  thoughts; still others represent _determination_, _i. e._, volition or  will.    There is nothing in this varied consciousness that will not be included  in one or another of these headings. Let us group the contents for  ourselves.    The nurses for whom I am writing:    A result of memory and of imagination (both intellect). A sense of  kinship and interest in them (emotion). A determination that they must  have my best (will, volition).    And so of the hospitals:    My memory of hospitals I have known, and my mental picture of yours made  up from piecing together the memories of various ones, the recollection  of the feelings I had in them, etc. (intellect).    What you already know.    Speculation (intellect), the speculation based on my knowledge of other  schools (memory which is intellect). A desire (emotion) that all nurses  should know psychology.    Child calling on street.    Recognition of sound (intellect) and pleasant perception of his voice  (emotion).    Desire to throw work aside and go for a tramp on this gorgeous day.    Emotion, restrained by stronger emotion of interest in work at hand, and  _intellect_, which tells me that this is a work hour--and _will_, which  orders me to pay attention to duties at hand.    So all the phenomena of mental life are included in feelings, thoughts,  and volitions which accompany every minute of my waking life, and  probably invade secretly every second of my sleeping life.    The conditions of mental life--what are they?    1. In man and the higher animals the central nervous system, which,  anatomy teaches us, consists of the brain and spinal cord.

If fifteen  years ago I could have seen it in good company, with a well-informed  guide, I should have thought myself very fortunate. But as it was to be  that I should thus see it alone, and with my own eyes, it is well that  this joy has fallen to my lot so late in life.    Over the mountains of the Tyrol I have as good as flown. Verona,  Vicenza, Padua, and Venice I have carefully looked at; hastily glanced  at Ferrara, Cento, Bologna, and scarcely seen Florence at all. My  anxiety to reach Rome was so great, and it so grew with me every moment,  that to think of stopping anywhere was quite out of the question; even  in Florence, I only stayed three hours. Now I am here at my ease, and as  it would seem, shall be tranquilized for my whole life; for we may  almost say that a new life begins when a man once sees with his own eyes  all that before he has but partially heard or read of.    All the dreams of my youth I now behold realized before me; the subjects  of the first engravings I ever remembered seeing (several views of Rome  were hung up in an anteroom of my father's house) stand bodily before my  sight, and all that I had long been acquainted with, through paintings  or drawings, engravings, or wood-cuts, plaster-casts, and cork models  are here collectively presented to my eye. Wherever I go I find some old  acquaintance in this new world; it is all just as I had thought it, and  yet all is new; and just the same might I remark of my own observations  and my own ideas. I have not gained any new thoughts, but the older ones  have become so defined, so vivid, and so coherent, that they may almost  pass for new ones....    I have now been here seven days, and by degrees have formed in my mind a  general idea of the city. We go diligently backward and forward. While I  am thus making myself acquainted with the plan of old and new Rome,  viewing the ruins and the buildings, visiting this and that villa, the  grandest and most remarkable objects are slowly and leisurely  contemplated. I do but keep my eyes open and see, and then go and come  again, for it is only in Rome one can duly prepare oneself for Rome. It  must, in truth, be confessed, that it is a sad and melancholy business  to prick and track out ancient Rome in new Rome; however, it must be  done, and we may hope at least for an incalculable gratification. We  meet with traces both of majesty and of ruin, which alike surpass all  conception; what the barbarians spared, the builders of new Rome made  havoc of....    When one thus beholds an object two thousand years old and more, but so  manifoldly and thoroughly altered by the changes of time, but, sees  nevertheless, the same soil, the same mountains, and often indeed the  same walls and columns, one becomes, as it were, a contemporary of the  great counsels of Fortune, and thus it becomes difficult for the  observer to trace from the beginning Rome following Rome, and not only  new Rome succeeding to the old, but also the several epochs of both old  and new in succession. I endeavor, first of all, to grope my way alone  through the obscurer parts, for this is the only plan by which one can  hope fully and completely to perfect by the excellent introductory works  which have been written from the fifteenth century to the present day.  The first artists and scholars have occupied their whole lives with  these objects.    And this vastness has a strangely tranquilizing effect upon you in Rome,  while you pass from place to place, in order to visit the most  remarkable objects. In other places one has to search for what is  important; here one is opprest, and borne down with numberless  phenomena. Wherever one goes and casts a look around, the eye is at once  struck with some landscape--forms of every kind and style; palaces and  ruins, gardens and statuary, distant views of villas, cottages and  stables, triumphal arches and columns, often crowding so close together,  that they might all be sketched on a single sheet of paper. He ought to  have a hundred hands to write, for what can a single pen do here; and,  besides, by the evening one is quite weary and exhausted with the day's  seeing and admiring.    My strange, and perhaps whimsical, incognito proves useful to me in many  ways that I never should have thought of. As every one thinks himself in  duty bound to ignore who I am, and consequently never ventures to speak  to me of myself and my works,[2] they have no alternative left them but  to speak of themselves, or of the matters in which they are most  interested, and in this way I become circumstantially informed of the  occupations of each, and of everything remarkable that is either taken  in hand or produced. Hofrath Reiffenstein good-naturedly humors this  whim of mine; as, however, for special reasons, he could not bear the  name which I had assumed, he immediately made a Baron of me, and I am  now called the \"Baron gegen Rondanini ueber\" (the Baron who lives  opposite to the Palace Rondanini). This designation is sufficiently  precise, especially as the Italians are accustomed to speak of people  either by their Christian names, or else by some nickname. Enough; I  have gained my object; and I escape the dreadful annoyance of having to  give to everybody an account of myself and my works....    In Rome, the Rotunda,[3] both by its exterior and interior, has moved me  to offer a willing homage to its magnificence. In St. Peter's I learned  to understand how art, no less than nature, annihilates the artificial  measures and dimensions of man. And in the same way the Apollo Belvidere  also has again drawn me out of reality. For as even the most correct  engravings furnish no adequate idea of these buildings, so the case is  the same with respect to the marble original of this statue, as compared  with the plaster models of it, which, however, I formerly used to look  upon as beautiful.    Here I am now living with a calmness and tranquility to which I have for  a long while been a stranger. My practise to see and take all things as  they are, my fidelity in letting the eye be my light, my perfect  renunciation of all pretension, have again come to my aid, and make me  calmly, but most intensely, happy. Every day has its fresh remarkable  object--every day its new grand unequaled paintings,"]]]
