Lombroso holds the opinion that if men of genius are not all more  or less insane, that is, if the \"spheres of influence\" of genius and  insanity do not actually overlap, they are at least contiguous at many  points, so that the transition from the former to the latter is  extremely easy and even natural. But genius in itself is not an abnormal  mental condition. It does not even consist of an extraordinary memory,  vivid imagination, quickness of judgment, or of a combination of all of  these. Kant defines genius as the talent of invention. Originality and  productiveness are the fundamental elements of genius. And it is an  almost instinctive force which urges the author on in his creative work.  In the main his activity is due less to free will than to this inner  compulsion.        \"Ich halte diesen Drang vergebens auf,      Der Tag und Nacht in meinem Busen wechselt.      Wenn ich nicht sinnen oder dichten soll,      So ist das Leben mir kein Leben mehr,\"    says Goethe's Tasso.[5] If this impulse of genius is embodied in a  strong physical organism, as for example in the case of Shakespeare and  Goethe, there need be no detriment to physical health; otherwise, and  especially if there is an inherited tendency to disease, there is almost  sure to be a physical collapse. Specialists in the subject have pointed  out that violent passions are even more potent in producing mental  disease than mere intellectual over-exertion. And these are certainly  characteristic in a very high degree of the mind of genius. It has often  been remarked that it is the _corona spinosa_ of genius to feel all pain  more intensely than do other men. Schopenhauer says \"der, in welchem der  Genius lebt, leidet am meisten.\" It is only going a step further then,  when Hamerling writes to his friend Moeser: \"Schliesslich ist es doch nur  der Kranke, der sich das Leid der ganzen Welt zu Herzen nimmt.\"    Radestock, in his study \"Genie und Wahnsinn,\" mentions and elaborates  among others the following points of resemblance between the mind of  genius and the insane mind: an abnormal activity of the imagination,  very rapid succession of ideas, extreme concentration of thought upon a  single subject or idea, and lastly, what would seem the cardinal point,  a weakness of will-energy, the lack of that force which alone can serve  to bring under control all these other unruly elements and give balance  to what must otherwise be an extremely one-sided mechanism. Here again  the exception may be taken to prove the rule. It is not too much, I  think, to assert that Goethe could never have become so uniquely great,  not even through the splendid versatility of his genius, but for that  incomparable self-control, which he made the watchword of his life. And  in the case of the poet of Weltschmerz the presence or absence of this  quality may even decide whether he shall rise superior to his beclouded  condition or perish in the gloom. The conclusion at which Radestock  arrives is that genius, as the expression of the most intense mental  activity, occupies the middle ground, as it were, between the normal  healthy state on the one hand, and the abnormal, pathological state on  the other, and has without doubt many points of contact with mental  disease; and that although the elements which genius has in common with  insanity may not be strong enough in themselves to induce the transition  from the former to the latter state, yet when other aggravating causes  are added, such as physical disease, violent emotions or passions,  overwork, the pressure or distress of outward circumstances, the highly  gifted individual is much more liable to cross the line of demarkation  between the two mental states than is the average mind, which is more  remote from that line. If this can be asserted of genius in general, it  must be even more particularly and widely applicable in reference to a  combination of genius and Weltschmerz. We shall find pathetic examples  in the first two types selected for examination.    Having thus introduced the subject in its most general bearings and  aspects, it remains for us to review briefly its historical background.    Weltschmerz is essentially a symptom of a period of conflict, of  transition. The powerful reaction which marks the eighteenth century--a  reaction against all traditional intellectual authority, and a struggle  for the emancipation of the individual, of research, of inspiration and  of genius--reached its high-water mark in Germany in the seventies. But  with the unrestrained outbursts of the champions of Storm and Stress the  problem was by no means solved; there remained the basic conflict  between the idea of personal liberty and the strait-jacket of  Frederician absolutism, the conflict between the dynastic and the  national idea of the state. Should the individual yield a blind,  unreasoned submission to the state as to a divinely instituted arbitrary  authority, good or bad, or was the state to be regarded as the conscious  and voluntary cooeperation of its subjects for the general good? It was,  moreover, a time not only of open and active revolt, as represented by  the spirit of Klinger, but also of great emotional stirrings, and  sentimental yearnings of such passive natures as Hoelty. Rousseau's plea  for a simplified and more natural life had exerted a mighty influence.  And what has a most important bearing upon the relation between these  intellectual currents and Weltschmerz--these minds were lacking in the  discipline implied in our modern scientific training. Scientific  exactness of thinking had not become an integral part of education.  Hence the difference between the pessimism of Ibsen and the romantic  Weltschmerz of these uncritical minds.    In accounting for the tremendous effect produced by his \"Werther,\"  Goethe compares his work to the bit of fuse which explodes the mine, and  says that the shock of the explosion was so great because the young  generation of the day had already undermined itself, and its members  now burst forth individually with their exaggerated demands, unsatisfied  passions and imaginary sufferings.[6] And in estimating the influences  which had prepared the way for this mental disposition, Goethe  emphasizes the influence of English literature. Young's \"Night  Thoughts,\" Gray's \"Elegy,\" Goldsmith's \"Deserted Village,\" even \"Hamlet\"  and his monologues haunted all minds. \"Everyone knew the principal  passages by heart, and everyone believed he had a right to be just as  melancholy as the Prince of Denmark, even though he had seen no ghost  and had no royal father to avenge.\" Finally Ossian had provided an  eminently suitable setting,--under the darkly lowering sky the endless  gray heath, peopled with the shadowy forms of departed heroes and  withered maidens. To quote the substance of Goethe's criticism:[7] Amid  such influences and surroundings, occupied with fads and studies of this  sort, lacking all incentive from without to any important activity and  confronted by the sole prospect of having to drag out a humdrum  existence, men began to reflect with a sort of sullen exultation upon  the possibility of departing this life at will, and to find in this  thought a scant amelioration of the ills and tedium of the times. This  disposition was so general that \"Werther\" itself exerted a powerful  influence, because it everywhere struck a responsive chord and publicly  and tangibly exhibited the true inwardness of a morbid youthful  illusion.[8]    Nor did the dawning nineteenth century bring relief. No other period of  Prussian history, says Heinrich von Treitschke,[9] is wrapped in so deep  a gloom as the first decade of the reign of Frederick William III. It  was a time rich in hidden intellectual forces, and yet it bore the stamp  of that uninspired Philistinism which is so abundantly evidenced by the  barren commonplace character of its architecture and art. Genius there  was, indeed, but never were its opportunities for public usefulness more  limited. It was as though the greatness of the days of the second  Frederick lay like a paralyzing weight upon this generation. And this  oppressing sense of impotence was followed, after the Napoleonic Wars,  by the bitterness of disappointment, all the more keenly felt by reason  of this first reawakening of the national consciousness. Great had been  the expectations, enormous the sacrifice; exceedingly small was the gain  to the individual.[10] And the resultant dissonance was the same as that  to which Alfred de Musset gave expression in the words: \"The malady of  the present century is due to two causes; the people who have passed  through 1793 and 1814 bear in their hearts two wounds. All that was is  no more; all that will be is not yet. Do not hope to find elsewhere the  secret of our ills.\"[11]    This then in briefest outline is the transition from the century of  individualism and autocracy to the nineteenth century of democracy.  Small wonder that the struggle claimed its victims in those individuals  who, unable to find a firm basis of conviction and principle, vacillated  constantly between instinctive adherence to old traditions, and  unreasoned inclination to the new order of things.

AEsthetically, she is  now even more attractive than her child, whose seriousness, in such  pictures, takes something from his childlikeness. Chronologically, our  list reads backwards, as the religious aspect of Mary's motherhood was  the first treated in art, while the naturalistic conception came last.  Regarded as expressive of national characteristics, the Mater Amabilis  is the Madonna best beloved in northern countries, while the other two  subjects belong specially to the art of the south.    It will be seen that any number of Madonna pictures, having been  arranged in the five groups designated in Part I., may be gathered up  and redistributed in the three classes of Part II. To make this clear,  the pictures mentioned in the first method of classification are  frequently referred to a second time, viewed from an entirely  different standpoint. Since the lines of cleavage are so widely  dissimilar in the two cases, both methods of study are necessary to a  complete understanding of a picture. By the first, we learn a  convenient term of description by which we may casually designate a  Madonna; by the second, we find its highest meaning as a work of art,  and are admitted to some new secret of a mother's love.          PART I.    MADONNAS CLASSED BY THE STYLE OF COMPOSITION.          THE MADONNA IN ART.    CHAPTER I.    THE PORTRAIT MADONNA.      The first Madonna pictures known to us are of the portrait style, and  are of Byzantine or Greek origin. They were brought to Rome and the  western empire from Constantinople (the ancient Byzantium), the  capital of the eastern empire, where a new school of Christian art had  developed out of that of ancient Greece. Justinian's conquest of Italy  sowed the new art-seed in a fertile field, where it soon took root and  multiplied rapidly. There was, however, little or no improvement in  the type for a long period; it remained practically unchanged till  the thirteenth century. Thus, while a Byzantine Madonna is to be found  in nearly every old church in Italy, to see one is to see all. They  are half-length figures against a background of gold leaf, at first  laid on solidly, or, at a somewhat later date, studded with cherubs.  The Virgin has a meagre, ascetic countenance, large, ill-shaped eyes,  and an almost peevish expression; her head is draped in a heavy, dark  blue veil, falling in stiff folds.    Unattractive as such pictures are to us from an artistic standpoint,  they inspire us with respect if not with reverence. Once objects of  mingled devotion and admiration, they are still regarded with awe by  many who can no longer admire. Their real origin being lost in  obscurity, innumerable legends have arisen, attributing them to  miraculous agencies, and also endowing them with power to work  miracles. There is an early and widespread tradition, imported with  the Madonna from the East, which makes St. Luke a painter. It is said  that he painted many portraits of the Virgin, and, naturally, all the  churches possessing old Byzantine pictures claim that they are genuine  works from the hand of the evangelist. There is one in the Ara Coeli  at Rome, and another in S. Maria in Cosmedino, of which marvellous  tales are told, besides others of great sanctity in St. Mark's,  Venice, and in Padua.    It would not be interesting to dwell, in any detail, upon these  curious old pictures. We would do better to take our first example  from the art which, though founded on Byzantine types, had begun to  learn of nature. Such a picture we find in the Venice Academy, by  Jacopo Bellini, painted at the beginning of the fifteenth century,  somewhat later than any corresponding picture could have been found  elsewhere in Italy, as Venice was chronologically behind the other art  schools. The background is a glory of cherub heads touched with gold  hatching. Both mother and child wear heavy nimbi, ornamented with  gold. These points recall Byzantine work; but the gentler face of the  Virgin, and the graceful fall of her drapery, show that we are in a  different world of art. The child is dressed in a little tunic, in the  primitive method.    With the dawn of the Italian Renaissance, the old style of portrait  Madonna passed out of vogue. More elaborate backgrounds were  introduced from the growing resources of technique. In the fifteenth  and sixteenth centuries, pictures of the portrait style were  comparatively rare. Raphael, however, was not above adopting this  method, as every lover of the Granduca Madonna will remember. His  friend Bartolommeo also selected this style of composition for some of  the loveliest of his works.    [Illustration: JACOPO BELLINI.--MADONNA AND CHILD.]    The story of the friendship between these two men is full of interest.  At the time of Raphael's first appearance in Florence (1504),  Bartolommeo had been four years a monk, and had laid aside, apparently  forever, the brush he had previously wielded with such promise. The  young stranger sought the Frate in his cell at San Marco, and soon  found the way to his heart. Stimulated by this new friendship,  Bartolommeo roused himself from lethargy and resumed the practice of  art with increasing success. It is pleasant to trace the influence  which the two artists exerted upon each other. The older man had  experience and learning; the younger had enthusiasm and genius. Now it  happened that, by nature, Bartolommeo was specially gifted in the  arrangement of large compositions, with many figures and stately  architectural backgrounds. It is by these that he is chiefly known  to-day. So it is the more interesting that, when Raphael's sweet  simplicity first touched him, he turned aside, for the time, from  these elaborate plans and gave himself to the portrayal of the Madonna  in that simplest possible way, the half-length portrait picture.  Several of these he painted upon the walls of his own convent,  glorifying that dim place of prayer and fasting with visions of  radiant and happy motherhood. One of these may still be seen in the  cell sometimes called the Capella Giovanato. It instantly recalls the  Tempi Madonna of Raphael, both in the pose of the figure and in the  genuineness of feeling exhibited. Damp and decay have warred in vain  against it, and the modern visitor lingers before the Mother and Babe  with hushed admiration.    Two other similar frescoes have been removed to the Academy. They show  the same motherly tenderness, the same innocent and beautiful  babyhood. The mother holds her child close in her arms, pressing her  forehead to his, or bending her cheek to receive his kiss. He throws  his little arm about her neck, clinging to her veil or caressing her  face.    Besides this group of pictures by Bartolommeo, there are other  scattered instances of portrait Madonnas during the Italian  Renaissance, by men too great to be tied to the fashions of their day.  Mantegna was such a painter, and Luini another. All told, however,  their pictures of this sort make up a class too rare to deserve longer  description.    A century later, the Spanish school occasionally reverted to the same  style of treatment. A pair of notable pictures are the Madonna of  Bethlehem, by Alonzo Cano, and the Madonna of the Napkin, by Murillo.  Both are in Seville, the latter in the museum, the former still  hanging in its original place in the cathedral.    Of Cano's work, a great authority[1] on Spanish art has written, that,  \"in serene, celestial beauty, it is excelled by no image of the  blessed Mary ever devised in Spain.\" Murillo's picture is better  known, and has a curious interest from its history. The cook in the  Capuchin monastery, where the artist had been painting, begged a  picture as a parting gift. No canvas being at hand, a napkin was  offered instead, on which the master painted a Madonna, unexcelled  among his works in brilliancy of color.    [Footnote 1: Stirling-Maxwell, in \"Annals of the Artists of Spain.\"]    [Illustration: GABRIEL MAX.--MADONNA AND CHILD.]    As the portrait picture was the first style of Madonna known to art,  so, also, it is the last. By a leap of nearly a thousand years, we  have returned, in our own day, to the method of the tenth century. It  is strange that what was once a matter of necessity should at last  become an object of choice. In the beginning of Madonna art, the  limited resources of technique precluded any attempts to make a more  elaborate setting. Such difficulties no longer stand in the way, and  where we now see a portrait Madonna, the artist has deliberately  discarded all accessories in order better to idealize his theme.    Take, for instance, the portrait Madonnas by Gabriel Max. Here are no  details to divert the attention from motherhood, pure and simple. We  do not ask of the subject whether she is of high or of low estate, a  queen or a peasant. We have only to look into the earnest, loving face  to read that here is a mother. There are two pictures of this sort,  evidently studied from the same Bohemian models. In one, the mother  looks down at her babe; in the other, directly at the spectator, with  a singularly visionary expression. When weary with the senseless  repetition of the set compositions of past ages, we turn with relief  to a simple portrait mother like this, at once the most primitive and  the most advanced form of Madonna art. It is only another case where  the simplest is the best.          CHAPTER II.    THE MADONNA ENTHRONED.      In every true home the mother is queen, enthroned in the hearts of her  loving children. There is, therefore, a beautiful double significance,  which we should always have in mind, in looking at the Madonna  enthroned. According to the theological conception of the period in  which it was first produced, the picture stands for the Virgin Mother  as Queen of Heaven."]]]
