Beyond the said ridge, at  a place whence you could see the higher hills to the south, that  stretched mainly east and west also, there was presently an end of the  Kingdom of Upmeads, though the neighbours on that side were peaceable  and friendly, and were wont to send gifts to King Peter.  But toward  the north beyond the Want-way King Peter was lord over a good stretch  of land, and that of the best; yet was he never a rich man, for he had  no freedom to tax and tail his folk, nor forsooth would he have used it  if he had; for he was no ill man, but kindly and of measure.  On these  northern marches there was war at whiles, whereas they ended in a great  forest well furnished of trees; and this wood was debateable, and King  Peter and his sons rode therein at their peril: but great plenty was  therein of all wild deer, as hart, and buck, and roe, and swine, and  bears and wolves withal.  The lord on the other side thereof was a  mightier man than King Peter, albeit he was a bishop, and a baron of  Holy Church.  To say sooth he was a close-fist and a manslayer; though  he did his manslaying through his vicars, the knights and men-at-arms  who held their manors of him, or whom he waged.    In that forest had King Peter's father died in battle, and his eldest  son also; therefore, being a man of peace, he rode therein but seldom,  though his sons, the three eldest of them, had both ridden therein and  ran therefrom valiantly.  As for Ralph the youngest, his father would  not have him ride the Wood Debateable as yet.    So came those young men to the Want-ways, and found their father  sitting there on a heap of stones, and over against him eight horses,  four destriers, and four hackneys, and four squires withal.  So they  came and stood before their father, waiting for his word, and wondering  what it would be.    Now spake King Peter:  \"Fair sons, ye would go on all adventure to seek  a wider land, and a more stirring life than ye may get of me at home:  so be it!  But I have bethought me, that, since I am growing old and  past the age of getting children, one of you, my sons, must abide at  home to cherish me and your mother, and to lead our carles in war if  trouble falleth upon us.  Now I know not how to choose by mine own wit  which of you shall ride and which abide.  For so it is that ye are  diverse of your conditions; but the evil conditions which one of you  lacks the other hath, and the valiancy which one hath, the other lacks.  Blaise is wise and prudent, but no great man of his hands.  Hugh is a  stout rider and lifter, but headstrong and foolhardy, and over  bounteous a skinker; and Gregory is courteous and many worded, but  sluggish in deed; though I will not call him a dastard.  As for Ralph,  he is fair to look on, and peradventure he may be as wise as Blaise, as  valiant as Hugh, and as smooth-tongued as Gregory; but of all this we  know little or nothing, whereas he is but young and untried.  Yet may  he do better than you others, and I deem that he will do so.  All  things considered, then, I say, I know not how to choose between you,  my sons; so let luck choose for me, and ye shall draw cuts for your  roads; and he that draweth longest shall go north, and the next longest  shall go east, and the third straw shall send the drawer west; but as  to him who draweth the shortest cut, he shall go no whither but back  again to my house, there to abide with me the chances and changes of  life; and it is most like that this one shall sit in my chair when I am  gone, and be called King of Upmeads.    \"Now, my sons, doth this ordinance please you?  For if so be it doth  not, then may ye all abide at home, and eat of my meat, and drink of my  cup, but little chided either for sloth or misdoing, even as it hath  been aforetime.\"    The young men looked at one another, and Blaise answered and said:  \"Sir, as for me I say we will do after your commandment, to take what  road luck may show us, or to turn back home again.\" They all yeasaid  this one after the other; and then King Peter said: \"Now before I draw  the cuts, I shall tell you that I have appointed the squires to go with  each one of you.  Richard the Red shall go with Blaise; for though he  be somewhat stricken in years, and wise, yet is he a fierce carle and a  doughty, and knoweth well all feats of arms.    \"Lancelot Longtongue shall be squire to Hugh; for he is good of seeming  and can compass all courtesy, and knoweth logic (though it be of the  law and not of the schools), yet is he a proper man of his hands; as  needs must he be who followeth Hugh; for where is Hugh, there is  trouble and debate.    \"Clement the Black shall serve Gregory:  for he is a careful carle, and  speaketh one word to every ten deeds that he doeth; whether they be  done with point and edge, or with the hammer in the smithy.    \"Lastly, I have none left to follow thee, Ralph, save Nicholas  Longshanks; but though he hath more words than I have, yet hath he more  wisdom, and is a man lettered and far-travelled, and loveth our house  right well.    \"How say ye, sons, is this to your liking?\"    They all said \"yea.\"  Then quoth the king; \"Nicholas, bring hither the  straws ready dight, and I will give them my sons to draw.\"    So each young man came up in turn and drew; and King Peter laid the  straws together and looked at them, and said:    \"Thus it is, Hugh goeth north with Lancelot, Gregory westward with  Clement.\" He stayed a moment and then said:  \"Blaise fareth eastward  and Richard with him.  As for thee, Ralph my dear son, thou shalt back  with me and abide in my house and I shall see thee day by day; and thou  shalt help me to live my last years happily in all honour; and thy love  shall be my hope, and thy valiancy my stay.\"    Therewith he arose and threw his arm about the young man's neck; but he  shrank away a little from his father, and his face grew troubled; and  King Peter noted that, and his countenance fell, and he said:    \"Nay nay, my son; grudge not thy brethren the chances of the road, and  the ill-hap of the battle.  Here at least for thee is the bounteous  board and the full cup, and the love of kindred and well-willers, and  the fellowship of the folk.  O well is thee, my son, and happy shalt  thou be!\"    But the young man knit his brows and said no word in answer.    Then came forward those three brethren who were to fare at all  adventure, and they stood before the old man saying nought.  Then he  laughed and said: \"O ho, my sons!  Here in Upmeads have ye all ye need  without money, but when ye fare in the outlands ye need money; is it  not a lack of yours that your pouches be bare?  Abide, for I have seen  to it.\"    Therewith he drew out of his pouch three little bags, and said; \"Take  ye each one of these; for therein is all that my treasury may shed as  now.  In each of these is there coined money, both white and red, and  some deal of gold uncoined, and of rings and brooches a few, and by  estimation there is in each bag the same value reckoned in lawful  silver of Upmeads and the Wolds and the Overhill-Countries. Take up  each what there is, and do the best ye may therewith.\"    Then each took his bag, and kissed and embraced his father; and they  kissed Ralph and each other, and so got to horse and departed with  their squires, going softly because of the hot sun.  But Nicholas  slowly mounted his hackney and led Ralph's war-horse with him home  again to King Peter's House.        CHAPTER 2    Ralph Goeth Back Home to the High House      Ralph and King Peter walked slowly home together, and as they went King  Peter fell to telling of how in his young days he rode in the Wood  Debateable, and was belated there all alone, and happed upon men who  were outlaws and wolfheads, and feared for his life; but they treated  him kindly, and honoured him, and saw him safe on his way in the  morning.  So that never thereafter would he be art and part with those  who hunted outlaws to slay them.  \"For,\" said he, \"it is with these men  as with others, that they make prey of folk; yet these for the more  part prey on the rich, and the lawful prey on the poor.  Otherwise it  is with these wolfheads as with lords and knights and franklins, that  as there be bad amongst them, so also there be good; and the good ones  I happed on, and so may another man.\"    Hereto paid Ralph little heed at that time, since he had heard the tale  and its morality before, and that more than once; and moreover his mind  was set upon his own matters and these was he pondering.  Albeit  perchance the words abode with him.  So came they to the House, and  Ralph's mother, who was a noble dame, and well-liking as for her years,  which were but little over fifty, stood in the hall-door to see which  of her sons should come back to her, and when she saw them coming  together, she went up to them, and cast her arms about Ralph and kissed  him and caressed him--being exceeding glad that it was he and not one  of the others who had returned to dwell with them; for he was her  best-beloved, as was little marvel, seeing that he was by far the  fairest and the most loving.  But Ralph's face grew troubled again in  his mother's arms, for he loved her exceeding well; and forsooth he  loved the whole house and all that dwelt there, down to the turnspit  dogs in the chimney ingle, and the swallows that nested in the earthen  bottles, which when he was little he had seen his mother put up in the  eaves of the out-bowers: but now, love or no love, the spur was in his  side, and he must needs hasten as fate would have him.  However, when  he had disentangled himself from his mother's caresses, he enforced  himself to keep a cheerful countenance, and upheld it the whole evening"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16921"],[0,"Plague Ship (#2)"],[1,"er, Dane knew. To the rank conscious Salariki  clansmen you did not yield precedence unless you wanted at once to  acknowledge your inferiority--and if you did that by some slip of  admission or omission, there was no use in trying to treat face to face  with their chieftains again.    \"Houuu--!\" The blast behind was a scream as the retinue it announced  swept around the bend in the road to catch sight of the two Traders  oblivious of it. Dane longed to be able to turn his head, just enough to  see which one of the local lordlings they blocked.    \"Houu--\" there was a questioning note in the cry now and the heavy  thud-thud of feet was slacking. The clan party had seen them, were  hesitant about the wisdom of trying to shove them aside.    Van Rycke marched steadily onward and Dane matched his pace. They might  not possess a leather-lunged herald to clear their road, but they gave  every indication of having the right to occupy as much of it as they  wished. And that unruffled poise had its affect upon those behind. The  pound of feet slowed to a walk, a walk which would keep a careful  distance behind the two Terrans. It had worked--the Salariki--or these  Salariki--were accepting them at their own valuation--a good omen for the  day's business. Dane's spirits rose, but he schooled his features into a  mask as wooden as his superior's. After all this was a very minor victory  and they had ten or twelve hours of polite, and hidden, maneuvering  before them.    The Solar Queen had set down as closely as possible to the trading center  marked on Traxt Cam's private map and the Terrans now had another five  minutes march, in the middle of the road, ahead of the chieftain who must  be inwardly boiling at their presence, before they came out in the  clearing containing the roofless, circular erection which served the  Salariki of the district as a market place and a common meeting ground  for truce talks and the mending of private clan alliances. Erect on a  pole in the middle, towering well above the nodding fronds of the grass  trees, was the pole bearing the trade shield which promised not only  peace to those under it, but a three day sanctuary to any feuder or  duelist who managed to win to it and lay hands upon its weathered  standard.    They were not the first to arrive, which was also a good thing. Gathered  in small groups about the walls of the council place were the personal  attendants, liege warriors, and younger relatives of at least four or  five clan chieftains. But, Dane noted at once, there was not a single  curtained litter or riding orgel to be seen. None of the feminine part of  the Salariki species had arrived. Nor would they until the final trade  treaty was concluded and established by their fathers, husbands, or sons.    With the assurance of one who was master in his own clan, Van Rycke,  displaying no interest at all in the shifting mass of lower rank  Salariki, marched straight on to the door of the enclosure. Two or three  of the younger warriors got to their feet, their brilliant cloaks  flicking out like spreading wings. But when Van Rycke did not even lift  an eyelid in their direction, they made no move to block his path.    As fighting men, Dane thought, trying to study the specimens before him  with a totally impersonal stare, the Salariki were an impressive lot.  Their average height was close to six feet, their distant feline ancestry  apparent only in small vestiges. A Salarik's nails on both hands and feet  were retractile, his skin was gray, his thick hair, close to the texture  of plushy fur, extended down his backbone and along the outside of his  well muscled arms and legs, and was tawny-yellow, blue-gray or white. To  Terran eyes the broad faces, now all turned in their direction, lacked  readable expression. The eyes were large and set slightly aslant in the  skull, being startlingly orange-red or a brilliant turquoise green-blue.  They wore loin cloths of brightly dyed fabrics with wide sashes forming  corselets about their slender middles, from which gleamed the gem-set  hilts of their claw knives, the possession of which proved their  adulthood. Cloaks as flamboyant as their other garments hung in bat wing  folds from their shoulders and each and every one moved in an invisible  cloud of perfume.    Brilliant as the assemblage of liege men without had been, the gathering  of clan leaders and their upper officers within the council place was a  riot of color--and odor. The chieftains were installed on the wooden  stools, each with a small table before him on which rested a goblet  bearing his own clan sign, a folded strip of patterned cloth--his \"trade  shield\"--and a gemmed box containing the scented paste he would use for  refreshment during the ordeal of conference.    A breeze fluttered sash ends and tugged at cloaks, otherwise the assembly  was motionless and awesomely quiet. Still making no overtures Van Rycke  crossed to a stool and table which stood a little apart and seated  himself. Dane went into the action required of him. Before his superior  he set out a plastic pocket flask, its color as alive in the sunlight as  the crudely cut gems which the Salariki sported, a fine silk  handkerchief, and, last of all, a bottle of Terran smelling salts  provided by Medic Tau as a necessary restorative after some hours  combination of Salariki oratory and Salariki perfumes. Having thus done  the duty of liege man, Dane was at liberty to seat himself, cross-legged  on the ground behind his chief, as the other sons, heirs, and advisors  had gathered behind their lords.    The chieftain whose arrival they had in a manner delayed came in after  them and Dane saw that it was Fashdor--another piece of luck--since that  clan was a small one and the chieftain had little influence. Had they so  slowed Halfer or Paft it might be a different matter altogether.    Fashdor was established at his seat, his belongings spread out, and Dane,  counting unobtrusively, was certain that the council was now complete.  Seven clans Traxt Cam had recorded divided the sea coast territory and  there were seven chieftains here--indicative of the importance of this  meeting since some of these clans beyond the radius of the shield peace,  must be fighting a vicious blood feud at that very moment. Yes, seven  were here. Yet there still remained a single stool, directly across the  circle from Van Rycke. An empty stool--who was the late comer?    That question was answered almost as it flashed into Dane's mind. But no  Salariki lordling came through the door. Dane's self-control kept him in  his place, even after he caught the meaning of the insignia emblazoned  across the newcomer's tunic. Trader--and not only a Trader but a Company  man! But why--and how? The Companies only went after big game--this was a  planet thrown open to Free Traders, the independents of the star lanes.  By law and right no Company man had any place here. Unless--behind a face  Dane strove to keep as impassive as Van's his thoughts raced. Traxt Cam  as a Free Trader had bid for the right to exploit Sargol when its sole  exportable product was deemed to be perfume--a small, unimportant trade  as far as the Companies were concerned. And then the Koros stones had  been found and the importance of Sargol must have boomed as far as the  big boys could see. They probably knew of Traxt Cam's death as soon as  the Patrol report on Limbo had been sent to Headquarters. The Companies  all maintained their private information and espionage services. And,  with Traxt Cam dead without an heir, they had seen their chance and moved  in. Only, Dane's teeth set firmly, they didn't have the ghost of a chance  now. Legally there was only one Trader on Sargol and that was the Solar  Queen, Captain Jellico had his records signed by the Patrol to prove  that. And all this Inter-Solar man would do now was to bow out and try  poaching elsewhere.    But the I-S man appeared to be in no haste to follow that only possible  course. He was seating himself with arrogant dignity on that unoccupied  stool, and a younger man in I-S uniform was putting before him the same  type of equipment Dane had produced for Van Rycke. The Cargo-master of  the Solar Queen showed no surprise, if the Eysies' appearance had been  such to him.    One of the younger warriors in Paft's train got to his feet and brought  his hands together with a clap which echoed across the silent gathering  with the force of an archaic solid projectal shot. A Salarik, wearing the  rich dress of the upper ranks, but also the collar forced upon a captive  taken in combat, came into the enclosure carrying a jug in both hands.  Preceded by Paft's son he made the rounds of the assembly pouring a  purple liquid from his jug into the goblet before each chieftain, a  goblet which Paft's heirs tasted ceremoniously before it was presented to  the visiting clan leader. When they paused before Van Rycke the Salarik  nobleman touched the side of the plasta flask in token. It was recognized  that off world men must be cautious over the sampling of local products  and that when they joined in the Taking of the First Cup of Peace, they  did so symbolically.    Paft raised his cup, his gesture copied by everyone around the circle. In  the harsh tongue of his race he repeated a formula so archaic that few of  the Salariki could now translate the sing-song words. They drank and the  meeting was formally opened.    But it was an elderly Salarik seated to the right of Halfer, a man who  wore no claw knife and whose dusky yellow cloak and sash made a subdued  note amid the splendor of his fellows, who spoke first, using the  click-clack of the Trade Lingo his nation had learned from Cam.    \"Under the white,\" he pointed to the shield aloft, \"we assemble to hear  many things. But now come two tongues to speak where once there was but  one father of a clan. Tell us, outlanders, which of you must we now hark  to"]]]
