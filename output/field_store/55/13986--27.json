[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19300"],[0,"A Traveler's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the BÃ¡b (#2)"],[1,"he was wise and prudent and was wont to have regard to the  requirements of the time, he wrote without fear or care a detailed account  of his observations to Mirza Lutf-'Ali the chamberlain in order that the  latter might submit it to the notice of the late king, while he himself  journeyed to all parts of Persia, and in every town and station summoned  the people from the pulpit-tops in such wise that other learned doctors  decided that he must be mad, accounting it a sure case of bewitchment.    Now when the news of the decisions of the doctors and the outcry and  clamor of the lawyers reached Zanjan, Mulla Muhammad-'Ali the divine, who  was a man of mark possessed of penetrating speech, sent one of those on  whom he could rely to _Sh_iraz to investigate this matter. This person,  having acquainted himself with the details of these occurrences in such  wise as was necessary and proper, returned with some [of the Bab's]  writings. When the divine heard how matters were and had made himself  acquainted with the writings, notwithstanding that he was a man expert in  knowledge and noted for profound research, he went mad and became crazed  as was predestined: he gathered up his books in the lecture-room saying,  \"The season of spring and wine has arrived,\" and uttered this sentence:  \"Search for knowledge after reaching the known is culpable.\" Then from the  summit of the pulpit he summoned and directed all his disciples [to  embrace the doctrine], and wrote to the Bab his own declaration and  confession.    The Bab in His reply signified to him the obligation of congregational  prayer.    Although the doctors of Zanjan arose with heart and soul to exhort and  admonish the people they could effect nothing. Finally they were compelled  to go to Tihran and made their complaint before the late king Muhammad  _Sh_ah, requesting that Mulla Muhammad-'Ali might be summoned to Tihran.  So the royal order went forth that he should appear.    Now when he came to Tihran they brought him before a conclave of the  doctors; but, so they relate, after many controversies and disputations  naught was effected with him in that assembly. The late king therefore  bestowed on him a staff and fifty tumans for his expenses, and gave him  permission to return.    At all events, this news being disseminated through all parts and regions  of Persia, and several proselytes arriving in Fars, the doctors perceived  that the matter had acquired importance, that the power to deal with it  had escaped from their hands, and that imprisonment, beating, tormenting,  and contumely were fruitless. So they signified to the governor of Fars,  Husayn _Kh_an, \"If thou desirest the extinction of this fire, or seekest a  firm stopper for this rent and disruption, an immediate cure and decisive  remedy is to kill the Bab. And the Bab has assembled a great host and  meditates a rising.\"    So Husayn _Kh_an ordered 'Abdu'l-Hamid _Kh_an the high constable to attack  the house of the Bab's maternal uncle at midnight on all sides, and to  bring Him and all His followers handcuffed. But 'Abdu'l-Hamid _Kh_an and  his hosts found no one in the house save the Bab, His maternal uncle, and  Siyyid Kazim of Zanjan; and as it chanced that on that night the sickness  of the plague and the extreme heat of the weather had compelled Husayn  _Kh_an to flee, he released the Bab on condition of His quitting the city.    On the morning after that night the Bab with Siyyid Kazim of Zanjan set  out from _Sh_iraz for Isfahan. Before reaching Isfahan He wrote a letter  to the Mu'tamidu'd-Dawlih, the governor of the province, requesting a  lodging in some suitable place with the sanction of the government. The  governor appointed the mansion of the Imam-Jum'ih. There He abode forty  days; and one day, agreeably to the request of the Imam, He wrote without  reflection a commentary on [the Surih of] V'al-'Asr before the company.(7)  When this news reached the Mu'tamid he sought an interview with Him and  questioned Him concerning the \"Special Mission.\" At that same interview an  answer proving the \"Special Mission\" was written.    The Mu'tamid then gave orders that all the doctors should assemble and  dispute with Him in one conclave, and that the discussion should be  faithfully recorded without alteration by the instrumentality of his  private secretary, in order that it might be sent to Tihran, and that  whatever the royal edict and decree should ordain might be carried out.    The doctors, however, considering this arrangement as a weakening of the  Law, did not agree, but held a conclave and wrote, \"If there be doubt in  the matter there is need of assembly and discussion, but as this person's  disagreement with the most luminous Law is clearer than the sun therefore  the best possible thing is to put in practice the sentence of the Law.\"    The Mu'tamid then desired to hold the assembled conference in his own  presence so that the actual truth might be disclosed and hearts be at  peace, but these learned doctors and honorable scholars, unwilling to  bring the Perspicuous Law into contempt, did not approve discussion and  controversy with a young merchant, with the exception of that most erudite  sage Aqa Muhammad-Mihdi, and that eminent Platonist Mirza Hasan of Nur. So  the conference terminated in questionings on certain points relating to  the science of fundamental dogma, and the elucidation and analysis of the  doctrines of Mulla Sadra. So, as no conclusion was arrived at by the  governor from this conference, the severe sentence and harsh decision of  the learned doctors was not carried out; but, anxious to abate the great  anxiety quickly and prevent a public tumult effectually, he gave currency  to a report that a decree had been issued ordering the Bab to be sent to  Tihran in order that some decisive settlement might be arrived at, or that  some courageous divine might be able to confute [Him].    He accordingly sent Him forth from Isfahan with a company of his own  mounted bodyguard; but when they reached Mur_ch_ih-_Kh_ar he gave secret  orders for His return to Isfahan, where he afforded Him a refuge and  asylum in his own roofed private quarters; and not a soul save the  confidential and trusty dependents of the Mu'tamid knew aught of the Bab.    A period of four months passed in this fashion, and the Mu'tamid passed  away to the mercy of God. Gurgin _Kh_an, the Mu'tamid's nephew, was aware  of the Bab's being in the private apartments, and represented the matter  to the Prime Minister. Haji Mirza Aqasi, that celebrated minister, issued  a decisive command and gave instructions that they should send the Bab  secretly in disguise under the escort of Nusayri horsemen to the capital.    When He reached Kinar-Gird a fresh order came from the Prime Minister  appointing the village of Kulayn as an abode and dwelling-place. There He  remained for a period of twenty days. After that, the Bab forwarded a  letter to the Royal Presence craving audience to set forth the truth of  His condition, expecting this to be a means for the attainment of great  advantages. The Prime Minister did not admit this, and made representation  to the Royal Presence: \"The royal cavalcade is on the point of starting,  and to engage in such matters as the present will conduce to the  disruption of the kingdom. Neither is there any doubt that the most  notable doctors of the capital also will behave after the fashion of the  doctors of Isfahan, which thing will be the cause of a popular outbreak,  or that, according to the religion of the immaculate Imam, they will  regard the blood of this siyyid as of no account, yea, as more lawful than  mother's milk. The imperial train is prepared for travel, neither is there  hindrance or impediment in view. There is no doubt that the presence of  the Bab will be the cause of the gravest trouble and the greatest  mischief. Therefore, on the spur of the moment, the wisest plan is this:  to place this person in the Castle of Maku during the period of absence of  the royal train from the seat of the imperial throne, and to defer the  obtaining of an audience to the time of return.\"    Agreeably to this view a letter was issued addressed to the Bab in his  Majesty's own writing, and, according to the traditional account of the  tenor of this letter, the epitome thereof is this:    (After the titles). \"Since the royal train is on the verge of departure  from Tihran, to meet in a befitting manner is impossible. Do you go to  Maku and there abide and rest for a while, engaged in praying for our  victorious state; and we have arranged that under all circumstances they  shall show you attention and respect. When we return from travel we will  summon you specially.\"    After this they sent Him off with several mounted guards (amongst them  Muhammad Big, the courier) to Tabriz and Maku.    Besides this the followers of the Bab recount certain messages conveyed  [from Him] by the instrumentality of Muhammad Big (amongst which was a  promise to heal the foot of the late king, but on condition of an  interview, and the suppression of the tyranny of the majority), and the  Prime Minister's prevention of the conveyance of these letters to the  Royal Presence. For he himself laid claim to be a spiritual guide and was  prepared to perform the functions of religious directorship. But others  deny these accounts.    At all events in the course of the journey He wrote a letter to the Prime  Minister saying, \"You summoned Me from Isfahan to meet the doctors and for  the attainment of a decisive settlement. What has happened now that this  excellent intention has been changed for Maku and Tabriz?\"    Although He remained forty days in the city of Tabriz the learned doctors  did not condescend to approach Him and did not deem it right to meet Him.  Then they sent Him off to the Castle of Maku, and for nine months lodged  Him in the inaccessible castle which is situated on "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19312"],[0,"Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas (#2)"],[1,"to the Heavenly Kingdom!
