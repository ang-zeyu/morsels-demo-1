The animal may appear  conventionalized to a greater or less extent and the head in turn may  change in the same way until only a single characteristic of the animal  remains by which to identify it as, for example, the spots of the jaguar  or the feathering around the eye of the macaw. In the case of the  glyphs, a term employed to designate the regular and usually square  characters appearing in lines or columns throughout the codices and  inscriptions, we find both the realistic drawing and that where  conventionalism has come in.    THE TONALAMATL. The Maya codices are made up, for the most part, of the  records of the sacred period of two hundred and sixty days, a period  called in Nahuatl, _tonalamatl_, and other numerical calculations. The  _tonalamatl_ was used for purposes of divination in order to find out  whether good or bad fortune was in store for an individual. It is not  necessary at this place to go into the different means taken to record  this period of time or its methods of use. It may be well, however, to  explain the usual distribution of the pictures in the codices, including  those of animals, in connection with the representation of the  _tonalamatl_. A normal period is shown in Dresden 6c-7c. A column of  five day signs occurs in the middle of 6c with a single red dot over it.  To the right of this column stretches a horizontal line of numbers  consisting of alternate groups of black and red lines and dots. Under  each pair of red and black numbers there is usually a human form and  over each pair a group of four glyphs belonging to the figure below.  Schellhas (1904) has classified the various figures of gods appearing in  these vignettes of the _tonalamatl_ and lettered them. References  throughout the paper will be made to the gods by letters and the reader  is referred to Schellhas' paper. Animal figures often take the place of  these gods as in the second picture in Dresden 7c where the screech owl  is shown with human body. The greater number of animal figures in the  codices occur in some connection with these _tonalamatls_.    MYTHOLOGICAL ANIMALS. Where figures are shown with human body and animal  head standing alone in the place usually occupied by one of the various  deities in the _tonalamatl_, there can be little doubt that they have a  mythological meaning and are to be taken, either as gods themselves, or  as representing certain of the gods. All of the animals are by no means  shown in this position. The screech owl, or Moan bird (as in Dresden  10a) appears most frequently in this way. The king vulture (Dresden 8a),  the dog (Dresden 7a), and the parrot (Dresden 40b) come next in  descending importance. The animals represented as copulating (as in  Dresden 13c) might also be considered as mythological animals as well as  the full drawings of the jaguar (Dresden 8a) and the other animals when  they occur alone in the regular vignette of the _tonalamatl_. The four  priests in Dresden 25a-28a should also be regarded as representing, in  all probability, the dog as a mythological animal. The idea of  worshipping animals as gods in themselves is strengthened by noting the  ease with which the Maya people worshipped the horse which was left  behind by Cortes in his march from Mexico across to Honduras  (Villagutierre, 1701, pp. 100-101).    ASTRONOMICAL IDEAS. Animals frequently have a part to play in relation  to the constellations. Throughout the codices and, to a less degree, in  the stone carvings, we find what have usually been considered to be  glyphs for several of the constellations. Numerous calculations in the  codices make it clear that the Mayas had a good knowledge of astronomy.  These glyphs are usually oblong in shape and three or more are arranged  together end to end. We have called these the constellation bands.  Various attempts have been made to identify these signs of the various  constellations. Animals frequently are pictured below these bands. The  dog with fire brands in his paws and often attached to his tail is shown  in several places coming head downward from one of these bands (as in  Dresden 36a). The peccary is also shown in the same position although  the fire brands do not appear (Dresden 68a). A figure with macaw head  occurs once standing beneath one of these bands with fire brands in his  hands (Dresden 40b). The serpent (as in Dresden 36a), the  lizard-crocodile-like animal in Dresden 74, the turtle (Tro-Cortesianus  71a), the vulture (Dresden 38b), the turkey (Tro-Cortesianus 10b), and  the deer (Tro-Cortesianus 47a) all appear in connection with these  constellation bands. It is impossible at this time to decide upon the  part these various animals play in relation to distinct constellations.  In addition to the animals named, several of the gods, especially god B,  are found below these bands. One of these signs, the one identified by  Foerstemann as standing for Saturn, is composed of the head of the  crocodile more or less conventionalized.    Foerstemann (1902, p. 27) identifies the turtle with the summer solstice  and the snail as the animal associated with the winter solstice. There  does not seem to be any one animal used in connection with any one of  the cardinal points. In Tro-Cortesianus 88c the dog seems to be  associated with the north as shown by the glyph which is ordinarily  regarded as connected with that direction, the ape with the west, and an  unidentifiable bird sitting on a _Cimi_ (death) sign with the south. The  east is connected in this place with a human figure. It should be  stated, however, that it is not absolutely certain that the usual  assignment of the cardinal points, each to its special direction, is  correct. The signs for the east and west as well as those for the north  and south may be reversed. With the exception of the assignment of the  offering-glyphs to the various cardinal points which will be discussed  later (p. 290) this is almost the only case where a clear relation can  be made out between the various animals and the signs for the four  directions. There is no definite relation as is seen, for example, in  the Vaticanus 3773, 17, 18 where the quetzal is noted perched on the  tree of the east, the eagle on that of the north, the humming bird on  that of the west, and the jaguar on the tree of the south.    COPULATION. The conception, the period of pregnancy, the infant baptism,  and possibly, the naming of children are shown in both the  Tro-Cortesianus (91-95) and the Dresden (13-23). Animals are frequently  shown copulating with various gods or with one another. In Dresden 13c,  the deer and god M and the vulture and the dog; in 19c, the vulture and  a woman; in Tro-Cortesianus 91d, a god and a woman; and in 92d, an  armadillo and a deer both with female figures. These animals probably  represent in some way the totems of the man or woman in question and are  shown in place of the human figure. The Lacandones, a Maya people, show  at the present time the remains of a totemic system (Tozzer, 1907, pp.  40-42). The deer (_Ke_) gens is found at the present time. In the  greater number of cases where copulation is shown a god and a female  figure are pictured. The presentation of the new-born children by women  with bird head-dresses, also occurring in this same section of both  manuscripts, is discussed later (p. 291).    ANIMAL SACRIFICES. Various ceremonials occurring at intervals throughout  the Maya year which included sacrifices to the gods, evidently took up a  large part of the time of the people. Animals composed by far the major  part of the gifts made to the gods. This was especially true in regard  to the ceremonies occurring at the beginning of each year. According to  the Maya calendar there were four days only which could come at the  beginning of the year and these came in succession. Landa (1864, pp.  210-233), the first Bishop of Yucatan, gives a minute description of the  rites of the four years which were named according to the initial day.  He also relates the manner in which the various animals are employed as  offerings in these rites and also in others taking place at the  beginning of the various months.[289-*]    The rites which took place at the beginning and the end of the year are  shown in Dresden 25-28 and in Tro-Cortesianus 34-37. The dog, the deer,  and the turkey are the most important of the animals shown as being  offered to the gods in this connection. It will not be necessary to  consider these animals in detail at this place as they are each taken up  later.    OFFERINGS SHOWN BY GLYPHS. It is, however, in another connection than  that just considered that the animals are shown as offerings far more  frequently throughout the Maya manuscripts. In the ceremonies of the  four years, the animals and birds are, for the most part, represented  entire and purely as pictures. Offerings are also shown in the form of  glyphs. These may occur in connection with the figures of the gods or in  the lines of hieroglyphs above the pictures. When they are used in the  former relation they are usually shown as resting in a bowl or dish  (Dresden 35a). It frequently happens that when a god is making an  offering represented by the entire animal or a glyph of the animal in  the main picture, there is a corresponding glyph of the offering above  in the line of hieroglyphics (Dresden 23b).    The fish, iguana, turkey, deer and possibly the lizard are the usual  animals shown as glyphs in this connection. The frigate bird occurs once  in the Dresden (35a) and once in the Tro-Cortesianus (34a) as an  offering. The dog, curiously enough, does not seem to be represented by  an offering-glyph although he has a glyph of his own when appearing in  other connections. The iguana and fish are shown entire although drawn  very small; the head is the only part usually shown of the turkey and  the haunch "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19053"],[0,"Theory of Circulation (#2)"],[1,"s. Let  the whole be made nearly full of water; then, under the tin vessel  (representing the lungs), let a fire be made. As the water heats, it  will expand; and as the valve closes to the right, it will go off to the  left side of the vessel. But, as no water will come in from the right,  on account of the valves, there will be no current. Now let the hand  grasp the india-rubber, and the fluid between the valves being displaced  by its pressure, all the water will go towards the tin vessel, because,  while the valve representing the tricuspid would close, that  representing the semi-lunar (between the mimic heart and lungs) would  open--and very freely; because the expansion made by the heat under the  tin vessel had created a vacuum, and thus made a suction power to draw  it forward, while there is a driving power behind to force it onward  into the tin vessel. Then relaxing the hand, a vacuum will exist between  the two valves; and the valve in the rear of the current now begun (the  tricuspid) would open, and the water rush in to fill the vacuum in the  india-rubber ventricle, to be again pressed forward by the next grasp of  the hand; and thus--the fire (representing respiration) being kept up,  and the alternate grasping and relaxing of the hand (representing the  heart's regular impulse)--a perpetual circulation might be made to go  on;[1] but not without another condition of the problem.    And it was in performing this experiment that a truth was discovered,  which, had it been known, many who have ignorantly lost their lives  might have preserved them. When the fluid in the apparatus became  equally, or nearly as much, heated at the extreme parts of the  circulating tube as at the heating vessel, then the motive power of  expansion ceased, and (the hand's impulse being too weak of itself to  carry it on) circulation failed; but it was restored by putting snow or  ice around the extreme parts of the tube. How often have we heard of  ladies who, having gone into warm baths, have been found dead by their  friends, or too nearly so, to be restored.[2] Through ignorance of the  cause, no right means would be taken to restore them, such as dashing  cold water upon the exterior, with simultaneous efforts to produce, in  fresh air and in proper position, such artificial respiration as leads  to the natural. Where no internal lesions have occurred, there is every  reason to believe that such measures might produce restoration.    My imperfect machines gave me to see how much might be done for this  important part of physiology by a more perfect apparatus. Mine was  merely horizontal--but one might be made to take as many positions as  are natural to the human frame; and how many facts might such an one  elicit concerning the effects of position on the circulation, by which  lives might every day be saved! But skilful mechanicians, not ordinary  mechanics, are needed, who are men of intellectual capacity, and are  furnished with _carte-blanche_ for time and expense.[3]    The years 1836-'7-'8 witnessed, on my part, several extraordinary and  fruitless efforts to get before the public the theory, of whose truth  and importance I was then fully convinced. In 1839, Dr. C. Smith, then  of Troy, an able medical lecturer, became a convert to the theory; and  showed me, in post mortem dissections, the organs of respiration and  circulation. At the close of that year, having carefully corrected and  made out copies of my manuscript theory, which I had before written, I  sent two to Paris--one to the two brothers, Drs. Edwards, members of the  French Institute, and one to my friend, Madame Belloc. I also sent one  to Edinburgh, to Dr. Abercrombie. Dr. Milne Edwards soon after wrote a  book, in which he made it a point to show that animals could live  several minutes without breathing; and Dr. Frederic Edwards wrote me a  short letter of objections to my theory, and adherence to that of  Harvey. This letter was copied and answered in my work published in  1846.    About this time, Dr. Aikin, of Baltimore, wrote to me on the subject;  and showed, by calculations, that the mere gradual expansion of the  water of the blood was not sufficient, of itself, to produce a current  as rapid as that of the blood was proved to be, even on the lowest  estimate of its velocity. This did not shake my faith in the great fact  that circulation was created by respiration. It must be so; for in life,  such respiration as produces heat is the invariable antecedent of  circulation, and nothing else is. There was something, then, which  remained to be discovered. Again, I placed before me the conditions of  the great problem, and set myself intently to its study; and I soon  found what I thus sought, and then discerned for the first time that the  blood moves, as does the railroad car, by steam. John Bell, my favorite  author, had shown that the lungs work _in vacuo_. A great proportion of  the blood is water, which, in a vacuum, springs into vapor at 67 deg., and  the temperature of the blood in the lungs is 101 deg.. Its expansion, then,  was not merely the gradual increase of bulk by transmitted heat, but  also that of instantaneous expansion, by the vaporization of so much of  it as is needed; and what expanded water could not do, steam certainly  could. At once, a throng of proofs came to my mind. The most apparent of  these was the vapor _expired_ breathing. I recollected how, in former  times, the stage horses, driven rapidly into my native village of a  winter morning, had clouds of vapor wreathing upward from their  nostrils, while the icicles of condensation were hanging below. The  nurse, who stands over the dying, holds a mirror before the mouth and  nose, and considers that life is only extinct when vapor ceases to be  formed. Then came to mind the solution of that great mystery of  physiology, why the arteries are empty at death, which so long hindered  the discovery finally made by Harvey.    In the state in which chemistry was, even as late as the time of John  Bell, the chemical power of the heat produced by respiration at the  lungs could not have been understood.      SECTION II.    Publication of the Theory, in 1846, in \"A treatise on the Motive Powers      which produce the Circulation of the Blood.\" Its Reception: Critique      in the New York \"Journal of Medicine,\" September, 1846. My Reply, in      the same Journal, March, 1847.    TO DR. MARCY.--In the years immediately succeeding 1840, (in which year,  as you will recollect, I had the honor to receive your countenance and  advice respecting my theory,) I was almost exclusively devoted to the  revision and enlargement of my historical works; but early is 1846,  having determined on making the tour of the United States, I resolved  first to prepare my theory for the press. In the introduction, I  remarked, \"The house of clay in which the mind dwells must receive a  portion of its care; and that which I have bestowed on mine has  proceeded on a belief in the truth of the theory herein advocated, as  undoubting as that in the laws of gravitation; and when any new fact, or  any remark of an author, relating to my theory came under my  observation, I noted it down and laid it by with its kindred. About to  set out on a long journey, and aware that my field of vision had thus  enlarged, I felt it my duty to put together the principal of my remarks,  that I might so leave the subject, that, in case anything should prevent  my return, it would be in a form equal to the present slate in which the  theory exists in my own mind.\"    The time I had spent in devotion to this theory, the many rebuffs I had  met in seeking to promulgate it--sometimes, unhappily, affecting my  social life--had made painful the duty of publishing it. My historical  works had been received with favor; but I believed that, in publishing  this, it would be charged against me that I chose a subject unsuited to  my sex. I therefore said, in my preface, \"This is not so much a subject  which I chose, as one which chooses me; and if the Father of Lights has  been pleased to reveal to me from the book of his physical truth a  sentence before unread, is it for me to suppose that it is for my  individual benefit? or is it for you, my reader, to turn away your ear  from hearing this truth, and charge its great Author with having  ill-chosen his instrument to communicate it?\"    As I passed southward on my journey, I left, March, 1846, my  manuscript in the hands of Wiley & Putnam, in N. York:[4] to be  published at my expense. During the six months in which I was absent  on my travels, my book was published; and the publishers sent copies,  as directed by me, to many of my personal friends, and to several  physicians. They sent other copies, which procured notices, some of  which were favorable, particularly one from the _London Critic_, and  others, the reverse. As few copies of the book sold, I was not  remunerated for the cost of publication. The copies sent to physicians  were mostly unacknowledged--received in cold, if not contemptuous,  silence. But my family physician, the worthy and learned Dr. Robbins,  to whom I dedicated the work, ever upheld me. He answered my questions,  gave me instructions, and showed me post-mortem dissections; and to  those who asked him if he believed in my theory, he wisely replied,  \"Mrs. Willard is right as far as she goes.\" He knew that I made no  pretensions to understand the vast variety of medical subjects not  connected with the circulation, and that I never doubted his skill or  disputed his prescriptions. An honest man, and a skilful physician, he  deserved and had my unfailing confidence. And if, by reason of what I  knew, I had prolonged my life, he had the longer kept a good and  faithful patient. Lady-friends, to whom I had sent my work, had  sometimes referred it to their medical advisers; and thus Dr. Hiester,  an eminent physician of Reading, Pa., became a"]]]
