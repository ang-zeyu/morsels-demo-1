All vegetable fibres are easily tendered, or rendered rotten,  by the action of even dilute mineral acids; with the additional action  of steam, the effect is much more rapid, as also if the fibre is allowed  to dry with the acid upon or in it. Animal fibres are not nearly so  sensitive under these conditions. But whereas caustic alkalis have not  much effect on vegetable fibres, if kept out of contact with the air,  the animal fibres are very quickly attacked. Superheated steam alone has  but little effect on cotton or vegetable fibres, but it would fuse or  melt wool. Based on these differences, methods have been devised and  patented for treating mixed woollen and cotton tissues--(1) with  hydrochloric acid gas, or moistening with dilute hydrochloric acid and  steaming, to remove all the cotton fibre; or (2) with a jet of  superheated steam, under a pressure of 5 atmospheres (75 lb. per square  inch), when the woollen fibre is simply melted out of the tissue, and  sinks to the bottom of the vessel, a vegetable tissue remaining  (Heddebault). If we write on paper with dilute sulphuric acid, and dry  and then heat the place written upon, the cellulose is destroyed and  charred, and we get black writing produced. The principle involved is  the same as in the separation of cotton from mixed woollen and cotton  goods by means of sulphuric acid or vitriol. The fabric containing  cotton, or let us say cellulose particles, is treated with dilute  vitriol, pressed or squeezed, and then roughly dried. That cellulose  then becomes mere dust, and is simply beaten out of the intact woollen  texture. The cellulose is, in a pure state, a white powder, of specific  gravity 1.5, _i.e._ one and a half times as heavy as water, and is quite  insoluble in such solvents as water, alcohol, ether; but it does  dissolve in a solution of hydrated oxide of copper in ammonia. On adding  acids to the cupric-ammonium solution, the cellulose is reprecipitated  in the form of a gelatinous mass. Cotton and linen are scarcely  dissolved at all by a solution of basic zinc chloride.    [Footnote 1: _J.S.C.I. = Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry._]    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    _Silk._--We now pass on to the animal fibres, and of these we must first  consider silk. This is one of the most perfect substances for use in the  textile arts. A silk fibre may be considered as a kind of rod of  solidified flexible gum, secreted in and exuded from glands placed on  the side of the body of the silk-worm. In Fig. 4 are shown the forms of  the silk fibre, in which there are no central cavities or axial bores as  in cotton and flax, and no signs of any cellular structure or external  markings, but a comparatively smooth, glassy surface. There is, however,  a longitudinal groove of more or less depth. The fibre is  semi-transparent, the beautiful pearly lustre being due to the  smoothness of the outer layer and its reflection of the light. In the  silk fibre there are two distinct parts: first, the central portion, or,  as we may regard it, the true fibre, chemically termed _fibroin_; and  secondly, an envelope composed of a substance or substances, chemically  termed _sericin_, and often \"silk-glue\" or \"silk-gum.\" Both the latter  and _fibroin_ are composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.  Here there is thus one element more than in the vegetable fibres  previously referred to, namely, nitrogen; and this nitrogen is contained  in all the animal fibres. The outer envelope of silk-glue or sericin can  be dissolved off the inner fibroin fibre by means of hot water, or warm  water with a little soap. Warm dilute (that is, weak) acids, such as  sulphuric acid, etc., also dissolve this silk-glue, and can be used like  soap solutions for ungumming silk. Dilute nitric acid only slightly  attacks silk, and colours it yellow; it would not so colour vegetable  fibres, and this forms a good test to distinguish silk from a vegetable  fibre. Cold strong acetic acid, so-called glacial acetic acid, removes  the yellowish colouring matter from raw silk without dissolving the  sericin or silk-gum. By heating under pressure with acetic acid,  however, silk is completely dissolved. Silk is also dissolved by strong  sulphuric acid, forming a brown thick liquid. If we add water to this  thick liquid, a clear solution is obtained, and then on adding tannic  acid the fibroin is precipitated. Strong caustic potash or soda  dissolves silk; more easily if warm. Dilute caustic alkalis, if  sufficiently dilute, will dissolve off the sericin and leave the inner  fibre of fibroin; but they are not so good for ungumming silk as soap  solutions are, as the fibre after treatment with them is deficient in  whiteness and brilliancy. Silk dissolves completely in hot basic zinc  chloride solution, and also in an alkaline solution of copper and  glycerin, which solutions do not dissolve vegetable fibres or wool.  Chlorine and bleaching-powder solutions soon attack and destroy silk,  and so another and milder agent, namely, sulphurous acid, is used to  bleach this fibre. Silk is easily dyed by the aniline and coal-tar  colours, and with beautiful effect, but it has little attraction for the  mineral colours.    _Wool_.--Next to silk as an animal fibre we come to wool and different  varieties of fur and hair covering certain classes of animals, such as  sheep, goats, rabbits, and hares. Generally, and without going at all  deeply into the subject, we may say that wool differs from fur and hair,  of which we may regard it as a variety, by being usually more elastic,  flexible, and curly, and because it possesses certain features of  surface structure which confer upon it the property of being more easily  matted together than fur and hair are. We must first shortly consider  the manner of growth of hair without spending too much time on this part  of the subject. The accompanying figure (see Fig. 5) shows a section of  the skin with a hair or wool fibre rooted in it. Here we may see that  the ground work, if we may so term it, is four-fold in structure.  Proceeding downwards, we have--(first) the outer skin, scarf-skin or  cuticle; (second) a second layer or skin called the _rete mucosum_,  forming the epidermis; (third) papillary layer; (fourth) the corium  layer, forming the dermis. The peculiar, globular, cellular masses below  in the corium are called adipose cells, and these throw off perspiration  or moisture, which is carried away to the surface by the glands shown  (called sudoriparous glands), which, as is seen, pass independently off  to the surface. Other glands terminate under the skin in the hair  follicles, which follicles or hair sockets contain or enclose the hair  roots. These glands terminating in the hair follicles secrete an oily  substance, which bathes and lubricates as well as nourishes the hair.  With respect to the origin of the hair or wool fibre, this is formed  inside the follicle by the exuding therefrom of a plastic liquid or  lymph; this latter gradually becomes granular, and is then formed into  cells, which, as the growth proceeds, are elongated into fibres, which  form the central portion of the hair. Just as with the trunk of a tree,  we have an outer dense portion, the bark, an inner less dense and more  cellular layer, and an inmost portion which is most cellular and  porous; so with a hair, the central portion is loose and porous, the  outer more and more dense. On glancing at the figure (Fig. 6) of the  longitudinal section of a human hair, we see first the outer portion,  like the bark of a tree, consisting of a dense sheath of flattened  scales, then comes an inner lining of closely-packed fibrous cells, and  frequently an inner well-marked central bundle of larger and rounder  cells, forming a medullary axis. The transverse section (Fig. 7) shows  this exceedingly well. The end of a hair is generally pointed, sometimes  filamentous. The lower extremity is larger than the shaft, and  terminates in a conical bulb, or mass of cells, which forms the root of  the hair. In the next figure (Fig. 8) we are supposed to have separated  these cells, and above, (a), we see some of the cells from the central  pith or medulla, and fat globules; between, (b), some of the  intermediate elongated or angular cells; and below, (c), two flattened,  compressed, structureless, and horny scales from the outer portion of  the hair. Now these latter flattened scales are of great importance.  Their character and mode of connection with the stratum, or cortical  substance, below, not only make all the difference between wool and  hair, but also determine the extent and degree of that peculiar property  of interlocking of the hairs known as felting. Let us now again look at  a human hair. The light was reflected from this hair as it lay under the  microscope, and now we see the reason of the saw-like edge in the  longitudinal section, for just as the tiles lie on the roof of a house,  or the scales on the back of a fish, so the whole surface of the hair  is externally coated with a firmly adhering layer of flat overlying  scales, with not very even upper edges, as you see. The upper or free  edges of these scales are all directed towards the end of the hair, and  away from the root. But when you look at a hair in its natural state you  cannot see these scales, so flat do they lie on the hair-shaft. What you  see are only irregular transverse lines across it. Now I come to a  matter of great importance, as will later on appear in connection with  means for promoting felting properties. If a hair such as described,  with the scales lying flat on the shaft, be treated with certain  substances or reagents which act upon and dissolve, or decompose or  disintegrate its parts, then the free edges of these scales rise up,  they \"set their backs up,\" so to say. They, in fact,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17742"],[0,"Navajo weavers (#2)"],[1,"this makes a brilliant  tan-color; but applied to wool it produces a much paler tint.    Sec. III. Plate XXXVIII and Fig. 42 illustrate ordinary blanket-looms.  Two posts, _a a_, are set firmly in the ground; to these are lashed  two cross-pieces or braces, _b c_, the whole forming the frame of the  loom. Sometimes two slender trees, growing at a convenient distance  from one another, are made to answer for the posts, _d_ is a  horizontal pole, which I call the supplementary yarn-beam, attached to  the upper brace, _b_, by means of a rope, _e e_, spirally applied. _f_  is the upper beam of the loom. As it is analogous to the yarn-beam of  our looms, I will call it by this name, although once only have I seen  the warp wound around it. It lies parallel to the pole _d_, about 2 or  3 inches below it, and is attached to the latter by a number of loops,  _g g_. A spiral cord wound around the yarn-beam holds the upper border  cord _h h_, which, in turn, secures the upper end of the warp _i i_.  The lower beam of the loom is shown at _k_. I will call this the  cloth-beam, although the finished web is never wound around it; it is  tied firmly to the lower brace, _c_, of the frame, and to it is  secured the lower border cord of the blanket. The original distance  between the two beams is the length of the blanket. Lying between the  threads of the warp is depicted a broad, thin, oaken stick, _l_, which  I will call the batten. A set of healds attached to a heald-rod, _m_,  are shown above the batten. These healds are made of cord or yarn;  they include alternate threads of the warp, and serve when drawn  forward to open the lower shed. The upper shed is kept patent by a  stout rod, _n_ (having no healds attached), which I name the shed-rod.  Their substitute for the reed of our looms is a wooden fork, which  will be designated as the reed-fork (Fig. 44, _a_).    [Illustration: FIG. 42.--Ordinary Navajo blanket loom.]    For convenience of description, I am obliged to use the word  \"shuttle,\" although, strictly speaking, the Navajo has no shuttle. If  the figure to be woven is a long stripe, or one where the weft must be  passed through 6 inches or more of the shed at one time, the yarn is  wound on a slender twig or splinter, or shoved through on the end of  such a piece of wood; but where the pattern is intricate, and the weft  passes at each turn through only a few inches of the shed, the yarn is  wound into small skeins or balls and shoved through with the finger.    Sec. IV. The warp is thus constructed: A frame of four sticks is made,  not unlike the frame of the loom, but lying on or near the ground,  instead of standing erect. The two sticks forming the sides of the  frame are rough saplings or rails; the two forming the top and bottom  are smooth rounded poles--often the poles which afterwards serve as  the beams of the loom; these are placed parallel to one another, their  distance apart depending on the length of the projected blanket.    On these poles the warp is laid in a continuous string. It is first  firmly tied to one of the poles, which I will call No. 1 (Fig. 43);  then it is passed over the other pole, No. 2, brought back under No. 2  and over No. 1, forward again under No. 1 and over No. 2, and so on to  the end. Thus the first, third, fifth, &c., turns of the cord cross in  the middle the second, fourth, sixth, &c., forming a series of  elongated figures 8, as shown in the following diagram--    [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Diagram showing formation of warp.]    and making, in the very beginning of the process, the two sheds, which  are kept distinct throughout the whole work. When sufficient string  has been laid the end is tied to pole No. 2, and a rod is placed in  each shed to keep it open, the rods being afterwards tied together at  the ends to prevent them from falling out.    This done, the weaver takes three strings (which are afterwards  twilled into one, as will appear) and ties them together at one end.  She now sits outside one of the poles, looking towards the centre of  the frame, and proceeds thus: (1) She secures the triple cord to the  pole immediately to the left of the warp; (2) then she takes one of  the threads (or strands as they now become) and passes it under the  first turn of the warp; (3) next she takes a second strand, and  twilling it once or oftener with the other strands, includes with it  the second bend of the warp; (4) this done, she takes the third strand  and, twilling it as before, passes it under the third bend of the  warp, and thus she goes on until the entire warp in one place is  secured between the strands of the cord; (5) then she pulls the string  to its fullest extent, and in doing so separates the threads of the  warp from one another; (6) a similar three stranded cord is applied to  the other end of the warp, along the outside of the other pole.    At this stage of the work these stout cords lie along the outer  surfaces of the poles, parallel with the axes of the latter, but when  the warp is taken off the poles and applied to the beams of the loom  by the spiral thread, as above described, and as depicted in Plate  XXXVIII and Fig. 42, and all is ready for weaving, the cords appear on  the inner sides of the beams, _i.e._, one (Pl. XXXVIII and Fig. 42, _h  h_) at the lower side of the yarn-beam, the other at the upper side of  the cloth-beam, and when the blanket is finished they form the stout  end margins of the web. In the coarser grade of blankets the cords are  removed and the ends of the warp tied in pairs and made to form a  fringe. (See Figs. 54 and 55.)    When the warp is transferred to the loom the rod which was placed in  the upper shed remains there, or another rod, straighter and  smoother, is substituted for it; but with the lower shed, healds are  applied to the anterior threads and the rod is withdrawn.    Sec. V. The mode of applying the healds is simple: (1) the weaver sits  facing the loom in the position for weaving; (2) she lays at the right  (her right) side of the loom a ball of string which she knows contains  more than sufficient material to make the healds; (3) she takes the  end of this string and passes it to the left through the shed, leaving  the ball in its original position; (4) she ties a loop at the end of  the string large enough to admit the heald-rod; (5) she holds  horizontally in her left hand a straightish slender rod, which is to  become the heald-rod--its right extremity touching the left edge of  the warp--and passes the rod through the loop until the point of the  stick is even with the third (second anterior from the left) thread of  the warp; (6) she puts her finger through the space between the first  and third threads and draws out a fold of the heald-string; (7) she  twists this once around, so as to form a loop, and pushes the point of  the heald-rod on to the right through this loop; (8) she puts her  finger into the next space and forms another loop; (9) and so on she  continues to advance her rod and form her loops from left to right  until each of the anterior (alternate) warp-threads of the lower shed  is included in a loop of the heald; (10) when the last loop is made  she ties the string firmly to the rod near its right end.    When the weaving is nearly done and it becomes necessary to remove the  healds, the rod is drawn out of the loops, a slight pull is made at  the thread, the loops fall in an instant, and the straightened string  is drawn out of the shed. Illustrations of the healds may be seen in  Plates XXXV and XXXVIII and Figs. 42, 44, and 46, that in Fig. 46  being the most distinct.    Sec. VI. In making a blanket the operator sits on the ground with her  legs folded under her. The warp hangs vertically before her, and  (excepting in a case to be mentioned) she weaves from below upwards.  As she never rises from this squatting posture when at work, it is  evident that when she has woven the web to a certain height further  work must become inconvenient or impossible unless by some arrangement  the finished web is drawn downwards. Her cloth-beam does not revolve  as in our looms, so she brings her work within easy reach by the  following method: The spiral rope (Plate XXXVIII and Fig. 42) is  loosened, the yarn-beam is lowered to the desired distance, a fold is  made in the loosened web, and the upper edge of the fold is sewed down  tightly to the cloth-beam. In all new blankets over two feet long the  marks of this sewing are to be seen, and they often remain until the  blanket is worn out. Plate XXXV, representing a blanket nearly  finished, illustrates this procedure.    Except in belts, girths, and perhaps occasionally in very narrow  blankets, the shuttle is never passed through the whole width of the  warp at once, but only through a space which does not exceed the  length of the batten; for it is by means of the batten, which is  rarely more than 3 feet long, that the shed is opened.    [Illustration: PL. XXXV.--WEAVING OF DIAMOND-SHAPED DIAGONALS.]    Suppose the woman begins by weaving in the lower shed. She draws  apportion of the healds towards her, and with them the anterior  threads of the shed; by this motion she opens the shed about 1 inch,  which is not sufficient for the easy passage of the woof. She inserts  her batten edgewise into this opening and then turns it half around on  its long axis, so that its broad surfaces lie horizontally; in this  way the shed is opened to the extent of the width of the batten--about  3 inches; next the weft is passed through. In fig. 42 the batten is  shown lying edgewise (its broad surfaces vertical), as it appears when  just inserted into the shed, and the weft, which has been passed  through only a portion of the shed, is seen hanging out with its end  on the ground. In Plate XXXV the batten is shown in the second  position described, with the shed open to the fullest extent  necessary, and the weaver is represented in the"]]]
