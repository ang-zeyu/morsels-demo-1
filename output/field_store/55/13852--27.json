Round the memories of this contest would gather many older  legends, myths, and stories, not peculiarly Greek or even  'Aryan,' which previously floated unattached, or were  connected with heroes whose fame was swallowed up by that  of a newer generation. It would be the work of minstrels,  priests, and poets, as the national spirit grew conscious  of itself, to shape all these materials into a definite  body of tradition. This is the rule of development--first  scattered stories, then the union of these into a NATIONAL  legend. The growth of later national legends, which we are  able to trace, historically, has generally come about in  this fashion. To take the best known example, we are able  to compare the real history of Charlemagne with the old  epic poems on his life and exploits. In these poems we find  that facts are strangely exaggerated, and distorted; that  purely fanciful additions are made to the true records,  that the more striking events of earlier history are  crowded into the legend of Charles, that mere fairy tales,  current among African as well as European peoples, are  transmuted into false history, and that the anonymous  characters of fairy tales are converted into historical  personages. We can also watch the process by which feigned  genealogies were constructed, which connected the princely  houses of France with the imaginary heroes of the epics.  The conclusion is that the poetical history of Charlemagne  has only the faintest relations to the true history. And we  are justified in supposing that, quite as little of the  real history of events can be extracted from the tale of  Troy, as from the Chansons de Geste.    By the time the Odyssey was composed, it is certain that a  poet had before him a well-arranged mass of legends and  traditions from which he might select his materials. The  author of the Iliad has an extremely full and curiously  consistent knowledge of the local traditions of Greece, the  memories which were cherished by Thebans, Pylians, people  of Mycenae, of Argos, and so on. The Iliad and the Odyssey  assume this knowledge in the hearers of the poems, and take  for granted some acquaintance with other legends, as with  the story of the Argonautic Expedition. Now that story  itself is a tissue of popular tales,--still current in many  distant lands,--but all woven by the Greek genius into the  history of Iason.    The history of the return of Odysseus as told in the  Odyssey, is in the same way, a tissue of old marchen.  These must have existed for an unknown length of time  before they gravitated into the cycle of the tale of Troy.    The extraordinary artistic skill with which legends and  myths, originally unconnected with each other, are woven  into the plot of the Odyssey, so that the marvels of savage  and barbaric fancy become indispensable parts of an  artistic whole, is one of the chief proofs of the unity of  authorship of that poem. We now go on to sketch the plot,  which is a marvel of construction.    Odysseus was the King of Ithaca, a small and rugged island  on the western coast of Greece. When he was but lately  married to Penelope, and while his only son Telemachus was  still an infant, the Trojan war began. It is scarcely  necessary to say that the object of this war, as conceived  of by the poets, was to win back Helen, the wife of  Menelaus, from Paris, the son of Priam, King of Troy. As  Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon, the Emperor, so to  speak, or recognised chief of the petty kingdoms of  'Greece, the whole force of these kingdoms was at his  disposal. No prince came to the leaguer of Troy from a home  more remote than that of Odysseus. When Troy was taken, in  the tenth year of the war, his homeward voyage was the  longest and most perilous.    The action of the Odyssey occupies but the last six weeks  of the ten years during which Odysseus was wandering. Two  nights in these six weeks are taken up, however, by his own  narrative of his adventures (to the Phaeacians, p. xx) in  the previous ten years. With this explanatory narrative we  must begin, before coming to the regular action of the  poem.    After the fall of Troy, Odysseus touched at Ismarus, the  city of a Thracian people, whom he attacked and plundered,  but by whom he was at last repulsed. The north wind then  carried his ships to Malea, the extreme southern point of  Greece. Had he doubled Malea safely, he would probably have  reached Ithaca in a few days, would have found Penelope  unvexed by wooers, and Telemachus a boy of ten years old.  But this was not to be.    The 'ruinous winds' drove Odysseus and his ships for ten  days, and on the tenth they touched the land of the Lotus-  Eaters, whose flowery food causes sweet forgetfulness.  Lotus-land was possibly in Western Libya, but it is more  probable that ten days' voyage from the southern point of  Greece, brought Odysseus into an unexplored region of  fairy-land. Egypt, of which Homer had some knowledge, was  but five days' sail from Crete.    Lotus-land, therefore, being ten days' sail from Malea, was  well over the limit of the discovered world. From this  country Odysseus went on till he reached the land of the  lawless Cyclopes, a pastoral people of giants. Later Greece  feigned that the Cyclopes dwelt near Mount Etna, in Sicily.  Homer leaves their place of abode in the vague.  Among the  Cyclopes, Odysseus had the adventure on which his whole  fortunes hinged. He destroyed the eye of the cannibal  giant, Polyphemus, a son of Poseidon, the God of the Sea.  To avenge this act, Poseidon drove Odysseus wandering for  ten long years, and only suffered him to land in Ithaca,  'alone, in evil case, to find troubles in his house.' This  is a very remarkable point in the plot. The story of the  crafty adventurer and the blinding of the giant, with the  punning device by which the hero escaped, exists in the  shape of a detached marchen or fairy-tale among races who  never heard of Homer. And when we find the story among  Oghuzians, Esthonians, Basques, and Celts, it seems natural  to suppose that these people did not break a fragment out  of the Odyssey, but that the author of the Odyssey took  possession of a legend out of the great traditional store  of fiction. From the wide distribution of the tale, there  is reason to suppose that it is older than Homer, and that  it was not originally told of Odysseus, but was attached to  his legend, as floating jests of unknown authorship are  attributed to eminent wits. It has been remarked with truth  that in this episode Odysseus acts out of character, that  he is foolhardy as well as cunning. Yet the author of the  Odyssey, so far from merely dove-tailing this story at  random into his narrative, has made his whole plot turn on  the injury to the Cyclops. Had he not foolishly exposed  himself and his companions, by his visit to the Cyclops,  Odysseus would never have been driven wandering for ten  weary years. The prayers of the blinded Cyclops were heard  and fulfilled by Poseidon.    From the land of the Cyclops, Odysseus and his company  sailed to the Isle of Aeolus, the king of the winds. This  place too is undefined; we only learn that, even with the  most favourable gale, it was ten days' sail from Ithaca. In  the Isle of Aeolus Odysseus abode for a month, and then  received from the king a bag in which all the winds were  bound, except that which was to waft the hero to his home.  This sort of bag was probably not unfamiliar to  superstitious Greek sailors who had dealings with witches,  like the modern wise women of the Lapps. The companions of  the hero opened the bag when Ithaca was in sight, the winds  rushed out, the ships were borne back to the Aeolian Isle,  and thence the hero was roughly dismissed by Aeolus. Seven  days' sail brought him to Lamos, a city of the cannibal  Laestrygonians. Their country, too, is in No-man's-land,  and nothing can be inferred from the fact that their  fountain was called Artacia, and that there was an Artacia  in Cyzicus. In Lamos a very important adventure befel  Odysseus. The cannibals destroyed all his fleet, save one  ship, with which he made his escape to the Isle of Circe.  Here the enchantress turned part of the crew into swine,  but Odysseus, by aid of the god Hermes, redeemed them, and  became the lover of Circe. This adventure, like the story  of the Cyclops, is a fairy tale of great antiquity. Dr.  Gerland, in his Alt Griechische Marchen in der Odyssee, his  shown that the story makes part of the collection of  Somadeva, a store of Indian tales, of which 1200 A.D. is  the approximate date. Circe appears as a Yackshini, and is  conquered when an adventurer seizes her flute whose magic  music turns men into beasts. The Indian Circe had the habit  of eating the animals into which she transformed men.    We must suppose that the affairs with the Cicones, the  Lotus-eaters, the Cyclops, Aeolus, and the Laestrygonians,  occupied most of the first year after the fall of Troy. A  year was then spent in the Isle of Circe, after which the  sailors were eager to make for home. Circe commanded them  to go down to Hades, to learn the homeward way from the  ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias. The descent into  hell, for some similar purpose, is common in the epics of  other races, such as the Finns, and the South-Sea  Islanders. The narrative of Odysseus's visit to the dead  (book xi) is one of the most moving passages in the whole  poem.    From Teiresias Odysseus learned that, if he would bring his  companions home, he must avoid injuring the sacred cattle  of the Sun, which pastured in the Isle of Thrinacia.  If  these were harmed, he would arrive in Ithaca alone, or in  the words of the Cyclops's prayer, I in evil plight, with  loss of all his company, on board the ship of strangers,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17280"],[0,"Anthropology (#2)"],[1,"up, namely  biology, anthropology may be regarded as a branch of biology. Let it  be added, however, that, of all the branches of biology, it is the  one that is likely to bring us nearest to the true meaning of life;  because the life of human beings must always be nearer to human students  of life than, say, the life of plants.    But, you will perhaps object, anthropology was previously identified  with history, and now it is identified with science, namely, with a  branch of biology? Is history science? The answer is, Yes. I know that  a great many people who call themselves historians say that it is not,  apparently on the ground that, when it comes to writing history, truth  for truth's sake is apt to bring out the wrong results. Well, the  doctored sort of history is not science, nor anthropology, I am ready  to admit. But now let us listen to another and a more serious objection  to the claim of history to be science. Science, it will be said by  many earnest men of science, aims at discovering laws that are clean  out of time. History, on the other hand, aims at no more than the  generalized description of one or another phase of a time-process.  To this it may be replied that physics, and physics only, answers to  this altogether too narrow conception of science. The laws of matter  in motion are, or seem to be, of the timeless or mathematical kind.  Directly we pass on to biology, however, laws of this kind are not  to be discovered, or at any rate are not discovered. Biology deals  with life, or, if you like, with matter as living. Matter moves. Life  evolves. We have entered a new dimension of existence. The laws of  matter in motion are not abrogated, for the simple reason that in  physics one makes abstraction of life, or in other words leaves its  peculiar effects entirely out of account. But they are transcended.  They are multiplied by _x_, an unknown quantity. This being so from  the standpoint of pure physics, biology takes up the tale afresh, and  devises means of its own for describing the particular ways in which  things hang together in virtue of their being alive. And biology finds  that it cannot conveniently abstract away the reference to time. It  cannot treat living things as machines. What does it do, then? It takes  the form of history. It states that certain things have changed in  certain ways, and goes on to show, so far as it can, that the changes  are on the whole in a certain direction. In short, it formulates  tendencies, and these are its only laws. Some tendencies, of course,  appear to be more enduring than others, and thus may be thought to  approximate more closely to laws of the timeless kind. But _x_, the  unknown quantity, the something or other that is not physical, runs  through them all, however much or little they may seem to endure. For  science, at any rate, which departmentalizes the world, and studies  it bit by bit, there is no getting over the fact that living beings  in general, and human beings in particular, are subject to an evolution  which is simple matter of history.    And now what about philosophy? I am not going into philosophical  questions here. For that reason I am not going to describe biology  as natural history, or anthropology as the natural history of man.  Let philosophers discuss what \"nature\" is going to mean for them. In  science the word is question-begging; and the only sound rule in  science is to beg as few philosophical questions as you possibly can.  Everything in the world is natural, of course, in the sense that things  are somehow all akin--all of a piece. We are simply bound to take in  the parts as parts of a whole, and it is just this fact that makes  philosophy not only possible but inevitable. All the same, this fact  does not prevent the parts from having their own specific natures and  specific ways of behaving. The people who identify the natural with  the physical are putting all their money on one specific kind of nature  or behaviour that is to be found in the world. In the case of man they  are backing the wrong horse. The horse to back is the horse that goes.  As a going concern, however, anthropology, as part of evolutionary  biology, is a history of vital tendencies which are not natural in  the sense of merely physical.    What are the functions of philosophy as contrasted with science? Two.  Firstly, it must be critical. It must police the city of the sciences,  preventing them from interfering with each other's rights and free  development. Co-operation by all means, as, for instance, between  anthropology and biology. But no jumping other folks' claims and laying  down the law for all; as, for instance, when physics would impose the  kind of method applicable to machines on the sciences of evolving life.  Secondly, philosophy must be synthetic. It must put all the ways of  knowing together, and likewise put these in their entirety together  with all the ways of feeling and acting; so that there may result a  theory of reality and of the good life, in that organic interdependence  of the two which our very effort to put things together presupposes  as its object.    What, then, are to be the relations between anthropology and  philosophy? On the one hand, the question whether anthropology can  help philosophy need not concern us here. That is for the philosopher  to determine. On the other hand, philosophy can help anthropology in  two ways: in its critical capacity, by helping it to guard its own  claim, and develop freely without interference from outsiders; and  in its synthetic capacity, perhaps, by suggesting the rule that, of  two types of explanation, for instance, the physical and the biological,  the more abstract is likely to be farther away from the whole truth,  whereas, contrariwise, the more you take in, the better your chance  of really understanding.    It remains to speak about policy. I use this term to mean any and all  practical exploitation of the results of science. Sometimes, indeed,  it is hard to say where science ends and policy begins, as we saw in  the case of those gentlemen who would doctor their history, because  practically it pays to have a good conceit of ourselves, and believe  that our side always wins its battles. Anthropology, however, would  borrow something besides the evolutionary principle from biology,  namely, its disinterestedness. It is not hard to be candid about bees  and ants; unless, indeed, one is making a parable of them. But as  anthropologists we must try, what is so much harder, to be candid about  ourselves. Let us look at ourselves as if we were so many bees and  ants, not forgetting, of course, to make use of the inside information  that in the case of the insects we so conspicuously lack.    This does not mean that human history, once constructed according to  truth-regarding principles, should and could not be used for the  practical advantage of mankind. The anthropologist, however, is not,  as such, concerned with the practical employment to which his  discoveries are put. At most, he may, on the strength of a conviction  that truth is mighty and will prevail for human good, invite practical  men to study his facts and generalizations in the hope that, by knowing  mankind better, they may come to appreciate and serve it better. For  instance, the administrator, who rules over savages, is almost  invariably quite well-meaning, but not seldom utterly ignorant of  native customs and beliefs. So, in many cases, is the missionary,  another type of person in authority, whose intentions are of the best,  but whose methods too often leave much to be desired. No amount of  zeal will suffice, apart from scientific insight into the conditions  of the practical problem. And the education is to be got by paying  for it. But governments and churches, with some honourable exceptions,  are still wofully disinclined to provide their probationers with the  necessary special training; though it is ignorance that always proves  most costly in the long run. Policy, however, including bad policy,  does not come within the official cognizance of the anthropologist.  Yet it is legitimate for him to hope that, just as for many years already  physiological science has indirectly subserved the art of medicine,  so anthropological science may indirectly, though none the less  effectively, subserve an art of political and religious healing in  the days to come.           *       *       *       *       *    The third and last part of this chapter will show how, under modern  conditions of science and education, anthropology is to realize its  programme. Hitherto, the trouble with anthropologists has been to see  the wood for the trees. Even whilst attending mainly to the peoples  of rude culture, they have heaped together facts enough to bewilder  both themselves and their readers. The time has come to do some sorting;  or rather the sorting is doing itself. All manner of groups of special  students, interested in some particular side of human history, come  now-a-days to the anthropologist, asking leave to borrow from his stock  of facts the kind that they happen to want. Thus he, as general  storekeeper, is beginning to acquire, almost unconsciously, a sense  of order corresponding to the demands that are made upon him. The goods  that he will need to hand out in separate batches are being gradually  arranged by him on separate shelves. Our best way, then, of proceeding  with the present inquiry, is to take note of these shelves. In other  words, we must consider one by one the special studies that claim to  have a finger in the anthropological pie.    Or, to avoid the disheartening task of reviewing an array of bloodless  \"-ologies,\" let us put the question to ourselves thus: Be it supposed  that a young man or woman who wants to take a course, of at least a  year's length, in the elements of anthropology, joins some university  which is thoroughly in touch with the"]]]
