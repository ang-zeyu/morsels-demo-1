Good Humour, as we  passed by a residence, that had rather an inviting appearance; \"now, is  it not an agreeable spot to live in,\" he continued, as he turned to me  with a look, so assured of confirmation on my part, that I could not  find it in my heart to disappoint him. But as I was about to answer,  Discontent grumbled out a few words, which I think were to the effect,  that where the country was so hideously frightful, that any thing that  was decent attracted notice, but that the same object in England would  not have been regarded; asking me if I had ever travelled through a more  ugly country in my life.    However I felt inclined to check his tendency to condemn all he beheld,  yet I could not in truth otherwise than acknowledge that it was as  uninteresting as it was possible to be, of which every one must be aware  who has travelled from Calais to Boulogne.    Good Humour, however, was still undaunted, and a rather jolly, and very  rosy, looking young female passing at the moment, elicited from him the  exclamation of \"Oh, what a pretty girl, and good natured!\"    \"The very type of fat contented ignorance,\" interrupted Discontent,  without allowing his brother to finish his sentence.    Soon after we entered Boulogne, where the white houses, lively green  shutters, and cleanly appearance of the Grande Rue attracted the  admiration of Good Humour, who observed with his usual energetic  manner, \"What a cheerful pleasant looking town, and how very pretty the  houses are!\"    \"For outside show, well enough, which may be said of most things in  France,\" murmured Discontent; \"but see the inside of those houses, and  you will find there is not a single window or door that shuts or fits as  it ought; and if they are inhabited by French people, you will find  cobwebs and dirt in almost every corner. Am I not right, sir,\" said he,  turning to me with a triumphant air. But before I could answer, Good  Humour took up the cause, observing, \"Really, brother, you cannot speak  from what you have seen, as the Hotel Bourbon is the only house we have  yet entered, and it was impossible to exceed the cleanliness observed  within it; therefore your remarks can only proceed from reports you have  had from others, whose vision, perhaps, was as clouded as your own  appears to be, by a pre-determination to view everything in France in  the most unfavourable light.\" Perceiving that Discontent, by the angry  look which he assumed, was about to reply in a bitter tone to his  brother, I thought the best means of averting the storm would be to  interpose a sort of middle course between them, and remarked that the  gentleman's observation, as to the windows and doors not fitting well,  was very correct, but with regard to the dirtiness of the French it had  been greatly exaggerated.    Discontent declared that he had received his account of France from  persons who had lived long in the country, and on whose judgment he  could rely; \"whereas,\" added he, \"you perhaps have seen but little  either of the nation or of the people.\"    I replied that I had known France nearly fourteen years.    \"Then,\" said he, \"if you have known France so long as that, I suppose  you have become Frenchified yourself.\"    I was about to make a sharp reply, but was prevented by the younger  brother remarking, \"After you have said so much against the French, your  observation to the gentleman was anything but complimentary, and  savoured much of rudeness.\"    \"I merely said I was sure that his brother did not _mean_ to be rude,  and therefore I should not consider his observation in that light.\"    \"Rough and rude I always was, but I did not mean to give offence,\" added  Discontent in a somewhat softened tone.    A fine looking old man, with a profusion of white hair, who was standing  at a cottage door, attracted the notice of Good Humour, who bid us  observe how benevolent was his expression, and what a fine venerable  head he presented.    \"As hoary headed an old sinner as ever existed, I'll be bound,\" said  Discontent, with a sarcastic smile, as he looked scornfully at his  brother.    In this manner we continued to the end of our journey, Discontent  viewing all he encountered with an air of disgust and contempt,  appearing restless, miserable, unhappy and disagreeable, a burthen to  himself and an annoyance to others, whilst Good Humour saw every thing  en _couleur de rose_, was lively, amused, looking the picture of  kindness, and although pleased with a trifle, 'tis true, yet how much  wiser was his course, as it promoted his own happiness and was  calculated to cheer his fellow travellers.    At length we arrived at Abbeville, and I soon perceived the effect that  the knitted brow and curling lip of Discontent had upon the girls that  waited at the table, who seemed but half disposed to attend, to his  demands; whereas the good natured confiding expression of his brother,  with his pleasing address, won all hearts, and he was served with  alacrity and scarcely needed to express his wants; it really is  astonishing how much influence suavity of manners has in France, in  procuring civility and attention, and how opposite is the case with a  repulsive mien.    Before I quit the subject, I must relate one more instance, most  powerfully attesting the veracity of the assertion, which occurred to  myself; after having engaged apartments at the house belonging to a  female, named Fournier, at Boulogne, I was informed by several English  families who had preceded me in the same lodgings, that I had taken up  my abode with the most disagreeable people, who would impose upon us and  annoy us in every possible manner. One exception, however, to this  general report I met with in the account that was given me of our  hostess and family by a Colonel Barry, who with his lady and children  had resided some time with Madame Fournier, and they assured me that we  should find we had chanced upon most worthy people, who would do all in  their power to make us comfortable; but it so happened that the Colonel  and his family were persons of most conciliating manners, devoid of  hauteur in their demeanour, possessing in fact the very qualities  calculated to propitiate a good feeling on the part of the French. After  we had been in the house some time, we observed to those persons who  assured us we should be so ill treated, that we found the case quite the  reverse; and, the answer was, wait until the time comes when, you are  about to depart, and then when you are called upon to produce the  plates, crockery, glasses, knives, forks, etc., you will see who you  have to deal with; if there be any thing in the slightest degree  chipped, they will make you pay extravagantly for damages. But when at  last the awful day of departure arrived, I had every thing collected of  the description alluded to, and Madame Fournier would not even look at  them, and observed if there were any thing injured she was sure it was  to so trifling an amount that it was not worth noticing. But it was not  so with an English lady who was our fellow lodger; towards her they  certainly were neither obliging in their manner nor disposed to render  her any kind of accommodation beyond the strict letter of their  agreement; and the reason was, because she always addressed them as if  she was speaking to her servants; in short, with an arrogance of manner  that they could not brook. Thus whilst they were continually practising  little civilities and attentions towards us, which greatly contributed to  our _comfort_, they were following a totally opposite system towards  her, which rendered her very _uncomfortable_; therefore, had that lady  properly studied her happiness, she would have conducted herself towards  her hostess and family in a very different manner, and I hope my readers  who visit France will take advantage of the hint; yet I must admit that  the lady in question was a very amiable personage in every other  respect, but she detested the French, and liked, as she observed, to  pull down their pride, to make them feel their inferiority, and let them  know that the English were their masters. Madame Fournier, however, was  of a class superior to the generality of persons who let lodgings in  England; she was possessed of an independent property, her eldest  daughter was married to a Colonel, and her son a lieutenant in the navy,  but like many of the French, having a house considerably larger than she  could occupy, she let a part of it. I should always however recommend  the English when they are taking a house or apartment for any length of  time, or in fact entering into any engagement of importance with the  French, to have an agreement in writing, in case of misunderstanding,  which may arise from the English not comprehending, or not expressing  themselves in French so well as they imagine. It is always a document to  refer to which settles all differences, and is a check upon all bad  memories, either on the one side or the other; and as there are bad  people in France as well as other countries, it prevents strangers  becoming victims to those who are disposed to take advantage, when they  are aware that there is no legal instrument to hold them to their  contract. I have lodged in eighteen different houses in France, and  never had any other than a verbal agreement, and certainly had not in  any one instance cause to regret; but was fortunate enough, with one  exception, always to have met with good people; but as I wish my readers  during their sojourn in France to be secured from any unpleasant  discussions or altercations, I recommend them to be on the safe side.    I must now appeal to my two most powerful allies, candour and justice,  against that invincible demon national prejudice. I am perfectly aware  that it is a hopeless attempt even to imagine that there is the  slightest chance of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],[0,"The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#2)"],[1,"fall?\"    She shook her head.    \"Did any of _you_?\" he urged, with his eyes on the crowd. \"Some one must  have been looking that way.\"    But no answer came, and the silence was fast becoming oppressive when  these words, whispered by one woman to another, roused them anew and  sent every glance again to the walls--even hers for whose benefit this  remark had possibly been made:    \"But there are no arrows over there. All the arrows are here.\"    She was right. They were here, quiver after quiver of them; nor were they  all beyond reach. As the woman thus significantly assailed noted this and  saw with what suspicion others noted it also, a decided change took place  in her aspect.    \"I should like to sit down,\" she murmured. Possibly she was afraid she  might fall.    As some one brought a chair, she spoke, but very tremulously, to the  director:    \"Are there no arrows in the rooms over there?\"    \"I am quite sure not.\"    \"And no bows?\"    \"None.\"    \"If--if anyone had been seen in the gallery----\"    \"No one was.\"    \"You are sure of that?\"    \"You heard the question asked. It brought no answer.\"    \"But--but these galleries are visible from below. Some one may have been  looking up from the court and----\"    \"If there was any such person in the building, he would have been here by  this time. People don't hold back such information.\"    \"Then--then--\" she stammered, her eyes taking on a hunted look, \"you  conclude--these people conclude _what_?\"    \"Madam,\"--the word came coldly, stinging her into drawing herself to her  full height,--\"it is not for me to conclude in a case like this. That is  the business of the police.\"    At this word, with its suggestion of crime, her air of conscious power  vanished in sudden collapse. Possibly she had seen the significant  gesture with which the Curator pointed out a quiver from which one of the  arrows was missing. That this was so, was shown by her next question:    \"But where is the bow? Look about on the floor. You will find none. How  can an arrow be shot without a bow?\"    \"It cannot be,\" came from some one at her back. \"But it can be driven  home like a dagger if the hand wielding it is sufficiently powerful.\"    A cry left her lips; she seemed to listen as for some echo; then in a  wild abandonment which ignored person and place she flung herself again  at the dead girl's side, and before the astonished people surrounding her  could intervene, she had caught up the body in her arms, and bending over  it, whispered word after word into the poor child's closed ear.          II    IN ROOM B      Five minutes later the Curator was at the 'phone calling up Police  Headquarters. A death had occurred at the museum. Would they send over  a capable detective?    \"What kind of death?\" was the harsh reply. \"We don't send detectives in  cases of heart-failure or simple accident. Is it an accident?\"    \"No--no--hardly. It looks more like an insane woman's attack upon a  harmless stranger. It's the oddest sort of an affair, and we feel very  helpless. No common officer will do. We have one of that kind in the  building. What we want is a man of brains; he will need them.\"    A muffled sound at the other end--then a different voice asking some  half-dozen comprehensive questions--which, having been answered to the  best of the Curator's ability, were followed by the welcome assurance  that a man on whose experience he could rely would be at the museum doors  within five minutes.    With an air of relief Mr. Jewett stepped again into the court, and  repelling with hasty gestures the importunities of the small group of men  and women who had lacked the courage to follow the more adventurous ones  upstairs, crossed to where the door-man stood on guard over the main  entrance.    \"Locked?\" he asked.    \"Yes, sir. Such were the orders. Didn't you give them?\"    \"No, but I should have done so, had I known. No one's to go out, and no  one's to come in but the detective whom I am expecting any moment.\"    They had not long to wait. Before their suspense had reached fever-point,  a tap was heard on the great door. It was opened, and a young man stepped  in.    \"Coast clear?\" he sang out with a humorous twist of his jaw as he noted  the Curator's evident chagrin at his meager and unsatisfactory  appearance. \"Oh, I'm not your man,\" he added as his eye ran over the  whole place with a look which seemed to take in every detail in an  instant. \"Mr. Gryce is in the automobile. Wait till I help him up.\"    He was gone before the Curator could utter a word, only to reappear in a  few minutes with a man in his wake whom the former at first blush thought  to be as much past the age where experience makes for efficiency as the  other seemed to be short of it.    But this impression, if impression it were, was of short duration. No  sooner had this physically weak but extremely wise old man entered upon  the scene than his mental power became evident to every person there.  Timorous hearts regained their composure, and the Curator--who in his ten  years of service had never felt the burden of his position so acutely as  in the last ten minutes--showed his relief by a volubility quite  unnatural to him under ordinary conditions. As he conducted the  detectives across the court, he talked not of the victim, as might  reasonably be expected, but of the woman who had been found leaning over  her with her hand on the arrow.    \"We think her some escaped lunatic,\" he remarked. \"Only a demented woman  would act as she does. First she denied all knowledge of the girl. Then  when she was made to see that the arrow sticking in the girl's breast had  been taken from a quiver hanging within arm's reach on the wall and used  as lances are used, she fell a-moaning and crying, and began to whisper  in the poor child's senseless ear.\"    \"A common woman? One of a low-down type?\"    \"Not at all. A lady, and an impressive one, at that. You seldom see her  equal. That's what has upset us so. The crime and the criminal do not  seem to fit.\"    The detective blinked. Then suddenly he seemed to grow an inch taller.    \"Where is she now?\" he asked.    \"In Room B, away from the crowd. She is not alone. A young lady detained  with the rest of the people here is keeping her company, to say nothing  of an officer we have put on guard.\"    \"And the victim?\"    \"Lies where she fell, in Section II on the upper floor. There was no call  to move her. She was dead when we came upon the scene. She does not look  to be more than sixteen years old.\"    \"Let's go up. But wait--can we see that section from here?\"    They were standing at the foot of the great staircase connecting the two  floors. Above them, stretching away on either side, ran the two famous,  highly ornamented galleries, with their row of long, low arches  indicating the five compartments into which they were severally divided.  Pointing to the second one on the southern side, the Curator replied:    \"That's it--the one where you see the Apache relics hanging high on the  rear wall. We shall have to shift those to some other place just as soon  as we can recover from this horror. I don't want the finest spot in the  whole museum made a Mecca for the morbid and the curious.\"    The remark fell upon unheeding ears. Detective Gryce was looking, not in  the direction named, but in the one directly opposite to it.    \"I see,\" he quietly observed, \"that there is a clear view across. Was  there no one in the right-hand gallery to see what went on in the left?\"    \"Not that I have heard of. It's the dullest hour of the day, and not only  this gallery but many of the rooms were entirely empty.\"    \"I see. And now, what about the persons who were here? How many of them  have you let go?\"    \"Not one; the doors have been opened twice only--once to admit the  officer you will find on guard, and the other to let in yourself.\"    \"Good! And how many have you here, all told?\"    \"I have not had time to count them, but I should say less than thirty.  This includes myself, as well as two attendants.\"    With a thoughtful air Mr. Gryce turned in the direction of the few  persons he could see huddled together around one of the central statues.    \"Where are the others?\" he asked.    \"Upstairs--in and about the place where the poor child lies.\"    \"They must be got out of there. Sweetwater!\"    The young man who had entered with him was at his side in an instant.    \"Clear the galleries. Then take down the name and address of every person  in the building.\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    Before the last word had left his lips, the busy fellow was halfway up  the marble steps. \"Lightning,\" some of his pals called him, perhaps  because he was as noiseless as he was quick. Meanwhile the senior  detective had drawn the Curator to one side.    \"We'll take a look at these people as they come down. I have been said to  be able to spot a witness with my eyes shut. Let's see what I can do with  my eyes open.\"    \"Young and old, rich and poor,\" murmured the Curator as some dozen  persons appeared at the top of the staircase.    \"Yes,\" sighed the detective, noting each one carefully as he or she filed  down, \"we sha'n't make much out of this experiment. Not one of them  avoids our looks. Emotion enough, but not of the right sort. Well, we'll  leave them to Sweetwater. Our business is above.\"    The Curator offered his arm. The old man made a move to take it--then  drew himself up with an air of quiet confidence.    \"Many thanks,\" said he, \"but I can go alone. Rheumatism is my trouble,  but these mild days loosen its grip upon my poor old muscles.\" He did  not say that the prospect of an interesting inquiry had much the same  effect, but the Curator suspected it, possibly because he was feeling  just a little bit spry himself.    Steeled as such experienced officers necessarily are to death in all its  phases, it was with no common emotion that the aged detective entered the  presence of the dead girl"]]]
