Local and National Houses of Justice      It should be carefully borne in mind that the local as well as the  international Houses of Justice have been expressly enjoined by the  Kitab-i-Aqdas; that the institution of the National Spiritual Assembly, as  an intermediary body, and referred to in the Master's Will as the  \"Secondary House of Justice,\" has the express sanction of 'Abdu'l-Baha;  and that the method to be pursued for the election of the International  and National Houses of Justice has been set forth by Him in His Will, as  well as in a number of His Tablets. Moreover, the institutions of the  local and national Funds, that are now the necessary adjuncts to all local  and national spiritual assemblies, have not only been established by  'Abdu'l-Baha in the Tablets He revealed to the Baha'is of the Orient, but  their importance and necessity have been repeatedly emphasized by Him in  His utterances and writings. The concentration of authority in the hands  of the elected representatives of the believers; the necessity of the  submission of every adherent of the Faith to the considered judgment of  Baha'i Assemblies; His preference for unanimity in decision; the decisive  character of the majority vote; and even the desirability for the exercise  of close supervision over all Baha'i publications, have been sedulously  instilled by 'Abdu'l-Baha, as evidenced by His authenticated and  widely-scattered Tablets. To accept His broad and humanitarian Teachings  on one hand, and to reject and dismiss with neglectful indifference His  more challenging and distinguishing precepts, would be an act of manifest  disloyalty to that which He has cherished most in His life.    That the Spiritual Assemblies of today will be replaced in time by the  Houses of Justice, and are to all intents and purposes identical and not  separate bodies, is abundantly confirmed by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself. He has  in fact in a Tablet addressed to the members of the first Chicago  Spiritual Assembly, the first elected Baha'i body instituted in the United  States, referred to them as the members of the \"House of Justice\" for that  city, and has thus with His own pen established beyond any doubt the  identity of the present Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies with the Houses of  Justice referred to by Baha'u'llah. For reasons which are not difficult to  discover, it has been found advisable to bestow upon the elected  representatives of Baha'i communities throughout the world the temporary  appellation of Spiritual Assemblies, a term which, as the position and  aims of the Baha'i Faith are better understood and more fully recognized,  will gradually be superseded by the permanent and more appropriate  designation of House of Justice. Not only will the present-day Spiritual  Assemblies be styled differently in future, but they will be enabled also  to add to their present functions those powers, duties, and prerogatives  necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of Baha'u'llah, not merely as  one of the recognized religious systems of the world, but as the State  Religion of an independent and Sovereign Power. And as the Baha'i Faith  permeates the masses of the peoples of East and West, and its truth is  embraced by the majority of the peoples of a number of the Sovereign  States of the world, will the Universal House of Justice attain the  plenitude of its power, and exercise, as the supreme organ of the Baha'i  Commonwealth, all the rights, the duties, and responsibilities incumbent  upon the world's future super-state.    It must be pointed out, however, in this connection that, contrary to what  has been confidently asserted, the establishment of the Supreme House of  Justice is in no way dependent upon the adoption of the Baha'i Faith by  the mass of the peoples of the world, nor does it presuppose its  acceptance by the majority of the inhabitants of any one country. In fact,  'Abdu'l-Baha, Himself, in one of His earliest Tablets, contemplated the  possibility of the formation of the Universal House of Justice in His own  lifetime, and but for the unfavorable circumstances prevailing under the  Turkish regime, would have, in all probability, taken the preliminary  steps for its establishment. It will be evident, therefore, that given  favorable circumstances, under which the Baha'is of Persia and of the  adjoining countries under Soviet rule, may be enabled to elect their  national representatives, in accordance with the guiding principles laid  down in 'Abdu'l-Baha's writings, the only remaining obstacle in the way of  the definite formation of the International House of Justice will have  been removed. For upon the National Houses of Justice of the East and the  West devolves the task, in conformity with the explicit provisions of the  Will, of electing directly the members of the International House of  Justice. Not until they are themselves fully representative of the rank  and file of the believers in their respective countries, not until they  have acquired the weight and the experience that will enable them to  function vigorously in the organic life of the Cause, can they approach  their sacred task, and provide the spiritual basis for the constitution of  so august a body in the Baha'i world.          The Institution of Guardianship      It must be also clearly understood by every believer that the institution  of Guardianship does not under any circumstances abrogate, or even in the  slightest degree detract from, the powers granted to the Universal House  of Justice by Baha'u'llah in the Kitab-i-Aqdas, and repeatedly and  solemnly confirmed by 'Abdu'l-Baha in His Will. It does not constitute in  any manner a contradiction to the Will and Writings of Baha'u'llah, nor  does it nullify any of His revealed instructions. It enhances the prestige  of that exalted assembly, stabilizes its supreme position, safeguards its  unity, assures the continuity of its labors, without presuming in the  slightest to infringe upon the inviolability of its clearly-defined sphere  of jurisdiction. We stand indeed too close to so monumental a document to  claim for ourselves a complete understanding of all its implications, or  to presume to have grasped the manifold mysteries it undoubtedly contains.  Only future generations can comprehend the value and the significance  attached to this Divine Masterpiece, which the hand of the Master-builder  of the world has designed for the unification and the triumph of the  world-wide Faith of Baha'u'llah. Only those who come after us will be in a  position to realize the value of the surprisingly strong emphasis that has  been placed on the institution of the House of Justice and of the  Guardianship. They only will appreciate the significance of the vigorous  language employed by 'Abdu'l-Baha with reference to the band of  Covenant-breakers that has opposed Him in His days. To them alone will be  revealed the suitability of the institutions initiated by 'Abdu'l-Baha to  the character of the future society which is to emerge out of the chaos  and confusion of the present age. In this connection, I cannot but feel  amused at the preposterous and fantastic idea that Muhammad-'Ali, the  prime mover and the focal center of unyielding hostility to the person of  'Abdu'l-Baha, should have freely associated himself with the members of  the family of 'Abdu'l-Baha in the forging of a will which in the words of  the writer herself, is but a \"recital of the plottings\" in which for  thirty years Muhammad-'Ali has been busily engaged. To such a hopeless  victim of confused ideas, I feel I can best reply by a genuine expression  of compassion and pity, mingled with my hopes for her deliverance from so  profound a delusion. It was in view of the aforesaid observations, that I  have, after the unfortunate and unavoidable delay occasioned by my ill  health and absence from the Holy Land during the Master's passing,  hesitated to resort to the indiscriminate circulation of the Will,  realizing full well that it was primarily directed to the recognized  believers, and only indirectly concerned the larger body of the friends  and sympathizers of the Cause.          The Animating Purpose of Baha'i Institutions      And now, it behooves us to reflect on the animating purpose and the  primary functions of these divinely-established institutions, the sacred  character and the universal efficacy of which can be demonstrated only by  the spirit they diffuse and the work they actually achieve. I need not  dwell upon what I have already reiterated and emphasized that the  administration of the Cause is to be conceived as an instrument and not a  substitute for the Faith of Baha'u'llah, that it should be regarded as a  channel through which His promised blessings may flow, that it should  guard against such rigidity as would clog and fetter the liberating forces  released by His Revelation. I need not enlarge at the present moment upon  what I have stated in the past, that contributions to the local and  national Funds are of a purely voluntary character; that no coercion or  solicitation of funds is to be tolerated in the Cause; that general  appeals addressed to the communities as a body should be the only form in  which the financial requirements of the Faith are to be met; that the  financial support accorded to a very few workers in the teaching and  administrative fields is of a temporary nature; that the present  restrictions imposed on the publication of Baha'i literature will be  definitely abolished; that the World Unity activity is being carried out  as an experiment to test the efficacy of the indirect method of teaching;  that the whole machinery of assemblies, of committees and conventions is  to be regarded as a means, and not an end in itself; that they will rise  or fall according to their capacity to further the interests, to  coeordinate the activities, to apply the principles, to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19299"],[0,"The Will And Testament of ‘Abdu'l-Bahá (#2)"],[1,"manifest. And now ye are  witnessing how the wrath of God hath from all sides afflicted him and how  day by day he is speeding towards destruction. Ere long will ye behold him  and his associates, outwardly and inwardly, condemned to utter ruin.    What deviation can be greater than breaking the Covenant of God! What  deviation can be greater than interpolating and falsifying the words and  verses of the Sacred Text, even as testified and declared by Mirza  Badi'u'llah! What deviation can be greater than calumniating the Center of  the Covenant himself! What deviation can be more glaring than spreading  broadcast false and foolish reports touching the Temple of God's  Testament! What deviation can be more grievous than decreeing the death of  the Center of the Covenant, supported by the holy verse:--\"He that layeth a  claim ere the passing of a thousand years...,\" whilst he (Muhammad 'Ali)  without shame in the days of the Blessed Beauty had advanced such a claim  as this and been confuted by Him in the aforementioned manner, the text of  his claim being still extant in his own handwriting and bearing his own  seal. What deviation can be more complete than falsely accusing the loved  ones of God! What deviation can be more evil than causing their  imprisonment and incarceration! What deviation can be more severe than  delivering into the hands of the government the Holy Writings and  Epistles, that haply they (the government) might arise intent upon the  death of this wronged one! What deviation can be more violent than  threatening the ruin of the Cause of God, forging and slanderously  falsifying letters and documents so that this might perturb and alarm the  government and lead to the shedding of the blood of this wronged one,--such  letters and documents being now in the possession of the government! What  deviation can be more odious than his iniquity and rebellion! What  deviation can be more shameful than dispersing the gathering of the people  of salvation! What deviation can be more infamous than the vain and feeble  interpretations of the people of doubt! What deviation can be more wicked  than joining hands with strangers and with the enemies of God!    A few months ago, in concert with others, he that hath broken the  Covenant, hath prepared a document teeming with calumny and slander  wherein, the Lord forbid, among many similar slanderous charges,  'Abdu'l-Baha is deemed a deadly enemy, the ill-wisher of the Crown. They  so perturbed the minds of the members of the Imperial Government that at  last a Committee of Investigation was sent from the seat of His Majesty's  Government which, violating every rule of justice and equity that befit  His Imperial Majesty, nay, with the most glaring injustice, proceeded with  its investigations. The ill-wishers of the One True God surrounded them on  every side and explained and excessively enlarged upon the text of the  document whilst they (the members of the Committee) in their turn blindly  acquiesced. One of their many calumnies was that this servant had raised  aloft a banner in this city, had summoned the people together under it,  had established a new sovereignty for himself, had erected upon Mount  Carmel a mighty stronghold, had rallied around him all the peoples of the  land and made them obedient to him, had caused disruption in the Faith of  Islam, had covenanted with the following of Christ and, God forbid, had  purposed to cause the gravest breach in the mighty power of the Crown. May  the Lord protect us from such atrocious falsehoods!    According to the direct and sacred command of God we are forbidden to  utter slander, are commanded to show forth peace and amity, are exhorted  to rectitude of conduct, straightforwardness and harmony with all the  kindreds and peoples of the world. We must obey and be the well-wishers of  the governments of the land, regard disloyalty unto a just king as  disloyalty to God Himself and wishing evil to the government a  transgression of the Cause of God. With these final and decisive words,  how can it be that these imprisoned ones should indulge in such vain  fancies; incarcerated, how could they show forth such disloyalty! But  alas! The Committee of Investigation hath approved and confirmed these  calumnies of my brother and ill-wishers and submitted them to the presence  of His Majesty the Sovereign. Now at this moment a fierce storm is raging  around this prisoner who awaiteth, be it favorable or unfavorable, the  gracious will of His Majesty, may the Lord aid him by His grace to be  just. In whatsoever condition he may be, with absolute calm and quietness,  'Abdu'l-Baha is ready for self-sacrifice and is wholly resigned and  submitted to His Will. What transgression can be more abominable, more  odious, more wicked than this!    In like manner, the focal Center of Hate, hath purposed to put  'Abdu'l-Baha to death and this is supported by the testimony written by  Mirza _Sh_u'a'u'llah himself and is here enclosed. It is evident and  indisputable that they are privily and with the utmost subtlety engaged in  conspiring against me. The following are his very words written by him in  this letter:--\"I curse at every moment him that hath kindled this discord,  imprecate in these words 'Lord! have no mercy upon him' and I hope ere  long God will make manifest the one that shall have no pity on him, who  now weareth another garb and about whom I cannot any more explain.\"  Reference he doth make by these words to the sacred verse that beginneth  as follows:--\"He that layeth a claim ere the passing of a thousand  years...\" Reflect! How intent they are upon the death of 'Abdu'l-Baha!  Ponder in your hearts upon the phrase \"I cannot any more explain\" and  realize what schemes they are devising for this purpose. They fear lest,  too fully explained, the letter might fall into alien hands and their  schemes be foiled and frustrated. The phrase is only foretelling good  tidings to come, namely that regarding this all requisite arrangements  have been made.    O God, my God! Thou seest this wronged servant of Thine, held fast in the  talons of ferocious lions, of ravening wolves, of bloodthirsty beasts.  Graciously assist me, through my love for Thee, that I may drink deep of  the chalice that brimmeth over with faithfulness to Thee and is filled  with Thy bountiful Grace; so that, fallen upon the dust, I may sink  prostrate and senseless whilst my vesture is dyed crimson with my blood.  This is my wish, my heart's desire, my hope, my pride, my glory. Grant, O  Lord my God, and my Refuge, that in my last hour, my end may even as musk  shed its fragrance of glory! Is there a bounty greater than this? Nay, by  Thy Glory! I call Thee to witness that no day passeth but that I quaff my  fill from this cup, so grievous are the misdeeds wrought by them that have  broken the Covenant, kindled discord, showed their malice, stirred  sedition in the land and dishonored Thee amidst Thy servants. Lord! Shield  Thou from these Covenant-breakers the mighty Stronghold of Thy Faith and  protect Thy secret Sanctuary from the onslaught of the ungodly. Thou art  in truth the Mighty, the Powerful, the Gracious, the Strong.    In short, O ye beloved of the Lord! The Center of Sedition, Mirza Muhammad  'Ali, in accordance with the decisive words of God and by reason of his  boundless transgression, hath grievously fallen and been cut off from the  Holy Tree. Verily, we wronged them not, but they have wronged themselves!    O God, my God! Shield Thy trusted servants from the evils of self and  passion, protect them with the watchful eye of Thy loving kindness from  all rancor, hate and envy, shelter them in the impregnable stronghold of  Thy care and, safe from the darts of doubtfulness, make them the  manifestations of Thy glorious Signs, illumine their faces with the  effulgent rays shed from the Dayspring of Thy Divine Unity, gladden their  hearts with the verses revealed from Thy Holy Kingdom, strengthen their  loins by Thy all-swaying power that cometh from Thy Realm of Glory. Thou  art the All-Bountiful, the Protector, the Almighty, the Gracious!    O ye that stand fast in the Covenant! When the hour cometh that this  wronged and broken-winged bird will have taken its flight into the  Celestial Concourse, when it will have hastened to the Realm of the Unseen  and its mortal frame will have been either lost or hidden neath the dust,  it is incumbent upon the Afnan, that are steadfast in the Covenant of God  and have branched from the Tree of Holiness; the Hands, (pillars) of the  Cause of God (the glory of the Lord rest upon them), and all the friends  and loved ones, one and all to bestir themselves and arise with heart and  soul and in one accord, to diffuse the sweet savors of God, to teach His  Cause and to promote His Faith. It behooveth them not to rest for a  moment, neither to seek repose. They must disperse themselves in every  land, pass by every clime, and travel throughout all regions. Bestirred,  without rest, and steadfast to the end, they must raise in every land the  triumphal cry \"Ya Baha'u'l-Abha!\" (O Thou the Glory of Glories), must  achieve renown in the world wherever they go, must burn brightly even as a  candle in every meeting and must kindle the flame of Divine love in every  assembly; that the light of truth may rise resplendent in the midmost  heart of the world, that throughout the East and throughout the West a  vast concourse may gather under the shadow of the Word of God, that the  sweet savors of holiness may be diffused, that faces may shine radiantly,  hearts be filled with the Divine spirit and souls be made heavenly.    In these days, the most important of all things is the guidance of the  nations and peoples of the world. Teaching the Cause is of utmost  importance for it is the head corner-stone of the foundation itself. This  wronged servant has spent his days and nights in promoting the"]]]
