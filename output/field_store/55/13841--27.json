[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17163"],[0,"Mother Stories from the New Testament (#2)"],[1,"Me? Wist ye not  that I must be about My Father's business?\"    Jesus was the Son of God, and doing God's work was being about His  Father's business. Years afterwards He said, \"I came not to do Mine  own will, but the will of Him that sent Me.\"    [Illustration: \"SON, WHY HAST THOU THUS DEALT WITH US?\"]          THE WONDERFUL DRAUGHT OF FISHES      One day, as the crowds pressed round Him to hear the Word of God,  Jesus came to the Lake of Gennesaret and saw two boats drawn up on the  shore. Now one of these belonged to a man named Simon Peter, who was  at the water's edge washing his nets. Jesus entered into this boat and  asked Simon to push it off from the land a little. Then He sat down  and taught the people from the boat. And when He had done speaking to  them He said to Simon, \"Launch out into the deep, and let down your  nets for a draught of fishes.\" Simon, answering Him, said, \"Master, we  have toiled all through the night and have taken nothing, but as you  wish it I will let down the net again.\" And they let down the net into  the sea, but it enclosed so great a multitude of fishes that they  could not draw them up; and the net brake. Then Simon beckoned to his  partners, James and John, who were in the other boat, that they should  come and help them. And they came and filled both boats with the  fishes, so that they began to sink.    When Simon Peter saw it he fell down before Jesus, saying, \"Depart  from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.\" For he and all that were with  him were astonished at the marvellous draught of fishes which they had  taken. And Jesus said unto Simon, \"Fear not, Simon Peter; from  henceforth thou shalt be a fisher of men.\" Meaning that he was to go  about winning souls for God, instead of being a fisherman.    And when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all they  had and followed Christ.    [Illustration: THE WONDERFUL DRAUGHT OF FISHES.]          THE HOUSE BUILT UPON THE SAND.      What a foolish man the builder of the house shown in our picture must  have been! Of course, when the wind blew and the waves dashed against  his house, it would fall. Look how the sea has washed the foundation  away, and how the roof is falling in! And the people; see how they are  fleeing to save their lives! And all this calamity because he built  his house upon the sand. But the other house, shown in the distance:  how firmly that stands! What a bold front it offers to the waves, and  how safely it resists the fury of the storm. Its foundations are sure,  because they rest upon the solid rock.    Jesus had been teaching the people. He had taught them many wonderful  truths, which you will find written in the fifth, sixth, and seventh  chapters of Matthew; and in closing He said, \"Whosoever heareth these  sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man who  built his house upon a rock. And the rain descended, and the floods  came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not,  for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these  sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish  man which built his house upon the sand. And the rain descended, and  the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it  fell, and great was the fall of it.\" The lesson Jesus sought to  impress upon the people by this parable was, that it is not enough  simply to hear what He says. Many will do that; but it is only those  who remember Christ's commandments and keep them, whose work will  stand when the time of trial comes.    [Illustration: THE HOUSE BUILT UPON THE SAND.]          HEALING THE CENTURION'S SERVANT.      Jesus entered into Capernaum, a city by the Sea of Galilee, and while  He was there a certain Centurion, or captain in the Roman army, had a  favourite servant who was sick of the palsy and in great pain. When  this Roman heard of Jesus, he sought the Jewish elders and implored  them to go to Christ and beseech Him to cure the sick servant. And the  elders came to Jesus and besought Him urgently to do this miracle,  saying, \"He is a worthy man, this Roman captain, for he loveth the  Jews and hath built us a synagogue.\"    So Jesus went with them, and when He had come near the house, the  Centurion himself came to meet Him, saying, \"Lord, trouble not  Thyself, for I am not worthy that Thou shouldest enter my house. Speak  the word only, and this sickness shall depart and my servant be made  whole. For I am a man under authority of the Emperor, having many  soldiers under me, and I say unto this man, 'Go,' and he goeth; to  another, 'Come,' and he cometh, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he  doeth it. Wherefore, if I can so readily command my servants to do my  bidding, I know that if Thou biddest this sickness to go out from my  servant it will surely go.\"    Jesus marvelled at the man's words, and said to His followers,  \"Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in  all Israel.\" And to the Centurion He said, \"Go thy way; and as thou  hast believed, so be it done unto thee.\" And his servant was healed in  the selfsame hour, and when those that had been sent returned to the  house, they found the servant whole that had been sick.    [Illustration: CHRIST AND THE CENTURION.]          ANOINTING THE FEET OF JESUS.      On one occasion, a proud Pharisee, whose name was Simon, invited Jesus  to eat with him. But the invitation was a cold one. There was no kiss  of welcome, no water to bathe His hot and dusty feet, no perfumed  ointment for His head: nothing but a bare admission to a vacant place  at the table was granted to Jesus. But there He reclined, His left  elbow resting on a cushion, and His feet projecting beyond the edge of  the couch.    Now it happened that a poor, sinful woman was passing, who,  discovering that Jesus was in the house, timidly entered, and stood  behind Him. She had an alabaster box of ointment, and, as she looked  on Jesus, she wept. Her tears fell upon His feet; so, stooping down,  she tenderly wiped them away with her long hair; then she kissed the  Saviour's feet, and anointed them with the fragrant ointment. This was  done as a token of respect and love.    But an evil eye had noted the kindly act; and the proud Pharisee  thought within himself, if Jesus were the prophet He professes to be,  He would certainly have known that the woman was a great sinner, and  would not have allowed her to touch Him. But Jesus came to save  sinners. He loves them, though He hates their sins. He rebuked the  haughty Simon; and showed him how he had neglected the commonest rites  of hospitality towards his guest, while this poor woman had treated  Jesus with the greatest reverence. Then Jesus said, \"Her sins which  are many are forgiven, for she loved much\"; and He bade her go in  peace.    [Illustration: ANOINTING THE FEET OF JESUS.]          THE RICH FOOL.      There was a certain rich man who owned much land. And his fields and  vineyards were so productive that when the time of harvest came, he  had not room enough to store his corn and fruits. So after much  thought he said, \"This will I do. I will pull down my barns and build  greater ones, and there will I store all my fruits and my goods. Then  I can say to myself, 'I have great store of goods laid up, enough for  many years; now I can take mine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.'\"    But God said unto him, \"Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be  required of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast  hoarded?\"    Jesus says it shall be so with all those who set their minds upon  storing up riches in this world, rather than laying up treasures in  heaven by pleasing God and working in His service. Death will come  when they least expect it, and they will have to leave all their  earthly riches, and go where no treasure has been laid up for them.    And He said unto His disciples, \"Take no thought for your life, what  ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on; for the life  is more than meat, and the body more than raiment. For all these  things do the nations of the world seek after, and your Father knoweth  that ye have need of these things. But rather seek ye the kingdom of  God; and all these things shall be added unto you. Fear not, for it is  the Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell what ye have  and give alms; provide yourselves a treasure in the heavens that  faileth not, where no thief approacheth, or moth corrupteth.\"    [Illustration: THE RICH FOOL.]          THE UNFRUITFUL TREE.      A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came and  sought fruit thereon, but found none. Then he called to the gardener  who attended to his vineyard, and said to him, \"Behold these three  years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none. Cut it  down. Why does it encumber the ground?\"    The gardener answered him and said, \"Lord, let it alone this year  also, till I shall dig about it and manure it. And if it bear fruit  then, it is well; but if not, then, after that, thou shalt cut it  down.\"    In this parable the vineyard means the world, and the fig-tree ungodly  people whose lives do not produce good works--do not produce fruit in  the service of God. The Lord of the vineyard, that is, God, would  destroy such people, but Christ intercedes in their behalf, that time  for repentance may be given. \"He is not willing that any should  perish, but that all should come to repentance.\" Christ came and  sought to change men's hearts, and make their lives fruitful for God.  The warning has been given, and when the Lord of the vineyard comes  again to seek good fruit the unfruitful trees shall be destroyed.        Am I a barren tree, dear Lord?      A cumberer of the ground.      Oh! give me grace to fruitful be,      And in Thy work abound.    [Illustration: THE UNFRUITFUL TREE.]          SOWING THE SEED.      A sower went out to sow his seed,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17164"],[0,"Narrative of a Mission to Central Africa Performed in the Years 1850-51, Volume (#2)"],[1,"fail to be added, that he was always impelled  by a higher motive than the mere satisfaction of curiosity or ambition.  A profound conviction that something might be done towards ameliorating  the condition of the African nations, if we were only better acquainted  with them, seems to have early possessed him. This it was that sustained  and guided his footsteps; and all who knew him unite in testifying that  he concealed beneath a pleasant, cheerful exterior, the character of a  Christian gentleman, and an ardent crusader against the worst form of  oppression which has ever been put in practice. The hope that the public  will unite in this opinion must certainly assist in consoling his widow  for the loss which she has sustained. Mrs. Richardson is alluded to in  the narrative throughout. It is necessary, therefore, to say, that that  lady remained in Tripoli until the news of her bereavement reached her,  and that she then returned to England to promote the erection of this  best monument to her husband's memory.    I have now only to add an account written by Dr. Barth (dated April 3,  1851) of the death of Mr. Richardson, in a letter addressed to Mr.  Crowe, Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General at Tripoli. The German  traveller, as will be seen in the second volume of this work, had  separated from his English companions on the plains of Damerghou, and  proceeded to prosecute other researches, the results of which will be  looked for with great interest:--         \"It was on the 25th of March,\" he says, \"that I heard       accidentally from a Shereef, whom I met on the road, the sad       news that my companion had died, about twenty days before,       in a place called Ungurutua, six days' journey before       reaching Kuka, when I hurried on as fast as my horse would       allow in order to secure his papers and effects from being       lost or destroyed.         \"I now shall send you a short account of Mr. Richardson's       death, as far as I was able to make out the circumstances       from his servant. Mr. Richardson is said to have left Zinder       in the best health, though it is probable that he felt       already very weak while he was there: for, according to the       man whom he hired in Zinder as his dragoman, he had, while       there, a dream that a bird came down from the sky, and when       sitting on the branch of a tree, the branch broke off and       the bird fell down to the earth. Mr. Richardson being very       much affected by this dream, went to a man who from a huge       book explains to the people their dreams. On the man's       telling him that his dream meant death, he seems really to       have anticipated that he would not reach the principal       object of his journey. But, nevertheless, he seemed to be       quite well, mounting even the horse which the Governor of       Zinder had made him a present of, as far as Minyo, when he       begged the Governor to give him a camel, which he mounted       thenceforward. He felt notoriously ill in Kadalebria, eleven       or twelve days' journey from here (Kuka); and he is said by       his servant to have taken different kinds of medicines, one       after the other: from which you may conclude that he did not       know himself what was his illness. Mr. Richardson never       could bear the sun, and the sun being very powerful at this       time of the year, it must have affected him very much. I       think this to be the chief reason of his death; at least, he       seems not to have had a regular fever. He was happy to reach       the large town of Rangarvia after a journey of three short       days, and had the intention of returning from here directly       to Tripoli, without touching at Kuka and the low, hot plain       of Bornou, which he was affrightened of very much. He       offered two hundred mahboubs for a guide to conduct him       directly to the road to Bilma; but there being no road from       here, and no guide having been found, it was necessary first       to go to Kuka.         \"Mr. Richardson, therefore, seems to have taken strong       medicines; in consequence of which, in the evening of the       third day of their halt at Rangarvia, after having taken a       walk through the town, he felt well enough to fix his outset       for the next morning. But this day being rather a long one,       and the sun being very powerful, he became very tired and       unwell; and the more so as, notwithstanding his illness, he       had not left off drinking milk, even on his camel, mixing       some brandy with it. Having recovered a little during the       night, he moved on the next morning, but ordered a halt       about noon, on account of his weakness. Having started again       at sunset, they encamped at midnight. The next day, after a       short journey, they reached the Wady Mettaka. Mr. Richardson       seemed to feel much better, and drank milk and a little       jura, besides rice. From this place, on the last day of       Kebia-el-awel, the caravan, after but a two-hours' march,       reached the village called Ungurutua, when Mr. Richardson       soon felt so weak that he anticipated his death; and leaving       the hut (where he was established) for his tent, told his       dragoman, Mahommed Bu Saad, that he would die. Being       consoled by him that his illness was of no consequence, he       assured him several times that he had no strength at all;       and indeed his pulse ceased almost to beat. He began, then,       to rub his feet with vinegar, and applied the same several       times to his head and shoulders. After which, in the absence       of his servants, he poured water also over himself; so that,       when they returned after a few moments, they found him quite       wet. To counteract the bad effect of this proceeding, they       began to rub him with a little oil. In the evening he took a       little food, and tried to sleep; but notwithstanding that he       seems to have taken something to bring on sleep, he threw       himself restless from one side to the other, calling his       wife several times by her name. After having walked out of       his tent with the assistance of his servant, he ordered tea,       and remained restless on his bed. When it was past midnight,       his old dragoman, Yusuf Moknee, who watched in his tent,       made some coffee, in order to keep himself awake; upon which       Mr. Richardson demanded a cup of coffee for himself; but his       hand being so weak that he could scarcely raise the cup, he       said to Moknee: '_Tergamento Ufa_,'--'Your office as       dragoman is finished;' and repeated several times, with a       broken voice, '_Forza mafishe, forza mafishe le-koul_,'--'I       have no strength, I have no strength, I tell you,' at the       same time laying Mahommed's hand on his shoulder. Feeling       death approaching, he got up in a sitting posture, being       supported by Mahommed, and soon expired, after three times       deep breathing. He was entirely worn out, and died quietly,       about two after midnight, Tuesday, 4th March       (Jumed-el-awel), without the least struggle. His servant       then called into the tent the other people and the Kashalla,       or officer of the Sheikh, who had come along with them from       Zinder, in order to be witness, and while wrapping the body       of the deceased in three shirts which they had cut up,       ordered the people of the village to dig a grave for him.       They then shut up whatever of the luggage of Mr. Richardson       was not locked up, and prepared everything for their journey       to Kuka. Early in the morning they lifted the body, wrapped       up as it was, upon Mr. Richardson's carpet, and carried him       to his grave, which had been dug in the shade of a large       gaw, close to the village, to the depth of four feet. Having       then covered his head and breast with a very large tabah, so       as to protect it from every side, they covered the body with       earth, and had the grave well secured. I have spoken several       times with Haj Beshir that it might be well taken care of,       and I am sure the grave of the traveller, who sacrificed his       life for his great object, will be respected. I send you       with this first kafila all Mr. Richardson's papers and his       journal, which is kept till the 21st February, consisting of       six reams, and his vocabularies, not finished, four reams,       with Yusuf's journal, as well as all his other papers or       letters. I have taken out only the letters of recommendation       of the Mission and the papers concerning the treaty to be       made, as well as a letter from Lousou, one of the Tuaricks,       and another from Ibrahim, the Governor of Zinder, to the       Queen, which I shall enclose in my report to Government. I       send you, besides, an authentic list of all the objects       found in Mr. Richardson's possession, as it has been made up       on the things being deposited with Haj Beshir.         \"I beg you to assure Mrs. Richardson of my most sincere       sympathy, and that I hope she will find a good deal of       consolation in the rich journal of the deceased.\"    I have given the above narrative in the words of Dr. Barth; but must  direct the reader's attention to vol. ii. p. 261, where he will find  that the whole account of the prophetic dream is distorted by the very  unauthentic medium of Oriental report. There is no reason to suppose  that Mr. Richardson was unusually affected by this circumstance,  although any dismal suggestion is likely to disturb a person of  sensibility placed in a dangerous position. The remaining facts, as they  seem confirmed by concurrent testimony, may be taken as a sufficiently  accurate account of the death of this lamented traveller.
