Carnations, harebells, canterbury bells, roses, marigolds, grapes, are  included in the composition; block shading, chain stitch, stem stitch  are all employed in the working, and a very interesting example of the  Opus Plumarian is given in the tail feathers of the tiny peacock.    The dissection of detail in early English crewel embroidery is a very  fascinating occupation and well repays the expenditure of time. So  little has been written about this particular phase of the embroiderer's  art, that it is by old records and examples one becomes best informed  and in a great measure enabled to trace the growth of the style that  culminated in the massive designs that derived their name from the epoch  in which they were in favour. Tudor crewel work, was chiefly done in  broad outline of a more or less fanciful nature as regards the  stitching, witness the sections of that Tudor piece which is shewn in  our first illustration.    Forms were large but gradually became reduced as they were worked more  solidly. The beautiful foxglove pattern in \"Bess of Hardwicke's\"  curtains at Hardwicke, shews a very slight feeling of transition but it  may safely be assumed that one of the influences bearing on the  execution of the crewel work, was the portentous character of much of  the contemporary canvas hand-worked tapestry such as the famous set of  panels unearthed in Hatton Gardens. The architectural basis is a link  between the Ecclesiastical and Secular embroideries of the past  centuries, and anyone interested in the evolution of design would be  struck with the similitude of the large leaves and flowers in these  panels to those of the crewel designs of the same date; it is also  noteworthy that the symbolic significance in the details of the panels  is ecclesiastic, whereas in the crewel work it is always based on the  legend of the Tree of Life, or secularly emblematic.    Colourings were often in both styles, blues, greens, bright yellows and  browns predominated, carnation reds figuring in some examples, used for  the flower of that name and for the pomegranate, which, with its seeds  visible, signifies future life and immortality.    The carnation and the caterpillar were both Stuart emblems, and occur in  nearly all kinds of work executed during their reigns; the rose, of  course, has its national as well as its religious significance, likewise  the oak (after the restoration).    The potato flower seen in both Jacobean and Portuguese embroideries is  an example of the habit of recording the latest novelty, the strawberry  was also popular on this account, and is frequently introduced in those  hillocky foregrounds, which, to me, appear one of the most interesting  evidences of combined influences.    Once again, another Oriental idea was evidently assimilated, for in  numberless Chinese patterns one sees the main motive springing out of a  base of waves formed exactly like the hillocks which became such a  distinctive feature in these large branching designs.    In the earliest examples the hillocks were much broken up, and smaller  (more like the mounds in the painted Palampores) than in the later work,  from which we may presume the spread of the Oriental influence had done  its work, the \"terra firma\" being carried out with a similitude to the  eastern version of waves that includes the actual stitchery; grafted on  to this was the legend of the pursuit of the human soul (typified by a  hart) by evil, personified by the huntsman, the hounds and various  uncanny beasts, two bearing unflattering resemblance to the heraldic  lion and leopard; while rabbits, snails, grubs of all kind hinder the  hart's progress, these are relics of the days when The Bestiarta  (symbolism of beasts) was carefully studied.    The riotous re-action from the Puritan rule was reflected in the  embroideries of the restoration, as in everything else, and patterns  became exuberant, colouring more brilliant, the exquisite stitchery  gradually gave place to the easier achievement of solid fillings, and  the requisite relief was secured by light sprays filling up the ground  between the larger leaves, jasmine, cherries, harebells, potato  flowers, honeysuckle, shamrock or trefoil and acorns took the lead.    It is an almost impossible task to describe the large leaves, since they  bear no resemblance to anything natural, they are, however, rarely  angular in outline, rejoicing rather in sweeping curves, and drooping  points, curled over to display the under side of the leaf, a device that  gave opening for much ingenuity in the arrangement of the stitches. The  variety in these was so great that on reading the enumeration made by  Taylor, the Water Poet, one becomes quite breathless. The predominating  ones, however, are--_Outline or Stem Stitch_, used for all but the  largest stems, and veining and outlining leaves and flowers.    _Shading Stitch_, sometimes called long and short, used for large  branches and leaves, _Basket_ and _Double Back Stitch_ are also used for  these stems.    _Satin Stitch_, for all kinds of flowers and small foliage, or for the  definite flat shading, that is like block shading without the ridge  caused by the carrying back of the wool into the past row of stitches.    _Buttonhole_, also much used for leaves, especially those having light  fillings and broad outlines.    _Rope Stitch_, _Coral_, _Cable_ and _Chain_, also for outlines, the last  named being also used for fillings.    The fancy fillings such as darning, French knots, etc., are demonstrated  and described in the following pages, and the colour plates endeavour to  give the idea of the correct colourings. In this connection, a few  observations, based on the study of genuine originals, may not be amiss.    As I have before mentioned, a certain brilliancy characterised the work  at one period, but this cannot be regarded as the best type to imitate.  The most harmonious were carried out in two schemes. One had all the  leaves worked in Mandarin blues, shading from darkest indigo to softest  blue-grey. These were placed in juxtaposition, with tender mignonette  and silvery greens, a strong accent being _occasionally_ introduced by a  flower or filling carried out in true rose leaf shade or by veinings of  bronze greens and browns.    The other scheme, and this is more rarely met with, was in bronze greens  throughout, intermixed with yellow and about three shades of the dull  blues. Black sometimes is to be noticed in both these colour schemes,  also bright and buff yellows and chestnut browns, and the colours were  mostly confined to the blue scheme first named, but there are examples  extant of an entire design carried out in shades of red, as in the Tudor  and early 16th century hangings one finds blues responsible for the  whole colouring. These vary in tone, and in the late copies of the  designs the blue has a very green tinge about it.[2]    In the reign of Queen Anne taste reverted to the older lighter designs,  grotesques were eliminated, massiveness gave place to grace, and  brightness of colour to a soft modified brilliancy that was very  engaging. In the Georgian copies heaviness again obtained favour, and  gradually the designs deteriorated, and were eventually temporarily lost  in \"the limbo of the past.\" The vogue for lace work in the reign of  William and Mary influenced the stitches in the crewel embroidery, and  in Queen Anne's day the variety of stitches was reminiscent of the  earlier period, some of the fillings being beautiful.    The material used was through all the phases the same, viz., a twill  fabric, of which the warp was of linen, the weft of cotton; the wools  varied somewhat in the twist, but were always worsted, the word crewel  being a diminutive of clew, \"a ball of thread,\" and probably came into  vogue with the importation of wools from Germany, the corresponding word  in that language being _Knaeuel_.    A. F. MORRIS HANDS    [1] Opus Anglicum by M. Louis de Farcy in \"Embroidery.\"    [2] See example in South Kensington carried out in very hard twisted  blue wools. The curtain belonging to Mr. Hearn, and now at South  Kensington, is a beautiful specimen of the full colouring of the late  17th century.          Op. I    [Illustration]    PLATE 1      This plate was sketched from a very old strip of Tudor work, measuring  about 5ft. 8in. in length and 1ft. 8in. in width. Each leaf was about  22in. long and 19in. across. The strip had evidently been part of a bed  valance, and, as far as one could tell--for it was much faded--had been  worked in two shades of wool only--dark indigo blue and bright green;  the latter had faded, almost everywhere, to a soft mignonette colour.
