Place the grease fat and lobster  dice in a soup tureen, strain the boiling soup over them, and serve at  once.      ~BISQUE OF OYSTERS~--Place about thirty medium-sized oysters in a  saucepan together with their own juice and poach them over a hot fire,  after which drain well; then fry a shallot colorless in some butter,  together with an onion, sprinkle over them a little curry and add some  of the oyster juice, seasoning with salt and red pepper. Pound the  oysters to a good firm paste, moistening them with a little of their  juice, and strain through fine tammy cloth. Warm them over the fire, but  do not let them boil; add a small quantity of thickening of potato flour  mixed with a little water. When about to serve incorporate some cream  and fine butter, garnishing with some chopped oysters and mushrooms,  mixed with breadcrumbs and herbs. Add a little seasoning of salt, pepper  and nutmeg, some raw egg yolks, and roll this mixture into ball-shape  pieces, place them on a well-buttered baking sheet in a slack oven and  poach them, then serve.      ~BLACK BEAN SOUP~--Wash one pint of black beans, cover with one quart of  cold water and let soak over night. In the morning pour off the water  and pour over three pints of cold water. Cook, covered, until tender,  four or five hours, add one tablespoonful of salt the last hour, rub  through a strainer, add the strained beans to the water in which they  were boiled, return to the soup kettle. Melt one tablespoonful of flour,  stir this into the hot soup, let boil, stirring constantly; add a little  pepper, slice thinly one lemon, put all the slices into the tureen and  pour the soup over. Serve very hot.      ~CHESTNUT SOUP~--Peel and blanch the chestnuts, boil them in salted  water until quite soft, pass through a sieve, add more water if too  thick, and a spoonful of butter or several of sweet cream. Season to  taste and serve with small squares of bread fried crisp in butter or  olive oil.      ~CHICKEN GUMBO, CREOLE STYLE~--For about twelve or fifteen, one young  hen chicken, half pound ham, quart fresh okra, three large tomatoes, two  onions, one kernel garlic, one small red pepper, two tablespoons flour,  three quarts boiling water, half pound butter, one bay leaf, pinch salt  and cayenne pepper. To mix, mince your ham, put in the bottom of an  iron kettle if preferred with the above ingredients except the chicken.  Clean and cut your chicken up and put in separate saucepan with about a  quart or more of water and teaspoonful of salt; set to the side of the  fire for about an hour; skim when necessary. When the chicken is  thoroughly done strip the meat from the bone and mix both together; just  before serving add a quart of shrimps.      ~CREAM OF CELERY SOUP~--Chop fine one head of celery and put on to cook  in one pint of water. Boil until tender, add one pint of milk, thicken  with a spoonful of butter, season to taste, and strain. Then add one  cupful of whipped cream and serve at once.      ~EGG SOUP~--Beat three eggs until light, then add one-half cupful of  thick sweet cream and one cupful of milk, pour over this two quarts of  boiling water, set on the fire until it comes to a boil, season to  taste, then pour over broken bread in the tureen and serve.      ~GREEN PEA SOUP~--Put one quart of green peas into two cups of boiling  water, add a saltspoon of salt, and cook until tender. Rub peas and  liquor through a puree strainer, add two cups of boiling water, and set  back where the pulp will keep hot. Heat two cups of milk, add a teaspoon  of flour rubbed into a rounding tablespoon of butter, season with salt,  pepper, and a level teaspoon of sugar. Add to the hot vegetable pulp,  heat to the boiling point, and serve.      ~GREEN TOMATO SOUP~--Chop fine five green tomatoes and boil twenty  minutes in water to cover. Then add one quart hot milk, to which a  teaspoonful soda has been added, let come to a boil, take from the fire  and add a quarter cupful butter rubbed into four crackers rolled fine,  with salt and pepper to taste.      ~ONION SOUP~--Cut three onions small, put one-quarter cup of butter in a  kettle and toast one tablespoon flour till bright yellow in color; in it  mix with this the onions, pour on as much broth as is wanted, add a  little mace and let boil, then strain, allow to cook a little longer,  add yolk of two eggs, and serve.      ~PEANUT SOUP~--Made like a dry pea soup. Soak a pint and one-half nut  meats over night in two quarts of water. In the morning add three quarts  of water, bay-leaf, stalk of celery, blade of mace and one slice of  onion. Boil slowly for four or five hours, stirring frequently to keep  from burning. Rub through a sieve and return to the fire, when heated  through again add one cupful of cream. Serve hot with croutons.      ~SAGO SOUP~--Wash one-half cup sago in warm water, add desired amount of  boiling broth (meat or chicken), a little mace, and cook until the sago  is soft, and serve.      ~SALMON SOUP~--Take the skin and bones from canned salmon and drain off  the oil. Chop fine enough of the fish to measure two-thirds of a cup.  Cook a thick slice of onion in a quart of milk twenty minutes in a  double boiler. Thicken with one-quarter cup of flour rubbed smooth with  one rounding tablespoonful of butter. Cook ten minutes, take out the  onion, add a saltspoon of pepper, one level teaspoon of salt and the  salmon. Rub all through a fine strainer, and serve hot. The amount of  salmon may be varied according to taste.      ~SORREL SOUP~--Wash thoroughly a pint of sorrel leaves and put in a  saucepan with two tablespoonfuls of butter, four or five of the large  outside leaves, a sliced onion, and a few small sprigs of parsley. Toss  over the fire for a few minutes, then sift into the pan two  tablespoonfuls of flour and stir until blended with the butter  remaining. Transfer to the soup kettle and pour in gradually, stirring  all the time, three quarts of boiling water. Cook gently for fifteen or  twenty minutes, then add a cupful of mashed potato and one of hot milk.  Season with salt, pepper and a little nutmeg. Have in the soup tureen  some croutons of bread toasted brown, pour the hot soup over them and  serve. The sorrel should be cut in fine pieces before cooking. This is  one of the delicacies of the early spring, its slightly acid flavor  making it particularly appetizing.      ~TOMATO SOUP~--Put one quart can of tomatoes, two cups of water,  one-half level tablespoon of sugar, one level teaspoon of salt, four  whole cloves, and four peppercorns together in a saucepan and simmer  twenty minutes. Fry a rounding tablespoon of chopped onion and half as  much minced parsley in a rounding tablespoon of butter until yellow, add  two level tablespoons of cornstarch. Stir until smooth, then turn into  the boiling soup and simmer ten minutes. Add more salt and pepper and  strain.      ~TOMATO SOUP~--Into a saucepan put one quart can of tomatoes and two  cups of broth from soup bones. To make this cover the bones and meat  with cold water and simmer slowly for several hours. Add to tomato and  stock a bit of bay leaf, one stalk celery cut in pieces, six  peppercorns, a level teaspoon of salt and a rounding teaspoon of sugar.  Cook slowly until tomato is soft. Meanwhile put a rounding tablespoon of  butter in a small saucepan and when melted and hot turn in a  medium-sized onion cut fine. When this has cooked slowly until yellow,  but not browned, add enough of the tomato to dilute it, then turn all  back into the larger saucepan. Mix and press through a strainer to take  out the seeds and bits of vegetables, reheat, and serve with small  croutons.      ~TOMATO SOUP, CORNED BEEF STOCK~--Put one quart can tomatoes on to boil,  add six peppercorns, one-half inch blade of mace and a bit of bay leaf  the same size. Fry one sliced onion in one level tablespoonful butter or  beef fat until slightly colored, add this to the tomato, and simmer  until the tomato is quite soft, and the liquor reduced one-half. Stir in  one-fourth teaspoon of soda, and when it stops foaming turn into a puree  strainer and rub the pulp through. Put the strained tomato on to boil  again and add an equal amount of corned beef liquor, or enough to make  three pints in all.    Melt one heaped tablespoon butter in a smooth saucepan, add one heaped  tablespoon cornstarch, and gradually add part of the boiling soup. Stir  as it thickens, and when smooth stir this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18440"],[0,"Logic: Deductive and Inductive (#2)"],[1," Special Canons of the Four Figures                              126  Sec.6.
