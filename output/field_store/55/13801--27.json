[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16459"],[0,"Musical Memories (#2)"],[1,"the  beginnings of his invention, is exceedingly interesting. This invention  consisted of a rod placed in front of the keyboard. The forearm rested  on this rod in such a way that all muscular action save that of the hand  was suppressed. This system is excellent for teaching the young pianist  how to play pieces written for the harpsichord or the first pianofortes  where the keys responded to slight pressure; but it is inadequate for  modern works and instruments. It is the way one ought to begin, for it  develops firmness of the fingers and suppleness of the wrist, and, by  easy stages, adds the weight of the forearm and of the whole arm. But in  our day it has become the practice to begin at the end. We learn the  elements of the fugue from Sebastian Bach's _Wohltemperirte Klavier_,  the piano from the works of Schumann and Liszt, and harmony and  instrumentation from Richard Wagner. All too often we waste our efforts,  just as singers who learn roles and rush on the stage before they know  how to sing ruin their voices in a short time.    Firmness of the fingers is not the only thing that one learns from  Kalkbrenner's method, for there is also a refinement of the quality of  the sound made by the fingers alone, a valuable resource which is  unusual in our day.    Unfortunately, this school invented as well continuous _legato_, which  is both false and monotonous; the abuse of nuances, and a mania for  continual _expressio_ used with no discrimination. All this was opposed  to my natural feelings, and I was unable to conform to it. They  reproached me by saying that I would never get a really fine effect--to  which I was entirely indifferent.    When I was ten, my teacher decided that I was sufficiently prepared to  give a concert in the Salle Pleyel, so I played there, accompanied by an  Italian orchestra, with Tilmant as the conductor. I gave Beethoven's  _Concerto in C minor_ and one of Mozart's concertos in B flat. There was  some question of my playing at the Societe des Concerts du  Conservatoire, and there was even a rehearsal. But Seghers, who  afterwards founded the Societe St. Cecile, was a power in the affairs of  the orchestra. He detested Stamaty and told him that the Societe was not  organized to play children's accompaniments. My mother felt hurt and  wanted to hear nothing more of it.    After my first concert, which was a brilliant success, my teacher  wanted me to give others, but my mother did not wish me to have a career  as an infant prodigy. She had higher ambitions and was unwilling for me  to continue in concert work for fear of injuring my health. The result  was that a coolness sprang up between my teacher and me which ended our  relations.    At that time my mother made a remark which was worthy of Cornelia. One  day some one remonstrated with her for letting me play Beethoven's  sonatas. \"What music will he play when he is twenty?\" she was asked. \"He  will play his own,\" was her reply.           *       *       *       *       *    The greatest benefit I got from my experience with Stamaty was my  acquaintance with Maleden, whom he gave me as my teacher in composition.  Maleden was born in Limoges, as his accent always showed. He was thin  and long-haired, a kind and timid soul, but an incomparable teacher. He  had gone to Germany in his youth to study with a certain Gottfried  Weber, the inventor of a system which Maleden brought back with him and  perfected. He made it a wonderful tool with which to get to the depths  of music--a light for the darkest corners. In this system the chords are  not considered in and for themselves--as fifths, sixths, sevenths--but  in relation to the pitch of the scale on which they appear. The chords  acquire different characteristics according to the place they occupy,  and, as a result, certain things are explained which are, otherwise,  inexplicable. This method is taught in the Ecole Niedermeuer, but I  don't know that it is taught elsewhere.    Maleden was extremely anxious to become a professor at the  Conservatoire. As the result of powerful influence, Auber was about to  sign Maleden's appointment, when, in his scrupulous honesty, he thought  he ought to write and warn him that his method differed entirely from  that taught in the institution. Auber was frightened and Maleden was not  admitted.    Our lessons were often very stormy. From time to time certain questions  came up on which I could not agree with him. He would then take me  quietly by the ear, bend my head and hold my ear to the table for a  minute or two. Then, he would ask whether I had changed my mind. As I  had not, he would think it over and very often he would confess that I  was right.    \"Your childhood,\" Gounod once told me, \"wasn't musical.\" He was wrong,  for he did not know the many tokens of my childhood. Many of my attempts  are unfinished--to say nothing of those I destroyed--but among them are  songs, choruses, cantatas, and overtures, none of which will ever see  the light. Oblivion will enshroud these gropings after effect, for they  are of no interest to the public. Among these scribblings I have found  some notes written in pencil when I was four. The date on them leaves no  doubt about the time of their production.          CHAPTER II    THE OLD CONSERVATOIRE      I cannot let the old Conservatoire in the Rue Bergere go without paying  it a last farewell, for I loved it deeply as we all love the things of  our youth. I loved its antiquity, the utter absence of any modern note,  and its atmosphere of other days. I loved that absurd court with the  wailing notes of sopranos and tenors, the rattling of pianos, the blasts  of trumpets and trombones, the arpeggios of clarinets, all uniting to  form that ultra-polyphone which some of our composers have tried to  attain--but without success. Above all I loved the memories of my  education in music which I obtained in that ridiculous and venerable  palace, long since too small for the pupils who thronged there from all  parts of the world.    I was fourteen when Stamaty, my piano teacher, introduced me to  Benoist, the teacher of the organ, an excellent and charming man,  familiarly known as \"Father Benoist.\" They put me in front of the  keyboard, but I was badly frightened, and the sounds I made were so  extraordinary that all the pupils shouted with laughter. I was received  at the Conservatoire as an \"auditor.\"    So there I was only admitted to the honor of listening to others. I was  extremely painstaking, however, and I never lost a note or one of the  teacher's words. I worked and thought at home, studying hard on  Sebastian Bach's _Wohltemperirte Klavier_. All of the pupils, however,  were not so industrious. One day, when they had all failed and Benoist,  as a result, had nothing to do, he put me at the organ. This time no one  laughed and I at once became a regular pupil. At the end of the year I  won the second prize. I would have had the first except for my youth and  the inconvenience of having me leave a class where I needed to stay  longer.    That same year Madeleine Brohan won the first prize in comedy. She  competed with a selection from _Misanthrope_, and Mlle. Jouassin gave  the other part of the dialogue. Mlle. Jouassin's technique was the  better, but Madeleine Brohan was so wonderful in beauty and voice that  she carried off the prize. The award made a great uproar. To-day, in  such a case, the prize would be divided. Mlle. Jouassin won her prize  the following year. After leaving school, she accepted and held for a  long time an important place at the Comedie-Francaise.    Benoist was a very ordinary organist, but an admirable teacher. A  veritable galaxy of talent came from his class. He had little to say,  but as his taste was refined and his judgment sure, nothing he said  lacked weight or authority. He collaborated in several ballets for the  Opera and that gave him a good deal of work to do. It sounds incredible,  but he used to bring his \"work\" to class and scribble away on his  orchestration while his pupils played the organ. This did not prevent  his listening and looking after them. He would leave his work and make  appropriate comments as though he had no other thought.    In addition to his ballets, Benoist did other little odd jobs for the  Opera. As a result one day, without thinking, he gave me the key to a  deep secret. In his famous _Traite d'Instrumentation_ Berlioz spoke of  his admiration for a passage in Sacchini's _Oedipus a Colone_. Two  clarinets are heard in descending thirds of real charm just before the  words, \"_Je connus la charmante Eriphyle._\" Berlioz was enthusiastic and  wrote:    \"We might believe that we really see Eriphyle chastely kiss his eyes. It  is admirable. And yet,\" he adds, \"there is no trace of this effect in  Sacchini's score.\"    Now Sacchini, for some reason or other which I do not know, did not use  clarinets once in the whole score. Benoist was commissioned to add them  when the work was revived, as he told me as we were chatting one day.  Berlioz did not know this, and Benoist, who had not read Berlioz's  _Traite_, knew nothing of the romantic musician's enthusiastic  admiration of his work. These happily turned thirds, although they  weren't Sacchini's, were, none the less, an excellent innovation.    Benoist was less happy when he was asked to put some life into  Bellini's _Romeo_ by using earsplitting outbursts of drums, cymbals, and  brass. During the same noise-loving period Costa, in London, gave  Mozart's _Don Juan_ the same treatment. He let loose throughout the  opera the trombones which the author intentionally reserved for the end.  Benoist ought to have refused to do such a barbarous piece of work.  However, it had no effect in preventing the failure of a worthless  piece, staged at great expense by the management which had rejected Les  Troyens.    I was fifteen when I entered Halevy's class.

The cables and the great ocean steamship lines, which connected  South Africa with Europe and America, were owned by British companies, and  naturally they were employed by the British Government for its own  purposes. Nothing which might in any way benefit the Boers was allowed to  pass over these lines and, so far as it was possible, the British  Government attempted to isolate the republics so that the outside world  could have no communication of any sort with them. With the exception of a  small strip of coast-land on the Indian ocean, the two republics were  completely surrounded by British territory, and consequently it was not a  difficult matter for the great Empire to curtail the liberties of the  Boers to as great an extent as it was pleasing to the men who conducted  the campaign. The small strip of coast-land, however, was the property of  a neutral nation, and, therefore, could not be used for British purposes  of stifling the Boer countries, but the nation which \"rules the waves\"  exhausted every means to make the Boers' air-hole as small as possible by  placing a number of warships outside the entrance of Delagoa Bay, and by  establishing a blockade of the port of Lorenzo Marques.    Lorenzo Marques, in itself, was valueless to the Boers, for it had always  been nothing more than a vampire feeding upon the Transvaal, but as an  outlet to the sea and as a haven for foreign ships bearing men, arms, and  encouragement it was invaluable. In the hands of the Boers Delagoa Bay  would have been worse than useless, for the warships could have taken  possession of it and sealed it tightly on the first day of the war, but as  a Portuguese possession it was the only friend that the Boers were able to  find during their long period of need. Without it, the Boers would have  been unable to hold any intercourse with foreign countries, no envoys  could have been despatched, no volunteers could have entered the country,  and they would have been ignorant of the opinion of the world--a factor in  the brave resistance against their enemy which was by no means  infinitesimal. Delagoa Bay was the Boers' one window through which they  could look at the world, and through which the world could watch the brave  struggle of the farmer-citizens of the veld-republics.    The Portuguese authorities at Delagoa Bay long ago established a  reputation for adroitness in extracting revenues whenever and wherever it  was possible to find a stranger within their gates, but the war afforded  them such excellent opportunities as they had never enjoyed before. Being  the gate of the Boer country was a humanitarian privilege, but it also was  a remunerative business, and never since Vasco de Gama discovered the port  were so many choice facilities afforded for increasing the revenue of the  colony. Nor was the Latin's mind wanting in concocting schemes for filling  the Portuguese coffers when the laws were lax on the subject, for it was  the simplest arrangement to frame a regulation suitable for every new  condition that arose. The Portuguese were willing to be the medium between  the Boers and the people of other parts of the earth, but they asked for  and received a large percentage of the profits.    When the mines of the Johannesburg gold district were closed down, and the  Portuguese heard that they would no longer receive a compulsory  contribution of four shillings from every native who crossed the border to  work in the mines, the officials"]]]
