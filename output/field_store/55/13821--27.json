Many as were the charges brought against them by hostile  Confucians, it was never suggested that they sought political or  commercial privileges for their native land. It was this simple  disinterested attitude which enabled Buddhism, though in many ways  antipathetic to the Far East, to win its confidence.    Ceylon is the first place where we have a record of the introduction  of Indian civilization and its entry there illustrates all the  phenomena mentioned above, infiltration, colonization and propaganda.  The island is close to the continent and communication with the Tamil  country easy, but though there has long been a large Tamil population  with its own language, religion and temples, the fundamental  civilization is not Tamil. A Hindu called Vijaya who apparently  started from the region of Broach about 500 B.C. led an expedition to  Ceylon and introduced a western Hindu language. Intercourse with the  north was doubtless maintained, for in the reign of Asoka we find the  King of Ceylon making overtures to him and receiving with enthusiasm  the missionaries whom he sent. It is possible that southern India  played a greater part in this conversion than the accepted legend  indicates, for we hear of a monastery built by Mahinda near  Tanjore.[3] But still language, monuments and tradition attest the  reality of the connection with northern India.    It is in Asoka's reign too that we first hear of Indian influence  spreading northwards. His Empire included Nepal and Kashmir, he  sent missionaries to the region of Himavanta, meaning apparently the  southern slopes of the Himalayas, and to the Kambojas, an ambiguous  race who were perhaps the inhabitants of Tibet or its border lands.  The Hindu Kush seems to have been the limit of his dominions but  tradition ascribes to this period the joint colonization of Khotan  from India and China.    Sinhalese and Burmese traditions also credit him with the despatch of  missionaries who converted Suvarnabhumi or Pegu. No mention of this  has been found in his own inscriptions, and European critics have  treated it with not unnatural scepticism for there is little  indication that Asoka paid much attention to the eastern frontiers of  his Empire. Still I think the question should be regarded as being  _sub judice_ rather than as answered in the negative.    Indian expeditions to the East probably commenced, if not in the reign  of Asoka, at least before our era. The Chinese Annals[4] state that  Indian Embassies reached China by sea about 50 B.C. and the Questions  of Milinda allude to trade by this route: the Ramayana mentions Java  and an inscription seems to testify that a Hindu king was reigning in  Champa (Annam) about 150 A.D. These dates are not so precise as one  could wish, but if there was a Hindu kingdom in that distant region in  the second century it was probably preceded by settlements in nearer  halting places, such as the Isthmus of Kra[5] or Java, at a  considerably anterior date, although the inscriptions discovered there  are not earlier than the fifth century A.D.    Java seems to have left some trace in Indian tradition, for instance  the proverb that those who go to Java do not come back, and it may  have been an early distributing centre for men and merchandize in  those seas. But Ligor probably marks a still earlier halting place. It  is on the same coast as the Mon kingdom of Thaton, which had  connection with Conjevaram by sea and was a centre of Pali Buddhism.  At any rate there was a movement of conquest and colonization in these  regions which brought with it Hinduism and Mahayanism, and established  Hindu kingdoms in Java, Camboja, Champa and Borneo, and another  movement of Hinayanist propaganda, apparently earlier, but of  which we know less.[6] Though these expeditions both secular and  religious probably took ship on the east coast of India, _e.g._ at  Masulipatam or the Seven Pagodas, yet their original starting point  may have been in the west, such as the district of Badami or even  Gujarat, for there were trade routes across the Indian Peninsula at an  early date.[7]    It is curious that the early history of Burma should be so obscure and  in order not to repeat details and hypotheses I refer the reader to  the chapter dealing specially with this country. From an early epoch  Upper Burma had connection with China and Bengal by land and Lower  Burma with Orissa and Conjevaram by sea. We know too that Pali  Buddhism existed there in the sixth century, that it gained greatly in  power in the reign of Anawrata (_c._ 1060) and that in subsequent  centuries there was a close ecclesiastical connection with Ceylon.    Siam as a kingdom is relatively modern but like Burma it has been  subject to several influences. The Siamese probably brought some form  of Buddhism with them when they descended from the north to their  present territories. From the Cambojans, their neighbours and at one  time their suzerains, they must have acquired some Hinduism and  Mahayanism, but they ended by adopting Hinayanism. The source was  probably Pegu but learned men from Ligor were also welcomed and the  ecclesiastical pre-eminence of Ceylon was accepted.    We thus see how Indian influence conquered Further India and the Malay  Archipelago and we must now trace its flow across Central Asia to  China and Japan, as well as the separate and later stream which  irrigated Tibet and Mongolia.    Tradition as mentioned ascribes to Asoka some connection with Khotan  and it is probable that by the beginning of our era the lands of the  Oxus and Tarim had become Buddhist and acquired a mixed civilization  in which the Indian factor was large. As usual it is difficult to give  precise dates, but Buddhism probably reached China by land a little  before rather than after our era and the prevalence of Gandharan art  in the cities of the Tarim basin makes it likely that their  efflorescence was not far removed in time from the Gandharan epoch of  India. The discovery near Khotan of official documents written in  Prakrit makes colonization as well as religious missions probable.  Further, although the movements of Central Asian tribes commonly took  the form of invading India, yet the current of culture was, on the  whole, in the opposite direction. The Kushans and others brought with  them a certain amount of Zoroastrian theology and Hellenistic art, but  the compound resulting from the mixture of these elements with  Buddhism was re-exported to the north and to China.    I shall discuss below the grounds for believing that Buddhism was  known in China before A.D. 62, the date when the Emperor Ming Ti is  said to have despatched a mission to enquire about it. For some time  many of its chief luminaries were immigrants from Central Asia and it  made its most rapid progress in that disturbed period of the third and  fourth centuries when North China was split up into contending Tartar  states which both in race and politics were closely connected with  Central Asia. Communication with India by land became frequent and  there was also communication _via_ the Malay Archipelago, especially  after the fifth century, when a double stream of Buddhist teachers  began to pour into China by sea as well as by land. A third tributary  joined them later when Khubilai, the Mongol conqueror of China, made  Lamaism, or Tibetan Buddhism, the state religion.    Tibetan Buddhism is a form of late Indian Mahayanism with a  considerable admixture of Hinduism, exported from Bengal to Tibet and  there modified not so much in doctrine as by the creation of a  powerful hierarchy, curiously analogous to the Roman Church. It is  unknown in southern China and not much favoured by the educated  classes in the north, but the Lamaist priesthood enjoys great  authority in Tibet and Mongolia, and both the Ming and Ching  dynasties did their best to conciliate it for political reasons.  Lamaism has borrowed little from China and must be regarded as an  invasion into northern Asia and even Europe[8] of late Indian religion  and art, somewhat modified by the strong idiosyncrasy of the Tibetan  people. This northern movement was started by the desire of imitation,  not of conquest. At the beginning of the seventh century the King  of Tibet, who had dealings with both India and China, sent a mission  to the former to enquire about Buddhism and in the eighth and eleventh  centuries eminent doctors were summoned from India to establish the  faith and then to restore it after a temporary eclipse.    In Korea, Annam, and especially in Japan, Buddhism has been a great  ethical, religious and artistic force and in this sense those  countries owe much to India. Yet there was little direct communication  and what they received came to them almost entirely through China. The  ancient Champa was a Hindu kingdom analogous to Camboja, but modern  Annam represents not a continuation of this civilization but a later  descent of Chinese culture from the north. Japan was in close touch  with the Chinese just at the period when Buddhism was fermenting their  whole intellectual life and Japanese thought and art grew up in the  glow of this new inspiration, which was more intense than in China  because there was no native antagonist of the same strength as  Confucianism.    In the following chapters I propose to discuss the history of Indian  influence in the various countries of Eastern Asia, taking Ceylon  first, followed by Burma and Siam. Whatever may have been the origin  of Buddhism in these two latter they have had for many centuries a  close ecclesiastical connection with Ceylon. Pali Buddhism prevails in  all, as well as in modern Camboja.    The Indian religion which prevailed in ancient Camboja was however of  a different type and similar to that of Champa and Java. In treating  of these Hindu kingdoms I have wondered whether I should not begin  with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1685"],[0,"The Mystery of the Yellow Room (#2)"],[1,"  of the furious attempts of Monsieur Stangerson and Bernier to burst  it open, was still holding firm; but at length, it gave way before our  united efforts,--and then what a sight met our eyes! I should tell you  that, behind us, the concierge held the laboratory lamp--a powerful  lamp, that lit the whole chamber.    \"'I must also tell you, monsieur, that The Yellow Room is a very small  room. Mademoiselle had furnished it with a fairly large iron bedstead,  a small table, a night-commode; a dressing-table, and two chairs. By  the light of the big lamp we saw all at a glance. Mademoiselle, in  her night-dress, was lying on the floor in the midst of the greatest  disorder. Tables and chairs had been overthrown, showing that there had  been a violent struggle. Mademoiselle had certainly been dragged  from her bed. She was covered with blood and had terrible marks of  finger-nails on her throat,--the flesh of her neck having been almost  torn by the nails. From a wound on the right temple a stream of  blood had run down and made a little pool on the floor. When Monsieur  Stangerson saw his daughter in that state, he threw himself on his knees  beside her, uttering a cry of despair. He ascertained that she still  breathed. As to us, we searched for the wretch who had tried to kill our  mistress, and I swear to you, monsieur, that, if we had found him, it  would have gone hard with him!    \"'But how to explain that he was not there, that he had already escaped?  It passes all imagination!--Nobody under the bed, nobody behind the  furniture!--All that we discovered were traces, blood-stained marks of  a man's large hand on the walls and on the door; a big handkerchief red  with blood, without any initials, an old cap, and many fresh footmarks  of a man on the floor,--footmarks of a man with large feet whose  boot-soles had left a sort of sooty impression. How had this man got  away? How had he vanished? Don't forget, monsieur, that there is no  chimney in The Yellow Room. He could not have escaped by the door, which  is narrow, and on the threshold of which the concierge stood with the  lamp, while her husband and I searched for him in every corner of the  little room, where it is impossible for anyone to hide himself. The  door, which had been forced open against the wall, could not conceal  anything behind it, as we assured ourselves. By the window, still in  every way secured, no flight had been possible. What then?--I began to  believe in the Devil.    \"'But we discovered my revolver on the floor!--Yes, my revolver! Oh!  that brought me back to the reality! The Devil would not have needed to  steal my revolver to kill Mademoiselle. The man who had been there had  first gone up to my attic and taken my revolver from the drawer where  I kept it. We then ascertained, by counting the cartridges, that the  assassin had fired two shots. Ah! it was fortunate for me that Monsieur  Stangerson was in the laboratory when the affair took place and had seen  with his own eyes that I was there with him; for otherwise, with this  business of my revolver, I don't know where we should have been,--I  should now be under lock and bar. Justice wants no more to send a man to  the scaffold!'\"    The editor of the \"Matin\" added to this interview the following lines:    \"We have, without interrupting him, allowed Daddy Jacques to recount  to us roughly all he knows about the crime of The Yellow Room. We have  reproduced it in his own words, only sparing the reader the continual  lamentations with which he garnished his narrative. It is quite  understood, Daddy Jacques, quite understood, that you are very fond of  your masters; and you want them to know it, and never cease repeating  it--especially since the discovery of your revolver. It is your right,  and we see no harm in it. We should have liked to put some further  questions to Daddy Jacques--Jacques--Louis Moustier--but the inquiry  of the examining magistrate, which is being carried on at the chateau,  makes it impossible for us to gain admission at the Glandier; and, as  to the oak wood, it is guarded by a wide circle of policemen, who are  jealously watching all traces that can lead to the pavilion, and that  may perhaps lead to the discovery of the assassin. \"We have also wished  to question the concierges, but they are invisible. Finally, we have  waited in a roadside inn, not far from the gate of the chateau, for  the departure of Monsieur de Marquet, the magistrate of Corbeil. At  half-past five we saw him and his clerk and, before he was able to enter  his carriage, had an opportunity to ask him the following question:    \"'Can you, Monsieur de Marquet, give us any information as to this  affair, without inconvenience to the course of your inquiry?'    \"'It is impossible for us to do it,' replied Monsieur de Marquet. 'I can  only say that it is the strangest affair I have ever known. The more we  think we know something, the further we are from knowing anything!'    \"We asked Monsieur de Marquet to be good enough to explain his last  words; and this is what he said,--the importance of which no one will  fail to recognise:    \"'If nothing is added to the material facts so far established, I  fear that the mystery which surrounds the abominable crime of which  Mademoiselle Stangerson has been the victim will never be brought to  light; but it is to be hoped, for the sake of our human reason, that  the examination of the walls, and of the ceiling of The Yellow  Room--an examination which I shall to-morrow intrust to the builder who  constructed the pavilion four years ago--will afford us the proof that  may not discourage us. For the problem is this: we know by what way the  assassin gained admission,--he entered by the door and hid himself under  the bed, awaiting Mademoiselle Stangerson. But how did he leave? How did  he escape? If no trap, no secret door, no hiding place, no opening  of any sort is found; if the examination of the walls--even to the  demolition of the pavilion--does not reveal any passage practicable--not  only for a human being, but for any being whatsoever--if the ceiling  shows no crack, if the floor hides no underground passage, one must  really believe in the Devil, as Daddy Jacques says!'\"    And the anonymous writer in the \"Matin\" added in this article--which I  have selected as the most interesting of all those that were published  on the subject of this affair--that the examining magistrate appeared  to place a peculiar significance to the last sentence: \"One must really  believe in the Devil, as Jacques says.\"    The article concluded with these lines: \"We wanted to know what Daddy  Jacques meant by the cry of the Bete Du Bon Dieu.\" The landlord of the  Donjon Inn explained to us that it is the particularly sinister cry  which is uttered sometimes at night by the cat of an old woman,--Mother  Angenoux, as she is called in the country. Mother Angenoux is a sort of  saint, who lives in a hut in the heart of the forest, not far from the  grotto of Sainte-Genevieve.    \"The Yellow Room, the Bete Du Bon Dieu, Mother Angenoux, the Devil,  Sainte-Genevieve, Daddy Jacques,--here is a well entangled crime which  the stroke of a pickaxe in the wall may disentangle for us to-morrow.  Let us at least hope that, for the sake of our human reason, as the  examining magistrate says. Meanwhile, it is expected that Mademoiselle  Stangerson--who has not ceased to be delirious and only pronounces  one word distinctly, 'Murderer! Murderer!'--will not live through the  night.\"    In conclusion, and at a late hour, the same journal announced that the  Chief of the Surete had telegraphed to the famous detective, Frederic  Larsan, who had been sent to London for an affair of stolen securities,  to return immediately to Paris.          CHAPTER II. In Which Joseph Rouletabille Appears for the First Time      I remember as well as if it had occurred yesterday, the entry of young  Rouletabille into my bedroom that morning. It was about eight o'clock  and I was still in bed reading the article in the \"Matin\" relative to  the Glandier crime.    But, before going further, it is time that I present my friend to the  reader.    I first knew Joseph Rouletabille when he was a young reporter. At that  time I was a beginner at the Bar and often met him in the corridors of  examining magistrates, when I had gone to get a \"permit to communicate\"  for the prison of Mazas, or for Saint-Lazare. He had, as they say, \"a  good nut.\" He seemed to have taken his head--round as a bullet--out of  a box of marbles, and it is from that, I think, that his comrades of  the press--all determined billiard-players--had given him that nickname,  which was to stick to him and be made illustrious by him. He was always  as red as a tomato, now gay as a lark, now grave as a judge. How, while  still so young--he was only sixteen and a half years old when I saw him  for the first time--had he already won his way on the press? That was  what everybody who came into contact with him might have asked, if they  had not known his history. At the time of the affair of the woman cut in  pieces in the Rue Oberskampf--another forgotten story--he had taken to  one of the editors of the \"Epoque,\"--a paper then rivalling the \"Matin\"  for information,--the left foot, which was missing from the basket  in which the gruesome remains were discovered. For this left foot the  police had been vainly searching for a week, and young Rouletabille had  found it in a drain where nobody had thought of looking for it. To  do that he had dressed himself as an extra sewer-man, one of a number  engaged by the administration of the city of Paris, owing to an overflow  of the Seine.    When the editor-in-chief was in possession of the precious foot and  informed as to the train of intelligent deductions the boy had been  led to make, he was divided between the admiration he felt for such  detective cunning in a brain of a lad of"]]]
