Through the Arbitrament of war, behold  a new and better America! a new and girded negro! \"The Watches of the  night have PASSED!\" \"The Watches Of the day BEGIN!\"    FOREWORD    He was a red headed messenger boy and he handed me a letter in a NILE  GREEN ENVELOPE, and this is what I read:    Dear Mr. Sweeney:    When on the 25th of March the last instalment of the MSS of the \"History  of the American Negro in the Great World War\" was returned to us from  your hands, bearing the stamp of your approval as to its historic  accuracy; the wisdom and fairness of the reflections and recommendations  of the corps of compilers placed at your service, giving you full  authority to review the result of their labors, your obligation to the  publishers ceased.    The transaction between us, a purely business one, had in every  particular upon your part been complied with. From thenceforward, as far  as you were obligated to the publishers, this History; what it is; what  it stands for; how it will be rated by the reading masses--should be,  and concretely, by your own people you so worthily represent and are  today their most fearless and eloquent champion, is, as far as any  obligation you may have been under to us, not required of you to say.    Nevertheless, regardless of past business relations now at an end, have  you not an opinion directly of the finished work? A word to say; the  growth of which you have marked from its first instalment to its last?    -The Publishers-           *       *       *       *       *    HAVE I--    A word to say? And of this fine book?    THE BEST HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN NEGRO IN THE GREAT WORLD WAR, THAT AS  YET HAS BEEN WRITTEN OR WILL BE FOR YEARS TO COME?           *       *       *       *       *    DOES--    The rose in bud respond to the wooing breath of the mornings of June?    IS--    The whistle of robin red breast clearer and more exultant, as its  watchful gaze, bearing in its inscrutable depths the mystery of all the  centuries; the Omniscience of DIVINITY, discovers a cherry tree bending  to--    \"The green grass\"    from the weight of its blood red fruit?           *       *       *       *       *    DOES--    The nightingale respond to its mate; caroling its amatory challenge from  afar; across brake and dale and glen; beyond a    \"Dim old forest\" the earth bathed in the silver light of the harvest  moon!           *       *       *       *       *    EVEN SO--    And for the same reason which the wisest of us cannot explain, that the  rose, the robin and nightingale respond to the lure that invites, the  zephyrs that caress, I find myself moved to say not only a word--a few,  but many, of praise and commendation of this book; the finished work, so  graciously and so quickly submitted for my inspection by the publishers.    THERE ARE--    Books and books; histories and histories, treatise after treatise;  covering every realm of speculative investigation; every field of fact  and fancy; of inspiration and deed, past and present, that in this 20th  century of haste and bustle, of miraculous mechanical equipment, are  born daily and die as quickly. But there are also books, that like some  men marked before their birth for a place amongst the \"Seats of the  MIGHTY\"; an association with the IMMORTALS, that         \"Were not born to die.\"    This book seems of that glorious company.           *       *       *       *       *    IN THE--    Spiritualized humanity that broadened the vision and inspired the pens  of the devoted corps of writers, responding to my suggestions and  oversight in its preparation; the getting together of data and facts, is  reflected the incoming of a NEW AND BROADER CHARITY--a stranger in our  midst--of glimpse and measurement of the Negro. Beyond the written word  of the text, the reader is gripped with a certain FELT but unprinted  power of suggestion, a sense of the nation's crime against him; the  Negro, stretching back through the centuries; the shame and humiliation  that is at last overtaking it, that has not been born of the \"Print  Shops\" since the sainted LINCOLN went his way, leaving behind him a  trail of glory, shining like the sun; in the path of which, freed  through the mandate of his great soul, MARCHED FOUR MILLION NEGROES, now  swollen to twelve, their story, the saddest epic of the ages, of whom  and in behalf of whom their children; the generation now and those to  come, this History was collated and arranged. It is an EVANGEL  proclaiming to the world, their unsullied patriotism; their rapid fire  loyalty, that through all the years of the nation's life, has never  flickered--         \"Has burned and burned Forever the same\",    from Lexington to the cactus groves of Mexico; in the slaughter hells of  Europe; over fields and upon spots where, in the centuries gone, the  legions of Caesar, of Hannibal and Attila, of Charlemagne and Napoleon  had fought and bled, and perished! Striding \"Breast forward\" beneath the  Stars and Stripes as this History crowds them on your gaze, through the  dust of empires and kingdoms that; before the CHRIST walked the earth;  before Christianity had its birth, wielded the sceptres of power when  civilization was young, but which are now but vanishing traditions.    You are thrilled! History nor story affords no picture more inspiring.    MAKING DUE ALLOWANCE--    For its nearness to the living and dead, whose heroic and transcendant  achievements on the battle spots of the great war secured for them a  distinction and fame that will endure until--         \"The records of valor decay\",    it is a most notable publication, quite worthy to be draped in the robes  that distinguishes History from narrative; from \"a tale that is told\"; a  story for the entertainment of the moment.    AS INTERPOLATED--    By the writers of its text; read between the lines of their written  words; it is a History; not alone of the American Negro on the \"tented  field\"; the bloody trenches of France and Belgium, it is also a History  and an arraignment, a warning and a prophecy, looking backwards and  forward, the Negro being the objective focus, of many things.    IT PRESENTS--    For the readers retrospection, as vividly as painted on a canvas, a  phantasmagoric procession of past events, and of those to come in the  travail of the Negro; commencing with the sailing of the first \"Slaver's  Ship\" for the shores of the \"New World\", jammed fore and aft, from deck  to hold, with its cargo of human beings, to the conclusion of the great  war in which,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1662"],[0,"The 1997 CIA World Factbook (#2)"],[1,"Committee, set up in 1954 to study the  structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in 1955  that: \"The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication  which provides the essential elements of basic intelligence on all  areas of the world. . . . There will always be a continuing  requirement for keeping the Survey up-to-date.\" The Factbook was  created as an annual summary and update to the encyclopedic NIS  studies. The first classified Factbook was published in August 1962,  and the first unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS  program was terminated except for the Factbook and gazetteers in 1973.  The 1975 Factbook was the first to be made available to the public  with sales through the US Government Printing Office (GPO). The 1996  edition was the first to be printed by GPO. The year 1997 marks the  50th anniversary of the establishment of the Central Intelligence  Agency and the 54th year of continuous basic intelligence support to  the US Government by The World Factbook and its two predecessor  programs.    ______________________________________________________________________    NOTES AND DEFINITIONS    There have been some significant changes in this edition. A schema or  Guide to Country Profiles has been added. The new maps and flags  accompanying each country profile are in color. The country name Zaire  has been officially changed to Democratic Republic of the Congo. Congo  is now referred to as Republic of the Congo. New reference maps of the  United States, Ethnolinguistic Groups in Afghanistan, and Central  Africa have been included. Introduction is a new category with two  entries--Current issues and Historical perspective that now appear in  only a few country profiles, but will be added to all countries in the  future. The Area--comparative entry was separated from the Area entry.  The lowest point and highest point information has been removed from  the Terrain entry and put into a new entry called Elevation extremes.  The former Environment entry has been replaced by three new  entries--Natural hazards, Environment--current issues, and  Environment--international agreements. US diplomatic representation  has been renamed Diplomatic representation from the US in order to  parallel the Diplomatic representation in the US entry. The former  Airports entry has been split into three separate entries--Airports,  Airports--with paved runways, and Airports--with unpaved runways. The  Defense category has been renamed Military. The Branches entry has  been renamed Military branches. The former Manpower availability entry  has been replaced by four new entries--Military manpower--military  age, Military manpower--availability, Military manpower--fit for  military service, and Military manpower--reaching military age  annually. The former Defense expenditures entry has been replaced by  two new entries--Military expenditures--dollar figure, and Military  expenditures--percent of GDP. Transnational Issues is a new category  that now includes only two existing entries (Illicit drugs and  Disputes--international) but additional entries will be considered in  the future.    Abbreviations: This information is included in Appendix A:  Abbreviations which includes all abbreviations and acronyms used in  the Factbook with their expansions.    Administrative divisions: This entry generally gives the numbers,  designatory terms, and first-order administrative divisions as  approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have  been reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.    Age structure: This entry provides the distribution of the population  according to age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14  years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over). The age structure of a  population will affect a country's investment pattern. Countries with  young populations (high percentage under age 15) need to invest more  in schools, while countries with older populations (high percentage  ages 65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector. The age  structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues.  For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to  find employment can lead to unrest.    Agriculture--products: This entry is a rank ordering of major crops  and products starting with the most important.    Airports: This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s)  may be paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt,  sand, or gravel surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have  facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control.    Airports--with paved runways: This entry gives the total number of  airports with paved runways (concrete or asphalt surfaces). For  airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is  included according to the following five groups--(1) over 3,047 m, (2)  2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5)  under 914 m. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,  maintenance, or air traffic control. Only airports with usable runways  are included in this listing.    Airports--with unpaved runways: This entry gives the total number of  airports with unpaved runways (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces).  For airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is  included according to the following five groups--(1) over 3,047 m, (2)  2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5)  under 914 m. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,  maintenance, or air traffic control. Only airports with usable runways  are included in this listing.    Appendixes: This section includes Factbook-related material by topic.  Area: This entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of  all land and water areas delimited by international boundaries and/or  coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by  international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding inland water  bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water area is the sum of all water  surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines,  including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).    Area--comparative: This entry provides an area comparison based on  total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US  or one of the 50 states based on area measurements (1990 revised)  provided by the US Bureau of the Census. The smaller entities are  compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The Mall in  Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).    Birth rate: This entry gives the average annual number of births  during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude  birth rate. The birth rate is usually the dominant factor in  determining the rate of population growth. It depends on both the  level of fertility and the age structure of the population.    Budget: This entry includes revenues, total expenditures, and capital  expenditures.    Climate: This entry includes a brief description of typical weather  regimes throughout the year.    Coastline: This entry gives the total length of the boundary between  the land area (including islands) and the sea.    Communications: This category deals with the means of exchanging  information and includes the radio, telephone, and television entries.    Communications--note: This entry includes miscellaneous communications  information of significance not included elsewhere.    Constitution: This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions,  and major amendments.    Country map: Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in  color. The maps were produced from the best information available at  the time of preparation. Names and/or boundaries may have changed  subsequently.    Country name: This entry includes all forms of the country's name  approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an  example): conventional long form (Italian Republic), conventional  short form (Italy), local long form (Repubblica Italiana), local short  form (Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy), as well as the abbreviation.  See the Terminology note regarding the use of the term \"country.\"    Currency: This entry identifies the local medium of exchange and its  basic subunit.    Current issues: This entry briefly characterizes major geographic,  social, political, and military developments in the past 12 months and  may include a statement about one or two key future trends. This entry  appears for only a few countries at the present time, but will be  added to all countries in the future.    Data code: This entry gives the official US Government digraph that  precisely identifies every land entity without overlap, duplication,  or omission. AF, for example, is the data code for Afghanistan. This  two-letter country code is a standardized geopolitical data element  promulgated in the Federal Information Processing Standards  Publication (FIPS) 10-4 by the National Institute of Standards and  Technology at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the  Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the US Department of  State. The data code is used to eliminate confusion and  incompatibility in the collection, processing, and dissemination of  area-specific data and is particularly useful for interchanging data  between databases. Appendix F cross-references various country codes  and Appendix G does the same thing for hydrographic codes. Data  codes-country: This information is presented in Appendix F:  Cross-Reference List of Country Data Codes which includes the US  Government approved Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS),  the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and Internet  country codes.    Data codes--hydrographic: This information is presented in Appendix G:  Cross-Reference List of Hydrographic Data Codes which includes the  International"]]]
