The fabled  women-warriors were said to have been seen in this notable voyage, and  hence the name of the river _Amazon_, a name which in Spanish and  Portuguese is in the plural. It was not until nearly one hundred years  after Orellana was in his grave that a voyage of discovery ascended the  river. In 1637 Pedro Teixeira started from Para with an expedition of  nearly two thousand (all but seventy of whom were natives), and with  varied experiences, by water and by land, the explorer in eight months  reached the city of Quito, where he was received with distinguished  honor. Two hundred years ago the result of this expedition was  published.    The Amazon was from that time, at rare intervals, the highway of Spanish  and Portuguese priests and friars, who thus went to their distant  charges among the Indians. In 1745 the French academician De la  Condamine descended from Quito to Para, and gave the most accurate idea  of the great valley which we had until the first quarter of this  century.    The narrow policy of Spain and Portugal was most unfruitful in its  results to South America. A jealous eye guarded that great region, of  which it can be so well said there are                    \"Realms unknown and blooming wilds,      And fruitful deserts, worlds of solitude,      Where the sun smiles and seasons teem in vain.\"    Now, the making known to the world of any portion of these \"fruitful  deserts\" is performing a service for the world. This Professor Orton  has done. His interesting and valuable volume hardly needs any  introduction or commendation, for its intrinsic merit will exact the  approbation of every reader. Scientific men, and tourists who seek for  new routes of travel, will appreciate it at once; and I trust that the  time is near at hand when our mercantile men, by the perusal of such a  work, will see how wide a field lies before them for future commercial  enterprise. This portion of the tropics abounds in natural resources  which only need the stimulus of capital to draw them forth to the light;  to create among the natives a desire for articles of civilization in  exchange for the crude productions of the forest; and to stimulate  emigration to a healthy region of perpetual summer.    It seems as if Providence were opening the way for a great change in the  Valley of the Amazon. That immense region drained by the great river is  as large as all the United States east of the States of California and  Oregon and the Territory of Washington, and yet it has been so secluded,  mainly by the old monopolistic policy of Portugal, that that vast space  has not a population equal to the single city of Rio de Janeiro or of  Brooklyn. Two million five hundred thousand square miles are drained by  the Amazon. Three fourths of Brazil, one half of Bolivia, two thirds of  Peru, three fourths of Ecuador, and a portion of Venezuela are watered  by this river. Riches, mineral and vegetable, of inexhaustible supply  have been here locked up for centuries. Brazil held the key, but it was  not until under the rule of their present constitutional monarch, Don  Pedro II., that the Brazilians awoke to the necessity of opening this  glorious region. Steamers were introduced in 1853, subsidized by the  government. But it is to a young Brazilian statesman, Sr. A.C. Tavares  Bastos, that belongs the credit of having agitated, in the press and in  the national parliament, the opening of the Amazon, until public  opinion, thus acted upon, produced the desired result. On another  occasion, in May, 1868, I gave several indices of a more enlightened  policy in Brazil, and stated that the opening of the Amazon, which  occurred on the 7th of September, 1867, and by which the great river is  free to the flags of all nations, from the Atlantic to Peru, and the  abrogation of the monopoly of the coast-trade from the Amazon to the Rio  Grande do Sul, whereby 4000 miles of Brazilian sea-coast are open to the  vessels of every country, can not fail not only to develop the resources  of Brazil, but will prove of great benefit to the bordering  Hispano-American republics and to the maritime nations of the earth. The  opening of the Amazon is the most significant indication that the leaven  of the narrow monopolistic Portuguese conservatism has at last worked  out. Portugal would not allow Humboldt to enter the Amazon Valley in  Brazil. The result of the new policy is beyond the most sanguine  expectation. The exports and imports for Para for October and November,  1867, were double those of 1866. This is but the beginning. Soon it will  be found that it is cheaper for Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and New Granada,  east of the Andes, to receive their goods from, and to export their  India-rubber, cinchona, etc., to the United States and Europe, _via_ the  great water highway which discharges into the Atlantic, than by the  long, circuitous route of Cape Horn or the trans-Isthmian route of  Panama.

(#2)"],[1,"who had presumed to shed a generous tear for the fate of Charles I. and  the earl of Stratford; and after the first ebullitions of their fury  were over, what was still more mortifying, the book seemed to sink  into oblivion. Mr. Millar told me that in a twelvemonth he sold only  forty-five copies of it. I scarcely, indeed head of one man in the three  kingdoms, considerable for rank or letters, that could endure the book.  I must only except the primate of England, Dr. Herring, and the primate  of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which seem two odd exceptions. These dignified  prelates separately sent me messages not to be discouraged.    I was, however, I confess, discouraged; and had not the war been at that  time breaking out between France and England, I had certainly retired  to some provincial town of the former kingdom, have changed my name, and  never more have returned to my native country. But as this scheme  was not now practicable, and the subsequent volume was considerably  advanced, I resolved to pick up courage and to persevere.    In this interval, I published, at London, my Natural History of  Religion, along with some other small pieces. Its public entry was  rather obscure, except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet against  it, with all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and scurrility,  which distinguish the Warburtonian school. This pamphlet gave me some  consolation for the otherwise indifferent reception of my performance.    In 1756, two years after the fall of the first volume, was published  the second volume of my history, containing the period from the death of  Charles I. till the revolution. This performance happened to give less  displeasure to the whigs, and was better received. It not only rose  itself, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother.    But though I had been taught by experience that the whig party were in  possession of bestowing all places, both in the state and in Literature,  I was so little inclined to yield to their senseless clamor, that in  above a hundred alterations, which further study, reading, or reflection  engaged me to make in the reigns of the two first Stuarts, I have made  all of them invariably to the tory side. It is ridiculous to consider  the English constitution before that period as a regular plan of  liberty.    In 1759, I published my history of the house of Tudor. The clamor  against this performance was almost equal to that against the history  of the two first Stuarts. The reign of Elizabeth was particularly  obnoxious. But I was now callous against the impressions of public  folly, and continued very peaceably and contentedly, in my retreat at  Edinburgh, to finish, in two volumes, the more early part of the English  history, which I gave to the public in 1761, with tolerable, and but  tolerable, success.    But, notwithstanding this variety of winds and seasons, to which my  writings had been exposed, they had still been making such advances,  that the copy-money given me by the booksellers much exceeded any  thing formerly known in England; I was become not only independent, but  opulent. I retired to my native country of Scotland, determined never  more to set my foot out of it; and retaining the satisfaction of never  having preferred a request to one great man, or even making advances of  friendship to any of them. As I was now turned of fifty, I thought of  passing all the rest of my life in this philosophical manner: when I  received, in 1763, an invitation from the earl of Hertford, with whom I  was not in the least acquainted, to attend him on his embassy to Paris,  with a near prospect of being appointed secretary to the embassy; and,  in the mean while, of performing the functions of that office. This  offer, however inviting, I at first declined; both because I was  reluctant to begin connections with the great, and because I was afraid  that the civilities and gay company of Paris would prove disagreeable  to a person of my age and humor; but on his lordship's repeating the  invitation, I accepted of it. I have every reason, both of pleasure and  interest; to think myself happy in my connections with that nobleman, as  well as afterwards with his brother, General Conway.    Those who have not seen the strange effects of modes, will never imagine  the reception I met with at Paris, from men and women of all ranks and  stations. The more I resiled from their excessive civilities, the more  I was loaded with them. There is, however, a real satisfaction in living  at Paris, from the great number of sensible, knowing, and polite company  with which that city abounds above all places in the universe. I thought  once of settling there for life.    I was appointed secretary to the embassy; and, in summer, 1765, Lord  Hertford left me, being appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland. I was  charge d'affaires till the arrival of the duke of Richmond, towards the  end of the year. In the beginning of 1766, I left Paris, and next summer  went to Edinburgh, with the same view as formerly, of burying myself in  a philosophical retreat. I returned to that place, not richer, but with  much more money, and a much larger income, by means of Lord Hertford's  friendship, than I left it; and I was desirous of trying what  superfluity could produce, as I had formerly made an experiment of a  competency. But in 1767, I received from Mr. Conway an invitation to be  under-secretary; and this invitation, both the character of the person,  and my connections with Lord Hertford, prevented me from declining. I  returned to Edinburgh in 1769, very opulent, (for I possessed a revenue  of one thousand pounds a year,) healthy, and though somewhat stricken  in years, with the prospect of enjoying long my ease, and of seeing the  increase of my reputation.    In spring, 1775, I was struck with a disorder in my bowels, which at  first gave me no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend it, become mortal  and incurable. I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution. I have suffered  very little pain from my disorder; and what is more strange, have,  notwithstanding the great decline of my person, never suffered a  moment's abatement of my spirits; insomuch, that were I to name a period  of my life which I should most choose to pass over again, I might be  tempted to point to this later period. I possess the same ardor as ever  in study, and the same gayety in company. I consider, besides, that a  man of sixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities;  and though I see many symptoms of my literary reputation's breaking out  at last with additional lustre, I know that I could have but few years  to enjoy it. It is difficult to be more detached from life than I am at  present.    To conclude historically with my own character: I am, or rather was,  (for that is the style I must now use in speaking of myself, which  imboldens me the more to speak my sentiments;) I was, I say, a man of  mild disposition, of command of temper, of an open, social, and cheerful  humor, capable of attachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and of  great moderation in all my passions. Even my love of literary fame,  my ruling passion, never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent  disappointments. My company was not unacceptable to the young and  careless, as well as to the studious and literary; and as I took a  particular pleasure in the company of modest women, I had no reason to  be displeased with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though  most men, anywise eminent, have found reason to complain of Calumny, I  never was touched, or even attacked, by her baleful tooth; and though  I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious  factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury.  My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my  character and conduct; not but that the zealots, we may well  suppose, would have been glad to invent and propagate any story to my  disadvantage, but they could never find any which they thought would  wear the face of probability. I cannot say there is no vanity in making  this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one;  and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained.        April 18, 1776.    LETTER FROM ADAM SMITH, LL. D. TO WILLLIAM STRAHAN, ESQ.    Kirkaldy, Fifeshire, Nov. 9, 1778.[**]    DEAR SIR,    It is with a real, though a very melancholy pleasure, that I sit down to  give you some account of the behavior of our late excellent friend, Mr.  Hume, during his last illness.    Though, in his own judgment, his disease was mortal and incurable, yet  he allowed himself to be prevailed upon, by the entreaty of his friends,  to try what might be the effects of a long journey. A few days before he  set out, he wrote that account of his own life, which, together with  his other papers, he has left to your care. My account, therefore, shall  begin where his ends.    He set out for London towards the end of April, and at Morpeth met with  Mr. John Home and myself, who had both come down from London on purpose  to see him, expecting to have found him at Edinburgh. Mr. Home returned  with him, and attended him during the whole of his stay in England,  with that care and attention which might be expected from a temper so  perfectly friendly and affectionate. As I had written to my mother that  she might expect me in Scotland, I was under the necessity of continuing  my journey. His disease seemed to yield to exercise and change of air;  and when he arrived in London, he was apparently in much better health  than when he left Edinburgh. He was advised to go to Bath to drink the  waters, which appeared for some time to have so good an effect upon him,  that even he himself began to entertain, what he was not apt to do, a  better opinion of his own health. His symptoms, however, soon returned  with their usual violence; and from that moment "]]]
