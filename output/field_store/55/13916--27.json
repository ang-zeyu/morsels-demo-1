The English language is so complex in character that it can scarcely be  learned by rule, and can best be mastered by the study of such idioms and  phrases as are provided in this book; but just as care must be taken to  place every accent or stress on the proper syllable in the pronouncing of  every word it contains, so must the stress or emphasis be placed on the  proper word in every sentence spoken. To read or speak pleasingly one  should resort to constant practise by doing so aloud in private, or  preferably, in the presence of such persons as know good reading when they  hear it and are masters of the melody of sounds. It was Dean Swift's  belief that the common fluency of speech in many men and most women was  due to scarcity of matter and scarcity of words. He claimed that a master  of language possessed a mind full of ideas, and that before speaking, such  a mind paused to select the choice word--the phrase best suited to the  occasion. \"Common speakers,\" he said, \"have only one set of ideas, and one  set of words to clothe them in,\" and these are always ready on the lips.  Because he holds the Dean's view sound to-day, the writer will venture to  warn the readers of this book against a habit that, growing far too common  among us, should be checked, and this is the iteration and reiteration in  conversation of \"the battered, stale, and trite\" phrases, the like of  which were credited by the worthy Dean to the women   of his time.    Human thought elaborates itself with the progress of intelligence. Speech  is the harvest of thought, and the relation which exists between words and  the mouths that speak them must be carefully observed. Just as nothing is  more beautiful than a word fitly spoken, so nothing is rarer than the use  of a word in its exact meaning. There is a tendency to overwork both words  and phrases that is not restricted to any particular class. The learned  sin in this respect even as do the ignorant, and the practise spreads  until it becomes an epidemic. The epidemic word with us yesterday was  unquestionably \"conscription\"; several months ago it was \"preparedness.\"  Before then \"efficiency\" was heard on every side and succeeded in  superseding \"vocational teaching,\" only to be displaced in turn by \"life  extension\" activities. \"Safety-first\" had a long run which was brought  almost to abrupt end by \"strict accountability,\" but these are mere  reflections of our cosmopolitan life and activities. There are others that  stand out as indicators of brain-weariness. These are most frequently met  in the work of our novelists.    English authors and journalists are abusing and overworking the word  intrigue to-day. Sir Arthur Quillercouch on page 81 of his book \"On the  Art of Writing\" uses it: \"We are intrigued by the process of manufacture  instead of being wearied by a description of the ready-made article.\" Mrs.  Sidgwick in \"Salt and Savour,\" page 232, wrote: \"But what intrigued her  was Little Mamma's remark at breakfast,\" From the Parliamentary news, one  learns that \"Mr. Harcourt intrigued the House of Commons by his sustained  silence for two years\" and that \"London is interested in, and not a little  intrigued, by the statement.\" This use of intrigue in the sense of  \"perplex, puzzle, trick, or deceive\" dates from 1600. Then it fell into a  state of somnolence, and after an existence of innocuous desuetude lasting  till 1794 it was revived, only to hibernate again until 1894. It owes its  new lease of life to a writer on The Westminster Gazette, a London journal  famous for its competitions in aid of the restoring of the dead meanings  of words.    One is almost exasperated by the repeated use and abuse of the word  \"intimate\" in a recently published work of fiction, by an author who  aspires to the first rank in his profession. He writes of \"the intimate  dimness of the room;\" \"a fierce intimate whispering;\" \"a look that was  intimate;\" \"the noise of the city was intimate,\" etc. Who has not heard,  \"The idea!\" \"What's the idea?\" \"Is that the idea?\" \"Yes, that's the idea,\"  with increased inflection at each repetition. And who is without a friend  who at some time or another has not sprung \"meticulous\" upon him? Another  example is afforded by the endemic use of \"of sorts\" which struck London  while the writer was in that city a few years ago. Whence it came no one  knew, but it was heard on every side. \"She was a woman of sorts;\" \"he is a  Tory of sorts;\" \"he had a religion of sorts;\" \"he was a critic of sorts.\"  While it originally meant \"of different or various kinds,\" as hats of  sorts; offices of sorts; cheeses of sorts, etc., it is now used  disparagingly, and implies something of a kind that is not satisfactory,  or of a character that is rather poor. This, as Shakespeare might have  said, is \"Sodden business! There's a stewed phrase indeed!\" [Footnote:  Troilus and Cressida, act iii, sc. 1.]    The abuse of phrases and the misuse of words rife among us can be checked  by diligent exercises in good English, such as this book provides. These  exercises, in conjunction with others to be found in different volumes by  the same author, will serve to correct careless diction and slovenly  speech, and lead to the art of speaking and writing correctly; for, after  all, accuracy in the use of words is more a matter of habit than of  theory, and once it is acquired it becomes just as easy to speak or to  write good English as bad English. It was Chesterfield's resolution not to  speak a word in conversation which was not the fittest he could recall.  All persons should avoid using words whose meanings they do not know, and  with the correct application of which they are unfamiliar. The best spoken  and the best written English is that which conforms to the language as  used by men and women of culture--a high standard, it is true, but one not  so high that it is unattainable by any earnest student of the English  tongue.  FRANK H. VIZETELLY.        HOW TO USE THIS BOOK    The study of words, phrases, and literary expressions is a highly  interesting pursuit. There is a reciprocal influence between thought and  language. What we think molds the words we use, and the words we use react  upon our thoughts. Hence a study of words is a study of ideas, and a  stimulant to deep and original thinking.    We should not, however, study \"sparkling words and sonorous phrases\" with  the object of introducing them consciously into our speech. To do so would  inevitably lead to stiltedness and superficiality. Words and phrases  should be studied as symbols of ideas, and as we become thoroughly  familiar with them they will play an unconscious but effective part in our  daily expression.    We acquire our vocabulary largely from our reading and our personal  associates. The words we use are an unmistakable indication of our thought  habits, tastes, ideals, and interests in life. In like manner, the  habitual language of a people is a barometer of their intellectual, civil,  moral, and spiritual ideals. A great and noble people express themselves  in great and noble words.    Ruskin earnestly counsels us to form the habit of looking intensely at  words. We should scrutinize them closely and endeavor to grasp their  innermost meaning. There is an indefinable satisfaction in knowing how to  choose and use words with accuracy and precision. As Fox once said, \"I am  never at a loss for a word, but Pitt always has the word.\"    All the great writers and orators have been diligent students of words.  Demosthenes and Cicero were indefatigable in their study of language.  Shakespeare, \"infinite in faculty,\" took infinite pains to embody his  thought in words of crystal clearness. Coleridge once said of him that  one might as well try to dislodge a brick from a building with one's  forefinger as to omit a single word from one of his finest passages.    Milton, master of majestic prose, under whose touch words became as living  things; Flaubert, who believed there was one and one only best word with  which to express a given thought; De Quincey, who exercised a weird-like  power over words; Ruskin, whose rhythmic prose enchanted the ear; Keats,  who brooded over phrases like a lover; Newman, of pure and melodious  style; Stevenson, forever in quest of the scrupulously precise word;  Tennyson, graceful and exquisite as the limpid stream; Emerson, of  trenchant and epigrammatic style; Webster, whose virile words sometimes  weighed a pound; and Lincoln, of simple, Saxon speech,--all these  illustrious men were assiduous in their study of words.    Many persons of good education unconsciously circumscribe themselves  within a small vocabulary. They have a knowledge of hundreds of desirable  words which they do not put into practical use in their speech or writing.  Many, too, are conscious of a poverty of language, which engenders in them  a sense of timidity and self-depreciation. The method used for building a  large vocabulary has usually been confined to the study of single words.  This has produced good results, but it is believed that eminently better  results can be obtained from a careful study of words and expressions, as  furnished in this book, where words can be examined in their context.    It is intended and suggested that this study should be pursued in  connection with, and as a supplement to, a good standard dictionary.  Fifteen minutes a day devoted to this subject, in the manner outlined,  will do more to improve and enlarge the vocabulary than an hour spent in  desultory reading.    There is no better way in which to develop the mental qualities of  clearness, accuracy, and precision, and to improve and enlarge the  intellectual powers generally, than by regular and painstaking study of  judiciously selected phrases and literary expressions.

Every day we hear people asking one  another if it is true that we shall soon be able to communicate with  some of the far-off globes, such as Mars, that circle in company with  our earth about the sun. One of the masters of practical electrical  science in our time has suggested that the principle of wireless  telegraphy may be extended to the transmission of messages across space  from planet to planet. The existence of intelligent inhabitants in some  of the other planets has become, with many, a matter of conviction, and  for everybody it presents a question of fascinating interest, which has  deeply stirred the popular imagination.    The importance of this subject as an intellectual phenomenon of the  opening century is clearly indicated by the extent to which it has  entered into recent literature. Poets feel its inspiration, and  novelists and romancers freely select other planets as the scenes of  their stories. One tells us of a visit paid by men to the moon, and of  the wonderful things seen, and adventures had, there. Lucian, it is  true, did the same thing eighteen hundred years ago, but he had not the  aid of hints from modern science to guide his speculations and lend  verisimilitude to his narrative.    Another startles us from our sense of planetary security with a  realistic account of the invasion of the earth by the terrible sons of  warlike Mars, seeking to extend their empire by the conquest of foreign  globes.    Sometimes it is a trip from world to world, a kind of celestial pleasure  yachting, with depictions of creatures more wonderful than--        \"The anthropophagi and men whose heads      Do grow beneath their shoulders\"--    that is presented to our imagination; and sometimes we are informed of  the visions beheld by the temporarily disembodied spirits of trance  mediums, or other modern thaumaturgists, flitting about among the  planets.    Then, to vary the theme, we find charming inhabitants of other worlds  represented as coming down to the earth and sojourning for a time on our  dull planet, to the delight of susceptible successors of father Adam,  who become, henceforth, ready to follow their captivating visitors to  the ends of the universe.    In short, writers of fiction have already established interplanetary  communication to their entire satisfaction, thus vastly and indefinitely  enlarging the bounds of romance, and making us so familiar with the  peculiarities of our remarkable brothers and sisters of Mars, Venus,  and the moon, that we can not help feeling, notwithstanding the many  divergences in the descriptions, that we should certainly recognize them  on sight wherever we might meet them.    But the subject is by no means abandoned to the tellers of tales and the  dreamers of dreams. Men of science, also, eagerly enter into the  discussion of the possibilities of other worlds, and become warm over  it.    Around Mars, in particular, a lively war of opinions rages. Not all  astronomers have joined in the dispute--some have not imagination  enough, and some are waiting for more light before choosing sides--but  those who have entered the arena are divided between two opposed camps.  One side holds that Mars is not only a world capable of having  inhabitants, but that it actually has them, and that they have given  visual proof of their existence and their intelligence through the  changes they have produced upon its surface. The other side maintains  that Mars is neither inhabited nor habitable, and that what are taken  for vast public works and engineering marvels wrought by its  industrious inhabitants, are nothing but illusions of the telescope, or  delusions of the observer's mind. Both adduce numerous observations,  telescopic and spectroscopic, and many arguments, scientific and  theoretic, to support their respective contentions, but neither side has  yet been able to convince or silence the other, although both have made  themselves and their views intensely interesting to the world at large,  which would very much like to know what the truth really is.    And not only Mars, but Venus--the beauteous twin sister of the earth,  who, when she glows in the evening sky, makes everybody a lover of the  stars--and even Mercury, the Moor among the planets, wearing \"the  shadowed livery of the burnished sun,\" to whom he is \"a neighbor and  near bred,\" and Jupiter, Saturn, and the moon itself--all these have  their advocates, who refuse to believe that they are lifeless globes,  mere reflectors of useless sunshine.    The case of the moon is, in this respect, especially interesting, on  account of the change that has occurred in the opinions held concerning  its physical condition. For a very long time our satellite was  confidently, and almost universally, regarded as an airless, waterless,  lifeless desert, a completely \"dead world,\" a bare, desiccated skull of  rock, circling about the living earth.    But within a few years there has been a reaction from this extreme view  of the lifelessness of the moon. Observers tell us of clouds suddenly  appearing and then melting to invisibility over volcanic craters; of  evidences of an atmosphere, rare as compared with ours, yet manifest in  its effects; of variations of color witnessed in certain places as the  sunlight drifts over them at changing angles of incidence; of what seem  to be immense fields of vegetation covering level ground, and of  appearances indicating the existence of clouds of ice crystals and  deposits of snow among the mountainous lunar landscapes. Thus, in a  manner, the moon is rehabilitated, and we are invited to regard its  silvery beams not as the reflections of the surface of a desert, but as  sent back to our eyes from the face of a world that yet has some slight  remnants of life to brighten it.    The suggestion that there is an atmosphere lying close upon the shell of  the lunar globe, filling the deep cavities that pit its face "]]]
