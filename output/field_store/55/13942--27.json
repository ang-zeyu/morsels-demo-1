The  Parisian eats a score of little birds we are too proud to mention in our  cookery books, and he knows the difference between a _mauviette_ and an  _alouette_. Perhaps the greatest abasement of the Briton, whose  ancestors called the French \"Froggies\" in scorn, comes when his first  morning in Paris he orders for breakfast with joyful expectation a dish  of the thighs of the little frogs from the vineyards. An Austrian  pastry-cook has a lighter hand than a French one, but the Parisian open  tarts and cakes and the _friandises_ and the ice, or _coupe-jacque_ at  the end of the Gallic repast are excellent.    Paris is strewn with the wrecks of restaurants, and many of the  establishments with great names of our grandfathers' and fathers' days  are now only _tavernes_ or cheap _table-d'hote_ restaurants. The Grand  Vefour in the Palais Royal--where the patrons of the establishment in  Louis Philippe's time used to eat off royal crockery, bought from the  surplus stock of the palaces by M. Hamel, cook to the king, and  proprietor of the restaurant--has lost its vogue in the world of  fashion. The present Cafe de Paris has an excellent cook, and is the  supper restaurant where the most shimmering lights of the _demi-monde_  may be seen; but the old Cafe de Paris, at the corner of the Rue  Taitbout, the house which M. Martin Guepet brought to such fame, and  where the _Veau a la Casserole_ drew the warmest praise from our  grandfathers, has vanished. Bignon's, which was a name known throughout  the world, has fallen from its high estate; the Cafe Riche, though it  retains a good restaurant, is not the old famous dining-place any  longer; and the Marivaux, where Joseph flourished, has been transformed  into a _brasserie_. The Cafe Hardi, at one time a very celebrated  restaurant, made place for the Maison d'Or, and the gilded glory of the  latter has now passed in its turn. The Cafe Veron, Philippe's, of the  Rue Mont Orgueil, and the Rocher de Cancale in the Rue Mandar, where  Borel, one of the cooks of Napoleon I., made gastronomic history,  Beauvilliers's, the proprietor of which was a friend of all the  field-marshals of Europe, and made and lost half-a-dozen fortunes, the  Trois Freres Provenceaux, the Cafe Very, and D'Hortesio's are but  memories.    The saddest disappearance of all, because the latest, is the Maison  d'Or, which is to be converted, so it is said, into a _brasserie_. The  retirement of Casimir, one of the Verdier family, who was to the D'Or  what Duglere was to the Anglais, precipitated the catastrophe, and in  the autumn of 1902 the house gave its farewell luncheon, and closed with  all the honours of war. Alas for the _Carpe a la Gelee_ and the _Sole au  vin Rouge_ and the _Poularde Maison d'Or_! I shall never, I fear, eat  their like again. There was much history attached to the little golden  house; more, perhaps, than to any other restaurant in the world. From  its doors Rigolboche, in the costume of Mother Eve, started for her run  across the road to the Anglais. At the table by one of the windows  looking out on to the boulevard Nestor Roqueplan, Fould, Salamanca, and  Delahante used always to dine. Upstairs in \"Le Grand 6,\" which was to  the Maison d'Or what \"Le Grand 16\" is to the Anglais, Salamanca, who  drew a vast revenue from a Spanish banking-house, used to give  extraordinary suppers at which the lights of the _demi-monde_ of that  day, Cora Pearl, Anna Deslions, Deveria, and others used to be present.  The amusement of the Spaniard used to be to spill the wax from a candle  over the dresses, and then to pay royally for the damage. One evening he  asked one of the MM. Verdier whether a very big bill would be presented  to him if he burned the whole house down, and on being told that it was  only a matter of two or three million francs he would have set light to  the curtains if M. Verdier had not interfered to prevent him. The \"beau  Demidoff,\" the duelling Baron Espeleta, Princes Galitzin and Murat,  Tolstoy, and the Duc de Rivoli gave their parties in the \"Grand 6\"; and  down the narrow, steep flight of steps which led into the side street  the Duke of Hamilton fell and broke his neck. The Maison d'Or was the  meeting-place, in the sixty odd years of its existence, of many  celebrities of literature. Dumas, Meilhac, Emmanuel Arene used to dine  there before they went across the road for a game of cards at the Cercle  des Deux Mondes, and later Oncle Sarcey was one of the _habitues_ of the  house.    Two restaurants in particular seem to me to head the list of the  classic, quiet establishments, proud of having a long history, satisfied  with their usual _clientele_, non-advertising, content to rest on their  laurels. Those two are the Anglais and Voisin's, the former on the  Boulevard des Italiens, the latter in the Rue St-Honore. The Cafe  Anglais, the white-faced house at the corner of the Rue Marivaux, is the  senior of the two, for it has a history of more than a hundred years. It  was originally a little wine-merchant's shop, with its door leading into  the Rue Marivaux, and was owned by a M. Chevereuil. The ownerships of  MM. Chellet and de L'Homme marked successive steps in its upward career,  and when the restaurant came into the market in '79 or '80 it was bought  by a syndicate of bankers and other rich business men who parted with it  to its present proprietor. The Comte de Grammont Caderousse and his  companions in what used to be known as the \"Loge Infernale\" at the old  Opera, were the best-known patrons of the Anglais; and until the Opera  House, replaced by the present building, was burnt down, the Anglais was  a great supping-place, the little rabbit-hutches of the _entresol_  being the scene of some of the wildest and most interesting parties  given by the great men of the Second Empire. The history of the Anglais  has never been written because, as the proprietor will tell you, it  never _could_ be written without telling tales anent great men which  should not be put into print; but if you ask to see the book of menus,  chiefly of dinners given in the \"Grand Seize,\" the room on the first  floor, the curve of the windows of which look up the long line of the  boulevards, and if you are shown the treasure you will find in it  records of dinners given by King Edward when he was Prince of Wales, by  the Duc de Morny and by D'Orsay, by all the Grand Dukes who ever came  out of Russia, by \"Citron\" and Le Roi Milan, by the lights of the French  jockey club, and many other celebrities. There is one especially  interesting menu of a dinner at which Bismarck was a guest--before the  terrible year of course. While I am gossiping as to the curiosities of  the Anglais I must not forget a little collection of glass and silver in  a cabinet in the passage of the _entresol_. Every piece has a history,  and most of them have had royal owners. The great sight of the  restaurant, however, is its cellars. Electric light is used to light  them, luminous grapes hang from the arches, and an orange tree at the  end of a vista glows with transparent fruit. In these cellars, beside  the wine on the wine-list of the restaurant, are to be found some  bottles of all the great vintage years of claret, an object-lesson in  Bordeaux; and there are little stores of brandies of wondrous age, most  of which were already in the cellars when the battle of Waterloo was  fought.    From a gourmet's point of view the great interest in the restaurant will  lie, if he wishes to give a large dinner, in the Grand Seize or one of  the other private rooms; if he is going to dine alone, or is going to  take his wife out to dinner, in the triangular room on the ground floor  with its curtains of lace, its white walls, its mirrors and its little  gilt tripod in the centre of the floor. Duglere was the _chef_ who,  above all others, made history at the Anglais, and the present  proprietor, M. Burdel, was one of his pupils; and therefore the cookery  of Duglere is the cookery still of the Anglais. _Potage Germiny_ is  claimed by the Cafe Anglais as a dish invented by the house, but the  Maison d'Or across the way also laid claim to it, and told an anecdote  of its creation--how it was invented by Casimir for the Marquis de  St-George. The various fish _a la Duglere_ there can be no question  concerning, the _Barbue Duglere_ being the most celebrated; and the  _Poularde Albufera_ and the _Filet de Sole Mornay_ (which was also  claimed by the Grand Vefour) are both specialities of the house. You can  order as expensive a dinner as you will for a great feast at the  Anglais, and you can eat rich dishes if you desire it; but there is no  reason that you should not dine there very well, and as cheaply as you  can expect to get good material, good cooking, and good attendance  anywhere in the world. The \"dishes of the day\" are always excellent,  and I have dined off a plate of soup, a pint of Bordeaux, and some  slices of a _gigot de sept heures_--one of the greatest achievements of  cookery--for a very few francs. I always find that I can dine amply, and  on food that even a German doctor could not object to, for less than a  louis. For instance, a dinner at the Anglais of half-a-dozen Ostende  Oysters, _Potage Laitues et Quenelles_, _Merlans Frits_, _Cuisse de  Poularde de Rotie_, _Salade Romaine_, cheese, half a bottle of Graves  1e Cru, and a bottle of St-Galmier costs 18 francs.    Voisin's, in the Rue St-Honore, the corner house whose windows,  curtained with lace, promise dignified quiet, is a restaurant which has  a history, and has, and has had, great names amongst its _habitues_.  Many of these have been diplomats, and Voisin's knows that ambassadors  do not care to have their doings, when free from the cares of office,  gossiped about. When I first saw Voisin's, it looked as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18857"],[0,"A Journey to the Centre of the Earth (#2)"],[1,"and correct  account of the Norwegian princes who reigned in Iceland.\"    My next question related to the language in which it was written. I  hoped at all events it was translated into German. My uncle was  indignant at the very thought, and declared he wouldn't give a penny for  a translation. His delight was to have found the original work in the  Icelandic tongue, which he declared to be one of the most magnificent  and yet simple idioms in the world--while at the same time its  grammatical combinations were the most varied known to students.    \"About as easy as German?\" was my insidious remark.    My uncle shrugged his shoulders.    \"The letters at all events,\" I said, \"are rather difficult of  comprehension.\"    \"It is a Runic manuscript, the language of the original population of  Iceland, invented by Odin himself,\" cried my uncle, angry at my  ignorance.    I was about to venture upon some misplaced joke on the subject, when a  small scrap of parchment fell out of the leaves. Like a hungry man  snatching at a morsel of bread the Professor seized it. It was about  five inches by three and was scrawled over in the most extraordinary  fashion.    The lines shown here are an exact facsimile of what was written on the  venerable piece of parchment--and have wonderful importance, as they  induced my uncle to undertake the most wonderful series of adventures  which ever fell to the lot of human beings.    My uncle looked keenly at the document for some moments and then  declared that it was Runic. The letters were similar to those in the  book, but then what did they mean? This was exactly what I wanted to  know.    Now as I had a strong conviction that the Runic alphabet and dialect  were simply an invention to mystify poor human nature, I was delighted  to find that my uncle knew as much about the matter as I did--which was  nothing. At all events the tremulous motion of his fingers made me think  so.    \"And yet,\" he muttered to himself, \"it is old Icelandic, I am sure of  it.\"    And my uncle ought to have known, for he was a perfect polyglot  dictionary in himself. He did not pretend, like a certain learned  pundit, to speak the two thousand languages and four thousand idioms  made use of in different parts of the globe, but he did know all the  more important ones.    It is a matter of great doubt to me now, to what violent measures my  uncle's impetuosity might have led him, had not the clock struck two,  and our old French cook called out to let us know that dinner was on the  table.    \"Bother the dinner!\" cried my uncle.    But as I was hungry, I sallied forth to the dining room, where I took up  my usual quarters. Out of politeness I waited three minutes, but no sign  of my uncle, the Professor. I was surprised. He was not usually so blind  to the pleasure of a good dinner. It was the acme of German  luxury--parsley soup, a ham omelette with sorrel trimmings, an oyster of  veal stewed with prunes, delicious fruit, and sparkling Moselle. For the  sake of poring over this musty old piece of parchment, my uncle forbore  to share our meal. To satisfy my conscience, I ate for both.    The old cook and housekeeper was nearly out of her mind. After taking so  much trouble, to find her master not appear at dinner was to her a sad  disappointment--which, as she occasionally watched the havoc I was  making on the viands, became also alarm. If my uncle were to come to  table after all?    Suddenly, just as I had consumed the last apple and drunk the last glass  of wine, a terrible voice was heard at no great distance. It was my  uncle roaring for me to come to him. I made very nearly one leap of  it--so loud, so fierce was his tone.          CHAPTER 2    THE MYSTERIOUS PARCHMENT      [Illustration: Runic Glyphs]    \"I Declare,\" cried my uncle, striking the table fiercely with his fist,  \"I declare to you it is Runic--and contains some wonderful secret, which  I must get at, at any price.\"    I was about to reply when he stopped me.    \"Sit down,\" he said, quite fiercely, \"and write to my dictation.\"    I obeyed.    \"I will substitute,\" he said, \"a letter of our alphabet for that of the  Runic: we will then see what that will produce. Now, begin and make no  mistakes.\"    The dictation commenced with the following incomprehensible result:           mm.rnlls esruel seecJde       sgtssmf unteief niedrke       kt,samn atrateS Saodrrn       emtnaeI nuaect  rrilSa       Atvaar  .nscrc  ieaabs       ccdrmi  eeutul  frantu       dt,iac  oseibo  KediiY      Scarcely giving me time to finish, my uncle snatched the document from  my hands and examined it with the most rapt and deep attention.    \"I should like to know what it means,\" he said, after a long period.    I certainly could not tell him, nor did he expect me to--his  conversation being uniformly answered by himself.    \"I declare it puts me in mind of a cryptograph,\" he cried, \"unless,  indeed, the letters have been written without any real meaning; and yet  why take so much trouble? Who knows but I may be on the verge of some  great discovery?\"    My candid opinion was that it was all rubbish! But this opinion I kept  carefully to myself, as my uncle's choler was not pleasant to bear. All  this time he was comparing the book with the parchment.    \"The manuscript volume and the smaller document are written in different  hands,\" he said, \"the cryptograph is of much later date than the book;  there is an undoubted proof of the correctness of my surmise. [An  irrefragable proof I took it to be.] The first letter is a double M,  which was only added to the Icelandic language in the twelfth  century--this makes the parchment two hundred years posterior to the  volume.\"    The circumstances appeared very probable and very logical, but it was  all surmise to me.    \"To me it appears probable that this sentence was written by some owner  of the book. Now who was the owner, is the next important question.  Perhaps by great good luck it may be written somewhere in the volume.\"    With these words Professor Hardwigg took off his spectacles, and, taking  a powerful magnifying glass, examined the book carefully.    On the fly leaf was what appeared to be a blot of ink, but on  examination proved to be a line of writing almost effaced by time. This  was what he sought; and, after some considerable time, he made out these  letters:    [Illustration: Runic Glyphs]    \"Arne Saknussemm!\" he cried in a joyous and triumphant tone, \"that is  not only an Icelandic name, but of a learned professor of the sixteenth  century, a celebrated alchemist.\"    I bowed as a sign of respect.    \"These alchemists,\" he continued, \"Avicenna, Bacon, Lully, Paracelsus,  were the true, the only learned men of the day. They made surprising  discoveries. May not this Saknussemm, nephew mine, have hidden on this  bit of parchment some astounding invention? I believe the cryptograph to  have a profound meaning--which I must make out.\"    My uncle walked about the room in a state of excitement almost  impossible to describe.    \"It may be so, sir,\" I timidly observed, \"but why conceal it from  posterity, if it be a useful, a worthy discovery?\"    \"Why--how should I know? Did not Galileo make a secret of his  discoveries in connection with Saturn? But we shall see. Until I  discover the meaning of this sentence I will neither eat nor sleep.\"    \"My dear uncle--\" I began.    \"Nor you neither,\" he added.    It was lucky I had taken double allowance that day.    \"In the first place,\" he continued, \"there must be a clue to the  meaning. If we could find that, the rest would be easy enough.\"    I began seriously to reflect. The prospect of going without food and  sleep was not a promising one, so I determined to do my best to solve  the mystery. My uncle, meanwhile, went on with his soliloquy.    \"The way to discover it is easy enough. In this document there are one  hundred and thirty-two letters, giving seventy-nine consonants to  fifty-three vowels. This is about the proportion found in most southern  languages, the idioms of the north being much more rich in consonants.  We may confidently predict, therefore, that we have to deal with a  southern dialect.\"    Nothing could be more logical.    \"Now,\" said Professor Hardwigg, \"to trace the particular language.\"    \"As Shakespeare says, 'that is the question,\"' was my rather satirical  reply.    \"This man Saknussemm,\" he continued, \"was a very learned man: now as he  did not write in the language of his birthplace, he probably, like most  learned men of the sixteenth century, wrote in Latin. If, however, I  prove wrong in this guess, we must try Spanish, French, Italian, Greek,  and even Hebrew. My own opinion, though, is decidedly in favor of  Latin.\"    This proposition startled me. Latin was my favorite study, and it seemed  sacrilege to believe this gibberish to belong to the country of Virgil.    \"Barbarous Latin, in all probability,\" continued my uncle, \"but still  Latin.\"    \"Very probably,\" I replied, not to contradict him.    \"Let us see into the matter,\" continued my uncle; \"here you see we have  a series of one hundred and thirty-two letters, apparently thrown  pell-mell upon paper, without method or organization. There are words  which are composed wholly of consonants, such as <i>mm.rnlls</i>, others  which are nearly all vowels, the fifth, for instance, which is unteief,  and one of the last oseibo. This appears an extraordinary combination.  Probably we shall find that the phrase is arranged according to some  mathematical plan. No doubt a certain sentence has been written out and  then jumbled up--some plan to which some figure is the clue. Now, Harry,  to show your English wit--what is that figure?\"    I could give him no hint. My thoughts were indeed far away. While he was  speaking I had caught sight of the portrait of my cousin Gretchen, and  was wondering when she would return.    We were affianced, and loved one another very"]]]
