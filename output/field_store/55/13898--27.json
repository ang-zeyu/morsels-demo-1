The adult fly, upon emerging from the puparium, works its way upward  through the soil or manure and upon reaching the air it crawls about  while its wings expand and the body hardens and assumes its normal  coloration. In from 2 1/2 to 20 days, as previously stated, the female  is ready to deposit eggs. As in the case of other periods of its life  history, so the preoviposition period is prolonged considerably by the  lower temperatures of spring and fall. In midsummer, with a  developmental period of from 8 to 10 days from egg to adult, and a  preoviposition period of from 3 to 4 days, a new generation would be  started every 11 to 14 days. Thus the climate of the District of  Columbia allows abundance of time for the development of from 10 to 12  generations every season.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Pupae of the house fly. About natural size.  (Newstead.)]    Flies usually remain near their breeding places if they have plenty of  food, but experiments recently made at Dallas, Tex., show that they may  migrate considerable distances; in fact, house flies, so marked that the  particular individuals could be identified, have been recaptured in  traps as far as 13 miles from the place where they were liberated.          HOW THE HOUSE FLY PASSES THE WINTER.      The prevailing opinion that the house fly lives through the winter as an  adult, hiding in cracks and crevices of buildings, etc., appears to be  erroneous. Under outdoor conditions house flies are killed during the  first really cold nights, that is, when the temperature falls to about  15 deg. or 10 deg. F. In rooms and similar places protected from winds and  partially heated during the winter flies have been kept alive in cages  for long periods, but they never lived through the entire winter. In  longevity experiments one record of 70 days and another of 91 days was  obtained. No uncaged house flies were found during three seasons'  observations in unheated and only partially heated attics, stables,  unused rooms, etc., where favorable temperature conditions prevailed.  The common occurrence in such places of the cluster fly and a few other  species, which may be easily mistaken for the house fly, is responsible  for the prevailing belief as to the way the house fly overwinters. There  is therefore no reliable evidence whatever that adult house flies  emerging during October and November pass the winter and are able to  deposit their eggs the following spring, although they may continue  active in heated buildings until nearly the end of January. On the other  hand, there is evidence that house flies pass the winter as larvae and  pupae, and that they sometimes breed continuously throughout the winter.  In experiments at both Dallas, Tex., and Bethesda, Md., house flies have  been found emerging during April from heavily infested manure heaps  which had been set out and covered with cages during the preceding  autumn. In the Southern States, during warm periods in midwinter, house  flies may emerge and become somewhat troublesome; they frequently lay  eggs on warm days.    The second way in which the house fly may pass the winter is by  continuous breeding. House flies congregate in heated rooms with the  approach of the winter season. If no food or breeding materials are  present they eventually die. However, where they have access to both  food and suitable substances for egg laying they will continue breeding  just as they do outdoors during the summer. Even in very cold climates  there are undoubtedly many places, especially in cities, where house  flies would have opportunity to pass the winter in this manner.          CARRIAGE OF DISEASE BY THE HOUSE FLY.      The body of the house fly is covered thickly with hairs and bristles of  varying lengths, and this is especially true of the legs. Thus, when it  crawls over infected material it readily becomes loaded with germs, and  subsequent visits to human foods result in their contamination. Even  more dangerous than the transference of germs on the legs and body of  the fly is the fact that bacteria are found in greater numbers and live  longer in its alimentary canal. These germs are voided, not only in the  excrement of the fly, but also in small droplets of regurgitated matter  which have been called \"vomit spots.\" When we realize that flies  frequent and feed upon the most filthy substances (it may be the excreta  of typhoid or dysentery patients or the discharges of one suffering from  tuberculosis), and that subsequently they may contaminate human foods  with their feet or excreta or vomit spots, the necessity and importance  of house-fly control is clear.    In army camps, in mining camps, and in great public works, where large  numbers of men are brought together for a longer or shorter time, there  is seldom the proper care of excreta, and the carriage of typhoid germs  from the latrines and privies to food by flies is common and often  results in epidemics of typhoid fever.    And such carriage of typhoid is by no means confined to great temporary  camps. In farmhouses in small communities, and even in badly cared for  portions of large cities, typhoid germs are carried from excrement to  food by flies, and the proper supervision and treatment of the breeding  places of the house fly become most important elements in the prevention  of typhoid.    In the same way other intestinal germ diseases, such as Asiatic cholera,  dysentery, enteritis (inflammation of the intestine), and infantile  diarrhea, are all so carried. There is strong circumstantial evidence  also that tuberculosis, anthrax, yaws, ophthalmia, smallpox, tropical  sore, and the eggs of parasitic worms may be and are carried in this  way. In the case of over 30 different disease organisms and parasitic  worms, actual laboratory proof exists, and where lacking is replaced by  circumstantial evidence amounting almost to certainty.          EXCLUDING AND CAPTURING FLIES.      The principal effort to control this dangerous insect must be made at  the source of supply--its breeding places. Absolute cleanliness and the  removal or destruction of anything in which flies may breed are  essential; and this is something that can be done even in cities.  Perhaps it can be done more easily in the cities than in villages, on  account of their greater police power and the lesser insistence on the  rights of the individual. Once people are educated to the danger and  learn to find the breeding places, the rest will be easy.    In spite of what has just been said, it is often necessary to catch or  otherwise destroy adult flies, or to protect food materials from  contamination and persons from annoyance or danger; hence the value of  fly papers and poisons, flytraps, and insect screens.      THE USE OF INSECT SCREENS.    A careful screening of windows and doors during the summer months, with  the supplementary use of sticky fly papers, is a protective measure  against house flies known to everyone. As regards screening, it is only  necessary here to emphasize the importance of keeping food supplies  screened or otherwise covered so that flies can gain no access to them.  This applies not only to homes but also to stores, restaurants, milk  shops, and the like. Screening, of course, will have no effect in  decreasing the number of flies, but at least it has the virtue of  lessening the danger of contamination of food.    Insect screens for doors and windows should be well made and must fit  tightly, otherwise they will not keep insects out. It is equally  important that they be made of good and durable screen cloth. Copper  insect screen cloth, although a little higher in price, will prove more  economical in the long run, as it lasts many years. If, however, the  cost of copper screen cloth is objectionable, steel screen cloth, either  painted or galvanized, can be used. Painted steel screen cloth will last  one or more years without repainting, its durability depending upon the  climate. In humid regions, of course, it will rust more quickly than it  will where the climate is dry. The same may be said of galvanized steel  insect screen cloth.    Insect screen cloth made with 16 meshes to the inch is recommended, for  16-mesh screen cloth will keep out flies and most mosquitoes[9] and  other small insects which at times are found almost everywhere.    [Footnote 9: Where the yellow fever or dengue fever mosquito occurs,  18-mesh screen cloth (or 16-mesh screen cloth made from extra heavy  wire) should be used.]      FLY PAPERS AND POISONS.

(Bishopp.)]    The use of sticky fly papers to destroy flies that have gained access to  houses is well known. Fly-poison preparations also are common. Many of  the commercial fly poisons contain arsenic, and their use in the  household is attended with considerable danger, especially to children.  This danger is less with the use of a weak solution of formalin. A very  effective fly poison is made by adding 3 teaspoonfuls of the commercial  formalin to a pint of milk or water sweetened with a little brown sugar.  A convenient way of exposing this poison is by partly filling an  ordinary drinking glass with the solution. A saucer or plate is then  lined with white blotting paper cut the size of the dish and placed  bottom up over the glass.

He raises another  great army to oppose the allied powers, which is totally defeated at  Waterloo; he is a second time deposed, surrenders to the British, and  is placed in confinement at the island of St. Helena. Such is the  outline of the eventful history presented to us; in the detail of  which, however, there is almost every conceivable variety of  statement; while the motives and conduct of the chief actor are  involved in still greater doubt, and the subject of still more eager  controversy.           *       *       *       *       *    In the midst of these controversies, the preliminary question,  concerning the _existence_ of this extraordinary personage, seems  never to have occurred to any one as a matter of doubt; and to show  even the smallest hesitation in admitting it, would probably be  regarded as an excess of scepticism; on the ground that this point  has always been taken for granted by the disputants on all sides,  being indeed implied by the very nature of their disputes.    But is it in fact found that _undisputed_ points are always such as  have been the most carefully examined as to the evidence on which they  rest? that facts or principles which are taken for granted, without  controversy, as the common basis of opposite opinions, are always  themselves established on sufficient grounds? On the contrary, is not  any such fundamental point, from the very circumstance of its being  taken for granted at once, and the attention drawn off to some other  question, likely to be admitted on insufficient evidence, and the  flaws in that evidence overlooked?    Experience will teach us that such instances often occur: witness the  well-known anecdote of the Royal Society; to whom King Charles II.  proposed as a question, whence it is that a vessel of water receives  no addition of weight from a live fish being put into it, though it  does, if the fish be dead. Various solutions, of great ingenuity, were  proposed, discussed, objected to, and defended; nor was it till they  had been long bewildered in the inquiry, that it occurred to them _to  try the experiment_; by which they at once ascertained that the  phenomenon which they were striving to account for,--which was the  acknowledged basis and substratum, as it were, of their debates,--had  no existence but in the invention of the witty monarch.[3]    Another instance of the same kind is so very remarkable that I cannot  forbear mentioning it. It was objected to the system of Copernicus  when first brought forward, that if the earth turned on its axis, as  he represented, a stone dropped from the summit of a tower would not  fall at the foot of it, but at a great distance to the west; _in the  same manner as a stone dropped from the mast-head of a ship in full  sail, does not fall at the foot of the mast, but towards the stern_.  To this it was answered, that a stone being a _part_ of the earth  obeys the same laws, and moves with it; whereas, it is no part of the  ship; of which, consequently, its motion is independent. This solution  was admitted by some, but opposed by others; and the controversy went  on with spirit; nor was it till _one hundred years_ after the death of  Copernicus, that the experiment being tried, it was ascertained that  the stone thus dropped from the head of the mast _does_ fall at the  foot of it![4]    Let it be observed that I am not now impugning any one particular  narrative; but merely showing generally, that what is _unquestioned_  is not necessarily unquestionable; since men will often, at the very  moment when they are accurately sifting the evidence of some disputed  point, admit hastily, and on the most insufficient grounds, what they  have been accustomed to see taken for granted.    The celebrated Hume[5] has pointed out, also, the readiness with which  men believe, on very slight evidence, any story that pleases their  imagination by its admirable and marvellous character. Such hasty  credulity, however, as he well remarks, is utterly unworthy of a  philosophical mind; which should rather suspend its judgment the more,  in proportion to the strangeness of the account, and yield to none but  the most decisive and unimpeachable proofs.    Let it, then, be allowed us, as is surely reasonable, just to inquire,  with respect to the extraordinary story I have been speaking of, on  what evidence we believe it. We shall be told that it is _notorious_;  i.e., in plain English, it is very _much talked about_. But as the  generality of those who talk about Buonaparte do not even pretend to  speak from _their own authority_, but merely to repeat what they have  casually heard, we cannot reckon them as, in any degree, witnesses;  but must allow ninety-nine hundredths of what we are told to be mere  hearsay, which would not be at all the more worthy of credit even if  it were repeated by ten times as many more. As for those who profess  to have _personally known_ Napoleon Buonaparte, and to have  _themselves witnessed_ his transactions, I write not for them. _If any  such there be_, who are inwardly conscious of the truth of all they  relate, I have nothing to say to them, but to beg that they will be  tolerant and charitable towards their neighbours, who have not the  same means of ascertaining the truth, and who may well be excused for  remaining doubtful about such extraordinary events, till most  unanswerable proofs shall be adduced. \"I would not have believed such  a thing, if I had not seen it,\" is a common preface or appendix to a  narrative of marvels; and usually calls forth from an intelligent  hearer the appropriate answer, \"_no more will I_.\"    Let us, however, endeavour to trace up some of this hearsay evidence  as far towards its source as we are able. Most persons would refer to  the _newspapers_ as the authority from which their knowledge on the  subject was derived; so that, generally speaking, we may say it is on  the testimony of the newspapers that men believe in the existence and  exploits of Napoleon Buonaparte.    It is rather a remarkable circumstance, that it is common to hear  Englishmen speak of the impudent fabrications of foreign newspapers,  and express wonder that any one can be found to credit them; while  they conceive that, in this favoured land, the liberty of the press is  a sufficient security for veracity. It is true they often speak  contemptuously of such \"newspaper-stories\" as last but a short time;  indeed they continually see them contradicted within a day or two in  the same paper, or their falsity detected by some journal of an  opposite party; but still whatever is _long adhered to_ and often  _repeated_, especially if it also appear in _several different_  papers (and this, though they notoriously copy from one another), is  almost sure to be generally believed. Whence this high respect which  is practically paid to newspaper authority? Do men think, that because  a witness has been perpetually detected in falsehood, he may therefore  be the more safely believed whenever he is _not_ detected? or does  adherence to a story, and frequent repetition of it, render it the  more credible? On the contrary, is it not a common remark in other  cases, that a liar will generally stand to and reiterate what he has  once said, merely because he _has_ said it?    Let us, if possible, divest ourselves of this superstitious veneration  for everything that appears \"in print,\" and examine a little more  systematically the evidence which is adduced.           *       *       *       *       *    I suppose it will not be denied that the three following are among the  most important points to be ascertained, in deciding on the  credibility of witnesses; first, whether they have the means of  gaining correct _information_; secondly, whether they have any  _interest_ in concealing truth, or propagating falsehood; and,  thirdly, whether they _agree_ in their testimony. Let us examine the  present witnesses upon all these points.    First, what means have the editors of newspapers for giving correct  information? We know not, except from their own statements. Besides  what is copied from other journals, foreign or British, (which is  usually more than three-fourths of the news published,)[6] they  profess to refer to the authority of certain \"private correspondents\"  abroad; _who_ these correspondents are, what means they have of  obtaining information, or whether they exist at all, we have no way of  ascertaining. We find ourselves in the condition of the Hindoos, who  are told by their priests that the earth stands on an elephant, and  the elephant on a tortoise; but are left to find out for themselves  what the tortoise stands on, or whether it stands on anything at all.    So much for our clear knowledge of the means of _information_  possessed by these witnesses; next, for the grounds on which we are to  calculate on their _veracity_.    Have they not a manifest interest in circulating the wonderful  accounts of Napoleon Buonaparte and his achievements, whether true or  false? Few would read newspapers if they did not sometimes find  wonderful or important news in them; and we may safely say that no  subject was ever found so inexhaustibly interesting as the present.    It may be urged, however, that there are several adverse political  parties, of which the various public prints are respectively the  organs, and who would not fail to expose each other's fabrications.[7]  Doubtless they would, if they could do so without at the same time  exposing _their own_; but identity of interests may induce a  community of operations up to a certain point. And let it be observed  that the object of contention between these rival parties is, _who_  shall have the administration"]]]
