[Footnote 2: \"+technai epirretoi+,\" compare page 81.]      5. And then, the training of all these distinct classes will not be by  Universities of general knowledge, but by distinct schools of such  knowledge as shall be most useful for every class: in which, first the  principles of their special business may be perfectly taught, and  whatever higher learning, and cultivation of the faculties for receiving  and giving pleasure, may be properly joined with that labour, taught in  connection with it. Thus, I do not despair of seeing a School of  Agriculture, with its fully-endowed institutes of zoology, botany, and  chemistry; and a School of Mercantile Seamanship, with its institutes of  astronomy, meteorology, and natural history of the sea: and, to name  only one of the finer, I do not say higher, arts, we shall, I hope, in a  little time, have a perfect school of Metal-work, at the head of which  will be, not the ironmasters, but the goldsmiths: and therein, I  believe, that artists, being taught how to deal wisely with the most  precious of metals, will take into due government the uses of all  others.    But I must not permit myself to fail in the estimate of my immediate  duty, while I debate what that duty may hereafter become in the hands of  others; and I will therefore now, so far as I am able, lay before you a  brief general view of the existing state of the arts in England, and of  the influence which her Universities, through these newly-founded  lectureships, may, I hope, bring to bear upon it for good.      6. We have first to consider the impulse which has been given to the  practice of all the arts by the extension of our commerce, and enlarged  means of intercourse with foreign nations, by which we now become more  familiarly acquainted with their works in past and in present times. The  immediate result of these new opportunities, I regret to say, has been  to make us more jealous of the genius of others, than conscious of the  limitations of our own; and to make us rather desire to enlarge our  wealth by the sale of art, than to elevate our enjoyments by its  acquisition.    Now, whatever efforts we make, with a true desire to produce, and  possess, things that are intrinsically beautiful, have in them at least  one of the essential elements of success. But efforts having origin only  in the hope of enriching ourselves by the sale of our productions, are  _assuredly_ condemned to dishonourable failure; not because, ultimately,  a well-trained nation is forbidden to profit by the exercise of its  peculiar art-skill; but because that peculiar art-skill can never be  developed _with a view_ to profit. The right fulfilment of national  power in art depends always on THE DIRECTION OF ITS AIM BY THE  EXPERIENCE OF AGES. Self-knowledge is not less difficult, nor less  necessary for the direction of its genius, to a people than to an  individual; and it is neither to be acquired by the eagerness of  unpractised pride, nor during the anxieties of improvident distress. No  nation ever had, or will have, the power of suddenly developing, under  the pressure of necessity, faculties it had neglected when it was at  ease; nor of teaching itself in poverty, the skill to produce, what it  has never, in opulence, had the sense to admire.      7. Connected also with some of the worst parts of our social system, but  capable of being directed to better result than this commercial  endeavour, we see lately a most powerful impulse given to the production  of costly works of art, by the various causes which promote the sudden  accumulation of wealth in the hands of private persons. We have thus a  vast and new patronage, which, in its present agency, is injurious to  our schools; but which is nevertheless in a great degree earnest and  conscientious, and far from being influenced chiefly by motives of  ostentation. Most of our rich men would be glad to promote the true  interests of art in this country: and even those who buy for vanity,  found their vanity on the possession of what they suppose to be best.    It is therefore in a great measure the fault of artists themselves if  they suffer from this partly unintelligent, but thoroughly  well-intended, patronage. If they seek to attract it by eccentricity, to  deceive it by superficial qualities, or take advantage of it by  thoughtless and facile production, they necessarily degrade themselves  and it together, and have no right to complain afterwards that it will  not acknowledge better-grounded claims. But if every painter of real  power would do only what he knew to be worthy of himself, and refuse to  be involved in the contention for undeserved or accidental success,  there is indeed, whatever may have been thought or said to the contrary,  true instinct enough in the public mind to follow such firm guidance. It  is one of the facts which the experience of thirty years enables me to  assert without qualification, that a really good picture is ultimately  always approved and bought, unless it is wilfully rendered offensive to  the public by faults which the artist has been either too proud to  abandon or too weak to correct.      8. The development of whatever is healthful and serviceable in the two  modes of impulse which we have been considering, depends however,  ultimately, on the direction taken by the true interest in art which has  lately been aroused by the great and active genius of many of our  living, or but lately lost, painters, sculptors, and architects. It may  perhaps surprise, but I think it will please you to hear me, or (if you  will forgive me, in my own Oxford, the presumption of fancying that some  may recognise me by an old name) to hear the author of \"Modern Painters\"  say, that his chief error in earlier days was not in over estimating,  but in too slightly acknowledging the merit of living men. The great  painter whose power, while he was yet among us, I was able to perceive,  was the first to reprove me for my disregard of the skill of his  fellow-artists; and, with this inauguration of the study of the art of  all time,--a study which can only by true modesty end in wise  admiration,--it is surely well that I connect the record of these words  of his, spoken then too truly to myself, and true always more or less  for all who are untrained in that toil,--\"You don't know how difficult  it is.\"    You will not expect me, within the compass of this lecture, to give you  any analysis of the many kinds of excellent art (in all the three great  divisions) which the complex demands of modern life, and yet more varied  instincts of modern genius, have developed for pleasure or service. It  must be my endeavour, in conjunction with my colleagues in the other  Universities, hereafter to enable you to appreciate these worthily; in  the hope that also the members of the Royal Academy, and those of the  Institute of British Architects, may be induced to assist, and guide,  the efforts of the Universities, by organising such a system of  art-education for their own students, as shall in future prevent the  waste of genius in any mistaken endeavours; especially removing doubt as  to the proper substance and use of materials; and requiring compliance  with certain elementary principles of right, in every picture and design  exhibited with their sanction. It is not indeed possible for talent so  varied as that of English artists to be compelled into the formalities  of a determined school; but it must certainly be the function of every  academical body to see that their younger students are guarded from what  must in every school be error; and that they are practised in the best  methods of work hitherto known, before their ingenuity is directed to  the invention of others.      9. I need scarcely refer, except for the sake of completeness in my  statement, to one form of demand for art which is wholly unenlightened,  and powerful only for evil;--namely, the demand of the classes occupied  solely in the pursuit of pleasure, for objects and modes of art that can  amuse indolence or excite passion. There is no need for any discussion  of these requirements, or of their forms of influence, though they are  very deadly at present in their operation on sculpture, and on  jewellers' work. They cannot be checked by blame, nor guided by  instruction; they are merely the necessary result of whatever defects  exist in the temper and principles of a luxurious society; and it is  only by moral changes, not by art-criticism, that their action can be  modified.      10. Lastly, there is a continually increasing demand for popular art,  multipliable by the printing-press, illustrative of daily events, of  general literature, and of natural science. Admirable skill, and some of  the best talent of modern times, are occupied in supplying this want;  and there is no limit to the good which may be effected by rightly  taking advantage of the powers we now possess of placing good and lovely  art within the reach of the poorest classes. Much has been already  accomplished; but great harm has been done also,--first, by forms of art  definitely addressed to depraved tastes; and, secondly, in a more subtle  way, by really beautiful and useful engravings which are yet not good  enough to retain their influence on the public mind;--which weary it by  redundant quantity of monotonous average excellence, and diminish or  destroy its power of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],[0,"The Quirt (#2)"],[1,"up. But when he thought of them they seemed remote, prattling  youngsters whom Minnie was forever worrying over and who seemed to have  been always under the heels of his horse, or under the wheels of his  wagon, or playing with the pitchfork, or wandering off into the sage  while he and their distracted mother searched for them. For a long  while--how many years Brit could not remember--they had been living in  Los Angeles. Prospering, too, Brit understood. The girl,  Lorraine--Minnie had wanted fancy names for the kids, and Brit  apologized whenever he spoke of them, which was seldom--Lorraine had  written that \"Mamma has an apartment house.\" That had sounded  prosperous, even at the beginning. And as the years passed and their  address remained the same, Brit became fixed in the belief that the Casa  Grande was all that its name implied, and perhaps more. Minnie must be  getting rich. She had a picture of the place on the stationery which  Lorraine used when she wrote him. There were two palm trees in front,  with bay windows behind them, and pillars. Brit used to study these  magnificences and thank God that Minnie was doing so well. He never  could have given her a home like that. Brit sometimes added that he had  never been cut out for a married man, anyway.    Old-timers forgot that Brit had ever been married, and late comers never  heard of it. To all intents the owners of the Quirt outfit were old  bachelors who kept pretty much to themselves, went to town only when  they needed supplies, rode old, narrow-fork saddles and grinned  scornfully at \"swell-forks\" and \"buckin'-rolls,\" and listened to all the  range gossip without adding so much as an opinion. They never talked  politics nor told which candidates received their two votes. They kept  the same two men season after season,--leathery old range hands with  eyes that saw whatever came within their field of vision, and with the  gift of silence, which is rare.    If you know anything at all about cattlemen, you will know that the  Quirt was a poor man's ranch, when I tell you that Hunter and Johnson  milked three cows and made butter, fed a few pigs on the skim milk and  the alfalfa stalks which the saddle horses and the cows disdained to  eat, kept a flock of chickens, and sold what butter, eggs and pork they  did not need for themselves. Cattlemen seldom do that. More often they  buy milk in small tin cans, butter in \"squares,\" and do without eggs.    Four of a kind were the men of the TJ up-and-down, and even Bill  Warfield--president and general manager of the Sawtooth Cattle Company,  and of the Federal Reclamation Company and several other companies,  State senator and general benefactor of the Sawtooth country--even the  great Bill Warfield lifted his hat to the owners of the Quirt when he  met them, and spoke of them as \"the finest specimens of our old,  fast-vanishing type of range men.\" Senator Warfield himself represented  the modern type of range man and was proud of his progressiveness. Never  a scheme for the country's development was hatched but you would find  Senator Warfield closely allied with it, his voice the deciding one when  policies and progress were being discussed.    As to the Sawtooth, forty thousand acres comprised their holdings under  patents, deeds and long-time leases from the government. Another twenty  thousand acres they had access to through the grace of the owners, and  there was forest-reserve grazing besides, which the Sawtooth could have  if it chose to pay the nominal rental sum. The Quirt ranch was almost  surrounded by Sawtooth land of one sort or another, though there was  scant grazing in the early spring on the sagebrush wilderness to the  south. This needed Quirt Creek for accessible water, and Quirt Creek,  save where it ran through cut-bank hills, was fenced within the section  and a half of the TJ up-and-down.    So there they were, small fish making shift to live precariously with  other small fish in a pool where big fish swam lazily. If one small fish  now and then disappeared with mysterious abruptness, the other small  fish would perhaps scurry here and there for a time, but few would leave  the pool for the safe shallows beyond.    This is a tale of the little fishes.          CHAPTER TWO    THE ENCHANTMENT OF LONG DISTANCE      Lorraine Hunter always maintained that she was a Western girl. If she  reached the point of furnishing details she would tell you that she had  ridden horses from the time that she could walk, and that her father was  a cattle-king of Idaho, whose cattle fed upon a thousand hills. When she  was twelve she told her playmates exciting tales about rattlesnakes.  When she was fifteen she sat breathless in the movies and watched  picturesque horsemen careering up and down and around the thousand  hills, and believed in her heart that half the Western pictures were  taken on or near her father's ranch. She seemed to remember certain  landmarks, and would point them out to her companions and whisper a  desultory lecture on the cattle industry as illustrated by the picture.  She was much inclined to criticism of the costuming and the acting.    At eighteen she knew definitely that she hated the very name Casa  Grande. She hated the narrow, half-lighted hallway with its \"tree\"  where no one ever hung a hat, and the seat beneath where no one ever sat  down. She hated the row of key-and-mail boxes on the wall, with the bell  buttons above each apartment number. She hated the jangling of the hall  telephone, the scurrying to answer, the prodding of whichever bell  button would summon the tenant asked for by the caller. She hated the  meek little Filipino boy who swept that ugly hall every morning. She  hated the scrubby palms in front. She hated the pillars where the paint  was peeling badly. She hated the conflicting odors that seeped into the  atmosphere at certain hours of the day. She hated the three old maids on  the third floor and the frowsy woman on the first, who sat on the front  steps in her soiled breakfast cap and bungalow apron. She hated the  nervous tenant who occupied the apartment just over her mother's  three-room-and-bath, and pounded with a broom handle on the floor when  Lorraine practised overtime on chromatic scales.    At eighteen Lorraine managed somehow to obtain work in a Western  picture, and being unusually pretty she so far distinguished herself  that she was given a small part in the next production. Her glorious  duty it was to ride madly through the little cow-town \"set\" to the  post-office where the sheriff's posse lounged conspicuously, and there  pull her horse to an abrupt stand and point excitedly to the distant  hills. Also she danced quite close to the camera in the \"Typical Cowboy  Dance\" which was a feature of this particular production.    Lorraine thereby earned enough money to buy her fall suit and coat and  cheap furs, and learned to ride a horse at a gallop and to dance what  passed in pictures as a \"square dance.\"    At nineteen years of age Lorraine Hunter, daughter of old Brit Hunter of  the TJ up-and-down, became a real \"range-bred girl\" with a real Stetson  hat of her own, a green corduroy riding skirt, gray flannel shirt,  brilliant neckerchief, boots and spurs. A third picture gave her further  practice in riding a real horse,--albeit an extremely docile animal  called Mouse with good reason. She became known on the lot as a real  cattle-king's daughter, though she did not know the name of her father's  brand and in all her life had seen no herd larger than the thirty head  of tame cattle which were chased past the camera again and again to make  them look like ten thousand, and which were so thoroughly \"camera  broke\" that they stopped when they were out of the scene, turned and  were ready to repeat the performance _ad lib_.    Had she lived her life on the Quirt ranch she would have known a great  deal more about horseback riding and cattle and range dances. She would  have known a great deal less about the romance of the West, however, and  she would probably never have seen a sheriff's posse riding twenty  strong and bunched like bird-shot when it leaves the muzzle of the gun.  Indeed, I am very sure she would not. Killings such as her father heard  of with his lips drawn tight and the cords standing out on the sides of  his skinny neck she would have considered the grim tragedies they were,  without once thinking of the \"picture value\" of the crime.    As it was, her West was filled with men who died suddenly in gobs of red  paint and girls who rode loose-haired and panting with hand held over  the heart, hurrying for doctors, and cowboys and parsons and such. She  had seen many a man whip pistol from holster and dare a mob with lips  drawn back in a wolfish grin over his white, even teeth, and kidnappings  were the inevitable accompaniment of youth and beauty.    Lorraine learned rapidly. In three years she thrilled to more  blood-curdling adventure than all the Bad Men in all the West could have  furnished had they lived to be old and worked hard at being bad all  their lives. For in that third year she worked her way enthusiastically  through a sixteen-episode movie serial called \"The Terror of the Range.\"  She was past mistress of romance by that time. She knew her West.    It was just after the \"Terror of the Range\" was finished that a great  revulsion in the management of this particular company stopped  production with a stunning completeness that left actors and actresses  feeling very much as if the studio roof had fallen upon them. Lorraine's  West vanished. The little cow-town \"set\" was being torn down to make  room for something else quite different. The cowboys appeared in  tailored suits and drifted away. Lorraine went home to the Casa Grande,  hating it more than ever she had hated it in her life.    Some one up-stairs was frying liver and onions, which was in flagrant  defiance of Rule Four"]]]
