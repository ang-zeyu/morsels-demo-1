A hundred thousand pounds a year was the sum  agreed to; and half of the excise was settled in perpetuity upon the  crown as the fund whence this revenue should be levied. Though that  impost yielded more profit, the bargain might be esteemed hard; and it  was chiefly the necessity of the king's situation which induced him to  consent to it. No request of the parliament, during the present joy,  could be refused them.    Tonnage and poundage and the other half of the excise, were granted to  the king during life. The parliament even proceeded so far as to vote,  that the settled revenue of the crown for all charges should be one  million two hundred thousand pounds a year; a sum greater than any  English monarch had ever before enjoyed. But as all the princes  of Europe were perpetually augmenting their military force, and  consequently their expense, it became requisite that England, from  motives both of honor and security, should bear some proportion to them,  and adapt its revenue to the new system of politics which prevailed.  According to the chancellor's computation, a charge of eight hundred  thousand pounds a year was at present requisite for the fleet and other  articles, which formerly cost the crown but eighty thousand.    Had the parliament, before restoring the king, insisted on any further  limitations than those which the constitution already imposed, besides  the danger of reviving former quarrels among parties, it would seem that  their precaution had been entirely superfluous. By reason of its slender  and precarious revenue, the crown in effect was still totally dependent.  Not a fourth part of this sum, which seemed requisite for public  expenses, could be levied without consent of parliament; and any  concessions, had they been thought necessary, might, even after the  restoration, be extorted by the commons from their necessitous prince.  This parliament showed no intention of employing at present that engine  to any such purposes; but they seemed still determined not to part  with it entirely, or to render the revenues of the crown fixed and  independent. Though they voted in general, that one million two hundred  thousand pounds a year should be settled on the king, they scarcely  assigned any funds which could yield two thirds of that sum. And  they left the care of fulfilling their engagements to the future  consideration of parliament. In all the temporary supplies which they  voted, they discovered the same cautious frugality. To disband the army,  so formidable in itself, and so much accustomed to rebellion and  changes of government, was necessary for the security both of king and  parliament; yet the commons showed great jealousy in granting the sums  requisite for that end. An assessment of seventy thousand pounds a month  was imposed; but it was at first voted to continue only three months;  and all the other sums which they levied for that purpose, by a  poll-bill and new assessments, were still granted by parcels, as if they  were not as yet well assured of the fidelity of the hand to which the  money was intrusted. Having proceeded so far in the settlement of the  nation, the parliament adjourned itself for some time.    During the recess of parliament, the object which chiefly interested  the public, was the trial and condemnation of the regicides. The general  indignation attending the enormous crime of which these men had been  guilty, made their sufferings the subject of joy to the people: but  in the peculiar circumstances of that action, in the prejudices of the  times, as well as in the behavior of the criminals, a mind seasoned with  humanity will find a plentiful source of compassion and indulgence. Can  any one, without concern for human blindness and ignorance, consider the  demeanor of General Harrison, who was first brought to his trial? With  great courage and elevation of sentiment, he told the court, that the  pretended crime of which he stood accused, was not a deed performed in  a corner; the sound of it had gone forth to most nations; and in  the singular and marvellous conduct of it, had chiefly appeared the  sovereign power of Heaven: that he himself, agitated by doubts, had  often, with passionate tears, offered up his addresses to the divine  Majesty, and earnestly sought for light and conviction: he had still  received assurance of a heavenly sanction, and returned from these  devout supplications with more serene tranquillity and satisfaction:  that all the nations of the earth were, in the eyes of their Creator,  less than a drop of water in the bucket; nor were their erroneous  judgments aught but darkness, compared with divine illuminations: that  these frequent relapses of the divine spirit he could not suspect to  be interested illusions; since he was conscious, that for no temporal  advantage would he offer injury to the poorest man or woman that trod  upon the earth: that all the allurements of ambition, all the terrors  of imprisonment, had not been able, during the usurpation of Cromwell,  to shake his steady resolution, or bend him to a compliance with that  deceitful tyrant: and that when invited by him to sit on the right hand  of the throne, when offered riches and splendor and dominion, he had  disdainfully rejected all temptations; and neglecting the tears of  his friends and family, had still, through every danger, held fast his  principles and his integrity.    Scot, who was more a republican than a fanatic, had said in the house  of commons, a little before the restoration, that he desired no other  epitaph to be inscribed on his tombstone than this: \"Here lies Thomas  Scot, who adjudged the king to death.\" He supported the same spirit upon  his trial.    Carew, a Millenarian, submitted to his trial, \"saving to our Lord Jesus  Christ his right to the government of these kingdoms.\" Some scrupled  to say, according to form, that they would be tried by God and their  country; because God was not visibly present to judge them. Others said,  that they would be tried by the word of God.    No more than six of the late king's judges, Harrison, Scot, Carew,  Clement, Jones, and Scrope, were executed; Scrope alone, of all those  who came in upon the king's proclamation. He was a gentleman of good  family and of a decent character: but it was proved, that he had a  little before, in conversation, expressed himself as if he were nowise  convinced of any guilt in condemning the king. Axtel, who had guarded  the high court of justice, Hacker, who commanded on the day of the  king's execution, Coke, the solicitor for the people of England, and  Hugh Peters, the fanatical preacher, who inflamed the army and impelled  them to regicide; all these were tried, and condemned, and suffered with  the king's judges. No saint or confessor ever went to martyrdom  with more assured confidence of heaven, than was expressed by those  criminals, even when the terrors of immediate death, joined to many  indignities, were set before them. The rest of the king's judges, by an  unexampled lenity, were reprieved; and they were dispersed into several  prisons.    This punishment of declared enemies interrupted not the rejoicings of  the court: but the death of the duke of Gloucester, a young prince of  promising hopes, threw a great cloud upon them. The king, by no incident  in his life, was ever so deeply affected. Gloucester was observed  to possess united the good qualities of both his brothers: the clear  judgment and penetration of the king; the industry and application  of the duke of York. He was also believed to be affectionate to the  religion and constitution of his country. He was but twenty years of  age, when the small-pox put an end to his life.    The princess of Orange, having come to England in order to partake of  the joy attending the restoration of her family, with whom she lived in  great friendship, soon after sickened and died. The queen mother paid  a visit to her son; and obtained his consent to the marriage of the  princess Henrietta with the duke of Orleans, brother to the French king.    After a recess of near two months, the parliament met, and proceeded  in the great work of the national settlement. They established the  post-office, wine-licenses, and some articles of the revenue. They  granted more assessments, and some arrears for paying and disbanding  the army. Business, being carried on with great unanimity, was soon  despatched; and after they had sitten near two months, the king, in a  speech full of the most gracious expressions, thought proper to dissolve  them.    This house of commons had been chosen during the reign of the old  parliamentary party; and though many royalists had crept in amongst  them, yet did it chiefly consist of Presbyterians, who had not yet  entirely laid aside their old jealousies and principles. Lenthal, a  member, having said, that those who first took arms against the king  were as guilty as those who afterwards brought him to the scaffold, was  severely reprimanded by order of the house; and the most violent  efforts of the long parliament, to secure the constitution, and bring  delinquents to justice, were in effect vindicated and applauded.[*] The  claim of the two houses to the militia, the first ground of the quarrel,  however exorbitant a usurpation, was never expressly resigned by this  parliament. They made all grants of money with a very sparing hand.  Great arrears being due, by the protectors, to the fleet, the army, the  navy office, and every branch of service, this whole debt they threw  upon the crown, without establishing funds sufficient for its payment.  Yet, notwithstanding this jealous care expressed by the parliament,  there prevails a story, that Popham, having sounded the disposition of  the members, undertook to the earl of Southampton to procure, during  the king's life, a grant of two millions a year, land tax; a sum which,  added to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19217"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.II. (#2)"],[1,"evolution. Sancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, refused to consecrate  this ecclesiastic, though the reasons of his refusal are not specified;  but, being afraid of incurring the penalties of a premunire, he granted  a commission to the bishop of London, and three other suffragans, to  perform that ceremony. Burnet was a prelate of some parts, and great  industry; moderate in his notions of church discipline, inquisitive,  meddling, vain, and credulous. In consequence of having incurred the  displeasure of the late king, he had retired to the continent and fixed  his residence in Holland, where he was naturalized, and attached himself  to the interest of the prince of Orange, who consulted him about the  affairs of England. He assisted in drawing up the prince's manifesto,  and wrote some other papers and pamphlets in defence of his design.  He was demanded of the States by the English ambassador as a British  fugitive, outlawed by king James, and excepted in the act of indemnity.  Nevertheless, he came over with William in quality of his chaplain; and,  by his intrigues, contributed in some measure to the success of that  expedition. The principal individuals that composed this ministry have  been characterized in the history of the preceding reigns. We have had  occasion to mention the fine talents, the vivacity, the flexibility of  Halifax; the plausibility, the enterprising genius, the obstinacy of  Danby; the pompous eloquence, the warmth, and ostentation of Nottingham;  the probity and popularity of Shrewsbury. Godolphin, now brought into  the treasury, was modest, silent, sagacious, and upright. Mordaunt,  appointed first commissioner of that board, and afterwards created earl  of Monmouth, was open, generous, and a republican in his principles.  Delamere, chancellor of the exchequer, promoted in the sequel to the  rank of earl of Warrington, was close and mercenary. Obsequiousness,  fidelity, and attachment to his master, composed the character of  Bentinck, whom the king raised to the dignity of earl of Portland. The  English favourite, Sidney, was a man of wit and pleasure, possessed of  the most engaging talents for conversation and private friendship, but  rendered unfit for public business by indolence and inattention. He  was ennobled, and afterwards created earl of Romney; a title which he  enjoyed with several successive posts of profit and importance. The  stream of honour and preferment ran strong in favour of the whigs, and  this appearance of partiality confirmed the suspicion and resentment of  the opposite party.         * Sir John Holt was appointed lord chief justice of the king's            bench, and Sir Henry Pollexfen of the common pleas: the            earl of Devonshire was made lord steward of the            household, and the earl of Dorset lord            chamberlain.--_Ralph._    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          THE CONVENTION CONVERTED INTO A PARLIAMENT.    The first resolution taken in the new council was to convert the  convention into a parliament, that the new settlement might be  strengthened by a legal sanction, which was now supposed to be wanting,  as the assembly had not been convoked by the king's writ of summons.  The experiment of a new election was deemed too hazardous; therefore the  council determined that the king should, by virtue of his own authority,  change the convention into a parliament, by going to the house of peers  with the usual state of a sovereign, and pronouncing a speech from the  throne to both houses. This expedient was accordingly practised. [002]  _[See note B, at the end of this Vol.]_ He assured them he should never  take any step that would diminish the good opinion they had conceived  of his integrity. He told them that Holland was in such a situation as  required their immediate attention and assistance; that the posture of  affairs at home likewise demanded their serious consideration; that  a good settlement was necessary, not only for the establishment of  domestic peace, but also for the support of the protestant interest  abroad: that the affairs of Ireland were too critically situated to  admit the least delay in their deliberations; he therefore begged they  would be speedy and effectual in concerting such measures as should  be judged indispensably necessary for the welfare of the nation. The  commons returning to their house, immediately passed a vote of thanks  to his majesty, and made an order that his speech should be taken into  consideration. After the throne had been declared vacant by a small  majority of the peers, those who opposed that measure had gradually  withdrawn themselves from the house, so that very few remained but such  as were devoted to the new monarch. These therefore brought in a bill  for preventing all disputes concerning the present parliament. In the  meantime, Mr. Hambden, in the lower house, put the question, Whether  a king elected by the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons  assembled at Westminster, | coming to and consulting with the said lords  and commons, did not make as complete a parliament and legislative  power and authority as if the said king should cause new elections to  be made by writ? Many members affirmed that the king's writ was as  necessary as his presence to the being of a legal parliament, and as the  convention was defective in this particular, it could not be vested  with a parliamentary authority by any management whatsoever. The whigs  replied, That the essence of a parliament consisted in the meeting  and co-operation of the king, lords, and commons; and that it was not  material whether they were convoked by writ or by letter: they proved  this assertion by examples deduced from the history of England: they  observed that a new election would be attended with great trouble,  expense, and loss of time; and that such delay might prove fatal to  the protestant interest in Ireland, as well as to the allies on the  continent. In the midst of this debate the bill was brought down from  the lords, and being read, a committee was appointed to make some  amendments. These were no sooner made than the commons sent it back to  the upper house, and it immediately received the royal assent. By this  act the lords and commons assembled at Westminster were declared the two  houses of parliament to all intents and purposes: it likewise ordained,  That the present act, and all other acts to which the royal assent  should be given before the next prorogation, should be understood and  adjudged in law to begin on the thirteenth day of February: that the  members, instead of the old oaths of allegiance and supremacy, should  take the new oath incorporated in this act under the ancient penalty;  and that the present parliament should be dissolved in the usual manner.  Immediately after this transaction a warm debate arose in the house of  commons about the revenue, which the courtiers alleged had devolved with  the crown upon William, at least during the life of James, for which  term the greater part of it had been granted. The members in the  opposition affirmed that these grants were vacated with the throne; and  at length it was voted, That the revenue had expired. Then a motion was  made, That a revenue should be settled on the king and queen; and  the house resolved it should be taken into consideration. While they  deliberated on this affair they received a message from his majesty,  importing that the late king had set sail from Brest with an armament to  invade Ireland. They forthwith resolved to assist his majesty with  their lives and fortunes; they voted a temporary aid of four hundred and  twenty thousand pounds, to be levied by monthly assessments, and both  houses waited on the king to signify this resolution. But this unanimity  did not take place till several lords spiritual as well as temporal had,  rather than take the oaths, absented themselves from parliament. The  nonjuring prelates were Sancroft, archbishop of Canterbury; Turner,  bishop of Ely; Lake, of Chichester; Ken, of Bath and Wells; White, of  Peterborough; Lloyd, of Norwich; Thomas, of Worcester; and Frampton,  of Gloucester. The temporal peers who refused the oath were the duke  of Newcastle; the earls of Clarendon, Litchfield, Exeter, Yarmouth, and  Stafford; the lords Griffin and Stawel. Five of the bishops withdrew  themselves from the house at one time; but before they retired one of  the number moved for a bill of toleration, and another of comprehension,  by which moderate dissenters might be reconciled to the church, and  admitted into ecclesiastical benefices. Such bills were actually  prepared and presented by the earl of Nottingham, who received the  thanks of the house for the pains he had taken. From this period the  party averse to the government of William were distinguished by the  appellation of Nonjurors. They rejected the notion of a king _de facto_,  as well as all other distinctions and limitations; and declared for the  absolute power and divine hereditary indefeisible right of sovereigns.    {WILLIAM AND MARY, 1688--1701.}          MUTINY IN THE ARMY.    This faction had already begun to practise against the new government.  The king having received some intimation of their designs from  intercepted letters, ordered the earl of Arran, sir Robert Hamilton, and  some other gentlemen of the Scottish nation, to be apprehended and sent  prisoners to the Tower. Then he informed the two houses of the step he  had taken, and even craved their advice with regard to his conduct in  such a delicate affair which had compelled him to trespass upon the  law of England. The lords thanked him for the care he took of their  liberties, and desired he would secure all disturbers of the peace: but  the commons empowered him by a bill to dispense with the _habeas-corpus_  act till the seventeenth day of April next ensuing. This was a stretch  of confidence in the crown which had not been"]]]
