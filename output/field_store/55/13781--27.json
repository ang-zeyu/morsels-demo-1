It is unnecessary to state that their following was small when compared  with those who sought the assistance of their husbands, for scarcely a  week passed but some person came through the pine wood with his brows in  a tangle of perplexity.    In these people the children were deeply interested. They used to go  apart afterwards and talk about them, and would try to remember what  they looked like, how they talked, and their manner of walking or taking  snuff. After a time they became interested in the problems which these  people submitted to their parents and the replies or instructions  wherewith the latter relieved them. Long training had made the  children able to sit perfectly quiet, so that when the talk came to the  interesting part they were entirely forgotten, and ideas which might  otherwise have been spared their youth became the commonplaces of their  conversation.    When the children were ten years of age one of the Philosophers died. He  called the household together and announced that the time had come when  he must bid them all good-bye, and that his intention was to die as  quickly as might be. It was, he continued, an unfortunate thing that his  health was at the moment more robust than it had been for a long time,  but that, of course, was no obstacle to his resolution, for death did  not depend upon ill-health but upon a multitude of other factors with  the details whereof he would not trouble them.    His wife, the Grey Woman of Dun Gortin, applauded this resolution and  added as an amendment that it was high time he did something, that the  life he had been leading was an arid and unprofitable one, that he had  stolen her fourteen hundred maledictions for which he had no use and  presented her with a child for which she had none, and that, all things  concerned, the sooner he did die and stop talking the sooner everybody  concerned would be made happy.    The other Philosopher replied mildly as he lit his pipe: \"Brother,  the greatest of all virtues is curiosity, and the end of all desire  is wisdom; tell us, therefore, by what steps you have arrived at this  commendable resolution.\"    To this the Philosopher replied: \"I have attained to all the wisdom  which I am fitted to bear. In the space of one week no new truth has  come to me. All that I have read lately I knew before; all that I have  thought has been but a recapitulation of old and wearisome ideas. There  is no longer an horizon before my eves. Space has narrowed to the petty  dimensions of my thumb. Time is the tick of a clock. Good and evil are  two peas in the one pod. My wife's face is the same for ever. I want to  play with the children, and yet I do not want to. Your conversation with  me, brother, is like the droning of a bee in a dark cell. The pine trees  take root and grow and die.--It's all bosh. Good-bye.\"    His friend replied:    \"Brother, these are weighty reflections, and I do clearly perceive that  the time has come for you to stop. I might observe, not in order to  combat your views, but merely to continue an interesting conversation,  that there are still some knowledges which you have not assimilated--you  do not yet know how to play the tambourine, nor how to be nice to your  wife, nor how to get up first in the morning and cook the breakfast.  Have you learned how to smoke strong tobacco as I do? or can you dance  in the moonlight with a woman of the Shee? To understand the theory  which underlies all things is not sufficient. It has occurred to me,  brother, that wisdom may not be the end of everything. Goodness and  kindliness are, perhaps, beyond wisdom. Is it not possible that the  ultimate end is gaiety and music and a dance of joy? Wisdom is the  oldest of all things. Wisdom is all head and no heart. Behold, brother,  you are being crushed under the weight of your head. You are dying of  old age while you are yet a child.\"    \"Brother,\" replied the other Philosopher, \"your voice is like the  droning of a bee in a dark cell. If in my latter days I am reduced to  playing on the tambourine and running after a hag in the moonlight, and  cooking your breakfast in the grey morning, then it is indeed time that  I should die. Good-bye, brother.\"    So saying, the Philosopher arose and removed all the furniture to the  sides of the room so that there was a clear space left in the centre.  He then took off his boots and his coat, and standing on his toes he  commenced to gyrate with extraordinary rapidity. In a few moments his  movements became steady and swift, and a sound came from him like the  humming of a swift saw; this sound grew deeper and deeper, and at last  continuous, so that the room was filled with a thrilling noise. In a  quarter of an hour the movement began to noticeably slacken. In another  three minutes it was quite slow. In two more minutes he grew visible  again as a body, and then he wobbled to and fro, and at last dropped  in a heap on the floor. He was quite dead, and on his face was an  expression of serene beatitude.    \"God be with you, brother,\" said the remaining Philosopher, and he lit  his pipe, focused his vision on the extreme tip of his nose, and began  to meditate profoundly on the aphorism whether the good is the all or  the all is the good. In another moment he would have become oblivious of  the room, the company, and the corpse, but the Grey Woman of Dun Gortin  shattered his meditation by a demand for advice as to what should next  be done. The Philosopher, with an effort, detached his eyes from his  nose and his mind from his maxim.    \"Chaos,\" said he, \"is the first condition. Order is the first law.  Continuity is the first reflection. Quietude is the first happiness. Our  brother is dead--bury him.\" So saying, he returned his eyes to his nose,  and his mind to his maxim, and lapsed to a profound reflection wherein  nothing sat perched on insubstantiality, and the Spirit of Artifice  goggled at the puzzle.    The Grey Woman of Dun Gortin took a pinch of snuff from her box and  raised the keen over her husband:    \"You were my husband and you are dead.    It is wisdom that has killed you.    If you had listened to my wisdom instead of to your own you would still  be a trouble to me and I would still be happy.    Women are stronger than men--they do not die of wisdom.    They are better than men because they do not seek wisdom.    They are wiser than men because they know less and understand more.    I had fourteen hundred maledictions, my little store, and by a trick you  stole them and left me empty.    You stole my wisdom and it has broken your neck.    I lost my knowledge and I am yet alive raising the keen over your body,  but it was too heavy for you, my little knowledge.    You will never go out into the pine wood in the morning, or wander  abroad on a night of stars.    You will not sit in the chimney-corner on the hard nights, or go to bed,  or rise again, or do anything at all from this day out.    Who will gather pine cones now when the fire is going down, or call my  name in the empty house, or be angry when the kettle is not boiling?    Now I am desolate indeed. I have no knowledge, I have no husband, I have  no more to say.\"    \"If I had anything better you should have it,\" said she politely to the  Thin Woman of Inis Magrath.    \"Thank you,\" said the Thin Woman, \"it was very nice. Shall I begin now?  My husband is meditating and we may be able to annoy him.\"    \"Don't trouble yourself,\" replied the other, \"I am past enjoyment and  am, moreover, a respectable woman.\"    \"That is no more than the truth, indeed.\"    \"I have always done the right thing at the right time.\"    \"I'd be the last body in the world to deny that,\" was the warm response.    \"Very well, then,\" said the Grey Woman, and she commenced to take off  her boots. She stood in the centre of the room and balanced herself on  her toe.    \"You are a decent, respectable lady,\" said the Thin Woman of Inis  Magrath, and then the Grey Woman began to gyrate rapidly and more  rapidly until she was a very fervour of motion, and in three-quarters  of an hour (for she was very tough) she began to slacken, grew visible,  wobbled, and fell beside her dead husband, and on her face was a  beatitude almost surpassing his.    The Thin Woman of Inis Magrath smacked the children and put them to bed,  next she buried the two bodies under the hearthstone, and then, with  some trouble, detached her husband from his meditations. When he became  capable of ordinary occurrences she detailed all that had happened, and  said that he alone was to blame for the sad bereavement. He replied:    \"The toxin generates the anti-toxin. The end lies concealed in the  beginning. All bodies grow around a skeleton. Life is a petticoat about  death. I will not go to bed.\"    CHAPTER III    ON the day following this melancholy occurrence Meehawl MacMurrachu,  a small farmer in the neighbourhood, came through the pine trees with  tangled brows. At the door of the little house he said, \"God be with all  here,\" and marched in.    The Philosopher removed his pipe from his lips-\"God be with yourself,\"  said he, and he replaced his pipe.    Meehawl MacMurrachu crooked his thumb at space, \"Where is the other one?\"  said he.    \"Ah!\" said the Philosopher.    \"He might be outside, maybe?\"    \"He might, indeed,\" said the Philosopher gravely.    \"Well, it doesn't matter,\" said the visitor, \"for you have enough  knowledge by yourself to stock a shop. The reason I came here to-day was  to ask your honoured advice about my wife's washing-board.

Even the Galician poetry, which flourished so freely under  the external stimulus of the Provencal troubadours, can be  included only with regard to its influence upon Castilian.  The Galician dialect, spoken in the northwest corner of  the Peninsula, developed earlier than the Castilian of the  central region, and it was adopted by poets in other parts  for lyric verse. Alfonso X of Castile (reigned 1252-1284)  could write prose in Castilian, but he must needs employ  Galician for his _Cantigas de Santa Maria_. The Portuguese  nobles, with King Diniz (reigned 1279-1325) at their head,  filled the idle hours of their bloody and passionate lives  by composing strangely abstract, conventional poems of  love and religion in the manner of the Provencal _canso,  dansa, balada_ and _pastorela_, which had had such a  luxuriant growth in Southern France in the eleventh and  twelfth centuries. A highly elaborated metrical system  mainly distinguishes these writers, but some of               page xiii  their work catches a pleasing lilt which is supposed  to represent the imitation of songs of the people. The  popular element in the Galician productions is slight, but  it was to bear important fruit later, for its spirit is  that of the _serranas_ of Ruiz and Santillana, and of  _villancicos_ and eclogues in the sixteenth century.    It was probably in the neighborhood of 1350 that lyrics  began to be written in Castilian by the cultured classes  of Leon and Castile, who had previously thought Galician  the only proper tongue for that use, but the influence of  the Galician school persisted long after. The first real  lyric in Castilian is its offspring. This is the anonymous  _Razon feyta d'amor_ or _Aventura amorosa_ (probably  thirteenth century), a dainty story of the meeting of two  lovers. It is apparently an isolated example, ahead of its  time, unless, as is the case with the Castilian epic, more  poems are lost than extant. The often quoted _Cantica de  la Virgen_ of Gonzalo de Berceo (first half of thirteenth  century), with its popular refrain _Eya velar_, is an  oasis in the long religious epics of the amiable monk of  S. Millan de la Cogolla. One must pass into the succeeding  century to find the next examples of the true lyric. Juan  RUIZ, the mischievous Archpriest of Hita (flourished _ca_.  1350), possessed a genius sufficiently keen and human to  infuse a personal vigor into stale forms. In his _Libro de  buen amor_ he incorporated lyrics both sacred and profane,  _Loores de Santa Maria_ and _Canticas de serrana_, plainly  in the Galician manner and of complex metrical structure.  The _serranas_ are particularly free and unconventional.  The Chancellor Pero LOPEZ DE AYALA (1332-1407), wise  statesman, brilliant historian and trenchant                   page xiv  satirist, wrote religious songs in the same style and  still more intricate in versification. They are included  in the didactic poem usually called _El rimado de  palacio_.    Poetry flourished in and about the courts of the monarchs  of the Trastamara family; and what may be supposed a  representative collection of the work done in the reigns  of Henry II (1369-1379), John I (1379-1388), Henry III  (1388-1406) and the minority of John II (1406-1454), is  preserved for us in the _Cancionero_ which Juan Alfonso de  Baena compiled and presented to the last-named king. Two  schools of versifiers are to be distinguished in it. The  older men, such as Villasandino, Sanchez de Talavera,  Macias, Jerena, Juan Rodriguez del Padron and Baena  himself, continued the artificial Galician tradition, now  run to seed. In others appears the imitation of Italian  models which was to supplant the ancient fashion.  Francisco Imperial, a worshiper of Dante, and other  Andalusians such as Ruy Paez de Ribera, Pero Gonzalez de  Uceda and Ferran Manuel de Lando, strove to introduce  Italian meters and ideas. They first employed the Italian  hendecasyllable, although it did not become acclimated  till the days of Boscan. They likewise cultivated the  _metro de arte mayor_, which later became so prominent  (see below, p. lxxv ff.). But the interest of the poets of  the _Cancionero de Baena_ is mainly historical. In  spite of many an illuminating side-light on manners,  of political invective and an occasional glint of  imagination, the amorous platitudes and wire-drawn  love-contests of the Galician school, the stiff allegories  of the Italianates leave us cold. It was a transition  period and the most talented were unable to master the  undeveloped poetic language.                                    page xv      The same may be said, in general, of the whole fifteenth  century. Although the language became greatly clarified  toward 1500 it was not yet ready for masterly original  work in verse. Invaded by a flood of Latinisms, springing  from a novel and undigested humanism, encumbered still  with archaic words and set phrases left over from the  Galicians, it required purification at the hands of the  real poets and scholars of the sixteenth century. The  poetry of the fifteenth is inferior to the best prose of  the same epoch; it is not old enough to be quaint and not  modern enough to meet a present-day reader upon equal  terms.    These remarks apply only to artistic poetry. Popular  poetry,--that which was exemplified in the Middle Ages by  the great epics of the Cid, the Infantes de Lara and  other heroes, and in songs whose existence can rather be  inferred than proved,--was never better. It produced the  lyrico-epic _romances_ (see _Notes_, p. 253), which,  as far as one may judge from their diction and from  contemporary testimony, received their final form at  about this time, though in many cases of older origin. It  produced charming little songs which some of the later  court poets admired sufficiently to gloss. But the  cultured writers, just admitted to the splendid cultivated  garden of Latin literature, despised these simple wayside  flowers and did not care to preserve them for posterity.    The artistic poetry of the fifteenth century falls  naturally into three classes, corresponding to three  currents of influence; and all three frequently appear in  the work of one man, not blended, but distinct. One is  the conventional love-poem of the Galician school, seldom  containing a fresh or personal note. Another is the  stilted allegory with erotic or historical                     page xvi  content, for whose many sins Dante was chiefly  responsible, though Petrarch, he of the _Triunfi_, and  Boccaccio cannot escape some blame. Third is a vein of  highly moral reflections upon the vanity of life and  certainty of death, sometimes running to political satire.  Its roots may be found in the Book of Job, in Seneca and,  nearer at hand, in the _Proverbios morales_ of the Jew Sem  Tob (_ca_. 1350), in the _Rimado de Palacio_ of Ayala, and  in a few poets of the _Cancionero de Baena_.    John II was a dilettante who left the government of the  kingdom to his favorite, Alvaro de Luna. He gained more  fame in the world of letters than many better kings by  fostering the study of literature and gathering about him  a circle of \"court poets\" nearly all of noble birth. Only  two names among them all imperatively require mention.  Inigo LOPEZ DE MENDOZA, MARQUIS OF SANTILLANA (1398-1458)  was the finest type of _grand seigneur_, protector of  letters, student, warrior, poet and politician. He wrote  verse in all three of the manners just named, but he will  certainly be longest remembered for his _serranillas_, the  fine flower of the Provencal-Galician tradition, in which  the poet describes his meeting with a country lass.  Santillana combined the freshest local setting with  perfection of form and left nothing more to be desired in  that genre. He also wrote the first sonnets in Castilian,  but they are interesting only as an experiment, and had no  followers. Juan de MENA (1411-1456) was purely a literary  man, without other distinction of birth or accomplishment.  His work is mainly after the Italian model. The _Laberinto  de fortuna_, by which he is best known, is a dull allegory  with much of Dante's apparatus. There are historical  passages where the poet's patriotism leads him                page xvii  to a certain rhetorical height, but his good intentions  are weighed down by three millstones: slavish imitation,  the monotonous _arte mayor_ stanza and the deadly  earnestness of his temperament. He enjoyed great renown  and authority for many decades.    Two anonymous poems of about the same time deserve  mention. The _Danza de la muerte_, the Castilian  representative of a type which appeared all over Europe,  shows death summoning mortals from all stations of  life with ghastly glee. The _Coplas de Mingo Revulgo_,  promulgated during the reign of Henry IV (1454-1474), are  a political satire in dialogue form, and exhibit for the  first time the peculiar peasant dialect that later became  a convention of the pastoral eclogues and also of the  country scenes in the great drama.    The second half of the century continues the same  tendencies with a notable development in the fluidity of  the language and an increasing interest in popular poetry.  Gomez Manrique (d. 1491?) was another warrior of a  literary turn whose best verses are of a severely moral  nature. His nephew JORGE MANRIQUE (1440-1478) wrote a  single poem of the highest merit; his scanty other works  are forgotten. The _Coplas por la muerte de su padre_,  beautifully translated by Longfellow, contain some  laments for the writer's personal loss, but more general  reflections upon the instability of worldly glory. It is  not to be thought that this famous poem is in any way  original in idea; the theme had already been exploited to  satiety, but Manrique gave it a superlative perfection of  form and a contemporary application which left no room for  improvement.
