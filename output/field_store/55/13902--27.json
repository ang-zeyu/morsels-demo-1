If he choose to assume that they were really intended as  imitations, although in many particulars unlike the animals he wishes to  believe them to represent, and that they are as close copies as can be  expected from sculptors not possessed of skill adequate to carry out  their rude conceptions, he will practically have abandoned the position  taken by many prominent archaeologists with respect to the mound  sculptors' skill, and will be forced to accord them a position on the  plane of art not superior to the one occupied by the North American  Indians. If it should prove that but a small minority of the carvings  can be specifically identified, owing to inaccuracies and to their  general resemblance, he may indeed go even further and conclude that  they form a very unsafe basis for deductions that owe their very  existence to assumed accurate imitation.      MANATEE.    In 1848 Squier and Davis published their great work on the Mounds of the  Mississippi Valley. The skill and zeal with which these gentlemen  prosecuted their researches in the field, and the ability and fidelity  which mark the presentation of their results to the public are  sufficiently attested by the fact that this volume has proved alike the  mine from which subsequent writers have drawn their most important  facts, and the chief inspiration for the vast amount of work in the same  direction since undertaken.    On pages 251 and 252 of the above-mentioned work appear figures of an  animal which is there called \"Lamantin, Manitus, or Sea Cow,\"  concerning which animal it is stated that \"seven sculptured  representations have been taken from the mounds.\" When first discovered,  the authors continue, \"it was supposed they were monstrous creations of  fancy; but subsequent investigations and comparison have shown that they  are faithful representations of one of the most singular animal  productions of the world.\"    These authors appear to have been the first to note the supposed  likeness of certain of the sculptured forms found in the mounds to  animals living in remote regions. That they were not slow to perceive  the ethnological interest and value of the discovery is shown by the  fact that it was immediately adduced by them as affording a clew to the  possible origin of the Mound-Builders. The importance they attached to  the discovery and their interpretation of its significance will be  apparent from the following quotation (p. 242):         Some of these sculptures have a value, so far as ethnological       research is concerned, much higher than they can claim as mere       works of art. This value is derived from the fact that they       faithfully represent animals and birds peculiar to other latitudes,       thus establishing a migration, a very extensive intercommunication       or a contemporaneous existence of the same race over a vast extent       of country.    The idea thus suggested fell on fruitful ground, and each succeeding  writer who has attempted to show that the Mound-Builders were of a race  different from the North American Indian, or had other than an  autochthonous origin, has not failed to lay especial stress upon the  presence in the mounds of sculptures of the manatee, as well as of other  strange beasts and birds, carved evidently by the same hands that  portrayed many of our native fauna.    Except that the theories based upon the sculptures have by recent  writers been annunciated more positively and given a wider range, they  have been left almost precisely as set forth by the authors of the  \"Ancient Monuments,\" while absolutely nothing appears to have been  brought to light since their time in the way of additional sculptured  evidence of the same character. It is indeed a little curious to note  the perfect unanimity with which most writers fall back upon the above  authors as at once the source of the data they adduce in support of the  several theories, and as their final, nay, their only, authority. Now  and then one will be found to dissent from some particular bit of  evidence as announced by Squier and Davis, or to give a somewhat  different turn to the conclusions derivable from the testimony offered  by them. But in the main the theories first announced by the authors of  \"Ancient Monuments,\" as the result of their study of the mound  sculptures, are those that pass current to-day. Particular attention may  be called to the deep and lasting impression made by the statements of  these authors as to the great beauty and high standard of excellence  exhibited by the mound sculptures. Since their time writers appear to be  well satisfied to express their own admiration in the terms made use of  by Squier and Davis. One might, indeed, almost suppose that recent  writers have not dared to trust to the evidence afforded by the original  carvings or their fac-similes, but have preferred to take the word of  the authors of the \"Ancient Monuments\" for beauties which were perhaps  hidden from their own eyes.    Following the lead of the authors of the \"Ancient Monuments,\" also, with  respect to theories of origin, these carvings of supposed foreign  animals are offered as affording incontestible evidence that the  Mound-Builders must have migrated from or have had intercourse, direct  or indirect, with the regions known to harbor these animals. Were it  not, indeed, for the evident artistic similarity between these carvings  of supposed foreign animals and those of common domestic forms--a  similarity which, as Squier and Davis remark, render them  \"indistinguishable, so far as material and workmanship are concerned,  from an entire class of remains found in the mounds\"--the presence of  most of them could readily be accounted for through the agency of trade,  the far reaching nature of which, even among the wilder tribes, is well  understood. Trade, for instance, in the case of an animal like the  manatee, found no more than a thousand miles distant from the point  where the sculpture was dug up, would offer a possible if not a probable  solution of the matter. But independently of the fact that the  practically identical character of all the carvings render the theory of  trade quite untenable, the very pertinent question arises, why, if these  supposed manatee pipes were derived by trade from other regions, have  not similar carvings been found in those regions, as, for instance, in  Florida and the Gulf States, a region of which the archaeology is fairly  well known. Primitive man, as is the case with his civilized brother,  trades usually out of his abundance; so that not seven, but many times  seven, manatee pipes should be found at the center of trade. As it is,  the known home of the manatee has furnished no carvings either of the  manatee or of anything suggestive of it.    The possibility of the manatee having in past times possessed a wider  range than at present seems to have been overlooked. But as a matter of  fact the probability that the manatee ever ranged, in comparatively  modern times at least, as far north as Ohio without leaving other traces  of its presence than a few sculptured representations at the hands of an  ancient people is too small to be entertained.    Nor is the supposition that the Mound-Builders held contemporaneous  possession of the country embraced in the range of the animals whose  effigies are supposed to have been exhumed from their graves worthy of  serious discussion. If true, it would involve the contemporaneous  occupancy by the Mound-Builders, not only of the Southern United States  but of the region stretching into Southern Mexico, and even, according  to the ideas of some authors, into Central and South America, an area  which, it is needless to say, no known facts will for a moment justify  us in supposing a people of one blood to have occupied  contemporaneously.    Assuming, therefore, that the sculptures in question are the work of  the Mound-Builders and are not derived from distant parts through the  agency of trade, of which there would appear to be little doubt, and,  assuming that the sculptures represent the animals they have been  supposed to represent--of which something remains to be said--the theory  that the acquaintance of the Mound-Builders with these animals was made  in a region far distant from the one to which they subsequently migrated  would seem to be not unworthy of attention. It is necessary, however,  before advancing theories to account for facts to first consider the  facts themselves, and in this case to seek an answer to the question how  far the identification of these carvings of supposed foreign animals is  to be trusted. Before noticing in detail the carvings supposed by Squier  and Davis to represent the manatee, it will be well to glance at the  carvings of another animal figured by the same authors which, it is  believed, has a close connection with them.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.--Otter. From Ancient Monuments.]    Figure 4 is identified by the authors of the \"Ancient Monuments\" (Fig.  156) as an otter, and few naturalists will hesitate in pronouncing it to  be a very good likeness of that animal; the short broad ears, broad head  and expanded snout, with the short, strong legs, would seem to belong  unmistakably to the otter. Added to all these is the indication of its  fish-catching habits. Having thus correctly identified this animal, and  with it before them, it certainly reflects little credit upon the  zoological knowledge of the authors and their powers of discrimination  to refer the next figure (Ancient Monuments, Fig. 157) to the same  animal.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.--Otter of Squier and Davis.]    Of a totally different shape and physiognomy, if intended as an otter it  certainly implies an amazing want of skill in its author.

Very often, however,  the dreamer's reveries were interrupted, and at such times there was  no lack of excitement.    =Wild beasts.=--There were more beasts of prey in Arabia in those days  than there are to-day. In addition to wolves and bears, there were  many lions, which are not now found anywhere in the world except in  Africa. So the sheepmen had to go well armed, with clubs, swords, and  spears. We would want a high-powered rifle if we were in danger of  facing a lion. The Hebrews defended their flocks against these  powerful and vicious beasts with only the simplest weapons. Such  fights were anything but monotonous.     +-------------------------------------------------------------------+   | [Illustration: A DARIC, OR PIECE OF MONEY COINED BY DARIUS, ONE   |   | OF THE EARLIEST SPECIMENS OF COINED MONEY]                        |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: ANCIENT HEBREW WEIGHTS FOR BALANCES]               |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: HEBREW DRY AND LIQUID MEASURES]                    |   |                                                                   |   | Cuts on this page used by permission of the Palestine Exploration |   | Fund.                                                             |   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+      TRIPS TO TOWN    Among the most interesting events in the lives of the shepherds were  their trips to town, when they sold some of their wool and bought  grain, and linen cloth, and trinkets for the babies, and the things  they could not find nor make on the grassy plains. The raw wool was  packed in bags and slung over the backs of donkeys. On other donkeys  rode two or more of the men of the tribe. Sometimes, perhaps, a small  boy was taken along on the donkey's back behind his father to see the  sights. And for him the sights must have been rather wonderful--the  great thick walls of the town, the massive gates, the houses, row on  row, and the people, more of them in one street than in the whole  tribe to which he belonged!    =The market.=--They took their wool, of course, to the open square  where all the merchants sold their goods. Soon buyers appeared who  wanted wool. It was a long process then, as now, to strike a bargain  in an Oriental town. It is very impolite to seem to be in a hurry. You  must each ask after one another's health, and the health of your  respective fathers, and all your ancestors. By and by, you cautiously  come around to the subject of wool. How much do you want for your  wool? At first you don't name a price. You aren't even sure that you  want to sell it. Finally you mention a sum about five times as large  as you expect to get. The buyer in turn offers to pay about a fifth of  what it is worth. After a time you come down a bit on your price. The  buyer comes up a bit on his. After an hour or two, or perhaps a half  a day, you compromise and the wool is sold.    =Weighing out the silver or gold.=--In those early days there was no  coined money. Silver and gold were used as money, only they had to be  weighed every time a trade was put through; just as though we were to  sell so many pounds of flour for so many ounces of silver. The weights  used were very crude; usually they were merely rough stones from the  field with the weight mark scratched on them. The scale generally used  was as follows:         60 shekels = 1 mana.       60 manas = 1 talent.    The shekel was equal to about an ounce, in our modern avoirdupois  system. There was no accurate standard weight anywhere. Honest dealers  tried to have weights which corresponded to custom. But it was easy to  cheat by having two sets of weights, one for buying and one for  selling. So when our shepherds came to town, they had to watch the  merchant who bought from them lest he put too heavy a talent weight in  the balance with their wool, and too light a shekel-weight in the  smaller balance with the silver.      THE HARD SIDE OF SHEPHERD LIFE    The most precious and uncertain thing in the shepherd's life was  water. If in the rainy season the rains were heavy, and the wells and  brooks did not dry up too soon in the summer, they had plenty of  goat's milk for food, and could bring plenty of wool to market in the  fall. But if the rains were scant their flocks perished, and actual  famine and death stared them in the face. In the dry years many were  the tribes that were almost totally wiped out by famine and the  diseases that sweep away hungry men. The next year, on the site of  their last camp, strangers would find the bones of men and women and  little children, whitening by the side of the trail. No wonder they  looked upon wells and springs as sacred. Surely, they thought, a god  must be the giver of those life-giving waters that bubble up so  mysteriously from the crevices in the rock.    =War with other tribes.=--In addition to their constant struggle to  make a living from a somewhat barren land, these shepherds were almost  constantly in danger from human enemies. A small, weak tribe, grazing  its flocks around a good well, was always in danger lest a stronger  tribe swoop down upon them to kill and plunder. There were many robber  clans who did little else besides preying on their neighbors and  passing caravans of traders. Nowhere was there any security. The  desert and its borders was a world of bitter hatreds and long-standing  feuds. Certain rival tribes fought each other at every opportunity for  centuries with a warfare that hesitated at no cruelty or treachery.      DESERT RELIGION    Such a life of eager longings, fierce passions, and dark despair is a  fertile soil for religion. And these early Hebrew shepherds were  intensely religious. It is true that in the earliest days the  fierceness and cruelty of their wars were reflected in the character  of the gods in whom they believed. They thought of them as doing many  cruel and selfish things. Yet a people who believe very deeply and  seriously in their religion, even in an imperfect religion, are sure  to be a force in the world. Hence it is not surprising that three of  the world's greatest religions, Judaism, Christianity, and  Mohammedanism, arose at different times among the wandering shepherds  of Arabia.      STUDY TOPICS    It would be well to keep a notebook in which to write the result of  your study.    1. Look up in any Bible dictionary, under \"Weights and Measures,\" the  approximate size of an \"ephah,\" which was the common Hebrew unit of  dry measure, and \"hin,\" which was their common unit for measuring  liquids.    2. From the facts given in this chapter, calculate in pounds  avoirdupois, the approximate weight of a talent.    3. To what extent does the Old Testament reflect the experiences of  shepherd life? Look up \"shepherd\" in any concordance.    4. What are some valuable lessons which great spiritual teachers among  the Hebrews learned from their shepherd life? Read Psalm 23.          CHAPTER II    HOME LIFE IN THE TENTS      Most persons, no matter what their race or country, spend a large  proportion of their time at home. The home is the center of many  interests and activities, and it reflects quite accurately the state  of civilization of a people. In this chapter let us take a look into  the homes of the shepherd Hebrews. We shall visit one of their  encampments; perhaps we shall be reminded of a camp of the gypsies.      A CLUSTER OF BLACK TENTS    Here on a gentle hillside sloping up from a tiny brook, is a cluster  of ten or a dozen black tents. Further down the valley sheep are  grazing. Two or three mongrel dogs rush out to bark at us as we  approach, until a harsh voice calls them back. A dark man with bare  brown arms comes out to meet us, wearing a coarse woolen cloak with  short sleeves. Half-naked children peer out from the tent flaps.    =The inside of the tents.=--Our friend is eager to show us hospitality  and invites us to enter his tent. It is a low, squatting affair, and  we have to stoop low to enter the opening in the front. We note that  the tent-cloth is a woolen fabric not like our canvas of to-day. It is  stretched across a center-pole, with supports on the front and back,  while the edges are pinned to the ground much as our tents are. There  are curtains within the tent partitioning off one part for the men,  and another for the women and children. There are mats on the ground  to sit on and to sleep on at night.      PREPARING FOOD    Like the housewives of all ages, the Hebrew women have food to  prepare, and meals to get. Their one great food is milk, not cows'  milk, but the milk of goats. A modern traveler tells of meeting an  Arab who in a time of scarcity had lived on milk alone for more than a  year.    =A meager diet.=--Besides fresh milk there were then as now a number  of things which were made from milk. The Hebrews on the desert took  some milk and cream and poured it into a bag made of skin, and hung it  by a stout cord from a pole. One of the women, or a boy, pounded this  bag until the butter came out. This was their way of churning. Cheese  also was a favorite article of diet. The milk was curdled by means of  the sour or bitter juices of certain plants, and the curds were then  salted and dried in the sun. Curdled milk even more than sweet milk  was also used as a drink. It probably tasted like the _kumyss_, or  _zoolak_, which we can buy in our drug stores or soda fountains.    We would get very tired of milk and milk products if we had nothing  else to eat all the year round; and so did these"]]]
