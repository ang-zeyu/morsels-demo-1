To himself he called trailherd--but father's cattle  did not carry white lumps of stuff on their heads, and furthermore, they  all walked together in the same direction; whereas the ant herd traveled  both ways. Buddy made sure of this, and then started off, following what  he had decided was the real trail of the ants. Most children would have  stirred them up with a stick; Buddy let them alone so that he could see  what they were doing all by themselves.    The ants led him to a tiny hole with a finely pulverized rim just at the  edge of a sprawly cactus. This last Buddy carefully avoided, for even  at four years old he had long ago learned the sting of cactus thorns. A  rattlesnake buzzed warning when he backed away and the shock to Buddy's  nerves roused within him the fighting spirit. Rattlesnakes he knew also,  as the common enemy of men and cattle. Once a steer had been bitten on  the nose and his head had swollen up so he couldn't eat. Buddy did not  want that to happen to HIM.    He made sure that the horned toad was safe, chose a rock as large as he  could lift and heave from him, and threw it at the buzzing, gray coil.  He did not wait to see what happened, but picked up another rock, a  terrific buzzing sounding stridently from the coil. He threw another  and another with all the force of his healthy little muscles. For a  four-year-old he aimed well; several of the rocks landed on the coil.    The snake wriggled feebly from under the rocks and tried to crawl away  and hide, its rattles clicking listlessly. Buddy had another rock in  his hands and in his eyes the blue fire of righteous conquest. He  went close-close enough to have brought a protesting cry from a  grownup-lifted the rock high as he could and brought it down fair on  the battered head of the rattler. The loathsome length of it winced  and thrashed ineffectively, and after a few minutes lay slack, the tail  wriggling aimlessly.    Buddy stood with his feet far apart and his hands on his hips, as he had  seen the cowboy do whom he had unconsciously imitated in the killing.    \"Snakes like Injuns. Dead'ns is good 'ens,\" He observed sententiously,  still playing the part of the cowboy. Then, quite sure that the snake  was dead, he took it by the tail, felt again of the horned toad on his  chest and went back to see what the ants were doing.    When so responsible a person as a grownup stops to watch the orderly  activities of an army of ants, minutes and hours slip away unnoticed.  Buddy was absolutely fascinated, lost to everything else. When some  instinct born in the very blood of him warned Buddy that time was  passing, he stood up and saw that the sun hung just above the edge of  the world, and that the sky was a glorious jumble of red and purple and  soft rose.    The first thing Buddy did was to stoop and study attentively the dead  snake, to see if the tail still wiggled. It did not, though he watched  it for a full minute. He looked at the sun--it had not set but glowed  big and yellow as far from the earth as his father was tall. Ezra had  lied to him. Dead snakes did not wiggle their tails until sundown.    Buddy looked for the dust cloud of the herd, and was surprised to find  it smaller than he had ever seen it, and farther away. Indeed, he could  only guess that the faint smudge on the horizon was the dust he had  followed for more days than he could count. He was not afraid, but he  was hungry and he thought his mother would maybe wonder where he was,  and he knew that the point-riders had already stopped pushing the herd  ahead, and that the cattle were feeding now so that they would bed  down at dusk. The chuckwagon was camped somewhere close by, and old  Step-and-a-Half, the lame cook, was stirring things in his Dutch ovens  over the camp-fire. Buddy could almost smell the beans and the meat  stew, he was so hungry. He turned and took one last, long look at the  endless stream of ants still crawling along, picked up the dead snake by  the tail, cupped the other hand over the horned toad inside his waist,  and started for camp.    After a while he heard someone shouting, but beyond faint relief that he  was after all near his \"Outfit\", Buddy paid no attention. The boys were  always shouting to one another, or yelling at their horses or at the  herd or at the niggers. It did not occur to him that they might  be shouting for him, until from another direction he heard Ezra's  unmistakable, booming voice. Ezra sang a thunderous baritone when the  niggers lifted up their voices in song around their camp-fire, and he  could be heard for half a mile when he called in real earnest. He was  calling now, and Buddy, stopping to listen, fancied that he heard his  name. A little farther on, he was sure of it.    \"OOO-EE! Whah y'all, Buddy? OOO-EEE!\"    \"I'm a-comin',\" Buddy shrilled impatiently. \"What y' all want?\"    His piping voice did not carry to Ezra, who kept on shouting. The  radiant purple and red and gold above him deepened, darkened. The whole  wild expanse of half-barren land became suddenly a place of unearthly  beauty that dulled to the shadows of dusk. Buddy trudged on, keeping  to the deep-worn buffalo trails which the herd had followed and scored  afresh with their hoofs. He could not miss his way-not Buddy, son of Bob  Birnie, owner of the Tomahawk outfit-but his legs were growing pretty  tired, and he was so hungry that he could have sat down on the ground  and cried with the gnawing food-call of his empty little stomach.    He could hear other voices shouting at intervals now, but Ezra's voice  was the loudest and the closest, and it seemed to Buddy that Ezra never  once stopped calling. Twice Buddy called back that he was a-comin', but  Ezra shouted just the same: \"OOO-EE! WHAH Y' ALL, BUDDY? OOO-EE!\"    Imperceptibly dusk deepened to darkness. A gust of anger swept Buddy's  soul because he was tired, because he was hungry and he was yet a long  way from the camp, but chiefly because Ezra persisted in calling after  Buddy had several times answered. He heard someone whom he recognized  as Frank Davis, but by this time he was so angry that he would not say a  word, though he was tempted to ask Frank to take him up on his horse and  let him ride to camp. He heard others-and once the beat of hoofs came  quite close. But there was a wide streak of Scotch stubbornness in  Buddy--along with several other Scotch streaks--and he continued his  stumbling progress, dragging the snake by the tail, his other hand  holding fast the horned toad.    His heart jumped up and almost choked him when first saw the three  twinkles on the ground which knew were not stars but camp-fires.    Quite unexpectedly he trudged into the firelight where Step-and-a-Half  was stirring delectable things in the iron pots and stopping every  minute or so to stare anxiously into the gloom. Buddy stood blinking and  sniffing, his eyes fixed upon the Dutch ovens.    \"I'm HUNGRY!\" he announced accusingly, gripping the toad that had begun  to squirm at the heat and light. \"I kilt a snake an' I'm HUNGRY!\"    \"Good gorry!\" swore Step-and-a-Half, and whipped out his six-shooter and  fired three shots into the air.    Footsteps came scurrying. Buddy's mother swept him into her arms,  laughing with a little whimpering sound of tears in the laughter. Buddy  wriggled protestingly in her arms.    \"L'kout! Y' all SKUCSH 'im! I got a HAWN-toe; wight here.\" He patted his  chest gloatingly. \"An' I got a snake. I kilt 'im. An' I'm HUNGRY.\"    Mother of Buddy though she was, Lassie set him down hurriedly and  surveyed her man-child from a little distance.    \"Buddy! Drop that snake instantly'\"    Buddy obeyed, but he planted a foot close to his kill and pouted his  lips. \"'S my snake. I kilt 'im,\" He said firmly. He pulled the horned  toad from his waist-front and held it tightly in his two hands. \"An's my  hawn-toe. I ketche'd'm. 'Way ova dere,\" he added, tilting his tow head  toward the darkness behind him.    Bob Birnie rode up at a gallop, pulled up his horse in the edge of the  fire glow and dismounted hastily.    Bob Birnie never needed more than one glance to furnish him the details  of a scene. He saw the very small boy confronting his mother with a dead  snake, a horned toad and a stubborn set to his lips. He saw that the  mother looked rather helpless before the combination--and his brown  mustache hid a smile. He walked up and looked his first-born over.    \"Buddy,\" He demanded sternly, \"where have you been?\"    \"Out dere. Kilt a snake. Ants was trailing a herd. I got a HAWN-toe. An'  I'm hungry!\"    \"You know better than to leave the wagon, young man. Didn't you know we  had to get out and hunt you, and mother was scared the wolves might eat  you? Didn't you hear us calling you? Why didn't you answer?\"    Buddy looked up from under his baby eyebrows at his father, who seemed  very tall and very terrible. But his bare foot touched the dead snake  and he took comfort. \"I was comin',\" he said. \"I WASN'T los'. I bringed  my snake and my hawn-toe. An' dey--WASN'T--any--woluffs!\" The last word  came muffled, buried in his mother's skirts.        CHAPTER TWO: THE TRAIL HERD    Day after day the trail herd plodded slowly to the north, following the  buffalo trails that would lead to water, and the crude map of one who  had taken a herd north and had returned with a tale of vast plains and  no rivals. Always through the day the dust cloud hung over the backs of  the cattle, settled into the clothes of those who followed, grimed the  pink aprons of Buddy and his small sister Dulcie so that they were no  longer pink. Whenever a stream was reached, mother searched patiently  for clear water and an untrampled bit of bank where she might do the  family washing, leaving Ezra to mind the children. But even so the crust  and the wear and tear of travel remained to harass her fastidious "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17249"],[0,"Added Upon (#2)"],[1,"after him.    Then went the news abroad throughout heaven of the council and the  Father's proposed plan; of Christ's offer, and Lucifer's rebellious  actions. The whole celestial realm was agitated, and contention and  strife began to wage among the children of God.    Returning from the council chamber of the celestial glance through the  paths of the surrounding gardens, came two sons of God. Apparently, the  late events had affected them greatly. The assembly had dispersed, and,  save now and then a fleeting figure, they were alone. They were engaged  in earnest conversation.    \"But, Brother Sardus,\" said one, \"how can you look at it in that light?  Lucifer was surely in the wrong. And then, how haughty and overbearing  he was.\"    \"I cannot agree with you, Homan. We have a right to think and to act as  we please, and I consider Lucifer in the right. Think of this  magnificent offer, to bring back in glory to Father's presence, every  one of His children, and that, too, without condition on their part.\"    \"There! He, and you with him, talk about your rights to think and act as  you please. Have you not that right? Have you not used it freely in  refusing to listen to Father's counsel? Do not I exercise it in that I  listen and agree with Him? But let me tell you, brother, what your  reasoning will lead to.\"    \"I know it--but go on.\"    \"No, you do not; you do not seem to understand.\"    \"Perhaps you will explain,\" said the other haughtily.    \"Brother, be not angry. It is because of my love for you that I speak  thus. It is evident that we, in that future world of experience and  trial, will retain our agencies to choose between the opposites that  will be presented to us. Without that privilege, we should cease to be  intelligences, and become as inanimate things. How could we be proved  without this power? How could we make any progress without it?\"    \"I grant it all.\"    \"Then, what would Lucifer do? He would save you from the dangers of the  world, whether you would or not. He would take away any need of volition  or choice on our part. Do what we would, sink as deep into sin as we  could, he would save us notwithstanding, without a trial, without a  purging process, with all our sins upon us; and in this condition we are  expected to go on to perfection, and become kings and priests unto God  our Father, exercising power and dominion over our fellow creatures.  Think of it! Evil would reign triumphant. Celestial order would be  changed to chaos.\"    The other said not a word. He could not answer his brother's array of  arguments.    \"Dear brother,\" continued Homan, \"never before have I received such  sorrow as when I saw you follow that rebellious Son of Morning.  Henceforth quit his company. I fear for him and his followers.\"    \"But he has such power over me, Homan. His eloquence seems to hold me,  and his arguments certainly convince me. But I must go--and brother,  come with me to the assembly which we are to hold. Many will be there  from far and near. Will you come?\"    \"I cannot promise you, Sardus. Perhaps I may call and see what is said  and done.\"    Then they parted.    Homan went to the gathering of which Sardus had spoken, and as had been  intimated, he met many strange faces. Everywhere in the conversation,  serious topics seemed to be uppermost. The singing was not as usual. The  music, though always sweet, was sadder than ever before, and a discord  seemed to have crept into the even flow of life's sweet strain. Homan  had no desire to talk. He wandered from group to group with a smile for  all. Sardus was in a heated discussion with some kindred spirits; but  Homan did not join them. Under the beautiful spread of the trees and by  the fountains, sat and walked companies of sons and daughters of God.  Ah, they were fair to look upon, and Homan wondered at the creations of  the Father. No two were alike, yet all bore an impress of the Creator,  and each had an individual beauty of his own.    Strolling into an arbor of vines, Homan, did not observe the fair  daughter seated there until he turned to leave; and then he saw her. She  seemed absorbed in thought, and her eyes rested on the shiftings  throngs.    \"A sweet face, and a strange one,\" thought he, as he went up to her and  spoke:    \"Sister, what are you thinking about?\"    She turned and looked at him, and then a pleased smile overspread her  face.    \"Shall I tell you?\"    \"Do, I beg of you. May I sit here?\" He seated himself opposite.    \"Yes, brother, sit. My thoughts had such a strange ending that I will  tell you what they were. I have been sitting here looking at these many  faces, both new and old, and studying their varied beauties; but none  seems to me to answer for my ideal. So I have been taking a little from  each face, putting all together to form another. I had just completed  the composition, and was looking admiringly at the new form when you  came and--and--\"    \"Drove away your picture. That I should not have done.\"    \"No; it was not exactly that. It is so odd.\" She hesitated and turned  away her head. Then she looked up into his face again and said: \"My  dream face seemed to blend with yours.\"    They looked at each other strangely.    \"Do you often make dream pictures?\" asked he.    \"Yes, of late; but I sometimes think I should not.\"    \"Why?\"    \"Because of them any great events that are taking place around us daily  which need our careful thought and consideration. I have been trying to  comprehend this great plan of our Father's in regards to us. I have  asked Mother many questions, and she has explained, but I cannot fully  understand--only, it all seems so wonderful, and our Father is so good  and great and wise;--but how could He be otherwise, having Himself come  up through the school of the eternities?\"    Her words were music to Homan's ear. Her voice was soft and sweet.    \"Yet it is very strange. To think that we shall forget all we know, and  that our memories will fail to recall this world at all.\"    \"Yes, it is all strange to us, but it cannot be otherwise. You see, if  we knew all about what we really are and what our past has been, mortal  experiences would not be the test or the school that Father intends it  to be.\"    \"That is true; but think of being shut out, even in our thoughts, from  this world. And then, I hear that down on earth there will be much sin  and misery, and a power to tempt and lead astray. O, if we can but  resist it, dear brother. What will this power be, do you know?\"    \"I have only my thoughts about it. I know nothing for a certainty; but  fear not, something will prompt us to the right, and we have this hope  that Father's Spirit will not forsake us. And above all, our Elder  Brother has been accepted as an offering for all the sins we may do. He  will come to us in purity, and with power to loose the bands of death.  He will bring to us Father's law whereby we may overcome the world and  its sin.\"    \"You said the bands of death. What is death?\"    \"Death is simply the losing of our earthly tabernacles for a time. We  shall be separated from them, but the promise is that our Elder Brother  will be given power to raise them up again. With them again united, we  shall become even as our parents are now, eternal, perfected,  celestialized beings.\"    As they conversed, both faces shone with a soft, beautiful light. The  joy within was traced on their countenances, and for some time it was  too deep for words. Homan was drawn to this beautiful sister. All were  pleasing to his eye, but he was unusually attracted to one who took such  pleasure in talking about matters nearest his heart.    \"I must be going,\" said she.    \"May I go with you?\"    \"Come.\"    They wandered silently among the people, then out through the  surrounding gardens, listening to the music. Instinctively, they clung  to each other, nor bestowed more than a smile or a word on passing  brother or sister.    \"What do you think of Lucifer and his plan?\" asked she.    \"The talented Son of the Morning is in danger of being cast out if he  persists in his course. As to his plan, it is this: 'If I cannot rule, I  will ruin.'\"    \"And if he rule, it will still be ruin, it seems to me.\"    \"True; and he is gaining power over many.\"    \"Yes; he has talked with me. He is a bewitching person; but his  fascination has something strange about it which I do not like.\"    \"I am glad of that.\"    She looked quickly at him, and then they gazed again into each other's  eyes.    \"By what name may I call you?\" he asked.    \"My name is Delsa.\"    \"Will you tell me where you live? May I come and talk with you again? It  will give me much pleasure.\"    \"Which pleasure will be mutual,\" said she.    They parted at the junction of two paths.          II.      \"How art thou fallen from heaven, O, Lucifer, son of the    morning.\"--_Isaiah 14:12._      Never before in the experiences of the intelligences of heaven, had such  dire events been foreshadowed. A crisis was certainly at hand. Lucifer  was fast gaining influence among the spirits--and they had their agency  to follow whom they would. The revolting spirit had skill in argument;  and the light-minded, the discontented, and the rebellious were won  over.    To be assured eternal glory and power without an effort on their part,  appealed to them as something to be desired. To be untrammeled with  laws, to be free to act at pleasure, without jeopardizing their future  welfare, certainly was an attractive proposition. The pleasures in the  body would be of a nature hitherto unknown. Why not be free to enjoy  them? Why this curb on the passions and desires? \"Hail to Lucifer and  his plan! We will follow him. He is in the right.\"    Many of the mighty and noble children of God arrayed themselves on the  side of Christ, their Elder Brother, and waged war against Lucifer's  pernicious doctrine. One of the foremost among them was Michael. He was  unceasing in his"]]]
