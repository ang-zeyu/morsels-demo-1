I have  pleaded with my uncle in your behalf, but in vain.\"    Florence was too clear-sighted not to penetrate his falsehood.    \"If my uncle's heart is hardened against me,\" she said, \"I shall be  too wise to turn to you. I am to understand, then, that my choice lies  between poverty and a union with you?\"    \"You have stated it correctly, Florence.\"    \"Then,\" said Florence, arising, \"I will not hesitate. I shrink from  poverty, for I have been reared in luxury, but I will sooner live in  a hovel--\"    \"Or a tenement house,\" interjected Curtis, with a sneer.    \"Yes, or a tenement house, than become the wife of one I loathe.\"    \"Girl, you shall bitterly repent that word!\" said Curtis, stung to  fury.    She did not reply, but, pale and sorrowful, glided from the room to  weep bitter tears in the seclusion of her chamber.          Chapter II.  A Stranger Visitor.      Curtis Waring followed the retreating form of his cousin with a  sardonic smile.    \"She is in the toils! She cannot escape me!\" he muttered. \"But\"--and  here his brow darkened--\"it vexes me to see how she repels my  advances, as if I were some loathsome thing! If only she would return  my love--for I do love her, cold as she is--I should be happy. Can  there be a rival? But no! we live so quietly that she has met no one  who could win her affection. Why can she not turn to me? Surely, I am  not so ill-favored, and though twice her age, I am still a young man.  Nay, it is only a young girl's caprice. She shall yet come to my arms,  a willing captive.\"    His thoughts took a turn, as he arose from his seat, and walked over  to the secretary.    \"So it is here that the two wills are deposited!\" he said to himself;  \"one making me a rich man, the other a beggar! While the last is in  existence I am not safe. The boy may be alive, and liable to turn up  at any moment. If only he were dead--or the will destroyed----\" Here  he made a suggestive pause.    He took a bunch of keys from his pocket, and tried one after another,  but without success. He was so absorbed in his work that he did not  notice the entrance of a dark-browed, broad-shouldered man, dressed in  a shabby corduroy suit, till the intruder indulged in a short cough,  intended to draw attention.    Starting with guilty consciousness, Curtis turned sharply around, and  his glance fell on the intruder.    \"Who are you?\" he demanded, angrily. \"And how dare you enter a  gentleman's house unbidden?\"    \"Are you the gentleman?\" asked the intruder, with intentional  insolence.    \"Yes.\"    \"You own this house?\"    \"Not at present. It is my uncle's.\"    \"And that secretary--pardon my curiosity--is his?\"    \"Yes; but what business is it of yours?\"    \"Not much. Only it makes me laugh to see a gentleman picking a lock.  You should leave such business to men like me!\"    \"You are an insolent fellow!\" said Curtis, more embarrassed than he  liked to confess, for this rough-looking man had become possessed of a  dangerous secret. \"I am my uncle's confidential agent, and it was on  business of his that I wished to open the desk.\"    \"Why not go to him for the key?\"    \"Because he is sick. But, pshaw! why should I apologize or give any  explanation to you? What can you know of him or me?\"    \"More, perhaps, than you suspect,\" said the intruder, quietly.    \"Then, you know, perhaps, that I am my uncle's heir?\"    \"Don't be too sure of that.\"    \"Look here, fellow,\" said Curtis, thoroughly provoked, \"I don't know  who you are nor what you mean, but let me inform you that your  presence here is an intrusion, and the sooner you leave the house the  better!\"    \"I will leave it when I get ready.\"    Curtis started to his feet, and advanced to his visitor with an air of  menace.    \"Go at once,\" he exclaimed, angrily, \"or I will kick you out of the  door!\"    \"What's the matter with the window?\" returned the stranger, with an  insolent leer.    \"That's as you prefer, but if you don't leave at once I will eject  you.\"    By way of reply, the rough visitor coolly seated himself in a  luxurious easy-chair, and, looking up into the angry face of Waring,  said:    \"Oh, no, you won't.\"    \"And why not, may I ask?\" said Curtis, with a feeling of uneasiness  for which he could not account.    \"Why not? Because, in that case, I should seek an interview with your  uncle, and tell him----\"    \"What?\"    \"That his son still lives; and that I can restore him to his----\"    The face of Curtis Waring blanched; he staggered as if he had been  struck; and he cried out, hoarsely:    \"It is a lie!\"    \"It is the truth, begging your pardon. Do you mind my smoking?\" and he  coolly produced a common clay pipe, filled and lighted it.    \"Who are you?\" asked Curtis, scanning the man's features with painful  anxiety.    \"Have you forgotten Tim Bolton?\"    \"Are you Tim Bolton?\" faltered Curtis.    \"Yes; but you don't seem glad to see me?\"    \"I thought you were----\"    \"In Australia. So I was three years since. Then I got homesick, and  came back to New York.\"    \"You have been here three years?\"    \"Yes,\" chuckled Bolton. \"You didn't suspect it, did you?\"    \"Where?\" asked Curtis, in a hollow voice.    \"I keep a saloon on the Bowery. There's my card. Call around when  convenient.\"    Curtis was about to throw the card into the grate, but on second  thought dropped it into his pocket.    \"And the boy?\" he asked, slowly.    \"Is alive and well. He hasn't been starved. Though I dare say you  wouldn't have grieved if he had.\"    \"And he is actually in this city?\"    \"Just so.\"    \"Does he know anything of--you know what I mean.\"    \"He doesn't know that he is the son of a rich man, and heir to the  property which you look upon as yours. That's what you mean, isn't  it?\"    \"Yes. What is he doing? Is he at work?\"    \"He helps me some in the saloon, sells papers in the evenings, and  makes himself generally useful.\"    \"Has he any education?\"    \"Well, I haven't sent him to boarding school or college,\" answered  Tim. \"He don't know no Greek, or Latin, or mathematics--phew, that's a  hard word. You didn't tell me you wanted him made a scholar of.\"    \"I didn't. I wanted never to see or hear from him again. What made you  bring him back to New York?\"    \"Couldn't keep away, governor. I got homesick, I did. There ain't but  one Bowery in the world, and I hankered after that----\"    \"Didn't I pay you money to keep away, Tim Bolton?\"    \"I don't deny it; but what's three thousand dollars? Why, the kid's  cost me more than that. I've had the care of him for fourteen years,  and it's only about two hundred a year.\"    \"You have broken your promise to me!\" said Curtis, sternly.    \"There's worse things than breaking your promise,\" retorted Bolton.    Scarcely had he spoken than a change came over his face, and he stared  open-mouthed behind him and beyond Curtis.    Startled himself, Curtis turned, and saw, with a feeling akin to  dismay, the tall figure of his uncle standing on the threshold of the  left portal, clad in a morning gown, with his eyes fixed inquiringly  upon Bolton and himself.          Chapter III.  An Unholy Compact.      \"Who is that man, Curtis?\" asked John Linden, pointing his thin finger  at Tim Bolton, who looked strangely out of place, as, with clay pipe,  he sat in the luxurious library on a sumptuous chair.    \"That man?\" stammered Curtis, quite at a loss what to say.    \"Yes.\"    \"He is a poor man out of luck, who has applied to me for assistance,\"  answered Curtis, recovering his wits.    \"That's it, governor,\" said Bolton, thinking it necessary to confirm  the statement. \"I've got five small children at home almost starvin',  your honor.\"    \"That is sad. What is your business, my man?\"    It was Bolton's turn to be embarrassed.    \"My business?\" he repeated.    \"That is what I said.\"    \"I'm a blacksmith, but I'm willing to do any honest work.\"    \"That is commendable; but don't you know that it is very ill-bred to  smoke a pipe in a gentleman's house?\"    \"Excuse me, governor!\"    And Bolton extinguished his pipe, and put it away in a pocket of his  corduroy coat.    \"I was just telling him the same thing,\" said Curtis. \"Don't trouble  yourself any further, uncle. I will inquire into the man's  circumstances, and help him if I can.\"    \"Very well, Curtis. I came down because I thought I heard voices.\"    John Linden slowly returned to his chamber, and left the two alone.    \"The governor's getting old,\" said Bolton. \"When I was butler here,  fifteen years ago, he looked like a young man. He didn't suspect that  he had ever seen me before.\"    \"Nor that you had carried away his son, Bolton.\"    \"Who hired me to do it? Who put me up to the job, as far as that  goes?\"    \"Hush! Walls have ears. Let us return to business.\"    \"That suits me.\"    \"Look here, Tim Bolton,\" said Curtis, drawing up a chair, and lowering  his voice to a confidential pitch, \"you say you want money?\"    \"Of course I do.\"    \"Well, I don't give money for nothing.\"    \"I know that. What's wanted now?\"    \"You say the boy is alive?\"    \"He's very much alive.\"    \"Is there any necessity for his living?\" asked Curtis, in a sharp,  hissing tone, fixing his eyes searchingly on Bolton, to see how his  hint would be taken.    \"You mean that you want me to murder him?\" said Bolton, quickly.    \"Why not? You don't look over scrupulous.\"    \"I am a bad man, I admit it,\" said Bolton, with a gesture of  repugnance, \"a thief, a low blackguard, perhaps, but, thank Heaven! I  am no murderer! And if I was, I wouldn't spill a drop of that boy's  blood for the fortune that is his by right.\"    \"I didn't give you credit for so much sentiment, Bolton,\" said Curtis,  with a sneer. \"You don't look like it, but appearances are deceitful.  We'll drop the subject. You can serve me in another way. Can you open  this secretary?\"    \"Yes; that's in my line.\"    \"There is a paper in it that I want. It is my uncle's will. I have a  curiosity to read "]]]
