Over it is a cylindrical tympanum,  or a smooth flagstone, bearing sometimes merely the name of the dead  person, sometimes his titles and descent, sometimes a prayer for his  welfare, and an enumeration of the days during which he was entitled to  receive the worship due to ancestors. They invoked on his behalf, and  almost always precisely in the same words, the \"Great God,\" the Osiris  of Mendes, or else Anubis, dwelling in the Divine Palace, that burial  might be granted to him in Amentit, the land of the West, the very great  and very good, to him the vassal of the Great God; that he might walk  in the ways in which it is good to walk, he the vassal of the Great  God; that he might have offerings of bread, cakes, and drink, at the New  Year's Feast, at the feast of Thot, on the first day of the year, on the  feast of Uagait, at the great fire festival, at the procession of the  god Minu, at the feast of offerings, at the monthly and half-monthly  festivals, and every day.    [Illustration: 008.jpg TETINIONKHU, SITTING BEFORE THE FUNERAL REPAST]         Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph of the original monument       which is preserved in the Liverpool Museum; cf. Gatty,       _Catalogue of the Mayer Collection;_ I. Egyptian       Antiquities, No. 294, p. 45.    The chapel is usually small, and is almost lost in the great extent  of the building.* It generally consists merely of an oblong chamber,  approached by a rather short passage.**         * Thus the chapel of the mastaba of Sabu is only 14 ft. 4       in. long, by about 3 ft. 3 in. deep, and that of the tomb of       Phtahshopsisu, 10 ft. 4 in. by 3 ft. 7 in.         ** The mastaba of Tinti has four chambers, as has also that       of Assi-onkhu; but these are exceptions, as may be       ascertained by consulting the work of Mariette. Most of       those which contain several rooms are ancient one-roomed       mastabas, which have been subsequently altered or enlarged;       this is the case with the mastabas of Shopsi and of       Ankhaftuka. A few, however, were constructed from the outset       with all their apartments--that of Raonkhumai, with six       chambers and several niches; that of Khabiuphtah, with three       chambers, niches, and doorway ornamented with two pillars;       that of Ti, with two chambers, a court surrounded with       pillars, a doorway, and long inscribed passages; and that of       Phtahhotpu, with seven chambers, besides niches.    [Illustration: 009.jpg THE FACADE AND THE STELE OF THE TOMB OF  PHTAHSHOPSISU AT SAQQARA]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Duhichen.    At the far end, and set back into the western wall, is a huge  quadrangular stele, at the foot of which is seen the table of offerings,  made of alabaster, granite or limestone placed flat upon the ground,  and sometimes two little obelisks or two altars, hollowed at the top to  receive the gifts mentioned in the inscription on the exterior of the  tomb. The general appearance is that of a rather low, narrow doorway,  too small to be a practicable entrance. The recess thus formed is almost  always left empty; sometimes, however, the piety of relatives placed  within it a statue of the deceased. Standing there, with shoulders  thrown back, head erect, and smiling face, the statue seems to step  forth to lead the double from its dark lodging where it lies embalmed,  to those glowing plains where he dwelt in freedom during his earthly  life: another moment, crossing the threshold, he must descend the few  steps leading into the public hall. On festivals and days of offering,  when the priest and family presented the banquet with the customary  rites, this great painted figure, in the act of advancing, and seen  by the light of flickering torches or smoking lamps, might well appear  endued with life. It was as if the dead ancestor himself stepped out of  the wall and mysteriously stood before his descendants to claim their  homage. The inscription on the lintel repeats once more the name and  rank of the dead. Faithful portraits of him and of other members of his  family figure in the bas-reliefs on the door-posts.    [Illustration: 010.jpg STELE IN THE FORM OF A DOOR]    The little scene at the far end represents him seated tranquilly at  table, with the details of the feast carefully recorded at his side,  from the first moment when water is brought to him for ablution, to that  when, all culinary skill being exhausted, he has but to return to his  dwelling, in a state of beatified satisfaction. The stele represented to  the visitor the door leading to the private apartments of the deceased;  the fact of its being walled up for ever showing that no living mortal  might cross its threshold. The inscription which covered its surface was  not a mere epitaph informing future generations who it was that reposed  beneath. It perpetuated the name and genealogy of the deceased, and  gave him a civil status, without which he could not have preserved his  personality in the world beyond; the nameless dead, like a living man  without a name, was reckoned as non-existing. Nor was this the only use  of the stele; the pictures and prayers inscribed upon it acted as so  many talismans for ensuring the continuous existence of the ancestor,  whose memory they recalled. They compelled the god therein invoked,  whether Osiris or the jackal Anubis, to act as mediator between the  living and the departed; they granted to the god the enjoyment of  sacrifices and those good things abundantly offered to the deities, and  by which they live, on condition that a share of them might first be  set aside for the deceased. By the divine favour, the soul or rather the  doubles of the bread, meat, and beverages passed into the other world,  and there refreshed the human double. It was not, however, necessary  that the offering should have a material existence, in order to be  effective; the first comer who should repeat aloud the name and the  formulas inscribed upon the stone, secured for the unknown occupant, by  this means alone, the immediate possession of all the things which he  enumerated.    The stele constitutes the essential part of the chapel and tomb. In many  cases it was the only inscribed portion, it alone being necessary to  ensure the identity and continuous existence of the dead man; often,  however, the sides of the chamber and passage were not left bare. When  time or the wealth of the owner permitted, they were covered with scenes  and writing, expressing at greater length the ideas summarized by the  figures and inscriptions of the stele.    [Illustration: 014.jpg A REPRESENTATION OF THE DOMAINS OF THE LORD TI,  BRINGING TO HIM OFFERINGS IN PROCESSION]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin taken from a \"squeeze\" taken from the       tomb of Ti. The domains are represented as women. The name       is written before each figure with the designation of the       landowner.      Neither pictorial effect nor the caprice of the moment was permitted  to guide the artist in the choice of his subjects; all that he drew,  pictures or words, bad a magical purpose. Every individual who built for  himself an \"eternal house,\" either attached to it a staff of priests  of the double, of inspectors, scribes, and slaves, or else made an  agreement with the priests of a neighbouring temple to serve the chapel  in perpetuity. Lands taken from his patrimony, which thus became the  \"Domains of the Eternal House,\" rewarded them for their trouble, and  supplied them with meats, vegetables, fruits, liquors, linen and vessels  for sacrifice.    [Illustration: 015.jpg THE REPRESENTATION OF THE LORD TI ASSISTING AT  THE PRELIMINARIES OF THE SACRIFICE AND OFFERINGS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Dumichen,       Besultate, vol. i. pl. 13.    In theory, these \"liturgies\" were perpetuated from year to year, until  the end of time; but in practice, after three or four generations, the  older ancestors were forsaken for those who had died more recently.  Notwithstanding the imprecations and threats of the donor against the  priests who should neglect their duty, or against those who should usurp  the funeral endowments, sooner or later there came a time when, forsaken  by all, the double was in danger of perishing for want of sustenance. In  order to ensure that the promised gifts, offered in substance on the day  of burial, should be maintained throughout the centuries, the relatives  not only depicted them upon the chapel walls, but represented in  addition the lands which produced them, and the labour which contributed  to their production. On one side we see ploughing, sowing, reaping, the  carrying of the corn, the storing of the grain, the fattening of the  poultry, and the driving of the cattle. A little further on, workmen of  all descriptions are engaged in their several trades: shoemakers ply  the awl, glassmakers blow through their tubes, metal founders watch over  their smelting-pots, carpenters hew down trees and build a ship; groups  of women weave or spin under the eye of a frowning taskmaster, who seems  impatient of their chatter. Did the double in his hunger desire meat? He  might choose from the pictures on the wall the animal that pleased him  best, whether kid, ox, or gazelle; he might follow the course of its  life, from its birth in the meadows to the slaughter-house and the  kitchen, and might satisfy his hunger with its flesh. The double saw  himself represented in the paintings as hunting, and to the hunt he  went; he was painted eating and drinking with his wife, and he ate and  drank with her; the pictured ploughing, harvesting, and gathering into  barns, thus became to him actual realities. In fine, this painted world  of men and things represented upon the wall was quickened by the same  life which animated the double, upon whom it all depended: the _picture_  of a meal or of a slave was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17323"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 3 (of 12) (#2)"],[1,"ual, formidable; he  installed himself therein, tied the four reins to the side, and darted  forth, pitiless, torrent-like, swift.\"         * Sayce was the first, I believe, to cite, in connection       with this mysterious order, the passage in which Berossus       tells how the gods created men from a little clay, moistened       with the blood of the god Belos. Here there seems to be a       fear lest the blood of Tiamat, mingling with the mud, should       produce a crop of monsters similar to those which the       goddess had already created; the blood, if carried to the       north, into the domain of the night, would there lose its       creative power, or the monsters who might spring from it       would at any rate remain strangers to the world of gods and       men.         ** \"Literally, he made his weapon known; \"perhaps it would       be better to interpret it, \"and he made it known that the       bow would henceforth be his distinctive weapon.\"    [Illustration: 008.jpg BEL-MERODACH, ARMED WITH THE THUNDERBOLT, DOES  BATTLE WITH THE TUMULTUOUS TIAMAT.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin from the bas-relief from Nimrud       preserved in the British Museum.    He passed through the serried ranks of the monsters and penetrated as  far as Tiamat, and provoked her with his cries. \"'Thou hast rebelled  against the sovereignty of the gods, thou hast plotted evil against  them, and hast desired that my fathers should taste of thy malevolence;  therefore thy host shall be reduced to slavery, thy weapons shall be  torn from thee. Come, then, thou and I must give battle to one another!'  Tiamat, when she heard him, flew into a fury, she became mad with rage;  then Tiamat howled, she raised herself savagely to her full height, and  planted her feet firmly on the earth. She pronounced an incantation,  recited her formula, and called to her aid the gods of the combat,  both them and their weapons. They drew near one to another, Tiamat and  Marduk, wisest of the gods: They flung themselves into the combat, they  met one another in the struggle. Then the master unfolded his net and  seized her; he caused the hurricane which waited behind him to pass  in front of him, and, when Tiamat opened her mouth to swallow him, he  thrust the hurricane into it so that the monster could not close her  jaws again. The mighty wind filled her paunch, her breast swelled, her  maw was split. Marduk gave a straight thrust with his lance, burst  open the paunch, pierced the interior, tore the breast, then bound the  monster and deprived her of life. When he had vanquished Tiamat, who had  been their leader, her army was disbanded, her host was scattered, and  the gods, her allies, who had marched beside her, trembled, were scared,  and fled.\" He seized hold of them, and of Kingu their chief, and brought  them bound in chains before the throne of his father.    He had saved the gods from ruin, but this was the least part of  his task; he had still to sweep out of space the huge carcase which  encumbered it, and to separate its ill-assorted elements, and arrange  them afresh for the benefit of the conquerors. He returned to Tiamat  whom he had bound in chains. He placed his foot upon her, with his  unerring knife he cut into the upper part of her; then he cut the  blood-vessels, and caused the blood to be carried by the north wind to  the hidden places. And the gods saw his face, they rejoiced, they gave  themselves up to gladness, and sent him a present, a tribute of peace;  then he recovered his calm, he contemplated the corpse, raised it and  wrought marvels.    [Illustration: 010.jpg A KUFA LADEN WITH STONES, AND MANNED BY A CREW OF  FOUR MEN.]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief at Koyunjik.       Behind the _kufa_ may be seen a fisherman seated astride on       an inflated skin with his fish-basket attached to his neck.    He split it in two as one does a fish for drying; then he hung up one of  the halves on high, which became the heavens; the other half he spread  out under his feet to form the earth, and made the universe such as  men have since known it. As in Egypt, the world was a kind of enclosed  chamber balanced on the bosom of the eternal waters.* The earth, which  forms the lower part of it, or floor, is something like an overturned  boat in appearance, and hollow underneath, not like one of the narrow  skiffs in use among other races, but a kufa, or kind of semicircular  boat such as the tribes of the Lower Euphrates have made use of from  earliest antiquity down to our own times.         * The description of the Egyptian world will be found in       vol. i. p. 21 of the present work. So far the only       systematic attempt to reconstruct the Chaldaean world, since       Lenormant, has been made by Jensen, who, after examining all       the elements which went to compose it, one after another,       sums up in a few pages, and reproduces in a plate, the       principal results of his inquiry. It will be seen at a       glance how much I have taken from his work, and in what       respects the drawing here reproduced differs from his.    [Illustration: 012.jpg THE WORLD AS CONCEIVED BY THE CHALDAEANS]    The earth rises gradually from the extremities to the centre, like a  great mountain, of which the snow-region, where the Euphrates finds its  source, approximately marks the summit. It was at first supposed to be  divided into seven zones, placed one on the top of the other along its  sides, like the stories of a temple; later on it was divided into four  \"houses,\" each of which, like the \"houses\" of Egypt, corresponded with  one of the four cardinal points, and was under the rule of particular  gods. Near the foot of the mountain, the edges of the so-called boat  curve abruptly outwards, and surround the earth with a continuous wall  of uniform height having no opening. The waters accumulated in the  hollow thus formed, as in a ditch; it was a narrow and mysterious sea,  an ocean stream, which no living man might cross save with permission  from on high, and whose waves rigorously separated the domain of men  from the regions reserved to the gods. The heavens rose above the  \"mountain of the world\" like a boldly formed dome, the circumference  of which rested on the top of the wall in the same way as the upper  structures of a house rest on its foundations. Merodach wrought it out  of a hard resisting metal which shone brilliantly during the day in  the rays of the sun, and at night appeared only as a dark blue surface,  strewn irregularly with luminous stars. He left it quite solid in the  southern regions, but tunnelled it in the north, by contriving within  it a huge cavern which communicated with external space by means of two  doors placed at the east and the west.* The sun came forth each morning  by the first of these doors; he mounted to the zenith, following the  internal base of the cupola from east to south; then he slowly descended  again to the western door, and re-entered the tunnel in the firmament,  where he spent the night,** Merodach regulated the course of the whole  universe on the movements of the sun. He instituted the year and divided  it into twelve months. To each month he assigned three decans, each of  whom exercised his influence successively for a period of ten days; he  then placed the procession of the days under the authority of Nibiru,  in order that none of them should wander from his track and be lost. \"He  lighted the moon that she might rule the night, and made her a star of  night that she might indicate the days:*** 'From month to month, without  ceasing, shape thy disk,**** and at the beginning of the month kindle  thyself in the evening, lighting up thy horns so as to make the heavens  distinguishable; on the seventh day, show to me thy disk; and on the  fifteenth, let thy two halves be full from month to month.'\" He cleared  a path for the planets, and four of them he entrusted to four gods; the  fifth, our Jupiter, he reserved for himself, and appointed him to be  shepherd of this celestial flock; in order that all the gods might have  their image visible in the sky, he mapped out on the vault of heaven  groups of stars which he allotted to them, and which seemed to men like  representations of real or fabulous beings, fishes with the heads of  rams, lions, bulls, goats and scorpions.         * Jensen has made a collection of the texts which speak of       the interior of the heavens (Kirib shami) and of their       aspect. The expressions which have induced many       Assyriologists to conclude that the heavens were divided       into different parts subject to different gods may be       explained without necessarily having recourse to this       hypothesis; the \"heaven of Ami,\" for instance, is an       expression which merely affirms Anu's sovereignty in the       heavens, and is only a more elegant way of designating the       heavens by the name of the god who rules them. The gates of       heaven are mentioned in the account of the Creation.         ** It is generally admitted that the Chaldaeans believed that       the sun passed over the world in the daytime, and underneath       it during the night. The general resemblance of their theory       of the universe to the Egyptian theory leads me to believe       that they, no less than the Egyptians (cf. vol. i. pp. 24,       25, of the present work), for along time believed that the       sun and moon revolved round the earth in a horizontal plane.         *** This obscure phrase seems to be explained, if we       remember that the Chaldaean, like the Egyptian day, dated       from the rising of one moon to the rising of the following       moon; for instance, from six o'clock one evening to about       six o'clock the next evening. The moon, the star of night,       thus marks the appearance of each day and \"indicates the       days.\"         **** The word here translated by \"disk\" is literally the    "]]]
