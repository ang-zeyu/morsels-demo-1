As long as my mother lived she was my severest critic, never  satisfied. Finally I became such for myself. Now fifteen years more  have passed, of which I spent eight very exacting ones as a dramatic  singer in America, afterward fulfilling engagements as a star, in all  languages, in Germany, Austria, Hungary, France, England, and Sweden.  My study of singing, nevertheless, was not relaxed. I kept it up more  and more zealously by myself, learned something from everybody,  learned to _hear_ myself and others.    For many years I have been devoting myself to the important questions  relating to singing, and believe that I have finally found what I have  been seeking. It has been my endeavor to set down as clearly as  possible all that I have learned through zealous, conscientious study  by myself and with others, and thereby to offer to my colleagues  something that will bring order into the chaos of their methods of  singing; something based on science as well as on sensations in  singing; something that will bring expressions often misunderstood  into clear relation with the exact functions of the vocal organs.    In what I have just said I wish to give a sketch of my career only to  show what my voice has endured, and why, notwithstanding the enormous  demands I have made upon it, it has lasted so well. One who has sung  for a short time, and then has lost his voice, and for this reason  becomes a singing teacher, has never sung consciously; it has simply  been an accident, and this accident will be repeated, for good or for  ill, in his pupils.    The talent in which all the requirements of an artist are united is  very rare. Real talent will get along, even with an inferior teacher,  in some way or another; while the best teacher cannot produce talent  where there is none. Such a teacher, however, will not beguile people  with promises that cannot be kept.    My chief attention I devote to artists, whom I can, perhaps, assist in  their difficult, but glorious, profession. One is never done with  learning; and that is especially true of singers. I earnestly hope  that I may leave them something, in my researches, experiences, and  studies, that will be of use. I regard it as my duty; and I confide it  to all who are striving earnestly for improvement.    GRUeNEWALD, Oct. 31, 1900.          SECTION I    PRELIMINARY PRACTICE      It is very important for all who wish to become artists to begin their  work not with practical exercises in singing, but with serious  practice in tone production, in breathing in and out, in the functions  of the lungs and palate, in clear pronunciation of all letters, and  with speech in general.    Then it would soon be easy to recognize talent or the lack of it. Many  would open their eyes in wonder over the difficulties of learning to  sing, and the proletariat of singers would gradually disappear. With  them would go the singing conservatories and the bad teachers who, for  a living, teach everybody that comes, and promise to make everybody a  great artist.    Once when I was acting as substitute for a teacher in a conservatory,  the best pupils of the institution were promised me,--those who needed  only the finishing touches. But when, after my first lesson, I went to  the director and complained of the ignorance of the pupils, my mouth  was closed with these words, \"For Heaven's sake, don't say such  things, or we could never keep our conservatory going!\"    I had enough, and went.    The best way is for pupils to learn preparatory books by heart, and  make drawings. In this way they will get the best idea of the vocal  organs, and learn their functions by sensation as soon as they begin  to sing. The pupil should be subjected to strict examinations.    _In what does artistic singing differ from natural singing?_    In a clear understanding of all the organs concerned in voice  production, and their functions, singly and together; in the  understanding of the sensations in singing, conscientiously studied  and scientifically explained; in a gradually cultivated power of  contracting and relaxing the muscles of the vocal organs, that power  culminating in the ability to submit them to severe exertions and keep  them under control. The prescribed tasks must be mastered so that they  can be done without exertion, with the whole heart and soul, and with  complete understanding.    How is this to be attained?    Through natural gifts, among which I reckon the possession of sound  organs and a well-favored body; through study guided by an excellent  teacher _who can sing well himself_,--study that must be kept up for  at least six years, without counting the preliminary work.    Only singers formed on such a basis, after years of work, deserve the  title of artist; only such have a right to look forward to a lasting  future, and only those equipped with such a knowledge ought to teach.    _Of what consists artistic singing?_    Of a clear understanding, first and foremost, of breathing, in and  out; of an understanding of the form through which the breath has to  flow, prepared by a proper position of the larynx, the tongue, and the  palate. Of a knowledge and understanding of the functions of the  muscles of the abdomen and diaphragm, which regulate the breath  pressure; then, of the chest-muscle tension, against which the breath  is forced, and whence, under the control of the singer, after passing  through the vocal cords, it beats against the resonating surfaces and  vibrates in the cavities of the head. Of a highly cultivated skill and  flexibility in adjusting all the vocal organs and in putting them into  minutely graduated movements, without inducing changes through the  pronunciation of words or the execution of musical figures that shall  be injurious to the tonal beauty or the artistic expression of the  song. Of an immense muscular power in the breathing apparatus and all  the vocal organs, the strengthening of which to endure sustained  exertion cannot be begun too long in advance; and the exercising of  which, as long as one sings in public, must never be remitted for a  single day.    As beauty and stability of tone do not depend upon excessive  _pressure_ of the breath, so the muscular power of the organs used in  singing does not depend on convulsive rigidity, but in that snakelike  power of contracting and loosening,[1] which a singer must consciously  have under perfect control.    [Footnote 1: In physiology when the muscles resume their normal state,  they are said to be _relaxed_. But as I wish to avoid giving a false  conception in our vocal sensations, I prefer to use the word  \"loosening.\"]    The study needed for this occupies an entire lifetime; not only  because the singer must perfect himself more and more in the roles of  his repertory--even after he has been performing them year in and year  out,--but because he must continually strive for progress, setting  himself tasks that require greater and greater mastery and strength,  and thereby demand fresh study.    _He who stands still, goes backward._    Nevertheless, there are fortunately gifted geniuses in whom are  already united all the qualities needed to attain greatness and  perfection, and whose circumstances in life are equally fortunate; who  can reach the goal earlier, without devoting their whole lives to it.  Thus, for instance, in Adelina Patti everything was united,--the  splendid voice, paired with great talent for singing, and the long  oversight of her studies by her distinguished teacher, Strakosch. She  never sang roles that did not suit her voice; in her earlier years she  sang only arias and duets or single solos, never taking part in  ensembles. She never sang even her limited repertory when she was  indisposed. She never attended rehearsals, but came to the theatre in  the evening and sang triumphantly, without ever having seen the  persons who sang and acted with her. She spared herself rehearsals  which, on the day of the performance, or the day before, exhaust all  singers, because of the excitement of all kinds attending them, and  which contribute neither to the freshness of the voice nor to the joy  of the profession.    Although she was a Spaniard by birth and an American by early  adoption, she was, so to speak, the greatest Italian singer of my  time. All was absolutely good, correct, and flawless, the voice like a  bell that you seemed to hear long after its singing had ceased.    Yet she could give no explanation of her art, and answered all her  colleagues' questions concerning it with an \"Ah, je n'en sais rien!\"    She possessed, unconsciously, as a gift of nature, a union of all  those qualities that all other singers must attain and possess  _consciously_. Her vocal organs stood in the most favorable relations  to each other. Her talent, and her remarkably trained ear, maintained  control over the beauty of her singing and of her voice. The fortunate  circumstances of her life preserved her from all injury. The purity  and flawlessness of her tone, the beautiful equalization of her whole  voice, constituted the magic by which she held her listeners  entranced. Moreover, she was beautiful and gracious in appearance.    The accent of great dramatic power she did not possess; yet I ascribe  this more to her intellectual indolence than to her lack of ability.          SECTION II    OF THE BREATH      The breath becomes voice through the operation of the will, and the  instrumentality of the vocal organs.    To regulate the breath, to prepare a passage of the proper form  through which it shall flow, circulate, develop itself, and reach the  necessary resonating chambers, must be our chief task.    Concerning the breath and much more besides there is so much that is  excellent in Oscar Guttmann's \"Gymnastik der Stimme\" that I can do no  better"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],[0,"Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#2)"],[1,"hearing excellent singing and speaking. Yet many  singers had their voices ruined in the training, and their success as  vocalists made impossible; while others, a little less unfortunate,  were still handicapped through life by the injury done by mistaken  methods in early years. Jenny Lind's perfect vocal organs were quite  disabled at twelve years of age by wrong methods, and they recovered  only after a protracted season of rest. As a consequence her beautiful  voice began to fail long before her splendid physique, and long before  her years demanded. Singers taught in nature's way should be able to  sing so long as strength lasts, and, like Adelaide Phillips, Carl  Formes, and Sims Reeves, sing their sweetest songs in the declining  years of life. Martel, at seventy years of age, had a full, rich  voice. He focused all his tones alike, and employed deep abdominal  breathing.    The whole matter of voice training has been clouded by controversy.  The strident advocates of various systems, each of them \"the only true  method,\" have in their disputes overcast the subject with much that is  irrelevant, thus obscuring its essential simplicity.    The \"scientific\" teachers, at one extreme, have paid too exclusive  attention to the mechanics of the voice. The \"empiricists\" have gone  to the other extreme in leaving out of account fundamental facts in  acoustics, physiology, and psychology.    The truth is that no purely human function, especially one so subtle  as singing, can be developed mechanically; nor, on the other hand, can  the mere _ipse dixit_ of any teacher satisfy the demands of the modern  spirit.      PRINCIPLES ADVOCATED    The positions here advocated, because they seem both rational and  simple, are:    =1. That the singing and speaking tones are identical, produced by the  same organs in the same way, and developed by the same training.=    =2. That breathing is, for the singer, only an amplification of the  correct daily habit.=    =3. That \"registers\" are a myth.=    =4. That \"head tones, chest tones, closed tones, open tones,\" etc., as  confined to special parts of the range of the voice, are distracting  distinctions arising from false education.=    =5. That resonance determines the quality and carrying power of every  tone, and is therefore the most important element in the study and  training of the voice.=    =6. That the obstacles to good speaking and singing are psychologic  rather than physiologic.=    =7. That, in the nature of things, the right way is always an easy  way.=          CHAPTER I    THE VOCAL INSTRUMENT      Since the vocal organism first became an object of systematic study,  discussion has been constant as to whether the human vocal instrument  is a stringed instrument, a reed instrument, or a whistle. Discussion  of the question seems futile, for practically it is all of these and  more. The human vocal organs form an instrument, _sui generis_, which  cannot be compared with any other one thing. Not only is it far more  complex than any other instrument, being capable, as it is, of  imitating nearly every instrument in the catalogue and almost every  sound in nature, but it is incomparably more beautiful, an instrument  so universally superior to any made by man that comparisons and  definitions fail.      ELEMENTS    The human vocal instrument has the three elements common to all  musical instruments,--a motor, a vibrator, and a resonator; to which  is added--what all other instruments lack--an articulator.    1. The respiratory muscles and lungs for a =motor=.    2. The vocal cords for a =vibrator=.    3. The throat, mouth, and the nasal and head cavities for a =resonator=.    4. The tongue, lips, teeth, and palate for an =articulator=.    These elements appear in as great a variety of size and proportion as  do the variations of individual humanity, and each element is,  moreover, variable according to the will or feeling of the individual.  This susceptibility to change constitutes a modifying power which  gives a variety in tone quality possible to no other instrument and  makes it our wonder and admiration. The modification and interaction  of these various parts produced by the emotions of the singer or  speaker give qualities of tone expressive of the feelings, as of pain  or pleasure, grief or joy, courage or fear.    [Illustration: FIGURE 1.--Section of the head and throat locating the  organs of speech and song, including the upper resonators. The  important maxillary sinus cannot well be shown. It is found within the  maxillary bone (cheek bone). The inner end of the line marked _Nasal  cavity_ locates it.]      TIMBRE    The minute differences in these physical conditions, coupled with the  subtler differences in the psychical elements of the personality,  account for that distinctive physiognomy of the voice called =timbre=,  which is only another name for individuality as exhibited in each  person. The same general elements enter into the composition of all  voices, from the basso profundo to the high soprano.    That the reader may better understand the proportion and relations of  the different parts of the vocal apparatus, a sectional drawing of the  head is here produced, showing the natural position of the vocal  organs at rest. As the drawing represents but a vertical section of  the head the reader should note that the sinuses, like the eyes and  nostrils, lie in pairs to the right and left of the centre of the  face. The location of the maxillary sinuses within the maxillary or  cheek bones cannot be shown in this drawing.    The dark shading represents the cavities of the throat, nose, and  head. The relations of the parts are shown more accurately than is  possible in any diagram. It will be noticed that the vibrations from  the larynx would pass directly behind the soft palate into the nasal  chamber, and very directly into the mouth. The nasal roof is formed by  two bones situated between the eyes; the sphenoid or wedge-bone, which  is connected with all other bones of the head, and the ethmoid or  sieve-like bone. The structure of these two bones, especially of the  ethmoid, consists of very thin plates or laminae, forming a mass of air  cavities which communicate by small openings with the nasal cavity  below. Thus, the vibrations in the nose are transmitted to the air  spaces above, and the effective qualities of the head vibrations are  added to the tone.      THE LARYNX    The larynx or voice-box contains the vocal cords. Just above the vocal  cords on each side is a large, deep cavity, called the ventricle.  These cavities reinforce the primary vibrations set up by the cords  and serve to increase their intensity as they are projected from the  larynx. The larynx is the vibrating organ of the voice. It is situated  at the base of the tongue and is so closely connected with it by  attachment to the hyoid bone, to which the tongue is also attached,  that it is capable of only slight movement independent of that organ;  consequently it must move with the tongue in articulation. The  interior muscles of the larynx vary the position of its walls, thus  regulating the proximity and tension of the vocal cords. The male  larynx is the larger and shows the Adam's apple. In both sexes the  larynx of the low voice, alto or bass, is larger than that of the high  voice, soprano or tenor. The larynx and tongue should not rise with  the pitch of the voice, but drop naturally with the lower jaw as the  mouth opens in ascending the scale. The proper position of the tongue  will insure a proper position for the larynx. The less attention the  larynx receives the better.      THE VOCAL CORDS    The vocal cords are neither cords nor bands, but instead are thick  portions of membrane extending across the inner surface of the larynx.  On account of familiarity the name _vocal cords_ will still be used.  They are fairly well represented by the lips of the cornet player when  placed on the mouthpiece of the instrument. The pitch of the tone is  fixed by the tension of the vocal cords and the width and length of  the opening between them. Their tension and proximity are  self-adjusted to produce the proper pitch without any conscious  volition of the singer. They can have no special training, needing  only to be left alone. The work of the vocal cords, though essentially  important, is, when naturally performed, light and consequently not  exhausting. If the larynx and all of its supporting muscles are  relaxed as they are in free and easy breathing, then when the air  passes out through the larynx, the vocal cords will automatically  assume a tension sufficient to vocalize the breath and give the note  the proper pitch. The normal action of the cords will never cause  hoarseness or discomfort. The sound should seem to be formed, not in  the throat,--thus involving the vocal cords,--but in the resonance  chambers.      THE EPIGLOTTIS    The epiglottis is the valve which closes over the upper opening of the  larynx. It not only closes the mouth of the larynx when food is  swallowed, but aids materially in converting into tone the vibrations  set up by the vocal cords.      THE PHARYNX    The pharynx extends from the larynx to the nasal cavity. The size of  the opening into the nasal chamber is controlled by the soft palate  and is frequently entirely closed. The size of the pharynx is varied  by the contraction and relaxation of the circular muscles in its  tissue; when swallowing its walls are in contact. The pharynx acts as  does the expanding tube of brass instruments. It increases the force  and depth of the tone waves. The wider the pharynx is opened, without  constraint, the fuller the resonance and the better the tone.      THE UNDER JAW    The under jaw furnishes attachment for the muscles of the tongue and  hyoid or tongue bone. It also controls, owing to the connections of  the larynx with the hyoid bone, the muscles that fix the position of "]]]
