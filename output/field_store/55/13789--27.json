THE LITTLE RED HOUSE    Very few grown-up people understand houses. Only children understand  them properly, and, if I understand them just a little, it is because  I knew Sym. Sym and his wife, Emily Ann, lived in the Little Red  House. It was built on a rather big mountain, and there were no other  houses near it. At one time, long ago, the mountain had been covered  all over with a great forest; but men had cut the trees down, all but  one big Blue-gum, which grew near the Little Red House. The Blue-gum  and the Little Red House were great friends, and often had long talks  together. The Blue-gum was a very old tree--over a hundred years  old--and he was proud of it, and often used to tell of the time, long  ago, when blackfellows hunted 'possums in his branches. That was  before the white men came to the mountain, and before there were any  houses near it.    Once upon a time I put a verse about the mountain and the Little Red  House into a book of rhymes which I wrote for grown ups. I don't  think they thought much about it. Very likely they said, \"0h, it's  just a house on a hill,\" and then forgot it, because they were too  busy about other things.    This is the rhyme:    A great mother mountain, and kindly is she,  Who nurses young rivers and sends them to sea.  And, nestled high up on her sheltering lap,  Is a little red house, with a little straw cap  That bears a blue feather of smoke, curling high,  And a bunch of red roses cocked over one eye.    I have tried here to draw the Little Red House for you as well as I  can; and it isn't my fault if it happens to look just a little like  somebody's face. I can't help it, can I? if the stones of the door-step  look something like teeth, or if the climbing roses make the windows  look like a funny pair of spectacles. And if Emily Ann will hang bib  fluffy bobs on the window blinds for tassels, and if they swing about  in the breeze like moving eyes, well, I am not to blame, am I? It  just happens. The only thing I am sorry for is that I couldn't get  the big Blue-gum into the picture. Of course, I could have drawn it  quite easily, but it was too big.    Sym and Emily Ann were fond of the Little Red House, and you may be  sure the Little Red House was fond of them--he was their home. The  only thing that bothered him was that they were sometimes away from  home, and then he was miserable, like all empty houses.    Now, Sym was a tinker--a travelling tinker. He would do a little  gardening and farming at home for a while, and then go off about the  country for a few days, mending people's pots and pans and kettles.  Usually Sym left Emily Ann at home to keep the Little Red House  company, but now and then Emily Ann went with Sym for a trip, and  then the Little Red House was very sad indeed.    One morning, just as the sun was peeping over the edge of the world,  the big Blue-gum woke up and stretched his limbs and waited for the  Little Red House to say \"Good morning.\" The Blue-gum always waited  for the greeting because he was the older, and he liked to have  proper respect shown to him by young folk, but the Little Red House  didn't say a word.    The big Blue-gum waited and waited; but the Little Red House wouldn't  speak.    After a while the Blue-gum said rather crossly, \"You seem to be out  of sorts this morning.\"    But the Little Red House wouldn't say a word.    \"You certainly do seem as if you had a pain somewhere,\" said the  Blue-gum. \"And you look funny. You ought to see yourself!\"    \"Indeed?\" snapped the Little Red House, raising his eyebrows just as  a puff of wind went by. \"I can't always be playing the fool, like  some people.\"    \"I've lived on this mountain, tree and sapling, for over a hundred  years,\" replied the big Blue-gum very severely, \"and never before  have I been treated with such disrespect. When trees become houses  they seem to lose their manners.\"    \"Forgive me,\" cried the Little Red House. \"I didn't mean to be rude.  I was just listening. There are things going on inside me that I  don't like.\"    \"I hope they aren't ill-treating you,\" said the Blue-gum.    \"They are going to leave me!\" sighed the Little Red House.    \"And they are laughing quite happily, as if they were glad about it.  There's a nice thing for you!--Going to leave me, and laughing about it!\"    \"But perhaps you are wrong,\" said the big Blue-gum, who was not so  hard-hearted as he seemed.    \"I always know,\" moaned the Little Red House. \"I can't be mistaken.  Sym was singing his Tinker's song this morning long before the sun  was up. And then I heard him tell Emily Ann not to forget her umbrella.  That means that she is going; and the little dog is going, and I shall  be all alone.\"    \"Well,\" answered the Blue-gum rather stiffly, \"you still have ME for  company.\"    \"I know,\" sighed the Little Red House. \"Don't think I'm ungrateful.  But, when they both go away, I shan't be really and truly a home again  until they come back--just an empty house; and it makes me miserable.  How would YOU like to be an empty house?\"    \"Some day I might be,\" replied the Blue-gum, \"if I don't grow too old.  There is some fine timber in me yet.\"    Suddenly there was a great clattering and stamping inside the Little  House, and Sym began to sing his Tinker's song.    \"Kettles and pans! Kettles and pans!  All the broad earth is the tinkering man's--  The green leafy lane or the fields are his home,  The road or the river, where'er he way roam.  He roves for a living and rests where he can.  Then bring out your kettle! ho! kettle or pan!\"    There's a nice thing for you!\" said the Little Red House bitterly.  \"What kind of a song do you call that? Any old place is good enough  for his home, and I am just nothing!\"    \"Oh, that's only his way of putting it,\" answered the Blue-gum kindly.  \"He doesn't really mean it, you know; he wants a change, that's all.\"    But the Little Red House wouldn't say a word.    \"It looks a good deal like rain this morning, doesn't it?\" said the  Blue-gum cheerfully, trying to change the subject.    But the Little Red House wouldn't say a word.    Very soon Sym and Emily Ann, carrying bundles, came out of the Little  Red House, laughing and talking; and Sym locked the door.    \"Now for a jolly trip!\" shouted Sym, as he picked up his firepot and  soldering-irons.    But all at once Emily Ann ceased laughing and looked back wistfully  at the Little Red House.    \"After all I'm sorry to leave our little home,\" she said. \"See how  sad it looks!\"    \"Hurry on!\" cried Sym, who was all eagerness for the trip. Then he,  too, looked back. \"Why, you forgot to draw down the blinds,\" he said.    \"No, I didn't forget,\" answered Emily Ann, \"but I think it a shame to  blindfold the Little Red House while we are away. I just left the  blinds up so that he could see things. Good-bye, little home,\" she  called. And the Little Red House felt just the least bit comforted to  think that Emily Ann was sorry to leave him. Then she went off down  the winding path with Sym; and Sym began to shout his Tinker's Song  again.    The Little Red House watched them go down the mountain.    Away they went: through the gate, past the black stump, round by the  bracken patch and over the bridge, across the potato paddock, through  the sliprails--getting smaller and smaller--past the sign-post, down  by the big rocks--getting smaller and smaller--under the tree-ferns,  out on to the stony flat, across the red road, until they were just  two tiny specks away down in the valley. Then they went through a  white gate, round a turn, and the high scrub hid them.    Had you been able to see the Little Red House just at that moment, you  would have been sure he was going to cry--he looked so miserable and  so lonely.    \"Cheer up!\" said the big Blue-gum.    But the Little Red House couldn't say a word.    Presently the big Blue-gum groaned loudly.    \"Oo! Ah! Ah! Golly!\" groaned the Blue-gum in a strange voice.    \"I beg your pardon? said the Little Red House.    \"Oh, I have a nasty sharp pain in my side,\" said the Blue-gum. \"I do  hope and trust it isn't white-ants. It would be simply horrible, if  it were. Fancy getting white-ants at my time of life! Here I have  lived on this mountain, tree and sapling, for over a hundred years;  and to think those nasty, white, flabby little things should get me  at last is horrible--horrible!\"    \"I am sorry,\" said the Little Red House. \"I'm afraid I've been very  selfish, too. I was forgetting that everyone has troubles of his own;  but I hope it isn't so bad as you fear.\"    \"It is bad enough,\" groaned the Blue-gum. \"Ow! There it is again. I'm  afraid it IS white-ants. I can feel the wretched little things nipping.\"    But the Little Red House hardly heard him. He was thinking again of  his own troubles.    So they stood all through that day, saying very little to each other.  Rabbits came and played about the Little Red House, and lizards ran  over his door-step, and once a big wallaby went flopping right past  the front gate. But the Little Red House paid no attention. He was  too busy thinking of his loneliness.    Birds came and perched in the branches of the big Blue-gum, and  chattered and sang to him, trying to tell him the news of other trees  on distant mountains. But the big Blue-gum took no notice.

So affectionate toward each  other, so gentle and withal so bright and lively, they seemed to bring  a streak of sunshine with them whenever they came.  Miss Dorothy, who  was tall and stately, seldom sat on the grassy tufts which rose like  little footstools at the base of each tree, but rambled about while  talking.  This was perhaps because she disliked to rumple her  beautifully starched skirts.  But Miss Katie--impetuous, dimple-cheeked  Katie, would fling herself down anywhere regardless of edged ruffles or  floating sash ribbons.    \"For it is clean dirt,\" she laughingly said, when Miss Dorothy  playfully scolded her for it.  \"This kind of dirt is healthful, and it  isn't going to hurt me if a few dusty twigs or a bit of dried grass or  weeds should cling to my gown.  You must remember, Sister Dorothy,  there are different kinds of dirt.  I haven't any respect for grease  spots or for clothes soiled from wearing them too long.  I don't like  that kind of dirt, but to get close to dear old mother earth, and have  a scent of her fresh soil once in a while is what I enjoy.  It is  delightful.  I like nature too well to stand on ceremony with her.\"    \"You like butterflies too, don't you, aunty?\" asked little Marian.    \"To be sure I do, dear.  I love all the pretty things that fly.\"    \"And the birdies too?\" asked the child.    \"Yes, indeed; I love the birds the best of all.\"    \"And the old cat was awful naughty when he caught the baby robin the  other day and ate it up.  Wasn't he, aunty?\"    \"Yes.  Tom is a cruel, bad, bad cat,\" responded Miss Katie, as she  squeezed Marian's little pink hand between her own palms.  \"That  naughty puss gets plenty to eat in the house and there are lots of nice  fat mice in the barn, and yet he slips slyly out to the orchard and  takes the life of a poor, innocent little bird.\"    \"And it made the mamma-bird cry because her little one was dead,\" added  Miss Dorothy, who had drawn near.    Little Marian heaved a deep sigh and her rosy lips trembled  suspiciously.  \"Poor mamma-bird!  It can never have its baby bird any  more,\" she said, with a sob of sympathy.  \"Don't you feel sorry for it,  Aunt Dorothy?\"    \"Yes, dear.  I feel very sorry for it.\"    \"And I expect the poor mamma-bird cries and cries and weeps and grieves  when she comes home to supper and finds out her little children are  gone forever and ever.\"  And with her bright eyes dimmed with tears of  pity, Marian, clasping a hand of each of the young ladies, walked  slowly to the house still bewailing the fate of the robin.    My heart warmed toward these sweet young girls for their tender  sympathy.  I almost wished I were a carrier pigeon, that I might devote  myself hereafter to their service by bearing loving messages from them  to their friends.    But, alas!  I was to have a rude awakening from this pleasant thought.  As we flew that evening to our roosting-place, I observed to my mother  that if there were no cats in the world what a delightful time we birds  might have.    \"You have a greater enemy than the cat,\" she responded sadly.  \"It is  true the cat is cruel and tries to kill us, but it knows no better.\"    \"If not the cat, what enemy is it?\" I asked in surprise.  \"I thought  the cat was the most bloodthirsty foe the birds had.\"    My mother dipped her wings more slowly and poised her body gracefully a  moment.  Then she said impressively, \"Our greatest enemy is man.  No,\"  suddenly correcting herself, \"not man, but women, women and children.\"    \"Women and dear little children our enemies?\" said I, in astonishment.  \"The pretty ladies who speak so sweet and kind!  The pretty ladies who  gather roses in the garden!  Would they deprive us of life?\"    My mother nodded.    \"Yes,\" she answered, \"the pretty ladies, the wicked ladies.\"          CHAPTER II    DICKEY DOWNY'S MEDITATION      It hath the excuse of youth.            --_Shakespeare._      That night I pondered long upon what my mother had told me.  Ever since  I left my shell I had been taught to respect my elders, and that it was  a mark of ill manners and bad breeding for children to question the  superior knowledge of those much older than themselves.  Notwithstanding this, in my secret heart I could not help thinking that  my mother was mistaken in her estimate of women when she called them  wicked.  She had surely misjudged them.  However, I took good care not  to mention these doubts to her.    I had heard from my grandmother, who had traveled a great deal from the  tropics to the North and back again, that women were the leaders in the  churches and were foremost in all Christian and philanthropic work;  that they provided beautiful homes for orphan children, where they took  care of them and nursed them when they were sick.  She told me about  the hospitals where diseased and aged people were kindly cared for by  them.  She said they were active in the societies for the prevention of  cruelty to children and to animals.  They fed armies of tramps out of  sheer pity; even the debauched drunkard was the object of their  tenderest care and their earnest prayers.  They held out a friendly  hand to the prisoners in the jails and sent them flowers and Bibles;  they pitied and cheered the outcast with kind words.  They offered  themselves as missionaries for foreign lands to convert the heathen and  bring them to Christ.  They soothed the sick and made easy the last  days of the dying.    On the battlefield, when blood was flowing and cannon smoking, my  grandmother had seen the Red Cross women like angels of mercy binding  up the gaping wounds and gently closing the glazed eyes of the expiring  soldier.  In woman's ear was poured his last message to his loved ones  far away, and when death was near it was woman who spoke the words of  consolation and her finger that pointed hopefully to the stars.    Did not all this prove her to be sweet and tender and loving and gentle  and kind?  Yes--a thousand times yes.    My grandmother once had her nest near a cemetery, and often related  pathetic incidents which had come under her observation at that time.  One in particular I now recalled.  It was of a woman who came every day  to weep over the mound where her babe was buried.  She was worn to a  shadow from her long watching through its illness, and when it was  taken from her, her grief was deep.  The bright world was no longer  bright since she was bereft of her darling, and her moans for the lost  loved one were heartrending.    This incident was only yet another instance of the tenderness of  woman's nature, and I could not reconcile it with what my mother had  told me.    \"No, no,\" I repeated as I cuddled my head under my wing, \"never can I  believe that woman, tender-hearted woman, who is all love and mercy,  all gentleness and pity, never can I believe she is our enemy.\"  And  resolving to ask my mother to more fully explain her unjust assertion I  fell asleep.    But a source of fresh anxiety arose which for a time caused me to  forget the matter.    The lindens which fringed the wood were now in full leafage, adorned  with their delicate ball-like tassels, and hosts of birds flitted among  them daily.  Many of them were of the kind frequently known as indigo  birds, smaller than the ordinary bluebird.  In color they were of the  metallic cast of blue which has a sheen distinct from the rich shade  seen on the jay's wings or the brilliance of the bluebird.  Flashing in  and out among the hanging blossoms their beautiful blue coats made them  an easy target for the boys who attended the neighborhood country  school.    [Illustration: The Indigo Bird.]    To bring down a sweet songster with a shower of stones, panting and  bleeding to the ground, they thought was the best sport in the world,  and the woods rang and echoed with their whoops and cheers as each poor  bird fell to the earth.  A mere glimpse of one of the blue beauties as  he hid among the leaves seemed to fire these cruel children with a wish  to kill it.    One half-grown boy, who went by the name of Big Bill, was noticeable  for his brutality.  He encouraged the others in cruelties which they  might not have thought of, for such is the force of evil example and  companionship.  A distinguishing mark was a large scar on his cheek,  probably inflicted by some enraged animal while being tortured by him.  I always felt sure Big Bill would come to some bad end.  My mother said  that a cruel childhood was often a training school for the gallows, and  the boy who killed defenseless birds and bugs deadened his  sensibilities and destroyed his moral nature so that it was easy to  commit greater crimes.    So dreadful became the persecutions of the schoolboys that the indigo  birds finally held a council and determined to leave that part of the  country and settle far from the habitations of men, where they might  live unmolested and free from persecutions.          CHAPTER III    THE RULER WITH THE IRON HAND      But evil is wrought by want of thought    As well as want of heart.            --_Hood._      One morning as we flew across the open space which lay between the wood  and the wheat fields, we noticed two gentlemen in the orchard who were  carefully examining the trees, peering curiously into the cracks of the  rough bark or unfolding the curled leaves.    As we came nearer we discovered that one of them was the owner of the  place, the father of Miss Dorothy and Miss Katie.  The other was a thin  gentleman in spectacles, who held a magnifying glass through which he  intently looked at a twig which he had broken off.    After a few minutes' inspection he said: \"Colonel, your orchard is  somewhat affected.  This is a specimen of the _chionaspis furfuris_.\"    \"Is it anything like the scurfy-bark louse?\" inquired the colonel.    \"The same thing exactly.  It occurs more commonly in the apple, but it  infects the pear and "]]]
