She remembered their coming back in the darkness; numbers  of strange men she had never seen before. Old men, young men, and boys,  all on their rough-coated horses, and how they came indoors, and what a  noise they made all talking together in their big deep voices. They  looked terrible men, so tall and brown and fierce, with their rough  bristly beards; and they all spoke in such funny tones to her, as if  they were trying to make their voices small.    During many days these men came and went, and every time they were more  sad, and less noisy. The little boy's mother used to come and stay,  crying, whilst the men were searching the bush for her little son. Then,  one evening, Dot's father came home alone, and both her mother and the  little boy's mother went away in a great hurry. Then, very late, her  mother came back crying, and her father sat smoking by the fire looking  very sad, and she never saw that little boy again, although he had been  found.    She wondered now if all these rough, big men were riding into the bush  to find her, and if, after many days, they would find her, and no one  ever see her again. She seemed to see her mother crying, and her father  very sad, and all the men very solemn. These thoughts made her so  miserable that she began to cry herself.    Dot does not know how long she was sobbing in loneliness and fear, with  her head on her knees, and with her little hands covering her eyes so as  not to see the cruel wild bush in which she was lost. It seemed a long  time before she summoned up courage to uncover her weeping eyes, and  look once more at the bare, dry earth, and the wilderness of scrub and  trees that seemed to close her in as if she were in a prison. When she  did look up, she was surprised to see that she was no longer alone. She  forgot all her trouble and fear in her astonishment at seeing a big grey  Kangaroo squatting quite close to her, in front of her.    [Illustration: THE KANGAROO FINDS DOT]    What was most surprising was that the Kangaroo evidently understood that  Dot was in trouble, and was sorry for her; for down the animal's nice  soft grey muzzle two tiny little tears were slowly trickling. When Dot  looked up at it with wonder in her round blue eyes, the Kangaroo did not  jump away, but remained gazing sympathetically at Dot with a slightly  puzzled air. Suddenly the big animal seemed to have an idea, and it  lightly hopped off into the scrub, where Dot could just see it bobbing  up and down as if it were hunting for something. Presently back came the  strange Kangaroo with a spray of berries in her funny black hands. They  were pretty berries. Some were green, some were red, some blue, and  others white. Dot was quite glad to take them when the Kangaroo offered  them to her; and as this friendly animal seemed to wish her to eat them,  she did so gladly, because she was beginning to feel hungry.    After she had eaten a few berries a very strange thing happened. While  Dot had been alone in the bush it had all seemed so dreadfully still.  There had been no sound but the gentle stir of a light, fitful breeze  in the far-away tree-tops. All around had been so quiet, that her  loneliness had seemed twenty times more lonely. Now, however, under the  influence of these small, sweet berries, Dot was surprised to hear  voices everywhere. At first it seemed like hearing sounds in a dream,  they were so faint and distant, but soon the talking grew nearer and  nearer, louder and clearer, until the whole bush seemed filled with  talking.    They were all little voices, some indeed quite tiny whispers and  squeaks, but they were very numerous, and seemed to be everywhere. They  came from the earth, from the bushes, from the trees, and from the very  air. The little girl looked round to see where they came from, but  everything looked just the same. Hundreds of ants, of all kinds and  sizes, were hurrying to their nests; a few lizards were scuttling about  amongst the dry twigs and sparse grasses; there were some grasshoppers,  and in the trees birds fluttered to and fro. Then Dot knew that she was  hearing, and understanding, everything that was being said by all the  insects and creatures in the bush.    All this time the Kangaroo had been speaking, only Dot had been too  surprised to listen. But now the gentle, soft voice of the kind animal  caught her attention, and she found that the Kangaroo was in the middle  of a speech.    \"I understood what was the matter with you at once,\" she was saying,  \"for I feel just the same myself. I have been miserable, like you, ever  since I lost my baby kangaroo. You also must have lost something. Tell  me what it is?\"    \"I've lost my way,\" said Dot; rather wondering if the Kangaroo would  understand her.    \"Ah!\" said the Kangaroo, quite delighted at her own cleverness, \"I knew  you had lost something! Isn't it a dreadful feeling? You feel as if you  had no inside, don't you? And you're not inclined to eat anything--not  even the youngest grass. I have been like that ever since I lost my baby  kangaroo. Now tell me,\" said the creature confidentially, \"what your way  is like, I may be able to find it for you.\"    Dot found that she must explain what she meant by saying she had \"lost  her way,\" and the Kangaroo was much interested.    \"Well,\" said she, after listening to the little girl, \"that is just like  you Humans; you are not fit for this country at all! Of course, if you  have only one home in one place, you _must_ lose it! If you made your  home everywhere and anywhere, it would never be lost. Humans are no good  in our bush,\" she continued. \"Just look at yourself now. How do you  compare with a kangaroo? There is your ridiculous sham coat. Well, you  have lost bits of it all the way you have come to-day, and you're nearly  left in your bare skin. Now look at _my_ coat. I've done ever so much  more hopping than you to-day, and you see I'm none the worse. I wonder  why all your fur grows upon the top of your head,\" she said  reflectively, as she looked curiously at Dot's long flaxen curls. \"It's  such a silly place to have one's fur the thickest! You see, we have very  little there; for we don't want our heads made any hotter under the  Australian sun. See how much better off you would be, now that nearly  all your sham coat is gone, if that useless fur had been chopped into  little, short lengths, and spread all over your poor bare body. I wonder  why you Humans are made so badly,\" she ended, with a puzzled air.    Dot felt for a moment as if she ought to apologise for being so unfit  for the bush, and for having all the fur on the top of her head. But,  somehow, she had an idea that a little girl must be something better  than a kangaroo, although the Kangaroo certainly seemed a very superior  person; so she said nothing, but again began to eat the berries.    \"You must not eat any more of these berries,\" said the Kangaroo,  anxiously.    \"Why?\" asked Dot, \"they are very nice, and I'm very hungry.\"    The Kangaroo gently took the spray out of Dot's hand, and threw it away.  \"You see,\" she said, \"if you eat too many of them, you'll know too  much.\"    \"One can't know too much,\" argued the little girl.    \"Yes you can, though,\" said the Kangaroo, quickly. \"If you eat too many  of those berries, you'll learn too much, and that gives you indigestion,  and then you become miserable. I don't want you to be miserable any  more, for I'm going to find your 'lost way.'\"    The mention of finding her way reminded the little girl of her sad  position, which, in her wonder at talking with the Kangaroo, had been  quite forgotten for a little while. She became sad again; and seeing how  dim the light was getting, her thoughts went back to her parents. She  longed to be with them to be kissed and cuddled, and her blue eyes  filled with tears.    \"Your eyes just now remind me of two fringed violets, with the morning  dew on them, or after a shower,\" said the Kangaroo. \"Why are you  crying?\"    \"I was thinking,\" said Dot.    \"Oh! don't think!\" pleaded the Kangaroo; \"I never do myself.\"    \"I can't help it!\" explained the little girl. \"What do you do instead?\"  she asked.    \"I always jump to conclusions,\" said the Kangaroo, and she promptly  bounded ten feet at one hop. Lightly springing back again to her  position in front of the child, she added, \"and that's why I never have  a headache.\"    \"Dear Kangaroo,\" said Dot, \"do you know where I can get some water? I'm  very thirsty!\"    \"Of course you are,\" said her friend; \"everyone is at sundown. I'm  thirsty myself. But the nearest water-hole is a longish way off, so we  had better start at once.\"    Little Dot got up with an effort. After her long run and fatigue, she  was very stiff, and her little legs were so tired and weak, that after a  few steps she staggered and fell.    The Kangaroo looked at the child compassionately. \"Poor little Human,\"  she said, \"your legs aren't much good, and, for the life of me, I don't  understand how you can expect to get along without a tail. The  water-hole is a good way off,\" she added, with a sigh, as she looked  down at Dot, lying on the ground, and she was very puzzled what to do.  But suddenly she brightened up. \"I have an idea,\" she said joyfully.  \"Just step into my pouch, and I'll hop you down to the water-hole in  less time than it takes a locust to shrill.\"    Timidly and carefully, Dot did the Kangaroo's bidding, and found herself  in the cosiest, softest little bag imaginable. The Kangaroo seemed  overjoyed, when Dot was comfortably settled in her pouch. \"I feel as if  I had my dear baby kangaroo again!\" she exclaimed; and immediately she  bounded away through the tangled scrub, over stones and bushes, over dry  water-courses and great fallen trees. And all Dot felt was a gentle  rocking motion, and a fresh breeze in her face, which made her so"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18900"],[0,"A Text-Book of the History of Painting (#2)"],[1,"Kuenste_.

The first important records of this  art are met with in Egypt; but before the Egyptian civilization the  men of the early ages probably used color in ornamentation and  decoration, and they certainly scratched the outlines of men and  animals upon bone and slate. Traces of this rude primitive work still  remain to us on the pottery, weapons, and stone implements of the  cave-dwellers. But while indicating the awakening of intelligence in  early man, they can be reckoned with as art only in a slight  archaeological way. They show inclination rather than accomplishment--a  wish to ornament or to represent, with only a crude knowledge of how  to go about it.    The first aim of this primitive painting was undoubtedly  decoration--the using of colored forms for color and form only, as  shown in the pottery designs or cross-hatchings on stone knives or  spear-heads. The second, and perhaps later aim, was by imitating the  shapes and colors of men, animals, and the like, to convey an idea of  the proportions and characters of such things. An outline of a  cave-bear or a mammoth was perhaps the cave-dweller's way of telling  his fellows what monsters he had slain. We may assume that it was  pictorial record, primitive picture-written history. This early method  of conveying an idea is, in intent, substantially the same as the  later hieroglyphic writing and historical painting of the Egyptians.  The difference between them is merely one of development. Thus there  is an indication in the art of Primitive Man of the two great  departments of painting existent to-day.    1. DECORATIVE PAINTING.    2. EXPRESSIVE PAINTING.    Pure Decorative Painting is not usually expressive of ideas other than  those of rhythmical line and harmonious color. It is not our subject.  This volume treats of Expressive Painting; but in dealing with that it  should be borne in mind that Expressive Painting has always a more or  less decorative effect accompanying it, and that must be spoken of  incidentally. We shall presently see the intermingling of both kinds  of painting in the art of ancient Egypt--our first inquiry.          CHAPTER I.    EGYPTIAN PAINTING.

LAND AND PEOPLE: Egypt, as Herodotus has said, is \"the gift of the  Nile,\" one of the latest of the earth's geological formations, and yet  one of the earliest countries to be settled and dominated by man. It  consists now, as in the ancient days, of the valley of the Nile,  bounded on the east by the Arabian mountains and on the west by the  Libyan desert. Well-watered and fertile, it was doubtless at first a  pastoral and agricultural country; then, by its riverine traffic, a  commercial country, and finally, by conquest, a land enriched with the  spoils of warfare.    Its earliest records show a strongly established monarchy. Dynasties  of kings called Pharaohs succeeded one another by birth or conquest.  The king made the laws, judged the people, declared war, and was  monarch supreme. Next to him in rank came the priests, who were not  only in the service of religion but in that of the state, as  counsellors, secretaries, and the like. The common people, with true  Oriental lack of individuality, depending blindly on leaders, were  little more than the servants of the upper classes.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--HUNTING IN THE MARSHES. TOMB OF TI, SACCARAH.  (FROM PERROT AND CHIPIEZ.)]    The Egyptian religion existing in the earliest days was a worship of  the personified elements of nature. Each element had its particular  controlling god, worshipped as such. Later on in Egyptian history the  number of gods was increased, and each city had its trinity of godlike  protectors symbolized by the propylaea of the temples. Future life was  a certainty, provided that the Ka, or spirit, did not fall a prey to  Typhon, the God of Evil, during the long wait in the tomb for the  judgment-day. The belief that the spirit rested in the body until  finally transported to the aaln fields (the Islands of the Blest,  afterward adopted by the Greeks) was one reason for the careful  preservation of the body by mummifying processes. Life itself was not  more important than death. Hence the imposing ceremonies of the  funeral and burial, the elaborate richness of the tomb and its wall  paintings. Perhaps the first Egyptian art arose through religious  observance, and certainly the first known to us was sepulchral.    ART MOTIVES: The centre of the Egyptian system was the monarch and his  supposed relatives, the gods. They arrogated to themselves the chief  thought of life, and the aim of the great bulk of the art was to  glorify monarchy or deity. The massive buildings, still standing  to-day in ruins, were built as the dwelling-places of kings or the  sanctuaries of gods. The towers symbolized deity, the sculptures and  paintings recited the functional duties of presiding spirits, or the  Pharaoh's looks and acts. Almost everything about the public buildings  in painting and sculpture was symbolic illustration, picture-written  history--written with a chisel and brush, written large that all might  read. There was no other safe way of preserving record. There were no  books; the papyrus sheet, used extensively, was frail, and the  Egyptians evidently wished their buildings, carvings, and paintings to  last into eternity. So they wrought in and upon stone. The same  hieroglyphic character of their papyrus writings appeared cut and  colored on the palace walls, and above them and beside them the  pictures ran as vignettes explanatory of the text. In a less  ostentatious way the tombs perpetuated history in a similar manner,  reciting the domestic scenes from the life of the individual, as the  temples and palaces the religious and monarchical scenes.    In one form or another it was all record of Egyptian life, but this  was not the only motive of their painting. The temples and palaces,  designed to shut out light and heat, were long squares of heavy stone,  gloomy as the cave from which their plan may have originated. Carving  and color were used to brighten and enliven the interior. The battles,  the judgment scenes, the Pharaoh playing at draughts with his wives,  the religious rites and ceremonies, were all given with brilliant  arbitrary color, surrounded oftentimes by bordering bands of green,  yellow, and blue. Color showed everywhere from floor to ceiling. Even  the explanatory hieroglyphic texts ran in colors, lining the walls and  winding around the cylinders of stone. The lotus capitals, the frieze  and architrave, all glowed with bright hues, and often the roof  ceiling was painted in blue and studded with golden stars.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--PORTRAIT OF QUEEN TAIA. (FROM PERROT AND  CHIPIEZ.)]    All this shows a decorative motive in Egyptian painting, and how  constantly this was kept in view may be seen at times in the  arrangement of the different scenes, the large ones being placed in  the middle of the wall and the smaller ones going at the top and  bottom, to act as a frieze and dado. There were, then, two leading  motives for Egyptian painting; (1) History, monarchical, religious, or  domestic; and (2) Decoration.    TECHNICAL METHODS: Man in the early stages of civilization comprehends  objects more by line than by color or light. The figure is not  studied in itself, but in its sun-shadow or silhouette. The Egyptian  hieroglyph represented objects by outlines or arbitrary marks and  conveyed a simple meaning without circumlocution. The Egyptian  painting was substantially an enlargement of the hieroglyph. There was  no attempt to place objects in the setting which they hold in nature.  Perspective and light-and-shade were disregarded. Objects, of whatever  nature, were shown in flat profile. In the human figure the shoulders  were square, the hips slight, the legs and arms long, the feet and  hands flat. The head, legs, and arms were shown in profile, while the  chest and eye were twisted to show the flat front view. There are only  one or two full-faced figures among the remains of Egyptian painting.  After the outline was drawn the enclosed space was filled in with  plain color. In the absence of high light, or composed groups,  prominence was given to an important figure, like that of the king, by  making it much larger than the other figures. This may be seen in any  of the battle-pieces of Rameses II., in which the monarch in his  chariot is a giant where his followers are mere pygmies. In the  absence of perspective, receding figures of men or of horses were  given by multiplied outlines of legs, or heads, placed before, or  after, or raised above one another. Flat water was represented by  zigzag lines, placed as it were upon a map, one tree symbolized a  forest, and one fortification a town.    These outline drawings were not realistic in any exact sense. The face  was generally expressionless, the figure, evidently done from memory  or pattern, did not reveal anatomical structure, but was nevertheless  graceful, and in the representation of animals the sense of motion was  often given with"]]]
