[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19354"],[0,"Lessons in Music Form (#2)"],[1,"    *      *      *    Still another, and possibly the strongest argument of all for the  necessity of form in music, is derived from reflection upon the  peculiarly vague and intangible nature of its art-material--tone,  sound.  The words of a language (also sounds, it is true) have  established meanings, so familiar and definite that they recall and  re-awaken impressions of thought and action with a vividness but little  short of the actual experience.  Tones, on the contrary, are not and  cannot be associated with any _definite_ ideas or impressions; they are  as impalpable as they are transient, and, taken separately, leave no  lasting trace.    Therefore, whatever stability and palpability a musical composition is  to acquire, _must be derived from its form, or design_, and not from  its totally unsubstantial material.  It must fall back upon the network  traced by the disposition of its points and lines upon the musical  canvas; for this it is that constitutes its real and palpable contents.      THE EVIDENCES OF FORM IN MUSIC.--The presence of form in music is  manifested, first of all, by the disposition of tones and chords in  symmetrical measures, and by the numerous methods of tone arrangement  which create and define the element of Rhythm,--the distinction of  short and long time-values, and of accented and unaccented (that is,  heavy and light) pulses.    This is not what is commonly supposed to constitute form in music, but  it is the fundamental condition out of which an orderly system of form  may be developed.  As well might the carpenter or architect venture to  dispense with scale, compass and square in their constructive labors,  as that the composer should neglect beat, measure and rhythm, in his  effort to realize a well-developed and intelligible design in the  whole, or any part, of his composition.  The beats and measures and  phrases are the barley-corn, inch and ell of the musical draughtsman,  and without these units of measurement and proportion, neither the  vital condition of Symmetry nor the equally important condition of  well-regulated Contrast could be clearly established.    The _beat_ is the unit of measurement in music.  The _measure_ is a  group of beats,--two, three, four, or more, at the option of the  composer.  The bounds of the measures are visibly represented (on the  written or printed page) by vertical lines, called bars; and are  rendered orally recognizable (to the hearer who does not see the page)  by a more or less delicate emphasis, imparted--by some means or  other--to the _first_ pulse or beat of each measure, as accent, simply  to mark where each new group begins.  Those who play or sing can  imagine how vague, and even chaotic, a page of music would look if  these vertical bars were omitted; and how much more difficult it would  be to read than when these (not only accustomed, but truly necessary)  landmarks are present.  Precisely the same unintelligible impression  must be, and is, conveyed to the hearer when _his_ landmarks, the  accents, are not indicated with sufficient emphasis or clearness to  render him sensible of the beginning of each new measure.          *      *      *      *      *      *    The same primary system of measurement and association which is  employed in enlarging the beats to measures, is then applied to the  association of the measures themselves in the next larger units of  musical structure, the Motive, Phrase, Period, and so forth.  Unlike  the measures, which are defined by the accents at their _beginning_,  these larger factors of form are defined chiefly at their _end_, by the  impression of occasional periodic interruption, exactly analogous to  the pauses at the end of poetic lines, or at the commas, semicolons and  the like, in a prose paragraph.  These interruptions of the musical  current, called Cadences, are generally so well defined that even the  more superficial listener is made aware of a division of the musical  pattern into its sections and parts, each one of which closes as  recognizably (though not as irrevocably) as the very last sentence of  the piece.    Cadences serve the same purpose in music, then, as do the punctuation  marks in rhetoric; and an idea of the senselessness and confusion of a  musical composition, if left devoid of cadences in sufficient number  and force, may be gleaned from an experimental test of the effect of a  page of prose, read with persistent disregard of its commas, colons,  and other marks of \"cadence.\"          *      *      *      *      *      *    Another evidence of Form in music, that is at once subtle and powerful,  rests upon what might be termed the _linear_ quality of melody.  The  famous old definition of a line as a \"succession of points,\" tallies so  accurately with that of melody (as a \"succession of single tones\"),  that it is not only proper, but peculiarly forceful, to speak of  melodies as _tone-lines_.  Our conception of a melody or tune, our  ability to recognize and reproduce it, depends far more upon its  undulations, its rising, falling, or resting level, than upon its  rhythmic features (the varying lengths of its tones).  These movements  trace a resonant line before our mind's eye as surely, though perhaps  not as distinctly, as the pencil of the artist traces the lines of an  image upon the paper; and this process is going on constantly, from  beginning to end, in every piece of music.  In a portrait it describes  the contours of face and figure,--in a word, the _Form_; in the musical  composition it fulfils, to a great extent, the self-same mission, that  of defining the Form.  One clear, predominating tone-line traces the  \"air\" or tune of the piece; and this is often the only line that  arrests the hearer's attention; but there are other tone-lines, less  prominent and less extended and coherent, gliding along harmoniously  beside the Melody proper, which (something like the shading in a  picture) contribute to the richness of the design, and perform their  share in proving and illuminating the Form of the whole.    This is most salient in music for orchestra, where each player  describes an individual tone-line, rendered all the more distinct and  recognizable by the specific \"color\" of his instrument; and that is the  chief, perhaps the sole, reason why the orchestra is esteemed the most  complete and perfect medium of musical expression.      UNITY AND VARIETY.--As much as opinions and beliefs may differ, among  music critics, as to the necessity of Form in music, and the conditions  of its existence, no reasonable objection can be taken to the  hypothesis that _Clearness and Attractiveness_ are the two vital  requisites upon which the enjoyment of any art depends.  The artist's  utterances or creations must be intelligible, and they must be  interesting.  The lack, partial or total, of either of these qualities  neutralizes the force of the intended impression, in precise proportion  to the default.    In musical composition these two requisites are embodied in the  principles of Unity and Variety.    _Unity_--in its various technical phases of Uniformity, Regularity,  Similarity, Equality, Agreement, or whatever other synonym we may find  it convenient to use--is the condition out of which the composer must  secure intelligibility, clearness, definiteness of expression.  Glance  at Ex. 2, and note the evidences of unity (similarity) in the rhythmic  and melodic formation of the first four measures.    _Variety_--in its most comprehensive application--is the medium he must  employ to arouse and sustain the hearer's interest.  Glance again at  Ex. 2, and note the contrast between the two halves of the first four  measures, and between these and the following two measures.    These conditions are, of course, squarely opposed to each other, though  their interaction is reciprocal rather than antagonistic; and, from  what has been said, it is obvious that they are of equal importance.  Hence, as was declared on the second page, the great problem of the  art-creator consists in so balancing their operations that neither may  encroach upon the domain of the other.  For too constant and palpable  Unity will inevitably paralyze interest; while too much Variety will as  surely tend to obscure the distinctness of the design.          *      *      *      *      *      *    The workings of the principle of Unity (to which attention must first  be given, because it appears to come first in the order of creation)  are shown in the following elementary details of composition:--    (1) Music is not an art that deals with space, but with Time; therefore  the units of its metrical structure are not inches and the like, but  divisions of time, the basis of which is the _beat_.  The principle of  Unity dictates that the beats which are associated in one and the same  musical sentence shall be of equal duration.  Every musician admits the  necessity of keeping \"strict time\"--that is, marking the beats in  regular, equal pulses.  The sub-divisions of the beats (for example,  the eighth or sixteenth notes within a beat) must also be symmetric.  So imperative is this law that it generally prevails through the entire  piece, with only such temporary elongations or contractions (marked  _ritardando_ or _accelerando_) as may be introduced for oratorical  effects.    (2) The beats are grouped in _measures_ of uniform duration; that is,  containing equal numbers of beats.    (3) The natural _accent_ falls upon the corresponding beat, namely, the  first, of each measure; therefore it recurs regularly, at uniform  intervals of time.    (4) The _melodic contents_ of the first measure, or measures, are  copied (more or less literally) in the next measure, or measures; and  are encountered again and again in the later course of the piece, thus  insuring a fairly uniform melodic impression from which the character  and identity of the composition are derived.

Two minutes later the machine deposited him all dressed at the threshold  of his office. The round of journalistic work was now begun. First he  enters the hall of the novel-writers, a vast apartment crowned with an  enormous transparent cupola. In one corner is a telephone, through which  a hundred Earth Chronicle _littérateurs_ in turn recount to the public  in daily installments a hundred novels. Addressing one of these authors  who was waiting his turn, \"Capital! Capital! my dear fellow,\" said he,  \"your last story. The scene where the village maid discusses interesting  philosophical problems with her lover shows your very acute power of  observation. Never have the ways of country folk been better portrayed.  Keep on, my dear Archibald, keep on! Since yesterday, thanks to you,  there is a gain of 5000 subscribers.\"    \"Mr. John Last,\" he began again, turning to a new arrival, \"I am not so  well pleased with your work. Your story is not a picture of life; it  lacks the elements of truth. And why? Simply because you run straight on  to the end; because you do not analyze. Your heroes do this thing or  that from this or that motive, which you assign without ever a thought  of dissecting their mental and moral natures. Our feelings, you must  remember, are far more complex than all that. In real life every act is  the resultant of a hundred thoughts that come and go, and these you must  study, each by itself, if you would create a living character. 'But,'  you will say, 'in order to note these fleeting thoughts one must know  them, must be able to follow them in their capricious meanderings.' Why,  any child can do that, as you know. You have simply to make use of  hypnotism, electrical or human, which gives one a two-fold being,  setting free the witness-personality so that it may see, understand, and  remember the reasons which determine the personality that acts. Just  study yourself as you live from day to day, my dear Last. Imitate your  associate whom I was complimenting a moment ago. Let yourself be  hypnotized. What's that? You have tried it already? Not sufficiently,  then, not sufficiently!\"    Mr. Smith continues his round and enters the reporters' hall. Here 1500  reporters, in their respective places, facing an equal number of  telephones, are communicating to the subscribers the news of the world  as gathered during the night. The organization of this matchless service  has often been described. Besides his telephone, each reporter, as the  reader is aware, has in front of him a set of commutators, which enable  him to communicate with any desired telephotic line. Thus the  subscribers not only hear the news but see the occurrences. When an  incident is described that is already past, photographs of its main  features are transmitted with the narrative. And there is no confusion  withal. The reporters' items, just like the different stories and all  the other component parts of the journal, are classified automatically  according to an ingenious system, and reach the hearer in due  succession. Furthermore, the hearers are free to listen only to what  specially concerns them. They may at pleasure give attention to one  editor and refuse it to another.    Mr. Smith next addresses one of the ten reporters in the astronomical  department--a department still in the embryonic stage, but which will  yet play an important part in journalism.    \"Well, Cash, what's the news?\"    \"We have phototelegrams from Mercury, Venus, and Mars.\"    \"Are those from Mars of any interest?\"    \"Yes, indeed. There is a revolution in the Central Empire.\"    \"And what of Jupiter?\" asked Mr. Smith.    \"Nothing as yet. We cannot quite understand their signals. Perhaps ours  do not reach them.\"    \"That's bad,\" exclaimed Mr. Smith, as he hurried away, not in the best  of humor, toward the hall of the scientific editors. With their heads bent down over their electric computers, thirty  scientific men were absorbed in transcendental calculations. The coming  of Mr. Smith was like the falling of a bomb among them.    \"Well, gentlemen, what is this I hear? No answer from Jupiter? Is it  always to be thus? Come, Cooley, you have been at work now twenty years  on this problem, and yet--\"    \"True enough,\" replied the man addressed. \"Our science of optics is  still very defective, and through our mile-and-three-quarter telescopes--\"    \"Listen to that, Peer,\" broke in Mr. Smith, turning to a second  scientist. \"Optical science defective! Optical science is your  specialty. But,\" he continued, again addressing William Cooley, \"failing  with Jupiter, are we getting any results from the moon?\"    \"The case is no better there.\"    \"This time you do not lay the blame on the science of optics. The moon  is immeasurably less distant than Mars, yet with Mars our communication  is fully established. I presume you will not say that you lack  telescopes?\"    \"Telescopes? O no, the trouble here is about--inhabitants!\"    \"That's it,\" added Peer.    \"So, then, the moon is positively uninhabited?\" asked Mr. Smith.    \"At least,\" answered Cooley, \"on the face which she presents to us. As  for the opposite side, who knows?\"    \"Ah, the opposite side! You think, then,\" remarked Mr. Smith, musingly,  \"that if one could but--\"    \"Could what?\"    \"Why, turn the moon about-face.\"    \"Ah, there's something in that,\" cried the two men at once. And indeed,  so confident was their air, they seemed to have no doubt as to the  possibility of success in such an undertaking.    \"Meanwhile,\" asked Mr. Smith, after a moment's silence, \"have you no  news of interest to-day?\"    \"Indeed we have,\" answered Cooley. \"The elements of Olympus are  definitively settled. That great planet gravitates beyond Neptune at the  mean distance of 11,400,799,642 miles from the sun, and to traverse its  vast orbit takes 1311 years, 294 days, 12 hours, 43 minutes, 9 seconds.\"    \"Why didn't you tell me that sooner?\" cried Mr. Smith. \"Now inform the  reporters of this straightway. You know how eager is the curiosity of  the public with regard to these astronomical questions. That news must  go into to-day's issue.\"    Then, the two men bowing to him, Mr. Smith passed into the next hall, an  enormous gallery upward of 3200 feet in length, devoted to atmospheric  advertising. Every one has noticed those enormous advertisements  reflected from the clouds, so large that they may be seen by the  populations of whole cities or even of entire countries. This, too, is  one of Mr. Fritz Napoleon Smith's ideas, and in the Earth Chronicle  building a thousand projectors are constantly engaged in displaying upon  the clouds these mammoth advertisements.    When Mr. Smith to-day entered the sky-advertising department, he found  the operators sitting with folded arms at their motionless projectors,  and inquired as to the cause of their inaction. In response, the man  addressed simply pointed to the sky, which was of a pure blue. \"Yes,\"  muttered Mr. Smith, \"a cloudless sky! That's too bad, but what's to be  done? Shall we produce rain? That we might do, but is it of any use?  What we need is clouds, not rain. Go,\" said he, addressing the head  engineer, \"go see Mr. Samuel Mark, of the meteorological division of the  scientific department, and tell him for me to go to work in earnest on  the question of artificial clouds. It will never do for us to be always  thus at the mercy of cloudless skies!\"    Mr. Smith's daily tour through the several departments of his newspaper  is now finished. Next, from the advertisement hall he passes to the  reception chamber, where the ambassadors accredited to the American  government are awaiting him, desirous of having a word of counsel or  advice from the all-powerful editor. A discussion was going on when he  entered. \"Your Excellency will pardon me,\" the French Ambassador was  saying to the Russian, \"but I see nothing in the map of Europe that  requires change. 'The North for the Slavs?' Why, yes, of course; but the  South for the Latins. Our common frontier, the Rhine, it seems to me,  serves very well. Besides, my government, as you must know, will firmly  oppose every movement, not only against Paris, our capital, or our two  great prefectures, Rome and Madrid, but also against the kingdom of  Jerusalem, the dominion of Saint Peter, of which France means to be the  trusty defender.\"    \"Well said!\" exclaimed Mr. Smith. \"How is it,\" he asked, turning to the  Russian ambassador, \"that you Russians are not content with your vast  empire, the most extensive in the world, stretching from the banks of  the Rhine to the Celestial Mountains and the Kara-Korum, whose shores  are washed by the Frozen Ocean, the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the  Indian Ocean? Then, what is the use of threats? Is war possible in view  of modern inventions--asphyxiating shells capable of being projected a  distance of 60 miles, an electric spark of 90 miles, that can at one  stroke annihilate a battalion; to say nothing of the plague, the  cholera, the yellow fever, that the belligerents might spread among  their antagonists mutually, and which would in a few days destroy the  greatest armies?\"    \"True,\" answered the Russian; \"but can we do all that we wish? As for us  Russians, pressed on our eastern frontier by the Chinese, we must at any  cost put forth our strength for an effort toward the west.\"    \"O, is that all? In that case,\" said Mr. Smith, \"the thing can be  arranged. I will speak to the Secretary of State about it. The attention  of the Chinese government shall be called to the matter. This is not the  first time that the Chinese have bothered us.\"    \"Under these conditions, of course--\" And the Russian ambassador  declared himself satisfied.    \"Ah, Sir John, what can I do for you?\" asked Mr. Smith as he turned to  the representative of the people of Great Britain, who till now had  remained "]]]
