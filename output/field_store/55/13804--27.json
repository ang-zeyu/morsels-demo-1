We have appointed two signs for the coming of age of the human     race #189  Glossary            PREFACE      In 1953 Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, included as one  of the goals of his Ten Year Plan the preparation of a Synopsis and  Codification of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitab-i-Aqdas as an  essential prelude to its translation. He himself worked on the  codification, but had not finished it when he died in 1957. The task was  continued on the basis of his work, and the resulting volume was released  in 1973. That publication included, in addition to the Synopsis and  Codification itself and explanatory notes, a compilation of the passages  from the Kitab-i-Aqdas which had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16528"],[0,"Forty-one years in India: from subaltern to commander-in-chief (#2)"],[1,"Power, and that her interests in that part of the globe  must be protected by Continental means of defence.    The few who have carefully and steadily watched the course of events,  entertained no doubt from the first as to the soundness of these  views; and their aim has always been, as mine is now, not to sound an  alarm, but to give a warning, and to show the danger of shutting our  eyes to plain facts and their probable consequences.    Whatever may be the future course of events, I have no fear of the  result if we are only true to ourselves and to India. Thinking Natives  thoroughly understand the situation; they believe that the time must  come when the territories of Great Britain and Russia in their part of  Asia will be separated only by a common boundary line, and they would  consider that we were wanting in the most essential attributes of  Rulers if we did not take all possible precautions, and make every  possible preparation to meet such an eventuality.    I send out this book in the earnest hope that the friendly  anticipations of those who advised me to write it may not be seriously  disappointed; and that those who care to read a plain, unvarnished  tale of Indian life and adventure, will bear in mind that the writer  is a soldier, not a man of letters, and will therefore forgive all  faults of style or language.
