It is the same with the animal. However much it may progress in its own  kingdom, however refined its feelings may become, it will have no real  notion of the world of man or of his special intellectual faculties.    The animal cannot understand the roundness of the earth, nor its motion in  space, nor the central position of the sun, nor can it imagine such a  thing as the all-pervading ether.    Although the mineral, vegetable, animal and man himself are actual beings,  the difference between their kingdoms prevents members of the lower degree  from comprehending the essence and nature of those of the superior degree.  This being so, how can the temporal and phenomenal comprehend the Lord of  Hosts?    It is clear that this is impossible!    But the Essence of Divinity, the Sun of Truth, shines forth upon all  horizons and is spreading its rays upon all things. Each creature is the  recipient of some portion of that power, and man, who contains the  perfection of the mineral, the vegetable and animal, as well as his own  distinctive qualities, has become the noblest of created beings. It stands  written that he is made in the Image of God. Mysteries that were hidden he  discovers; and secrets that were concealed he brings into the light. By  Science and by Art he brings hidden powers into the region of the visible  world. Man perceives the hidden law in created things and co-operates with  it.    Lastly the perfect man, the Prophet, is one who is transfigured, one who  has the purity and clearness of a perfect mirror--one who reflects the Sun  of Truth. Of such a one--of such a Prophet and Messenger--we can say that  the Light of Divinity with the heavenly Perfections dwells in him.    If we claim that the sun is seen in the mirror, we do not mean that the  sun itself has descended from the holy heights of his heaven and entered  into the mirror! This is impossible. The Divine Nature is seen in the  Manifestations and its Light and Splendor are visible in extreme glory.    Therefore, men have always been taught and led by the Prophets of God. The  Prophets of God are the Mediators of God. All the Prophets and Messengers  have come from One Holy Spirit and bear the Message of God, fitted to the  age in which they appear. The One Light is in them and they are One with  each other. But the Eternal does not become phenomenal; neither can the  phenomenal become Eternal.    Saint Paul, the great Apostle, said: \"We all, with open face beholding as  in a mirror the glory of God, are changed into the same image from glory  to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.\"    O GOD the Forgiver! O Heavenly Educator! This assembly is adorned with the  mention of thy holy Name. Thy children turn their face towards thy  Kingdom, hearts are made happy and souls are comforted.    Merciful God! cause us to repent of our shortcomings! Accept us in thy  heavenly Kingdom and give unto us an abode where there shall be no error.  Give us peace; give us knowledge, and open unto us the gates of thy  heaven.    Thou art the Giver of all! Thou art the Forgiver! Thou art the Merciful!  Amen.            THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY: INTRODUCTION      On September 30th, 'Abdu'l-Baha met the Theosophical society at their new  Headquarters at the express request of their president Mrs. Annie Besant.  After a general history of the movement and sympathetic words of welcome  by Mr. A. P. Sinnett, 'Abdu'l-Baha rose and delivered to the crowded  assembly an address upon the distinctive notes of the Baha'i teaching,  warmly commending the eagerness of the Society in its search for Truth.            DISCOURSE OF 'ABDU'L-BAHA GIVEN AT THE THEOSOPHICAL HEAD QUARTERS.                                September 30th, 1911.      O Respected Assembly! O friends of Truth! The inherent nature of fire is  to burn, the inherent nature of electricity is to give light, the inherent  nature of the sun is to shine, and the inherent nature of the organic  earth is the power of growth.    There is no separation between a thing and its inherent qualities.    It is the inherent nature of things on this earth to change, thus we see  around us the change of the seasons. Every spring is followed by a summer  and every autumn brings a winter--every day a night and every evening a  morning. There is a sequence in all things.    Thus when hatred and animosity, fighting, slaughtering, and great coldness  of heart were governing this world, and darkness had overcome the nations,  Baha'u'llah, like a bright star, rose from the horizon of Persia and shone  with the great Light of Guidance, giving heavenly radiance and  establishing the new Teaching.    He declared the most human virtues; He manifested the Spiritual powers,  and put them into practice in the world around Him.    Firstly: He lays stress on the search for Truth. This is most important,  because the people are too easily led by tradition. It is because of this  that they are often antagonistic to each other, and dispute with one  another.    But the manifesting of Truth discovers the darkness and becomes the cause  of Oneness of faith and belief: because Truth cannot be two! That is not  possible.    Secondly: Baha'u'llah taught the Oneness of humanity; that is to say, all  the children of men are under the mercy of the Great God. They are the  sons of one God; they are trained by God. He has placed the crown of  humanity on the head of every one of the servants of God. Therefore all  nations and peoples must consider themselves brethren. They are all  descendants from Adam. They are the branches, leaves, flowers and fruits  of One Tree. They are pearls from one shell. But the children of men are  in need of education and civilization, and they require to be polished,  till they become bright and shining.    Man and woman both should be educated equally and equally regarded.    It is racial, patriotic, religious and class prejudice, that has been the  cause of the destruction of Humanity.    Thirdly: Baha'u'llah taught, that Religion is the chief foundation of Love  and Unity and the cause of Oneness. If a religion become the cause of  hatred and disharmony, it would be better that it should not exist. To be  without such a religion is better than to be with it.    Fourthly: Religion and Science are inter-twined with each other and cannot  be separated. These are the two wings with which humanity must fly. One  wing is not enough. Every religion which does not concern itself with  Science is mere tradition, and that is not the essential. Therefore  science, education and civilization are most important necessities for the  full religious life.    Fifthly: The Reality of the divine Religions is one, because the Reality  is one and cannot be two. All the prophets are united in their message,  and unshaken. They are like the sun; in different seasons they ascend from  different rising points on the horizon. Therefore every ancient prophet  gave the glad tidings of the future, and every future has accepted the  past.    Sixthly: Equality and Brotherhood must be established among all members of  mankind. This is according to Justice. The general rights of mankind must  be guarded and preserved.    All men must be treated equally. This is inherent in the very nature of  humanity.    Seventhly: The arrangements of the circumstances of the people must be  such that poverty shall disappear, and that every one as far as possible,  according to his position and rank, shall be comfortable. Whilst the  nobles and others in high rank are in easy circumstances, the poor also  should be able to get their daily food and not be brought to the  extremities of hunger.    Eighthly: Baha'u'llah declared the coming of the Most Great Peace. All the  nations and peoples will come under the shadow of the Tent of the Great  Peace and Harmony--that is to say, by general election a Great Board of  Arbitration shall be established, to settle all differences and quarrels  between the Powers; so that disputes shall not end in war.    Ninthly: Baha'u'llah taught that hearts must receive the Bounty of the  Holy Spirit, so that Spiritual civilization may be established. For  material civilization is not adequate for the needs of mankind and cannot  be the cause of its happiness. Material civilization is like the body and  spiritual civilization is like the soul. Body without soul cannot live.    This is a short summary of the Teachings of Baha'u'llah. To establish this  Baha'u'llah underwent great difficulties and hardships. He was in constant  confinement and He suffered great persecution. But in the fortress (Akka)  He reared a spiritual palace and from the darkness of His prison He sent  out a great light to the world.    It is the ardent desire of the Baha'is to put these teachings into common  practice: and they will strive with soul and heart to give up their lives  for this purpose, until the heavenly light brightens the whole world of  humanity.    I am very happy that I have been able to talk with you in this gathering:  and hope that this deep consciousness of mine is acceptable to you.    I pray for you, that you may succeed in your aspirations and that the  bounties of the Kingdom may be yours.            FAREWELL RECEPTION: INTRODUCTION      On the evening of St. Michael's day, a large farewell reception was given  to 'Abdu'l-Baha in the hall of the Passmore Edwards' Settlement, which was  filled to its utmost capacity with representative people of every  profession, some coming from great distances.    On the platform surrounding 'Abdu'l-Baha were men of different shades of  thought, met to express their sympathy with the work and mission of their  great visitor. Professor Michael E. Sadler was in the chair.    The meeting began with the Lord's Prayer spoken by the entire assembly;  this was followed by the prayer for Unity of Baha'u'llah and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19251"],[0,"Arohanui: Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand (#2)"],[1,"3] It was nice that you saw  Shoghi's sister and Soheil's brother in London.    I forget whether I gave you the address of Mr and Mrs King, c/o Messrs  Hayman and King, 202 Old Christchurch Rd. Bournemouth. They are very  kind-hearted Baha'is and will be delighted to see any of you if you call.  Both of them work in the business and you are most likely to see them if  you call there. They live above the shop.    I gave you Sister Challis's address at West Moors (Ferndown Lodge). You  can get there by 'bus from Bournemouth Sq. or Lansdowne, which will drop  you right at Sister Challis's door (She keeps a nursing home) or you can  go by train from West Bournemouth to West Moors station which is within 5  minutes' walk of Ferndown Lodge. I hope you will be able to see her.    As I write, the Greatest Holy Leaf is on a visit to the Shrine of the  Master. It is over a year, I think, since she has been able to visit the  shrine and until now she has not seen the new Gardens, in the laying out  of which Shoghi Effendi has taken such a deep interest. The Gardens are  looking lovely now and it is easy to imagine how delighted she will be.  One day during the feast of Ridvan she and the Holy Mother were able to  visit Bahji and the Garden of Ridvan.    I have quite recovered from my pleurisy now and am steadily regaining my  strength.    Shoghi Effendi is still tired. I hope he will soon be able to take a rest.    All the friends here join in loving greetings and best wishes to yourself,  your son and daughter, Miss Stevenson and Effie Baker.[+E4] With warmest  greetings.    Your brother in the service of the Beloved,  J. E. Esslemont    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear precious sister in 'Abdu'l-Baha:_    _I was so glad to hear from you directly and learn of your improved health  and meeting with the English Baha'is. I need not assure you of my ardent  prayers for your happiness, good health and continued success in the  service of the Cause. I hope and pray you will be enabled by the guiding  spirit of the Master not only to stimulate the interest of your friends  and relations in this Cause but to make of some of them earnest and  whole-hearted believers and supporters of the Faith._    _Shoghi_          (3) May 9th, 1925      Allah-u-abha    Dear Baha'i Sister,    The Greatest Holy Leaf and Shoghi Effendi have asked me to answer on their  behalf your kind letters of Apr. 2nd from Port Said and April 14th from  London.    We were sorry to hear that Mrs Blundell got a chill on the steamer and was  laid up for a few days after her arrival in London. We hope that by this  time she is all right again. We had a note from her from Bournemouth.    You will be glad to hear that the Greatest Holy Leaf and the Holy Mother  were able to motor to Bahji and Ridvan one day during the Feast of Ridvan,  and that yesterday the Greatest Holy Leaf motored to the Shrine of  'Abdu'l-Baha and saw the new Gardens in which Shoghi Effendi has been  taking so much interest.    Yesterday a Dutchman arrived here from Port Said, the first Dutch Baha'i,  so far as we know. He has been a sincere and earnest truth-seeker for  years. About 9 months ago he left his home at the Hague and walked on foot  through Belgium, France and Italy. Then he felt some inward urge to go to  Egypt, and travelled thither by a Dutch Cargo Steamer. When the steamer  arrived at Port Said Mahmood Effendi, one of the Port Said Baha'is came on  board and was introduced to Mesdag (the Dutchman). They struck up a  friendship at once and after 2 days Mesdag went to live in Mahmood's  house. There he met Martha Root, Mr Schopflocher and various other  Baha'is, read my book and became thoroughly interested and seems now  already a firm believer. He has already, since his arrival yesterday  morning, translated our 8-page folder into Dutch and we hope he will be  able to do much to make the Cause known in Holland and win adherents  there.    I have quite recovered from my pleurisy now and am feeling almost as  vigorous as before the attack. Azizullah Bahadur is now in Stuttgart.  There is as yet no improvement in his hand, but he is having skilled  treatment now and we hope it will be successful. He seems to be having a  very happy time with the German friends.    Shoghi Effendi is much in need of rest, but fairly well. He and all the  members of the Holy Family join in loving greetings and heartfelt prayers  for your welfare. We hope you will have a fine time in England and return  to New Zealand refreshed and reinvigorated physically and spiritually to  take up your work for the Kingdom there with new enthusiasm and devotion.  We pray that you may always be guided and strengthened by the Divine  Confirmations.    With love also to Effie Baker and all the other friends,    Your brother in the service of the Beloved,  J. E. Esslemont    [From the Guardian:]    _My precious Baha'i sister:--_    _I wish to assure you personally of my appreciation of your devotion to  the Cause, and your earnest efforts to promote it as well as my fervent  prayers for your spiritual advancement, success and happiness. I will  always remember you most tenderly in my hours of visit at the three holy  Shrines and beseech for you and the New Zealand friends the blessings of  our loving and almighty Master._    _You true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (4) May 21st, 1925      Allah-u-abha    Dear Baha'i Brother,    Shoghi Effendi has asked me to reply to your kind letter of 11th April. He  is delighted to hear that you propose starting a Baha'i Magazine for  Australia and New Zealand and suggests as a suitable title \"The Herald of  the South\". Every 19 days a letter will be sent from Haifa to Mr and Mrs  Hyde Dunn giving the news of the Cause. Owing to the restricted facilities  for multiplying copies which are at present available here, I fear it will  not be possible to send another copy to you, but doubtless you can arrange  with Mr and Mrs Hyde Dunn to have their copy passed on to you for the  magazine. We are glad to hear that notwithstanding the absence of the  Blundells and Margaret Stevenson, the friends in New Zealand are remaining  united and active. We hope that when the pilgrims return the faith and  enthusiasm of the believers will be greatly deepened and strengthened and  that many new believers may be attracted. I had a long letter from Effie  Baker yesterday. She is very devoted and whole-hearted and will be a  valuable worker for the Cause, I think, and a great help to Father and  Mother Dunn. When she wrote, Margaret Stevenson had gone to Scotland and  Mrs and Miss Blundell were in Bournemouth. Effie Baker hopes to make a  return visit to Haifa on her way back to Australia.    Shoghi Effendi assures you of his prayers on behalf of your mother,  yourself and all the Australasian friends and his hopes that the proposed  Magazine may greatly help the spread of the Glad Tidings in Australia and  New Zealand.    With warmest greetings and best wishes,    Yours sincerely in the Master's service,  J. E. Esslemont    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear fellow-worker:_    _Your charming letter truly gladdened my heart. I will follow the  development of your magazine with keen interest and assure you of my  desire to help and promote its interests to the fullest possible extent. I  am enclosing the photographs of the shrine and gardens recently laid out  in the close neighbourhood of the Shrines of the Bab and 'Abdu'l-Baha. I  assure you of my love, appreciation and fervent prayers._    _Yours, _  _ Shoghi_          (5) May 28th, 1925      Allah-u-abha.    Dear Baha'i Sister,    Shoghi Effendi asks me to thank you on his behalf for your letter of 14th  May. He received the letter of Mrs. Amy Thornton all right. I remember  answering it for him some weeks ago, so you can set your mind at rest on  that score.    The recovery of your Baha'i ring and stones was very remarkable. It  reminds me of a somewhat similar occurrence in Bournemouth. One of our  Baha'i friends had her Baha'i ring stolen, and nothing was heard or seen  of it for some months. Mr King, another of our group, has an antique shop  in Bournemouth and one day his partner (a non-Baha'i) bought a ring from a  man who said it was his wife's, but as they had become very badly off she  wanted to sell it. When Mr King saw the ring he recognized it as a Baha'i  ring and knowing that this friend had lost her ring, he sent it to me. It  turned out to be her ring and she was delighted to recover it. The curious  thing is that out of the dozens of jewellers and antique shops in  Bournemouth to which the ring might have been taken for sale, it should be  taken to the one where there was a Baha'i who recognized it.    I hope that before you leave Scotland you may be able to go to Aberdeen  and see my home people. They would be delighted to see you. My father's  address is Fairford, Cults, (about 3 miles from Aberdeen, by car or  train). He is 86 years of age and rather frail. My sister looks after him.  My two married brothers are Peter Esslemont, 21, Louisville Avenue  (Business: John E. Esslemont, 16 King Street) and W.D.E., 12 Wellbrae  Terr., Mannofield. Both of their houses are near the Mannofield Car Line.    We were very glad to hear of your meetings with the friends at London and  West Moors.    Many thanks for your letter to myself and the excellent snap-shots  enclosed. I am glad you have fallen in love with Sister Challis and hope  you will see her again before you leave. I had a delightful letter  yesterday from Miss Kilford of West Moors, whom I regard as a Baha'i  grand-daughter, as she was brought into the Cause by Sister Challis who  calls me her Baha'i father!    We hope Shoghi Effendi will get away soon for a much needed rest. The  Greatest Holy Leaf was rather seriously ill last week, but is a good deal  better again, although very feeble and frail.    I have been advised by the Drs to leave Haifa for the summer months, as my"]]]
