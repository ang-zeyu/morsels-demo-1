Indeed, it had saved  him a great deal of trouble. So now he was perfectly willing to go right  on working and let his hidden visitors watch him until they were sure  that he meant them no harm. You see, he himself felt quite sure that  none of them was big enough to do him any harm. Little Joe Otter was  the only one he had any doubts about, and he felt quite sure that Little  Joe wouldn't try to pick a quarrel. So he kept right on cutting trees,  trimming off the branches, and hauling the trunks down to the dam he  was building. Some of them he floated down the Laughing Brook. This  was easier.    Now when the little people of the Smiling Pool, who were the first to  find out that Paddy the Beaver had come to the Green Forest, had started  up the Laughing Brook to see what he was doing, they had told the Merry  Little Breezes where they were going. The Merry Little Breezes had been  greatly excited. They couldn't understand how a stranger could have been  living in the Green Forest without their knowledge. You see, they quite  forgot that they very seldom wandered to the deepest part of the Green  Forest. Of course they started at once as fast as they could go to tell  all the other little people who live on or around the Green Meadows, all  but Old Man Coyote. For some reason they thought it best not to tell  him. They were a little doubtful about Old Man Coyote. He was so big and  strong and so sly and smart that all his neighbors were afraid of him.  Perhaps the Merry Little Breezes had this fact in mind, and knew that  none would dare go to call on the stranger if they knew that Old Man  Coyote was going too. Anyway, they simply passed the time of day with  Old Man Coyote and hurried on to tell every one else, and the very last  one they met was Sammy Jay.    Sammy was terribly put out to think that anything should be going on  that he didn't know about first. You know he is very fond of prying into  the affairs of other people, and he loves dearly to boast that there is  nothing going on in the Green Forest or on the Green Meadows that he  doesn't know about. So now his pride was hurt, and he was in a terrible  rage as he started after the Merry Little Breezes for the place deep in  the Green Forest where they said Paddy the Beaver was at work. He didn't  believe a word of it, but he would see for himself.          IV    SAMMY JAY SPEAKS HIS MIND      When Sammy Jay reached the place deep in the Green Forest where Paddy  the Beaver was so hard at work, he didn't hide as had the little  four-footed people. You see, of course, he had no reason to hide,  because he felt perfectly safe. Paddy had just cut a big tree, and it  fell with a crash as Sammy came hurrying up. Sammy was so surprised  that for a minute he couldn't find his tongue. He had not supposed  that anybody but Farmer Brown or Farmer Brown's boy could cut down so  large a tree as that, and it quite took his breath away. But he got it  again in a minute. He was boiling with anger, anyway, to think that he  should have been the last to learn that Paddy had come down from the  North to make his home in the Green Forest, and here was a chance to  speak his mind.    \"Thief! thief! thief!\" he screamed in his harshest voice.    Paddy the Beaver looked up with a twinkle in his eyes. \"Hello, Mr. Jay!  I see you haven't any better manners than your cousin who lives up where  I came from,\" said he.    \"Thief! thief! thief!\" screamed Sammy, hopping up and down, he was  so angry.    \"Meaning yourself, I suppose,\" said Paddy. \"I never did see an honest  Jay, and I don't suppose I ever will.\"    \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Peter Rabbit, who had quite forgotten that he  was hiding.    \"Oh, how do you do, Mr. Rabbit? I'm very glad you have called on me this  morning,\" said Paddy, just as if he hadn't known all the time just where  Peter was. \"Mr. Jay seems to have gotten out of the wrong side of his  bed this morning.\"    Peter laughed again. \"He always does,\" said he. \"If he didn't, he  wouldn't be happy. You wouldn't think it to look at him, but he is happy  right now. He doesn't know it, but he is. He always is happy when he can  show what a bad temper he has.\"    Sammy Jay glared down at Peter. Then he glared at Paddy. And all the  time he still shrieked \"Thief!\" as hard as ever he could. Paddy kept  right on working, paying no attention to Sammy. This made Sammy more  angry than ever. He kept coming nearer and nearer until at last he  was in the very tree that Paddy happened to be cutting. Paddy's  eyes twinkled.    \"I'm no thief!\" he exclaimed suddenly.    \"You are! You are! Thief! Thief!\" shrieked Sammy. \"You're stealing  our trees!\"    \"They're not your trees,\" retorted Paddy. \"They belong to the Green  Forest, and the Green Forest belongs to all who love it, and we all have  a perfect right to take what we need from it. I need these trees, and  I've just as much right to take them as you have to take the fat acorns  that drop in the fall.\"    \"No such thing!\" screamed Sammy. You know he can't talk without  screaming, and the more excited he gets, the louder he screams. \"No such  thing! Acorns are food. They are meant to eat. I have to have them to  live. But you are cutting down whole trees. You are spoiling the Green  Forest. You don't belong here. Nobody invited you, and nobody wants you.  You're a thief!\"    Then up spoke Jerry Muskrat, who, you know, is cousin to Paddy  the Beaver.    \"Don't you mind him,\" said he, pointing at Sammy Jay. \"Nobody does.  He's the greatest trouble-maker in the Green Forest or on the Green  Meadows. He would steal from his own relatives. Don't mind what he  says, Cousin Paddy.\"    Now all this time Paddy had been working away just as if no one was  around. Just as Jerry stopped speaking, Paddy thumped the ground with  his tail, which is his way of warning people to watch out, and suddenly  scurried away as fast as he could run. Sammy Jay was so surprised that  he couldn't find his tongue for a minute, and he didn't notice anything  peculiar about that tree. Then suddenly he felt himself falling. With a  frightened scream, he spread his wings to fly, but branches of the tree  swept him down with them right into the Laughing Brook.    You see while Sammy had been speaking his mind, Paddy the Beaver had cut  down the very tree in which he was sitting.    Sammy wasn't hurt, but he was wet and muddy and terribly  frightened,--the most miserable looking Jay that ever was seen.  It was too much for all the little people who were hiding. They  just had to laugh. Then they all came out to pay their respects  to Paddy the Beaver.          V    PADDY KEEPS HIS PROMISE      Paddy the Beaver kept right on working just as if he hadn't any  visitors. You see, it is a big undertaking to build a dam. And when that  was done there was a house to build and a supply of food for the winter  to cut and store. Oh, Paddy the Beaver had no time for idle gossip, you  may be sure! So he kept right on building his dam. It didn't look much  like a dam at first, and some of Paddy's visitors turned up their noses  when they first saw it. They had heard stories of what a wonderful  dam-builder Paddy was, and they had expected to see something like the  smooth, grass-covered bank with which Farmer Brown kept the Big River  from running back on his low lands. Instead, all they saw was a great  pile of poles and sticks which looked like anything but a dam.    \"Pooh!\" exclaimed Billy Mink, \"I guess we needn't worry about the  Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool, if that is the best Paddy can do.  Why, the water of the Laughing Brook will work through that in no time.\"    Of course Paddy heard him, but he said nothing, just kept right  on working.    \"Just look at the way he has laid those sticks!\" continued Billy Mink.  \"Seems as if any one would know enough to lay them _across_ the Laughing  Brook instead of just the other way. I could build a better dam  than that.\"    Paddy said nothing; he just kept right on working.    \"Yes, Sir,\" Billy boasted. \"I could build a better dam than that. Why,  that pile of sticks will never stop the water.\"    \"Is something the matter with your eyesight, Billy Mink?\" inquired  Jerry Muskrat.    \"Of course not!\" retorted Billy indignantly. \"Why?\"    \"Oh, nothing much, only you don't seem to notice that already the  Laughing Brook is over its banks above Paddy's dam,\" replied Jerry,  who had been studying the dam with a great deal of interest.    Billy looked a wee bit foolish, for sure enough there was a little pool  just above the dam, and it was growing bigger.    Paddy still kept at work, saying nothing. He was digging in front of  the dam now, and the mud and grass he dug up he stuffed in between the  ends of the sticks and patted down with his hands. He did this all along  the front of the dam and on top of it too, wherever he thought it was  needed. Of course this made it harder for the water to work through, and  the little pond above the dam began to grow faster. It wasn't a great  while before it was nearly to the top of the dam, which at first was  very low. Then Paddy brought more sticks. This was easier now, because  he could float them down from where he was cutting. He would put them in  place on the top of the dam, then hurry for more. Wherever it was  needed, he would put in mud. He even rolled a few stones in to help hold  the mass.    So the dam grew and grew, and so did the pond above the dam. Of course,  it took a good many days to build so big a dam, and a lot of hard work!  Every morning the little people of the Green Forest and the Green  Meadows would visit it, and every morning they would find that it  had grown a great deal in the night, for that is when Paddy likes  best to work.

It has been an instinct in nearly all peoples, savage or civilized, to  set aside certain days for special ceremonial observances, attended by  outward rejoicing. This tendency to concentrate on special times answers  to man's need to lift himself above the commonplace and the everyday, to  escape from the leaden weight of monotony that oppresses him. \"We tend to  tire of the most eternal splendours, and a mark on our calendar, or a  crash of bells at midnight maybe, reminds us that we have only recently  been created.\"[1]{1} That they wake people up is the great justification  of festivals, and both man's religious sense and his joy in life have  generally tended to rise \"into peaks and towers and turrets, into  superhuman exceptions which really prove the rule.\"{2} It is difficult  to be religious, impossible to be merry, at every moment of life, and  festivals are as sunlit peaks, testifying, above dark valleys, to the  eternal radiance. This is one view of the purpose and value of festivals,  and their function of cheering people and giving them larger perspectives  has no doubt been an important reason for their maintenance in the past.  If we could trace the custom of festival-keeping back to its origins in  primitive society |18| we should find the same principle of  specialization involved, though it is probable that the practice came  into being not for the sake of its moral or emotional effect, but from  man's desire to lay up, so to speak, a stock of sanctity, magical not  ethical, for ordinary days.    The first holy-day-makers were probably more concerned with such material  goods as food than with spiritual ideals, when they marked with sacred  days the rhythm of the seasons.{3} As man's consciousness developed, the  subjective aspect of the matter would come increasingly into prominence,  until in the festivals of the Christian Church the main object is to  quicken the devotion of the believer by contemplation of the mysteries of  the faith. Yet attached, as we shall see, to many Christian festivals,  are old notions of magical sanctity, probably quite as potent in the  minds of the common people as the more spiritual ideas suggested by the  Church's feasts.    In modern England we have almost lost the festival habit, but if there is  one feast that survives among us as a universal tradition it is  Christmas. We have indeed our Bank Holidays, but they are mere days of  rest and amusement, and for the mass of the people Easter and Whitsuntide  have small religious significance--Christmas alone has the character of  sanctity which marks the true festival. The celebration of Christmas has  often little or nothing to do with orthodox dogma, yet somehow the sense  of obligation to keep the feast is very strong, and there are few English  people, however unconventional, who escape altogether the spell of  tradition in this matter.    _Christmas_--how many images the word calls up: we think of carol-singers  and holly-decked churches where people hymn in time-honoured strains the  Birth of the Divine Child; of frost and snow, and, in contrast, of warm  hearths and homes bright with light and colour, very fortresses against  the cold; of feasting and revelry, of greetings and gifts exchanged; and  lastly of vaguely superstitious customs, relics of long ago, performed  perhaps out of respect for use and wont, or merely in jest, or with a  deliberate attempt to throw ourselves back into the past, to re-enter for  a moment the mental childhood of the race. These are a few of |19| the  pictures that rise pell-mell in the minds of English folk at the mention  of Christmas; how many other scenes would come before us if we could  realize what the festival means to men of other nations. Yet even these  will suggest what hardly needs saying, that Christmas is something far  more complex than a Church holy-day alone, that the celebration of the  Birth of Jesus, deep and touching as is its appeal to those who hold the  faith of the Incarnation, is but one of many elements that have entered  into the great winter festival.    In the following pages I shall try to present a picture, sketchy and  inadequate though it must be, of what Christmas is and has been to the  peoples of Europe, and to show as far as possible the various elements  that have gone into its make-up. Most people have a vague impression that  these are largely pagan, but comparatively few have any idea of the  process by which the heathen elements have become mingled with that which  is obviously Christian, and equal obscurity prevails as to the nature and  meaning of the non-Christian customs. The subject is vast, and has not  been thoroughly explored as yet, but the labours of historians and  folk-lorists have made certain conclusions probable, and have produced  hypotheses of great interest and fascination.    I have spoken of \"Christian\"[2] and \"pagan\" elements. The distinction is  blurred to some extent by the clothing of heathen customs in a  superficial Christianity, but on the whole it is clear enough to justify  the division of this book into two parts, one dealing with the Church's  feast of the Holy Birth, the other with those remains of pagan winter  festivals which extend from November to January, but cluster especially  round Christmas and the Twelve Days.           *   "]]]
