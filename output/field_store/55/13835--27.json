And to-morrow must she die,  unless some brave knight will slay the monster. To such will the King  give his daughter in marriage, and the crown of Egypt in due time.\"    \"For crowns I care not,\" said St. George boldly, \"but the beauteous  maiden shall not die. I will slay the monster.\"    So, rising at dawn of day, he buckled on his armour, laced his helmet,  and with the falchion Ascalon in his hand, bestrode Bayard, and rode  into the Valley of the Dragon. Now on the way he met a procession of old  women weeping and wailing, and in their midst the most beauteous damsel  he had ever seen. Moved by compassion he dismounted, and bowing low  before the lady entreated her to return to her father's palace, since he  was about to kill the dreaded dragon. Whereupon the beautiful Sabia,  thanking him with smiles and tears, did as he requested, and he,  re-mounting, rode on his emprise.    Now, no sooner did the dragon catch sight of the brave Knight than its  leathern throat sent out a sound more terrible than thunder, and  weltering from its hideous den, it spread its burning wings and prepared  to assail its foe.    Its size and appearance might well have made the stoutest heart tremble.  From shoulder to tail ran full forty feet, its body was covered with  silver scales, its belly was as gold, and through its flaming wings the  blood ran thick and red.    So fierce was its onset, that at the very first encounter the Knight was  nigh felled to the ground; but recovering himself he gave the dragon  such a thrust with his spear that the latter shivered to a thousand  pieces; whereupon the furious monster smote him so violently with its  tail that both horse and rider were overthrown.    Now, by great good chance, St. George was flung under the shade of a  flowering orange tree, whose fragrance hath this virtue in it, that no  poisonous beast dare come within the compass of its branches. So there  the valiant knight had time to recover his senses, until with eager  courage he rose, and rushing to the combat, smote the burning dragon on  his burnished belly with his trusty sword Ascalon; and thereinafter  spouted out such black venom, as, falling on the armour of the Knight,  burst it in twain. And ill might it have fared with St. George of Merrie  England but for the orange tree, which once again gave him shelter under  its branches, where, seeing the issue of the fight was in the Hands of  the Most High, he knelt and prayed that such strength of body should be  given him as would enable him to prevail. Then with a bold and  courageous heart, he advanced again, and smote the fiery dragon under  one of his flaming wings, so that the weapon pierced the heart, and all  the grass around turned crimson with the blood that flowed from the  dying monster. So St. George of England cut off the dreadful head, and  hanging it on a truncheon made of the spear which at the beginning of  the combat had shivered against the beast's scaly back, he mounted his  steed Bayard, and proceeded to the palace of the King.    Now the King's name was Ptolemy, and when he saw that the dreaded dragon  was indeed slain, he gave orders for the city to be decorated. And he  sent a golden chariot with wheels of ebony and cushions of silk to bring  St. George to the palace, and commanded a hundred nobles dressed in  crimson velvet, and mounted on milk-white steeds richly caparisoned, to  escort him thither with all honour, while musicians walked before and  after, filling the air with sweetest sounds.    Now the beautiful Sabia herself washed and dressed the weary Knight's  wounds, and gave him in sign of betrothal a diamond ring of purest  water. Then, after he had been invested by the King with the golden  spurs of knighthood and had been magnificently feasted, he retired to  rest his weariness, while the beautiful Sabia from her balcony lulled  him to sleep with her golden lute.    So all seemed happiness; but alas! dark misfortune was at hand.    Almidor, the black King of Morocco, who had long wooed the Princess  Sabia in vain, without having the courage to defend her, seeing that the  maiden had given her whole heart to her champion, resolved to compass  his destruction.    So, going to King Ptolemy, he told him--what was perchance true--namely,  that the beauteous Sabia had promised St. George to become Christian,  and follow him to England. Now the thought of this so enraged the King  that, forgetting his debt of honour, he determined on an act of basest  treachery.    Telling St. George that his love and loyalty needed further trial, he  entrusted him with a message to the King of Persia, and forbade him  either to take with him his horse Bayard or his sword Ascalon; nor would  he even allow him to say farewell to his beloved Sabia.    St. George then set forth sorrowfully, and surmounting many dangers,  reached the Court of the King of Persia in safety; but what was his  anger to find that the secret missive he bore contained nothing but an  earnest request to put the bearer of it to death. But he was helpless,  and when sentence had been passed upon him, he was thrown into a loathly  dungeon, clothed in base and servile weeds, and his arms strongly  fettered up to iron bolts, while the roars of the two hungry lions who  were to devour him ere long, deafened his ears. Now his rage and fury at  this black treachery was such that it gave him strength, and with mighty  effort he drew the staples that held his fetters; so being part free he  tore his long locks of amber-coloured hair from his head and wound them  round his arms instead of gauntlets. So prepared he rushed on the lions  when they were let loose upon him, and thrusting his arms down their  throats choked them, and thereinafter tearing out their very hearts,  held them up in triumph to the gaolers who stood by trembling with fear.    After this the King of Persia gave up the hopes of putting St. George to  death, and, doubling the bars of the dungeon, left him to languish  therein. And there the unhappy Knight remained for seven long years, his  thoughts full of his lost Princess; his only companions rats and mice  and creeping worms, his only food and drink bread made of the coarsest  bran and dirty water.    At last one day, in a dark corner of his dungeon, he found one of the  iron staples he had drawn in his rage and fury. It was half consumed  with rust, yet it was sufficient in his hands to open a passage through  the walls of his cell into the King's garden. It was the time of night  when all things are silent; but St. George, listening, heard the voices  of grooms in the stables; which, entering, he found two grooms  furnishing forth a horse against some business. Whereupon, taking the  staple with which he had redeemed himself from prison, he slew the  grooms, and mounting the palfrey rode boldly to the city gates, where he  told the watchman at the Bronze Tower that St. George having escaped  from the dungeon, he was in hot pursuit of him. Whereupon the gates were  thrown open, and St. George, clapping spurs to his horse, found himself  safe from pursuit before the first red beams of the sun shot up into the  sky.    Now, ere long, being most famished with hunger, he saw a tower set on a  high cliff, and riding thitherward determined to ask for food. But as he  neared the castle he saw a beauteous damsel in a blue and gold robe  seated disconsolate at a window. Whereupon, dismounting, he called aloud  to her:    \"Lady! If thou hast sorrow of thine own, succour one also in distress,  and give me, a Christian Knight, now almost famished, one meal's meat.\"  To which she replied quickly:    \"Sir Knight! Fly quickly as thou canst, for my lord is a mighty giant, a  follower of Mahomed, who hath sworn to destroy all Christians.\"    Hearing this St. George laughed loud and long. \"Go tell him then, fair  dame,\" he cried, \"that a Christian Knight waits at his door, and will  either satisfy his wants within his castle or slay the owner thereof.\"    Now the giant no sooner heard this valiant challenge than he rushed  forth to the combat, armed with a hugeous crowbar of iron. He was a  monstrous giant, deformed, with a huge head, bristled like any boar's,  with hot, glaring eyes and a mouth equalling a tiger's. At first sight  of him St. George gave himself up for lost, not so much for fear, but  for hunger and faintness of body. Still, commending himself to the Most  High, he also rushed to the combat with such poor arms as he had, and  with many a regret for the loss of his magic sword Ascalon. So they  fought till noon, when, just as the champion's strength was nigh  finished, the giant stumbled on the root of a tree, and St. George,  taking his chance, ran him through the mid-rib, so that he gasped and  died.    After which St. George entered the tower; whereat the beautiful lady,  freed from her terrible lord, set before him all manner of delicacies  and pure wine with which he sufficed his hunger, rested his weary body,  and refreshed his horse.    So, leaving the tower in the hands of the grateful lady, he went on his  way, coming ere long to the Enchanted Garden of the necromancer  Ormadine, where, embedded in the living rock, he saw a magic sword, the  like of which for beauty he had never seen, the belt being beset with  jaspers and sapphire stones, while the pommel was a globe of the purest  silver chased in gold with these verses:      My magic will remain most firmly bound    Till that a knight from the far north be found    To pull this sword from out its bed of stone.    Lo! when he comes wise Ormadine must fall.    Farewell, my magic power, my spell, my all.    Seeing this St. George put his hand to the hilt, thinking to essay  pulling it out by strength; but lo! he drew it out with as much ease as  though it had hung"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17042"],[0,"Illustration of the Method of Recording Indian Languages (#2)"],[1,"morning he went, a person with  very long feet had been along, leaving a trail. And he (the Rabbit),  wished to know him. \"Now,\" thought he, \"I will go in advance of the  person.\" Having arisen very early in the morning, he departed. Again  it happened that the person had been along, leaving a trail. Then he  (the Rabbit) went home. Said he, \"Grandmother, though I arrange for  myself to go first, a person anticipates me (every time). Grandmother,  I will make a snare and catch him.\" \"Why should you do it?\" said she.  \"I hate the person,\" he said. And the Rabbit departed. When he went,  the foot-prints had been along again. And he lay waiting for night (to  come). And he made a noose of a bow-string, putting it in the place  where the foot-prints used to be seen. And he reached there very early  in the morning for the purpose of looking at his trap. And it happened  that he had caught the Sun. Running very fast, he went homeward to  tell it. \"Grandmother, I have caught something or other, but it  scares me. Grandmother, I wished to take my bow-string, but I was  scared every time,\" said he. He went thither with a knife. And he got  very near it. \"You have done wrong; why have you done so? Come hither  and untie me,\" said the Sun. The Rabbit, although he went thither, was  afraid, and kept on passing partly by him (or, continued going by a  little to one side). And making a rush, with his head bent down (and  his arm stretched out), he cut the bow-string with the knife. And the  Sun had already gone on high. And the Rabbit had the hair between his  shoulders scorched yellow, it having been hot upon him (as he stooped  to cut the bow-string). (And the Rabbit arrived at home.) \"Itcitci+!!  O grandmother, the heat has left nothing of me,\" said he. She said,  \"Oh! my grandchild! I think that the heat has left nothing of him for  me.\" (From that time the rabbit has had a singed spot on his back,  between the shoulders.)           *       *       *       *       *          DETAILS OF A CONJURER'S PRACTICE.

The meaning of the sentence  is: they raise their voices to call him out. Conjurers are in the habit of  fastening a fox-skin outside of their lodges, as a business sign, and  to let it dangle from a rod stuck out in an oblique direction.    583, 3. tch[/e]l[x]a. During the treatment of a patient, who stays in  a winter house, the lodge is often shut up at the top, and the people  sit in a circle inside in utter darkness.    583, 5. liuki[/a]mnank. The women and all who take a part in the chorus  usually sit in a circle around the conjurer and his assistant; the  suffix -mna indicates close proximity. Nadsh[=a]'shak qualifies the  verb win[/o]ta.    583, 5. tch[^u]tchtn[/i]shash. The distributive form of tch[^u]'t[']na refers  to each of the _various_ manipulations performed by the conjurer on  the patient.    584, 1. m[=a]'shish, shortened from m[=a]sh[/i]pkash, m[=a]'shipksh, like  [k=]'l[:a]'ksh from k[']l[:a]k[/a]pkash.    584, 2. 3. There is a stylistic incongruity in using the distributive  form, only in kuku[`a]ga (k[/u]e, _frog_), k[/a]haktok, and in nshendshk[/a]ne  (nshek[/a]ni, npsh[/e]kani, ts[/e]kani, tch[/e]k[)e]ni, _small_), while  inserting the absolute form in wishink[/a]ga (w[/i]shink, _garter-snake_) and  in [k=][/a][k=]o; m[^u]'lkaga is more of a generic term and its distributive  form is therefore not in use.    583, 2. k[/a]haktok for k[/a]-akt ak; k[/a]-akt being the transposed  distributive form k[/a]kat, of k[/a]t, which, what (pron. relat.).    584, 4. lg[^u]'m. The application of remedial _drugs_ is very unfrequent  in this tribe; and this is one of the reasons why the term \"conjurer\"  or \"shaman\" will prove to be a better name for the medicine man than  that of \"Indian doctor\".    584, 4. k[^u]'tash etc. The conjurer introduces a louse into the eye to  make it eat up the protruding white portion of the sore eye.
