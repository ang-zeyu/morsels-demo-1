[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16287"],[0,"Talks To Teachers On Psychology; And To Students On Some Of Life's Ideals (#2)"],[1,"is  perhaps no more promising feature than the fermentation which for a  dozen years or more has been going on among the teachers. In whatever  sphere of education their functions may lie, there is to be seen among  them a really inspiring amount of searching of the heart about the  highest concerns of their profession. The renovation of nations begins  always at the top, among the reflective members of the State, and  spreads slowly outward and downward. The teachers of this country, one  may say, have its future in their hands. The earnestness which they at  present show in striving to enlighten and strengthen themselves is an  index of the nation's probabilities of advance in all ideal directions.  The outward organization of education which we have in our United States  is perhaps, on the whole, the best organization that exists in any  country. The State school systems give a diversity and flexibility, an  opportunity for experiment and keenness of competition, nowhere else to  be found on such an important scale. The independence of so many of the  colleges and universities; the give and take of students and instructors  between them all; their emulation, and their happy organic relations to  the lower schools; the traditions of instruction in them, evolved from  the older American recitation-method (and so avoiding on the one hand  the pure lecture-system prevalent in Germany and Scotland, which  considers too little the individual student, and yet not involving the  sacrifice of the instructor to the individual student, which the English  tutorial system would seem too often to entail),--all these things (to  say nothing of that coeducation of the sexes in whose benefits so many  of us heartily believe), all these things, I say, are most happy  features of our scholastic life, and from them the most sanguine  auguries may be drawn.    Having so favorable an organization, all we need is to impregnate it  with geniuses, to get superior men and women working more and more  abundantly in it and for it and at it, and in a generation or two  America may well lead the education of the world. I must say that I look  forward with no little confidence to the day when that shall be an  accomplished fact.    No one has profited more by the fermentation of which I speak, in  pedagogical circles, than we psychologists. The desire of the  schoolteachers for a completer professional training, and their  aspiration toward the 'professional' spirit in their work, have led them  more and more to turn to us for light on fundamental principles. And in  these few hours which we are to spend together you look to me, I am  sure, for information concerning the mind's operations, which may enable  you to labor more easily and effectively in the several schoolrooms over  which you preside.    Far be it from me to disclaim for psychology all title to such hopes.  Psychology ought certainly to give the teacher radical help. And yet I  confess that, acquainted as I am with the height of some of your  expectations, I feel a little anxious lest, at the end of these simple  talks of mine, not a few of you may experience some disappointment at  the net results. In other words, I am not sure that you may not be  indulging fancies that are just a shade exaggerated. That would not be  altogether astonishing, for we have been having something like a 'boom'  in psychology in this country. Laboratories and professorships have been  founded, and reviews established. The air has been full of rumors. The  editors of educational journals and the arrangers of conventions have  had to show themselves enterprising and on a level with the novelties of  the day. Some of the professors have not been unwilling to co-operate,  and I am not sure even that the publishers have been entirely inert.  'The new psychology' has thus become a term to conjure up portentous  ideas withal; and you teachers, docile and receptive and aspiring as  many of you are, have been plunged in an atmosphere of vague talk about  our science, which to a great extent has been more mystifying than  enlightening. Altogether it does seem as if there were a certain  fatality of mystification laid upon the teachers of our day. The matter  of their profession, compact enough in itself, has to be frothed up for  them in journals and institutes, till its outlines often threaten to be  lost in a kind of vast uncertainty. Where the disciples are not  independent and critical-minded enough (and I think that, if you  teachers in the earlier grades have any defect--the slightest touch of a  defect in the world--it is that you are a mite too docile), we are  pretty sure to miss accuracy and balance and measure in those who get a  license to lay down the law to them from above.    As regards this subject of psychology, now, I wish at the very threshold  to do what I can to dispel the mystification. So I say at once that in  my humble opinion there _is_ no 'new psychology' worthy of the name.  There is nothing but the old psychology which began in Locke's time,  plus a little physiology of the brain and senses and theory of  evolution, and a few refinements of introspective detail, for the most  part without adaptation to the teacher's use. It is only the fundamental  conceptions of psychology which are of real value to the teacher; and  they, apart from the aforesaid theory of evolution, are very far from  being new.--I trust that you will see better what I mean by this at the  end of all these talks.    I say moreover that you make a great, a very great mistake, if you think  that psychology, being the science of the mind's laws, is something from  which you can deduce definite programmes and schemes and methods of  instruction for immediate schoolroom use. Psychology is a science, and  teaching is an art; and sciences never generate arts directly out of  themselves. An intermediary inventive mind must make the application, by  using its originality.    The science of logic never made a man reason rightly, and the science of  ethics (if there be such a thing) never made a man behave rightly. The  most such sciences can do is to help us to catch ourselves up and check  ourselves, if we start to reason or to behave wrongly; and to criticise  ourselves more articulately after we have made mistakes. A science only  lays down lines within which the rules of the art must fall, laws which  the follower of the art must not transgress; but what particular thing  he shall positively do within those lines is left exclusively to his own  genius. One genius will do his work well and succeed in one way, while  another succeeds as well quite differently; yet neither will transgress  the lines.    The art of teaching grew up in the schoolroom, out of inventiveness and  sympathetic concrete observation. Even where (as in the case of Herbart)  the advancer of the art was also a psychologist, the pedagogics and the  psychology ran side by side, and the former was not derived in any sense  from the latter. The two were congruent, but neither was subordinate.  And so everywhere the teaching must _agree_ with the psychology, but  need not necessarily be the only kind of teaching that would so agree;  for many diverse methods of teaching may equally well agree with  psychological laws.    To know psychology, therefore, is absolutely no guarantee that we shall  be good teachers. To advance to that result, we must have an additional  endowment altogether, a happy tact and ingenuity to tell us what  definite things to say and do when the pupil is before us. That  ingenuity in meeting and pursuing the pupil, that tact for the concrete  situation, though they are the alpha and omega of the teacher's art, are  things to which psychology cannot help us in the least.    The science of psychology, and whatever science of general pedagogics  may be based on it, are in fact much like the science of war. Nothing is  simpler or more definite than the principles of either. In war, all you  have to do is to work your enemy into a position from which the natural  obstacles prevent him from escaping if he tries to; then to fall on him  in numbers superior to his own, at a moment when you have led him to  think you far away; and so, with a minimum of exposure of your own  troops, to hack his force to pieces, and take the remainder prisoners.  Just so, in teaching, you must simply work your pupil into such a state  of interest in what you are going to teach him that every other object  of attention is banished from his mind; then reveal it to him so  impressively that he will remember the occasion to his dying day; and  finally fill him with devouring curiosity to know what the next steps in  connection with the subject are. The principles being so plain, there  would be nothing but victories for the masters of the science, either on  the battlefield or in the schoolroom, if they did not both have to make  their application to an incalculable quantity in the shape of the mind  of their opponent. The mind of your own enemy, the pupil, is working  away from you as keenly and eagerly as is the mind of the commander on  the other side from the scientific general. Just what the respective  enemies want and think, and what they know and do not know, are as hard  things for the teacher as for the general to find out. Divination and  perception, not psychological pedagogics or theoretic strategy, are the  only helpers here.    But, if the use of psychological principles thus be negative rather than  positive, it does not follow that it may not be a great use, all the  same. It certainly narrows the path for experiments and trials. We know  in advance, if we are psychologists, that certain methods will be wrong,  so our psychology saves us from mistakes. It makes us, moreover, more  clear as to what we are about. We gain confidence in respect to any  method which we are using as soon as we believe that it has theory as  well as practice"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16295"],[0,"The Vedanta-Sutras with the Commentary (#2)"],[1," a few remarks on the subject  will, however, be made later on. Their outward form is that common to  all the so-called Sutras which aims at condensing a given body of  doctrine in a number of concise aphoristic sentences, and often even  mere detached words in lieu of sentences. Besides the Mima/m/sa-sutras  this literary form is common to the fundamental works on the other  philosophic systems, on the Vedic sacrifices, on domestic ceremonies, on  sacred law, on grammar, and on metres. The two Mima/m/sa-sutras occupy,  however, an altogether exceptional position in point of style. All  Sutras aim at conciseness; that is clearly the reason to which this  whole species of literary composition owes its existence. This their aim  they reach by the rigid exclusion of all words which can possibly be  spared, by the careful avoidance of all unnecessary repetitions, and, as  in the case of the grammatical Sutras, by the employment of an  arbitrarily coined terminology which substitutes single syllables for  entire words or combination of words. At the same time the manifest  intention of the Sutra writers is to express themselves with as much  clearness as the conciseness affected by them admits of. The aphorisms  are indeed often concise to excess, but not otherwise intrinsically  obscure, the manifest care of the writers being to retain what is  essential in a given phrase, and to sacrifice only what can be supplied,  although perhaps not without difficulty, and an irksome strain of memory  and reflection. Hence the possibility of understanding without a  commentary a very considerable portion at any rate of the ordinary  Sutras. Altogether different is the case of the two Mima/m/sa-sutras.  There scarcely one single Sutra is intelligible without a commentary.  The most essential words are habitually dispensed with; nothing is, for  instance, more common than the simple ommission of the subject or  predicate of a sentence. And when here and there a Sutra occurs whose  words construe without anything having to be supplied, the phraseology  is so eminently vague and obscure that without the help derived from a  commentary we should be unable to make out to what subject the Sutra  refers. When undertaking to translate either of the Mima/m/sa-sutras we  therefore depend altogether on commentaries; and hence the question  arises which of the numerous commentaries extant is to be accepted as a  guide to their right understanding.    The commentary here selected for translation, together with  Badaraya/n/a's Sutras (to which we shall henceforth confine our  attention to the exclusion of Jaimini's Purva Mima/m/sa-sutras), is the  one composed by the celebrated theologian /S/a@nkara or, as he is  commonly called, /S/a@nkara/k/arya. There are obvious reasons for this  selection. In the first place, the /S/a@nkara-bhashya represents the  so-called orthodox side of Brahminical theology which strictly upholds  the Brahman or highest Self of the Upanishads as something different  from, and in fact immensely superior to, the divine beings such as  Vish/n/u or Siva, which, for many centuries, have been the chief objects  of popular worship in India. In the second place, the doctrine advocated  by /S/a@nkara is, from a purely philosophical point of view and apart  from all theological considerations, the most important and interesting  one which has arisen on Indian soil; neither those forms of the Vedanta  which diverge from the view represented by /S/a@nkara nor any of the  non-Vedantic systems can be compared with the so-called orthodox Vedanta  in boldness, depth, and subtlety of speculation. In the third place,  /S/a@nkara's bhaashya is, as far as we know, the oldest of the extant  commentaries, and relative antiquity is at any rate one of the  circumstances which have to be taken into account, although, it must be  admitted, too much weight may easily be attached to it. The  /S/a@nkara-bhashya further is the authority most generally deferred to  in India as to the right understanding of the Vedanta-sutras, and ever  since /S/a@nkara's time the majority of the best thinkers of India have  been men belonging to his school. If in addition to all this we take  into consideration the intrinsic merits of /S/a@nkara's work which, as a  piece of philosophical argumentation and theological apologetics,  undoubtedly occupies a high rank, the preference here given to it will  be easily understood.    But to the European--or, generally, modern--translator of the  Vedanta-sutras with /S/a@nkara's commentary another question will of  course suggest itself at once, viz. whether or not /S/a@nkara's  explanations faithfully render the intended meaning of the author of the  Sutras. To the Indian Pandit of /S/a@nkara's school this question has  become an indifferent one, or, to state the case more accurately, he  objects to it being raised, as he looks on /S/a@nkara's authority as  standing above doubt and dispute. When pressed to make good his position  he will, moreover, most probably not enter into any detailed comparison  of /S/a@nkara's comments with the text of Badaraya/n/a's Sutras, but  will rather endeavour to show on speculative grounds that /S/a@nkara's  philosophical view is the only true one, whence it of course follows  that it accurately represents the meaning of Badaraya/n/a, who himself  must necessarily be assured to have taught the true doctrine. But on the  modern investigator, who neither can consider himself bound by the  authority of a name however great, nor is likely to look to any Indian  system of thought for the satisfaction of his speculative wants, it is  clearly incumbent not to acquiesce from the outset in the  interpretations given of the Vedanta-sutras--and the Upanishads--by  /S/a@nkara and his school, but to submit them, as far as that can be  done, to a critical investigation.    This is a task which would have to be undertaken even if /S/a@nkara's  views as to the true meaning of the Sutras and Upanishads had never been  called into doubt on Indian soil, although in that case it could perhaps  hardly be entered upon with much hope of success; but it becomes much  more urgent, and at the same time more feasible, when we meet in India  itself with systems claiming to be Vedantic and based on interpretations  of the Sutras and Upanishads more or less differing from those of  /S/a@nkara. The claims of those systems to be in the possession of the  right understanding of the fundamental authorities of the Vedanta must  at any rate be examined, even if we should finally be compelled to  reject them.    It appears that already at a very early period the Vedanta-sutras had  come to be looked upon as an authoritative work, not to be neglected by  any who wished to affiliate their own doctrines to the Veda. At present,  at any rate, there are very few Hindu sects not interested in showing  that their distinctive tenets are countenanced by Badaraya/n/a's  teaching. Owing to this the commentaries on the Sutras have in the  course of time become very numerous, and it is at present impossible to  give a full and accurate enumeration even of those actually existing,  much less of those referred to and quoted. Mr. Fitz-Edward Hall, in his  Bibliographical Index, mentions fourteen commentaries, copies of which  had been inspected by himself. Some among these (as, for instance,  Ramanuja's Vedanta-sara, No. XXXV) are indeed not commentaries in the  strict sense of the word, but rather systematic expositions of the  doctrine supposed to be propounded in the Sutras; but, on the other  hand, there are in existence several true commentaries which had not  been accessible to Fitz-Edward Hall. It would hardly be practical--and  certainly not feasible in this place--to submit all the existing  bhashyas to a critical enquiry at once. All we can do here is to single  out one or a few of the more important ones, and to compare their  interpretations with those given by /S/a@nkara, and with the text of the  Sutras themselves.    The bhashya, which in this connexion is the first to press itself upon  our attention, is the one composed by the famous Vaish@nava theologian  and philosopher Ramanuja, who is supposed to have lived in the twelfth  century. The Ramanuja or, as it is often called, the /S/ri-bhashya  appears to be the oldest commentary extant next to /S/a@nkara's. It is  further to be noted that the sect of the Ramanujas occupies a  pre-eminent position among the Vaishnava, sects which themselves, in  their totality, may claim to be considered the most important among all  Hindu sects. The intrinsic value of the /S/ri-bhashya moreover is--as  every student acquainted with it will be ready to acknowledge--a very  high one; it strikes one throughout as a very solid performance due to a  writer of extensive learning and great power of argumentation, and in  its polemic parts, directed chiefly against the school of /S/a@nkara, it  not unfrequently deserves to be called brilliant even. And in addition  to all this it shows evident traces of being not the mere outcome of  Ramanuja's individual views, but of resting on an old and weighty  tradition.    This latter point is clearly of the greatest importance. If it could be  demonstrated or even rendered probable only that the oldest bhashya  which we possess, i.e. the /S/a@nkara-bhashya, represents an  uninterrupted and uniform tradition bridging over the interval between  Badaraya/n/a, the reputed author of the Sutras, and /S/a@nkara; and if,  on the other hand, it could be shown that the more modern bhashyas are  not supported by old tradition, but are nothing more than bold attempts  of clever sectarians to force an old work of generally recognised  authority into the service of their individual tenets; there would  certainly be no reason for us to raise the question whether the later  bhashyas can help us in making out the true meaning of the Sutras.
