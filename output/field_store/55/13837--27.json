He stands as the  prototype of the great class of resurrection-gods who die that they may  live again. His sufferings, his death, and his resurrection were enacted  year by year in a great mystery-play at Abydos. In that mystery-play was  set forth, first, what the Greeks call his _agon_, his contest with his  enemy Set; then his _pathos_, his suffering, or downfall and defeat, his  wounding, his death, and his burial; finally, his resurrection and  \"recognition,\" his _anagnorisis_ either as himself or as his only  begotten son Horus. Now the meaning of this thrice-told tale we shall  consider later: for the moment we are concerned only with the fact that  it is set forth both in art and ritual.    At the festival of Osiris small images of the god were made of sand and  vegetable earth, his cheek bones were painted green and his face yellow.  The images were cast in a mould of pure gold, representing the god as a  mummy. After sunset on the 24th day of the month Choiak, the effigy of  Osiris was laid in a grave and the image of the previous year was  removed. The intent of all this was made transparently clear by other  rites. At the beginning of the festival there was a ceremony of  ploughing and sowing. One end of the field was sown with barley, the  other with spelt; another part with flax. While this was going on the  chief priest recited the ritual of the \"sowing of the fields.\" Into the  \"garden\" of the god, which seems to have been a large pot, were put sand  and barley, then fresh living water from the inundation of the Nile was  poured out of a golden vase over the \"garden\" and the barley was allowed  to grow up. It was the symbol of the resurrection of the god after his  burial, \"for the growth of the garden is the growth of the divine  substance.\"    The death and resurrection of the gods, and _pari passu_ of the life and  fruits of the earth, was thus set forth in ritual, but--and this is our  immediate point--it was also set forth in definite, unmistakable art. In  the great temple of Isis at Philae there is a chamber dedicated to  Osiris. Here is represented the dead Osiris. Out of his body spring ears  of corn, and a priest waters the growing stalk from a pitcher. The  inscription to the picture reads: _This is the form of him whom one may  not name, Osiris of the mysteries, who springs from the returning  waters._ It is but another presentation of the ritual of the month  Choiak, in which effigies of the god made of earth and corn were buried.  When these effigies were taken up it would be found that the corn had  sprouted actually from the body of the god, and this sprouting of the  grain would, as Dr. Frazer says, be \"hailed as an omen, or rather as the  cause of the growth of the crops.\"[1]    Even more vividly is the resurrection set forth in the bas-reliefs that  accompany the great Osiris inscription at Denderah. Here the god is  represented at first as a mummy swathed and lying flat on his bier. Bit  by bit he is seen raising himself up in a series of gymnastically  impossible positions, till at last he rises from a bowl--perhaps his  \"garden\"--all but erect, between the outspread wings of Isis, while  before him a male figure holds the _crux ansata_, the \"cross with a  handle,\" the Egyptian symbol of life. In ritual, the thing desired,  _i.e._ the resurrection, is acted, in art it is represented.    No one will refuse to these bas-reliefs the title of art. In Egypt,  then, we have clearly an instance--only one out of many--where art and  ritual go hand in hand. Countless bas-reliefs that decorate Egyptian  tombs and temples are but ritual practices translated into stone. This,  as we shall later see, is an important step in our argument. Ancient art  and ritual are not only closely connected, not only do they mutually  explain and illustrate each other, but, as we shall presently find, they  actually arise out of a common human impulse.           *       *       *       *       *    The god who died and rose again is not of course confined to Egypt; he  is world-wide. When Ezekiel (viii. 14) \"came to the gate of the Lord's  house which was toward the north\" he beheld there the \"women weeping for  Tammuz.\" This \"abomination\" the house of Judah had brought with them  from Babylon. Tammuz is _Dumuzi_, \"the true son,\" or more fully,  _Dumuzi-absu_, \"true son of the waters.\" He too, like Osiris, is a god  of the life that springs from inundation and that dies down in the heat  of the summer. In Milton's procession of false gods,              \"Thammuz came next behind,      Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured      The Syrian damsels to lament his fate      In amorous ditties all a summer's day.\"    Tammuz in Babylon was the young love of Ishtar. Each year he died and  passed below the earth to the place of dust and death, \"the land from  which there is no returning, the house of darkness, where dust lies on  door and bolt.\" And the goddess went after him, and while she was below,  life ceased in the earth, no flower blossomed and no child of animal or  man was born.    We know Tammuz, \"the true son,\" best by one of his titles, Adonis, the  Lord or King. The Rites of Adonis were celebrated at midsummer. That is  certain and memorable; for, just as the Athenian fleet was setting sail  on its ill-omened voyage to Syracuse, the streets of Athens were  thronged with funeral processions, everywhere was seen the image of the  dead god, and the air was full of the lamentations of weeping women.  Thucydides does not so much as mention the coincidence, but Plutarch[2]  tells us those who took account of omens were full of concern for the  fate of their countrymen. To start an expedition on the day of the  funeral rites of Adonis, the Canaanitish \"Lord,\" was no luckier than to  set sail on a Friday, the death-day of the \"Lord\" of Christendom.    The rites of Tammuz and of Adonis, celebrated in the summer, were rites  of death rather than of resurrection. The emphasis is on the fading and  dying down of vegetation rather than on its upspringing. The reason of  this is simple and will soon become manifest. For the moment we have  only to note that while in Egypt the rites of Osiris are represented as  much by art as by ritual, in Babylon and Palestine in the feasts of  Tammuz and Adonis it is ritual rather than art that obtains.           *       *       *       *       *    We have now to pass to another enquiry. We have seen that art and  ritual, not only in Greece but in Egypt and Palestine, are closely  linked. So closely, indeed, are they linked that we even begin to  suspect they may have a common origin. We have now to ask, what is it  that links art and ritual so closely together, what have they in common?  Do they start from the same impulse, and if so why do they, as they  develop, fall so widely asunder?    It will clear the air if we consider for a moment what we mean by art,  and also in somewhat greater detail what we mean by ritual.           *       *       *       *       *    Art, Plato[3] tells us in a famous passage of the _Republic_, is  imitation; the artist imitates natural objects, which are themselves in  his philosophy but copies of higher realities. All the artist can do is  to make a copy of a copy, to hold up a mirror to Nature in which, as he  turns it whither he will, \"are reflected sun and heavens and earth and  man,\" anything and everything. Never did a statement so false, so  wrong-headed, contain so much suggestion of truth--truth which, by the  help of analysing ritual, we may perhaps be able to disentangle. But  first its falsehood must be grasped, and this is the more important as  Plato's misconception in modified form lives on to-day. A painter not  long ago thus defined his own art: \"The art of painting is the art of  imitating solid objects upon a flat surface by means of pigments.\" A  sorry life-work! Few people to-day, perhaps, regard art as the close and  realistic copy of Nature; photography has at least scotched, if not  slain, that error; but many people still regard art as a sort of  improvement on or an \"idealization\" of Nature. It is the part of the  artist, they think, to take suggestions and materials from Nature, and  from these to build up, as it were, a revised version. It is, perhaps,  only by studying those rudimentary forms of art that are closely akin to  ritual that we come to see how utterly wrong-headed is this conception.    Take the representations of Osiris that we have just described--the  mummy rising bit by bit from his bier. Can any one maintain that art is  here a copy or imitation of reality? However \"realistic\" the painting,  it represents a thing imagined not actual. There never was any such  person as Osiris, and if there had been, he would certainly never, once  mummified, have risen from his tomb. There is no question of fact, and  the copy of fact, in the matter. Moreover, had there been, why should  anyone desire to make a copy of natural fact? The whole \"imitation\"  theory, to which, and to the element of truth it contains, we shall  later have occasion to return, errs, in fact, through supplying no  adequate motive for a widespread human energy. It is probably this lack  of motive that has led other theorizers to adopt the view that art is  idealization. Man with pardonable optimism desires, it is thought, to  improve on Nature.           *       *       *       *       *    Modern science, confronted with a problem like that of the rise of art,  no longer casts about to conjecture how art _might_ have arisen, she  examines how it actually _did_ arise.
