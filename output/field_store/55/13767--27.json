The lessons to be learnt from Cromwell's campaigns have been thus  epitomized by General Baden-Powell:--\"There is one thing that ought not  to escape the attention of students, namely the success that attended  Cromwell's method of rallying his troops whenever they got dispersed.  When things looked bad, as they did on one or two occasions, when some  of his cavalry were defeated and the rest scattered, he never lost heart  and his men never lost heart; they knew they had to rally again and  attack somewhere else. Very often the enemy were deceived by that,  thinking that the Roundheads were scattered and broken up, and took no  further notice of him until they suddenly found him attacking from quite  a new direction. That was the secret of his success on many occasions,  and one that has its lesson to-day, just as it had in those days--that  when all seems pretty bad and you are scattered and broken, keep up a  good heart and get together again and have another go.\" With scarcely  the change of a word these remarks will account for the prolongation of  the war for two years after the occupation of the Boer capitals.    The Boer leaders, like their great prototype Cromwell, owed much of  their success to their novel and skilful use of mounted troops. The  European conception of the functions of mounted troops had been  stereotyped for some time; Cavalry screens an advancing army, prevents  the enemy observing its dispositions, acts as its eyes and ears; and so  forth. It is true that Great Britain had already for at least a  generation employed Mounted Infantry in colonial wars; but the  innovation had never been approved of on the Continent, where it was  regarded as a cheap and inefficient British substitute for Cavalry.    Yet the famous postscript \"unmounted men preferred,\"[2] which was  affixed to the acceptance of the help proffered by the Australian  Colonies, shows that at first the power of mounted troops acting not as  the eyes and ears of an army, but as a mobile and supple \"mailed fist,\"  was not understood. In ten weeks, however, the tune changed, and it was  \"preference given to mounted contingents.\"    When the grand operations were over, the enemy's chief towns occupied,  and the lines of communication fairly secure, the necessity for mounted  troops became still more apparent. The Boers saw that it was useless for  them to campaign at large. They took to _guerilla_, and restricted  themselves generally to independent horse raids against which foot  troops were powerless. Gradually the proportion of horses to men in the  British columns rose, until practically all the combatants were mounted,  and at last the Cromwellian principle that the best military weapon is a  man on a horse was fully accepted.    The military qualities of the Boers, like those of Cromwell's men, were  useful but not showy. They came by instinct and not by acquisition, and  they cannot be sufficiently accounted for as the outcome of experience  in the pursuit of game on the veld. They were neutralized partially by  characteristics the reverse of military. The Boers were not remarkable  for personal courage. If there had been in the Boer Army a decoration  corresponding to the Victoria Cross it would have been rarely won or at  least rarely earned. There is scarcely an instance of an individual feat  of arms or act of devotion performed by a Burgher. On the few occasions  when the Boers were charged by cavalry they became paralysed with  terror. They were incapable of submitting themselves to discipline, and  difficult to command in large numbers. They could not be made to  understand that prompt action, which possibly might not be the best  under the circumstances, was preferable to wasting time in discussing a  better with the field cornets. They were subject to panics and, for the  time, easily disheartened: and their sense of duty was not conspicuous.  The principles of strategy were unknown to them, their tactics were  crude, and with the exception of a very few who had fought in 1881, they  were without experience of the realities of war.[3]    If in the month of September, 1899, an impartial military critic in a  foreign Ministry of War had been directed to draw up an appreciation of  the situation and to forecast the course of the impending struggle, he  would probably have expressed himself somewhat as follows:--    \"An Army of 100,000 men is the utmost that Great Britain will be able to  place in the field in South Africa, for the Indian and Colonial drafts  must be provided for, and the Militia and other Auxiliary Forces, which  are not of much account, are tethered to the country; but it will be  sufficient for the purpose. Although the military system of Great  Britain is hopelessly behind the times, she has always done wonders with  her boomerangs, bows and arrows, and flint instruments. That Army will  be fairly well furnished with modern weapons and equipment, and the  excellent personality of the soldier will compensate to a great extent  for incapacity in the Staff and superior officers. With this Army she  will have to meet a brave but undisciplined opponent whose numbers  cannot be estimated. Even if the Free Staters are included it is  improbable that more than 100,000 men can be put into the field. These  have had no military training, their leaders will be unprofessional  officers who will be unable to make good use of the munitions of War  which the two Republics have been strangely allowed to import through  British ports and to accumulate in large quantities. If the burghers of  the Orange Free State throw in their lot with the Transvaalers, which is  improbable as they have no quarrel with Great Britain, the numbers  opposed to her will certainly be augmented, but the task before her will  be greatly simplified. Instead of having to send one portion of her Army  by way of Natal to effect a junction in the Transvaal, with the other  portion working northwards through Kimberley and Mafeking, a campaign  which would involve two long and vulnerable lines of communication, she  will be able to strike at once through the heart of the Free State and  will advance without much difficulty to Johannesburg and Pretoria. The  hardest part of her task will be the passage of the Vaal, where a great  battle will be fought, and the capture of Pretoria, which is reported to  be well fortified. With Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, Pretoria and the  railways in the possession of Great Britain, the opposition will  collapse in a very few weeks, for no nation has ever been able to carry  on a struggle when its chief towns and means of communication are in the  enemy's possession.\"    This hypothetical appreciation probably represents the general opinion  current both at home and abroad during the period immediately preceding  the outbreak of the War; but it proved to be mistaken from the first.  The Free Staters joined the Transvaalers and the allied forces assumed  the offensive over a wide area without delay. Kimberley and Mafeking  were threatened on the west, and on the east the Boers poured into  Natal, upon which they had for sixty years looked with the aggrieved and  greedy eyes of a dog from whom a bone, to which he believes he is  entitled, has been recovered.    To Natal, in 1824, had come a handful of British pioneers. From Chaka,  the King of the Zulus, they obtained a grant of land upon the coast, and  after eleven years they endeavoured without success to induce the  British Government to recognize the settlement, which in course of time  became the City of Durban, as a Colony to which, in honour of the  Princess heiress presumptive to the Throne of Great Britain, they  proposed to give the name Victoria; and they were thus the first to  associate her with the Empire, which, in spite of reluctant politicians  who did their best to restrict it, was destined to expand marvellously  during her reign.    The Natal settlement was frowned on by the Imperial Government, who even  confiscated a little ship which the pioneers had toilfully fitted out  and which was bringing envoys from the King of the Zulus to the King of  England, on the plea that it was unregistered and that it came from a  foreign port. In 1828 Chaka, who was not unfavourably disposed towards  the Durban pioneers, was murdered by his brother Dingaan, who succeeded  him as King of the Zulus. It is said that his last words to Dingaan  were, \"You think that you will rule the land when I am gone, but I see  the white men coming, and they will be your masters.\"    His words were prophetically true, but there were two races of white men  hovering over Natal; and the Great King of the Zulus, a tribe held in  little account before his time, but which had under his leadership  absorbed or exterminated almost every other tribe from Pondoland to  Delagoa Bay, was no longer with them to choose between the rivals to his  own ends and advantage; and Dingaan inherited the cruelty without the  ability or the statecraft of his brother, the Napoleon of South Africa.    Of all the races of Europe the Low Germans of Holland seemed the least  likely to contract the migratory habit. The Hollander of the present  day, popularly but incorrectly called a Dutchman, is home-staying and  home-loving. The compact, well-cared-for, well-ordered homestead,  village, and town communities of the Netherlands are inconsistent with a  roving disposition, and yet the Hollanders of South Africa furnished the  most conspicuous example of Nomadism in modern times.    It may have been that the ordeal of Alva and the subsequent disturbance  of the Thirty Years' War had constitutionally unsettled the Hollanders  to such a degree that their descendants, emancipated from European  ideas, became prone to restlessness, for "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/157"],[0,"Daddy-Long-Legs (#2)"],[1," paid directly to the college, and you will receive  in addition during the four years you are there, an allowance of  thirty-five dollars a month.  This will enable you to enter on the same  standing as the other students.  The money will be sent to you by the  gentleman's private secretary once a month, and in return, you will  write a letter of acknowledgment once a month.  That is--you are not to  thank him for the money; he doesn't care to have that mentioned, but  you are to write a letter telling of the progress in your studies and  the details of your daily life.  Just such a letter as you would write  to your parents if they were living.    'These letters will be addressed to Mr. John Smith and will be sent in  care of the secretary.  The gentleman's name is not John Smith, but he  prefers to remain unknown.  To you he will never be anything but John  Smith.  His reason in requiring the letters is that he thinks nothing  so fosters facility in literary expression as letter-writing. Since you  have no family with whom to correspond, he desires you to write in this  way; also, he wishes to keep track of your progress.  He will never  answer your letters, nor in the slightest particular take any notice of  them.  He detests letter-writing and does not wish you to become a  burden.  If any point should ever arise where an answer would seem to  be imperative--such as in the event of your being expelled, which I  trust will not occur--you may correspond with Mr. Griggs, his  secretary.  These monthly letters are absolutely obligatory on your  part; they are the only payment that Mr. Smith requires, so you must be  as punctilious in sending them as though it were a bill that you were  paying.  I hope that they will always be respectful in tone and will  reflect credit on your training.  You must remember that you are  writing to a Trustee of the John Grier Home.'    Jerusha's eyes longingly sought the door.  Her head was in a whirl of  excitement, and she wished only to escape from Mrs. Lippett's  platitudes and think.  She rose and took a tentative step backwards.  Mrs. Lippett detained her with a gesture; it was an oratorical  opportunity not to be slighted.    'I trust that you are properly grateful for this very rare good fortune  that has befallen you?  Not many girls in your position ever have such  an opportunity to rise in the world.  You must always remember--'    'I--yes, ma'am, thank you.  I think, if that's all, I must go and sew a  patch on Freddie Perkins's trousers.'    The door closed behind her, and Mrs. Lippett watched it with dropped  jaw, her peroration in mid-air.          The Letters of    Miss Jerusha Abbott    to    Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith                                         215 FERGUSSEN HALL                                             24th September    Dear Kind-Trustee-Who-Sends-Orphans-to-College,    Here I am!  I travelled yesterday for four hours in a train.  It's a  funny sensation, isn't it?  I never rode in one before.    College is the biggest, most bewildering place--I get lost whenever I  leave my room.  I will write you a description later when I'm feeling  less muddled; also I will tell you about my lessons.  Classes don't  begin until Monday morning, and this is Saturday night.  But I wanted  to write a letter first just to get acquainted.    It seems queer to be writing letters to somebody you don't know.  It  seems queer for me to be writing letters at all--I've never written  more than three or four in my life, so please overlook it if these are  not a model kind.    Before leaving yesterday morning, Mrs. Lippett and I had a very serious  talk.  She told me how to behave all the rest of my life, and  especially how to behave towards the kind gentleman who is doing so  much for me.  I must take care to be Very Respectful.    But how can one be very respectful to a person who wishes to be called  John Smith?  Why couldn't you have picked out a name with a little  personality?  I might as well write letters to Dear Hitching-Post or  Dear Clothes-Prop.    I have been thinking about you a great deal this summer; having  somebody take an interest in me after all these years makes me feel as  though I had found a sort of family.  It seems as though I belonged to  somebody now, and it's a very comfortable sensation.  I must say,  however, that when I think about you, my imagination has very little to  work upon.  There are just three things that I know:    I. You are tall.    II.  You are rich.    III.  You hate girls.    I suppose I might call you Dear Mr. Girl-Hater. Only that's rather  insulting to me.  Or Dear Mr. Rich-Man, but that's insulting to you, as  though money were the only important thing about you.  Besides, being  rich is such a very external quality.  Maybe you won't stay rich all  your life; lots of very clever men get smashed up in Wall Street.  But  at least you will stay tall all your life!  So I've decided to call you  Dear Daddy-Long-Legs. I hope you won't mind.  It's just a private pet  name we won't tell Mrs. Lippett.    The ten o'clock bell is going to ring in two minutes.  Our day is  divided into sections by bells.  We eat and sleep and study by bells.  It's very enlivening; I feel like a fire horse all of the time.  There  it goes!  Lights out.  Good night.    Observe with what precision I obey rules--due to my training in the  John Grier Home.               Yours most respectfully,                                         Jerusha Abbott          To Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith                                               1st October    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    I love college and I love you for sending me--I'm very, very happy, and  so excited every moment of the time that I can scarcely sleep.  You  can't imagine how different it is from the John Grier Home.  I never  dreamed there was such a place in the world.  I'm feeling sorry for  everybody who isn't a girl and who can't come here; I am sure the  college you attended when you were a boy couldn't have been so nice.    My room is up in a tower that used to be the contagious ward before  they built the new infirmary.  There are three other girls on the same  floor of the tower--a Senior who wears spectacles and is always asking  us please to be a little more quiet, and two Freshmen named Sallie  McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton.  Sallie has red hair and a  turn-up nose and is quite friendly; Julia comes from one of the first  families in New York and hasn't noticed me yet.  They room together and  the Senior and I have singles.  Usually Freshmen can't get singles;  they are very scarce, but I got one without even asking.  I suppose the  registrar didn't think it would be right to ask a properly brought-up  girl to room with a foundling.  You see there are advantages!    My room is on the north-west corner with two windows and a view.  After  you've lived in a ward for eighteen years with twenty room-mates, it is  restful to be alone.  This is the first chance I've ever had to get  acquainted with Jerusha Abbott.  I think I'm going to like her.    Do you think you are?                                                 Tuesday    They are organizing the Freshman basket-ball team and there's just a  chance that I shall get in it.  I'm little of course, but terribly  quick and wiry and tough.  While the others are hopping about in the  air, I can dodge under their feet and grab the ball.  It's loads of fun  practising--out in the athletic field in the afternoon with the trees  all red and yellow and the air full of the smell of burning leaves, and  everybody laughing and shouting.  These are the happiest girls I ever  saw--and I am the happiest of all!    I meant to write a long letter and tell you all the things I'm learning  (Mrs. Lippett said you wanted to know), but 7th hour has just rung, and  in ten minutes I'm due at the athletic field in gymnasium clothes.  Don't you hope I'll get in the team?                                   Yours always,                                             Jerusha Abbott    PS. (9 o'clock.)    Sallie McBride just poked her head in at my door.  This is what she  said:    'I'm so homesick that I simply can't stand it.  Do you feel that way?'    I smiled a little and said no; I thought I could pull through.  At  least homesickness is one disease that I've escaped!  I never heard of  anybody being asylum-sick, did you?                                                         10th October    Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,    Did you ever hear of Michael Angelo?    He was a famous artist who lived in Italy in the Middle Ages.  Everybody in English Literature seemed to know about him, and the whole  class laughed because I thought he was an archangel.  He sounds like an  archangel, doesn't he?  The trouble with college is that you are  expected to know such a lot of things you've never learned.  It's very  embarrassing at times.  But now, when the girls talk about things that  I never heard of, I just keep still and look them up in the  encyclopedia.    I made an awful mistake the first day.  Somebody mentioned Maurice  Maeterlinck, and I asked if she was a Freshman.  That joke has gone all  over college.  But anyway, I'm just as bright in class as any of the  others--and brighter than some of them!    Do you care to know how I've furnished my room?  It's a symphony in  brown and yellow.  The wall was tinted buff, and I've bought yellow  denim curtains and cushions and a mahogany desk (second hand for three  dollars) and a rattan chair and a brown rug with an ink spot in the  middle.  I stand the chair over the spot.    The windows are up high; you can't look out from an ordinary seat.  But  I unscrewed the looking-glass from the back of the bureau, upholstered  the top and moved it up against the window.  It's just the right height  for a window seat.  You pull out the drawers like steps and walk up.  Very comfortable!    Sallie McBride helped me choose the things at the "]]]
