The fact that a building of  such great beauty should adorn a city so situated is remarkable; for  long after--as we read in Macaulay--weekly posts left London for various  parts of England, Exeter was still, as it were, on the borders of  territories scarcely explored, and was the furthest western point to  which letters were conveyed from the metropolis. Fuller thus describes  the county of Devonshire in his day (1646): \"Devonshire hath the narrow  seas on the South, the Severn on the North, Cornwall on the West, Dorset  and Somersetshire on the East. A goodly province, the second in England  for greatness, clear in view without measuring, as bearing a square of  fifty miles. Some part thereof, as the South Hams, is so fruitful it  needs no art; but generally (though not running of itself) it answers to  the spur of industry. No shire showes more industrious, or so many  Husbandmen, who by Marle (blew and white), Chalk, Lime, Seasand,  Compost, Sopeashes, Rags and what not, make the ground both to take and  keep a moderate fruitfulness; so that Virgil, if now alive, might make  additions to his Georgicks, from the Plough-practice in this county. As  for the natives thereof, generally they are dexterous in any employment,  and Queen Elizabeth was wont to say of the gentry: _They were all born  courtiers with a becomming confidence_.\"    The city of Exeter is of great age. \"Isca Damnoniorum, Caer Wise,  Exanceaster, Exeter, keeping essentially the same name under all  changes, stands distinguished as the one great city which has, in a more  marked way than any other, kept its unbroken being and its unbroken  position throughout all ages.\" But though Whitaker asserts that in the  middle of the fifth century it was the seat of a bishop, Professor  Freeman, with more authority, declares that the city did not become a  bishop's see till the latter half of the eleventh century, at which  period the bishopstools were removed from the small to the great towns.  Until 703 A.D. Devonshire formed part of the vast diocese of Wessex.  About the year 900 A.D. the diocese of Devon and Cornwall was divided  into two--the former with its bishop's seat at Crediton--only to be  reunited again a hundred and fifty years later when Leofric was  appointed bishop.    The first record of a church dedicated to SS. Mary and Peter in Exeter,  is that of an abbey church founded by Athelstan. But Sweyn destroyed it  seventy years later, and it seems frequently to have been attacked by  invaders previous to its destruction. But in 1019 Canute endowed a new  church and confirmed by charter their lands and privileges to the monks.  This building must have been of some pretensions, for it was given to  Leofric for his cathedral church in 1050. It occupied the site of the  present Lady Chapel. When Warelwast and Marshall built their Norman  church they placed it on the east of the old church, leaving an  intervening space. Their nave occupied the site of the present nave, the  transeptal towers were the same, but the choir was shorter and probably  terminated in an apse flanked by smaller apses at the ends of the choir  aisles. Traces of one of these have been found at the end of the third  bay of the north choir aisle. Bronscombe and Quivil (see p. 5) began  their reconstruction at this end, and by adding the ambulatory and Lady  Chapel linked together the sites of the old and new churches.    With the episcopate of Leofric, Exeter first assumes the rank of a  cathedral city. The sees of Devon and Cornwall had been held together by  Lyfing, the last bishop of Crediton. But Crediton, an unfortified  \"vill,\" was an easy prey to the Irish, Danes, and other pirates, who  devastated the diocese from time to time. Leofric felt the urgent  necessity for a change, and fixed on the walled town of Exeter to be his  cathedral city. He sent a clerk to the pope asking him to write to the  king recommending the change. The king readily consented, and the church  of St. Mary and St. Peter was given to the bishop as his cathedral  church. The event was clearly regarded as of considerable importance,  for at his installation Edward the Confessor \"supported his right arm  and Queen Eadgytha his left.\" Archbishops, bishops, and nobles also  assisted at the ceremony. Leofric proved a hard-working and wise  prelate, and gave generously of lands and moneys to his church. He had  found it but poorly furnished, the wardrobe only containing \"one  worthless priest's dress.\" He also remembered it in his will, and the  great \"Liber Exoniensis\" was his gift.    But if the history of the see has its birth with Leofric, the story of  the cathedral begins with the appointment in 1107 of Warelwast as  bishop. This noteworthy man was a nephew of the Conqueror and chaplain  to both William II and Henry I. Inheriting to the full the Norman  passion for building, he pulled down the Saxon edifice and began to  erect a great Norman cathedral in its stead. The transeptal towers  attest the magnificence of his scheme. There is nothing quite like them  anywhere else, though at Barcelona and Chalons-sur-Marne may be seen  something similar. But they suffice to stamp him as an architect of  exceptional genius. He laboured zealously in other matters, founding at  Plympton a wealthy Augustinian priory; he also represented the king at  Rome in his famous quarrel with Anselm. It is said that he became blind  and died, an old man, at his priory of Plympton.    The next important date to notice is 1194, when Henry Marshall, brother  of Walter Earl Marshall, was made bishop. For two years the episcopal  throne had remained empty, the king being absent from England in the  Holy Land. But with the appointment of Marshall a most important stage  is reached. King John gave to the see the tithes of the tin in  Devonshire and Cornwall. This must have largely increased the episcopal  income, for Marshall quickly set about completing the work Warelwast had  begun a hundred years before. To this end he granted the emoluments of  St. Erth's Church, near Hayle, Cornwall, to be used towards defraying  the cost of repairs. He also called upon each householder to show his  interest in the work by subscribing, at Pentecost, an alms of \"unum  obolum ad minim.\" For the sufficient remuneration of the choral vicars  he made over to them the church of St. Swithun in Woodbury, \"with all  its appurtenances.\"    To Marshall we owe extensive additions to the nave, the north porch, and  the cloister doorway. He completed the Norman church begun by Warelwast,  but there is no evidence that he extended to the eastward, as is  sometimes stated. The position of the tomb in the \"founder's place\" on  the north side of the choir indicates that it terminated only a few  yards farther to the east. Beyond there must have been an open space  between the Norman and the old Saxon cathedrals.    For nearly fifty years there are but scant records of work done to the  building. Though Professor Freeman[1] speaks of its \"not long-lived  perfection,\" it is quite possible that Marshall's work was considered,  by his own and the succeeding generation, to be final. Any interest  there may be in the lives of two of the succeeding bishops, until the  election of Bronscombe in 1257, is for the most part due to their  labours in other matters. For example, under Simon de Apulia, the city  of Exeter was divided into parishes; and by William Bruere the chapter  house and stalls of the old choir were completed. He was one of the  leaders of the English army at Acre in 1228. He also created the deanery  of Exeter.        [1] \"Exeter\" (Historic Towns Series), by Prof. E.A. Freeman      (Longmans).    But with the arrival of Walter Bronscombe a new career of architectural  energy begins. Now dawns that wonderful transformation period, at the  close of which the church stood pretty much as we now know it.  Concerning Bronscombe's character there has been somewhat bitter  dispute. It is certain that he was accused of craftiness and meanness.  But William of Worcester, whose testimony is valuable, called him Walter  le Good. Whatever may be the real truth of the matter, he seems to have  made an admirable bishop, his election reflecting considerable credit on  the acumen of those concerned in it. For he had not, surely, much to  recommend him, at first sight, for so important a position. Though he  was Archdeacon of Surrey at the time of his appointment, he was not a  priest, and he was quite a young man. He was a vigorous supporter of  learning throughout the diocese, probably because of his anxiety to give  other men of humble origin a fair chance of making their way in the  world. He restored the College of Crediton, and built one at Glaseney.  Bronscombe may be credited with giving the first impetus to the  reconstruction of the cathedral by his work in the Lady Chapel and the  chapels on either side of it, viz., that of St. Mary Magdalen on the  north, and St. Gabriel on the south, the latter being destined for his  own tomb. To his Dean and Chapter he appropriated the church of St.  Bruared in Cornwall, that the feast of his patron saint, Gabriel, might  be worthily maintained.    Peter Quivil, his successor in the see, was probably working with him,  as he was a canon of the cathedral before being raised to the bishopric.  He invented and designed the Decorated cathedral, and transformed the  transepts. He must be classed with Warelwast as the chief of the  building bishops. Admirably and sympathetically as his work was  continued by those who followed him, their claim on our recognition and  gratitude is less. His skill, too, seems to have been almost equalled by  his generosity, for out of gratitude the Chapter promised to maintain  his yearly obit.

The chief part of the  collection of casts of architectural sculpture and detail belonging to  the department has been deposited in the Museum of Fine Arts, together  with the architectural collection belonging to the museum. The students  of the Department have free access to the museum at all times; as the  building is close at hand no inconvenience results from the change, and  some of the advanced exercises in drawing are held there. The museum of  sanitary and building appliances contains models of plumbing apparatus,  specimens of metal work, tile work, glass work, and wood work, partly  purchased, but mostly deposited with the Department by the  manufacturers. The architectural library contains a large and carefully  selected collection of technical works and the leading periodicals, both  American and foreign. The resources of the Department have been much  enlarged by the erection of a special building devoted entirely to its  uses.    In 1894 a summer school of architecture was held in Salem and Portsmouth  for the study of colonial work. The courtesy of owners of houses built  at this epoch allowed the students to measure and sketch the best work  of this interesting locality, and in the future it is proposed to make  an exhaustive study of colonial architecture.    Both men and women are admitted to all departments of the Institute.  Candidates for admission must be at least seventeen years of age, and  must pass satisfactory examinations in algebra, plane geometry, either  French or German, English, history, and either advanced algebra or solid  geometry. A detailed account of these requirements and the general  conditions of the entrance examinations, which are held the last of June  and middle of September, can be found in the catalogue of the Institute,  which will be sent upon application by the secretary. The tuition fee is  $200.00 a year divided into two payments, $125.00 due in October and  $75.00 due in January.    During a number of years a special course of two years was maintained in  the school, which attracted many students who did not find it possible  to spend the time required for the full course of four years. This  arrangement has now been discontinued and no special provision is at  present made for other than regular students.    The Institute has from the beginning modeled its instruction very  largely upon that of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and has ranked until the  last few years as the only American school in which a thorough academic  training in architectural design was attempted. Its professors of design  Professor E. Letang, who died in 1892, and Professor D. Despradelle,  both Frenchmen, have devoted their whole time to this branch of  instruction, and have maintained a standard which until recently other  schools have not approached.    Although the graduates from the full four years' course are  comparatively few, no other school can count so many of its former  students in prominent positions in the profession, and the Institute is  deservedly proud of its record in this direction.

J.  Van Pelt, J. H. Friedlander, and D. Hale. The first diplomas were  awarded in 1869, before that date there being no official recognition of  the completion of any required course in the school, except the awards  in the various _concours_, all leading up to the Grand Prize of Rome.    There are a number of Americans now in Paris who intend to present  theses for the diploma, and doubtless other awards will follow those  already made. Any present or former student of the school who has  reached the required standard in his work is allowed to submit a thesis  in competition for the diploma.    At the entrance examination of the Ecole this year sixteen American  students of architecture were received. Last year there were but eight,  which up to that time was the largest number recorded.           *       *       *       *       *    The Chicago Architectural Club has given evidence this year of very  great activity, and its work has been directed in many channels and with  good effect. Its lectures, classes, competitions, smokers, Bohemian  nights, receptions, ladies' nights, expeditions to places of interest,  and finally its exhibition of last month have all been excellently  chosen to instruct, interest, and amuse its members, and incidentally  promote the general cause of architectural education. The long list of  attractions has held the interest of its members without flagging. In  the classwork it has had the services and advice of the best and most  competent men connected with the profession; and in all directions it is  to be congratulated upon the good work done.          Books.      _AEsthetic Principles_: By Henry Rutgers Marshall, M. A. Macmillan & Co.  1895. 201 pages. $1.25.    Probably many readers of THE BROCHURE SERIES have struggled as has the  writer (and possibly some are still in an unsettled state of mind in  consequence) over the abstruseness of the current works upon the  philosophy of art, trying to find some obscure foundation on which to  build for themselves a theory of aesthetics. To such, and to all others  who have any wish to reason connectedly on art matters, Mr. Marshall's  little book will be interesting and instructive reading. It is  remarkably clear and understandable even to a reader with no special  training in metaphysical reasoning, and in point of literary style and  carefully considered use of language it is a genuine treat. Its object  is to explain, in as direct and simple language as possible, the nature  and origin of our ideas of the beautiful, and the logical deduction to  be made from the premises, which will guide us in the practice of the  fine arts, or the production of beauty of some special type.    As Mr. Marshall is an architect, many of his illustrative examples are  drawn from architecture, and the book on this account is especially  interesting to architects.           *       *       *       *       *    _Rational Building_: Being a translation of the article \"Construction\"  in the _Dictionnaire Raisonne de l'Architecture Francaise_ of M.  Eugene-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. By George Martin Huss, Architect. New  York: Macmillan & Co. 1895. 367 pages. Illustrated. $3.00.    This book, although confined entirely to the consideration of the French  Gothic, will be found of great value to students. Many of our readers  are of course familiar with it in its original form, while others may  have followed the translation as it has appeared from time to time in  the pages of the _American Architect_.    It will be mainly useful from its historical and theoretical bearing, as  all that is here included which is of practical value for application  to modern uses can be found elsewhere in more available shape. The  illustrations form a most important feature in the usefulness of the  book. The remarkable diagrammatic drawings of Viollet-le-Duc are famous  for their clearness and the amount of information which they convey.    The table of contents includes the following headings: Discussion of  General Conditions and Principles; Roman and Romanesque Vaults; Origin  of the Pointed Arch; Development of Principles; Vaults; Materials;  Thirteenth Century Developments; Civil and Military Construction.           *       *       *       *       *    _Catalogue of the Premiated Drawings of the Department of Architecture,  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1895._ Published by the  Architectural Society. Forty-four illustrations.    The work of the Department of Architecture at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology is without doubt the most fully developed  students' work in architecture now done in this country, and the  drawings shown in this catalogue, giving a selection of the best designs  from the year's work just finished, do credit alike to the system  followed at the school, the fidelity of the instructors, and the  earnestness and talent of the students. The premiated designs in the  competitions of the Society of Beaux-Arts Architects made in the course  of regular school work are reproduced in this catalogue, and also the  first-mentioned designs in the regular monthly problems forming the  drill in design of the school. The program for the latter is given in  each case. These problems make up a graded series of considerable  interest, and are worth careful study and comparison.          Building Exhibit.      The many recent developments in the building arts have rendered it  practically impossible for those not directly connected with them to  keep informed of the latest and most improved methods of construction,  or, in fact, to easily obtain information when desired. To architects,  whose business it is to be familiar with the best and most economical  method of solving any building problem, it is often difficult to find  the information desired, as the field is so wide and the inventions and  improvements multiply so rapidly. To meet the requirements of intending  builders, as well as architects, permanent exhibits of building  materials have been established in several of the principal cities of  the United States, where it is possible to see specimens of the actual  materials, appliances, and latest inventions used in modern  construction. There are such exhibits in Chicago, Philadelphia, New  York, and Brooklyn; and all are proving"]]]
