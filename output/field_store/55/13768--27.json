There are some modern practitioners, who declaim against medical theory in  general, not considering that to think is to theorize; and that no one can  direct a method of cure to a person labouring under disease without  thinking, that is, without theorizing; and happy therefore is the patient,  whose physician possesses the best theory.    The words idea, perception, sensation, recollection, suggestion, and  association, are each of them used in this treatise in a more limited sense  than in the writers of metaphysic. The author was in doubt, whether he  should rather have substituted new words instead of them; but was at length  of opinion, that new definitions of words already in use would be less  burthensome to the memory of the reader.    A great part of this work has lain by the writer above twenty years, as  some of his friends can testify: he had hoped by frequent revision to have  made it more worthy the acceptance of the public; this however his other  perpetual occupations have in part prevented, and may continue to prevent,  as long as he may be capable of revising it; he therefore begs of the  candid reader to accept of it in its present state, and to excuse any  inaccuracies of expression, or of conclusion, into which the intricacy of  his subject, the general imperfection of language, or the frailty he has in  common with other men, may have betrayed him; and from which he has not the  vanity to believe this treatise to be exempt.           *       *       *       *       *    ZOONOMIA.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT. I.    OF MOTION.    The whole of nature may be supposed to consist of two essences or  substances; one of which may be termed spirit, and the other matter. The  former of these possesses the power to commence or produce motion, and the  latter to receive and communicate it. So that motion, considered as a  cause, immediately precedes every effect; and, considered as an effect, it  immediately succeeds every cause.    The MOTIONS OF MATTER may be divided into two kinds, primary and secondary.  The secondary motions are those, which are given to or received from other  matter in motion. Their laws have been successfully investigated by  philosophers in their treatises on mechanic powers. These motions are  distinguished by this circumstance, that the velocity multiplied into the  quantity of matter of the body acted upon is equal to the velocity  multiplied into the quantity of matter of the acting body.    The primary motions of matter may be divided into three classes, those  belonging to gravitation, to chemistry, and to life; and each class has its  peculiar laws. Though these three classes include the motions of solid,  liquid, and aerial bodies; there is nevertheless a fourth division of  motions; I mean those of the supposed ethereal fluids of magnetism,  electricity, heat, and light; whose properties are not so well investigated  as to be classed with sufficient accuracy.    _1st._ The gravitating motions include the annual and diurnal rotation of  the earth and planets, the flux and reflux of the ocean, the descent of  heavy bodies, and other phaenomena of gravitation. The unparalleled sagacity  of the great NEWTON has deduced the laws of this class of motions from the  simple principle of the general attraction of matter. These motions are  distinguished by their tendency to or from the centers of the sun or  planets.    _2d._ The chemical class of motions includes all the various appearances of  chemistry. Many of the facts, which belong to these branches of science,  are nicely ascertained, and elegantly classed; but their laws have not yet  been developed from such simple principles as those above-mentioned; though  it is probable, that they depend on the specific attractions belonging to  the particles of bodies, or to the difference of the quantity of attraction  belonging to the sides and angles of those particles. The chemical motions  are distinguished by their being generally attended with an evident  decomposition or new combination of the active materials.    _3d._ The third class includes all the motions of the animal and vegetable  world; as well those of the vessels, which circulate their juices, and of  the muscles, which perform their locomotion, as those of the organs of  sense, which constitute their ideas.    This last class of motion is the subject of the following pages; which,  though conscious of their many imperfections, I hope may give some pleasure  to the patient reader, and contribute something to the knowledge and to the  cure of diseases.           *       *       *       *       *    SECT.

The nervous system has its origin from the brain, and is distributed  to every part of the body. Those nerves, which serve the senses,  principally arise from that part of the brain, which is lodged in the head;  and those, which serve the purposes of muscular motion, principally arise  from that part of the brain, which is lodged in the neck and back, and  which is erroneously called the spinal marrow. The ultimate fibrils of  these nerves terminate in the immediate organs of sense and muscular  fibres, and if a ligature be put on any part of their passage from the head  or spine, all motion and perception cease in the parts beneath the  ligature.    2. The longitudinal muscular fibres compose the locomotive muscles, whose  contractions move the bones of the limbs and trunk, to which their  extremities are attached. The annular or spiral muscular fibres compose the  vascular muscles, which constitute the intestinal canal, the arteries,  veins, glands, and absorbent vessels.    3. The immediate organs of sense, as the retina of the eye, probably  consist of moving fibrils, with a power of contraction similar to that of  the larger muscles above described.    4. The cellular membrane consists of cells, which resemble those of a  sponge, communicating with each other, and connecting together all the  other parts of the body.    5. The arterial system consists of the aortal and the pulmonary artery,  which are attended through their whole course with their correspondent  veins. The pulmonary artery receives the blood from the right chamber of  the heart, and carries it to the minute extensive ramifications of the  lungs, where it is exposed to the action of the air on a surface equal to  that of the whole external skin, through the thin moist coats of those  vessels, which are spread on the air-cells, which constitute the minute  terminal ramifications of the wind-pipe. Here the blood changes its colour  from a dark red to a bright scarlet. It is then collected by the branches  of the pulmonary vein, and conveyed to the left chamber of the heart.    6. The aorta is another large artery, which receives the blood from the  left chamber of the heart, after it has been thus aerated in the lungs, and  conveys it by ascending and descending branches to every other part of the  system; the extremities of this artery terminate either in glands, as the  salivary glands, lacrymal glands, &c. or in capillary vessels, which are  probably less involuted glands; in these some fluid, as saliva, tears,  perspiration, are separated from the blood; and the remainder of the blood  is absorbed or drank up by branches of veins correspondent to the branches  of the artery; which are furnished with valves to prevent its return; and  is thus carried back, after having again changed its colour to a dark red,  to the right chamber of the heart. The circulation of the blood in the  liver differs from this general system; for the veins which drink up the  refluent blood from those arteries, which are spread on the bowels and  mesentery, unite into a trunk in the liver, and form a kind of artery,  which is branched into the whole substance of the liver, and is called the  vena portarum; and from which the bile is separated by the numerous hepatic  glands, which constitute that viscus.    7. The glands may be divided into three systems, the convoluted glands,  such as those above described, which separate bile, tears, saliva, &c.  Secondly, the glands without convolution, as the capillary vessels, which  unite the terminations of the arteries and veins; and separate both the  mucus, which lubricates the cellular membrane, and the perspirable matter,  which preserves the skin moist and flexible. And thirdly, the whole  absorbent system, consisting of the lacteals, which open their mouths into  the stomach and intestines, and of the lymphatics, which open their mouths  on the external surface of the body, and on the internal linings of all the  cells of the cellular membrane, and other cavities of the body.    These lacteal and lymphatic vessels are furnished with numerous valves to  prevent the return of the fluids, which they absorb, and terminate in  glands, called lymphatic glands, and may hence be considered as long necks  or mouths belonging to these glands.

A flare of light almost blinded her eyes. Every window opposite  her along the block, as far as she could see, was illuminated with a row of  lighted candles across the sash. The soft, unusual glow threw into relief  the pretty curtains and wreaths of green, and gave glimpses of cosy  interiors and flitting happy figures.    \"What a waste of candles!\" scolded Miss Terry. \"Folks are growing terribly  extravagant.\"    The street was white with snow which had fallen a few hours earlier, piled  in drifts along the curb of the little-traveled terrace. But the sidewalks  were neatly shoveled and swept clean, as became the eminently respectable  part of the city where Miss Terry lived. A long flight of steps, with iron  railing at the side, led down from the front door, upon which a silver  plate had for generations in decorous flourishes announced the name of  Terry.    Miss Terry returned to the play box and drew out between thumb and finger  the topmost toy. It happened to be a wooden box, with a wire hasp for  fastening the cover. Half unconsciously she pressed the spring, and a  hideous Jack-in-the-box sprang out to confront her with a squeak, a leering  smile, and a red nose. Miss Terry eyed him with disfavor.    \"I always did hate that thing,\" she said. \"Tom was continually frightening  me with it, I remember.\" As if to be rid of unwelcome memories she shut her  mouth tight, even as she shut Jack back into his box, snapping the spring  into place. \"This will do to begin with,\" she thought. She crossed to the  window, which she opened quickly, and tossed out the box, so that it fell  squarely in the middle of the sidewalk. Then closing the window and turning  down the lights in the room behind her, Miss Terry hid in the folds of the  curtain and watched to see what would happen to Jack.    The street was quiet. Few persons passed on either side. At last she spied  two little ragamuffins approaching. They seemed to be Jewish lads of the  newsboy class, and they eyed the display of candles appraisingly. The  smaller boy first caught sight of the box in the middle of the sidewalk.    \"Hello! Wot's dis?\" he grunted, making a dash upon it.    \"Gee! Wot's up?\" responded the other, who was instantly at his elbow.    \"Gwan! Lemme look at it.\"    The smaller boy drew away and pressed the spring of the box eagerly.  _Ping!_ Out popped the Jack into his astonished face; whereupon he set up a  guffaw.    \"Give it here!\" commanded the bigger boy.    \"Naw! You let it alone! It's mine!\" asserted the other, edging away along  the curbstone. \"I saw it first. You can't have it.\"    \"Give it here. I saw it first myself. Hand it over, or I'll smash you!\"    The bigger boy advanced threateningly.    \"I won't!\" the other whimpered, clasping the box tightly under his jacket.    He started to run, but the bigger fellow was too quick for him. He pounced  across the sidewalk, and soon the twain were struggling in the snowdrift,  pummeling one another with might and main.    \"I told you so!\" commented Miss Terry from behind the curtain. \"Here's the  first show of the beautiful Christmas spirit that is supposed to be abroad.  Look at the little beasts fighting over something that neither of them  really wants!\"    Just then Miss Terry spied a blue-coated figure leisurely approaching. At  the same moment an instinct seemed to warn the struggling urchins.    \"Cop!\" said a muffled voice from the pile of arms and legs, and in an  instant two black shadows were flitting down the street; but not before the  bigger boy had wrenched the box from the pocket of the little chap.    \"So that is the end of experiment number one,\" quoth Miss Terry, smiling  grimly. \"It happened just about as I expected. They will be fighting again  as soon as they are out of sight. They are Jews; but that doesn't make any  difference about the Christmas spirit. Now let's see what becomes of the  next experiment.\"          CHAPTER III    THE FLANTON DOG      She returned to the play box by the fire, and rummaged for a few minutes  among the tangled toys. Then with something like a chuckle she drew out a  soft, pale creature with four wobbly legs.    \"The Flanton Dog!\" she said. \"Well, I vow! I had forgotten all about him.  It was Tom who coined the name for him because he was made of Canton  flannel.\"    She stood the thing up on the table as well as his weak legs would allow,  and inspected him critically. He certainly was a forlorn specimen. One of  the black beads which had served him for eyes was gone. His ears, which had  originally stood up saucily on his head, now drooped in limp dejection. One  of them was a mere shapeless rag hanging by a thread. He was dirty and  discolored, and his tail was gone. But still he smiled with his red-thread  mouth and seemed trying to make the best of things.    \"What a nightmare!\" said Miss Terry contemptuously. \"I know there isn't a  child in the city who wants such a looking thing. Why, even the Animal  Rescue folks would give the boys a 'free shot' at that. This isn't going to  bring out any Christmas spirit,\" she sneered. \"I will try it and see.\"    Once more she lifted the window and tossed the dog to the sidewalk. He  rolled upon his back and lay pathetically with crooked legs yearning  upward, still smiling. Hardly had Miss Terry time to conceal herself behind  the curtain when she saw a figure approaching, airily waving a stick.    \"No ragamuffin this time,\" she said. \"Hello! It is that good-for-nothing  young Cooper fellow from the next block. They say he is a millionaire.  Well, he isn't even going to see the Flanton Dog.\"    The young man came swinging along, debonairly; he was whistling under his  breath. He was a dapper figure in a long coat and a silk hat, under which  the candles lighted a rather silly face. When he reached the spot in the  sidewalk where the Flanton Dog lay, he paused a moment looking down. Then  he poked the object with his stick. On the other side of the street a  mother and her little boy were passing at the time. The child's eyes caught  sight of the dog on the sidewalk, and he hung back, watching to see what  the young man would do to it. But his mother drew him after her. Just then  an automobile came panting through the snow. With a quick movement Cooper  picked up the dog on the end of his stick and tossed it into the street,  under the wheels of the machine. The baby across the street uttered a howl  of anguish at the sight. Miss Terry herself was surprised to feel a pang  shoot through her as the car passed over the queer old toy. She retreated  from the window quickly.    \"Well, that's the end of Flanton,\" she said with half a sigh. \"I knew that  fellow was a brute. I might have expected something like that. But it  looked so--so--\" She hesitated for a word, and did not finish her sentence,  but bit her lip and sniffed cynically.          CHAPTER IV    THE NOAH'S ARK      \"Now, what comes next?\" Miss Terry rummaged in the box until her fingers  met something odd-shaped, long, and smooth-sided. With some difficulty she  drew out the object, for it was of good size.    \"H'm! The old Noah's ark,\" she said. \"I wonder if all the animals are in  there.\"    She lifted the cover, and turned out into her lap the long-imprisoned  animals and their round-bodied chief. Mrs. Noah and her sons had long since  disappeared. But the ark-builder, hatless and one-armed, still presided  over a menagerie of sorry beasts. Scarcely one could boast of being a  quadruped. To few of them the years had spared a tail. From their close  resemblance in their misery, it was not hard to believe in the kinship of  all animal life. She took them up and examined them curiously one by one.  Finally she selected a shapeless slate-colored block from the mass. \"This  was the elephant,\" she mused. \"I remember when Tom stepped on him and  smashed his trunk. 'I guess I'm going to be an expressman when I grow up,'  he said, looking sorry. Tom was always full of his jokes. Now I'll try this  and see what happens to the ark on its last voyage.\"    Just then there was a noise outside. An automobile honked past, and Miss  Terry shuddered, recalling the pathetic end of the Flanton Dog, which had  given her quite a turn.    \"I hate those horrid machines!\" she exclaimed. \"They seem like Juggernaut.  I'd like to forbid their going through this street.\"    She crowded the elephant with Noah and the rest of his charge back into the  ark and closed the lid. \"I can't throw this out of the window,\" she  reflected. \"They would spill. I must take it out on the sidewalk. Land! The  fire's going out! That girl doesn't know how to build fires so they will  keep.\"    She laid the Noah's ark on the table, and going to the closet tugged out  several big logs, which she arranged geometrically. About laying fires, as  about most other things, Miss Terry had her own positive theories. Taking  the bellows in hand she blew furiously, and was presently rewarded with a  brisk blaze. She smiled with satisfaction, and trotted upstairs to find her  red knit shawl. With this about her shoulders she was prepared to brave the  December frost. Down the steps she went, and deposited the ark discreetly  at their foot; then returned to take up her position behind the curtains.    There were a good many people passing, but they seemed too preoccupied to  glance down at the sidewalk. They were nearly all hurrying in one  direction. Some were running in the middle of the street.    \"They are in a great hurry,\" sniffed Miss Terry disdainfully. \"One would  think they had something really important on hand. I suppose they are going  to hear the singing. Fiddlestick!\"    A man hastened by under the window; a woman; two children, a boy and a  girl, running and gesticulating eagerly. None of them noticed the Noah's  ark lying at the foot of the steps.    Miss Terry began to grow impatient. \"Are"]]]
