A ground plan of the ruin is shown in plate CXII and a general view in  plate CXIV. The area covered and inclosed by standing walls is about 43  by 59 feet, but the building is not exactly rectangular, nor do its  sides exactly face the cardinal points, notwithstanding many published  statements to that effect. The building comprised three central rooms,  each approximately 10 by 24 feet, arranged side by side with the longer  axes north and south, and two other rooms, each about 9 by 35 feet,  occupying, respectively, the northern and southern ends of the building,  and arranged transversely across the ends of the central rooms, the  longer axes running east and west. Excepting the central tier of rooms,  which was three stories high, all the walls rose to a height of two  stories above the ground. The northeastern and southeastern corners of  the structure have fallen, and large blocks of the material of which  they were composed are strewn upon the ground in the vicinity.    The exterior walls rise to a height of from 20 to 25 feet above the  ground. This height accommodated two stories, but the top of the wall is  from 1 to 2 feet higher than the roof level of the second story. The  middle room or space was built up three stories high, and the walls are  still standing to a height of 28 to 30 feet above the ground level. The  tops of the walls, while rough and greatly eroded, are approximately  level. The exterior surface of the walls is rough, as shown in the  illustrations, but the interior walls of the rooms are finished with a  remarkable degree of smoothness, so much so that it has attracted the  attention of everyone who has visited the ruin. Plate CXV shows this  feature. At the ground level the exterior wall is from 31/2 to 41/2 feet  thick, and in one place over 5 feet thick. The interior walls are from 3  to 4 feet thick. At the tops the walls are about 2 feet thick. The  building was constructed by crude methods, thoroughly aboriginal in  character, and there is no uniformity in its measurements. The walls,  even in the same room, are not of even thickness; the floor joists were  seldom in a straight line, and measurements made at similar places (for  example, at the two ends of a room) seldom agree.    Casa Grande is often referred to as an adobe structure, but this use of  the term is misleading. Adobe construction consists of the use of molded  brick, dried in the sun, but not baked. The walls here are composed of  huge blocks of rammed earth, 3 to 5 feet long, 2 feet high and 3 to 4  feet thick. These blocks were not molded and then laid in the wall, but  were manufactured in place.    Plate CXVI shows the character of these blocks. The material employed  was admirably suited for the purpose, being when dry almost as hard as  sandstone and nearly as durable. A building with walls of this material  would last indefinitely, provided a few slight repairs were made at the  conclusion of each rainy season. When abandoned, however, sapping at the  ground level would commence and would in time bring down all the walls;  yet in the two centuries which have elapsed since Padre Kino's visit to  this place--and Casa Grande was then a ruin--there has been but little  destruction from the elements, the damage done by relic hunters during  the last twenty years being, in fact, much greater than that due to all  causes in the preceding two centuries.    The building was well provided with doorways and other openings,  arranged in pairs, one above the other. There were doorways from each  room into every adjoining room, except that the rooms of the middle tier  were entered only from the east. Some of the openings were not used, and  were closed with blocks of solid masonry, built into them long prior to  the final abandonment of the structure.      CONDITION OF CASA GRANDE IN 1891    The south and east fronts of Casa Grande seem to have suffered,  particularly from the weather, and here rainstorms have probably caused  some of the damage. The outer faces of the walls are of the same  material as the wall mass, all the masonry being composed of earth from  the immediate site. In the construction of the walls this soil was laid  up in successive courses of varying thickness, whose limits form clearly  defined and approximately horizontal joints. The northeast and southeast  corners of the building have entirely fallen away, and low mounds of  their debris still show many knobs and lumps, parts of the original wall  mass.    The destruction of the walls was due mainly to undermining at the ground  level. The character of this undermining is shown in many of the  illustrations to this report, especially in plate CXVI, and its extent  is indicated on the accompanying ground plan (plate CXVII) by dotted  lines within the wall mass. Although the material of which the walls are  composed is very hard when dry, and capable of resisting the destructive  influences to which it has been subjected for a long time, yet under  certain conditions it becomes more yielding. The excessively dry climate  of this region, which in one respect has made the preservation of the  ruin possible, has also furnished, in its periodic sandstorms, a most  efficient agent of destruction. The amount of moisture in the soil is so  small as scarcely to be detected, but what there is in the soil next to  the walls is absorbed by the latter, rising doubtless by capillary  attraction to a height of a foot or more from the ground. This portion  of the wall being then more moist than the remainder, although possibly  only in an infinitesimal degree, is more subject to erosion by flying  sand in the windstorms so frequent in this region, and gradually the  base of the wall is eaten away until the support becomes insufficient  and the wall falls en masse. The plan shows that in some places the  walls have been eaten away at the ground level to a depth of more than a  foot. Portions of the south wall were in a dangerous condition and  likely to fall at any time.    Visiting tourists have done much damage by their vandalism. They have  torn out and carried away every lintel and every particle of visible  wood in the building. After the removal of the lintels a comparatively  short time elapses before the falling in of the wall above. Apparently  but a small amount of this damage can be attributed to rainstorms,  which, although rare in this region, are sometimes violent. There is  evidence that the present height of the walls is nearly the original  height, in other words, that the loss from surface erosion in several  centuries has been trifling, although numerous opinions to the contrary  have been expressed by causal observers. The eastern wall has suffered  more from this cause than the others; a belt on the northern half,  apparently softer than the remainder of the wall, has been eaten away to  a depth of nearly a foot. The interior wall faces are in good condition  generally, except about openings and in places near the top.    Evidences of the original flooring are preserved in several of the  rooms, especially in the north room. The flooring conformed to the  pueblo type in the use of a series of principal beams, about 3 inches in  diameter, above which was a secondary series smaller in size and placed  quite close together, and above this again a layer of rushes with a  coating of clay. All the walls show evidences of the principal series of  beams in the line of holes formed by their ends where they were embedded  in the walls. In the south wall, in parts of the east wall high up on  the level of the upper roof, and in parts of other walls a few stumps of  floor beams remained. These specimens of aboriginal woodwork have  survived only because they are not in sight from the ground, and their  existence therefore was not suspected by the tourists. Evidence of the  other features of the floor construction can be seen on the walls in  places where they have left an imprint, as described in the memoir  previously cited.    No single opening remains intact, as the lintels have been removed from  every one of them. This is particularly unfortunate, for openings at  their best are an element of weakness in a wall, and here each opening,  after the lintel was removed, became, as it were, a center of weakness  from which the destruction of the wall mass gradually proceeded further  and further.      PLANS FOR THE REPAIRS    The plans for the repair of the ruin and its preservation included the  reservation of the area covered by remains and, if possible, its  inclosure, for within that area are exhibited all the various degrees of  decay and disintegration which clearly link the comparatively well  preserved Casa Grande with the numerous almost obliterated ruins along  the Gila and the Salt, whose vestiges will become even less distinct as  time passes and cultivation increases.    It was deemed necessary to remove all the rubbish and debris within the  building and from an area measuring 10 feet from the outer walls in  every direction. Plate CXVII shows the extent of this area, and six  sections are shown in plates CXVIII and CXIX, three on east-and-west  lines and three on north-and-south lines. The lines along which these  sections were made are indicated on the plan, plate CXVII. The ground  level was determined by excavation, and is of course only approximate.  The sections show the estimated amount of debris which was to be  removed. Aside from other considerations, it was necessary to uncover  the walls to the ground level in order to do the necessary underpinning.    It was planned to underpin the walls, where erosion at the ground level  had weakened them, with hard-burned brick laid in cement mortar. Plate  CXVII shows in a measure the extent of this erosion.

Giry, now  deceased, who had charge of the ghost's private box.  All these were of  the greatest assistance to me; and, thanks to them, I shall be able to  reproduce those hours of sheer love and terror, in their smallest  details, before the reader's eyes.    And I should be ungrateful indeed if I omitted, while standing on the  threshold of this dreadful and veracious story, to thank the present  management the Opera, which has so kindly assisted me in all my  inquiries, and M. Messager in particular, together with M. Gabion, the  acting-manager, and that most amiable of men, the architect intrusted  with the preservation of the building, who did not hesitate to lend me  the works of Charles Garnier, although he was almost sure that I would  never return them to him.  Lastly, I must pay a public tribute to the  generosity of my friend and former collaborator, M. J. Le Croze, who  allowed me to dip into his splendid theatrical library and to borrow  the rarest editions of books by which he set great store.    GASTON LEROUX.        Chapter I  Is it the Ghost?      It was the evening on which MM. Debienne and Poligny, the managers of  the Opera, were giving a last gala performance to mark their  retirement.  Suddenly the dressing-room of La Sorelli, one of the  principal dancers, was invaded by half-a-dozen young ladies of the  ballet, who had come up from the stage after \"dancing\" Polyeucte.  They  rushed in amid great confusion, some giving vent to forced and  unnatural laughter, others to cries of terror.  Sorelli, who wished to  be alone for a moment to \"run through\" the speech which she was to make  to the resigning managers, looked around angrily at the mad and  tumultuous crowd.  It was little Jammes--the girl with the tip-tilted  nose, the forget-me-not eyes, the rose-red cheeks and the lily-white  neck and shoulders--who gave the explanation in a trembling voice:    \"It's the ghost!\"  And she locked the door.    Sorelli's dressing-room was fitted up with official, commonplace  elegance.  A pier-glass, a sofa, a dressing-table and a cupboard or two  provided the necessary furniture.  On the walls hung a few engravings,  relics of the mother, who had known the glories of the old Opera in the  Rue le Peletier; portraits of Vestris, Gardel, Dupont, Bigottini.  But  the room seemed a palace to the brats of the corps de ballet, who were  lodged in common dressing-rooms where they spent their time singing,  quarreling, smacking the dressers and hair-dressers and buying one  another glasses of cassis, beer, or even rhum, until the call-boy's  bell rang.    Sorelli was very superstitious.  She shuddered when she heard little  Jammes speak of the ghost, called her a \"silly little fool\" and then,  as she was the first to believe in ghosts in general, and the Opera  ghost in particular, at once asked for details:    \"Have you seen him?\"    \"As plainly as I see you now!\" said little Jammes, whose legs were  giving way beneath her, and she dropped with a moan into a chair.    Thereupon little Giry--the girl with eyes black as sloes, hair black as  ink, a swarthy complexion and a poor little skin stretched over poor  little bones--little Giry added:    \"If that's the ghost, he's very ugly!\"    \"Oh, yes!\" cried the chorus of ballet-girls.    And they all began to talk together.  The ghost had appeared to them in  the shape of a gentleman in dress-clothes, who had suddenly stood  before them in the passage, without their knowing where he came from.  He seemed to have come straight through the wall.    \"Pooh!\" said one of them, who had more or less kept her head.  \"You see  the ghost everywhere!\"    And it was true.  For several months, there had been nothing discussed  at the Opera but this ghost in dress-clothes who stalked about the  building, from top to bottom, like a shadow, who spoke to nobody, to  whom nobody dared speak and who vanished as soon as he was seen, no one  knowing how or where.  As became a real ghost, he made no noise in  walking.  People began by laughing and making fun of this specter  dressed like a man of fashion or an undertaker; but the ghost legend  soon swelled to enormous proportions among the corps de ballet.  All  the girls pretended to have met this supernatural being more or less  often.  And those who laughed the loudest were not the most at ease.  When he did not show himself, he betrayed his presence or his passing  by accident, comic or serious, for which the general superstition held  him responsible.  Had any one met with a fall, or suffered a practical  joke at the hands of one of the other girls, or lost a powderpuff, it  was at once the fault of the ghost, of the Opera ghost.    After all, who had seen him?  You meet so many men in dress-clothes at  the Opera who are not ghosts.  But this dress-suit had a peculiarity of  its own.  It covered a skeleton.  At least, so the ballet-girls said.  And, of course, it had a death's head.    Was all this serious?  The truth is that the idea of the skeleton came  from the description of the ghost given by Joseph Buquet, the chief  scene-shifter, who had really seen the ghost.  He had run up against  the ghost on the little staircase, by the footlights, which leads to  \"the cellars.\"  He had seen him for a second--for the ghost had  fled--and to any one who cared to listen to him he said:    \"He is extraordinarily thin and his dress-coat hangs on a skeleton  frame.  His eyes are so deep that you can hardly see the fixed pupils.  You just see two big black holes, as in a dead man's skull.  His skin,  which is stretched across his bones like a drumhead, is not white, but  a nasty yellow.  His nose is so little worth talking about that you  can't see it side-face; and THE ABSENCE of that nose is a horrible  thing TO LOOK AT.  All the hair he has is three or four long dark locks  on his forehead and behind his ears.\"    This chief scene-shifter was a serious, sober, steady man, very slow at  imagining things.  His words were received with interest and amazement;  and soon there were other people to say that they too had met a man in  dress-clothes with a death's head on his shoulders.  Sensible men who  had wind of the story began by saying that Joseph Buquet had been the  victim of a joke played by one of his assistants.  And then, one after  the other, there came a series of incidents so curious and so  inexplicable that the very shrewdest people began to feel uneasy.    For instance, a fireman is a brave fellow!  He fears nothing, least of  all fire!  Well, the fireman in question, who had gone to make a round  of inspection in the cellars and who, it seems, had ventured a little  farther than usual, suddenly reappeared on the stage, pale, scared,  trembling, with his eyes starting out of his head, and practically  fainted in the arms of the proud mother of little Jammes.[1]  And why?  Because he had seen coming toward him, AT THE LEVEL OF HIS HEAD, BUT  WITHOUT A BODY ATTACHED TO IT, A HEAD OF FIRE!  And, as I said, a  fireman is not afraid of fire.    The fireman's name was Pampin.    The corps de ballet was flung into consternation.  At first sight, this  fiery head in no way corresponded with Joseph Buquet's description of  the ghost.  But the young ladies soon persuaded themselves that the  ghost had several heads, which he changed about as he pleased.  And, of  course, they at once imagined that they were in the greatest danger.  Once a fireman did not hesitate to faint, leaders and front-row and  back-row girls alike had plenty of excuses for the fright that made  them quicken their pace when passing some dark corner or ill-lighted  corridor.  Sorelli herself, on the day after the adventure of the  fireman, placed a horseshoe on the table in front of the  stage-door-keeper's box, which every one who entered the Opera  otherwise than as a spectator must touch before setting foot on the  first tread of the staircase.  This horse-shoe was not invented by  me--any more than any other part of this story, alas!--and may still be  seen on the table in the passage outside the stage-door-keeper's box,  when you enter the Opera through the court known as the Cour de  l'Administration.    To return to the evening in question.    \"It's the ghost!\" little Jammes had cried.    An agonizing silence now reigned in the dressing-room. Nothing was  heard but the hard breathing of the girls.  At last, Jammes, flinging  herself upon the farthest corner of the wall, with every mark of real  terror on her face, whispered:    \"Listen!\"    Everybody seemed to hear a rustling outside the door.  There was no  sound of footsteps.  It was like light silk sliding over the panel.  Then it stopped.    Sorelli tried to show more pluck than the others.  She went up to the  door and, in a quavering voice, asked:    \"Who's there?\"    But nobody answered.  Then feeling all eyes upon her, watching her last  movement, she made an effort to show courage, and said very loudly:    \"Is there any one behind the door?\"    \"Oh, yes, yes!  Of course there is!\" cried that little dried plum of a  Meg Giry, heroically holding Sorelli back by her gauze skirt.  \"Whatever you do, don't open the door!  Oh, Lord, don't open the door!\"    But Sorelli, armed with a dagger that never left her, turned the key  and drew back the door, while the ballet-girls retreated to the inner  dressing-room and Meg Giry sighed:    \"Mother!  Mother!\"    Sorelli looked into the passage bravely.  It was empty; a gas-flame, in  its glass prison, cast a red and suspicious light into the surrounding  darkness, without succeeding in dispelling it.  And the dancer slammed  the door again, with a deep sigh.    \"No,\" she said, \"there is no one there.\"    \"Still, we saw him!\"  Jammes declared, returning with timid little  steps to her place beside Sorelli.  \"He must be somewhere prowling  about.
