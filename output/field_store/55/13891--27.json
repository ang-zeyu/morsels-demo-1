Now, the striking feature of all this, it will be observed, is the fact  that the subject was an illiterate servant-girl to whom the Greek, Latin  and Hebrew quotations were _utterly unintelligible,_ that _normally she  had no recollection of them, that she had no idea of their meaning_,  and finally that they had been impressed upon her mind _without her  knowledge_ while she was engaged in her duties in her master's kitchen.    Several cases are reported by Dr. Abercrombie, and quoted by Professor  Hyslop, in which mental impressions long since forgotten beyond the  power of voluntary recall have been revived by the shock of accident or  disease. \"A man,\" he says, \"mentioned by Mr. Abernethy, had been born in  France, but had spent the greater part of his life in England, and, for  many years, had entirely lost the habit of speaking French. But when  under the care of Mr. Abernethy, on account of the effects of an injury  to the head, he always spoke French.\"    [Sidenote: _Speaking a Forgotten Tongue_]    \"A similar case occurred in St. Thomas Hospital, of a man who was in a  state of stupor in consequence of an injury to the head. On his partial  recovery he spoke a language which nobody in the hospital understood but  which was soon ascertained to be Welsh. It was then discovered that he  had been thirty years absent from Wales, and, before the accident, had  entirely forgotten his native language.    \"A lady mentioned by Dr. Pritchard, when in a state of delirium, spoke a  language which nobody about her understood, but which was afterward  discovered to be Welsh. None of her friends could form any conception of  the manner in which she had become acquainted with that language; but,  after much inquiry, it was discovered that in her childhood she had a  nurse, a native of a district on the coast of Brittany, the dialect of  which is closely analogous to Welsh. The lady at that time learned a  good deal of this dialect but had entirely forgotten it for many years  before this attack of fever.\"    [Sidenote: _Living Past Experiences Over Again_]    Dr. Carpenter relates the following incident in his \"Mental Physiology\":  \"Several years ago, the Rev. S. Mansard, now rector of Bethnal Green,  was doing clerical duty for a time at Hurstmonceaux, in Sussex; and  while there he one day went over with a party of friends to Pevensey  Castle, which he did not remember to have ever previously visited. As he  approached the gateway he became conscious of a very vivid impression  of having seen it before; and he 'seemed to himself to see' not only the  gateway itself, but donkeys beneath the arch and people on top of it.  His conviction that he must have visited the castle on some former  occasion--although he had neither the slightest remembrance of such a  visit nor any knowledge of having ever been in the neighborhood  previously to his residence at Hurstmonceaux--made him inquire from his  mother if she could throw any light on the matter. She at once informed  him that being in that part of the country, when he was but _eighteen  months old_, she had gone over with a large party and had taken him in  the pannier of a donkey; that the elders of the party, having brought  lunch with them, had eaten it on the roof of the gateway, where they  would have been seen from below, whilst he had been left on the ground  with the attendants and donkeys.\"    \"An Italian gentleman,\" says Dr. Rush, of Philadelphia, \"who died of  yellow fever in New York, in the beginning of his illness spoke English,  in the middle of it French, but on the day of his death only Italian.\"    Striking as these instances are, they are not unusual. Everyone on  reflection can supply similar instances. Who among us has not at one  time or another been impressed with a mysterious feeling of having at  some time in the past gone through the identical experience which he is  living now?    [Sidenote: _The \"Flash of Inspiration\"_]    On such occasions the sense of familiarity is sometimes so persistent as  to fill one with a strange feeling of the supernatural and to incline  our minds to the belief in a reincarnation.    The \"flash of inspiration\" which, for the lawyer, solves a novel legal  issue arising in the trial of a case, or, for the surgeon, sees him  successfully through the emergencies of a delicate operation, has its  origin in the forgotten learning of past experience and study.    [Sidenote: _The Totality of Retention_]    Succeeding books in this _Course_ will bring to light numerous other  facts less commonly observed, drawn indeed from the study of abnormal  mental states, indicating that we retain a great volume of  sense-impressions of whose very recording we are at the time unaware.  In other words, all the evidences point to the absolute totality of our  retention of all sensory experiences. They indicate that every  sense-impression you ever received, whether you actually perceived and  were conscious of it or not, has been retained and preserved in your  memory, and can be \"brought to mind\" when you understand the proper  method of calling it into service.    A vast wealth of facts is stored in the treasure vaults of your mind,  but there are certain inner compartments to which you have lost the  combination.    [Sidenote: _Possibilities of Self-Discovery_]    The author of \"Thoughts on Business\" says: \"It is a great day in a man's  life when he truly begins to discover himself. The latent capacities of  every man are greater than he realizes, and he may find them if he  diligently seeks for them. A man may own a tract of land for many years  without knowing its value. He may think of it as merely a pasture. But  one day he discovers evidences of coal and finds a rich vein beneath his  land. While mining and prospecting for coal he discovers deposits of  granite. In boring for water he strikes oil. Later he discovers a vein  of copper ore, and after that silver and gold. These things were there  all the time--even when he thought of his land merely as a pasture. But  they have a value only when they are discovered and utilized.\"    \"Not every pasture contains deposits of silver and gold, neither oil  nor granite, nor even coal. But beneath the surface of every man there  must be, in the nature of things, a latent capacity greater than has yet  been discovered. And one discovery must lead to another until the man  finds the deep wealth of his own possibilities. History is full of the  acts of men who discovered somewhat of their own capacity; but history  has yet to record the man who fully discovered all that he might have  been.\"    [Sidenote: _\"Acres of Diamonds\"_]    You who are a bit vain of your visits to other lands, your wide reading,  your experience of men and things; you who secretly lament that so  little of what you have seen and read remains with you, behold, your  \"acres of diamonds\" are within you, needing but the mystic formula that  shall reveal the treasure!          THE MECHANISM OF RECALL    [Illustration: Decorative Header]      CHAPTER III    THE MECHANISM OF RECALL      [Sidenote: _The Right Stimulus_]    Somehow, somewhere, all experiences, whether subject to voluntary recall  or not, are preserved, and are capable of reproduction when the right  stimulus comes along.    And it is a law that _those experiences which are associated with each  other, whether ideas, emotions or voluntary or involuntary muscular  movements, tend to become bound together into groups, and these groups  tend to become bound together into systems_.    [Sidenote: _\"Complexes\" of Experience_]    Such a system of associated groups of experiences is technically known  as a \"complex.\"    Pay particular attention to these definitions, as \"groups\" of ideas and  \"complexes\" of ideas, emotions and muscular movements are terms that we  shall constantly employ.    You learned in a former lesson that mental experiences may consist not  only of sense-perceptions based on excitements arising in the memory  nerves, but also of bodily emotions, the \"feeling tones\" of ideas, and  of muscular movements based on stimuli arising in the motor nerves.    _Groups consist, therefore, not only of associated ideas, but of  associated ideas coupled with their emotional qualities and impulses to  muscular movements._    All groups bound together by a mutually related idea constitute a single  \"complex.\" Every memory you have is an illustration of such \"complexes.\"    [Sidenote: _The Thrill of Recollection_]    Suppose, for example, you once gained success in a business deal. Your  recollection of the other persons concerned in that transaction, of any  one detail in the transaction itself, will be accompanied by the faster  heartbeat, the quickened circulation of the blood, the feeling of  triumph and elation that attended the original experience.    [Sidenote: _\"Complexes\" and Functional Derangements_]    Complexes formed out of harrowing earthquakes, robberies, murders or  other dreadful spectacles, which were originally accompanied on the part  of the onlooker by trembling, perspiration and palpitation of the  heart, when lived over again in memory, are again accompanied by all  these bodily activities. Your memory of a hairbreadth escape will bring  to your cheek the pallor that marked it when the incident occurred.    The formation and existence of \"complexes\" explains the origin of many  functional diseases of the body--that is to say, diseases involving no  loss or destruction of tissue, but consisting simply in a failure on the  part of some bodily organ to perform its allotted function naturally and  effectively.    [Sidenote: _Automatically Working Mental Mechanisms_]    Thus, in hay fever or \"rose cold\" the tears, the inflammation of the  membranes of the nose, the cough, the other trying symptoms, all are  linked with the sight of a rose, or dust, or sunlight, or some other  outside fact to which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17851"],[0,"The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave (#2)"],[1,"had  grown very fond of me. For some time I could scarcely believe that Mrs.  Pruden was in earnest, till I received orders for my immediate  return.--Dear Miss Fanny! how she cried at parting with me, whilst I  kissed and hugged the baby, thinking I should never see him again. I left  Mrs. Pruden's, and walked home with a heart full of sorrow. The idea of  being sold away from my mother and Miss Betsey was so frightful, that I  dared not trust myself to think about it. We had been bought of Mr.  Myners, as I have mentioned, by Miss Betsey's grandfather, and given to  her, so that we were by right _her_ property, and I never thought we  should be separated or sold away from her.    When I reached the house, I went in directly to Miss Betsey. I found her  in great distress; and she cried out as soon as she saw me, \"Oh, Mary! my  father is going to sell you all to raise money to marry that wicked woman.  You are _my_ slaves, and he has no right to sell you; but it is all to  please her.\" She then told me that my mother was living with her father's  sister at a house close by, and I went there to see her. It was a  sorrowful meeting; and we lamented with a great and sore crying our  unfortunate situation. \"Here comes one of my poor picaninnies!\" she said,  the moment I came in, \"one of the poor slave-brood who are to be sold  to-morrow.\"    Oh dear! I cannot bear to think of that day,--it is too much.--It recalls  the great grief that filled my heart, and the woeful thoughts that passed  to and fro through my mind, whilst listening to the pitiful words of my  poor mother, weeping for the loss of her children. I wish I could find  words to tell you all I then felt and suffered. The great God above alone  knows the thoughts of the poor slave's heart, and the bitter pains which  follow such separations as these. All that we love taken away from us--Oh,  it is sad, sad! and sore to be borne!--I got no sleep that night for  thinking of the morrow; and dear Miss Betsey was scarcely less distressed.  She could not bear to part with her old playmates, and she cried sore and  would not be pacified.    The black morning at length came; it came too soon for my poor mother and  us. Whilst she was putting on us the new osnaburgs in which we were to be  sold, she said, in a sorrowful voice, (I shall never forget it!) \"See, I  am _shrouding_ my poor children; what a task for a mother!\"--She then  called Miss Betsey to take leave of us. \"I am going to carry my little  chickens to market,\" (these were her very words,) \"take your last look of  them; may be you will see them no more.\" \"Oh, my poor slaves! my own  slaves!\" said dear Miss Betsey, \"you belong to me; and it grieves my heart  to part with you.\"--Miss Betsey kissed us all, and, when she left us, my  mother called the rest of the slaves to bid us good bye. One of them, a  woman named Moll, came with her infant in her arms. \"Ay!\" said my mother,  seeing her turn away and look at her child with the tears in her eyes,  \"your turn will come next.\" The slaves could say nothing to comfort us;  they could only weep and lament with us. When I left my dear little  brothers and the house in which I had been brought up, I thought my heart  would burst.    Our mother, weeping as she went, called me away with the children Hannah  and Dinah, and we took the road that led to Hamble Town, which we reached  about four o'clock in the afternoon. We followed my mother to the  market-place, where she placed us in a row against a large house, with our  backs to the wall and our arms folded across our breasts. I, as the  eldest, stood first, Hannah next to me, then Dinah; and our mother stood  beside, crying over us. My heart throbbed with grief and terror so  violently, that I pressed my hands quite tightly across my breast, but I  could not keep it still, and it continued to leap as though it would burst  out of my body. But who cared for that? Did one of the many by-standers,  who were looking at us so carelessly, think of the pain that wrung the  hearts of the negro woman and her young ones? No, no! They were not all  bad, I dare say; but slavery hardens white people's hearts towards the  blacks; and many of them were not slow to make their remarks upon us  aloud, without regard to our grief--though their light words fell like  cayenne on the fresh wounds of our hearts. Oh those white people have  small hearts who can only feel for themselves.    At length the vendue master, who was to offer us for sale like sheep or  cattle, arrived, and asked my mother which was the eldest. She said  nothing, but pointed to me. He took me by the hand, and led me out into  the middle of the street, and, turning me slowly round, exposed me to the  view of those who attended the vendue. I was soon surrounded by strange  men, who examined and handled me in the same manner that a butcher would a  calf or a lamb he was about to purchase, and who talked about my shape and  size in like words--as if I could no more understand their meaning than  the dumb beasts. I was then put up to sale. The bidding commenced at a few  pounds, and gradually rose to fifty-seven,[1] when I was knocked down to  the highest bidder; and the people who stood by said that I had fetched a  great sum for so young a slave.    [Footnote 1: Bermuda currency; about L38 sterling.]    I then saw my sisters led forth, and sold to different owners; so that we  had not the sad satisfaction of being partners in bondage. When the sale  was over, my mother hugged and kissed us, and mourned over us, begging of  us to keep up a good heart, and do our duty to our new masters. It was a  sad parting; one went one way, one another, and our poor mammy went home  with nothing.[2]    [Footnote 2: Let the reader compare the above affecting account, taken  down from the mouth of this negro woman, with the following description of  a vendue of slaves at the Cape of Good Hope, published by me in 1826, from  the letter of a friend,--and mark their similarity in several  characteristic circumstances. The resemblance is easily accounted for:  slavery wherever it prevails produces similar effects.--\"Having heard that  there was to be a sale of cattle, farm stock, &c. by auction, at a  Veld-Cornet's in the vicinity, we halted our waggon one day for the  purpose of procuring a fresh spann of oxen. Among the stock of the farm  sold, was a female slave and her three children. The two eldest children  were girls, the one about thirteen years of age, and the other about  eleven; the youngest was a boy. The whole family were exhibited together,  but they were sold separately, and to different purchasers. The farmers  examined them as if they had been so many head of cattle. While the sale  was going on, the mother and her children were exhibited on a table, that  they might be seen by the company, which was very large. There could not  have been a finer subject for an able painter than this unhappy group. The  tears, the anxiety, the anguish of the mother, while she met the gaze of  the multitude, eyed the different countenances of the bidders, or cast a  heart-rending look upon the children; and the simplicity and touching  sorrow of the young ones, while they clung to their distracted parent,  wiping their eyes, and half concealing their faces,--contrasted with the  marked insensibility and jocular countenances of the spectators and  purchasers,--furnished a striking commentary on the miseries of slavery,  and its debasing effects upon the hearts of its abettors. While the woman  was in this distressed situation she was asked, 'Can you feed sheep?' Her  reply was so indistinct that it escaped me; but it was probably in the  negative, for her purchaser rejoined, in a loud and harsh voice, 'Then I  will teach you with the sjamboc,' (a whip made of the rhinoceros' hide.)  The mother and her three children were sold to three separate purchasers;  and they were literally torn from each other.\"--_Ed._]    My new master was a Captain I----, who lived at Spanish Point. After  parting with my mother and sisters, I followed him to his store, and he  gave me into the charge of his son, a lad about my own age, Master Benjy,  who took me to my new home. I did not know where I was going, or what my  new master would do with me. My heart was quite broken with grief, and my  thoughts went back continually to those from whom I had been so suddenly  parted. \"Oh, my mother! my mother!\" I kept saying to myself, \"Oh, my mammy  and my sisters and my brothers, shall I never see you again!\"    Oh, the trials! the trials! they make the salt water come into my eyes  when I think of the days in which I was afflicted--the times that are  gone; when I mourned and grieved with a young heart for those whom I  loved.    It was night when I reached my new home. The house was large, and built at  the bottom of a very high hill; but I could not see much of it that night.  I saw too much of it afterwards. The stones and the timber were the best  things in it; they were not so hard as the hearts of the owners.[3]    [Footnote 3: These strong expressions, and all of a similar character in  this little narrative, are given verbatim as uttered by Mary  Prince.--_Ed._]    Before I entered the house, two slave women, hired from another owner, who  were at work in the yard, spoke to me, and asked who I belonged to? I  replied, \"I am come to live here.\" \"Poor child, poor child!\" they both  said; \"you must keep a good heart, if you are to live here.\"--When I went  in, I stood up crying in a corner. Mrs. I---- came and took off my hat, a  little black silk hat Miss Pruden made for me, and said in a rough voice,  \"You are not come here to stand up in corners and cry, you are come here  to work.\" She then put a child into my arms, and, tired as I was, I was  forced instantly to take up my old occupation of a nurse.--I could not  bear to look at my mistress, her countenance was so stern.
