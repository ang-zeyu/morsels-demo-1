The diffidence which Lewis  discovered of their fidelity, forwarded this general propension towards  the king; and when the French prince refused the government of the  castle of Hertford to Robert Fitz-Walter, who had been so active against  the late king, and who claimed that fortress as his property, they  plainly saw that the English were excluded from every trust, and that  foreigners had engrossed all the confidence and affection of their new  sovereign.[**] The excommunication, too, denounced by the legate  against all the adherents of Lewis, failed not, in the turn which men's  dispositions had taken, to produce a mighty effect upon them; and they  were easily persuaded to consider a cause as impious, for which they had  already entertained an unsurmountable aversion.[***] Though Lewis made  a journey to France, and brought over succors from that kingdom [****]  he found, on his return, that his party was still more weakened by the  desertion of his English confederates, and that the death of John had,  contrary to his expectations, given an incurable wound to his cause.  The earls of Salisbury Arundel, and Warrenne, together with William  Mareschal, eldest son of the protector, had embraced Henry's party;  and every English nobleman was plainly watching for an opportunity of  returning to his allegiance.         * Rymer, vol. i. p. 215.

Pembroke was so much strengthened by these accessions, that he ventured  to invest Mount Sorel; though, upon the approach of the count of Perche  with the French army, he desisted from his enterprise, and raised the  siege.[*] The count, elated with this success, marched to Lincoln; and  being admitted into the town, he began to attack the castle, which he  soon reduced to extremity. The protector summoned all his forces from  every quarter, in order to relieve a place of such importance; and he  appeared so much superior to the French, that they shut themselves up  within the city, and resolved to act upon the defensive.[**] But the  garrison of the castle, having received a strong reenforcement, made a  vigorous sally upon the besiegers; while the English army, by concert,  assaulted them in the same instant from without, mounted the walls by  scalade, and bearing down all resistance, entered the city sword in  hand. Lincoln was delivered over to be pillaged; the French army was  totally routed; the count de Perche, with only two persons more,  was killed, but many of the chief commanders, and about four hundred  knights, were made prisoners by the English.[***] So little blood was  shed in this important action, which decided the fate of one of the  most powerful kingdoms in Europe; and such wretched soldiers were those  ancient barons, who yet were unacquainted with every thing but arms!         * M. Paris, p. 203         ** Chron. Dunst vol. i. p. 81.         *** M. Paris, p. 204, 205.         **** Chron. de Mailr. p. 195.    Prince Lewis was informed of this fatal event while employed in the  siege of Dover, which was still valiantly defended against him by Hubert  de Burgh. He immediately retreated to London, the centre and life of his  party; and he there received intelligence of a new disaster, which  put an end to all his hopes. A French fleet, bringing over a strong,  reenforcement, had appeared on the coast of Kent; where they were  attacked by the English under the command of Philip d'Albiney, and were  routed with considerable loss. D'Albiney employed a stratagem against  them, which is said to have contributed to the victory: having gained  the wind of the French, he came down upon them with violence; and  throwing in their faces a great quantity of quick lime, which he  purposely carried on board, he so blinded them, that they were disabled  from defending themselves.[*]    After this second misfortune of the French, the English barons  hastened every where to make peace with the protector, and, by an early  submission, to prevent those attainders to which they were exposed  on account of their rebellion. Lewis, whose cause was now totally  desperate, began to be anxious for the safety of his person, and was  glad, on any honorable conditions, to make his escape from a country  where he found every thing was now become hostile to him. He concluded  a peace with Pembroke, promised to evacuate the kingdom, and only  stipulated in return an indemnity to his adherents, and a restitution of  their honors and fortunes, together with the free and equal enjoyment  of those liberties which had been granted to the rest of the nation.[**]  Thus was happily ended a civil war which seemed to be founded on the  most incurable hatred and jealousy, and had threatened the kingdom with  the most fatal consequences.    The precautions which the king of France used in the conduct of this  whole affair are remarkable. He pretended that his son had accepted of  the offer from the English barons without his advice, and contrary to  his inclination: the armies sent to England were levied in Lewis's  name: when that prince came over to France for aid, his father publicly  refused to grant him any assistance, and would not so much as admit him  to his presence: even after Henry's party acquired the ascendant, and  Lewis was in danger of falling into the hands of his enemies, it was  Blanche of Castile his wife, not the king his father, who raised armies  and equipped fleets for his succor.[***]         *.

All these artifices were employed, not to satisfy the pope; for he had  too much penetration to be so easily imposed on: nor yet to deceive the  people; for they were too gross even for that purpose: they only served  for a coloring to Philip's cause; and in public affairs men are often  better pleased that the truth, though known to every body, should  be wrapped up under a decent cover, than if it were exposed in open  daylight to the eyes of all the world.    After the expulsion of the French, the prudence and equity of the  protector's subsequent conduct contributed to cure entirely those wounds  which had been made by intestine discord. He received the rebellious  barons into favor; observed strictly the terms of peace which he had  granted them; restored them to their possessions; and endeavored, by an  equal behavior, to bury all past animosities in perpetual oblivion.  The clergy alone, who had adhered to Lewis, were sufferers in this  revolution. As they had rebelled against their spiritual sovereign, by  disregarding the interdict and excommunication, it was not in Pembroke's  power to make any stipulations in their favor; and Gualo, the legate,  prepared to take vengeance on them for their disobedience.[*] Many of  them were deposed; many suspended; some banished; and all who escaped  punishment made atonement for their offence, by paying large sums to the  legate, who amassed an immense treasure by this expedient.    The earl of Pembroke did not long survive the pacification, which had  been chiefly owing to his wisdom and valor;[*] and he was succeeded in  the government by Peter des Roches, bishop of Winchester, and Hubert de  Burgh, the justiciary. The counsels of the latter were chiefly followed;  and had he possessed equal authority in the kingdom with Pembroke, he  seemed to be every way worthy of filling the place of that virtuous  nobleman. But the licentious and powerful barons, who had once broken  the reins of subjection to their prince, and had obtained by violence an  enlargement of their liberties and independence, could ill be restrained  by laws under a minority; and the people, no less than the king,  suffered from their outrages and disorders. They retained by force the  royal castles, which they had seized during the past convulsions, or  which had been committed to their custody by the protector;[**] they  usurped the king's demesnes;[***] they oppressed their vassals; they  infested their weaker neighbors; they invited all disorderly people to  enter in their retinue, and to live upon their lands; and they gave them  protection in all their robberies and extortions.         * Brady's App. No. 144.

No one was more infamous for these violent and illegal practices than  the earl of Albemarle; who, though he had early returned to his duty,  and had been serviceable in expelling the French, augmented to the  utmost the general disorder, and committed outrages in all the counties  of the north. In order to reduce him to obedience, Hubert seized an  opportunity of getting possession of Rockingham Castle, which Albemarle  had garrisoned"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19213"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part C. (#2)"],[1," of a more enlarged and more benevolent system of policy, he  exposed himself to many present inconveniences, by too anxiously  guarding against that future possible event, which might disjoin his  title from that of the princess whom he espoused. And while he treated  the Yorkists as enemies, he soon rendered them such, and taught them to  discuss that right to the crown, which he so carefully kept separate,  and to perceive its weakness and invalidity.    To these passions of Henry, as well as to his suspicious politics, we  are to ascribe the measures which he embraced two days after the battle  of Bosworth. Edward Plantagenet, earl of Warwick, son of the duke of  Clarence, was detained in a kind of confinement at Sherif-Hutton, in  Yorkshire, by the jealousy of his uncle Richard, whose title to the  throne was inferior to that of the young prince. Warwick had now reason  to expect better treatment, as he was no obstacle to the succession  either of Henry or Elizabeth; and from a youth of such tender years no  danger could reasonably be apprehended. But Sir Robert Willoughby was  despatched by Henry with orders to take him from Sherif-Hutton, to  convey him to the Tower, and to detain him in close custody.[*] The same  messenger carried directions, that the princess Elizabeth, who had been  confined to the same place, should be conducted to London, in order to  meet Henry, and there celebrate her nuptials.    Henry himself set out for the capital, and advanced by slow journeys.  Not to rouse the jealousy of the people, he took care to avoid all  appearance of military triumph; and so to restrain the insolence  of victory, that every thing about him bore the appearance of an  established monarch, making a peaceable progress through his dominions,  rather than of a prince who had opened his way to the throne by force of  arms. The acclamations of the people were every where loud, and no less  sincere and hearty. Besides that a young and victorious prince, on his  accession, was naturally the object of popularity, the nation promised  themselves great felicity from the new scene which opened before them.          * Bacon, p. 579. Polyd. Virg. p. 565.    During the course of near a whole century, the kingdom had been laid  waste by domestic wars and convulsions; and if at any time the noise of  arms had ceased, the sound of faction and discontent still threatened  new disorders. Henry, by his marriage with Elizabeth, seemed to insure a  union of the contending titles of the two families; and having prevailed  over a hated tyrant, who had anew disjointed the succession even of the  house of York, and had filled his own family with blood and murder,  he was every where attended with the unfeigned favor of the people.  Numerous and splendid troops of gentry and nobility accompanied  his progress. The mayor and companies of London received him as he  approached the city; the crowds of people and citizens were zealous  in their expressions of satisfaction. But Henry, amidst this general  effusion of joy, discovered still the stateliness and reserve of his  temper, which made him scorn to court popularity: he entered London in  a close chariot, and would not gratify the people with a sight of their  new sovereign.    But the king did not so much neglect the favor of the people, as  to delay giving them assurances of his marriage with the princess  Elizabeth, which he knew to be so passionately desired by the nation.  On his leaving Brittany, he had artfully dropped some hints that, if he  should succeed in his enterprise, and obtain the crown of England,  he would espouse Anne, the heir of that duchy; and the report of this  engagement had already reached England, and had begotten anxiety in  the people, and even in Elizabeth herself. Henry took care to dissipate  these apprehensions, by solemnly renewing, before the council and  principal nobility, the promise which he had already given to celebrate  his nuptials with the English princess. But though bound by honor,  as well as by interest, to complete this alliance, he was resolved to  postpone it till the ceremony of his own coronation should be finished,  and till his title should be recognized by parliament. Still anxious to  support his personal and hereditary right to the throne, he dreaded lest  a preceding marriage with the princess should imply a participation of  sovereignty in her, and raise doubts of his own title by the house of  Lancaster.    There raged at that time in London, and other parts of the kingdom,  a species of malady unknown to any other age or nation, the sweating  sickness, which occasioned the sudden death of great multitudes; though  it seemed not to be propagated by any contagious infection, but arose  from the general disposition of the air and of the human body. In less  than twenty-four hours the patient commonly died or recovered, but when  the pestilence had exerted its fury for a few weeks, it was observed,  either from alterations in the air, or from a more proper regimen which  had been discovered, to be considerably abated.[*] Preparations were  then made for the ceremony of Henry's coronation. In order to heighten  the splendor of that spectacle, he bestowed the rank of knight banneret  on twelve persons; and he conferred peerages on three. Jasper, earl of  Pembroke, his uncle, was created duke of Bedford; Thomas Lord Stanley,  his father-in-law, earl of Derby; and Edward Courtney, earl of  Devonshire. At the coronation, likewise, there appeared a new  institution, which the king had established for security as well as  pomp, a band of fifty archers, who were termed yeomen of the guard. But  lest the people should take umbrage at this unusual symptom of jealousy  in the prince, as if it implied a personal diffidence of his subjects,  he declared the institution to be perpetual. The ceremony of coronation  was performed by Cardinal Bourchier, archbishop of Canterbury.    The parliament being assembled at Westminster, the majority immediately  appeared to be devoted partisans of Henry; all persons of another  disposition either declining to stand in those dangerous times, or being  obliged to dissemble their principles and inclinations. The Lancastrian  party had every where been successful in the elections; and even many  had been returned who, during the prevalence of the house of York, had  been exposed to the rigor of law, and had been condemned by sentence  of attainder and outlawry. Their right to take seats in the house being  questioned, the case was referred to all the judges, who assembled in  the exchequer chamber, in order to deliberate on so delicate a subject.  The opinion delivered was prudent, and contained a just temperament  between law and expediency.[**] The judges determined, that the members  attainted should forbear taking their seat till an act were passed for  the reversal of their attainder. There was no difficulty in obtaining  this act; and in it were comprehended a hundred and seven persons of the  king's party.[***]         * Polyd. Virg. p. 567.         ** Bacon, p. 661.         *** Rot. Parl. 1 Henry VII. n. 2, 3, 4-15, 17, 26-65.    But a scruple was started of a nature still more important. The king  himself had been attainted; and his right of succession to the crown  might thence be exposed to some doubt The judges extricated themselves  from this dangerous question by asserting it as a maxim, \"That the crown  takes away all defects and stops in blood; and that from the time  the king assumed royal authority, the fountain was cleared, and all  attainders and corruptions of blood discharged.\" [*] Besides that the  case, from its urgent necessity, admitted of no deliberation, the judges  probably thought that no sentence of a court of judicature had authority  sufficient to bar the right of succession; that the heir of the crown  was commonly exposed to such jealousy as might often occasion stretches  of law and justice against him; and that a prince might even be engaged  in unjustifiable measures during his predecessor's reign, without  meriting on that account to be excluded from the throne, which was his  birthright.    With a parliament so obsequious, the king could not fail of obtaining  whatever act of settlement he was pleased to require. He seems only to  have entertained some doubt within himself on what claim he should found  his pretensions. In his speech to the parliament, he mentioned his just  title by hereditary right: but lest that title should not be esteemed  sufficient, he subjoined his claim by the judgment of God, who had given  him victory over his enemies. And again, lest this pretension should be  interpreted as assuming a right of conquest, he insured to his subjects  the full enjoyment of their former properties and possessions.    The entail of the crown was drawn according to the sense of the king,  and probably in words dictated by him. He made no mention in it of  the princess Elizabeth, nor of any branch of her family: but in other  respects the act was compiled with sufficient reserve and moderation.  He did not insist that it should contain a declaration or recognition of  his preceding right; as, on the other hand, he avoided the appearance of  a new law or ordinance. He chose a middle course which, as is generally  unavoidable in such cases, was not entirely free from uncertainty and  obscurity. It was voted, \"That the inheritance of the crown should rest,  remain, and abide in the king:\" [**] but whether as rightful heir, or  only as present possessor, was not determined.         * Bacon, p. 581.         ** Bacon, p. 581.    In like manner, Henry was contented that the succession should be  secured to the heirs of his body; but he pretended not, in case of their  failure, to exclude the house of York or to give the preference to that  of Lancaster: he left that great point ambiguous for the present, and  trusted that, if it should ever become requisite to "]]]
