This paper was prepared with special reference to the wants of the  collector, being printed on bond paper and bound in flexible cloth. It  was widely distributed and, like that of Mr. Gibbs, resulted in the  collection of valuable linguistic material.    In 1879 Congress consolidated the various surveys, including that of the  Rocky Mountain Region, into the United States Geological Survey, but  made provision for continuing the publication of the Contributions to  North American Ethnology under the direction of the Secretary of the  Smithsonian Institution, and directed that the ethnologic material in  Major Powell's hands be turned over to the Institution. Thus the Bureau  of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution was organized, and Major  Powell was placed at its head.    By this time the growing interest manifested in the study of North  American linguistics rendered necessary the preparation of a new edition  of the Introduction. In the words of the author:    \"The progress made by various students, and the studies made by the  author, alike require that a new edition be prepared to meet the more  advanced wants and to embody the results of wider studies. Under these  circumstances the present edition is published. It does not purport to  be a philosophic treatment of the subject of language; it is not a  comparative grammar of Indian tongues; it is simply a series of  explanations of certain characteristics almost universally found by  students of Indian languages--the explanations being of such a  character as experience has shown would best meet the wants of persons  practically at work in the field on languages with which they are  unfamiliar. The book is a body of directions for collectors.    \"It is believed that the system of schedules, followed _seriatim_, will  lead the student in a proper way to the collection of linguistic  materials; that the explanations given will assist him in overcoming the  difficulties which he is sure to encounter; and that the materials when  collected will constitute valuable contributions to philology. It has  been the effort of the author to connect the study of language with the  study of other branches of anthropology, for a language is best  understood when the habits, customs, institutions, philosophy--the  subject-matter of thought embodied in the language--are best known. The  student of language should be a student of the people who speak the  language; and to this end the book has been prepared, with many hints  and suggestions relating to other branches of anthropology.\"    The title of this publication is as follows:    Smithsonian Institution--Bureau of Ethnology | J.W.

Often nippers or scissors are used as tongs.    Ordinary scissors, purchased from the whites, are used for cutting:  their metal after it is wrought into thin plates. The metal saw and  metal shears do not seem as yet to have been imported for their benefit.  Some of the more poorly provided smiths use their scissors also for  tongs, regardless or ignorant of consequences, and when the shears lose  their temper and become loose-jointed and blunt, the efforts of the  Indian to cut a rather thick plate of silver are curious to see. Often,  then, one or two bystanders are called to hold the plate in a horizontal  position, and perhaps another will be asked to hold the points of the  scissors to keep them from spreading. Scissors are sometimes used as  dividers, by being spread to the desired distance and held in position  by being grasped in the hand. By this means I have seen them attempt to  find centers, but not to describe circles. It is probable that had they  trusted to the eye they might have found their centers as well.    Their iron pliers, hammers, and files they purchase from the whites.  Pliers, both flat-pointed and round-pointed, are used as with us. Of  files they usually employ only small sizes, and the varieties they  prefer are the flat, triangular, and rat-tail. Files are used not only  for their legitimate purposes, as with us, but the shanks serve for  punches and the points for gravers, with which figures are engraved on  silver.    The Indians usually make their own cold-chisels. These are not used  where the scissors and file can be conveniently and economically  employed. The re-entrant rectangles on the bracelet represented in Fig.  4, Pl. XIX, were cut with a cold-chisel and finished with a file.    Awls are used to mark figures on the silver. Often they cut out of paper  a pattern, which they lay on the silver, tracing the outline with an  awl. These tools are sometimes purchased and sometimes made by the  Indians. I have seen one made from a broken knife which had been picked  up around the fort. The blade had been ground down to a point.    Metallic hemispheres for beads and buttons are made in a concave matrix  by means of a round-pointed bolt which I will call a die. These tools  are always made by the Indians. On one bar of iron there may be many  matrices of different sizes, only one die fitting the smallest  concavity, is required to work the metal in all. In the picture of the  smithy (Pl. XVII, in the right lower corner beside the tin-plate), a  piece of an old horse-shoe may be seen in which a few matrices have been  worked, and, beside it, the die used in connection with the matrices.    [Illustration: PL. XVIII. CRUCIBLE, AND SANDSTONE MOLDS FOR  SHAPING SILVER OBJECTS.]    [Illustration: PL. XVII. WORKSHOP OF NAVAJO SILVERSMITH.]    A little instrument employed in levelling the edges of the metallic  hemispheres, is rude but effective. In one end of a cylinder of wood,  about three or four inches long, is cut a small roundish cavity of such  a size that it will hold the hemisphere tightly, but allow the uneven  edges to project. The hemisphere is placed in this, and then rubbed on a  flat piece of sandstone until the edges are worn level with the base of  the wooden cylinder. The uses of the basin and the wooden stake are  described further on.    Their method of preparing charcoal is much more expeditious than that  usually employed by our charcoal-burners, but more wasteful; wood,  however, need not yet be economized on the juniper-covered _mesas_ of  New Mexico. They build a large fire of dry juniper, and when it has  ceased to flame and is reduced to a mass of glowing coals, they smother  it well with earth and leave it to cool. If the fire is kindled at  sunset, the charcoal is ready for use next morning.    The smith makes his own blow-pipe, out of brass, usually by beating a  piece of thick brass wire into a flat strip, and then bending this into  a tube. The pipe is about a foot long, slightly tapering and curved at  one end; there is no arrangement for retaining the moisture proceeding  from the mouth. These Indians do not understand our method of making an  air chamber of the mouth; they blow with undistended cheeks, hence the  current of air directed on the flame is intermitting. The flame used in  soldering with the blow-pipe is derived from a thick braid of cotton  rags soaked in mutton suet or other grease. Their borax is purchased  from the whites, and from the same source is derived the fine wire with  which they bind together the parts to be soldered. I have been told by  reliable persons that it is not many years since the Navajos employed a  flux mined by themselves in their own country; but, finding the pure  borax introduced by the traders to be much better, they gradually  abandoned the use of the former substance.    For polishing, they have sand-paper and emery-paper purchased from the  whites; but as these are expensive, they are usually required only for  the finishing touches, the first part of the work being done with  powdered sandstone, sand, or ashes, all of which are used with or  without water. At certain stages in the progress of the work, some  articles are rubbed on a piece of sandstone to reduce the surfaces to  smoothness; but the stone, in this instance, is more a substitute for  the file than for the sand-paper. Perhaps I should say that the file is  a substitute for the stone, for there is little doubt that stone, sand,  and ashes preceded file and paper in the shop of the Indian smith.    For blanching the silver, when the forging is done, they use a mineral  substance found in various parts of their country, which, I am informed  by Mr. Taylor, of the Smithsonian Institution, is a \"hydrous sulphate of  alumina,\" called almogen. This they dissolve in water, in a metal basin,  with the addition, sometimes, of salt. The silver, being first slightly  heated in the forge, is boiled in this solution and in a short time  becomes very white.    The processes of the Navajo silversmith may be best understood from  descriptions of the ways in which he makes some of his silver ornament.  I once engaged two of the best workmen in the tribe to come to Fort  Wingate and work under my observation for a week. They put up their  forge in a small outbuilding at night, and early next morning they were  at work. Their labor was almost all performed while they were sitting or  crouching on the ground in very constrained positions; yet I never saw  men who worked harder or more steadily. They often labored from twelve  to fifteen hours a day, eating their meals with dispatch and returning  to their toil the moment they had done. Occasionally they stopped to  roll a cigarette or consult about their work, but they lost very few  moments in this way. They worked by the job and their prices were such  that they earned about two dollars a day each.    The first thing they made was a powder charger with a handle in the  shape of a dart (Fig. 2, Pl. XIX). Having cut in sandstone rock (Fig. 2,  Pl. XVIII) the necessary grooves for molds and greased the same, they  melted two Mexican dollars--one for the bowl or receptacle, and one for  the handle--and poured each one into its appropriate mold. Then each  smith went to work on a separate part; but they helped one another when  necessary. The ingot cast for the receptacle was beaten into a plate  (triangular in shape, with obtuse corners), of a size which the smith  guessed would be large enough for his purpose. Before the process of  bending was quite completed the margins that were to form the seam were  straightened by clipping and filing so as to assume a pretty accurate  contact, and when the bending was done, a small gap still left in the  seam was filled with a shred of silver beaten in. The cone, at this  stage, being indented and irregular, the workman thrust into it a  conical stake or mandrel, which he had formed carefully out of hard  wood, and with gentle taps of the hammer soon made the cone even and  shapely. Next, withdrawing the stake, he laid on the seam a mixture of  borax and minute clippings of silver moistened with saliva, put the  article into the fire, seam up, blew with the bellows until the silver  was at a dull red-heat, and then applied the blow-pipe and flame until  the soldering was completed. In the meantime the other smith had, with  hammer and file, wrought the handle until it was sufficiently formed to  be joined to the receptacle, the base of the handle being filed down for  a length of about a quarter of an inch so that it would fit tightly into  the orifice at the apex of the receptacle. The two parts were then  adjusted and bound firmly together with a fine wire passing in various  directions, over the base of the cone, across the protuberances on the  dart-shaped handle, and around both. This done, the parts were soldered  together in the manner already described, the ring by which it is  suspended was fastened on, the edge of the receptacle was clipped and  filed, and the whole was brought into good shape with file, sand,  emery-paper, &c.    [Illustration: PL. XIX. OBJECTS IN SILVER.]    The chasing was the next process. To make the round indentations on  the handle, one smith held the article on the anvil while the other  applied the point of the shank of a file--previously rounded--and struck  the file with a hammer. The other figures were made with the sharpened  point of a file, pushed forward with a zigzag motion of the hand. When  the chasing was done the silver was blanched by the process before  referred to, being occasionally taken from the boiling solution of  almogen to be rubbed with ashes and sand. For about five hours both of  the smiths worked together on this powder-charger; subsequently, for  about three hours' more, there was only one man engaged on it; so that,  in all, thirteen hours labor was spent in constructing it. Of this time,  about "]]]
