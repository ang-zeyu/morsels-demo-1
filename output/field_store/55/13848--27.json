Therefore I again implore all Christians, especially pastors and  preachers, not to be doctors too soon, and imagine that they know  everything (for imagination and cloth unshrunk [and false weights] fall  far short of the measure), but that they daily exercise themselves well  in these studies and constantly treat them; moreover, that they guard  with all care and diligence against the poisonous infection of such  security and vain imagination, but steadily keep on reading, teaching,  learning, pondering, and meditating, and do not cease until they have  made a test and are sure that they have taught the devil to death and  have become more learned than God Himself and all His saints.    If they manifest such diligence, then I will promise them, and they  shall also perceive, what fruit they will obtain, and what excellent  men God will make of them, so that in due time they themselves will  acknowledge that the longer and the more they study the Catechism, the  less they know of it, and the more they find yet to learn; and then  only, as hungry and thirsty ones, will they truly relish that which now  they cannot endure because of great abundance and satiety. To this end  may God grant His grace! Amen.       SHORT PREFACE OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER.      This sermon is designed and undertaken that it might be an instruction  for children and the simple-minded. Hence of old it was called in Greek  catechism, i.e., instruction for children, what every Christian must  needs know, so that he who does not know this could not be numbered  with the Christians nor be admitted to any Sacrament, just as a  mechanic who does not understand the rules and customs of his trade is  expelled and considered incapable. Therefore we must have the young  learn the parts which belong to the Catechism or instruction for  children well and fluently and diligently exercise themselves in them  and keep them occupied with them.    Therefore it is the duty of every father of a family to question and  examine his children and servants at least once a week and to  ascertain what they know of it, or are learning and, if they do not  know it, to keep them faithfully at it. For I well remember the time,  indeed, even now it is a daily occurrence that one finds rude, old  persons who knew nothing and still know nothing of these things, and  who, nevertheless, go to Baptism and the Lord's Supper, and use  everything belonging to Christians, notwithstanding that those who come  to the Lord's Supper ought to know more and have a fuller understanding  of all Christian doctrine than children and new scholars. However, for  the common people we are satisfied with the three parts, which have  remained in Christendom from of old, though little of it has been  taught and treated correctly until both young and old who are called  and wish to be Christians, are well trained in them and familiar with  them. These are the following:      First.    THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF GOD.      1. Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.    2. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord, thy God, in vain [for the  Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain].    3. Thou shalt sanctify the holy-day. [Remember the Sabbath-day to keep  it holy.]    4. Thou shalt honor thy father and mother [that thou mayest live long  upon the earth].    5. Thou shalt not kill.    6. Thou shalt not commit adultery.    7. Thou shalt not steal.    8. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.    9. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.    10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor  his maidservant, nor his cattle [ox, nor his ass], nor anything that is  his.    Secondly.    THE CHIEF ARTICLES OF OUR FAITH.      1. I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.    2. And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by  the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate,  was crucified, dead and buried; He descended into hell; the third day  He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, and sitteth on  the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to  judge the quick and the dead.    3. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy Christian Church, the  communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the  body, and the life everlasting. Amen.      Thirdly.    THE PRAYER, OR \"OUR FATHER,\" WHICH CHRIST TAUGHT    Our Father who art in heaven.    1. Hallowed be Thy name.    2. Thy kingdom come.    3. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.    4. Give us this day our daily bread.    5. And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass  against us.    6. And lead us not into temptation.    7. But deliver us from evil. [For Thine is the kingdom and the power  and the glory, forever and ever.] Amen.      These are the most necessary parts which one should first learn to  repeat word for word and which our children should be accustomed to  recite daily when they arise in the morning when they sit down to their  meals, and when they retire at night; and until they repeat them, they  should be given neither food nor drink. Likewise every head of a  household is obliged to do the same with respect to his domestics,  ma-servants and maid-servants and not to keep them in his house if they  do not know these things and are unwilling to learn them. For a person  who is so rude and unruly as to be unwilling to learn these things is  not to be tolerated, for in these three parts everything that we have  in the Scriptures is comprehended in short, pain, and simple terms. For  the holy Fathers or apostles (whoever they were) have thus embraced in  a summary the doctrine, life, wisdom, and art of Christians, of which  they speak and treat, and with which they are occupied. Now, when these  three arts are apprehended, it behooves a person also to know what to  say concerning our Sacraments, which Christ Himself instituted, Baptism  and the holy body and blood of Christ, namely, the text which Matthew  [28, 19 ff.] and Mark [16, 15 f.] record at the close of their Gospels  when Christ said farewell to His disciples and sent them forth.    OF BAPTISM.    Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,  and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. He that believeth and is  baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. So  much is sufficient for a simple person to know from the Scriptures  concerning Baptism. In like manner, also, concerning the other  Sacrament in short, simple words, namely the text of St. Paul [1 Cor.  11, 23 f.].    OF THE SACRAMENT    Our Lord Jesus Christ, the same night in which He was betrayed, took  bread; and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and gave it to His  disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body, which is given for you:  this do in remembrance of Me.    After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped, gave  thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; this cup is  the new testament in My blood, which is shed for you for the remission  of sins: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of Me.    Thus, ye would have, in all, five parts of the entire Christian  doctrine which should be constantly treated and required [of children]  and heard recited word for word. For you must not rely upon it that the  young people will learn and retain these things from the sermon alone.  When these parts have been well learned, you may, as a supplement and  to fortify them. lay before them also some psalms or hymns, which have  been composed on these parts, and thus lead the young into the  Scriptures, and make daily progress therein.    However, it is not enough for them to comprehend and recite these  parts according to the words only, but the young people should also be  made to attend the preaching, especially during the time which is  devoted to the Catechism, that they may hear it explained and may learn  to understand what every part contains, so as to be able to recite it  as they have heard it, and, when asked, may give a correct answer, so  that the preaching may not be without profit and fruit. For the reason  why we exercise such diligence in preaching the Catechism so often is  that it may be inculcated on our youth, not in a high and subtle  manner, but briefly and with the greatest simplicity, so as to enter  the mind readily and be fixed in the memory. Therefore we shall now  take up the above mentioned articles one by one and in the plainest  manner possible say about them as much as is necessary.         Part First. The Ten Commandments.      The First Commandment.      Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.      That is: Thou shalt have [and worship] Me alone as thy God. What is the  force of this, and how is it to be understood? What does it mean to  have a god? or, what is God? Answer: A god means that from which we are  to expect all good and to which we are to take refuge in all distress,  so that to have a God is nothing else than to trust and believe Him  from the [whole] heart; as I have often said that the confidence and  faith of the heart alone make both God and an idol. If your faith and  trust be right, then is your god also true; and, on the other hand, if  your trust be false and wrong, then you have not the true God; for  these two belong together faith and God. That now, I say, upon which  you set your heart and put your trust is properly your god.    Therefore it is the intent of this commandment to require true faith  and trust of the heart which settles upon the only true God and clings  to Him alone. That is as much as to say: \"See to it that you let Me  alone be your God, and never seek "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17221"],[0,"History of the Plague in London (#2)"],[1,"the art of \"lying like truth.\" When, therefore, the  actual and extraordinary adventures of Alexander Selkirk came under his  notice, nothing was more natural and more profitable for Defoe than to  seize upon this material, and work it up, just as he worked up the lives  of Jack Sheppard the highwayman, and of Avery the king of the pirates.  It is interesting to notice also that the date of publication of  \"Robinson Crusoe\" (1719) corresponds with a time at which Defoe was  playing the desperate and dangerous game of a political spy. A single  false move might bring him a stab in the dark, or might land him in the  hulks for transportation to some tropical island, where he might have  abundant need for the exercise of those mental resources that interest  us so much in Crusoe. The secret of Defoe's life at this time was known  only to himself and to the minister that paid him. He was almost as much  alone in London as was Crusoe on his desert island.    The success which Defoe scored in \"Robinson Crusoe\" he never repeated.  His entire lack of artistic conscience is shown by his adding a dull  second part to \"Robinson Crusoe,\" and a duller series of serious  reflections such as might have passed through Crusoe's mind during his  island captivity. Of even the best of Defoe's other novels,--\"Moll  Flanders,\" \"Roxana,\" \"Captain Singleton,\"--the writer must confess that  his judgment coincides with that of Mr. Leslie Stephen, who finds two  thirds of them \"deadly dull,\" and the treatment such as \"cannot raise  [the story] above a very moderate level.\"[3]    The closing scenes of Defoe's life were not cheerful. He appears to have  lost most of the fortune he acquired from his numerous writings and  scarcely less numerous speculations. For the two years immediately  preceding his death, he lived in concealment away from his home, though  why he fled, and from what danger, is not definitely known. He died in a  lodging in Ropemaker's Alley, Moorfields, on April 26, 1731.    The only description we have of Defoe's personal appearance is an  advertisement published in 1703, when he was in hiding to avoid arrest  for his \"Shortest Way with the Dissenters:\"--    \"He is a middle-aged, spare man, about forty years old, of a brown  complexion, and dark-brown colored hair, but wears a wig; a hooked nose,  a sharp chin, gray eyes, and a large mole near his mouth.\"    In the years 1720-21 the plague, which had not visited Western Europe  for fifty-five years, broke out with great violence in Marseilles. About  fifty thousand people died of the disease in that city, and great alarm  was felt in London lest the infection should reach England. Here was a  journalistic chance that so experienced a newspaper man as Defoe could  not let slip. Accordingly, on the 17th of March, 1722, appeared his  \"Journal of the Plague Year: Being Observations or Memorials of the most  Remarkable Occurrences, as well Publick as Private, which happened in  London during the Last Great Visitation in 1665. Written by a Citizen  who continued all the while in London. Never made public before.\" The  story is told with such an air of veracity, the little circumstantial  details are introduced with such apparent artlessness, the grotesque  incidents are described with such animation, (and relish!) the horror  borne in upon the mind of the narrator is so apparently genuine, that we  can easily understand how almost everybody not in the secret of the  authorship believed he had here an authentic \"Journal,\" written by one  who had actually beheld the scenes he describes. Indeed, we know that  twenty-three years after the \"Journal\" was published, this impression  still prevailed; for Defoe is gravely quoted as an authority in \"A  Discourse on the Plague; by Richard Mead, Fellow of the College of  Physicians and of the Royal Society, and Physician to his Majesty. 9th  Edition. London, 1744.\" Though Defoe, like his admiring critic Mr.  Saintsbury, had but small sense of humor, even he must have felt tickled  in his grave at this ponderous scientific tribute to his skill in the  art of realistic description.    If we inquire further into the secret of Defoe's success in the \"History  of the Plague,\" we shall find that it consists largely in his vision,  or power of seeing clearly and accurately what he describes, before he  attempts to put this description on paper. As Defoe was but four years  old at the time of the Great Plague, his personal recollection of its  effects must have been of the dimmest; but during the years of childhood  (the most imaginative of life) he must often have conversed with persons  who had been through the plague, possibly with those who had recovered  from it themselves. He must often have visited localities ravaged by the  plague, and spared by the Great Fire of 1666; he must often have gazed  in childish horror at those awful mounds beneath which hundreds of human  bodies lay huddled together,--rich and poor, high and low, scoundrel and  saint,--sharing one common bed at last. His retentive memory must have  stored away at least the outline of those hideous images, so effectively  recombined many years later by means of his powerful though limited  imagination.           *       *       *       *       *    Defoe had the ability to become a good scholar, and to acquire the  elements of a good English style; but it is certain he never did. He  never had time, or rather he never took time, preferring invariably  quantity to quality. What work of his has survived till to-day is read,  not for its style, but in spite of its style. His syntax is loose and  unscholarly; his vocabulary is copious, but often inaccurate; many of  his sentences ramble on interminably, lacking unity, precision, and  balance. Figures of speech he seldom abuses because he seldom uses; his  imagination, as noticed before, being extremely limited in range. That  Defoe, in spite of these defects, should succeed in interesting us in  his \"Plague,\" is a remarkable tribute to his peculiar ability as  described in the preceding paragraph.    In the course of the Notes, the editor has indicated such corrections  as are necessary to prevent the student from thinking that in reading  Defoe he is drinking from a \"well of English undefiled.\" The art of  writing an English prose at once scholarly, clear-cut, and vigorous, was  well understood by Defoe's great contemporaries, Dryden, Swift, and  Congreve; it does not seem to have occurred to Defoe that he could learn  anything from their practice. He has his reward. \"Robinson Crusoe\" may  continue to hold the child and the kitchen wench; but the \"Essay on  Dramatic Poesy,\" \"The Battle of the Books,\" and \"Love for Love,\" are for  the men and women of culture.           *       *       *       *       *    The standard Life of Defoe is by William Lee (London, J.C. Hotten,  1869). William Minto, in the \"English Men of Letters Series,\" has an  excellent short biography of Defoe. For criticism, the only good  estimate I am acquainted with is by Leslie Stephen, in \"Hours in a  Library, First Series.\" The nature of the article on Defoe in the  \"Britannica\" may be indicated by noticing that the writer (Saintsbury)  seriously compares Defoe with Carlyle as a descriptive writer. It would  be consoling to think that this is intended as a joke.    Those who wish to know more about the plague than Defoe tells them  should consult Besant's \"London,\" pp. 376-394 (New York, Harpers).  Besant refers to two pamphlets, \"The Wonderful Year\" and \"Vox  Civitatis,\" which he thinks Defoe must have used in writing his book.

It was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I, among  the rest of my neighbors, heard in ordinary discourse that the  plague was returned again in Holland; for it had been very  violent there, and particularly at Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in  the year 1663, whither, they say, it was brought (some said from  Italy, others from the Levant) among some goods which were  brought home by their Turkey fleet; others said it was brought  from Candia; others, from Cyprus. It mattered not from whence  it came; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.[4]    We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days, to  spread rumors and reports of things, and to improve them by the  invention of men, as I have lived to see practiced since. But  such things as those were gathered from the letters of merchants  and others who corresponded abroad, and from them was handed  about by word of mouth only; so that things did not spread instantly  over the whole nation, as they do now. But it seems that  the government had a true account of it, and several counsels[5]  were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all was  kept very private. Hence it was that this rumor died off again;  and people began to forget it, as a thing we were very little concerned  in and that we hoped was not true, till the latter end of  November or the beginning of December, 1664, when two men,  said to be Frenchmen, died of the plague in Longacre, or rather  at the upper end of Drury Lane.[6] The family they were in endeavored  to conceal it as much as possible; but, as it had gotten  some vent in the discourse of the neighborhood, the secretaries  of state[7] got knowledge of it. And concerning themselves to  inquire about it, in order to be certain of the truth, two physicians  and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house, and make inspection.  This they did, and finding evident tokens[8] of the sickness  upon both the bodies that were dead, they gave their opinions  publicly that they died of the plague. Whereupon it was given  in to"]]]
