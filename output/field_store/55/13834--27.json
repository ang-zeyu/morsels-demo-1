Illness.      [The new year opened badly enough, and from letters he wrote  subsequently concerning the illness which now attacked him, we gather  that it left evils behind, from which he never quite recovered. The  following entries were made after he regained sufficient strength, but  we see how short they necessarily were, and what labour it was to make  the jottings which relate to his progress towards the western shore of  Lake Tanganyika. He was not able at any time during this seizure to  continue the minute maps of the country in his pocket-books, which for  the first time fail here.]    _1st January, 1869._--I have been wet times without number, but the  wetting of yesterday was once too often: I felt very ill, but fearing  that the Lofuko might flood, I resolved to cross it. Cold up to the  waist, which made me worse, but I went on for 2-1/2 hours E.    _3rd January, 1869._--I marched one hour, but found I was too ill to go  further. Moving is always good in fever; now I had a pain in the chest,  and rust of iron sputa: my lungs, my strongest part, were thus affected.  We crossed a rill and built sheds, but I lost count of the days of the  week and month after this. Very ill all over.    _About 7th January, 1869._--Cannot walk: Pneumonia of right lung, and I  cough all day and all night: sputa rust of iron and bloody: distressing  weakness. Ideas flow through the mind with great rapidity and vividness,  in groups of twos and threes: if I look at any piece of wood, the bark  seems covered over with figures and faces of men, and they remain,  though I look away and turn to the same spot again. I saw myself lying  dead in the way to Ujiji, and all the letters I expected there useless.  When I think of my children and friends, the lines ring through my head  perpetually:        \"I shall look into your faces,        And listen to what you say,      And be often very near you        When you think I'm far away.\"    Mohamad Bogharib came up, and I have got a cupper, who cupped my chest.    _8th and 9th January, 1869._--Mohamad Bogharib offered to carry me. I am  so weak I can scarcely speak. We are in Marungu proper now--a pretty but  steeply-undulating country. This is the first time in my life I have  been carried in illness, but I cannot raise myself to the sitting  posture. No food except a little gruel. Great distress in coughing all  night long; feet swelled and sore. I am carried four hours each day on a  kitanda or frame, like a cot; carried eight hours one day. Then sleep in  a deep ravine. Next day six hours, over volcanic tufa; very rough. We  seem near the brim of Tanganyika. Sixteen days of illness. May be 23rd  of January; it is 5th of lunar month. Country very undulating; it is  perpetually up and down. Soil red, and rich knolls of every size and  form. Trees few. Erythrinas abound; so do elephants. Carried eight hours  yesterday to a chief's village. Small sharp thorns hurt the men's feet,  and so does the roughness of the ground. Though there is so much slope,  water does not run quickly off Marungu. A compact mountain-range flanks  the undulating country through which we passed, and may stop the water  flowing. Mohamad Bogharib is very kind to me in my extreme weakness; but  carriage is painful; head down and feet up alternates with feet down and  head up; jolted up and down and sideways--changing shoulders involves a  toss from one side to the other of the kitanda. The sun is vertical,  blistering any part of the skin exposed, and I try to shelter my face  and head as well as I can with a bunch of leaves, but it is dreadfully  fatiguing in my weakness.    I had a severe relapse after a very hot day. Mohamad gave me medicines;  one was a sharp purgative, the others intended for the cure of the  cough.    _14th February, 1869._--Arrived at Tanganyika. Parra is the name of the  land at the confluence of the River Lofuko: Syde bin Habib had two or  three large canoes at this place, our beads were nearly done, so I sent  to Syde to say that all the Arabs had served me except himself. Thani  bin Suellim by his letter was anxious to send a canoe as soon as I  reached the Lake, and the only service I wanted of Syde was to inform  Thani, by one of his canoes, that I was here very ill, and if I did not  get to Ujiji to get proper food and medicine I should die. Thani would  send a canoe as soon as he knew of my arrival I was sure: he replied  that he too would serve me: and sent some flour and two fowls: he would  come in two days and see what he could do as to canoes.    _15th February, 1869._--The cough and chest pain diminished, and I feel  thankful; my body is greatly emaciated. Syde came to-day, and is  favourable to sending me up to Ujiji. Thanks to the Great Father in  Heaven.    _24th February, 1869._--We had remarkably little rain these two months.    _25th February, 1869._--I extracted twenty _Funyes_, an insect like a  maggot, whose eggs had been inserted on my having been put into an old  house infested by them; as they enlarge they stir about and impart a  stinging sensation; if disturbed, the head is drawn in a little. When a  poultice is put on they seem obliged to come out possibly from want of  air: they can be pressed out, but the large pimple in which they live is  painful; they were chiefly in my limbs.    _26th February, 1869._--Embark, and sleep at Katonga after seven hours'  paddling.    _27th February, 1869._--Went 1-3/4 hour to Bondo or Thembwe to buy food.  Shore very rough, like shores near Caprera, but here all is covered with  vegetation. We were to cross to Kabogo, a large mass of mountains on the  eastern side, but the wind was too high.    _28th February, 1869._--Syde sent food back to his slaves.    _2nd March, 1869._--Waves still high, so we got off only on _3rd_ at 1h.  30m. A.M. 6-1/2 hours, and came to M. Bogharib, who cooked bountifully.    _6th March, 1869._--5 P.M. Off to Toloka Bay--three hours; left at 6  A.M., and came, in four hours, to Uguha, which is on the west side of  Tanganyika.    _7th March, 1869._--Left at 6 P.M., and went on till two canoes ran on  rocks in the way to Kasanga islet. Rounded a point of land, and made for  Kasanga with a storm in our teeth; fourteen hours in all. We were  received by a young Arab Muscat, who dined us sumptuously at noon: there  are seventeen islets in the Kasanga group.    _8th March, 1869._--On Kasanga islet. Cochin-China fowls[1] and Muscovy  ducks appear, and plenty of a small milkless breed of goats. Tanganyika  has many deep bays running in four or five miles; they are choked up  with aquatic vegetation, through which canoes can scarcely be propelled.  When the bay has a small rivulet at its head, the water in the bay is  decidedly brackish, though the rivulet be fresh, it made the Zanzibar  people remark on the Lake water, \"It is like that we get near the  sea-shore--a little salt;\" but as soon as we get out of the shut-in bay  or lagoon into the Lake proper the water is quite sweet, and shows that  a current flows through the middle of the Lake lengthways.    Patience was never more needed than now: I am near Ujiji, but the slaves  who paddle are tired, and no wonder; they keep up a roaring song all  through their work, night and day. I expect to get medicine, food, and  milk at Ujiji, but dawdle and do nothing. I have a good appetite, and  sleep well; these are the favourable symptoms; but am dreadfully thin,  bowels irregular, and I have no medicine. Sputa increases; hope to hold  out to Ujiji. Cough worse. Hope to go to-morrow.    _9th March, 1869._--The Whydah birds have at present light breasts and  dark necks. Zahor is the name of our young Arab host.    _11th March, 1869._--Go over to Kibize islet, 1-1/2 hour from Kasanga."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1703"],[0,"Dead Men Tell No Tales (#2)"],[1," break of the poop we watch the  vivid shifting patch of deck that each lights up on its way. The stars  are very sharp in the vast violet dome above our masts; they shimmer on  the sea; and our trucks describe minute orbits among the stars, for the  trades have yet to fail us, and every inch of canvas has its fill of the  gentle steady wind. It is a heavenly night. The peace of God broods upon  His waters. No jarring note offends the ear. In the forecastle a voice  is humming a song of Eva Denison's that has caught the fancy of the men;  the young girl who sang it so sweetly not twenty minutes since who  sang it again and again to please the crew she alone is at war with our  little world she alone would head a mutiny if she could.    \"I hate the captain!\" she says again.    \"My dear Miss Denison!\" I begin; for she has always been severe upon our  bluff old man, and it is not the spirit of contrariety alone which makes  me invariably take his part. Coarse he may be, and not one whom the  owners would have chosen to command the Lady Jermyn; a good seaman none  the less, who brought us round the Horn in foul weather without losing  stitch or stick. I think of the ruddy ruffian in his dripping oilskins,  on deck day and night for our sakes, and once more I must needs take his  part; but Miss Denison stops me before I can get out another word.    \"I am not dear, and I'm not yours,\" she cries. \"I'm only a  school-girl--you have all but told me so before to-day! If I were a  man--if I were you--I should tell Captain Harris what I thought of him!\"    \"Why? What has he done now?\"    \"Now? You know how rude he was to poor Mr. Ready this very afternoon!\"    It was true. He had been very rude indeed. But Ready also had been at  fault. It may be that I was always inclined to take an opposite view,  but I felt bound to point this out, and at any cost.    \"You mean when Ready asked him if we were out of our course? I must  say I thought it was a silly question to put. It was the same the other  evening about the cargo. If the skipper says we're in ballast why not  believe him? Why repeat steerage gossip, about mysterious cargoes, at  the cuddy table? Captains are always touchy about that sort of thing. I  wasn't surprised at his letting out.\"    My poor love stares at me in the starlight. Her great eyes flash their  scorn. Then she gives a little smile--and then a little nod--more  scornful than all the rest.    \"You never are surprised, are you, Mr. Cole?\" says she. \"You were not  surprised when the wretch used horrible language in front of me! You  were not surprised when it was a--dying man--whom he abused!\"    I try to soothe her. I agree heartily with her disgust at the epithets  employed in her hearing, and towards an invalid, by the irate skipper.  But I ask her to make allowances for a rough, uneducated man, rather  clumsily touched upon his tender spot. I shall conciliate her presently;  the divine pout (so childish it was!) is fading from her lips; the  starlight is on the tulle and lace and roses of her pretty evening  dress, with its festooned skirts and obsolete flounces; and I am  watching her, ay, and worshipping her, though I do not know it yet. And  as we stand there comes another snatch from the forecastle:--           \"What will you do, love, when I am going.              With white sail flowing,              The seas beyond?          What will you do, love--\"    \"They may make the most of that song,\" says Miss Denison grimly; \"it's  the last they'll have from me. Get up as many more concerts as you like.  I won't sing at another unless it's in the fo'c'sle. I'll sing to the  men, but not to Captain Harris. He didn't put in an appearance tonight.  He shall not have another chance of insulting me.\"    Was it her vanity that was wounded after all? \"You forget,\" said I,  \"that you would not answer when he addressed you at dinner.\"    \"I should think I wouldn't, after the way he spoke to Mr. Ready; and he  too agitated to come to table, poor fellow!\"    \"Still, the captain felt the open slight.\"    \"Then he shouldn't have used such language in front of me.\"    \"Your father felt it, too, Miss Denison.\"    I hear nothing plainer than her low but quick reply:    \"Mr. Cole, my father has been dead many; many years; he died before I  can remember. That man only married my poor mother. He sympathizes  with Captain Harris--against me; no father would do that. Look at them  together now! And you take his side, too; oh! I have no patience with  any of you--except poor Mr. Ready in his berth.\"    \"But you are not going.\"    \"Indeed I am. I am tired of you all.\"    And she was gone with angry tears for which I blamed myself as I fell to  pacing the weather side of the poop--and so often afterwards! So often,  and with such unavailing bitterness!    Senhor Santos and the captain were in conversation by the weather rail.  I fancied poor old Harris eyed me with suspicion, and I wished he had  better cause. The Portuguese, however, saluted me with his customary  courtesy, and I thought there was a grave twinkle in his steady eye.    \"Are you in deesgrace also, friend Cole?\" he inquired in his all but  perfect English.    \"More or less,\" said I ruefully.    He gave the shrug of his country--that delicate gesture which is done  almost entirely with the back--a subtlety beyond the power of British  shoulders.    \"The senhora is both weelful and pivish,\" said he, mixing the two vowels  which (with the aspirate) were his only trouble with our tongue. \"It is  great grif to me to see her growing so unlike her sainted mother!\"    He sighed, and I saw his delicate fingers forsake the cigarette they  were rolling to make the sacred sign upon his breast. He was always  smoking one cigarette and making another; as he lit the new one the glow  fell upon a strange pin that he wore, a pin with a tiny crucifix inlaid  in mosaic. So the religious cast of Senhor Santos was brought twice home  to me in the same moment, though, to be sure, I had often been struck  by it before. And it depressed me to think that so sweet a child as Eva  Denison should have spoken harshly of so good a man as her step-father,  simply because he had breadth enough to sympathize with a coarse old  salt like Captain Harris.    I turned in, however, and I cannot say the matter kept me awake in the  separate state-room which was one luxury of our empty saloon. Alas? I  was a heavy sleeper then.          CHAPTER II. THE MYSTERIOUS CARGO      \"Wake up, Cole! The ship's on fire!\"    It was young Ready's hollow voice, as cool, however, as though he were  telling me I was late for breakfast. I started up and sought him wildly  in the darkness.    \"You're joking,\" was my first thought and utterance; for now he was  lighting my candle, and blowing out the match with a care that seemed in  itself a contradiction.    \"I wish I were,\" he answered. \"Listen to that!\"    He pointed to my cabin ceiling; it quivered and creaked; and all at once  I was as a deaf man healed.    One gets inured to noise at sea, but to this day it passes me how even I  could have slept an instant in the abnormal din which I now heard raging  above my head. Sea-boots stamped; bare feet pattered; men bawled; women  shrieked; shouts of terror drowned the roar of command.    \"Have we long to last?\" I asked, as I leaped for my clothes.    \"Long enough for you to dress comfortably. Steady, old man! It's only  just been discovered; they may get it under. The panic's the worst part  at present, and we're out of that.\"    But was Eva Denison? Breathlessly I put the question; his answer was  reassuring. Miss Denison was with her step-father on the poop. \"And both  of 'em as cool as cucumbers,\" added Ready.    They could not have been cooler than this young man, with death at the  bottom of his bright and sunken eyes. He was of the type which is all  muscle and no constitution; athletes one year, dead men the next; but  until this moment the athlete had been to me a mere and incredible  tradition. In the afternoon I had seen his lean knees totter under the  captain's fire. Now, at midnight--the exact time by my watch--it was as  if his shrunken limbs had expanded in his clothes; he seemed hardly to  know his own flushed face, as he caught sight of it in my mirror.    \"By Jove!\" said he, \"this has put me in a fine old fever; but I don't  know when I felt in better fettle. If only they get it under! I've not  looked like this all the voyage.\"    And he admired himself while I dressed in hot haste: a fine young  fellow; not at all the natural egotist, but cast for death by the  doctors, and keenly incredulous in his bag of skin. It revived one's  confidence to hear him talk. But he forgot himself in an instant, and  gave me a lead through the saloon with a boyish eagerness that made me  actually suspicious as I ran. We were nearing the Line. I recalled the  excesses of my last crossing, and I prepared for some vast hoax at the  last moment. It was only when we plunged upon the crowded quarter-deck,  and my own eyes read lust of life and dread of death in the starting  eyes of others, that such lust and such dread consumed me in my turn, so  that my veins seemed filled with fire and ice.    To be fair to those others, I think that the first wild panic was  subsiding even then; at least there was a lull, and even a reaction in  the right direction on the part of the males in the second class and  steerage. A huge Irishman at their head, they were passing buckets  towards the after-hold; the press of people hid the hatchway from  us until we gained the poop; but we heard the buckets spitting and a  hose-pipe hissing into the flames below; and we saw the column of white  vapor rising steadily from their midst.    At the break of the poop stood Captain Harris, his legs planted wide  apart, very vigorous, very decisive, very profane. And I must confess  that the shocking oaths which had brought us round the Horn"]]]
