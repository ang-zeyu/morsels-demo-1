It is the manifestation  of a structural or functional disorder of some part of the locomotory  apparatus, characterized by a limping or halting gait. Therefore, any  affection causing a sensation and sign of pain which is increased by the  bearing of weight upon the affected member, or by the moving of such a  distressed part, results in an irregularity in locomotion, which is  known as lameness or claudication. A halting gait may also be produced  by the abnormal development of a member, or by the shortening of the leg  occasioned by the loss of a shoe.    For descriptive purposes lameness may be classified as _true_ and  _false_. _True lameness_ is such as is occasioned by structural or  functional defects of some part of the apparatus of locomotion, such as  would be caused by spavin, ring-bone, or tendinitis. _False lameness_ is  an impediment in the gait not caused by structural or functional  disturbances, but is brought on by conditions such as may result from  the too rapid driving of an unbridle-wise colt over an irregular road  surface, or by urging a horse to trot at a pace exceeding the normal  gait of the animal's capacity, causing it to \"crow-hop\" or to lose  balance in the stride. The latter manifestation might, to the  inexperienced eye, simulate _true lameness_ of the hind legs, but in  reality, is merely the result of the animal having been forced to assume  an abnormal pace and a lack of balance in locomotion is the consequence.    The degree of lameness, though variable in different instances, is in  most cases proportionate to the causative factor, and this fact serves  as a helpful indicator in the matter of establishing a diagnosis and  giving the prognosis, especially in cases of somewhat unusual character.  An animal may be slightly lame and the exhibition of lameness be such as  to render the cause bafflingly obscure. Cases of this nature are  sometimes quite difficult to classify and in occasional instances a  positive diagnosis is impossible. Subjects of this kind may not be  sufficiently inconvenienced to warrant their being taken out of  service, yet a lame horse, no matter how slightly affected, should not  be continued in service unless it can be positively established that the  degree of discomfort occasioned by the claudication is small and the  work to be done by the animal, of the sort that will not aggravate the  condition.    Subjects that are very lame--so lame that little weight is borne by the  affected member--are, of course, unfit for service and as a rule are not  difficult of diagnosis. For instance, a fracture of the second phalanx  would cause much more lameness than an injury to the lateral ligament of  the coronary joint wherein there had occurred only a slight sprain, and  though crepitation is not recognized, the diagnostician is not justified  in excluding the possibility of fracture, if the lameness seems  disproportionate to the apparent first cause.    The course taken by cases of lameness is as variable as the degree of  its manifestation, and no one can definitely predict the duration of any  given cause of claudication.    Because of the fact that horses are not often good self-nurses at best,  and that it is difficult to enforce proper care for the parts affected,  one can not wisely state that resolution will promptly follow in an  acute involvement, nor can he predict that the case will or will not  become chronic. Experience has proved that complete or partial recovery  may result, or again, that no change may occur in any given case, and  that in some instances even where rational treatment is early  administered, a decided aggravation of the condition may follow  unaccountably.    However, because of the economic element to be reckoned with, it is of  some value to be able to give a fairly accurate prognosis in the  handling of cases of lameness, as in the majority of instances the  treatment and manner of after-care are determined"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16378"],[0,"The Art of Perfumery, and Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants (#2)"],[1,"-Sachet a la  Marechale--Mousselaine--Millefleur--Portugal Sachet--Patchouly  Sachet--Pot Pourri--Olla Podrida--Rose Sachet--Santal-wood  Sachet--Sachet (without a name)--Vervain Sachet--Vitivert--Violet  Sachet--Perfumed Leather--Russia Leather--Peau d'Espagne--Perfumed  Letter Paper--Perfumed Book-markers--Cassolettes, and Printaniers    Pastils--The Censer--Vase in the British Museum--Method of using the  Censer--Incense for Altar Service--Yellow Pastils--Dr. Paris's  Pastils--Perfumer's Pastils--Piesse's Pastils--Fumigation--The Perfume  Lamp--Incandescent Platinum--Eau a Bruler--Eau pour Bruler--Fumigating  Paper--Perfuming Spills--Odoriferous Lighters      SECTION VIII.

Among the numerous gratifications derived from the cultivation of  flowers, that of rearing them for the sake of their perfumes stands  pre-eminent. It is proved from the oldest records, that perfumes have  been in use from the earliest periods. The origin of this, like that of  many other arts, is lost in the depth of its antiquity; though it had  its rise, no doubt, in religious observances. Among the nations of  antiquity, an offering of perfumes was regarded as a token of the most  profound respect and homage. Incense, or Frankincense, which exudes by  incision and dries as a gum, from _Arbor-thurifera_, was formerly burnt  in the temples of all religions, in honor of the divinities that were  there adored. Many of the primitive Christians were put to death because  they would not offer incense to idols.        \"Of the use of these luxuries by the Greeks, and afterwards by the      Romans, Pliny and Seneca gives much information respecting perfume      drugs, the method of collecting them, and the prices at which they      sold. Oils and powder perfumery were most lavishly used, for even      three times a day did some of the luxurious people anoint and      scent themselves, carrying their precious perfumes with them to      the baths in costly and elegant boxes called NARTHECIA.\"    In the Romish Church incense is used in many ceremonies, and  particularly at the solemn funerals of the hierarchy, and other  personages of exalted rank.    Pliny makes a note of the tree from which frankincense is procured, and  certain passages in his works indicate that dried flowers were used in  his time by way of perfume, and that they were, as now, mixed with  spices, a compound which the modern perfumer calls _pot-pourri_, used  for scenting apartments, and generally placed in some ornamental Vase.    It was not uncommon among the Egyptian ladies to carry about the person  a little pouch of odoriferous gums, as is the case to the present day  among the Chinese, and to wear beads made of scented wood. The  \"bdellium\" mentioned by Moses in Genesis is a perfuming gum, resembling  frankincense, if not identical with it.    Several passages in Exodus prove the use of perfumes at a very early  period among the Hebrews. In the thirtieth chapter of Exodus the Lord  said unto Moses: \"1. And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon;  of Shittim wood shalt thou make it.\" \"7. And Aaron shall burn thereon  sweet incense every morning; when he dresseth the lamps he shall burn  incense upon it.\" \"34. Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha,  and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall  there be a like weight.\" \"35. And thou shalt make it a perfume, a  confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together pure and  holy.\" \"36. And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it  before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will  meet with thee; it shall be unto you most holy.\" \"37. And as for the  perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according  to the composition thereof; it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord.\"  \"38. Whosoever shall make like unto that to smell thereto, shall even be  cut off from his people.\"        \"It was from this religious custom, of employing incense in the      ancient temples, that the royal prophet drew that beautiful simile      of his, when he petitioned that his prayers might ascend before      the Lord like incense, Luke 1:10. It was while all the multitude      was praying without, at the hour of incense,"]]]
