Its collection of designs is full and  varied and its work of the best.    Architects will find the catalogues of these firms most valuable  reference books.    The finishing of a good floor requires care and attention as well as  special knowledge. Oil, varnish, shellac, and wax are the finishes  ordinarily used, but wax is usually the most satisfactory.    The floor should be carefully and thoroughly smoothed, so that no waves  or plane-marks will be seen, and then filled if the wood is at all  porous or open grained. This is done with preparations manufactured by  any of the firms mentioned above, or with fillers specially made for the  purpose such as those sold by Harrison Brothers & Company of  Philadelphia, or the Chicago Wood Finishing Company of Chicago. The wood  filler made by the latter firm is especially adapted for this purpose  and will give excellent results. The finish is then applied in one or  more coats as required, oil and shellac finishes usually requiring more  than one application and an intermediate rubbing down with fine  sandpaper. Shellac and ordinary varnish are usually unsatisfactory from  their tendency to wear unevenly. The Chicago Varnish Company of Chicago  supplies a varnish under the name of \"Supremis,\" which has proved by  years of use under trying conditions, such as those of asylums,  hospitals, and public buildings, to be of exceptional merit. It is  elastic, tough, and gives a fine waxy surface which can be rubbed and  will preserve its finish. It has the additional merit of being easily  applied. It dries quickly and is remarkably durable. Wax should be  carefully applied and then polished to the required finish with a  weighted brush.    Of wax finishes one very largely used is that made by the Butcher Polish  Company of Boston. It has all the best qualities of other wax finishes  and has stood the test of time and experience.    There are numerous variations in the products referred to above suited  for different purposes. The Wood-Mosaic Company makes end-wood mosaic  7/8 inch thick made of small blocks joined by means of a lead tongue;  wood carpet similar to that of S. C. Johnson; and thick and thin  parquetry. S. C. Johnson also makes a flooring of 1/4 inch face glued to  a backing of pine to make 7/8 inch, 1 inch, or 1-1/4 inch stock which is  found to stand the changes of temperature in American houses remarkably  well. The thicker floors of 7/8 inch and upwards are frequently made  with tongued and grooved joints and blind nailed.    These patterns when properly chosen are just as appropriate for stairs,  walls, or even ceilings, as for floors, and are frequently used for  these places.          Modern Mosaic Floors.      The use of mosaic floors, especially for corridors and entrances of  public and business buildings and in some positions of private  residences, is rapidly increasing, and every specimen of work gives this  art impetus. The laying of a mosaic floor is not so simple a matter as  it appears to many architects, and the fact that anyone cannot do it is  proven by the bad work one constantly runs across. It is, therefore,  advisable that work of this sort be entrusted to a concern that can be  found after the job has been finished and paid for, and that has a  reputation to maintain and a willingness to make good any imperfection  that a few months' wear will bring to light. As this number of THE  BROCHURE SERIES will often be referred to where ornamental floors are  being designed, we take pleasure not particularly in recommending a  house for executing such floors, but rather in calling attention to some  of the work executed, inspection of which will be the strongest  endorsement possible. We refer to the Murdock Parlor Grate Company of  Boston, a house known by name at least to every architect and builder of  New England.    Organized over forty years ago, and with prospects of active existence  for as many or more years to come, their contracts contain the element  of responsibility that is the best guarantee an architect can have that  his client's interests are in good hands.    The mosaic and terrazzo flooring department of the Murdock Parlor Grate  Company already has a list of over fifty public buildings in which  important work has been done. The terrazzo floors so much admired in the  new Public Library, covering a surface of 60,000 square feet, the mosaic  floor of the Members' corridor in the Massachusetts State House, and  especially the entrance to the Members' vestibule, a part of this floor,  and the lobbies to the Bowdoin Square and Keith's Theatres, Boston, also  mosaic, are examples easily inspected by Boston architects.    Other public buildings in New England in which this company have done  admirable mosaic work are the new McLean Asylum buildings, the Arlington  (Mass.) Public Library, the Exchange Club, Boston, and a number of bank  buildings.    Throughout the Back Bay district there are numberless vestibule and  hall floors in fine residences, many of which are gems in color and  design.    We have mentioned only a few examples, but almost every New England  architect can, by writing to the Murdock Parlor Grate Company, be  referred to examples of their work in his neighborhood, and we think he  will find their estimates as low as it is safe to accept, and their  responsibility is beyond all question.

For sale by Bates & Guild, Boston.  $2.50.    A review of the contents of this work is scarcely necessary, as it is  already recognized as a standard by all who are at all familiar with  architectural literature. As compared with other books upon the history  of architecture, the point of view from which the subject has been  looked at furnishes the main distinction. This cannot be better stated  than in the words of the editor of the present edition, Professor T.  Roger Smith. He says: \"It is essentially that of an academic and  classical professor, and one brought up not only in familiarity with the  best examples of ancient art, but with the habit of mind which recurs to  classic and especially to Greek originals, both as a standard of taste  and as models for treatment of modern works. This feeling, which held  sway in England in the day of Chambers, of Soane, and of Cockerell, has  now almost died out from our practice and our literature. The works of  the contemporary English and French writers on architecture, which are  now widely known and read, proceed avowedly and unmistakably on a  different basis. Such writings as those of Street or Scott,  Viollet-le-Duc, and Ruskin breathe a totally different inspiration;  while even the valuable series of architectural writings which we owe to  the pen of Mr. Fergusson are too cosmopolitan in range and too impartial  in tone for such a peculiarity as is here traceable to be visible in  them.\"    The illustrations show some of the wear and tear of former editions, but  are still of great value.

This is of  course perfectly natural and was a point which we had fully in mind in  formulating the plan of THE BROCHURE SERIES. And this was one of the  main considerations which influenced us in making the subscription price  so low. At the price of fifty cents a year, if only a dozen out of the  hundred plates are worth buying to a subscriber his year's subscription  is justified and is a good investment.    Of necessity it will be found that we shall occasionally include  subjects which some of our subscribers already have, but the importance  of this duplication is liable to be exaggerated in the minds of those  who might notice it when the number of other desirable plates is not  kept in view. It should be remembered that the classification, which we  are following, and the complete reference index which will be published  at the end of each year, and the advantage of a compact and uniform  collection which a set of the BROCHURES will give, render it much more  usable than a collection of miscellaneous plates or photographs can  possibly be. While it is not to be expected that we can choose subjects  which are entirely new to all of our thousands of subscribers, it will  be our aim to select those which will appeal to the greatest number, and  when familiar subjects are given the best obtainable photographs will be  used, and those which are least likely to be already found in American  collections.    It is now too late for those who have not already subscribed to obtain a  complete set of THE BROCHURE SERIES as our supply of the first three  numbers is exhausted, and no attempt will be made in future to carry in  stock any back numbers. Only enough copies of each issue will be printed  to supply immediate demands. On this account those who wish for the  current numbers must subscribe at once in order to make sure of them.  Less than one hundred copies of the April number are now in stock and  these are fast disappearing. Subscriptions in future will only be taken  to date from the next succeeding issue.    We wish especially to call attention to the arrangement by which clubs  of five subscriptions may be made up for $2, or 40 cents for each  subscription. A very little inquiry among one's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19368"],[0,"The Mide'wiwin or \"Grand Medicine Society\" of the Ojibwa (#2)"],[1,"portion  many of these people have adopted civilized pursuits, but throughout the  northern and northwestern part many bands continue to adhere to their  primitive methods and are commonly designated \"wild Indians.\" The  habitations of many of the latter are rude and primitive. The bands on  the northeast shore of Red Lake, as well as a few others farther east,  have occupied these isolated sites for an uninterrupted period of about  three centuries, as is affirmed by the chief men of the several villages  and corroborated by other traditional evidence.    Father Claude Allouez, upon his arrival in 1666 at Shagawaumikong, or La  Pointe, found the Ojibwa preparing to attack the Sioux. The settlement  at this point was an extensive one, and in traditions pertaining to the  \"Grand Medicine Society\" frequent allusion is made to the fact that at  this place the rites were practiced in their greatest purity.    Mr. Warren, in his History of the Ojibwa Indians,[1] bases his belief  upon traditional evidence that the Ojibwa first had knowledge of the  whites in 1612. Early in the seventeenth century the French missionaries  met with various tribes of the Algonkian linguistic stock, as well as  with bands or subtribes of the Ojibwa Indians. One of the latter,  inhabiting the vicinity of Sault Ste. Marie, is frequently mentioned  in the Jesuit Relations as the Saulteurs. This term was applied to all  those people who lived at the Falls, but from other statements it is  clear that the Ojibwa formed the most important body in that vicinity.  La Hontan speaks of the \"Outchepoues, alias Sauteurs,\" as good warriors.  The name Saulteur survives at this day and is applied to a division of  the tribe.        [Footnote 1: Coll. Minn. Hist. Soc., 1885, vol. 5, p. 130.]    According to statements made by numerous Ojibwa chiefs of importance the  tribe began its westward dispersion from La Pointe and Fond du Lac at  least two hundred and fifty years ago, some of the bands penetrating the  swampy country of northern Minnesota, while others went westward and  southwestward. According to a statement[2] of the location of the tribes  of Lake Superior, made at Mackinaw in 1736, the Sioux then occupied the  southern and northern extremities of that lake. It is possible, however,  that the northern bands of the Ojibwa may have penetrated the region  adjacent to the Pigeon River and passed west to near their present  location, thus avoiding their enemies who occupied the lake shore south  of them.        [Footnote 2: Reproduced from the ninth volume of the New York      Colonial Documents, pp. 1054, 1055.]      [Illustration: Plate II.    Ojibwa Indian Reservations in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

XII La Pointe. XIII Lac de    Flanibeau. XIV Red Cliff. XV Grand Portage.]    From recent investigations among a number of tribes of the Algonkian  linguistic division it is found that the traditions and practices  pertaining to the Mid[-e]/wiwin, Society of the Mid[-e]/ or Shamans,  popularly designated as the \"Grand Medicine Society,\" prevailed  generally, and the rites are still practiced at irregular intervals,  though in slightly different forms in various localities.    In the reports of early travelers and missionaries no special mention is  made of the Mid[-e]/, the Jes/sakk[-i]d/, or the W[^a]b[)e]n[-o]/, but  the term sorcerer or juggler is generally employed to designate that  class of persons who professed the power of prophecy, and who practiced  incantation and administered medicinal preparations. Constant reference  is made to the opposition of these personages to the introduction of  Christianity. In the light of recent investigation the cause of this  antagonism is seen to lie in the fact that the traditions of Indian  genesis and cosmogony and the ritual of initiation into the Society of  the Mid[-e]/ constitute what is to them a religion, even more powerful  and impressive than the Christian religion is to the average civilized  man. This opposition still exists among the leading classes of a number  of the Algonkian tribes, and especially among the Ojibwa, many bands of  whom have been more or less isolated and beyond convenient reach of the  Church. The purposes of the society are twofold; first, to preserve the  traditions just mentioned, and second, to give a certain class of  ambitious men and women sufficient influence through their acknowledged  power of exorcism and necromancy to lead a comfortable life at the  expense of the credulous. The persons admitted into the society are  firmly believed to possess the power of communing with various  supernatural beings--manidos--and in order that certain desires may be  realized they are sought after and consulted. The purpose of the present  paper is to give an account of this society and of the ceremony of  initiation as studied and observed at White Earth, Minnesota, in 1889.  Before proceeding to this, however, it may be of interest to consider a  few statements made by early travelers respecting the \"sorcerers or  jugglers\" and the methods of medication.    In referring to the practices of the Algonkian tribes of the Northwest,  La Hontan[3] says:      When they are sick, they only drink Broth, and eat sparingly; and if    they have the good luck to fall asleep, they think themselves cur'd:    They have told me frequently, that sleeping and sweating would cure    the most stubborn Diseases in the World. When they are so weak that    they cannot get out of Bed, their Relations come and dance and make    merry before 'em, in order to divert 'em. To conclude, when they are    ill, they are always visited by a sort of Quacks, (_Jongleurs_); of    whom 't will now be proper to subjoin two or three Words by the bye.      A _Jongleur_ is a sort of _Physician_, or rather a _Quack_, who being    once cur'd of some dangerous Distemper, has the Presumption and Folly    to fancy that he is immortal, and possessed of the Power of curing all    Diseases, by speaking to the Good and Evil Spirits. Now though every    Body rallies upon these Fellows when they are absent, and looks upon    'em as Fools that have lost their Senses by some violent Distemper,    yet they allow 'em to visit the Sick; whether it be to divert 'em with    their Idle Stories, or to have an Opportunity of seeing them rave,    skip about, cry, houl, and make Grimaces and Wry Faces, as if they    were possess'd. When all the Bustle is over, they demand a Feast of a    Stag and some large Trouts for the Company, who are thus regal'd at    once with Diversion and Good Cheer.      When the Quack comes to visit the Patient, he examines him very    carefully; _If the Evil Spirit be here_, says he, _we shall quickly    dislodge him._ This said, he withdraws by himself to a little Tent    made on purpose, where he dances, and sings houling like an Owl;    (which gives the Jesuits Occasion to say, _That the Devil converses    with 'em_.) After he has made an end of this Quack Jargon, he comes    and rubs the Patient in some part of his Body, and pulling some little    Bones out of his Mouth, acquaints the Patient, _That these very Bones    came out of his Body; that he ought to pluck up a good heart, in    regard that his Distemper is but a Trifle; and in fine, that in order    to accelerate the Cure, 't will be convenient to send his own and his    Relations Slaves to shoot Elks, Deer, &c., to the end they may all eat    of that sort of Meat, upon which his Cure does absolutely depend._      Commonly these Quacks bring 'em some Juices of Plants, which are a    sort of Purges, and are called _Maskikik_.        [Footnote 3: New Voyages to North America, London, 1703, vol. 2,      pp. 47, 48.]    Hennepin, in \"A Continuation of the New Discovery,\" etc.,[4] speaks of  the religion and sorcerers of the tribes of the St. Lawrence and those  living about the Great Lakes as follows:      We have been all too sadly convinced, that almost all the Salvages in    general have no notion of a God, and that they are not able to    comprehend the most ordinary Arguments on that Subject; others will    have a Spirit that commands, say they, in the Air. Some among 'em look    upon the Skie as a kind of Divinity; others as an _Otkon_ or    _Manitou_, either Good or Evil.      These People admit of some sort of Genius in all things; they all    believe there is a Master of Life, as they call him, but hereof they    make various applications; some of them have a lean Raven, which they    carry always along with them, and which they say is the Master of    their Life; others have an Owl, and some again a Bone, a Sea-Shell,    or some such thing;      There is no Nation among 'em which has not a sort of Juglers or    Conjuerers, which some look upon to be Wizards, but in my Opinion    there is no Great reason to believe 'em such, or to think that their    Practice favours any thing of a Communication with the Devil.      These Impostors cause themselves to be reverenced as Prophets which    fore-tell Futurity. They will needs be look'd upon to have an    unlimited Power. They boast of being able to make it Wet or Dry; to    cause a Calm or a Storm; to render Land Fruitful or Barren; and, in a    Word to make Hunters Fortunate or Unfortunate. They also pretend to    Physick, and to apply Medicines, but which are such, for the most part    as have little Virtue at all in 'em, especially to Cure that Distemper    which they pretend to.      It is impossible to imagine, the horrible Howlings and strange    Contortions that those Jugglers make of their Bodies, when they are    disposing themselves to Conjure, or raise their Enchantments.
