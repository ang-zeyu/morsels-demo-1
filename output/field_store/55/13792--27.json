That France, also, placed       herself on the side of our enemies could not surprise us. Too often       have our efforts to arrive at friendlier relations with the French       Republic come in collision with old hopes and ancient malice.         Honored Sirs: What human insight and power could do to arm a people       against the last extremities has been done with your patriotic       help. The hostility which has been smouldering for a long time in       the East and in the West has now burst into bright flames. The       present situation did not proceed from transient conflicts of       interest or diplomatic entanglements, it is the result of an ill       will which has for many years been active against the strength and       the prosperity of the German Empire. We are not incited by lust for       conquest, we are inspired by the unyielding determination to keep       for ourselves and all future generations the place which God has       given us.         From the proofs which have been given you, you will see how my       Government, and especially my Chancellor, strove up to the last       moment to avert the worst. We grasp the sword in compulsory       self-defense, with clean hands and a clean conscience.         To the peoples and races of the German Empire my call goes forth to       defend with all their strength and in brotherly co-operation with       our ally that which we have created by peaceful labor. After the       example of our fathers, firmly and faithfully, sincerely and with       chivalry, humbly before God and battling joyfully before the enemy,       let us place our trust in the eternal Omnipotence, and may He       strengthen our defense and bring it to a good end!         To you, honored sirs, the whole German people, assembled about its       Princes and its leaders, look this day. Make your decision       unanimously and quickly. That is my heartfelt wish.         Gentlemen (addressing the Deputies directly): You have read what I       said to my people the other day from the balcony of my castle. I       repeat now that I no longer know any parties. I know only Germans.       And in order to testify that you are firmly resolved without       distinction of party to stand by my side through danger and death,       I call upon the leaders of the different parties in this House to       come forward and lay their hands in mine as a pledge.             *       *       *       *       *          TO THE GERMAN ARMY AND NAVY.    Proclamation by Kaiser Wilhelm II.           After three and forty years of peace I call the men of Germany to       arms.         It has become necessary to protect our most sacred possessions, the       Fatherland, our very hearths against ruthless destruction.         Enemies on every hand! That is the situation. A mighty struggle, a       great sacrifice confronts us.         I trust that the old spirit of battle still lives on in the German       people, that powerful spirit of battle which grapples with the foe       wherever it meets it, be the cost what it may, which has ever been       the terror and fear of our enemies.         Soldiers of Germany, in you I place my trust! In each one of you       lives the passionate will to conquer, which nothing can subdue.       Each one of you knows, if need be, how to die a hero's death.         Remember our great and glorious past!         Remember that you are Germans!         God help us!         WILHELM.

An Appeal from the Kaiserin.           On the summons of the Emperor our people are preparing for an       unprecedented struggle, which it did not invoke and which it is       only carrying on in its defense. Whoever can bear arms will       joyfully hasten to the colors to defend the Fatherland with his       blood. The struggle will be gigantic and the wounds to be healed       innumerable, therefore I call upon you women and girls of Germany,       and all to whom it is not given to fight for our beloved home, for       help. Let every one now do what lies in her power to lighten the       struggle for our husbands, sons, and brothers. I know that in all       ranks of our people, without exception, the will exists to fulfill       this high ideal, but may the Lord God strengthen us in our holy       work of love, which summons us women to devote all our strength to       the Fatherland in its decisive struggle.         The organizations primarily concerned who should be supported first       have already sent out notices regarding the mustering of volunteers       and the collection of gifts of all kinds.         AUGUSTE VICTORIA.         Berlin, Aug. 6.             *       *       *       *       *          \"TO THE LAST BREATH OF MAN AND HORSE.\"    Proclamation by Kaiser Wilhelm II.         Since the foundation of the empire it has been for forty-three       years the object of the efforts of myself and my ancestors to       preserve the peace of the world and to advance by peaceful means       our vigorous development. But our adversaries were jealous of the       successes of our work. There has been latent hostility on the east       and on the west and beyond the sea. It was borne by us till now, as       we were aware of our responsibility and power. Now, however, these       adversaries wish to humiliate us, asking that we should look on       with crossed arms and watch our enemies preparing themselves for a       coming attack. They will not suffer that we maintain resolute       fidelity to our ally who is fighting for its position as a great       power and with whose humiliation our power and honor would equally       be lost. So the sword must decide.         In the midst of perfect peace the enemy surprises us. Therefore to       arms! Any dallying, any temporizing would be which our fathers       founded; to be or not to be, is the question for the empire which       our fathers founded. To be or not to be German power and German       existence. We shall resist to the last breath of man and horse, and       shall fight out the struggle even against a world of enemies. Never       has Germany been subdued when it was united. Forward with God, who       will be with us as He was with our ancestors!         Berlin, Aug. 6. WILHELM.             *       *       *       *       *          JOY IN GLORIOUS VICTORY.    Speech of Kaiser at a Parade During Swift German Advance Toward Paris.           Comrades: I have gathered you around me here in order to take joy       with you in the glorious victory which our comrades have in several       days of hot battle won with their swords. Troops out of every nook       and cranny of the empire helped one another in invincible bravery       and unshakable loyalty to win great results. There stood together       under the leadership of the son of the Bavarian King and fought,       with equal blades, troops of all ages, active, reservists, and       landwehr.         For our victory we are thankful, in the first place, to our God,       (unserem alten Gott.) He will not desert us, since we stand for a       holy cause. Many of our comrades have already fallen in battle.       They died as heroes for the Fatherland. We will think of them with       honor here, and shout to the honor of those still in the field.       Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!         We still have many a bloody battle before us. Let us hope for       further successes like this. We shall not relent, and we shall get       to the enemy's hide. We shall not lose our faith and trust in our       good old God up there, (unserem guten alten Gott dort oben.) We are       determined to win, and we must win.             *       *       *       *       *          FIRST SUCCESSFUL BATTLE.    Telegram from Kaiser Wilhelm II. to Chief of Troops in Upper Alsace,  Aug. 15.           Grateful to God, Who was with us. I thank you and your troops for       the first victory. Please convey to all the troops which took part       in the fight my imperial thanks in the name of the Fatherland.

We beseech Thee in       humility for Thy almighty aid for our German Fatherland. Bless the       entire German war force, lead us to victory, and give us grace that       we may show ourselves to be Christians toward our enemies as well.       Let us soon arrive at the peace which will everlastingly safeguard       our free and independent Germany.             *       *       *       *       *          \"UP AND AT THE FOES.\"    Kaiser's Farewell Speech to First Regiment of Foot Guards at Potsdam.           I draw the sword that with God's help I have kept all these years       in the scabbard. I have drawn the sword, which without victory and       without honor I cannot sheath again. All of you will see to it that       only in honor is it returned to the scabbard. You are my guarantee       that I can dictate peace to my enemies.

[Fig. 11.]    [Illustration: Fig. 11.]    Avoid consecutive perfect intervals. [Fig. 12.]    [Illustration: Fig. 12.]    The augmented fourth (Tritone) is not only considered bad as a melodic  interval by some authorities, but its appearance between different parts in  successive intervals is also prohibited. This prohibition, however, holds  good only when the chords in which it appears are in fundamental position,  as in Fig. 13_a_. This is shown by the fact, that if one part skips as at  _b_, there is no unpleasant effect.    [Illustration: Fig. 13.]    Avoid consecutive major thirds in major keys. In minor keys they are good.  [Fig. 14.]    [Illustration: Fig. 14.]    Use adjacent voices in writing, and do not exceed the vocal compass of a  voice.    Modulation may be resorted to within the exercises, but only to nearly  related keys; for example, in C, to G, F, a, e, or d.    At the close parts should proceed stepwise to the unison, or octave. [Fig.  15_a_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 15.]    A close as in Fig. 15_b_ may be used occasionally. In this case the  leading-tone is better in the higher part.      EXERCISES    To each of the following canti firmi write two counterpoints above, and two  below.      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 16.]          LESSON II    SECOND SPECIES      [Illustration: Fig. 17.]    All rules for the first species must be observed.    Two notes are written in the counterpoint to one of the cantus firmus,  except in the last measure. [Fig. 18_a_.] In the last measure but one the  first species may sometimes be used. [Fig. 18_b_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 18.]    Repetition of a note in any but the first species is forbidden. [Fig. 19.]    [Illustration: Fig. 19.]    The counterpoint may begin on the first or the second half of the measure,  preference being given to the second half. When it begins on the first half  it must be a unison, fifth, or octave; when on the second half, it may be  any consonance. [Fig. 20.]    [Illustration: Fig. 20.]    After the first measure the interval on the first beat should be an  imperfect consonance, as in the first species, but the fifth, or octave,  may be used occasionally.    In this and succeeding lessons, all notes in the measure not belonging to  the harmony implied on the first beat, must be treated as dissonances,  e.g., those belonging to the implied harmony may be left by a skip (_a_) or  stepwise progression (_b_) unless dissonant with the cantus firmus; then  avoid their use; if foreign to it, whether consonant (_c_) with the C.F.  or not (_d_), they must be treated as embellishments or passing-tones.  [Fig. 21.]    [Illustration: Fig. 21.]    The embellishment may be used as follows: when above the principal tone, it  may be a semitone (_a_) or a whole tone (_b_) distant from it; and when  below, a semitone (_c_). [Fig. 22.]    [Illustration: Fig. 22.]    When the counterpoint is below the cantus firmus, the fifth of the chord  needs special treatment. It is permitted on the weak beat when the lower is  treated as an harmonic passing-tone.    An harmonic passing-tone is the second of three tones belonging to the same  chord. [Fig. 23_a_.] While the third tone should be a member of the chord  containing the fifth as an harmonic passing-tone, the chord above it may  change as in Fig. 23_b_.    The fifth is permitted on the strong beat when it is only an implied fifth  (six-four chord); that is, the third and fifth appear on the strong beat,  and the root does not come in until the second half of the measure. [Fig.  23_c_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 23.]    The unison is permitted on the weak beat. [Fig. 24.]    [Illustration: Fig. 24.]    Avoid broken-chord effects, that is, do not use more than three tones  belonging to the same chord in succession. [Fig. 25.]    [Illustration: Fig. 25.]    Avoid frequent skipping of parts. [Fig. 26.]    [Illustration: Fig. 26.]    Parts may cross occasionally, but should return immediately [Fig. 27.]    [Illustration: Fig. 27.]    Consecutive fifths or octaves on consecutive strong beats are bad; but they  are good on the weak beats _if the second fifth or octave is approached in  the opposite direction from the first_. [Fig. 28.]    [Illustration: Fig. 28.]    In minor the sixth degree may occasionally be raised on the strong beat, if  it is desired to proceed upward to the raised seventh degree. [Fig. 29.]    [Illustration: Fig. 29.]    In the last measure but one, both the supertonic and leading tone should  appear. [Fig. 30.]    [Illustration: Fig. 30.]    _Three_ notes may be written to one of the cantus firmus, as in Fig. 31.  For this no new rules are required.    [Illustration: Fig. 31.]    The cadences in Fig. 32 are good. It will be seen that the cadences of the  first species may also be used.    [Illustration: Fig. 32.]      EXERCISES    To cantus firmus _a_ write two counterpoints above and two below in the  first species.    To cantus firmus _b_ write two above and two below in the second species.      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 33.]          LESSON III    SECOND SPECIES IN BOTH PARTS[1]      [Illustration: Fig. 34.]        [1] In this and similar cases the term \"species\" will be      understood as referring simply to the number of notes, or to the      note-combinations, of the contrapuntal part or parts in question.      \"Second species in both parts\" means, therefore, that both parts      progress in half-notes.    When writing second species in both parts no cantus firmus is used, both  parts being original. One part begins on the first beat, the other may  begin on either the first or second beat. [Fig. 35.]    [Illustration: Fig. 35.]    The interval formed by the two notes appearing on the second beat should be  a consonance, or one of the following dissonances: The augmented fourth,  the diminished fifth, the minor or diminished seventh when properly  resolved, and the perfect fourth when approached in contrary motion.    All tones not belonging to the harmony implied on the first beat, must be  treated as dissonances. [Fig. 36.]    [Illustration: Fig. 36.]    The seventh or ninth of the implied harmony of a measure, when approached  in an upward direction, may be used in either part, provided it is  consonant with the other part, or comes within the requirements of the  exceptions. [Fig. 37.]    The passing major seventh and its root may appear on the weak beat, even  when approached in similar motion as in Fig. 37_a_. The seventh must then be  treated as a passing-tone.    [Illustration: Fig. 37.]    The cadences in Fig. 38 are good when writing second species in both parts.  Those having the second species in one part only, may also be used.    [Illustration: Fig. 38.]    Writing the second species in both parts will, in this lesson, be confined  to a mixture of the first and second species, as in Fig. 39.    In this do not use the second species more than four measures continuously  in one part. It will be noticed that the second species may occasionally be  used in both parts. In later lessons opportunity will be given to write it  continuously in both parts.    [Illustration: Fig. 39.]      EXERCISES    Write two eight-measure phrases mixing the first and second species. [Fig.  39.]    To cantus firmus _a_ write one counterpoint above and one below, three  notes to the measure. [Fig. 31.]    To cantus firmus _b_ write one above and one below, in the second species.      CANTI FIRMI    [Illustration: Fig. 40.]          LESSON IV    THIRD SPECIES      [Illustration: Fig. 41.]    In this species, four notes are written in the counterpoint to each note  of the cantus firmus. The counterpoint may begin on the first, second, or  fourth quarter. The second quarter is, however, the most usual. [Fig. 42.]    [Illustration: Fig. 42.]    The exercises should begin and end with tonic harmony.    When the counterpoint begins on the first quarter it must form a perfect  consonance with the cantus firmus. When on the second or fourth quarter,  any consonance may be used.    All previous rules are to be regarded, unless exceptions are made.    At least one of the first three quarter-notes of a measure should be left  degreewise. [Fig. 43.]    [Illustration: Fig. 43.]    The last quarter of a measure is usually left degreewise. If approached by  a skip or by a degreewise progression of at least two quarter-notes, it may  be left by a skip in the opposite direction from which it was approached. A  skip of a third in the same direction is also good when this skip is  preceded by a skip of a third (_d_). [Fig. 44.]    [Illustration: Fig. 44.]    Parts may cross occasionally.    The use of non-harmonic tones, as in Fig. 45, is good in either part. At  _a_ the passing-tone, instead of progressing directly to the adjacent  chord-tone, skips a third to the other side of it and then returns. The  embellishment is treated in the same way, but is most effective when the  principal tone is the leading-tone, as at _b_. In both cases the  counterpoint should continue degreewise through the chord-tone. [Fig. 45.]    [Illustration: Fig. 45.]    The fifth, when in the lower part, may be used on any but the first  quarter, provided it is treated as a passing-tone, e.g., approached and  left by stepwise progression in one direction.    [Illustration: Fig. 46.]    Consecutive fifths and octaves are forbidden when appearing on the accented  beats of successive measures; between prominent notes of successive  measures not more than four quarters apart; and between a prominent note of  one measure and the first quarter of the next. [Fig. 47.]    [Illustration: Fig. 47.]    Oblique motion to the unison is bad. It is permitted if it continues in the  same direction through the unison. [Fig. 48.]    [Illustration: Fig. 48.]    The unison may be used on any but the first quarter of a measure.    Frequent repetition of a figure as in"]]]
