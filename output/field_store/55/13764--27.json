I.    THE LAND OF EGYPT.      In shape Egypt is like a lily with a crooked stem. A broad blossom  terminates it at its upper end; a button of a bud projects from the  stalk a little below the blossom, on the left-hand side. The broad  blossom is the Delta, extending from Aboosir to Tineh, a direct distance  of a hundred and eighty miles, which the projection of the coast--the  graceful swell of the petals--enlarges to two hundred and thirty. The  bud is the Fayoum, a natural depression in the hills that shut in the  Nile valley on the west, which has been rendered cultivable for many  thousands of years by the introduction into it of the Nile water,  through a canal known as the \"Bahr Yousouf.\" The long stalk of the lily  is the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15665"],[0,"New Latin Grammar (#2)"],[1,"FAMILY.    a. _The Sanskrit_, spoken in ancient India. Of this there were several  stages, the oldest of which is the Vedic, or language of the Vedic Hymns.  These Hymns are the oldest literary productions known to us among all the  branches of the Indo-European family. A conservative estimate places them  as far back as 1500 B.C. Some scholars have even set them more than a  thousand years earlier than this, i.e. anterior to 2500 B.C.    The Sanskrit, in modified form, has always continued to be spoken in India,  and is represented to-day by a large number of dialects descended from the  ancient Sanskrit, and spoken by millions of people.    b. _The Iranian_, spoken in ancient Persia, and closely related to the  Sanskrit. There were two main branches of the Iranian group, viz. the Old  Persian and the Avestan. The Old Persian was the official language of the  court, and appears in a number of so-called cuneiform[2] inscriptions, the  earliest of which date from the time of Darius I (sixth century B.C.). The  other branch of the Iranian, the Avestan,[3] is the language of the Avesta  or sacred books of the Parsees, the followers of Zoroaster, founder of the  religion of the fire-worshippers. Portions of these sacred books may have  been composed as early as 1000 B.C.    Modern Persian is a living representative of the old Iranian speech. It has  naturally been much modified by time, particularly through the introduction  of many words from the Arabic.    c. _The Armenian_, spoken in Armenia, the district near the Black Sea and  Caucasus Mountains. This is closely related to the Iranian, and was  formerly classified under that group. It is now recognized as entitled to  independent rank. The earliest literary productions of the Armenian  language date from the fourth and fifth centuries of the Christian era. To  this period belong the translation of the Scriptures and the old Armenian  Chronicle. The Armenian is still a living language, though spoken in widely  separated districts, owing to the scattered locations in which the  Armenians are found to-day.    d. _The Tokharian_. This language, only recently discovered and identified  as Indo-European, was spoken in the districts east of the Caspian Sea  (modern Turkestan). While in some respects closely related to the three  Asiatic branches of the Indo-European family already considered, in others  it shows close relationship to the European members of the family. The  literature of the Tokharian, so far as it has been brought to light,  consists mainly of translations from the Sanskrit sacred writings, and  dates from the seventh century of our era.    EUROPEAN MEMBERS OF THE INDO-EUROPEAN FAMILY.    e. _The Greek_. The Greeks had apparently long been settled in Greece and  Asia Minor as far back as 1500 B.C. Probably they arrived in these  districts much earlier. The earliest literary productions are the Iliad and  the Odyssey of Homer, which very likely go back to the ninth century B.C.  From the sixth century B.C. on, Greek literature is continuous. Modern  Greek, when we consider its distance in time from antiquity, is remarkably  similar to the classical Greek of the fourth and fifth centuries B.C.    f. _The Italic Group._ The Italic Group embraces the Umbrian, spoken in the  northern part of the Italian peninsula (in ancient Umbria); the Latin,  spoken in the central part (in Latium); the Oscan, spoken in the southern  part (in Samnium, Campania, Lucania, etc.). Besides these, there were a  number of minor dialects, such as the Marsian, Volscian, etc. Of all these  (barring the Latin), there are no remains except a few scanty inscriptions.  Latin literature begins shortly after 250 B.C. in the works of Livius  Andronicus, Naevius, and Plautus, although a few brief inscriptions are  found belonging to a much earlier period.    g. _The Celtic._ In the earliest historical times of which we have any  record, the Celts occupied extensive portions of northern Italy, as well as  certain areas in central Europe; but after the second century B.C., they  are found only in Gaul and the British Isles. Among the chief languages  belonging to the Celtic group are the Gallic, spoken in ancient Gaul; the  Breton, still spoken in the modern French province of Brittany; the Irish,  which is still extensively spoken in Ireland among the common people, the  Welsh; and the Gaelic of the Scotch Highlanders.    h. _The Teutonic._ The Teutonic group is very extensive. Its earliest  representative is the Gothic, preserved for us in the translation of the  scriptures by the Gothic Bishop Ulfilas (about 375 A.D.). Other languages  belonging to this group are the Old Norse, once spoken in Scandinavia, and  from which are descended the modern Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish;  German; Dutch; Anglo-Saxon, from which is descended the modern English.    i. _The Balto-Slavic._ The languages of this group belong to eastern  Europe. The Baltic division of the group embraces the Lithuanian and  Lettic, spoken to-day by the people living on the eastern shores of the  Baltic Sea. The earliest literary productions of these languages date from  the sixteenth century. The Slavic division comprises a large number of  languages, the most important of which are the Russian, the Bulgarian, the  Serbian, the Bohemian, the Polish. All of these were late in developing a  literature, the earliest to do so being the Old Bulgarian, in which we find  a translation of the Bible dating from the ninth century.    j. _The Albanian_, spoken in Albania and parts of Greece, Italy, and  Sicily. This is most nearly related to the Balto-Slavic group, and is  characterized by the very large proportion of words borrowed from Latin,  Turkish, Greek, and Slavic. Its literature does not begin till the  seventeenth century.    2. Home of the Indo-European Family.--Despite the many outward differences  of the various languages of the foregoing groups, a careful examination of  their structure and vocabulary demonstrates their intimate relationship and  proves overwhelmingly their descent from a common parent. We must believe,  therefore, that at one time there existed a homogeneous clan or tribe of  people speaking a language from which all the above enumerated languages  are descended. The precise location of the home of this ancient tribe  cannot be determined. For a long time it was assumed that it was in central  Asia north of the Himalaya Mountains, but this view has long been rejected  as untenable. It arose from the exaggerated importance attached for a long  while to Sanskrit. The great antiquity of the earliest literary remains of  the Sanskrit (the Vedic Hymns) suggested that the inhabitants of India were  geographically close to the original seat of the Indo-European Family.  Hence the home was sought in the elevated plateau to the north. To-day it  is thought that central or southeastern Europe is much more likely to have  been the cradle of the Indo-European parent-speech, though anything like a  logical demonstration of so difficult a problem can hardly be expected.    As to the size and extent of the original tribe whence the Indo-European  languages have sprung, we can only speculate. It probably was not large,  and very likely formed a compact racial and linguistic unit for centuries,  possibly for thousands of years.    The time at which Indo-European unity ceased and the various individual  languages began their separate existence, is likewise shrouded in  obscurity. When we consider that the separate existence of the Sanskrit may  antedate 2500 B.C., it may well be believed that people speaking the  Indo-European parent-speech belonged to a period as far back as 5000 B.C.,  or possibly earlier.    3. Stages in the Development of the Latin Language.--The earliest remains  of the Latin language are found in certain very archaic inscriptions. The  oldest of these belong to the sixth and seventh centuries B.C. Roman  literature does not begin till several centuries later, viz. shortly after  the middle of the third century B.C. We may recognize the following clearly  marked periods of the language and literature:    a. _The Preliterary Period_, from the earliest times down to 240 B.C., when  Livius Andronicus brought out his first play. For this period our knowledge  of Latin depends almost exclusively upon the scanty inscriptions that have  survived from this remote time. Few of these are of any length.    b. _The Archaic Period_, from Livius Andronicus (240 B.C.) to Cicero (81  B.C.). Even in this age the language had already become highly developed as  a medium of expression. In the hands of certain gifted writers it had even  become a vehicle of power and beauty. In its simplicity, however, it  naturally marks a contrast with the more finished diction of later days. To  this period belong:      Livius Andronicus, about 275-204 B.C. (Translation of Homer's Odyssey;        Tragedies).    Plautus, about 250-184 B.C. (Comedies).    Naevius, about 270-199 B.C. (\"Punic War\"; Comedies).    Ennius, 239-169 B.C. (\"Annals\"; Tragedies).    Terence, about 190-159 B.C. (Comedies).    Lucilius, 180-103 B.C. (Satires).    Pacuvius, 220-about 130 B.C. (Tragedies).    Accius, 170-about 85 B.C. (Tragedies).    c. _The Golden Age_, from Cicero (81 B.C.) to the death of Augustus (14  A.D.). In this period the language, especially in the hands of Cicero,  reaches a high degree of stylistic perfection. Its vocabulary, however, has  not yet attained its greatest fullness and range. Traces of the diction of  the Archaic Period are often noticed, especially in the poets, who  naturally sought their effects by reverting to the speech of olden times.  Literature reached its culmination in this epoch, especially in the great  poets of the Augustan Age. The following writers belong here:      Lucretius, about 95-55 B.C. (Poem on Epicurean Philosophy).    Catullus, 87-about 54 B.C. (Poet).    Cicero, 106-43 B.C. (Orat"]]]
