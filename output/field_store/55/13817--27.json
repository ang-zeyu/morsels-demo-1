He argues that, since the  planets, stars, and nebulae have been scanned by Herschel and Rosse, with  their gigantic mirrors, and at Pulkova and Greenwich with refractors  whose construction has taxed to the utmost the ingenuity of the  optician and mechanic, it must be utterly useless for an unpractised  observer to direct a telescope of moderate power to the examination of  these objects.    Now, passing over the consideration that a small telescope may afford  its possessor much pleasure of an intellectual and elevated character,  even if he is never able by its means to effect original discoveries,  two arguments may be urged in favour of independent telescopic  observation. In the first place, the student who wishes to appreciate  the facts and theories of astronomy should familiarize himself with the  nature of that instrument to which astronomers have been most largely  indebted. In the second place, some of the most important discoveries in  astronomy have been effected by means of telescopes of moderate power  used skilfully and systematically. One instance may suffice to show what  can be done in this way. The well-known telescopist Goldschmidt (who  commenced astronomical observation at the age of forty-eight, in 1850)  added fourteen asteroids to the solar system, not to speak of important  discoveries of nebulae and variable stars, by means of a telescope only  five feet in focal length, mounted on a movable tripod stand.    The feeling experienced by those who look through a telescope for the  first time,--especially if it is directed upon a planet or nebula--is  commonly one of disappointment. They have been told that such and such  powers will exhibit Jupiter's belts, Saturn's rings, and the  continent-outlines on Mars; yet, though perhaps a higher power is  applied, they fail to detect these appearances, and can hardly believe  that they are perfectly distinct to the practised eye.    The expectations of the beginner are especially liable to  disappointment in one particular. He forms an estimate of the view he is  to obtain of a planet by multiplying the apparent diameter of the planet  by the magnifying power of his telescope, and comparing the result with  the apparent diameter of the sun or moon. Let us suppose, for instance,  that on the day of observation Jupiter's apparent diameter is 45\", and  that the telescopic power applied is 40, then in the telescope Jupiter  should appear to have a diameter of 1800\", or half a degree, which is  about the same as the moon's apparent diameter. But when the observer  looks through the telescope he obtains a view--interesting, indeed, and  instructive--but very different from what the above calculation would  lead him to expect. He sees a disc apparently much smaller than the  moon's, and not nearly so well-defined in outline; in a line with the  disc's centre there appear three or four minute dots of light, the  satellites of the planet; and, perhaps, if the weather is favourable and  the observer watchful, he will be able to detect faint traces of belts  across the planet's disc.    Yet in such a case the telescope is not in fault. The planet really  appears of the estimated size. In fact, it is often possible to prove  this in a very simple manner. If the observer wait until the planet and  the moon are pretty near together, he will find that it is possible to  view the planet with one eye through the telescope and the moon with the  unaided eye, in such a manner that the two discs may coincide, and thus  their relative apparent dimensions be at once recognised. Nor should the  indistinctness and incompleteness of the view be attributed to  imperfection of the telescope; they are partly due to the nature of the  observation and the low power employed, and partly to the inexperience  of the beginner.    It is to such a beginner that the following pages are specially  addressed, with the hope of affording him aid and encouragement in the  use of one of the most enchanting of scientific instruments,--an  instrument that has created for astronomers a new sense, so to speak, by  which, in the words of the ancient poet:        Subjecere oculis distantia sidera nostris,        AEtheraque ingenio supposuere suo.    In the first place, it is necessary that the beginner should rightly  know what is the nature of the instrument he is to use. And this is the  more necessary because, while it is perfectly easy to obtain such  knowledge without any profound acquaintance with the science of optics,  yet in many popular works on this subject the really important points  are omitted, and even in scientific works such points are too often left  to be gathered from a formula. When the observer has learnt what it is  that his instrument is actually to do for him, he will know how to  estimate its performance, and how to vary the application of its  powers--whether illuminating or magnifying--according to the nature of  the object to be observed.    Let us consider what it is that limits the range of _natural_ vision  applied to distant objects. What causes an object to become invisible as  its distance increases? Two things are necessary that an object should  be visible. It must be _large_ enough to be appreciated by the eye, and  it must _send light_ enough. Thus increase of distance may render an  object invisible, either through diminution of its apparent size, or  through diminution in the quantity of light it sends to the eye, or  through both these causes combined. A telescope, therefore, or (as its  name implies) an instrument to render distant objects visible, must be  both a magnifying and an illuminating instrument.    [Illustration: _Fig. 1._]    Let EF, fig. 1, be an object, not near to AB as in the figure, but so  far off that the bounding lines from A and B would meet at the point  corresponding to the point P. Then if a large convex glass AB (called an  _object-glass_) be interposed between the object and the eye, all those  rays which, proceeding from P, fall on AB, will be caused to converge  nearly to a point _p_. The same is true for every point of the object  EMF, and thus a small image, _emf_, will be formed. This image will not  lie exactly on a flat surface, but will be curved about the point midway  between A and B as a centre. Now if the lens AB is removed, and an eye  is placed at _m_ to view the distant object EMF, those rays only from  each point of the object which fall on the pupil of the eye (whose  diameter is about equal to _mp_ suppose) will serve to render the object  visible. On the other hand, every point of the image _emf_ has received  the whole of the light gathered up by the large glass AB. If then we can  only make this light _available_, it is clear that we shall have  acquired a large increase of _light_ from the distant object. Now it  will be noticed that the light which has converged to _p_, diverges from  _p_ so that an eye, placed that this diverging pencil of rays may fall  upon it, would be too small to receive the whole of the pencil. Or, if  it did receive the whole of this pencil, it clearly could not receive  the whole of the pencils proceeding from other parts of the image _emf_.  _Something_ would be gained, though, even in this case, since it is  clear that an eye thus placed at a distance of ten inches from _emf_  (which is about the average distance of distinct vision) would not only  receive much more light from the image _emf_, than it would from the  object EMF, but see the image much larger than the object. It is in this  way that a simple object-glass forms a telescope, a circumstance we  shall presently have to notice more at length. But we want to gain the  full benefit of the light which has been gathered up for us by our  object-glass. We therefore interpose a small convex glass _ab_ (called  an eye-glass) between the image and the eye, at such a distance from the  image that the divergent pencil of rays is converted into a pencil of  parallel or nearly parallel rays. Call this an emergent pencil. Then all  the emergent pencils now converge to a point on the axial line _m_M  (produced beyond _m_), and an eye suitably placed can take in all of  them at once. Thus the whole, or a large part, of the image is seen at  once. But the image is seen inverted as shown. This is the Telescope, as  it was first discovered, and such an arrangement would now be called a  _simple astronomical Telescope_.    Let us clearly understand what each part of the astronomical telescope  does for us:--    The object-glass AB gives us an illuminated image, the amount of  illumination depending on the size of the object-glass. The eye-glass  enables us to examine the image microscopically.    We may apply eye-glasses of different focal length. It is clear that the  shorter the focal length of _ab_, the nearer must _ab_ be placed to the  image, and the smaller will the emergent pencils be, but the greater the  magnifying power of the eye-glass. If the emergent pencils are severally  larger than the pupil of the eye, light is wasted at the expense of  magnifying power. Therefore the eye-glass should never be of greater  focal length than that which makes the emergent pencils about equal in  diameter to the pupil of the eye. On the other hand, the eye-glass must  not be of such small focal length that the image appears indistinct and  contorted, or dull for want of light.    [Illustration: _Fig. 2._]    Let us compare with the arrangement exhibited in fig. 1 that adopted by  Galileo. Surprise is sometimes expressed that this instrument, which in  the hands of the great Florentine astronomer effected so much, should  now be known as the _non-astronomical Telescope_. I think this will be  readily understood when we compare the two arrangements.    In the Galilean Telescope a small concave eye-glass, _ab_ (fig. 2), is  placed between the object-glas"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16772"],[0,"The Story of a Soul (L'Histoire d'une Âme): The Autobiography of St. Thérèse of (#2)"],[1,"this is  an essential condition, but you must not be disheartened. Go back  to your own country, apply yourself diligently, and when you have  ended your studies we shall receive you with open arms.\"    Louis was disappointed. He set out for home--for exile he would  have said--but ere long he saw clearly that his life was to be  dedicated to God in another and equally fruitful way, and that the  Alpine monastery was to be nothing more to him than a sweet memory.    *   *   *   *   *   *    A few years after the vain quest of Louis Martin, a similar scene  was enacted in Alencon itself. Accompanied by her mother, Zelie  Guerin--an attractive and pious girl--presented herself at the  Convent of the Sisters of Charity in the hope of gaining  admission. For years it had been her desire to share the Sisters'  work, but this was not to be. In the interview that followed, the  Superioress--guided by the Holy Ghost--decided unhesitatingly  that Zelie's vocation was not for the religious life. God wanted  her in the world, and so she returned to her parents, and to the  companionship of her elder sister and her younger brother. Shortly  afterwards the gates of the Visitation Convent at Le Mans closed  upon her beloved sister, and Zelie's thoughts turned to the  Sacrament of Holy Matrimony. \"O my God\"--she repeated constantly--  \"since I am unworthy to be Thy Spouse, like my dear sister, I  shall enter the married state to fulfill Thy Holy Will, and I  beseech Thee to make me the mother of many children, and to grant  that all of them may be dedicated to Thee.\"    God gave ear to her prayer, and His Finger was visible in the  circumstances which led to her becoming the wife of Louis Martin,  on July 12, 1858, in Alencon's lovely Church of Notre Dame. Like  the chaste Tobias, they were joined together in matrimony--\"solely  for the love of children, in whom God's Name might be blessed for  ever and ever.\" Nine white flowers bloomed in this sacred garden.  Of the nine, four were transplanted to Paradise ere their buds had  quite unfolded, while five were gathered in God's walled gardens  upon earth, one entering the Visitation Convent at Caen, the others the  Carmel of Lisieux. From the cradle all were dedicated to Mary  Immaculate, and all received her name: Marie Louise, Marie Pauline,  Marie Leonie, Marie Helene, who died at the age of four and a half,  Marie Joseph Louis, Marie Joseph Jean Baptiste, Marie Celine, Marie  Melanie Therese, who died when three months old, and lastly, _Marie  Francoise Therese._    The two boys were the fruit of prayers and tears. After the birth  of the four elder girls, their parents entreated St. Joseph to  obtain for them the favour of a son who should become a priest and  a missionary. Marie Joseph soon was given them, and his pretty  ways appealed to all hearts, but only five months had run their  course when Heaven demanded what it had lent. Then followed more  urgent novenas.    The grandeur of the Priesthood, glorious upon earth, ineffable in  eternity, was so well understood by those Christian parents, that  their hearts coveted it most dearly. At all costs the family must  have a Priest of the Lord, one who would be an apostle,  peradventure a martyr. But, \"the thoughts of the Lord are not our  thoughts, His ways are not our ways.\" Another little Joseph was  born, and with him hope once again grew strong. Alas! Nine months  had scarcely passed when he, too, fled from this world and joined  his angel brother.    They did not ask again. Yet, could the veil of the future have  been lifted, their heavy hearts would, of a surety, have been  comforted. A child was to be vouchsafed them who would be a herald  of Divine love, not to China alone, but to all the ends of the  earth.    Nay, they themselves were destined to shine as apostles, and we  read on one of the first pages of the Portuguese edition of the  Autobiography, these significant words of an eminent Jesuit:    \"To the Sacred Memory of Louis Joseph Stanislaus Martin and of  Zelie Guerin, the blessed parents of Sister Teresa of the Child  Jesus, for an example to all Christian parents.\"    They little dreamed of this future apostolate, nevertheless they  made ready their souls day by day to be God's own instruments in  God's good time. With most loving resignation they greeted the  many crosses which the Lord laid upon them--the Lord whose tender  name of Father is truest in the dark hour of trial.    Every morning saw them at Mass; together they knelt at the Holy  Table. They strictly observed the fasts and abstinences of the  Church, kept Sunday as a day of complete rest from work in spite  of the remonstrance of friends, and found in pious reading their  most delightful recreation. They prayed in common--after the  touching example of Captain Martin, whose devout way of repeating  the _Our Father_ brought tears to all eyes. Thus the great  Christian virtues flourished in their home. Wealth did not bring  luxury in its train, and a strict simplicity was invariably  observed.    \"How mistaken are the great majority of men!\" Madame Martin used  often to say. \"If they are rich, they at once desire honours; and  if these are obtained, they are still unhappy; for never can that  heart be satisfied which seeks anything but God.\"    Her whole ambition as a mother was directed to Heaven. \"Four of my  children are already well settled in life,\" she once wrote; \"and  the others will go likewise to that Heavenly Kingdom--enriched  with greater merit because the combat will have been more  prolonged.\"    Charity in all its forms was a natural outlet to the piety of  these simple hearts. Husband and wife set aside each year a  considerable portion of their earnings for the Propagation of the  Faith; they relieved poor persons in distress, and ministered to  them with their own hands. On one occasion Monsieur Martin, like a  good Samaritan, was seen to raise a drunken man from the ground in  a busy thoroughfare, take his bag of tools, support him on his  arm, and lead him home. Another time when he saw, in a railway  station, a poor and starving epileptic without the means to return  to his distant home, he was so touched with pity that he took off  his hat and, placing in it an alms, proceeded to beg from the  passengers on behalf of the sufferer. Money poured in, and it was  with a heart brimming over with gratitude that the sick man  blessed his benefactor.    Never did he allow the meannesses of human respect to degrade his  Christian dignity. In whatever company he might be, he always  saluted the Blessed Sacrament when passing a Church; and he never  met a priest without paying him a mark of respect. A word from his  lips sufficed to silence whosoever dared blaspheme in his presence.    In reward for his virtues, God showered even temporal blessings on  His faithful servant. In 1871 he was able to give up his business  as a jeweller, and retire to a house in the Rue St. Blaise. The  making of point-lace, however, begun by Madame Martin, was still  carried on.    In that house the \"Little Flower of Jesus\" first saw the sunshine.  Again and again, in the pages of her Autobiography, she calls  herself by this modest name of the _Little Flower,_ emblematic of  her humility, her purity, her simplicity, and it may be added, of  the poetry of her soul. The reader will learn in the Epilogue how  it was also used by one of her favourite martyr-saints--the now  Blessed Theophane Venard. On the manuscript of her Autobiography  she set the title: _\"The Story of the Springtime of a little white  Flower,\"_ and in truth such it was, for long ere the rigours of  life's winter came round, the Flower was blossoming in Paradise.    It was, however, in mid-winter, January 2, 1873, that this ninth  child of Louis Martin and Zelie Guerin was born. Marie and Pauline  were at home for the Christmas holidays from the Visitation  Convent at Le Mans, and though there was, it is true, a slight  disappointment that the future priest was still denied them, it  quickly passed, and the little one was regarded as a special gift  from Heaven.  Later on, her beloved Father delighted in calling  her his \"Little Queen,\" adding at times the high-sounding  titles--\"Of France and Navarre.\"    The Little Queen was indeed well received that winter's morning,  and in the course of the day a poor waif rang timidly at the door  of the happy home, and presented a paper bearing the following  simple stanza:    \"Smile and swiftly grow; All beckons thee to joy, Sweet love, and  tenderest care. Smile gladly at the dawn, Bud of an hour!--for  thou Shalt be a stately rose.\"    It was a charming prophecy, for the bud unfolded its petals and  became a rose--a rose of love--but not for long, \"for the space of  a morn!\"    *   *   *   *   *   *    On January 4, she was carried to the Church of Notre Dame to  receive the Sacrament of Baptism; her eldest sister, Marie, was  her godmother, and she was given the name of _Marie Francoise  Therese._[1]    All was joy at first, but soon the tender bud drooped on its  delicate stem: little hope was held out--it must wither and die.  \"You must pray to St. Francis de Sales,\" wrote her aunt from the  convent at Le Mans, \"and you must promise, if the child recovers,  to call her by her second name, Frances.\" This was a sword-thrust  for the Mother. Leaning over the cradle of her Therese, she  awaited the coming of the end, saying: \"Only when the last hope  has gone, will I promise to call her Frances.\"    The gentle St. Francis waived his claim in favour of the great  Reformer of the Carmelite Order: the child recovered, and so  retained her sweet name of Therese. Sorrow, however, was mixed  with the Mother's joy, when it became necessary to send the babe  to a foster-mother in the country. There the \"little rose-bud\"  grew in beauty, and after some months had gained strength  sufficient to allow of her being brought back to Alencon. Her"]]]
