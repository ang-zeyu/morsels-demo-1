The girl stared more stupidly than ever.    \"No, sir,\" she said: \"she don't, sir; she's fast asleep!\"    \"But some one 'phoned me!\" I insisted, rather irritably, I fear.    \"Not from here, sir,\" declared the now wide-eyed girl. \"We haven't got  a telephone, sir.\"    For a few moments I stood there, staring as foolishly as she; then  abruptly I turned and descended the steps. At the gate I stood looking  up and down the road. The houses were all in darkness. What could be  the meaning of the mysterious summons? I had made no mistake  respecting the name of my patient; it had been twice repeated over the  telephone; yet that the call had not emanated from Mrs. Hewett's house  was now palpably evident. Days had been when I should have regarded  the episode as preluding some outrage, but to-night I felt more  disposed to ascribe it to a silly practical joke.    Eltham walked up briskly.    \"You're in demand to-night, doctor,\" he said. \"A young person called  for you almost directly you had left your house, and, learning where  you were gone, followed you.\"    \"Indeed!\" I said, a trifle incredulously. \"There are plenty of other  doctors if the case is an urgent one.\"    \"She may have thought it would save time as you were actually up and  dressed,\" explained Eltham; \"and the house is quite near to here, I  understand.\"    I looked at him a little blankly. Was this another effort of the  unknown jester?    \"I have been fooled once,\" I said. \"That 'phone call was a hoax--\"    \"But I feel certain,\" declared Eltham earnestly, \"that this is  genuine! The poor girl was dreadfully agitated; her master has broken  his leg and is lying helpless: number 280 Rectory Grove.\"    \"Where is the girl?\" I asked sharply.    \"She ran back directly she had given me her message.\"    \"Was she a servant?\"    \"I should imagine so: French, I think. But she was so wrapped up I had  little more than a glimpse of her. I am sorry to hear that some one  has played a silly joke on you, but believe me\"--he was very  earnest--\"this is no jest. The poor girl could scarcely speak for  sobs. She mistook me for you, of course.\"    \"Oh!\" said I grimly; \"well, I suppose I must go. Broken leg, you  said?--and my surgical bag, splints and so forth, are at home!\"    \"My dear Petrie!\" cried Eltham, in his enthusiastic way, \"you no doubt  can do something to alleviate the poor man's suffering immediately. I  will run back to your rooms for the bag and rejoin you at 280 Rectory  Grove.\"    \"It's awfully good of you, Eltham--\"    He held up his hand.    \"The call of suffering humanity, Petrie, is one which I may no more  refuse to hear than you.\"    I made no further protest after that, for his point of view was  evident and his determination adamantine, but told him where he would  find the bag and once more set out across the moon-bright common, he  pursuing a westerly direction and I going east.    Some three hundred yards I had gone, I suppose, and my brain had been  very active the while, when something occurred to me which placed a  new complexion upon this second summons. I thought of the falsity of  the first, of the improbability of even the most hardened practical  joker practising his wiles at one o'clock in the morning. I thought of  our recent conversation; above all I thought of the girl who had  delivered the message to Eltham, the girl whom he had described as a  French maid--whose personal charm had so completely enlisted his  sympathies. Now, to this train of thought came a new one, and, adding  it, my suspicion became almost a certainty.    I remembered (as, knowing the district, I should have remembered  before) that there was no number 280 Rectory Grove.    Pulling up sharply, I stood looking about me. Not a living soul was in  sight; not even a policeman. Where the lamps marked the main paths  across the common nothing moved; in the shadows about me nothing  stirred. But something stirred within me--a warning voice which for  long had lain dormant.    What was afoot?    A breeze caressed the leaves overhead, breaking the silence with  mysterious whisperings. Some portentous truth was seeking for  admittance to my brain. I strove to reassure myself, but the sense of  impending evil and of mystery became heavier. At last I could combat  my strange fears no longer. I turned and began to run towards the  south side of the common--towards my rooms--and after Eltham.    I had hoped to head him off, but came upon no sign of him. An  all-night tramcar passed at the moment that I reached the high-road,  and as I ran around behind it I saw that my windows were lighted and  that there was a light in the hall.    My key was yet in the lock when my housekeeper opened the door.    \"There's a gentleman just come, doctor,\" she began.    I thrust past her and raced up the stairs to my study.    Standing by the writing-table was a tall thin man, his gaunt face  brown as a coffee-berry and his steely grey eyes fixed upon me. My  heart gave a great leap--and seemed to stand still.    It was Nayland Smith!    \"Smith!\" I cried. \"Smith, old man, by God, I'm glad to see you!\"    He wrung my hand hard, looking at me with his searching eyes; but  there was little enough of gladness in his face. He was altogether  greyer than when last I had seen him--greyer and sterner.    \"Where is Eltham?\" I asked.    Smith started back as though I had struck him.    \"Eltham!\" he whispered--\"_Eltham_! is Eltham here?\"    \"I left him ten minutes ago on the common.\"    Smith dashed his right fist into the palm of his left hand, and his  eyes gleamed almost wildly.    \"My God, Petrie!\" he said, \"am I fated _always_ to come too late?\"    My dreadful fears in that instant were confirmed. I seemed to feel my  legs totter beneath me.    \"Smith, you don't mean--\"    \"I do, Petrie!\" His voice sounded very far away. \"Fu-Manchu is here;  and Eltham, God help him ... is his first victim!\"          CHAPTER II    ELTHAM VANISHES      Smith went racing down the stairs like a man possessed. Heavy with  such a foreboding of calamity as I had not known for two years, I  followed him--along the hall and out into the road. The very peace and  beauty of the night in some way increased my mental agitation. The sky  was lighted almost tropically with such a blaze of stars as I could  not recall to have seen since, my futile search concluded, I had left  Egypt. The glory of the moonlight yellowed the lamps speckled across  the expanse of the common. The night was as still as night can ever be  in London. The dimming pulse of a cab or car alone disturbed the  quietude.    With a quick glance to right and left, Smith ran across on to the  common, and, leaving the door wide open behind me, I followed. The  path which Eltham had pursued terminated almost opposite to my house.  One's gaze might follow it, white and empty, for several hundred yards  past the pond, and farther, until it became overshadowed and was lost  amid a clump of trees.    I came up with Smith, and side by side we ran on, whilst pantingly I  told my tale.    \"It was a trick to get you away from him!\" cried Smith. \"They meant no  doubt to make some attempt at your house, but, as he came out with  you, an alternative plan--\"    Abreast of the pond, my companion slowed down, and finally stopped.    \"Where did you last see Eltham?\" he asked, rapidly.    I took his arm, turning him slightly to the right, and pointed across  the moon-bathed common.    \"You see that clump of bushes on the other side of the road?\" I said.  \"There's a path to the left of it. I took that path and he took this.  We parted at the point where they meet--\"    Smith walked right down to the edge of the water and peered about over  the surface.    What he hoped to find there I could not imagine. Whatever it had been  he was disappointed, and he turned to me again, frowning perplexedly,  and tugging at the lobe of his left ear, an old trick which reminded  me of gruesome things we had lived through in the past.    \"Come on,\" he jerked. \"It may be amongst the trees.\"    From the tone of his voice I knew that he was tensed up nervously, and  his mood but added to the apprehension of my own.    \"_What_ may be amongst the trees, Smith?\" I asked.    He walked on.    \"God knows, Petrie; but I fear--\"    Behind us, along the high-road, a tramcar went rocking by, doubtless  bearing a few belated workers homeward. The stark incongruity of the  thing was appalling. How little those weary toilers, hemmed about with  the commonplace, suspected that almost within sight from the car  windows, amid prosy benches, iron railings, and unromantic, flickering  lamps, two fellow-men moved upon the border of a horror-land!    Beneath the trees a shadow carpet lay, its edges tropically sharp; and  fully ten yards from the first of the group, we two, hatless both, and  sharing a common dread, paused for a moment and listened.    The car had stopped at the farther extremity of the common, and now  with a moan that grew to a shriek was rolling on its way again. We  stood and listened until silence reclaimed the night. Not a footstep  could be heard. Then slowly we walked on. At the edge of the little  coppice we stopped again abruptly.    Smith turned and thrust his pistol into my hand. A white ray of light  pierced the shadows; my companion carried an electric torch. But no  trace of Eltham was discoverable.    There had been a heavy shower of rain during the evening, just before  sunset, and although the open paths were dry again, under the trees  the ground was still moist. Ten yards within the coppice we came upon  tracks--the tracks of one running, as the deep imprints of the toes  indicated.

Ross could not time  his. But at last the weight of a giant hand clamped down on his chest,  and he fought for breath until the world exploded about him.    He came back to consciousness slowly. For a second he thought he was  blind. Then he began to sort out one shade of grayish light from  another. Finally, Ross became aware that he no longer rested on his  back, but was slumped in a seat. The world about him was wrung with a  vibration that beat in turn through his body.    Ross Murdock had remained at liberty as long as he had because he was  able to analyze a situation quickly. Seldom in the past five years had  he been at a loss to deal with any challenging person or action. Now he  was aware that he was on the defensive and was being kept there. He  stared into the dark and thought hard and furiously. He was convinced  that everything that was happening to him this day was designed with  only one end in view--to shake his self-confidence and make him pliable.  Why?    Ross had an enduring belief in his own abilities and he also possessed  a kind of shrewd understanding seldom granted to one so young. He knew  that while Murdock was important to Murdock, he was none too important  in the scheme of things as a whole. He had a record--a record so bad  that Rawle might easily have thrown the book at him. But it differed in  one important way from that of many of his fellows; until now he had  been able to beat most of the raps. Ross believed this was largely  because he had always worked alone and taken pains to plan a job in  advance.    Why now had Ross Murdock become so important to someone that they would  do all this to shake him? He was a volunteer--for what? To be a guinea  pig for some bug they wanted to learn how to kill cheaply and easily?  They'd been in a big hurry to push him off base. Using the silent  treatment, this rushing around in planes, they were really working to  keep him groggy. So, all right, he'd give them a groggy boy all set up  for their job, whatever it was. Only, was his act good enough to fool  the major? Ross had a hunch that it might not be, and that really hurt.    It was deep night now. Either they had flown out of the path of the  storm or were above it. There were stars shining through the cover of  the cockpit, but no moon.    Ross's formal education was sketchy, but in his own fashion he had  acquired a range of knowledge which would have surprised many of the  authorities who had had to deal with him. All the wealth of a big city  library had been his to explore, and he had spent much time there,  soaking up facts in many odd branches of learning. Facts were very  useful things. On at least three occasions assorted scraps of knowledge  had preserved Ross's freedom, once, perhaps his life.    Now he tried to fit together the scattered facts he knew about his  present situation into some proper pattern. He was inside some new type  of super-super atomjet, a machine so advanced in design that it would  not have been used for anything that was not an important mission. Which  meant that Ross Murdock had become necessary to someone, somewhere.  Knowing that fact should give him a slight edge in the future, and he  might well need such an edge. He'd just have to wait, play dumb, and use  his eyes and ears.    At the rate they were shooting along they ought to be out of the country  in a couple of hours. Didn't the Government have bases half over the  world to keep the \"cold peace\"? Well, there was nothing for it. To be  planted abroad someplace might interfere with plans for escape, but he'd  handle that detail when he was forced to face it.    Then suddenly Ross was on his back once more, the giant hand digging  into his chest and middle. This time there were no lights on the ground  to guide them in. Ross had no intimation that they had reached their  destination until they set down with a jar which snapped his teeth  together.    The major wriggled out, and Ross was able to stretch his cramped body.  But the other's hand was already on his shoulder, urging him along. Ross  crawled free and clung dizzily to a ladderlike disembarking structure.    Below there were no lights, only an expanse of open snow. Men were  moving across that blank area, gathering at the foot of the ladder. Ross  was hungry and very tired. If the major wanted to play games, he hoped  that such action could wait until the next morning.    In the meantime he must learn where \"here\" was. If he had a chance to  run, he wanted to know the surrounding territory. But that hand was on  his arm, drawing him along toward a door that stood half-open. As far as  Ross could see, it led to the interior of a hillock of snow. Either the  storm or men had done a very good cover-up job, and somehow Ross knew  the camouflage was intentional.    That was Ross's introduction to the base, and after his arrival his view  of the installation was extremely limited. One day was spent in  undergoing the most searching physical he had ever experienced. And  after the doctors had poked and pried he was faced by a series of other  tests no one bothered to explain. Thereafter he was introduced to  solitary, that is, confined to his own company in a cell-like room with  a bunk that was more comfortable than it looked and an announcer in a  corner of the ceiling. So far he had been told exactly nothing. And so  far he had asked no questions, stubbornly keeping up his end of what he  believed to be a tug of wills. At the moment, safely alone and lying  flat on his bunk he eyed the announcer, a very dangerous young man and  one who refused to yield an inch.    \"Now hear this....\" The voice transmitted through that grill was  metallic, but its rasp held overtones of Kelgarries' voice. Ross's lips  tightened. He had explored every inch of the walls and knew that there  was no trace of the door which had admitted him. With only his bare  hands to work with he could not break out, and his only clothes were the  shirt, sturdy slacks, and a pair of soft-soled moccasins that they had  given him.    \"... to identify ...\" droned the voice. Ross realized that he must have  missed something, not that it mattered. He was almost determined not to  play along any more.    There was a click, signifying that Kelgarries was through braying. But  the customary silence did not close in again. Instead, Ross heard a  clear, sweet trilling which he vaguely associated with a bird. His  acquaintance with all feathered life was limited to city sparrows and  plump park pigeons, neither of which raised their voices in song, but  surely those sounds were bird notes. Ross glanced from the mike in the  ceiling to the opposite wall and what he saw there made him sit up, with  the instant response of an alerted fighter.    For the wall was no longer there! Instead, there was a sharp slope of  ground cutting down from peaks where the dark green of fir trees ran  close to the snow line. Patches of snow clung to the earth in sheltered  places, and the scent of those pines was in Ross's nostrils, real as the  wind touching him with its chill.    He shivered as a howl sounded loudly and echoed, bearing the age-old  warning of a wolf pack, hungry and a-hunt. Ross had never heard that  sound before, but his human heritage subconsciously recognized it for  what it was--death on four feet. Similarly, he was able to identify the  gray shadows slinking about the nearest trees, and his hands balled into  fists as he looked wildly about him for some weapon.    The bunk was under him and three of the four walls of the room enclosed  him like a cave. But one of those gray skulkers had raised its head and  was looking directly at him, its reddish eyes alight. Ross ripped the  top blanket off the bunk with a half-formed idea of snapping it at the  animal when it sprang.    Stiff-legged, the beast advanced, a guttural growl sounding deep in its  throat. To Ross the animal, larger than any dog he had even seen and  twice as vicious, was a monster. He had the blanket ready before he  realized that the wolf was not watching him after all, and that its  attention was focused on a point out of his line of vision.    The wolfs muzzle wrinkled in a snarl, revealing long yellow-white teeth.  There was a singing twang, and the animal leaped into the air, fell  back, and rolled on the ground, biting despairingly at a shaft  protruding from just behind its ribs. It howled again, and blood broke  from its mouth.    Ross was beyond surprise now. He pulled himself together and got up, to  walk steadily toward the dying wolf. And he wasn't in the least amazed  when his outstretched hands flattened against an unseen barrier. Slowly,  he swept his hands right and left, sure that he was touching the wall of  his cell. Yet his eyes told him he was on a mountain side, and every  sight, sound, and smell was making it real to him.    Puzzled, he thought a moment and then, finding an explanation that  satisfied him, he nodded once and went back to sit at ease on his bunk.  This must be some superior form of TV that included odors, the illusion  of wind, and other fancy touches to make it more vivid. The total effect  was so convincing that Ross had to keep reminding himself that it was  all just a picture.    The wolf was dead. Its pack mates had fled into the brush, but since the  picture remained, Ross decided that the show was not yet over. He could  still hear a click of sound, and he waited for the next bit of action.  But the reason for his viewing it still eluded him.    A man came into view, crossing before Ross. He stooped to examine the  dead wolf, catching it by the tail and hoisting its hindquarters off the  ground. Comparing the beast's size with the hunter's, Ross saw that he  had not been wrong in his estimation of the animal's unusually large  dimensions. The man shouted over his shoulder, his words distinct  enough, but"]]]
