Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#2)"],[1,"bird which the old Indian kings of Mexico let no one wear but their  own selves; and therefore I wear it,--I, John Oxenham of South Tawton,  for a sign to all brave lads of Devon, that as the Spaniards are the  masters of the Indians, we're the masters of the Spaniards:\" and he  replaced his hat.    A murmur of applause followed: but one hinted that he \"doubted the  Spaniards were too many for them.\"    \"Too many? How many men did we take Nombre de Dios with? Seventy-three  were we, and no more when we sailed out of Plymouth Sound; and before we  saw the Spanish Main, half were gastados, used up, as the Dons say, with  the scurvy; and in Port Pheasant Captain Rawse of Cowes fell in with us,  and that gave us some thirty hands more; and with that handful, my lads,  only fifty-three in all, we picked the lock of the new world! And whom  did we lose but our trumpeter, who stood braying like an ass in  the middle of the square, instead of taking care of his neck like a  Christian? I tell you, those Spaniards are rank cowards, as all bullies  are. They pray to a woman, the idolatrous rascals! and no wonder they  fight like women.\"    \"You'm right, captain,\" sang out a tall gaunt fellow who stood close to  him; \"one westcountry-man can fight two easterlings, and an easterling  can beat three Dons any day. Eh! my lads of Devon?         \"For O! it's the herrings and the good brown beef,         And the cider and the cream so white;       O! they are the making of the jolly Devon lads,         For to play, and eke to fight.\"    \"Come,\" said Oxenham, \"come along! Who lists? who lists? who'll make his  fortune?         \"Oh, who will join, jolly mariners all?          And who will join, says he, O!       To fill his pockets with the good red goold,          By sailing on the sea, O!\"    \"Who'll list?\" cried the gaunt man again; \"now's your time! We've got  forty men to Plymouth now, ready to sail the minute we get back, and we  want a dozen out of you Bideford men, and just a boy or two, and then  we'm off and away, and make our fortunes, or go to heaven.         \"Our bodies in the sea so deep,          Our souls in heaven to rest!       Where valiant seamen, one and all,          Hereafter shall be blest!\"    \"Now,\" said Oxenham, \"you won't let the Plymouth men say that the  Bideford men daren't follow them? North Devon against South, it is.  Who'll join? who'll join? It is but a step of a way, after all, and  sailing as smooth as a duck-pond as soon as you're past Cape Finisterre.  I'll run a Clovelly herring-boat there and back for a wager of twenty  pound, and never ship a bucketful all the way. Who'll join? Don't think  you're buying a pig in a poke. I know the road, and Salvation Yeo, here,  too, who was the gunner's mate, as well as I do the narrow seas, and  better. You ask him to show you the chart of it, now, and see if he  don't tell you over the ruttier as well as Drake himself.\"    On which the gaunt man pulled from under his arm a great white buffalo  horn covered with rough etchings of land and sea, and held it up to the  admiring ring.    \"See here, boys all, and behold the pictur of the place, dra'ed out  so natural as ever was life. I got mun from a Portingal, down to the  Azores; and he'd pricked mun out, and pricked mun out, wheresoever he'd  sailed, and whatsoever he'd seen. Take mun in your hands now, Simon  Evans, take mun in your hands; look mun over, and I'll warrant you'll  know the way in five minutes so well as ever a shark in the seas.\"    And the horn was passed from hand to hand; while Oxenham, who saw that  his hearers were becoming moved, called through the open window for  a great tankard of sack, and passed that from hand to hand, after the  horn.    The school-boy, who had been devouring with eyes and ears all which  passed, and had contrived by this time to edge himself into the inner  ring, now stood face to face with the hero of the emerald crest, and got  as many peeps as he could at the wonder. But when he saw the sailors,  one after another, having turned it over a while, come forward and offer  to join Mr. Oxenham, his soul burned within him for a nearer view of  that wondrous horn, as magical in its effects as that of Tristrem, or  the enchanter's in Ariosto; and when the group had somewhat broken up,  and Oxenham was going into the tavern with his recruits, he asked boldly  for a nearer sight of the marvel, which was granted at once.    And now to his astonished gaze displayed themselves cities and harbors,  dragons and elephants, whales which fought with sharks, plate ships  of Spain, islands with apes and palm-trees, each with its name  over-written, and here and there, \"Here is gold;\" and again, \"Much gold  and silver;\" inserted most probably, as the words were in English, by  the hands of Mr. Oxenham himself. Lingeringly and longingly the boy  turned it round and round, and thought the owner of it more fortunate  than Khan or Kaiser. Oh, if he could but possess that horn, what needed  he on earth beside to make him blest!    \"I say, will you sell this?\"    \"Yea, marry, or my own soul, if I can get the worth of it.\"    \"I want the horn,--I don't want your soul; it's somewhat of a stale  sole, for aught I know; and there are plenty of fresh ones in the bay.\"    And therewith, after much fumbling, he pulled out a tester (the only one  he had), and asked if that would buy it?    \"That! no, nor twenty of them.\"    The boy thought over what a good knight-errant would do in such case,  and then answered, \"Tell you what: I'll fight you for it.\"    \"Thank 'ee, sir!    \"Break the jackanapes's head for him, Yeo,\" said Oxenham.    \"Call me jackanapes again, and I break yours, sir.\" And the boy lifted  his fist fiercely.    Oxenham looked at him a minute smilingly. \"Tut! tut! my man, hit one of  your own size, if you will, and spare little folk like me!\"    \"If I have a boy's age, sir, I have a man's fist. I shall be fifteen  years old this month, and know how to answer any one who insults me.\"    \"Fifteen, my young cockerel? you look liker twenty,\" said Oxenham, with  an admiring glance at the lad's broad limbs, keen blue eyes, curling  golden locks, and round honest face. \"Fifteen? If I had half-a-dozen  such lads as you, I would make knights of them before I died. Eh, Yeo?\"    \"He'll do,\" said Yeo; \"he will make a brave gamecock in a year or  two, if he dares ruffle up so early at a tough old hen-master like the  captain.\"    At which there was a general laugh, in which Oxenham joined as loudly as  any, and then bade the lad tell him why he was so keen after the horn.    \"Because,\" said he, looking up boldly, \"I want to go to sea. I want to  see the Indies. I want to fight the Spaniards. Though I am a gentleman's  son, I'd a deal liever be a cabin-boy on board your ship.\" And the lad,  having hurried out his say fiercely enough, dropped his head again.    \"And you shall,\" cried Oxenham, with a great oath; \"and take a galloon,  and dine off carbonadoed Dons. Whose son are you, my gallant fellow?\"    \"Mr. Leigh's, of Burrough Court.\"    \"Bless his soul! I know him as well as I do the Eddystone, and his  kitchen too. Who sups with him to-night?\"    \"Sir Richard Grenville.\"    \"Dick Grenville? I did not know he was in town. Go home and tell your  father John Oxenham will come and keep him company. There, off with you!  I'll make all straight with the good gentleman, and you shall have your  venture with me; and as for the horn, let him have the horn, Yeo, and  I'll give you a noble for it.\"    \"Not a penny, noble captain. If young master will take a poor mariner's  gift, there it is, for the sake of his love to the calling, and  Heaven send him luck therein.\" And the good fellow, with the impulsive  generosity of a true sailor, thrust the horn into the boy's hands, and  walked away to escape thanks.    \"And now,\" quoth Oxenham, \"my merry men all, make up your minds what  mannered men you be minded to be before you take your bounties. I want  none of your rascally lurching longshore vermin, who get five pounds  out of this captain, and ten out of that, and let him sail without them  after all, while they are stowed away under women's mufflers, and  in tavern cellars. If any man is of that humor, he had better to cut  himself up, and salt himself down in a barrel for pork, before he meets  me again; for by this light, let me catch him, be it seven years hence,  and if I do not cut his throat upon the streets, it's a pity! But if any  man will be true brother to me, true brother to him I'll be, come wreck  or prize, storm or calm, salt water or fresh, victuals or none, share  and fare alike; and here's my hand upon it, for every man and all! and  so--         \"Westward ho! with a rumbelow,          And hurra for the Spanish Main, O!\"    After which oration Mr. Oxenham swaggered into the tavern, followed by  his new men; and the boy took his way homewards, nursing his precious  horn, trembling between hope and fear, and blushing with maidenly  shame, and a half-sense of wrong-doing at having revealed suddenly to a  stranger the darling wish which he had hidden from his father and mother  ever since he was ten years old.    Now this young gentleman, Amyas Leigh, though come of as good blood as  any in Devon, and having lived all his life in what we should even  now call the very best society, and being (on account of the valor,  courtesy, and truly noble qualities which he showed forth in his most  eventful life) chosen by me as the hero and centre of this story,  was not, saving for his good looks, by any means what would be called  now-a-days an \"interesting\" youth, still less a \"highly educated\" one;  for, with the exception of a little Latin, which had been driven into  him by repeated blows, as if it had been a nail, he knew no books  whatsoever, save his Bible, his Prayer-book, the old \"Mort d'Arthur\" of  Caxton's edition, which lay in the great bay window in the hall, and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#2)"],[1,"by a desire to make a home for a girl who at the eleventh  hour had declined to share it. Two years had elapsed since then, but  the shadow still lay upon Stuart's life, its influence being revealed  in a certain apathy, almost indifference, which characterised his  professional conduct.    His account of the dream completed, he put the paper into a  pigeon-hole and forgot all about the matter. That day seemed to be  more than usually dull and the hours to drag wearily on. He was  conscious of a sort of suspense. He was waiting for something, or for  someone. He did not choose to analyse this mental condition. Had he  done so, the explanation was simple--and one that he dared not face.    At about ten o'clock that night, having been called out to a case, he  returned to his house, walking straight into the study as was his  custom and casting a light Burberry with a soft hat upon the sofa  beside his stick and bag. The lamps were lighted, and the book-lined  room, indicative of a studious and not over-wealthy bachelor, looked  cheerful enough with the firelight dancing on the furniture.    Mrs. M'Gregor, a grey-haired Scotch lady, attired with scrupulous  neatness, was tending the fire at the moment, and hearing Stuart come  in she turned and glanced at him.    \"A fire is rather superfluous to-night, Mrs. M'Gregor,\" he said. \"I  found it unpleasantly warm walking.\"    \"May is a fearsome treacherous month, Mr. Keppel,\" replied the old  housekeeper, who from long association with the struggling  practitioner had come to regard him as a son. \"An' a wheen o' dry  logs is worth a barrel o' pheesic. To which I would add that if ye're  hintin' it's time ye shed ye're woolsies for ye're summer wear, all I  have to reply is that I hope sincerely ye're patients are more  prudent than yoursel'.\"    She placed his slippers in the fender and took up the hat, stick and  coat from the sofa. Stuart laughed.    \"Most of the neighbors exhibit their wisdom by refraining from  becoming patients of mine, Mrs. M'Gregor.\"    \"That's no weesdom; it's just preejudice.\"  \"Prejudice!\" cried Stuart, dropping down upon the sofa.    \"Aye,\" replied Mrs. M'Gregor firmly--\"preejudice! They're no' that  daft but they're well aware o' who's the cleverest physeecian in the  deestrict, an' they come to nane other than Dr. Keppel Stuart when  they're sair sick and think they're dying; but ye'll never establish  the practice you desairve, Mr. Keppel--never--until--\"    \"Until when, Mrs. M'Gregor?\"    \"Until ye take heed of an auld wife's advice and find a new  housekeeper.\"    \"Mrs. M'Gregor!\" exclaimed Stuart with concern. \"You don't mean that  you want to desert me? After--let me see--how many years is it,  Mrs. M'Gregor?\"    \"Thirty years come last Shrove Tuesday; I dandled ye on my knee, and  eh! but ye were bonny! God forbid, but I'd like to see ye thriving as  ye desairve, and that ye'll never do whilst ye're a bachelor.\"    \"Oh!\" cried Stuart, laughing again--\"oh, that's it, is it? So you  would like me to find some poor inoffensive girl to share my struggles?\"    Mrs. M'Gregor nodded wisely. \"She'd have nane so many to share. I  know ye think I'm old-fashioned, Mr. Keppel and it may be I am; but  I do assure you I would be sair harassed, if stricken to my bed--which,  please God, I won't be--to receive the veesits of a pairsonable young  bachelor--\"    \"Er--Mrs. M'Gregor!\" interrupted Stuart, coughing in mock  rebuke--\"quite so! I fancy we have discussed this point before, and  as you say your ideas are a wee bit, just a wee bit, behind the times.  On this particular point I mean. But I am very grateful to you, very  sincerely grateful, for your disinterested kindness; and if ever I  should follow your advice----\"    Mrs. M'Gregor interrupted him, pointing to his boots. \"Ye're no' that  daft as to sit in wet boots?\"    \"Really they are perfectly dry. Except for a light shower this  evening, there has been no rain for several days. However, I may as  well, since I shall not be going out again.\"    He began to unlace his boots as Mrs. M'Gregor pulled the white  casement curtains across the windows and then prepared to retire. Her  hand upon the door knob, she turned again to Stuart.    \"The foreign lady called half an hour since, Mr. Keppel.\"    Stuart desisted from unlacing his boots and looked up with lively  interest. \"Mlle. Dorian! Did she leave any message?\"    \"She obsairved that she might repeat her veesit later,\" replied  Mrs. M'Gregor, and, after a moment's hesitation; \"she awaited ye're  return with exemplary patience.\"    \"Really, I am sorry I  was detained,\" declared Stuart, replacing his  boot. \"How long has she been gone, then?\"    \"Just the now. No more than two or three minutes. I trust she is no  worse.\"    \"Worse!\"    \"The lass seemed o'er anxious to see you.\"    \"Well, you know, Mrs. M'Gregor, she comes a considerable distance.\"    \"So I am given to understand, Mr. Keppel,\" replied the old lady;  \"and in a grand luxurious car.\"    Stuart assumed an expression of perplexity to hide his embarrassment.  \"Mrs. M'Gregor,\" he said rather ruefully, \"you watch over me as  tenderly as my own mother would have done. I have observed a certain  restraint in your manner whenever you have had occasion to refer to  Mlle. Dorian. In what way does she differ from my other lady  patients?\" And even as he spoke the words he knew in his heart that  she differed from every other woman in the world.    Mrs. M'Gregor sniffed. \"Do your other lady patients wear furs that  your airnings for six months could never pay for, Mr. Keppel?\" she  inquired.    \"No, unfortunately they pin their faith, for the most part, to gaily  coloured shawls. All the more reason why I should bless the accident  which led Mlle. Dorian to my door.\"    Mrs. M'Gregor, betraying, in her interest, real suspicion, murmured  _sotto voce_: \"Then she _is_ a patient?\"    \"What's that?\" asked Stuart, regarding her surprisedly. \"A patient?  Certainly. She suffers from insomnia.\"    \"I'm no' surprised to hear it.\"    \"What do you mean, Mrs. M'Gregor?\"    \"Now, Mr. Keppel, laddie, ye're angry with me, and like enough I am  a meddlesome auld woman. But I know what a man will do for shining  een and a winsome face--nane better to my sorrow--and twa times have  I heard the Warning.\"    Stuart stood up in real perplexity. \"Pardon my density, Mrs.  M'Gregor, but--er--the Warning? To what 'warning' do you refer?\"    Seating herself in the chair before the writing-table, Mrs. M'Gregor  shook her head pensively. \"What would it be,\" she said softly, \"but  the Pibroch o' the M'Gregors?\"    Stuart came across and leaned upon a corner of the table. \"The  Pibroch of the M'Gregors?\" he repeated.    \"Nane other. 'Tis said to be Rob Roy's ain piper that gives warning  when danger threatens ane o' the M'Gregors or any they love.\"    Stuart restrained a smile, and, \"A well-meaning but melancholy  retainer!\" he commented.    \"As well as I hear you now, laddie, I heard the pibroch on the day a  certain woman first crossed my threshold, nigh thirty years ago, in  Inverary. And as plainly as I heard it wailing then, I heard it the  first evening that Miss Dorian came to this house!\"    Torn between good-humoured amusement and real interest, \"If I remember  rightly,\" said Stuart, \"Mlle. Dorian first called here just a week ago,  and immediately before I returned from an Infirmary case?\"    \"Your memory is guid, Mr. Keppel.\"    \"And when, exactly, did you hear this Warning?\"    \"Twa minutes before you entered the house; and I heard it again the  now.\"    \"What! you heard it to-night?\"    \"I heard it again just the now and I lookit out the window.\"    \"Did you obtain a glimpse of Rob Roy's piper?\"    \"Ye're laughing at an old wife, laddie. No, but I saw Miss Dorian away  in her car and twa minutes later I saw yourself coming round the  corner.\"    \"If she had only waited another two minutes,\" murmured Stuart. \"No  matter; she may return. And are these the only occasions upon which  you have heard this mysterious sound, Mrs. M'Gregor?\"    \"No, Master Keppel, they are not. I assure ye something threatens. It  wakened me up in the wee sma' hours last night--the piping--an' I lay  awake shaking for long eno'.\"    \"How extraordinary. Are you sure your imagination is not playing you  tricks?\"    \"Ah, you're no' takin' me seriously, laddie.\"    \"Mrs. M'Gregor\"--he leaned across the table and rested his hands upon  her shoulders--\"you are a second mother to me, your care makes me feel  like a boy again; and in these grey days it's good to feel like a boy  again. You think I am laughing at you, but I'm not. The strange  tradition of your family is associated with a tragedy in your life;  therefore I respect it. But have no fear with regard to Mlle. Dorian.  In the first place she is a patient; in the second--I am merely a  penniless suburban practitioner. Good-night, Mrs. M'Gregor. Don't  think of waiting up. Tell Mary to show Mademoiselle in here directly  she arrives--that is if she really returns.\"    Mrs. M'Gregor stood up and walked slowly to the door. \"I'll show  Mademoiselle in mysel', Mr. Keppel,\" she said,--\"and show her out.\"    She closed the door very quietly.          CHAPTER III    THE SCORPION'S TAIL      Seating himself at the writing-table, Stuart began mechanically to  arrange his papers. Then from the tobacco jar he loaded his pipe,  but his manner remained abstracted. Yet he was not thinking of the  phantom piper but of Mlle. Dorian.    Until he had met this bewilderingly pretty woman he had thought that  his heart was for evermore proof against the glances of bright eyes.  Mademoiselle had disillusioned him. She was the most fragrantly lovely  creature he had ever met, and never for one waking moment since her  first visit, had he succeeded in driving her bewitching image from  his mind. He had tried to laugh at his own folly, then had grown angry  with himself, but finally had settled"]]]
