CHAPTER I.    ITALY.      I am going to tell you next about the most famous nation in the world.  Going westward from Greece another peninsula stretches down into the  Mediterranean. The Apennine Mountains run like a limb stretching out of  the Alps to the south eastward, and on them seems formed that land,  shaped somewhat like a leg, which is called Italy.    Round the streams that flowed down from these hills, valleys of fertile  soil formed themselves, and a great many different tribes and people  took up their abode there, before there was any history to explain their  coming. Putting together what can be proved about them, it is plain,  however, that most of them came of that old stock from which the Greeks  descended, and to which we belong ourselves, and they spoke a language  which had the same root as ours and as the Greek. From one of these  nations the best known form of this, as it was polished in later times,  was called Latin, from the tribe who spoke it.    [Illustration: THE TIBER.]    About the middle of the peninsula there runs down, westward from the  Apennines, a river called the Tiber, flowing rapidly between seven low  hills, which recede as it approaches the sea. One, in especial, called  the Palatine Hill, rose separately, with a flat top and steep sides,  about four hundred yards from the river, and girdled in by the other  six. This was the place where the great Roman power grew up from  beginnings, the truth of which cannot now be discovered.    [Illustration: CURIOUS POTTERY.]    There were several nations living round these hills--the Etruscans,  Sabines, and Latins being the chief. The homes of these nations seem to  have been in the valleys round the spurs of the Apennines, where they  had farms and fed their flocks; but above them was always the hill which  they had fortified as strongly as possible, and where they took refuge  if their enemies attacked them. The Etruscans built very mighty walls,  and also managed the drainage of their cities wonderfully well. Many of  their works remain to this day, and, in especial, their monuments have  been opened, and the tomb of each chief has been found, adorned with  figures of himself, half lying, half sitting; also curious pottery in  red and black, from which something of their lives and ways is to be  made out. They spoke a different language from what has become Latin,  and they had a different religion, believing in one great Soul of the  World, and also thinking much of rewards and punishments after death.  But we know hardly anything about them, except that their chiefs were  called Lucumos, and that they once had a wide power which they had lost  before the time of history. The Romans called them Tusci, and Tuscany  still keeps its name.    The Latins and the Sabines were more alike, and also more like the  Greeks. There were a great many settlements of Greeks in the southern  parts of Italy, and they learnt something from them. They had a great  many gods. Every house had its own guardian. These were called Lares, or  Penates, and were generally represented as little figures of dogs lying  by the hearth, or as brass bars with dogs' heads. This is the reason  that the bars which close in an open hearth are still called dogs.  Whenever there was a meal in the house the master began by pouring out  wine to the Lares, and also to his own ancestors, of whom he kept  figures; for these natives thought much of their families, and all one  family had the same name, like our surname, such as Tullius or Appius,  the daughters only changing it by making it end in _a_ instead of  _us_, and the men having separate names standing first, such as  Marcus or Lucius, though their sisters were only numbered to distinguish  them.    [Illustration: JUPITER]    Each city had a guardian spirit, each stream its nymph, each wood its  faun; also there were gods to whom the boundary stones of estates were  dedicated. There was a goddess of fruits called Pomona, and a god of  fruits named Vertumnus. In their names the fields and the crops were  solemnly blest, and all were sacred to Saturn. He, according to the old  legends, had first taught husbandry, and when he reigned in Italy there  was a golden age, when every one had his own field, lived by his own  handiwork, and kept no slaves. There was a feast in honor of this time  every year called the Saturnalia, when for a few days the slaves were  all allowed to act as if they were free, and have all kinds of wild  sports and merriment. Afterwards, when Greek learning came in, Saturn  was mixed up with the Greek Kronos, or Time, who devours his offspring,  and the reaping-hook his figures used to carry for harvest became Time's  scythe. The sky-god, Zeus or Deus Pater (or father), was shortened into  Jupiter; Juno was his wife, and Mars was god of war, and in Greek times  was supposed to be the same as Ares; Pallas Athene was joined with the  Latin Minerva; Hestia, the goddess of the hearth, was called Vesta; and,  in truth, we talk of the Greek gods by their Latin names. The old Greek  tales were not known to the Latins in their first times, but only  afterwards learnt from the Greeks. They seem to have thought of their  gods as graver, higher beings, further off, and less capricious and  fanciful than the legends about the weather had made them seem to the  Greeks. Indeed, these Latins were a harder, tougher, graver, fiercer,  more business-like race altogether than the Greeks; not so clever,  thoughtful, or poetical, but with more of what we should now call  sterling stuff in them.    At least so it was with that great nation which spoke their language,  and seems to have been an offshoot from them. Rome, the name of which is  said to mean the famous, is thought to have been at first a cluster of  little villages, with forts to protect them on the hills, and temples in  the forts. Jupiter had a temple on the Capitoline Hill, with cells for  his worship, and that of Juno and Minerva; and the two-faced Janus, the  god of gates, had his upon the Janicular Hill. Besides these, there were  the Palatine, the Esquiline, the Aventine, the Caelian, and the Quirinal.  The people of these villages called themselves Quirites, or spearmen,  when they formed themselves into an army and made war on their  neighbors, the Sabines and Latins, and by-and-by built a wall enclosing  all the seven hills, and with a strip of ground within, free from  houses, where sacrifices were offered and omens sought for.    The history of these people was not written till long after they had  grown to be a mighty and terrible"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16672"],[0,"The Last Journals of David Livingstone, in Central Africa, from 1865 to His (#2)"],[1,"celebrated journey across Africa, and this finally sapped his vital  powers, and, through the irritation of exhaustion, insidiously clouded  much of his happiness.    Many of his old friends were filled with anxiety when they found that  he intended to continue the investigation of the Nile sources, for the  letters sent home by Mr. Stanley raised the liveliest apprehensions,  which, alas! soon proved themselves well grounded.    The reader must be warned that, however versed in books of African  travel he may be, the very novelty of his situation amongst these  pages will render him liable perhaps to a danger which a timely word  may avert. Truly it may be said he has an _embarras de richesses!_ To  follow an explorer who by his individual exertions has filled up a  great space in the map of Africa, who has not only been the first to  set foot on the shores of vast inland seas, but who, with the simple  appliances of his bodily stature for a sounding pole and his stalwart  stride for a measuring tape, lays down new rivers by the hundreds, is  a task calculated to stagger him. It may be provoking to find  Livingstone busily engaged in bargaining for a canoe upon the shores  of Bangweolo, much as he would have secured a boat on his own native  Clyde; but it was not in his nature to be subject to those paroxysms  in which travellers too often indite their discoveries and  descriptions.    At the same time these journals will be found to contain innumerable  notes on the habits of animals, birds, and fishes, many of them  probably new species, and on phenomena in every direction which the  keen eye searched out as the great traveller moved amongst some of the  grandest scenes of this beautiful world: it may be doubted if ever eye  so keen was backed by so much perseverance to shield it from a mere  superficial habit of noticing. Let his adventures speak for  themselves.    Amongst the greatest facts recorded here the Geographer will perceive  that the Doctor has placed it beyond doubt that Lake Nyassa belongs to  a totally distinct system of waters to that which holds Lake  Tanganyika, and the rivers running north and west. He was too  sagacious to venture the surmise that Tanganyika has a subterranean  outlet without having duly weighed the probabilities in the scale with  his elaborate observations: the idea gathers force when we remember  that in the case of limestone cliffs, water so often succeeds in  breaking bounds by boring through the solid rock. No more interesting  problem is left to solve, and we shall yet learn whether, through the  caverns of Western Kabogo, this Lake adds its waters to the vast  northerly flow of rivers we now read of for the first time, and which  are undoubtedly amongst the largest in the world.    I cannot close these remarks without stating how much obliged I am to  Mr. James Young, F.R.S., of Kelly, for having ensured the presence of  the Doctor's men, Chuma and Susi. Ever ready to serve his old friend  Livingstone, he took care that they should be at my elbow so long as I  required them to help me amidst the pile of MSS. and maps. Their  knowledge of the countries they travelled in is most remarkable, and  from constantly aiding their master by putting questions to the  natives respecting the course of rivers, &c., I found them actual  geographers of no mean attainments. In one instance, when in doubt  concerning a particular watershed, to my surprise Susi returned a few  hours afterwards with a plan of the whole system of rivers in the  region under examination, and I found his sketch tally well with the  Doctor's map. Known to me previously for years on the Zambesi and  Shire it was a pleasure to have them with me for four months. Amongst  other good services they have aided the artist by reproducing the  exact facsimile of the hut in which Dr. Livingstone expired, besides  making models of the \"kitanda\" on which he was carried, and of the  village in which his body lay for fourteen days.    I need not add what ready and valuable assistance I have derived from  the Doctor's old companion Dr. Kirk wherever I have found it necessary  to apply to him; some of the illustrations are more particularly owing  to his kindness.    It only remains to say that it has been thought advisable to retain  all the strictly scientific matter found in Dr. Livingstone's journals  for future publication. When one sees that a register of the daily  rainfall was kept throughout, that the temperature was continually  recorded, and that barometrical and hypsometrical observations were  made with unflagging thoroughness of purpose year in and year out, it  is obvious that an accumulated mass of information remains for the  meteorologist to deal with separately, which alone must engross many  months of labour.    A constant sense of great responsibility has been mine throughout this  task, for one cannot doubt that much of the future welfare of distant  tribes and races depends upon Livingstone obtaining through these  records a distinct hearing for their woes, their misery, and above all  for their willingness to welcome men drawn towards them by motives  like his.    At the same time memory and affection have not failed to bring back  vividly the man, the traveller, and the friend. May that which he has  said in his journals suffer neither loss of interest nor depth of  meaning at the compiler's hands.        HORACE WALLER.
