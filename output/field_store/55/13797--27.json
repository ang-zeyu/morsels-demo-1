On many occasions I was called upon to preside at  concerts, lectures, etc., not only amongst the saloon passengers, but  also in the third class cabin. A rough voyage across the Bay of Biscay,  a view of the Tagus, a brief run on shore to look at the picturesque  capital of Portugal, a gaze at the spot, which marks the memory of the  scene of the fearful earthquake of 1755, which destroyed most of the  town, and 50,000 of its inhabitants; a short stay at the lovely island  of Madeira, sufficient to glance at its beautiful scenery, to breathe  its balmy air, to taste its delicious fruits, and to land at its pretty  town of Funchal, to see some of its charming surroundings; a passing  peep at Teneriffe, which is now receiving so much attention in Europe as  an attractive health resort; a few days' run of exhausting heat through  the tropics; a visit to Saint Helena, enough to allow of a drive to  Longwood, and a look at the room, where the first Napoleon breathed his  last--leaving there the legacy of the shadow of a mighty name to all  time--on this \"lonely rock in the Atlantic\"; a few days more of solitary  sailing over a stormy sea, a daily look-out for whales, porpoises,  dolphins, flying fish, sharks, and albatrosses; a glance upward, night  after night, into the starry sky, to gaze on the Southern Cross, so much  belauded, and yet so disappointing in its appearance, after the  extravagant encomiums lavished on it; and at length, on the early  morning of May 24, I safely reached Cape Town.    [Illustration: Decorative]          [Illustration: Decorative]    CAPE TOWN.      To produce the most favourable impression of any new place, it is  essential that it should be seen for the first time in fine weather.  Places look so very different under a canopy of cloud, and, perhaps, a  deluge of rain, or when they are bathed in the sunshine of a beautiful  day. Happily for me, my first view of Cape Town was under the latter  genial aspect. I need scarcely say, that I was, in consequence, quite  charmed with my first sight of this celebrated town, the seat of  Government of the Cape Colony. What made the scene more than usually  striking to a traveller, fresh from the sea, was, that it was the  Queen's birthday, and the day dawned with a most perfect specimen of  \"Queen's weather.\" Cape Town was literally _en fete_. The inhabitants  thronged the streets. I was astonished at the great variety of gay  costumes among the motley crowd--English, Dutch, Germans and French,  Malays, Indian Coolies, Kafirs, and Hottentots--a tremendous gathering,  in fact, of all nations, and \"all sorts and conditions of men.\" There  was a grand review of all the military branches of the Service, in which  His Excellency the Administrator, General Smyth, surrounded by a  brilliant staff, received the homage due to the British flag; and, as  her representative on this occasion, to Her Majesty's honoured name. The  review was followed by a regatta in the afternoon. It was quite  refreshing to a new arrival, like myself, to observe the enthusiastic  evidences of loyal feeling everywhere exhibited in the capital of the  Colony to our Queen, the beloved and venerated head of the British  Empire.    [Illustration: GOVERNMENT HOUSE, CAPE TOWN.]    Before commencing my long and interesting tour \"up country,\" I spent a  few most pleasant, days at Cape Town. My impressions of it, and of its  beautiful surroundings, could not fail to be most favourable. The  panoramic view of its approach from Table Bay, at the foot of Table  Mountain, is very fine. The town itself appeared to me much cleaner, and  brighter than I expected to see it, although, it must be admitted, there  is still considerable room for improvement in its sanitary arrangements,  and also in the accommodation, and condition of its hotels, to make them  as attractive as they ought to be. The best of them do not come at all  up to our standard at home, nor to our English ideas of comfort and  convenience. A great improvement in these respects, I am satisfied, is  not only necessary, but would pay well, and induce a far larger number  of visitors to stay at Cape Town, and avail themselves of its  attractions of climate, and fine surroundings.    While I was at Cape Town, I visited among other places, the House of  Parliament, the Observatory, the South African Museum, the Public  Library, the Botanic Gardens, &c.    [Illustration: PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CAPE TOWN.]    The House of Parliament, which was opened for public use in 1885, is a  very handsome building, having a frontage of 264 feet, and is divided  into a central portico, leading into the grand vestibule, the two  debating chambers, and side pavilions. The portico, which is of massive  dimensions, is approached by a commanding flight of granite steps, which  runs round three sides of it. The pavilions are relieved by groups of  pilasters with Corinthian capitals, and are surmounted by domes and  ventilators. The whole of the ground floor up to the level of the main  floor has been built of Paarl granite, which is obtained from the  neighbouring district of that name. The upper part of the building is of  red brick, relieved by pilasters and window dressing of Portland cement,  the effect being very pleasing to the eye. The interior accommodation  for the business of the two Legislative bodies is most complete, and  arranged with a careful view to comfort and convenience. In addition to  the Debating Chambers, which are sixty-seven feet in length by  thirty-six feet in width, there is a lofty hall of stately appearance,  with marble pillars, and tesselated pavement, which forms the central  lobby, or grand vestibule. I might mention, that the debating chambers  are only ten feet in length and width less than the British House of  Commons. Adjoining the central lobby is the parliamentary library, a  large apartment, with galleries above each other reaching to the full  height of the building. The usual refreshment, luncheon, and smoking  rooms have not been forgotten, in connection with the comfort of the  members. The public are accommodated in roomy galleries, and ample  provision has been made for ladies, distinguished visitors, and the  press. The portrait of Her Majesty, and the Mace at the table reminds  one forcibly of the fact that one is still in a portion of the British  Empire. The total cost of the building, including furniture, was  L220,000.    I attended two or three debates in the House of Parliament, and was much  impressed with the manner in which, in this superb and commodious  legislative chamber, the discussions were carried on. There was a quiet  dignity of debate, as well as business-like capacity and orderly tone,  observed on both sides of the House, which might be copied with  advantage, as it is in striking contrast to much of the practice, in the  Parliament of Great Britain. It is certainly satisfactory to notice,  that the modern manners and customs, in the popular branch of our own  ancient national assembly, which so frequently fail in orthodox  propriety, have not been imitated in the Cape Colony.    At the Record Office attached to the House of Parliament, I went into  the vaults, and inspected the early manuscripts of the Dutch, during  their original occupation of the Cape of Good Hope. These are most  deeply and historically interesting, and valuable. The minute accuracy,  with which every incident is recorded is most remarkable. There are bays  in these vaults, filled with records, which must be of priceless value  to an historical student, and they are now in course of arrangement by  the able librarian, Mr. H.C.V. Leibbrandt, who is the author of a most  interesting work entitled \"Rambles through the Archives of the Colony of  the Cape of Good Hope.\"[A]    At the South African Museum I found a valuable collection of beasts,  birds, fishes, &c., not only from South Africa, but from various parts  of the world. The collection has been enriched by valuable contributions  from Mr. Selous, the distinguished African traveller, and sportsman, his  donations consisting chiefly of big game, including two gigantic elands,  (male and female), buffaloes, antelopes, &c. The series of birds  comprises the large number of two thousand species.    A visit of great interest to me was to the South African Public Library,  which boasts of about 50,000 volumes, and embraces every branch of  science and literature. It contains three distinct collections, viz.,  the Dessinian, the Grey, and the Porter. The first-named was bequeathed  to the Colony in 1761 by Mr. Joachim Nicholas Von Dessin, and consists  of books, manuscripts and paintings. The Porter collection took its name  from the Hon. William Porter, and was purchased from the subscriptions  raised for the purpose of procuring a life-size portrait of that  gentleman, in recognition of his services to the Colony. As, however,  Mr. Porter declined to sit for his portrait, the amount subscribed was  appropriated to the purchase of standard works, to be known as the  Porter Collection. By far the most valuable, however, is the Grey  Collection, numbering about 5,000 volumes, and occupying a separate  room. These were presented by Sir George Grey, Governor of the Cape  Colony from 1854 to 1859, and still an active member of the New Zealand  House of Representatives. Here are many rare manuscripts, mostly on  vellum or parchment, some of them of the tenth century, in addition to a  unique collection of works relating to South Africa generally.    Among the places of worship in Cape Town the most important are St.  George's Cathedral, which was built in 1830, and is of Grecian style"]]]
