K. had made no sign nor waved his magic baton. So I just kept as  cool as I could and had a sound sleep.    Next morning, that is the 12th instant, I was working at the Horse  Guards when, about 10 a.m., K. sent for me. I wondered! Opening the door  I bade him good morning and walked up to his desk where he went on  writing like a graven image. After a moment, he looked up and said in a  matter-of-fact tone, \"We are sending a military force to support the  Fleet now at the Dardanelles, and you are to have Command.\"    Something in voice or words touched a chord in my memory. We were once  more standing, K. and I, in our workroom at Pretoria, having just  finished reading the night's crop of sixty or seventy wires. K. was  saying to me, \"You had better go out to the Western Transvaal.\" I asked  no question, packed up my kit, ordered my train, started that night. Not  another syllable was said on the subject. Uninstructed and unaccredited  I left that night for the front; my outfit one A.D.C., two horses, two  mules and a buggy. Whether I inspected the columns and came back and  reported to K. in my capacity as his Chief Staff Officer; or, whether,  making use of my rank to assume command in the field, I beat up de la  Rey in his den--all this rested entirely with me.    So I made my choice and fought my fight at Roodewal, last strange battle  in the West. That is K.'s way. The envoy goes forth; does his best with  whatever forces he can muster and, if he loses;--well, unless he had  liked the job he should not have taken it on.    At that moment K. wished me to bow, leave the room and make a start as I  did some thirteen years ago. But the conditions were no longer the same.  In those old Pretoria days I had known the Transvaal by heart; the  number, value and disposition of the British forces; the characters of  the Boer leaders; the nature of the country. But my knowledge of the  Dardanelles was nil; of the Turk nil; of the strength of our own forces  next to nil. Although I have met K. almost every day during the past six  months, and although he has twice hinted I might be sent to Salonika;  never once, to the best of my recollection, had he mentioned the word  Dardanelles.    I had plenty of time for these reflections as K., after his one  tremendous remark had resumed his writing at the desk. At last, he  looked up and inquired, \"Well?\"    \"We have done this sort of thing before, Lord K.\" I said; \"we have run  this sort of show before and you know without saying I am most deeply  grateful and you know without saying I will do my best and that you can  trust my loyalty--but I must say something--I must ask you some  questions.\" Then I began.    K. frowned; shrugged his shoulders; I thought he was going to be  impatient, but although he gave curt answers at first he slowly  broadened out, until, at the end, no one else could get a word in  edgeways.[3]    My troops were to be Australians and New Zealanders under Birdwood (a  friend); strength, say, about 30,000. (A year ago I inspected them in  their own Antipodes and no finer material exists); the 29th Division,  strength, say 19,000 under Hunter-Weston--a slashing man of action; an  acute theorist; the Royal Naval Division, 11,000 strong (an excellent  type of Officer and man, under a solid Commander--Paris); a French  contingent, strength at present uncertain, say, about a Division, under  my old war comrade the chivalrous d'Amade, now at Tunis.    Say then grand total about 80,000--probably panning out at some 50,000  rifles in the firing line. Of these the 29th Division are  extras--_division de luxe._    K. went on; he was now fairly under weigh and got up and walked about  the room as he spoke. I knew, he said, his (K.'s) feelings as to the  political and strategic value of the Near East where one clever tactical  thrust delivered on the spot and at the spot might rally the wavering  Balkans. Rifle for rifle, _at that moment_, we could nowhere make as  good use of the 29th Division as by sending it to the Dardanelles, where  each of its 13,000 rifles might attract a hundred more to our side of  the war. Employed in France or Flanders the 29th would at best help to  push back the German line a few miles; at the Dardanelles the stakes  were enormous. He spoke, so it struck me, as if he was defending himself  in argument: he asked if I agreed. I said, \"Yes.\" \"Well,\" he rejoined,  \"You may just as well realize at once that G.H.Q. in France do not  agree. They think they have only to drive the Germans back fifty miles  nearer to their base to win the war. Those are the same fellows who used  to write me saying they wanted no New Army; that they would be amply  content if only the old Old Army and the Territorials could be kept up  to strength. Now they've been down to Aldershot and seen the New Army  they are changing their tune, but I am by no means sure, _now_, that  I'll give it to them. French and his Staff believe firmly that the  British Imperial Armies can pitch their camp down in one corner of  Europe and there fight a world war to a finish. The thing is absurd but  French, plus France, are a strong combine and they are fighting tooth  and nail for the 29th Division. It must clearly be understood then:--\"    (1) That the 29th Division are only to be a loan and are to be returned  the moment they can be spared.    (2) That all things ear-marked for the East are looked on by powerful  interests both at home and in France as having been stolen from the  West.    Did I take this in? I said, \"I take it from you.\" Did I myself, speaking  as actual Commander of the Central Striking Force and executively  responsible for the land defence of England, think the 29th Division  could be spared at all? \"Yes,\" I said, \"and four more Territorial  Divisions as well.\" K. used two or three very bad words and added, with  his usual affability, that I would find myself walking about in civilian  costume instead of going to Constantinople if he found me making any  wild statements of that sort to the politicians. I laughed and reminded  him of my testimony before the Committee of Imperial Defence about my  Malta amphibious manoeuvres; about the Malta Submarines and the way  they had destroyed the battleships conveying my landing forces. If there  was any politician, I said, who cared a hang about my opinions he knew  quite well already my views on an invasion of England; namely, that it  would be like trying to hurt a monkey by throwing nuts at him. I didn't  want to steal what French wanted, but now that the rifles had come and  the troops had finished their musketry, there was no need to squabble  over a Division. Why not let French have two of my Central Force  Territorial Division at once,--they were jolly good and were wasting  their time over here. That would sweeten French and he and Joffre would  make no more trouble about the 29th.    K. glared at me. I don't know what he was going to say when Callwell  came into the room with some papers.    We moved to the map in the window and Callwell took us through a plan of  attack upon the Forts at the Dardanelles, worked out by the Greek  General Staff. The Greeks had meant to employ (as far as I can remember)  150,000 men. Their landing was to have taken place on the North-west  coast of the Southern part of the Peninsula, opposite Kilid Bahr. \"But,\"  said K., \"half that number of men will do you handsomely; the Turks are  busy elsewhere; I hope you will not have to land at all; if you _do_  have to land, why then the powerful Fleet at your back will be the prime  factor in your choice of time and place.\"    I asked K. if he would not move the Admiralty to work a submarine or two  up the Straits at once so as to prevent reinforcements and supplies  coming down by sea from Constantinople. By now the Turks must be on the  alert and it was commonsense to suppose they would be sending some sort  of help to their Forts. However things might pan out we could not be  going wrong if we made the Marmora unhealthy for the Turkish ships. Lord  K. thereupon made the remark that if we could get"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19322"],[0,"The Antichrist (#2)"],[1," daresay, of the Kaiser,  and perhaps to the even greater horror of Nietzsche's own ghost. The  folks of Anglo-Saxondom, with their equally characteristic tendency to  explain all their enterprises romantically, simultaneously set him up as  the Antichrist he no doubt secretly longed to be. The result was a great  deal of misrepresentation and misunderstanding of him. From the pulpits  of the allied countries, and particularly from those of England and the  United States, a horde of patriotic ecclesiastics denounced him in  extravagant terms as the author of all the horrors of the time, and in  the newspapers, until the Kaiser was elected sole bugaboo, he shared the  honors of that office with von Hindenburg, the Crown Prince, Capt.  Boy-Ed, von Bernstorff and von Tirpitz. Most of this denunciation, of  course, was frankly idiotic--the naive pishposh of suburban Methodists,  notoriety-seeking college professors, almost illiterate editorial  writers, and other such numskulls. In much of it, including not a few  official hymns of hate, Nietzsche was gravely discovered to be the  teacher of such spokesmen of the extremest sort of German nationalism  as von Bernhardi and von Treitschke--which was just as intelligent as  making George Bernard Shaw the mentor of Lloyd-George. In other solemn  pronunciamentoes he was credited with being philosophically responsible  for various imaginary crimes of the enemy--the wholesale slaughter or  mutilation of prisoners of war, the deliberate burning down of Red Cross  hospitals, the utilization of the corpses of the slain for soap-making.  I amused myself, in those gaudy days, by collecting newspaper clippings  to this general effect, and later on I shall probably publish a digest  of them, as a contribution to the study of war hysteria. The thing went  to unbelievable lengths. On the strength of the fact that I had  published a book on Nietzsche in 1906, six years after his death, I was  called upon by agents of the Department of Justice, elaborately  outfitted with badges, to meet the charge that I was an intimate  associate and agent of \"the German monster, Nietzsky.\" I quote the  official _proces verbal_, an indignant but often misspelled document.  Alas, poor Nietzsche! After all his laborious efforts to prove that he  was not a German, but a Pole--even after his heroic readiness, via  anti-anti-Semitism, to meet the deduction that, if a Pole, then probably  also a Jew!    But under all this alarmed and preposterous tosh there was at least a  sound instinct, and that was the instinct which recognized Nietzsche as  the most eloquent, pertinacious and effective of all the critics of the  philosophy to which the Allies against Germany stood committed, and on  the strength of which, at all events in theory, the United States had  engaged itself in the war. He was not, in point of fact, involved with  the visible enemy, save in remote and transient ways; the German,  officially, remained the most ardent of Christians during the war and  became a democrat at its close. But he was plainly a foe of democracy in  all its forms, political, religious and epistemological, and what is  worse, his opposition was set forth in terms that were not only  extraordinarily penetrating and devastating, but also uncommonly  offensive. It was thus quite natural that he should have aroused a  degree of indignation verging upon the pathological in the two countries  that had planted themselves upon the democratic platform most boldly,  and that felt it most shaky, one may add, under their feet. I daresay  that Nietzsche, had he been alive, would have got a lot of satisfaction  out of the execration thus heaped upon him, not only because, being a  vain fellow, he enjoyed execration as a tribute to his general  singularity, and hence to his superiority, but also and more importantly  because, being no mean psychologist, he would have recognized the  disconcerting doubts underlying it. If Nietzsche's criticism of  democracy were as ignorant and empty, say, as the average evangelical  clergyman's criticism of Darwin's hypothesis of natural selection, then  the advocates of democracy could afford to dismiss it as loftily as the  Darwinians dismiss the blather of the holy clerks. And if his attack  upon Christianity were mere sound and fury, signifying nothing, then  there would be no call for anathemas from the sacred desk. But these  onslaughts, in point of fact, have behind them a tremendous learning and  a great deal of point and plausibility--there are, in brief, bullets in  the gun, teeth in the tiger,--and so it is no wonder that they excite  the ire of men who hold, as a primary article of belief, that their  acceptance would destroy civilization, darken the sun, and bring Jahveh  to sobs upon His Throne.    But in all this justifiable fear, of course, there remains a false  assumption, and that is the assumption that Nietzsche proposed to  destroy Christianity altogether, and so rob the plain people of the  world of their virtue, their spiritual consolations, and their hope of  heaven. Nothing could be more untrue. The fact is that Nietzsche had no  interest whatever in the delusions of the plain people--that is,  intrinsically. It seemed to him of small moment _what_ they believed, so  long as it was safely imbecile. What he stood against was not their  beliefs, but the elevation of those beliefs, by any sort of democratic  process, to the dignity of a state philosophy--what he feared most was  the pollution and crippling of the superior minority by intellectual  disease from below. His plain aim in \"The Antichrist\" was to combat that  menace by completing the work begun, on the one hand, by Darwin and the  other evolutionist philosophers, and, on the other hand, by German  historians and philologians. The net effect of this earlier attack, in  the eighties, had been the collapse of Christian theology as a serious  concern of educated men. The mob, it must be obvious, was very little  shaken; even to this day it has not put off its belief in the essential  Christian doctrines. But the _intelligentsia_, by 1885, had been pretty  well convinced. No man of sound information, at the time Nietzsche  planned \"The Antichrist,\" actually believed that the world was created  in seven days, or that its fauna was once overwhelmed by a flood as a  penalty for the sins of man, or that Noah saved the boa constrictor, the  prairie dog and the _pediculus capitis_ by taking a pair of each into  the ark, or that Lot's wife was turned into a pillar of salt, or that a  fragment of the True Cross could cure hydrophobia. Such notions, still  almost universally prevalent in Christendom a century before, were now  confined to the great body of ignorant and credulous men--that is, to  ninety-five or ninety-six percent. of the race. For a man of the  superior minority to subscribe to one of them publicly was already  sufficient to set him off as one in imminent need of psychiatrical  attention. Belief in them had become a mark of inferiority, like the  allied belief in madstones, magic and apparitions.    But though the theology of Christianity had thus sunk to the lowly  estate of a mere delusion of the rabble, propagated on that level by the  ancient caste of sacerdotal parasites, the ethics of Christianity  continued to enjoy the utmost acceptance, and perhaps even more  acceptance than ever before. It seemed to be generally felt, in fact,  that they simply _must_ be saved from the wreck--that the world would  vanish into chaos if they went the way of the revelations supporting  them. In this fear a great many judicious men joined, and so there arose  what was, in essence, an absolutely new Christian cult--a cult, to wit,  purged of all the supernaturalism superimposed upon the older cult by  generations of theologians, and harking back to what was conceived to be  the pure ethical doctrine of Jesus. This cult still flourishes;  Protestantism tends to become identical with it; it invades Catholicism  as Modernism; it is supported by great numbers of men whose intelligence  is manifest and whose sincerity is not open to question. Even Nietzsche  himself yielded to it in weak moments, as you will discover on examining  his somewhat laborious effort to make Paul the villain of Christian  theology, and Jesus no more than an innocent bystander. But this  sentimental yielding never went far enough to distract his attention for  long from his main idea, which was this: that Christian ethics were  quite as dubious, at bottom, as Christian theology--that they were  founded, just as surely as such childish fables as the story of Jonah  and the whale, upon the peculiar prejudices and credulities, the special  desires and appetites, of inferior men--that they warred upon the best  interests of men of a better sort quite as unmistakably as the most  extravagant of objective superstitions. In brief, what he saw in  Christian ethics, under all the poetry and all the fine show of altruism  and all the theoretical benefits therein, was a democratic effort to  curb the egoism of the strong--a conspiracy of the _chandala_ against  the free functioning of their superiors, nay, against the free progress  of mankind. This theory is the thing he exposes in \"The Antichrist,\"  bringing to the business his amazingly chromatic and exigent eloquence  at its finest flower. This is the \"conspiracy\" he sets forth in all the  panoply of his characteristic italics, dashes, _sforzando_ interjections  and exclamation points.    Well, an idea is an idea. The present one may be right and it may be  wrong. One thing is quite certain: that no progress will be made against  it by denouncing it as merely immoral. If it is ever laid at all, it  must be laid evidentially, logically. The notion to the contrary is  thoroughly democratic; the mob is the most ruthless of tyrants; it is  always in a democratic society that heresy and felony tend to be most"]]]
