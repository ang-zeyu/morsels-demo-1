CLXXXIV - Since Thou hast, O my God, established Thyself...              I: \"GLORIFIED ART THOU, O LORD MY GOD! EVERY MAN...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Every man of insight confesseth Thy  sovereignty and Thy dominion, and every discerning eye perceiveth the  greatness of Thy majesty and the compelling power of Thy might. The winds  of tests are powerless to hold back them that enjoy near access to Thee  from setting their faces towards the horizon of Thy glory, and the  tempests of trials must fail to draw away and hinder such as are wholly  devoted to Thy will from approaching Thy court.    Methinks, the lamp of Thy love is burning in their hearts, and the light  of Thy tenderness is lit within their breasts. Adversities are incapable  of estranging them from Thy Cause, and the vicissitudes of fortune can  never cause them to stray from Thy pleasure.    I beseech Thee, O my God, by them and by the sighs which their hearts  utter in their separation from Thee, to keep them safe from the mischief  of Thine adversaries, and to nourish their souls with what Thou hast  ordained for Thy loved ones on whom shall come no fear and who shall not  be put to grief.            II: \"UNTO THEE BE PRAISE, O LORD MY GOD! I ENTREAT...\"      Unto Thee be praise, O Lord my God! I entreat Thee, by Thy signs that have  encompassed the entire creation, and by the light of Thy countenance that  hath illuminated all that are in heaven and on earth, and by Thy mercy  that hath surpassed all created things, and by Thy grace that hath  suffused the whole universe, to rend asunder the veils that shut me out  from Thee, that I may hasten unto the Fountain-Head of Thy mighty  inspiration, and to the Day-Spring of Thy Revelation and bountiful favors,  and may be immersed beneath the ocean of Thy nearness and pleasure.    Suffer me not, O my Lord, to be deprived of the knowledge of Thee in Thy  days, and divest me not of the robe of Thy guidance. Give me to drink of  the river that is life indeed, whose waters have streamed forth from the  Paradise (Ridvan) in which the throne of Thy Name, the All-Merciful, was  established, that mine eyes may be opened, and my face be illumined, and  my heart be assured, and my soul be enlightened, and my steps be made  firm.    Thou art He Who from everlasting was, through the potency of His might,  supreme over all things, and, through the operation of His will, was able  to ordain all things. Nothing whatsoever, whether in Thy heaven or on Thy  earth, can frustrate Thy purpose. Have mercy, then, upon me, O my Lord,  through Thy gracious providence and generosity, and incline mine ear to  the sweet melodies of the birds that warble their praise of Thee, amidst  the branches of the tree of Thy oneness.    Thou art the Great Giver, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate.            III: \"GLORIFIED ART THOU, O LORD MY GOD! I BESEECH...\"      Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Him Who is Thy Most  Great Name, Who hath been sorely afflicted by such of Thy creatures as  have repudiated Thy truth, and Who hath been hemmed in by sorrows which no  tongue can describe, to grant that I may remember Thee and celebrate Thy  praise, in these days when all have turned away from Thy beauty, have  disputed with Thee, and turned away disdainfully from Him Who is the  Revealer of Thy Cause. None is there, O my Lord, to help Thee except Thine  own Self, and no power to succor Thee save Thine own power.    I entreat Thee to enable me to cleave steadfastly to Thy Love and Thy  remembrance. This is, verily, within my power, and Thou art the One that  knoweth all that is in me. Thou, in truth, art knowing, apprised of all.  Deprive me not, O my Lord, of the splendors of the light of Thy face,  whose brightness hath illuminated the whole world. No God is there beside  Thee, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Forgiving.            IV: \"MAGNIFIED BE THY NAME, O LORD MY GOD! THOU ART...\"      Magnified be Thy name, O Lord my God! Thou art He Whom all things worship  and Who worshipeth no one, Who is the Lord of all things and is the vassal  of none, Who knoweth all things and is known of none. Thou didst wish to  make Thyself known unto men; therefore, Thou didst, through a word of Thy  mouth, bring creation into being and fashion the universe. There is none  other God except Thee, the Fashioner, the Creator, the Almighty, the Most  Powerful.    I implore Thee, by this very word that hath shone forth above the horizon  of Thy will, to enable me to drink deep of the living waters through which  Thou hast vivified the hearts of Thy chosen ones and quickened the souls  of them that love Thee, that I may, at all times and under all conditions,  turn my face wholly towards Thee.    Thou art the God of power, of glory and bounty. No God is there beside  Thee, the Supreme Ruler, the All-Glorious, the Omniscient.            V: \"LAUDED BE THY NAME, O MY GOD! THOU BEHOLDEST...\"      Lauded be Thy name, O my God! Thou beholdest me in the clutches of my  oppressors. Every time I turn to my right, I hear the voice of the  lamentation of them that are dear to Thee, whom the infidels have made  captives for having believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and for having set  their faces towards the horizon of Thy grace and of Thy loving-kindness.  And when I turn to my left, I hear the clamor of the wicked doers who have  disbelieved in Thee and in Thy signs, and persistently striven to put out  the light of Thy lamp which sheddeth the radiance of Thine own Self over  all that are in Thy heaven and all that are on Thy earth.    The hearts of Thy chosen ones, O my Lord, have melted because of their  separation from Thee, and the souls of Thy loved ones are burnt up by the  fire of their yearning after Thee in Thy days. I implore Thee, O Thou  Maker of the heavens and Lord of all names, by Thy most effulgent Self and  Thy most exalted and all-glorious Remembrance, to send down upon Thy loved  ones that which will draw them nearer unto Thee, and enable them to  hearken unto Thine utterances.    Tear asunder with the hand of Thy transcendent power, O my Lord, the veil  of vain imaginings, that they who are wholly devoted to Thee may see Thee  seated on the throne of Thy majesty, and the eyes of such as adore Thy  unity may rejoice at the splendors of the glory of Thy face. The doors of  hope have been shut against the hearts that long for Thee, O my Lord!  Their keys are in Thy hands; open them by the power of Thy might and Thy  sovereignty. Potent art Thou to do as Thou pleasest. Thou art, verily, the  Almighty, the Beneficent.            VI: \"PRAISE BE TO THEE, O LORD MY GOD! I SWEAR BY THY...\"      Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God! I swear by Thy might! Successive  afflictions have withheld the pen of the Most High from laying bare that  which is hidden from the eyes of Thy creatures, and incessant trials have  hindered the tongue of the Divine Ordainer from proclaiming the wonders of  Thy glorification and praise. With a stammering tongue, therefore, I call  upon Thee, O my God, and with this my afflicted pen I occupy myself in  remembrance of Thy name.    Is there any man of insight, O my God, that can behold Thee with Thine own  eye, and where is the thirsty one who can direct his face towards the  living waters of Thy love? I am the one, O my God, who hath blotted out  from his heart the remembrance of all except Thee, and hath graven upon it  the mysteries of Thy love. Thine own might beareth me witness! But for  tribulations, how could the assured be distinguished from the doubters  among Thy servants? They who have been inebriated with the wine of Thy  knowledge, these, verily, hasten to meet every manner of adversity in  their longing to pass into Thy presence. I implore Thee, O Beloved of my  heart and the Object of my soul's adoration, to shield them that love me  from the faintest trace of evil and corrupt desires. Supply them, then,  with the good of this world and of the next.    Thou art, verily, He Whose grace hath guided them aright, He Who hath  declared Himself to be the All-Merciful. No"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16985"],[0,"The Proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh (#2)"],[1,"will act as the nerve      centre of a world civilization, the focus towards which the      unifying forces of life will converge and from which its      energizing influences will radiate. A world language will either      be invented or chosen from among the existing languages and will      be taught in the schools of all the federated nations as an      auxiliary to their mother tongue. A world script, a world      literature, a uniform and universal system of currency, of weights      and measures, will simplify and facilitate intercourse and      understanding among the nations and races of mankind. In such a      world society, science and religion, the two most potent forces in      human life, will be reconciled, will co-operate, and will      harmoniously develop. The press will, under such a system, while      giving full scope to the expression of the diversified views and      convictions of mankind, cease to be mischievously manipulated by      vested interests, whether private or public, and will be liberated      from the influence of contending governments and peoples. The      economic resources of the world will be organized, its sources of      raw materials will be tapped and fully utilized, its markets will      be co-ordinated and developed, and the distribution of its      products will be equitably regulated.        National rivalries, hatreds and intrigues will cease, and racial      animosity and prejudice will be replaced by racial amity,      understanding and co-operation. The causes of religious strife      will be permanently removed, economic barriers and restrictions      will be completely abolished, and the inordinate distinction      between classes will be obliterated. Destitution on the one hand,      and gross accumulation of ownership on the other, will disappear.      The enormous energy dissipated and wasted on war, whether economic      or political, will be consecrated to such ends as will extend the      range of human inventions and technical development, to the      increase of the productivity of mankind, to the extermination of      disease, to the extension of scientific research, to the raising      of the standard of physical health, to the sharpening and      refinement of the human brain, to the exploitation of the unused      and unsuspected resources of the planet, to the prolongation of      human life, and to the furtherance of any other agency that can      stimulate the intellectual, the moral, and spiritual life of the      entire human race.        A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and exercising      unchallengeable authority over its unimaginably vast resources,      blending and embodying the ideals of both the East and the West,      liberated from the curse of war and its miseries, and bent on the      exploitation of all the available sources of energy on the surface      of the planet, a system in which Force is made the servant of      Justice, whose life is sustained by its universal recognition of      one God and by its allegiance to one common Revelation--such is the      goal towards which humanity, impelled by the unifying forces of      life, is moving.      Baha'u'llah's message is one of hope, of love, of practical  reconstruction. Today we reap the appalling results of our forebears'  rejection of His divine call; but today there are new rulers, new people,  who perchance may hear and avoid or mitigate the severity of impending  catastrophe. It is with this hope and believing it to be its sacred duty,  that the Universal House of Justice, the international governing body of  the Baha'i Faith, proclaims again, through publication of these selected  passages, the essence of that mighty call of a century ago. In the same  hope and belief the Baha'is throughout the world will do their utmost  during this centenary period to bring to the attention of their fellow-men  the redeeming fact of this new outpouring of divine guidance and love. We  believe they will not labour in vain.    Haifa, 1967            SUMMONS TO THE KINGS AND RULERS OF THE WORLD COLLECTIVELY          \"O KINGS of the earth! He Who is the sovereign...\"      O KINGS of the earth! He Who is the sovereign Lord of all is come. The  Kingdom is God's, the omnipotent Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Worship  none but God, and, with radiant hearts, lift up your faces unto your Lord,  the Lord of all names. This is a Revelation to which whatever ye possess  can never be compared, could ye but know it. We see you rejoicing in that  which ye have amassed for others, and shutting out yourselves from the  worlds which naught except My Guarded Tablet can reckon. The treasures ye  have laid up have drawn you far away from your ultimate objective. This  ill beseemeth you, could ye but understand it. Wash your hearts from all  earthly defilements, and hasten to enter the Kingdom of your Lord, the  Creator of earth and heaven, Who caused the world to tremble, and all its  peoples to wail, except them that have renounced all things and clung to  that which the Hidden Tablet hath ordained....    O Kings of the earth! The Most Great Law hath been revealed in this Spot,  this Scene of transcendent splendour. Every hidden thing hath been brought  to light, by virtue of the Will of the Supreme Ordainer, He Who hath  ushered in the Last Hour, through Whom the Moon hath been cleft, and every  irrevocable decree expounded.    Ye are but vassals, O Kings of the earth! He Who is the King of kings hath  appeared, arrayed in His most wondrous glory, and is summoning you unto  Himself, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Take heed lest pride  deter you from recognizing the Source of Revelation; lest the things of  this world shut you out as by a veil from Him Who is the Creator of  heaven. Arise, and serve Him Who is the Desire of all nations, Who hath  created you through a word from Him, and ordained you to be, for all time,  the emblems of His sovereignty.    By the righteousness of God! It is not Our wish to lay hands on your  kingdoms. Our mission is to seize and possess the hearts of men. Upon them  the eyes of Baha are fastened. To this testifieth the Kingdom of Names,  could ye but comprehend it. Whoso followeth his Lord, will renounce the  world and all that is therein; how much greater, then, must be the  detachment of Him Who holdeth so august a station! Forsake your palaces,  and haste ye to gain admittance into His Kingdom. This, indeed, will  profit you both in this world and in the next. To this testifieth the Lord  of the realm on high, did ye but know it.    How great is the blessedness that awaiteth the king who will arise to aid  My Cause in My Kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but Me! Such  a king is numbered with the companions of the Crimson Ark, the Ark which  God hath prepared for the people of Baha. All must glorify his name, must  reverence his station, and aid him to unlock the cities with the keys of  My Name, the omnipotent Protector of all that inhabit the visible and  invisible kingdoms. Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous  ornament on the brow of creation, the fountainhead of blessings unto the  whole world. Offer up, O people of Baha, your substance, nay your very  lives, for his assistance.    We have asked nothing from you. For the sake of God We, verily, exhort  you, and will be patient as We have been patient in that which hath  befallen Us at your hands, O concourse of kings!          \"O KINGS of the earth! Give ear unto the Voice of God,...\"      O KINGS of the earth! Give ear unto the Voice of God, calling from this  sublime, this fruit-laden Tree, that hath sprung out of the Crimson Hill,  upon the holy Plain, intoning the words: 'There is none other God but He,  the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.'... Fear God, O concourse of  kings, and suffer not yourselves to be deprived of this most sublime  grace. Fling away, then, the things ye possess, and take fast hold on the  Handle of God, the Exalted, the Great. Set your hearts towards the Face of  God, and abandon that which your desires have bidden you to follow, and be  not of those who perish. Relate unto them, O Servant, the story of 'Ali  (the Bab), when He came unto them with truth, bearing His glorious and  weighty Book, and holding in His hands a testimony and proof from God, and  holy and blessed tokens from Him. Ye, however, O Kings, have failed to  heed the Remembrance of God in His days and to be guided by the lights  which arose and shone forth above the horizon of a resplendent Heaven. Ye  examined not His Cause when so to do would have been better for you than  all that the sun shineth upon, could ye but perceive it. Ye remained  careless until the divines of Persia--those cruel ones--pronounced judgment  against Him, and unjustly slew Him. His spirit ascended unto God, and the  eyes of the inmates of Paradise and the angels that are nigh unto Him wept  sore by reason of this cruelty. Beware that ye be not careless henceforth  as ye have been careless aforetime. Return, then, unto God, your Maker,  and be not of the heedless.... My face hath come forth from the veils, and  shed its radiance upon all that is in heaven and on earth; and yet, ye  turned not towards Him, notwithstanding that ye were created for Him, O  concourse of kings! Follow, therefore, that which I speak unto you, and  hearken unto it with your hearts, and be not of such as have turned aside.  For your glory consisteth not in your sovereignty, but rather in your  nearness unto God and your observance of His command as sent down in His  holy and preserved Tablets. Should any one of you rule over the whole  earth, and over all that lieth within it and upon it, its seas, its lands,  its mountains, and its plains, and yet be not remembered by God, all these  would profit him not, could ye but know it.... Arise, then, and make  steadfast your feet, and make ye amends"]]]
