(C) BAHA'I PUBLISHING TRUST, INDIA    Reprinted by  K.L. Sachdeva - for Skylark Printers,  479, Matia Mahal, Jama Masjid, Delhi-6            PREFACE      The sub-continent of India, favoured by special mention in the  Qayyumu'l-Asma, on the Day of the Declaration of the Bab, is a land of the  greatest spiritual potentialities. During the life time of Abdu'l-Baha a  steady stream of teachers from East and West arrived to establish the  Faith, and at the time of His passing, there was a sizeable community of  Baha'is in India. This was the community that grew into spiritual  maturity, expanded and developed under the unerring guidance of our  beloved Guardian who fostered its growth, ever beckoning it forward.    The Guardian summoned the believers to achieve great victories, local  movements and limited projects would not be commensurate with the  greatness of the Revelation of Baha'u'llah; he led them to self-sacrifice,  to big undertakings, and to bold ventures. Gradually, he brought to light  the vastness of the realm of service, pointing out the many races and  tribes that inhabited this land of ancient civilization and cradle of  important world religions. He gave instructions and plans to this  Community to take the healing Message of God to all these peoples and  tribes. Step by step, Shoghi Effendi guided the Community on how to plan  and organize a comprehensive teaching plan.    As far back as 1933, the beloved Guardian summoned the Baha'is of India to  teach among the masses, and to reach persons of capacity in every strata  of society. He guided us in every accomplishment, pointing out the  objectives, counselling and urging the completion of goals set for the  Community.    The reader will find for himself what great victories still remain to be  won and what great potentialities still remain hidden in India--\"a vast  country and an excellent field of service\". This book is for those,  anywhere in the world, who wish to arise individually and collectively to  establish the World Order of Baha'u'llah and the Kingdom of God on earth.    Dr. R. Muhajir    New Delhi,  March 9, 1970            LETTERS ADDRESSED TO THE N.S.A. OF INDIA          Letter to believers in India & Burmah      The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the  Merciful throughout India and Burmah,  Care of the members of the Spiritual Assembly.    Beloved co-workers in the Vineyard of God!    It has been my great pleasure and privilege to send you, since my return  to the Holy Land, first my general message of confidence and of love  addressed to all believers throughout the East, and later another letter  wherein I appeal in particular to those faithful lovers of His Cause in  that vast and distant dominion to labour whole-heartedly and to the very  end for the diffusion of His Light and the spread of His Cause.  Remembering, however, the few among my friends in that land who are as yet  unfamiliar with the Persian Tongue, I have thought of sending these few  lines to them in particular and through them to the rest of my brethren  and sisters in those regions who, despite the diversity of tongue, of race  and custom are all united at heart and animated by one common desire to  uplift humanity and carry out His Divine Purpose for this world.    What an alluring field of service India with all its possibilities unfolds  to our eyes at the present time and how vast are the opportunities of  sowing the seeds of unity and loving kindness in the hearts of its divers  peoples!    True, that land seems now unhappily to be plunged in the darkness of  prejudice, hate and mistrust, yet however dark the immediate prospect may  appear, our confidence remains unshaken that ere long these mists shall  clear away, the dawn of a New Day shall break upon that land and the Rays  of this Divine Revelation shall make of India a spiritually-quickened,  peaceful and united country.    The universal Teachings of Baha'u'llah if declared and propounded with  wisdom and judgement, determination, selflessness and sincerity, and above  all if exemplified in our lives and dealings with our fellow-men, cannot  fail to inspire and stimulate the mind of the enlightened seeker and win  the admiration and allegiance of all mankind. Ours then is the duty and  privilege to bring to the attention of this distressed and war-weary world  this Message of Eternal Salvation and help to establish the Era of Peace  and Brotherhood as purposed and foretold by Baha'u'llah.    The welcome news of the progress of the Third All-India Baha'i Convention  as well as the favourable comment made upon it by the Press of that  country have been fully shared with the pilgrims and resident friends in  the Holy Land and we have all admired and rejoiced at the efforts you are  exerting for the consolidation of the Movement in that ancient land.    May your endeavours in every sphere of your spiritual activities be  crowned with brilliant success, that His glorious Promise regarding the  future of that land may be speedily fulfilled!    It is my earnest hope that \"The Baha'i News\", the representative organ of  the Baha'i Community in India, may expand and develop, may widen the  sphere of its correspondence, add to the number and quality of its  articles in Persian as well as in English, report regularly in its columns  the news of the spiritual activities of all Baha'i centres in India and  elsewhere, and in general provide for the full, correct and dignified  presentation of the Cause to the general public.    Assuring every one of you of my constant prayers on your behalf and  wishing you success in your noble task,    I am your brother and co-worker,  SHOGHI    January 9, 1923          Excellent Field of Service      As you mentioned India is a vast country and an excellent field of  service. If the younger Baha'i generation, in whom Shoghi Effendi has  great hopes, take the pain of studying the Cause deeply and thoroughly,  read its history, find its underlying principles and become both well  informed and energetic, they surely can achieve a great deal. It is upon  their shoulders that the Master has laid the tremendous work of teaching.  They are the ones to raise the call of the Kingdom and arouse the people  from slumber. If they fail the Cause is doomed to stagnation. May we all  hope and earnestly pray that through God's infinite grace, through the  Master's spiritual guidance and through Shoghi Effendi's tender care we  may do justice to this tremendous work and not fail to do the Master's  bidding.    As Shoghi Effendi has not yet taken up the tremendous work and  responsibility of attending to the correspondence of the individual  friends, he asked me to write you this note, acknowledge the receipt of  your letter, and ask you to do the following things: (1) Change the name  of your Executive Committee to \"The National Spiritual Assembly\", because  the corresponding Assembly in England and America bear the same name, and  uniformity in such matters is most advisable. (2) He likes to receive  regular and detailed reports of the position of the Cause as well as the  activities of the friends in India drafted as well as sent by the  Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly. So as to be informed of the  conditions there and administer to your needs. (3) He wishes to have the  postal as well as telegraphic address of the secretary so as to send his  communications to him.    Shoghi Effendi earnestly hopes and prays that this National Spiritual  Assembly will be able to achieve a great deal and herald a new era of  spiritual awakening in that land.    April 26, 1923          Position of Baha'i Women      [From the Guardian:]    Regarding"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19274"],[0,"Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand (#2)"],[1,"n:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    I rejoice to learn of the momentous step the Baha'is of Australia and  New-Zealand have taken. They will surely be reinforced by the hosts of the  Kingdom, and deserve the praise and admiration of their fellow-believers  throughout the world. Constancy, co-operation, unity and steadfast  adherence to the spiritual and administrative principles of the Faith are  essential during these days when the foundations of the Universal House of  Justice are being laid through your devoted efforts in your own country. I  will continue to pray for you from the depths of my heart.    Your true brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF JULY 26TH, 1934      July 26th, 1934.    Dear Miss Brooks,    I am directed by the Guardian to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of  June 6th, written on behalf on the N.S.A. of the Baha'is of Australia and  New-Zealand, and to convey to you, and to your collaborators on that  Assembly his grateful appreciation of the stupendous efforts you have  unanimously exerted for making your first Convention such a sucessful and  promising meeting. Your collective and continued sacrifices, as well as  the assistance and guidance of Baha'u'llah have surely been responsible  for this historic triumph which you have been able to achieve in the  administrative field of the Cause--a triumph which will inevitably bring  about a renewed and deeper spiritual consciousness to all the believers in  these far-off lands.    Shoghi Effendi is praying from the very depths of his heart for your  guidance and assistance, and hopes that as a result your National Assembly  will be soon enabled to take such steps as would enable it to extend and  to further consolidate its national as well as international activities.    With warm greetings to you and to all the friends in Adelaide,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    My heart is filled with joy and gratitude as a result of the perusal of  your letter. I long to be in close and constant touch with your  newly-formed national assembly--the first of your administrative activities  and the herald of one of the most fruitful and stirring periods of the  history of the Faith in that promising continent. I will be so glad to  receive copies of the minutes of your gatherings, and urge you to keep in  close touch with your sister assemblies throughout the Baha'i world. I  will assuredly pray for you and your dear and devoted collaborators from  the depths of my heart.    Your true brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF OCTOBER 17TH, 1934      October 17th, 1934    Dear Baha'i Friend,    I am directed by the Guardian to acknowledge the receipt of your letter  dated August 31st with its most interesting enclosures, all of which he  has carefully read and considered. It is with deep gratification that he  follows the progress and extension of the work of your N.S.A., and he  hopes and prays that through the confirmations of the Almighty it will  serve to give an increasing impetus to the progress of the Faith in your  land.    The Guardian has read with particular interest the minutes of the meetings  of your N.S.A. He hopes to receive them regularly, and thus to be in close  and constant touch with your national activities.    In regard to your question as to whether it is permissible to substitute  the plural pronoun for the singular in prayers worded in the singular, the  Guardian would strongly urge your N.S.A. to inform the friends to strictly  adhere to the text of the Holy Writings, and not to deviate even a  hair-breadth from what has been revealed by the Holy Pen. Besides, it  should be noted that congregational prayer has been discouraged by  Baha'u'llah, and that it is allowed only in the case of the prayer for the  dead.    Concerning the Healing Prayer, the Guardian wishes me to inform you that  there is no special ruling for its recital. The believer is free to recite  it as many times and in the way he wishes. There are also no obligatory  prayers for the Fast. But there are some specific ones revealed by  Baha'u'llah for that purpose.    As to the instructions given in the little black covered Prayer Book, they  are by no means complete and are only tentative. When the Book of Aqdas is  published, the believers will have then full and authoritative  prescriptions about the form of prayer, and other instructions and rulings  of a spiritual character.    With loving greetings to you and to the members of the N.S.A.,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dearly beloved co-worker:    My constant prayers for the extension of the activities in which you and  your dear fellow-labourers are so stenuously engaged will be offered on  your behalf that the splendid era which you have inaugurated may redound  to the glory and honour of the Most Great Name. I am truly proud of the  manner in which my loved friends in Australia and New-Zealand have arisen  to discharge their sacred and pressing responsibilities. Great triumphs, I  feel convinced, are in store for them if they persevere in their mighty  task. May the Almighty bless their high endeavours and enable them to  achieve His purpose.    Your true brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF JANUARY 16TH, 1935      January 16th, 1935.    Dear Baha'i Sister,    Your welcome letter of the 13th of December, together with the  accompanying message of December 11th addressed to the Guardian by \"The  General Purposes and Business Committee\" of the N.S.A. have all been duly  received and deeply appreciated by him.    He has also received and read with great care and interest the enclosed  copy of the minutes of the above-mentioned committee, and was pleased to  realize that, despite the various impediments standing in the way of your  Assembly, that body is functioning smoothly and with one accord. He hopes  that the various steps taken by your Committee in connection with the  publication of the \"Herald of the South\" will all materialize and meet  with success.    May I also in closing express the Guardian's appreciation of your efforts  in connection with the management and direction of this monthly review,  and also with regard to your activities in the field of teaching.    With his loving greetings to you and to your co-workers in the \"Herald of  the South\" Committee, and with the assurance of his prayers for you all.    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-workers:    The repeated evidences of the strenuous efforts exerted by the believers  in Australia and New-Zealand for the spread of the Cause and the rise and  consolidation of its institutions have brought me intense joy and excited  my deepest admiration. I urge them to persevere, to remain united, not to  relax in their determination, and to strive with all their might to extend  the scope of their meritorious activities. I will continue to pray for  them from the bottom of my heart.    Your true brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF APRIL 24TH, 1935      April 24th, 1935    Dear Baha'i Sister,    The Guardian has read with great care and interest your letter of the 24th  of March last, and has noted with deep satisfaction the steady progress  which your N.S.A. is making since its formation last year. He is  particularly pleased and encouraged to realise how wisely and effectively  your Assembly is adjusting itself to the general conditions and specific  requirements of the Cause in Australia and New-Zealand, to such an extent  that obstacles which a year ago seemed to be insurmountable have now,  through the sustained and earnest efforts of the friends, been partially  if not completely removed. Your Assembly has, indeed, truly vindicated its  ability and power to function as a well-organized and united body, and  this in the face of manifold difficulties which the all-conquering spirit  of the Faith could alone overcome. Nothing short of this Divine spirit, as  expressed through the self-sacrificing and confident labours of the  Australian and New-Zealand friends, could have so effectively subdued  those forces which every now and then threatened to undermine the  foundations of your Assembly, and thus overthrow the entire system of the  Administration in your land.    Now that the N.S.A. has successfully emerged out of these difficulties and  trials, the Guardian has every reason to believe that the progress thus  far achieved will continue undiminished and undeterred by any obstacle,  however formidable it may seem to appear.    In his moments of meditation and prayer at the Holy Shrines he will  specially supplicate for the guidance and assistance of the N.S.A. and  will supplicate Baha'u'llah to inspire its members in all their  deliberations.    With his warmest and most loving appreciation and greetings to them and to  all the friends in Adelaide.    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    I fully approve of the decisions arrived at by your assembly regarding the  various issues referred to in your letter, and feel gratified to learn of  the zeal, the constancy, the loyalty and the determination with which the  national representatives of the believers in Australia and New-Zealand are  prosecuting the noble work entrusted to them by the Almighty. I would urge  you to take the necessary steps for the incorporation of your national  assembly as soon as you adopt your Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, and I  pray that the almighty hand of Baha'u'llah may guide and sustain you in  your high and historic endeavours.    Your true and grateful brother,  Shoghi.            LETTER OF JUNE 19TH, 1935      June 19th, 1935    Dear Baha'i Sister,    The Guardian has received your letter dated May 8th, and has carefully  read and considered its contents. He wishes me to thank you for it, and  specially to convey to you, as well as to the other members of your  "]]]
