To make it drop more  quickly, for they change it as adders do their skins, they roll among  the brush-wood which they find in the ravines.    \"Their tail is very short, and terminates in a great tuft. When they run  they carry it in the air like scorpions. When quite young they are  tawny, and resemble our calves; but as age increases they change color  and form.    \"Another thing which struck us was that all the old buffaloes that we  killed had the left ear cloven, while it was entire in the young; we  could never discover the reason of this.    \"Their wool is so fine that handsome clothes would certainly be made of  it, but it can not be dyed for it is tawny red. We were much surprised  at sometimes meeting innumerable herds of bulls without a single cow,  and other herds of cows without bulls.\"    Neither De Soto, Ponce de Leon, Vasquez de Ayllon, nor Pamphilo de  Narvaez ever saw a buffalo, for the reason that all their explorations  were made south of what was then the habitat of that animal. At the time  De Soto made his great exploration from Florida northwestward to the  Mississippi and into Arkansas (1539-'41) he did indeed pass through  country in northern Mississippi and Louisiana that was afterward  inhabited by the buffalo, but at that time not one was to be found  there. Some of his soldiers, however, who were sent into the northern  part of Arkansas, reported having seen buffalo skins in the possession  of the Indians, and were told that live buffaloes were to be found 5 or  6 leagues north of their farthest point.    The earliest discovery of the bison in Eastern North America, or indeed  anywhere north of Coronado's route, was made somewhere near Washington,  District of Columbia, in 1612, by an English navigator named Samuel  Argoll,[3] and narrated as follows:    \"As soon as I had unladen this corne, I set my men to the felling of  Timber, for the building of a Frigat, which I had left half finished at  Point Comfort, the 19. of March: and returned myself with the ship into  Pembrook [Potomac] River, and so discovered to the head of it, which is  about 65 leagues into the Land, and navigable for any ship. And then  marching into the Countrie, I found great store of Cattle as big as  Kine, of which the Indians that were my guides killed a couple, which we  found to be very good and wholesome meate, and are very easie to be  killed, in regard they are heavy, slow, and not so wild as other beasts  of the wildernesse.\"    [Note 3: Purchas: His Pilgrimes. (1625.) Vol. IV, p. 1765. \"A letter of  Sir Samuel Argoll touching his Voyage to Virginia, and actions there.  Written to Master Nicholas Hawes, June, 1613.\"]    It is to be regretted that the narrative of the explorer affords no clew  to the precise locality of this interesting discovery, but since it is  doubtful that the mariner journeyed very far on foot from the head of  navigation of the Potomac, it seems highly probable that the first  American bison seen by Europeans, other than the Spaniards, was found  within 15 miles, or even less, of the capital of the United States, and  possibly within the District of Columbia itself.    The first meeting of the white man with the buffalo on the northern  boundary of that animal's habitat occurred in 1679, when Father  Hennepin ascended the St. Lawrence to the great lakes, and finally  penetrated the great wilderness as far as western Illinois.    The next meeting with the buffalo on the Atlantic slope was in October,  1729, by a party of surveyors under Col. William Byrd, who were engaged  in surveying the boundary between North Carolina and Virginia.    As the party journeyed up from the coast, marking the line which now  constitutes the interstate boundary, three buffaloes were seen on  Sugar-Tree Creek, but none of them were killed.    On the return journey, in November, a bull buffalo was killed on  Sugar-Tree Creek, which is in Halifax County, Virginia, within 5 miles  of Big Buffalo Creek; longitude 78Â° 40' W., and 155 miles from the  coast.[4] \"It was found all alone, tho' Buffaloes Seldom are.\" The meat  is spoken of as \"a Rarity,\" not met at all on the expedition up. The  animal was found in thick woods, which were thus feelingly described:  \"The woods were thick great Part of this Day's Journey, so that we were  forced to scuffle hard to advance 7 miles, being equal in fatigue to  double that distance of Clear and Open Ground.\" One of the creeks which  the party crossed was christened Buffalo Creek, and \"so named from the  frequent tokens we discovered of that American Behemoth.\"    [Note 4: Westover Manuscript. Col. William Byrd. Vol. I, p. 178.]    In October, 1733, on another surveying expedition, Colonel Byrd's party  had the good fortune to kill another buffalo near Sugar-Tree Creek,  which incident is thus described:[5]    [Note 5: Vol. II, pp. 24, 25.]    \"We pursued our journey thro' uneven and perplext woods, and in the  thickest of them had the Fortune to knock down a Young Buffalo 2 years  old. Providence threw this vast animal in our way very Seasonably, just  as our provisions began to fail us. And it was the more welcome, too,  because it was change of dyet, which of all Varietys, next to that of  Bed-fellows, is the most agreeable. We had lived upon Venison and Bear  till our stomachs loath'd them almost as much as the Hebrews of old did  their Quails. Our Butchers were so unhandy at their Business that we  grew very lank before we cou'd get our Dinner. But when it came, we  found it equal in goodness to the best Beef. They made it the longer  because they kept Sucking the Water out of the Guts in imitation of the  Catauba Indians, upon the belief that it is a great Cordial, and will  even make them drunk, or at least very Gay.\"    A little later a solitary bull buffalo was found, _but spared_,[6] the  earliest instance of the kind on record, and which had few successors to  keep it company.    [Note 6: _Ib._, p. 28.]          II. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.      The range of the American bison extended over about one-third of the  entire continent of North America. Starting almost at tide-water on the  Atlantic coast, it extended westward through a vast tract of dense  forest, across the Alleghany Mountain system to the prairies along the  Mississippi, and southward to the Delta of that great stream. Although  the great plains country of the West was the natural home of the  species, where it flourished most abundantly, it also wandered south  across Texas to the burning plains of northeastern Mexico, westward  across the Rocky Mountains into New Mexico, Utah, and Idaho, and  northward across a vast treeless waste to the bleak and inhospitable  shores of the Great Slave Lake itself. It is more than probable that had  the bison remained unmolested by man and uninfluenced by him, he would  eventually have crossed the Sierra Nevadas and the Coast Range and taken  up his abode in the fertile valleys of the Pacific slope.    Had the bison remained for a few more centuries in undisturbed  possession of his range, and with liberty to roam at will over the North  American continent, it is almost certain that several distinctly  recognizable varieties would have been produced. The buffalo of the hot  regions in the extreme south would have become a short-haired animal  like the gaur of India and the African buffalo. The individuals  inhabiting the extreme north, in the vicinity of Great Slave Lake, for  example, would have developed still longer hair, and taken on more of  the dense hairyness of the musk ox. In the \"wood\" or \"mountain buffalo\"  we already have a distinct foreshadowing of the changes which would have  taken place in the individuals which made their permanent residence upon  rugged mountains.    It would be an easy matter to fill a volume with facts relating to the  geographical distribution of _Bison americanus_ and the dates of its  occurrence and disappearance in the multitude of different localities  embraced within the immense area it once inhabited. The capricious  shiftings of certain sections of the great herds, whereby large areas  which for many years had been utterly unvisited by buffaloes suddenly  became overrun by them, could be followed up indefinitely, but to little  purpose. In order to avoid wearying the reader with a mass of dates and  references, the map accompanying this paper has been prepared to show at  a glance the approximate dates at which the bison finally disappeared  from the various sections of its habitat. In some cases the date given  is coincident with the death of the last buffalo known to have been  killed in a given State or Territory; in others, where records are  meager, the date given is the nearest approximation, based on existing  records. In the preparation of this map I have drawn liberally from Mr.  J. A. Allen's admirable monograph of \"The American Bison,\" in which the  author has brought together, with great labor and invariable accuracy, a  vast amount of historical data bearing upon this subject. In this  connection I take great pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to  Professor Allen's work.    While it is inexpedient to include here all the facts that might be  recorded with reference to the discovery, existence, and ultimate  extinction of the bison in the various portions of its former habitat,  it is yet worth while to sketch briefly the extreme limits of its range.  In doing this, our starting point will be the Atlantic slope east of the  Alleghanies, and the reader will do well to refer to the large map.    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.--There is no indisputable evidence that the bison  ever inhabited this precise locality, but it is probable that it did. In  1612 Captain Argoll sailed up the \"Pembrook River\" to the head of  navigation (Mr. Allen believes this was the James River, and not the  Potomac) and marched"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17753"],[0,"On the Antiquity of the Chemical Art (#2)"],[1,"of philosophy. He invited learned men to his  kingdom from all nations, and paid them munificently; he employed them  in translating the most famous books of the Greeks and others, and  spread abroad throughout his dominions numerous copies of those works.    His second son, Al-Mamoon, while governor of the province of Kohrassan,  we are told, formed a college of learned men from every country, and  appointed as the president John Mesue, of Damascus. It is said that his  father, complaining that so great an honour had been conferred on a  Christian, received the reply--\"That Mesue had been chosen, not as a  teacher of religion, but as an able preceptor in useful arts and  sciences; and my father well knows that the most learned men and the  most skilful artists in his dominions are Jews and Christians.\"    That this was the case can scarcely be doubted when we consider that the  Jews had always been familiar with many arts and sciences, and that, as  is well known, at the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, when the Jews  were dispersed in every direction, they spread over, not alone the  countries under the Roman rule, but to Greece, Egypt, and the  Mediterranean coast, as well as great part of Asia Minor, carrying with  them, not only their peculiar religious traditions, but also their arts,  which, we know, especially as regards the working of metals, were of no  mean order, and their sciences, of which the so-called magic and  astrology had been assiduously cultivated.    In Asia the dispersed Jews established patriarchates at Tiberias in the  west, and at Mahalia, and afterwards at Baghdad, for the Jews who were  beyond the Euphrates.    Seminaries were founded at these centres for the rabbis, and constant  intercourse was kept up between them. It was in these schools that the  Talmud was compiled from the traditionary exposition of the Old  Testament, between A.D. 200 and A.D. 500, when it was completed, and  received as a rule of faith by most of the scattered Jews.    That the cultivation of science was not neglected we may be sure from  the keen interest taken in all ages by the Jews in magical and  astrological inquiries. We read in Apuleius, in his defence on the  accusation of magic brought against him, that of the \"four tutors  appointed to educate the princes of Persia, one had to instruct him  specially in the magic of Zoroaster and Oromazes, which is the worship  of the gods.\" Apuleius wrote about 200 A.D., and his works teem with  references to magic and astrology.    The fact that Jews and Christians were looked on as learned men will not  surprise us, when we find that the Jews had established schools so long  anterior to the foundation of the college of Baghdad. The rapid progress  made by the Arabians, and the wise policy of the Abasside Caliphs, under  whose judicious rule learning was so liberally encouraged, aided by the  position of Baghdad, which formed, as it were, a centre to which the  wisdom of both eastern and western minds gravitated, attracted to their  schools all those of every nation who boasted themselves philosophers.    The first translations from the Greek authors are supposed to have been  made about A.D. 745, and are known to have been on the subjects of  philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. These translations are  understood to have been made by Christian or Jewish physicians.    As we have seen, the Jews had already established themselves at Baghdad,  and had founded schools of their own previous to the formation of the  college under Caliph Al-Mansour; but further than this we find the  Christians spread widely over the countries of Asia Minor, and we are  told, on the authority of Cosmo-Indicopleustes, that so early as A.D.  535 there was in almost every large town in _India_ a Christian Church  under the Bishop of Seleucia.    With these facts before us--1st, that Christian physicians were the  leaders of the Arabian school in the eighth century; 2nd, that large  numbers of Christian churches were actually in existence in India at  least two hundred years previously to the establishment of the college  at Baghdad; and 3rd, that Baghdad was almost, as it wore, the central  point of the great caravan route which from time immemorial had been the  course of communication between the East and West, can we doubt that an  extensive intercourse must have taken place, and should we not expect to  find some traces, if not the effects, of Indian science on the teaching  of the Arabian school.[1]        [Footnote 1: As to communication, the case of Saggid Mahmud (given      in Bellew's _Indus to the Tigris_), who, merely to pray for the      recovery of his sick son, travelled with him from Ghazni by way of      Kandahur and Shikarpur to Bombay, thence by way of sea to Baghdad,      from there to Karbola, and back to Baghdad; and then by Kirmanshah      and Kum to Teheran, on his way home to Ghazni, gives an indication      of the long journeys taken under the most frightful difficulties.      This long journey had occupied six months only, and we read that      in former times twelve years were sometimes taken in trading      journeys.]    In Vol. VIII. of the Journal of Education we find a notice that  \"Professor Dietz, of the University of Koenigsberg, who had spent five  years of his life in visiting the principal libraries of Germany, Italy,  Switzerland, Spain, France, and England, in search of manuscripts of  Greek, Roman, and Oriental writers on medicine, is now engaged in  publishing his 'Analecta Medica.'    \"The work contains several interesting papers on the subject of physical  science among the Indians and Arabians, and communicates several  introductory notices and illustrations from native Eastern writers.  Dietz proves that the late Greek physicians were acquainted with the  medical works of the Hindus, and availed themselves of their  medicaments; but he more particularly shows that the Arabians were  familiar with them, and extolled the healing art, as practised by the  Indians, quite as much as that in use among the Greeks.    \"It appears from Ibn Osaibe's testimony (from whose biographical work  Dietz has given a long abstract on the lives of Indian physicians), that  a variety of treatises on medical science were translated from the  Sanscrit into Persian and Arabic, particularly the more important  compilations of Charaka and Susruta, which are still held in estimation  in India; and that Manka and Saleh--the former of whom translated a  special treatise on poisons into Persian--even held appointments as  body-physicians at the Court of Harun-al-Raschid.\"    As the age of the medical works of Charaka and Susruta is incontestably  much more ancient than that of any other work on the subject (except the  Ayur Veda)--as we shall see when we come to consider the science of the  Hindoos--this in itself would be sufficient to show that the Arabians  were certainly not the originators of either medical or chemical  science.    We should not forget that it is only to their own works and their  translations, chiefly by the Greeks, we owe our knowledge of the state  of Arabian science, and that it is only in rare cases that we have given  a list of works consulted, so that we can gather the sources from which  their knowledge was derived. It would scarcely be imagined, from reading  the works of Roger Bacon, or of Newton, that they had derived some, at  least, of their knowledge from Arabian sources; and yet such is known to  have been the case with them both.    Let us now glance backwards from the Arabians to the Greeks.    It is supposed that the first translations from the Greek authors were  made for the Caliphs about 745 A.D., and were first translated into  Syriac, and then into Arabic. The works of Aristotle, Euclid, Ptolemy,  Hippocrates, Galen, and Dioscorides are known to have been translated  under the reign of Al-Mansour.    Granting for the moment that the first knowledge of the sciences was  obtained by the Arabians from the Greeks, we are at once face to face  with the question. From whence did the Greeks obtain their knowledge? To  any careful reader it will be clear that Grecian science and philosophy,  like Grecian theology, was not of native birth. It is comparatively well  known that the Greeks were indebted to the Egyptians for much of their  theology as well as science. The great truths which really underlay the  mysterious religious rites of Egypt seem to have been altogether lost  when the Greeks wove their complicated system of theology; and we read  that the Egyptian priests looked on the Greeks as children who failed to  understand the great mysteries involved in their religious rites,  disguised as they were in symbolic form. But, besides their indebtedness  to Egypt, we will find that they also owed much to Persia, and through  it again to Indian sources of knowledge.    There was constant communication between the Grecian and Persian  nations. We learn that it was not uncommon for Grecian generals to take  service under the Persian Satraps, tempted by the liberal recompence  with which their services were rewarded. About the year 356 B.C. this  system of Greeks accepting service under Persian Satraps nearly caused  the outbreak of war between Greece and Persia--Chares, a Grecian  commander, having assisted with his fleet and men, Artabanus, the Satrap  of Propontis, who was then in revolt against the Persian king. But  before this, during the great plague which desolated Athens in 430 B.C.,  and which also extended to Persia, Hippocrates was invited to go to the  Persian Court; and it is on record that Ctesias was for seventeen years  physician at the Persian Court about 400 B.C., during which period he  wrote his history of Persia, and an account of India, which Professor  Wilson, in a paper read to the Ashmolean Society of Oxford, has shown to  contain notices of the natural productions of the country, \"whi"]]]
