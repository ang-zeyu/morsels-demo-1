We have  taken the inner essence thereof and clothed it in the garment of brevity,  as a token of grace unto the righteous, that they may stand faithful unto  the Covenant of God, may fulfill in their lives His trust, and in the  realm of spirit obtain the gem of Divine virtue._        \"1: O SON OF SPIRIT!

My first counsel is this: Possess a pure, kindly and  radiant heart, that thine may be a sovereignty ancient, imperishable and  everlasting.        \"2: O SON OF SPIRIT! The best beloved of all things in My sight is  Justice;...\"      O SON OF SPIRIT! The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice;  turn not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it not that I may  confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not  through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not  through the knowledge of thy neighbor. Ponder this in thy heart; how it  behooveth thee to be. Verily justice is My gift to thee and the sign of My  loving-kindness. Set it then before thine eyes.        \"3: O SON OF MAN! Veiled in My immemorial being and in the ancient...\"      O SON OF MAN! Veiled in My immemorial being and in the ancient eternity of  My essence, I knew My love for thee; therefore I created thee, have  engraved on thee Mine image and revealed to thee My beauty.        \"4: O SON OF MAN! I loved thy creation, hence I created thee.  Wherefore,...\"      O SON OF MAN! I loved thy creation, hence I created thee. Wherefore, do  thou love Me, that I may name thy name and fill thy soul with the spirit  of life.        \"5: O SON OF BEING! Love Me, that I may love thee. If thou lovest Me...\"      O SON OF BEING! Love Me, that I may love thee. If thou lovest Me not, My  love can in no wise reach thee. Know this, O servant.        \"6: O SON OF BEING! Thy Paradise is My love; thy heavenly home,  reunion...\"      O SON OF BEING! Thy Paradise is My love; thy heavenly home, reunion with  Me. Enter therein and tarry not. This is that which hath been destined for  thee in Our kingdom above and Our exalted dominion.        \"7: O SON OF MAN! If thou lovest Me, turn away from thyself; and if...\"      O SON OF MAN! If thou lovest Me, turn away from thyself; and if thou  seekest My pleasure, regard not thine own; that thou mayest die in Me and  I may eternally live in thee.        \"8: O SON OF SPIRIT! There is no peace for thee save by renouncing...\"      O SON OF SPIRIT! There is no peace for thee save by renouncing thyself and  turning unto Me; for it behooveth thee to glory in My name, not in thine  own; to put thy trust in Me and not in thyself, since I desire to be loved  alone and above all that is.        \"9: O SON OF BEING! My love is My stronghold; he that entereth therein...\"      O SON OF BEING! My love is My stronghold; he that entereth therein is safe  and secure, and he that turneth away shall surely stray and perish.        \"10: O SON OF UTTERANCE! Thou art My stronghold; enter therein that...\"      O SON OF UTTERANCE! Thou art My stronghold; enter therein that thou mayest  abide in safety. My love is in thee, know it, that thou mayest find Me  near unto thee.        \"11: O SON OF BEING! Thou art My lamp and My light is in thee....\"      O SON OF BEING! Thou art My lamp and My light is in thee. Get thou from it  thy radiance and seek none other than Me. For I have created thee rich and  have bountifully shed My favor upon thee.        \"12: O SON OF BEING! With the hands of power I made thee and with...\"      O SON OF BEING! With the hands of power I made thee and with the fingers  of strength I created thee; and within thee have I placed the essence of  My light. Be thou content with it and seek naught else, for My work is  perfect and My command is binding. Question it not, nor have a doubt  thereof.        \"13: O SON OF SPIRIT! I created thee rich, why dost thou bring thyself...\"      O SON OF SPIRIT! I created thee rich, why dost thou bring thyself down to  poverty? Noble I made thee, wherewith dost thou abase thyself? Out of the  essence of knowledge I gave thee being, why seekest thou enlightenment  from anyone beside Me? Out of the clay of love I molded thee, how dost  thou busy thyself with another? Turn thy sight unto thyself, that thou  mayest find Me standing within thee, mighty, powerful and self-subsisting.        \"14: O SON OF MAN! Thou art My dominion and My dominion perisheth...\"      O SON OF MAN! Thou art My dominion and My dominion perisheth not;  wherefore fearest thou thy perishing? Thou art My light and My light shall  never be extinguished; why dost thou dread extinction? Thou art My glory  and My glory fadeth not; thou art My robe and My robe shall never be  outworn. Abide then in thy love for Me, that thou mayest find Me in the  realm of glory.        \"15: O SON OF UTTERANCE! Turn thy face unto Mine and renounce all save...\"      O SON OF UTTERANCE! Turn thy face unto Mine and renounce all save Me; for  My sovereignty endureth and My dominion perisheth not. If thou seekest  another than Me, yea, if thou searchest the universe for evermore, thy  quest will be in vain.        \"16: O SON OF LIGHT! Forget all save Me and commune with My spirit....\"      O SON OF LIGHT! Forget all save Me and commune with My spirit. This is of  the essence of My command, therefore turn unto it.        \"17: O SON OF MAN! Be thou content with Me and seek no other...\"      O SON OF MAN! Be thou content with Me and seek no other helper. For none  but Me can ever suffice thee.        \"18: O SON OF SPIRIT! Ask not of Me that which We desire not for thee,...\"      O SON OF SPIRIT!

Saadi is said to have lived upwards of a hundred years,  thirty of which were passed in the acquisition of knowledge, thirty more  in travelling through different countries, and the rest of his life he  spent in retirement and acts of devotion. He died, in his native city,  about the year 1291.        [1] One reason, doubtless, for Persian and Turkish poets          adopting a _takhallus_ is the custom of the poet          introducing his name into every ghazal he composes,          generally towards the end; and as his proper name would          seldom or never accommodate itself to purposes of verse          he selects a more suitable one.    At one period of his life Saadi took part in the wars of the Saracens  against the Crusaders in Palestine, and also in the wars for the faith  in India. In the course of his wanderings he had the misfortune to be  taken prisoner by the Franks, in Syria, and was ransomed by a friend,  but only to fall into worse thraldom by marrying a shrewish wife. He has  thus related the circumstances:    \"Weary of the society of my friends at Damascus, I fled to the barren  wastes of Jerusalem, and associated with brutes, until I was made  captive by the Franks, and forced to dig clay along with Jews in the  fortress of Tripoli. One of the nobles of Aleppo, mine ancient friend,  happened to pass that way and recollected me. He said: 'What a state is  this to be in! How farest thou?' I answered: 'Seeing that I could place  confidence in God alone, I retired to the mountains and wilds, to avoid  the society of man; but judge what must be my situation, to be confined  in a stall, in company with wretches who deserve not the name of men.  \"To be confined by the feet with friends is better than to walk in a  garden with strangers.\"' He took compassion on my forlorn condition,  ransomed me from the Franks for ten dinars,[2] and took me with him to  Aleppo.        [2] A dinar is a gold coin, worth about ten shillings of our          money.    \"My friend had a daughter, to whom he married me, and he presented me  with a hundred dinars as her dower. After some time my wife unveiled her  disposition, which was ill-tempered, quarrelsome, obstinate, and  abusive; so that the happiness of my life vanished. It has been well  said: 'A bad woman in the house of a virtuous man is hell even in this  world.' Take care how you connect yourself with a bad woman. Save us, O  Lord, from the fiery trial! Once she reproached me, saying: 'Art thou  not the creature whom my father ransomed from captivity amongst the  Franks for ten dinars?' 'Yes,' I answered; 'he redeemed me for ten  dinars, and enslaved me to thee for a hundred.'    \"I heard that a man once rescued a sheep from the mouth of a wolf, but  at night drew his knife across its throat. The expiring sheep thus  complained: 'You delivered me from the jaws of a wolf, but in the end I  perceive you have yourself become a wolf to me.'\"    Sir Gore Ouseley, in his _Biographical Notices of Persian Poets_, states  that Saadi in the latter part of his life retired to a cell near Shiraz,  where he remained buried in contemplation of the Deity, except when  visited, as was often the case, by princes, nobles, and learned men. It  was the custom of his illustrious visitors to take with them all kinds  of meats, of which, when Saadi and his company had partaken, the shaykh  always put what remained in a basket suspended from his window, that the  poor wood-cutters of Shiraz, who daily passed by his cell, might  occasionally satisfy their hunger.           *       *       *       *       *    The writings of Saadi, in prose as well as verse, are numerous; his best  known works being the _Gulistan_, or Rose-Garden, and the _Bustan_, or  Garden of Odours. Among his other compositions are: an essay on Reason  and Love; Advice to Kings; Arabian and Persian idylls, and a book of  elegies, besides a large collection of odes and sonnets. Saadi was an  accomplished linguist, and composed several poems in the languages of  many of the countries through which he travelled. \"I have wandered to  various regions of the world,\" he tells us, \"and everywhere have I mixed  freely with the inhabitants. I have gathered something in each corner; I  have gleaned an ear from every harvest.\" A deep insight into the secret  springs of human actions; an extensive knowledge of mankind; fervent  piety, without a taint of bigotry; a poet's keen appreciation of the  beauties of nature; together with a ready wit and a lively sense of  humour, are among the characteristics of Saadi's masterly compositions.  No writer, ancient or modern, European or Asiatic, has excelled, and few  have equalled, Saadi in that rare faculty for condensing profound moral  truths into short, pithy sentences. For example:    \"The remedy against want is to moderate your desires.\"    \"There is a difference between him who claspeth his mistress in his  arms, and him whose eyes are fixed on the door expecting her.\"    \"Whoever recounts to you the faults of your neighbour will doubtless  expose your defects to others.\"    His humorous comparisons flash upon the reader's mind with curious  effect, occurring, as they often do, in the midst of a grave discourse.  Thus he says of a poor minstrel: \"You would say that the sound of his  bow would burst the arteries, and that his voice was more discordant  than the lamentations of a man for the death of his father;\" and of  another bad singer: \"No one with a mattock can so effectually scrape  clay from the face of a hard stone as his discordant voice harrows up  the soul.\"    Talking of music reminds me of a remark of the learned Gentius, in one  of his notes on the _Gulistan_ of Saadi, that music was formerly in such  consideration in Persia that it was a maxim of their sages that when a  king was about to die, if he left for his successor a very young son,  his aptitude for reigning should be proved by some agreeable songs; and  if the child was pleasurably affected, then it was a sign of his  capacity and genius, but if the contrary, he should be declared  unfit.--It would appear that the old Persian musicians, like Timotheus,  knew the secret art of swaying the passions. The celebrated philosopher  Al-Farabi (who died about the middle of the tenth century), among his  accomplishments, excelled in music, in proof of which a curious anecdote  is told. Returning from the pilgrimage to Mecca, he introduced himself,  though a stranger, at the court of Sayfu 'd-Dawla, sultan of Syria, when  a party of musicians chanced to be performing, and he joined them. The  prince admired his skill, and, desiring to hear something of his own,  Al-Farabi unfolded a composition, and distributed the parts amongst the  band. The first movement threw the prince and his courtiers into violent  laughter, the next melted all into tears, and the last lulled even the  performers to sleep. At the retaking of Baghdad by the Turks in 1638,  when the springing of a mine, whereby eight hundred jannisaries  perished, was the signal for a general massacre, and thirty thousand  Persians were put to the sword, a Persian musician named Shah-Kuli, who  was brought before the sultan Murad, played and sang so sweetly, first a  song of triumph, and then a dirge, that the sultan, moved to pity by the  music, gave order to stop the slaughter.    To resume, after this anecdotical digression. Saadi gives this whimsical  piece of advice to a pugnacious fellow: \"Be sure, either that thou art  stronger than thine enemy, or that thou hast a swifter pair of heels.\"  And he relates a droll story in illustration of the use and abuse of the  phrase, \"For the sake of God,\" which is so frequently in the mouths of  Muslims: A harsh-voiced man was reading the Kuran in a loud tone. A  pious man passed by him and said: \"What is thy monthly salary?\" The  other replied: \"Nothing.\" \"Why, then, dost thou give thyself this  trouble?\" \"I read for the sake of God,\" he rejoined. \"Then,\" said the  pious man, \"_for God's sake don't read_.\"    The most esteemed of Saadi's numerous and diversified works is the  _Gulistan_, or Rose-Garden. The first English translation of this work  was made by Francis Gladwin, and published in 1808, and it is a very  scarce book. Other translations have since been issued, but they are  rather costly and the editions limited. It is strange that in these days  of cheap reprints of rare and excellent works of genius no enterprising  publisher should have thought it worth reproduction in a popular form.  It is not one of those ponderous tomes of useless learning which not  even an Act of Parliament could cause to be generally read, and which no  publisher would be so blind to his own interests as to reprint. As  regards its size, the _Gulistan_ is but a small book, but intrinsically  it is indeed a very great book, such as could only be produced by a  great mind, and it comprises more wisdom and wit than a score of old  English folios could together yield to the most devoted reader. Some  querulous persons there are who affect to consider the present as a  shallow age, because, forsooth, huge volumes of learning--each the  labour of a lifetime--are not now produced. But the flood-gates of  knowledge are now wide open, and, no longer confined within the old,  narrow, if deep, channels, learning has spread abroad, like the Nile  during the season of its over-flow. Shallow, it may be, but more widely  beneficial, since its life-giving waters are within the reach of all.    Unlike most of our learned old English authors, Saadi did not cast upon  the world all that came from the rich mine of his genius, dross "]]]
