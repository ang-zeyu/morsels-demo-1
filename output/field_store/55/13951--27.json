A perusal of departmental files reveals that many persons and social  bodies have urged upon the Government the desirability of setting up a  Committee or Commission of Inquiry to go into this subject.    The Minister of Health duly considered the representations made, and  appointed the following Committee to inquire into the question:--      The Hon. W. H. Triggs, M.L.C. (Chairman).    Sir Donald McGavin, Kt., C.M.G., D.S.O., M.D. (Lond.), F.R.C.S. (Eng.).    Sir F. Truby King, Kt., C.M.G., M.B., B.Sc. (Public Health) (Edin.).    J. Sands Elliott, Esq., M.D., Bac. Surg.

Matthews, Esq., Under-Secretary for Justice and Controller-General        of Prisons, &c.    J. Beck, Esq., Officer in Charge, Special Schools Branch, Education        Department.    The function and duty laid upon the Committee was as follows:--        (1.) To inquire and report as to the necessity for special      care and treatment of the feeble-minded and subnormal, and to      propose the general means by which such care and treatment, if      any, should be provided.        (2.) To inquire and report as to the necessity for the      treatment of mental degenerates and persons charged with      sexual offences, and to recommend forms of treatment for the      various types of cases.    The Minister of Health expressed his desire that the Committee should  hear such evidence and representations on the above-mentioned matters as  might be necessary fully to inform the Committee on the questions  referred to it, and further suggested to the Committee that the various  organizations and persons likely to be interested should be notified  that the Committee would, at a certain place and date, hear any evidence  they might desire to tender.    The following places were visited and inspected by the Committee: The  Myers Special School, Auckland; the Waikeria Prison Reformatory; the  Tokanui Mental Hospital, Waikeria; the New Plymouth Prison; the Boys'  Training-farm, Weraroa; the Point Halswell Reformatory for Women,  Wellington; the Special School for Girls, Richmond, Nelson; the Mental  Hospital, Nelson; the Mental Hospital, Stoke, Nelson; the Te Oranga  Home, Burwood, Christchurch; the Paparua Prison, Templeton; the Special  School for Boys, Otekaike; the Caversham Industrial Home for Girls,  Dunedin; the Borstal Institution, Invercargill.

Nedwill, Prison"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18937"],[0,"My First Picture Book (#2)"],[1,"very sad. Once, when she  lost her sheep, she was very doleful indeed. And this is how it  happened.    One summer evening, when the sun was setting, Little Bo-Peep, who had  to rise very early in the morning, felt tired, and sat down on a bank  covered with daisies. Being very weary she soon fell fast asleep. Now  the Bell-wether of Bo-Peep's flock was a most stupid and stubborn  fellow. I dare say you know that all the sheep in a flock will follow  the Bell-wether, and that he always wears a bell round his neck. It  was a great pity, but the Bell-wether of Bo-Peep's flock was very  wild, and was much given to wander far away into the wood, where of  course the rest of the sheep would follow him.    Finding Little Bo-Peep asleep, the tiresome fellow began by standing  on his hind legs and making a great bow to his shadow before him on  the grass. After this he whirled himself round like a top, shaking  his head all the time, and ringing his bell.    [Illustration: Bo-Peep asleep; Bell-wether capering.]    Very soon the rest of the flock began to dance and caper too. And  when they had wheeled round their leader for a time, they ran off  after him with a bound into the wood. Away they went, till they were  quite tired out; and then they came to a stand-still, staring at their  leader with very blank faces. But the Bell-wether looked foolish  enough now, and did nothing but shake his head slowly and ring his  bell, which seemed to say quite clearly, \"You are lost, you are  lost!\"    When Little Bo-Peep awoke she found her sheep gone, and hardly  knowing what she did, she walked on and on, far into the wood. She  met some people with hoes and rakes in their hands, and asked them if  they had seen her sheep. But they only laughed at her, and said, No.  One man was very cross, and threatened to beat her. At last she came  to a stile, on which an old Raven was perched. He looked so wise that  Little Bo-Peep asked him whether he had seen a flock of sheep. But he  only cried \"Caw, caw, caw;\" so Bo-Peep ran on again across the  fields.    [Illustration: Bo-peep and Raven.]    She wandered on till night-fall, and being faint with hunger, was  very glad to see a light just before her. As she went on, she saw  that it shone from a cottage window. But when she came to the door,  it looked so dark and dismal that she was afraid to go in, and was  just going to run away, when a cross-looking old woman came out, and  dragged her into the cottage. She made her sit by the side of her  son, who was a very ugly youth with a great red face and red  hair.    [Illustration: Bo-peep and ugly Youth.]    The old woman told him that she had brought Bo-Peep to be his wife,  so Bo-Peep, who did not like him at all, ran away while they were  asleep. But she did not know where to go, and gave herself up for  lost, when she heard something cry, \"tu-whit--tu-whoo,\" in the  tree above her. It was a great owl, which began flapping its wings  with joy. Bo-Peep was frightened at first, but as the owl seemed very  kind, she followed it. It took her to a cottage were there was plenty  to eat and drink, and then, to Bo-Peep's great surprise, it began to  speak, and told her this story:--    \"Know, dear Maiden,\" said the owl, \"that I am the daughter of a King,  and was a lovely Princess; but I was changed into an owl by the old  woman at the cottage, because I would not marry her ugly son. But I  have heard the fairies say that one day a lovely maiden, who would  come into this wood to find her lost sheep, should be the means of my  gaining my own form again. You are that pretty maid, and I will take  you to a spot where you will find your sheep, but without their  tails. The elves will play with them for this night, but in the  morning every sheep will have its tail again, except the stupid  Bell-wether. You must then wave his tail three times over my head,  and I shall resume my shape again.\"    The owl flew off, and led Bo-Peep into the wood, and said, \"Sleep,  maiden, I will watch.\" How long she was asleep she could not tell,  but the charmed spot was suddenly lighted up, and she saw the Queen  of the Fairies seated on a bank. The Queen said the sheep should be  punished for running away. She then saw all her sheep come trooping  into the place, and on every sheep there was an Elf, who held in his  hand a sheep's tail.    [Illustration: Sheep and Elves.]    After riding them about for some time, and having great fun with  them, the mad sport ceased, and each Elf restored the tail to his  sheep--all but the Bell-wether's, which their leader hid in a  tree. When Bo-Peep awoke, she saw the owl flapping its wings as if  to remind her of her promise; so she fetched the tail, and waved it  three times over its head, when up started the most charming Princess  that ever was seen. The princess gave Bo-Peep a beautiful cottage,  and her sheep never ran away from their kind mistress again.    [Illustration: Bo-peep and Owl.]        THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS.      [Illustration: Little Pig going to market.]    The Little Pig who Went to Market.    There was once a family of Five Little Pigs, and Mrs. Pig, their  mother, loved them all very dearly. Some of these little pigs were  very good, and took a great deal of trouble to please her. The eldest  pig was so active and useful that he was called Mr. Pig. One day he  went to market with his cart full of vegetables, but Rusty, the  donkey, began to show his bad temper before he had gone very far on  the road. All the coaxing and whipping would not make him move. So  Mr. Pig took him out of the shafts, and being very strong, drew the  cart to market himself. When he got there, all the other pigs began  to laugh. But they did not laugh so loudly when Mr. Pig told them  all his struggles on the road. Mr. Pig lost no time in selling  his vegetables, and very soon after Rusty came trotting into the  market-place, and as he now seemed willing to take his place in the  cart, Mr. Pig started for home without delay. When he got there, he  told Mrs. Pig his story, and she called him her best and most worthy  son.    [Illustration: Little Pig with mother.]    The Little Pig who Stayed at Home.    This little pig very much wanted to go with his brother, but as he  was so mischievous that he could not be trusted far away, his mother  made him stay at home, and told him to keep a good fire while she  went out to the miller's to buy some flour. But as soon as he was  alone, instead of learning his lessons, he began to tease the poor  cat. Then he got the bellows, and cut the leather with a knife, so as  to see where the wind came from: and when he could not find this out,  he began to cry. After this he broke all his brother's toys; he  forced the drum-stick through the drum, he tore off the tail from the  kite, and then pulled off the horse's head. And then he went to the  cupboard and ate the jam. When Mrs. Pig came home, she sat down by  the fire, and being very tired, she soon fell asleep. No sooner had  she done so, than this bad little pig got a long handkerchief and  tied her in her chair. But soon she awoke and found out all the  mischief that he had been doing. She saw at once the damage that he  had done to his brother's playthings. So she quickly brought out her  thickest and heaviest birch, and gave this naughty little pig such a  beating as he did not forget for a long time.    [Illustration: Little Pig tying mother to chair.]    [Illustration: Little Pig in Dunce cap.]    The Little Pig who had Roast Beef.    This little pig was a very good and careful fellow. He gave his  mother scarcely any trouble, and always took a pleasure in doing all  she bade him. Here you see him sitting down with clean hands and  face, to some nice roast beef, while his brother, the idle pig, who  is standing on a stool in the corner, with the dunce's cap on, has  none. He sat down and quietly learned his lesson, and asked his  mother to hear him repeat it. And this he did so well that Mrs. Pig  stroked him on the ears and forehead, and called him a good little  pig. After this he asked her to allow him to help her make tea.  He brought everything she wanted, and lifted off the kettle from  the fire, without spilling a drop either on his toes or the carpet.  By-and-bye he went out, after asking his mother's leave, to play with  his hoop. He had not gone far when he saw an old blind pig, who, with  his hat in his hand was crying at the loss of his dog; so he put his  hand in his pocket and found a halfpenny which he gave to the poor  old pig. It was for such thoughtful conduct as this that his mother  often gave this little pig roast beef. We now come to the little pig  who had none.    [Illustration: Little Pig eating roast beef.]    The Little Pig who had None.    This was a most obstinate and wilful little pig. His mother had set  him to learn his lesson, but no sooner had she gone out into the  garden, than he tore his book into pieces. When his mother came back  he ran off into the streets to play with other idle little pigs like  himself. After this he quarrelled with one of the pigs and got a  sound thrashing. Being afraid to go home, he stayed out till it was  quite dark and caught a severe cold. So he was taken home and put to  bed, and had to take a lot of nasty physic.    [Illustration: Little Pig running home.]    The Little Pig who Cried \"Wee, wee,\" all the Way Home.    This little pig went fishing. Now he had been told not to go into  Farmer Grumpey's grounds, who did not allow any one to fish in his  part of the river. But in spite of what he had been told, this  foolish little pig went there. He soon caught a very large fish, and  while he was trying to carry it home, Farmer Grumpey came running  along with his great whip. He quickly dropped the fish, but the  farmer caught him, and as he laid his whip over his back for some  time, the little pig ran off, crying, \"Wee, wee, wee,\" all the way  home."]]]
