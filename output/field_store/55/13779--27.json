The nation was thus evolved out of alien and hostile elements, Irish,  Pictish, Gaelic, Cymric, English, and on the northern and western shores,  Scandinavian.          CHAPTER III.  EARLY WARS OF RACES.      In a work of this scope, it is impossible to describe all the wars  between the petty kingdoms peopled by races of various languages, which  occupied Scotland.  In 603, in the wild moors at Degsastane, between the  Liddel burn and the passes of the Upper Tyne, the English Aethelfrith of  Deira, with an army of the still pagan ancestors of the Borderers,  utterly defeated Aidan, King of Argyll, with the Christian converted  Scots.  Henceforth, for more than a century, the English between Forth  and Humber feared neither Scot of the west nor Pict of the north.    On the death of Aethelfrith (617), the Christian west and north exercised  their influences; one of Aethelfrith's exiled sons married a Pictish  princess, and became father of a Pictish king, another, Oswald, was  baptised at Iona; and the new king of the northern English of Lothian,  Edwin, was converted by Paullinus (627), and held Edinburgh as his  capital.  Later, after an age of war and ruin, Oswald, the convert of  Iona, restored Christianity in northern England; and, after his fall, his  brother, Oswiu, consolidated the north English.  In 685 Oswiu's son  Egfrith crossed the Forth and invaded Pictland with a Northumbrian army,  but was routed with great loss, and was slain at Nectan's Mere, in  Forfarshire.  Thenceforth, till 761, the Picts were dominant, as against  Scots and north English, Angus MacFergus being then their leader (731-  761).    Now the invaders and settlers from Scandinavia, the Northmen on the west  coast, ravaged the Christian Scots of the west, and burned Iona: finally,  in 844-860, Kenneth MacAlpine of Kintyre, a Scot of Dalriada on the  paternal, a Pict on the mother's side, defeated the Picts and obtained  their throne.  By Pictish law the crown descended in the maternal line,  which probably facilitated the coronation of Kenneth.  To the Scots and  \"to all Europe\" he was a Scot; to the Picts, as son of a royal Pictish  mother, he was a Pict.  With him, at all events, Scots and Picts were  interfused, and there began the _Scottish_ dynasty, supplanting the  Pictish, though it is only in popular tales that the Picts were  exterminated.    Owing to pressure from the Northmen sea-rovers in the west, the capital  and the seat of the chief bishop, under Kenneth MacAlpine (844-860), were  moved eastwards from Iona to Scone, near Perth, and after an interval at  Dunkeld, to St Andrews in Fife.    The line of Kenneth MacAlpine, though disturbed by quarrels over the  succession, and by Northmen in the west, north, and east, none the less  in some way \"held a good grip o' the gear\" against Vikings, English of  Lothian, and Welsh of Strathclyde.  In consequence of a marriage with a  Welsh princess of Strathclyde, or Cumberland, a Scottish prince, Donald,  brother of Constantine II., became king of that realm (908), and his  branch of the family of MacAlpin held Cumbria for a century.        ENGLISH CLAIMS OVER SCOTLAND.      In 924 the first claim by an English king, Edward, to the over-lordship  of Scotland appears in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.  The entry contains a  manifest error, and the topic causes war between modern historians,  English and Scottish.  In fact, there are several such entries of  Scottish acceptance of English suzerainty under Constantine II., and  later, but they all end in the statement, \"this held not long.\"  The  \"submission\" of Malcolm I. to Edmund (945) is not a submission but an  alliance; the old English word for \"fellow-worker,\" or \"ally,\" designates  Malcolm as fellow-worker with Edward of England.    This word (midwyrhta) was translated _fidelis_ (one who gives fealty) in  the Latin of English chroniclers two centuries later, but Malcolm I. held  Cumberland as an ally, not as a subject prince of England.  In 1092 an  English chronicle represents Malcolm III. as holding Cumberland \"by  conquest.\"    The main fact is that out of these and similar dim transactions arose the  claims of Edward I. to the over-lordship of Scotland,--claims that were  urged by Queen Elizabeth's minister, Cecil, in 1568, and were boldly  denied by Maitland of Lethington.  From these misty pretensions came the  centuries of war that made the hardy character of the folk of Scotland.  {10}        THE SCOTTISH ACQUISITION OF LOTHIAN.      We cannot pretend within our scope to follow chronologically \"the  fightings and flockings of kites and crows,\" in \"a wolf-age, a war-age,\"  when the Northmen from all Scandinavian lands, and the Danes, who had  acquired much of Ireland, were flying at the throat of England and  hanging on the flanks of Scotland; while the Britons of Strathclyde  struck in, and the Scottish kings again and again raided or sought to  occupy the fertile region of Lothian between Forth and Tweed.  If the  dynasty of MacAlpin could win rich Lothian, with its English-speaking  folk, they were \"made men,\" they held the granary of the North.  By  degrees and by methods not clearly defined they did win the Castle of the  Maidens, the acropolis of Dunedin, Edinburgh; and fifty years later, in  some way, apparently by the sword, at the battle of Carham (1018), in  which a Scottish king of Cumberland fought by his side, Malcolm II. took  possession of Lothian, the whole south-east region, by this time entirely  anglified, and this was the greatest step in the making of Scotland.  The  Celtic dynasty now held the most fertile district between Forth and  Tweed, a district already English in blood and speech, the centre and  focus of the English civilisation accepted by the Celtic kings.  Under  this Malcolm, too, his grandson, Duncan, became ruler of Strathclyde--that  is, practically, of Cumberland.    Malcolm is said to have been murdered at haunted Glamis, in Forfarshire,  in 1034; the room where he died is pointed out by legend in the ancient  castle.  His rightful heir, by the strange system of the Scots, should  have been, not his own grandson, Duncan, but the grandson of Kenneth III.  The rule was that the crown went alternately to a descendant of the House  of Constantine (863-877), son of Kenneth MacAlpine, and to a descendant  of Constantine's brother, Aodh (877-888).  These alternations went on  till the crowning of Malcolm II. (1005-1034), and then ceased, for  Malcolm II. had slain the unnamed male heir of the House of Aodh, a son  of Boedhe, in order to open the succession to his own grandson, \"the  gracious Duncan.\"  Boedhe had left a daughter, Gruach; she had by the  Mormaor, or under-king of the province of Murray, a son, Lulach.  On the  death of the Mormaor she married Macbeth, and when Macbeth slew Duncan  (1040), he was removing a usurper--as he understood it--and he ruled in  the name of his stepson, Lulach.  The power of Duncan had been weakened  by repeated defeats at the hands of the Northmen under Thorfinn.  In 1057  Macbeth was slain in battle at Lumphanan, in Aberdeenshire, and Malcolm  Canmore, son of Duncan, after returning from England, whither he had fled  from Macbeth, succeeded to the throne.  But he and his descendants for  long were opposed by the House of Murray, descendants of Lulach, who  himself had died in 1058.    The world will always believe Shakespeare's version of these events, and  suppose the gracious Duncan to have been a venerable old man, and Macbeth  an ambitious Thane, with a bloodthirsty wife, he himself being urged on  by the predictions of witches.  He was, in fact, Mormaor of Murray, and  upheld the claims of his stepson Lulach, who was son of a daughter of the  wrongfully extruded House of Aodh.    Malcolm Canmore, Duncan's grandson, on the other hand, represented the  European custom of direct lineal succession against the ancient Scots'  mode.          CHAPTER IV.  MALCOLM CANMORE--NORMAN CONQUEST.      The reign of Malcolm Canmore (1057-1093) brought Scotland into closer  connection with western Europe and western Christianity.  The Norman  Conquest (1066) increased the tendency of the English-speaking people of  Lothian to acquiesce in the rule of a Celtic king, rather than in that of  the adventurers who followed William of Normandy.  Norman operations did  not at first reach Cumberland, which Malcolm held; and, on the death of  his Norse wife, the widow of Duncan's foe, Thorfinn (she left a son,  Duncan), Malcolm allied himself with the English Royal House by marrying  Margaret, sister of Eadgar AEtheling, then engaged in the hopeless effort  to rescue northern England from the Normans.  The dates are confused:  Malcolm may have won the beautiful sister of Edgar, rightful king of  England, in 1068, or at the time (1070) of his raid, said to have been of  savage ferocity, into Northumberland, and his yet more cruel reprisals  for Gospatric's harrying of Cumberland.  In either case, St Margaret's  biographer, who had lived at her Court, whether or not he was her  Confessor, Turgot, represents the Saint as subduing the savagery of  Malcolm, who passed wakeful nights in weeping for his sins.  A lover of  books, which Malcolm could not read, an expert in \"the delicate, and  gracious, and bright works of women,\" Margaret brought her own gentleness  and courtesy among a rude people, built the abbey church of Dunfermline,  and presented the churches with many beautiful golden reliquaries and  fine sacramental plate.    In 1072, to avenge a raid of Malcolm (1070), the Conqueror, with an army  and a fleet, came to Abernethy on Tay, where Malcolm, in exchange for  English manors, \"became his man\" _for them_, and handed over his son  Duncan as a hostage for peace.  The English view is that Malcolm became  William's \"man for all that he had\"--or for all south of Tay.

So now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the  procession, through the streets of his capital; and all the people  standing by, and those at the windows, cried out, \"Oh! How beautiful  are our Emperor's new clothes! What a magnificent train there is to  the mantle; and how gracefully the scarf hangs!\" in short, no one would  allow that he could not see these much-admired clothes; because, in  doing so, he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit  for his office. Certainly, none of the Emperor's various suits, had ever  made so great an impression, as these invisible ones.    \"But the Emperor has nothing at all on!\" said a little child.    \"Listen to the voice of innocence!\" exclaimed his father; and what the  child had said was whispered from one to another.    \"But he has nothing at all on!\" at last cried out all the people.  The Emperor was vexed, for he knew that the people were right; but he  thought the procession must go on now! And the lords of the bedchamber  took greater pains than ever, to appear holding up a train, although, in  reality, there was no train to hold.          THE SWINEHERD    There was once a poor Prince, who had a kingdom. His kingdom was very  small, but still quite large enough to marry upon; and he wished to  marry.    It was certainly rather cool of him to say to the Emperor's daughter,  \"Will you have me?\" But so he did; for his name was renowned far and  wide; and there were a hundred princesses who would have answered,  \"Yes!\" and \"Thank you kindly.\" We shall see what this princess said.    Listen!    It happened that where the Prince's father lay buried, there grew a rose  tree--a most beautiful rose tree, which blossomed only once in every  five years, and even then bore only one flower, but that was a rose!  It smelt so sweet that all cares and sorrows were forgotten by him who  inhaled its fragrance.    And furthermore, the Prince had a nightingale, who could sing in such a  manner that it seemed as though all sweet melodies dwelt in her little  throat. So the Princess was to have the rose, and the nightingale; and  they were accordingly put into large silver caskets, and sent to her.    The Emperor had them brought into a large hall, where the Princess was  playing at \"Visiting,\" with the ladies of the court; and when she saw  the caskets with the presents, she clapped her hands for joy.    \"Ah, if it were but a little pussy-cat!\" said she; but the rose tree,  with its beautiful rose came to view.    \"Oh, how prettily it is made!\" said all the court ladies.    \"It is more than pretty,\" said the Emperor, \"it is charming!\"    But the Princess touched it, and was almost ready to cry.    \"Fie, papa!\" said she. \"It is not made at all, it is natural!\"    \"Let us see what is in the other casket, before we get into a bad  humor,\" said the Emperor. So the nightingale came forth and sang so  delightfully that at first no one could say anything ill-humored of her.    \"Superbe! Charmant!\" exclaimed the ladies; for they all used to chatter  French, each one worse than her neighbor.    \"How much the bird reminds me of the musical box that belonged to our  blessed Empress,\" said an old knight. \"Oh yes! These are the same tones,  the same execution.\"    \"Yes! yes!\" said the Emperor, and he wept like a child at the  remembrance.    \"I will still hope that it is not a real bird,\" said the Princess.    \"Yes, it is a real bird,\" said those who had brought it. \"Well then let  the bird fly,\" said the Princess; and she positively refused to see the  Prince.    However, he was not to be discouraged; he daubed his face over brown and  black; pulled his cap over his ears, and knocked at the door.    \"Good day to my lord, the Emperor!\" said he. \"Can I have employment at  the palace?\"    \"Why, yes,\" said the Emperor. \"I want some one to take care of the pigs,  for we have a great many of them.\"    So the Prince was appointed \"Imperial Swineherd.\" He had a dirty little  room close by the pigsty; and there he sat the whole day, and worked. By  the evening he had made a pretty little kitchen-pot. Little bells were  hung all round it; and when the pot was boiling, these bells tinkled in  the most charming manner, and played the old melody,        \"Ach! du lieber Augustin,      Alles ist weg, weg, weg!\"*        * \"Ah! dear Augustine!      All is gone, gone, gone!\"      But what was still more curious, whoever held his finger in the smoke of  the kitchen-pot, immediately smelt all the dishes that were cooking on  every hearth in the city--this, you see, was something quite different  from the rose.    Now the Princess happened to walk that way; and when she heard the tune,  she stood quite still, and seemed pleased; for she could play \"Lieber  Augustine\"; it was the only piece she knew; and she played it with one  finger.    \"Why there is my piece,\" said the Princess. \"That swineherd must  certainly have been well educated! Go in and ask him the price of the  instrument.\"    So one of the court-ladies must run in; however, she drew on wooden  slippers first.    \"What will you take for the kitchen-pot?\" said the lady.    \"I will have ten kisses from the Princess,\" said the swineherd.    \"Yes, indeed!\" said the lady.    \"I cannot sell it for less,\" rejoined the swineherd.    \"He is an impudent fellow!\" said the Princess, and she walked on; but  when she had gone a little way, the bells tinkled so prettily        \"Ach! du lieber Augustin,      Alles ist weg, weg, weg!\"    \"Stay,\" said the Princess. \"Ask him if he will have ten kisses from the  ladies of my court.\"    \"No, thank you!\" said the swineherd. \"Ten kisses from the Princess, or I  keep the kitchen-pot myself.\"    \"That must not be, either!\" said the Princess. \"But do you all stand  before me that no one may see us.\"    And the court-ladies placed themselves in front of her, and spread  out their dresses--the swineherd got ten kisses, and the Princess--the  kitchen-pot.    That was delightful! The pot was boiling the whole evening, and the  whole of the following day. They knew perfectly well what was cooking at  every fire throughout the city, from the chamberlain's to the cobbler's;  the court-ladies danced and clapped their hands.    \"We know who has soup, and who has pancakes for dinner to-day, who has  cutlets, and who has eggs. How interesting!\"    \"Yes, but keep my secret, for I am an Emperor's daughter.\"    The swineherd--that is to say--the Prince, for no one knew that he was  other than an ill-favored swineherd, let not a day pass without working  at something; he at last constructed a rattle, which, when it was swung  round, played all the waltzes and jig tunes, which have ever been heard  since the creation of the world.    \"Ah, that is superbe!\" said the Princess when she passed by. \"I have  never heard prettier compositions! Go in and ask him the price of the  instrument; but mind, he shall have no more kisses!\"    \"He will have a hundred kisses from the Princess!\" said the lady who had  been to ask.    \"I think he is not in his right senses!\" said the Princess, and walked  on, but when she had gone a little way, she stopped again. \"One must  encourage art,\" said she, \"I am the Emperor's daughter. Tell him he  shall, as on yesterday, have ten kisses from me, and may take the rest  from the ladies of the court.\"    \"Oh--but we should not like that at all!\" said they. \"What are you  muttering?\" asked the Princess. \"If I can kiss him, surely you can.  Remember that you owe everything to me.\" So the ladies were obliged to  go to him again.    \"A hundred kisses from the Princess,\" said he, \"or else let everyone  keep his own!\"    \"Stand round!\" said she; and all the ladies stood round her whilst the  kissing was going on.    \"What can be the reason for such a crowd close by the pigsty?\" said the  Emperor, who happened just then to step out on the balcony; he rubbed  his eyes, and put on his spectacles. \"They are the ladies of the  court; I must go down and see what they are about!\" So he pulled up his  slippers at the heel, for he had trodden them down.    As soon as he had got into the court-yard, he moved very softly, and the  ladies were so much engrossed with counting the kisses, that all might  go on fairly, that they did not perceive the Emperor. He rose on his  tiptoes.    \"What is all this?\" said he, when he saw what was going on, and he boxed  the Princess's ears with his slipper, just as the swineherd was taking  the eighty-sixth kiss.    \"March out!\" said the Emperor, for he was very angry; and both Princess  and swineherd were thrust out of the city.    The Princess now stood and wept, the swineherd scolded, and the rain  poured down.    \"Alas! Unhappy creature that I am!\" said the Princess. \"If I had but  married the handsome young Prince! Ah! how unfortunate I am!\"    And the swineherd went behind a tree, washed the black and brown color  from his face, threw off his dirty clothes, and stepped forth in his  princely robes; he looked so noble that the Princess could not help  bowing before him.    \"I am come to despise thee,\" said he. \"Thou would'st not have an  honorable Prince! Thou could'st not prize the rose and the nightingale,  but thou wast ready to kiss the swineherd for the sake of a trumpery  plaything. Thou art rightly served.\"    He then went back to his own little kingdom, and shut the door of his  palace in her face. Now she might well sing,        \"Ach! du lieber Augustin,      Alles ist weg, weg, weg!\"          THE REAL PRINCESS    There was once a Prince who wished to marry a Princess; but then she  must be a real Princess. He travelled all over the world in hopes of  finding such a lady; but there was always something wrong. Princesses he  found in plenty; but whether they were real Princesses it was impossible  for him to decide, for now one thing, now another, seemed to him not  quite right about the ladies. At last he returned to his palace"]]]
