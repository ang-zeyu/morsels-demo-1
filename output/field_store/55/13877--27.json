Heaven knows where he was!    Gulo appeared quite suddenly and very early, for him, next afternoon,  beside some tangled brush on the edge of a clearing.  He was sitting  up, almost bolt-upright, and he was shading his eyes with his forepaws.  A man could not have done more.  And, in fact, he did not look like an  animal at all, but like some diabolically uncouth dwarf of the woods.    A squirrel was telling him, from a branch near by, just what everybody  thought of his disgraceful appearance; and two willow-grouse were  clucking at him from some hazel-tops; whilst a raven, black as coal  against the white of the woods, jabbed in gruff and very rude remarks  from time to time.    But Gulo was taking no notice of them.  He was used to attentions of  that kind; it was a little compliment--of hate--they all paid him.  He  was looking persistently down the ranked, narrowing perspective of the  buttressed forest glade to where it faded in the blue-gray mist,  southward, as if he expected something to come from there.  Something  was coming from there now; and there had been a faint, uneasy sort of  whisper in that direction for some time.  Now it was unmistakable.    A cow-elk, first of the wary ones to move on alarm, came trotting by,  her Roman nose held well out; a red-deer hind, galloping lightly like  some gigantic hare, her big ears turned astern; a wolf, head up,  hackles alift, alternately loping and pivoting, to listen and look  back, a wild reindeer, trotting heavily, but far more quickly than he  seemed to be--all these passed, now on one side, now on the other,  often only glimpses between the tree-boles, while the wolverine sat up  and shaded his eyes with his paws.  Something was moving those beasts,  those haunters of the forest, and no little thing either.  Something?  What?      Very softly down the glade runs a waiting, watching shade,      And the whisper spreads and widens far and near;    And the sweat is on thy brow, for he passes even now--      He is Fear, O Little Hunter, he is Fear.      Down came Gulo in that grim silence which was, except for his domestic  arguments, characteristic of the beast, and trotted to a pool hard by.  The pool was spring-fed, and covered, as to every dead leaf and stone,  with fine green moss of incomparable softness.  He drank swiftly and  long, then flung about with a half-insolent, half-aggressive wave of  his tail, and set off at a rolling, clumsy, shuffling shamble.    At ordinary times that deceiving gait would have left nearly everything  behind, but this afternoon it was different.  Gulo had barely shed the  shelter of the dotted thickets before he realized, and one saw, the  fact.  He broke his trot.  He began to plunge.  Nevertheless, he got  along.  There was pace, of a sort.  Certainly there was much effort.  He would have outdistanced you or me easily in no time, but it was not  you or I that came, and who could tell how fast that something might  travel?    The trouble was the snow--that was the rub, and a very big and serious  rub, too, for him.  Now, if the snow had been a little less it would  not have mattered--a little more, and he could have run easily along  the hard crust of it; but it was as it was, only about two feet, just  enough to retard him, and no more.  And it is then, when the snow is  like that, just above a couple of feet deep, that man can overtake  friend wolverine--if he knows the way.  Most men don't.  On that he  trusted.  At any other time--but this was not any other time.    Sound carries a long way in those still parts, and as he hurried Gulo  heard, far, far behind in the forest, the faint, distant whir of a  cock-capercailzie--the feathered giant of the woods--rising.  It was  only a whisper, almost indistinguishable to our ears, but enough, quite  enough, for him.  Taken in conjunction with the mysterious shifting of  the elk and the red deer and the reindeer and the wolf, it was more  than enough.  He increased his pace, and for the first time fear shone  in his eyes--it was for the first time, too, in his life, I think.    A lynx passed him, bounding along on enormous, furry legs.  It looked  all legs, and as it turned its grinning countenance to look at him he  cursed it fluently, with a sudden savage growl, envious, perhaps, of  its long, springing hindlegs.  Something, too--the same something--must  have moved the lynx, and Gulo shifted the faster for the knowledge.    Half-an-hour passed, an hour slid by, and all the time Gulo kicked the  miles behind him, with that dogged persistency that was part of his  character.  Nothing had passed him for quite a while, and he was all  alone in the utterly still, silent forest and the snow, pad-pad-padding  along like a moving, squat machine rather than a beast.    At last he stopped, and, spinning round, sat up.  A gray-blue haze,  like the color on a wood-pigeon, was creeping over everything, except  in the west, where the sky held a faint, luminous, pinky tinge that  foretold frost.  It was very cold, and the snow, which had never quite  left off, was falling now only in single, big, wandering flakes.  The  silence was almost terrifying.    Then, as Gulo sat up, from far away, but not quite so far away, his  rounded ears, almost buried in fur, caught faintly--very, very  faintly--a sound that brought him down on all fours, and sent him away  again at a gallop with a strange new light burning in his little,  wide-set eyes.  It was the unmistakable sound of a horse  sneezing--once.  Gulo did not wait to hear if it sneezed twice.  He was  gone in an instant.  Man, it seemed, had not been long in answering  that challenge of the _cache_ escapade.    After that there was no such thing as time at all, only an everlasting  succession of iron-hard tree-trunks sliding by, and shadows--they ran  when they saw him, some of them, or gathered to stare with eyes that  glinted--dancing past.  The moon came and hung itself up in the  heavens, mocking him with a pitiless, stark glare.  (He would have  given his right forepaw for a black night and a blinding snowstorm.)  It almost seemed as if they were all laughing at him, Gulo the dreaded,  the hated hater, because it was his turn at last, who had so freely  dealt in it, to know fear.    Hours passed certainly, hours upon hours, and still, his breath coming  quickly and less easily now with every mile, Gulo stuck to the job of  putting the landscape behind him with that grim pertinacity of his that  was almost fine.    At last the trees stopped abruptly, and he was heading, straighter than  crows fly, across a plain.  The plain undulated a little, like a sea, a  dead sea, of spotless white, with nothing alive upon it--only his  hunched, slouching, untidy, squat form and his shadow, \"pacing\" him.  At the top of the highest undulation he stopped, and glowered back  along the trail.    Ahead, the forest, starting again, showed as a black band a quarter of  an inch high.  Behind, the forest he had already left lay dwarfed in a  ruled, serried line.  But that was not all.  Something was moving out  upon the spotless plain of snow, something which appeared to be no more  than crawling, ant-like, but was really traveling very fast.  It looked  like a smudged dot, nothing more; but it was a horse, really, galloping  hard, with a light sleigh, and a man in it, behind.  The horse had no  bells, and it was not a reindeer as usual.  Pace was wanted here, and  the snow was not deep enough to impede the horse, who possessed the  required speed under such conditions.    The horse had been trotting along the trail, till it came to the place  where Gulo had looked back and heard the sneeze, and knew he was being  followed.  Then it had started to gallop, and, with ears back and teeth  showing, had never ceased to gallop.  This, apparently, was not the  first wolverine that horse had trailed.  It seemed to have a personal  grudge against the whole fell clan of wolverine, and to be bent upon  trampling Gulo to death.    Gulo watched it for about one quarter of a second.  Then he quitted,  and the speed he had put up previously was nothing to that which he  showed now--uselessly.  And, far behind him, the man in the sleigh drew  out his rifle from under the fur rugs.  He judged that the time had  about come.  The end was very near.    But he judged wrong.  Gulo made the wood at length.  With eyes of dull  red, and breath coming in short, rending sobs, he got in among the  trees.  He did it, though the feat seemed impossible, for the trees had  been so very far away.  Got in among the trees--yes, but dead-beat,  and--to what end?  To be \"treed\" ignominiously and calmly shot down,  picked off like a squirrel on a larch-pole.  That was all.  And that  was the orthodox end, the end the man took for granted.    In a few minutes the horse was in the forest too, was close behind  Gulo.  In spite of the muffling effect of snow, his expectant ears  could hear the quadruple thud of the galloping hoofs, and--    Hup!  Whuff!  Biff-biff!  Grrrrrr!  Grr-ur-ururrh!  Grrrr-urr!    It had all happened quick as a flash of light.  A huge, furry, reeking  mass rising right in the wolverine's path from behind a tree, towering  over him, almost mountainous to his eyes, like the very shape of doom!  Himself hurling sideways, and rolling over and over, snarling, to  prevent the crowning disaster of collision with this terrible portent!  A blow, two blows, with enormous paws whose claws gleamed like skewers,  whistling half-an-inch above his ducked head!  Jaws, monstrous and wet,  grabbing at him in enraged confusion, and rumblings deep down in the  inside of the thing that ran cold lightning-sparks all up his spine.  That was what Gulo saw and heard.    The wolverine rolled, clawing and biting, three times, and without a  pause sprang to his feet again, and leapt madly"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17571"],[0,"Piano Tuning: A Simple and Accurate Method for Amateurs (#2)"],[1,"prepared, to  have all students prepare two lessons in harmony as a test of their  acquaintance with the intervals and chords used in tuning. The lessons  are not difficult, and they embody only those principles which are  essential to the proper understanding of the key-board: the intervals  of the diatonic scale and the major common chord in the twelve  different keys, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, B-flat, D-flat, E-flat, G-flat,  and A-flat. In connection with the harmony lessons, we use as a  text-book \"Clarke's Harmony,\"[A] and the student is required to master  the first two chapters and prepare manuscripts upon each of the  lessons. Below is a number of the most important questions selected  from those lessons upon which manuscripts have been written:         1. Every white key on the piano represents an \"absolute pitch.\"       By what names are these pitches known? How are the black keys       named?         2. How many tones constitute the diatonic scale? Give numerical       names.         3. Intervals are measured by steps and half-steps. How many steps       from 1 to 3 in the diatonic scale? 1 to 4? 1 to 5? 3 to 5? 5 to       8? 1 to 8?         4. Why is there no black key between E and F, and between B and       C?         5. From 1 to 3 is called an interval of a third; from 3 to 5,       also a third; from 1 to 5, a fifth: they are so called because       they include, respectively, three and five members of the       diatonic scale. What is the interval 3 to 6? 2 to 5? 5 to 8? 2 to       6? 1 to 8?         6. Thirds are of two kinds: major (larger) thirds embrace two       whole-steps; minor (smaller) thirds embrace a step and a half.       What kind of a third is 1-3 in the diatonic scale? 2-4? 3-5? 6-8?         7. What do we mean by the term, Fundamental of a chord? What is       added to it to complete the common chord?         8. What absolute pitches comprise the common chord of C? What       kind of interval between the first two members? What between the       first and last? What between the second and last?         9. What tones would you use if told to strike the common chord of       C in four-part, close harmony, using the fundamental for the       highest tone?         10. How many keys (white and black) are there between the       fundamental and the third? How many between the third and the       fifth? How many between the fundamental and the fifth when the       fifth is played above the fundamental?         11. How many keys (white and black) are there between two keys       comprising a perfect fourth?         12. (Most important of all.) What keys of the piano keyboard       comprise the common chord founded upon G as the fundamental? Upon       F? Upon F[#]? Upon G[#]? Upon B[b]? Upon D[b]? Upon E[b]? Upon D?       Upon E? Upon A? Upon B?    If one is able to answer these questions correctly he is qualified to  begin the study of Piano Tuning.        [A] Published by Theodore Presser, Philadelphia, Pa.          LESSON II.    ~GENERAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE PIANO; SOMETHING OF ITS EVOLUTION AND  HISTORY.~      The piano of today is, unquestionably, the most perfect, and  consequently the most popular and beloved of all musical instruments.        That enchanting Queen of the home,        Whose place in the hearts of the family      Is as dear as though it could speak        In words of joy and sorrow,      Sadness or consolation;        Soothing, animating, enrapturing,      Charming away the soul        From its worldly weight of cares,      And wafting it softly        Into the realm of celestial dreams.    The untiring efforts of genius for over a century have succeeded in  producing a musical instrument that falls little short of perfection.  Yet other inventions and improvements are sure to come, for we are  never content with \"good enough.\"    The student of these lessons may, in his practice, discover defective  mechanical action and by his ingenuity be able to improve it; he may  likewise see where an improvement can be made in acoustic  construction; where a better scale can be drawn; or where different  and perhaps new materials may be used for the component parts of the  instrument. The possibilities are numerous along these lines, and in  addition to bestowing a favor upon the general public, the man who has  the originality to produce something new, places himself beyond want.    The inevitable inference is that the piano is an evolution of the harp  principle. This instrument was known centuries previous to the  Christian era. From the best history obtainable, we learn that about  three hundred years ago, the first effort was made to interpose a  mechanical contrivance between the performer and the strings whereby  it would only be necessary to strike the keys to produce tone from the  strings, thereby decreasing the difficulty in finding the strings and  picking them with the fingers, and greatly increasing the  possibilities in musical rendition.    History gives credit to Italy for the first productions of this kind,  about 1600 A.D., when the faculty of music was beginning to manifest  itself more boldly. Scientists saw that wonderful developments were  possible, and we have reason to believe that experiments were made in  England, France, Germany and all civilized countries about this time,  for the production of the instrument which we call, in this day, a  Pianoforte. (_Piano e forte_: soft and loud.)    At this time communication between the different countries was, of  course, slow and uncertain, and experiments of this kind were probably  unknown outside of the immediate neighborhood in which they were  tried; therefore, much valuable and interesting history has not come  to light. However, from the specimens which we have had the pleasure  of seeing, and some of which we have had the opportunity to work on,  we infer that about the same line of difficulties presented themselves  to all of these early experimenters, most of which were not  efficiently overcome until in the last century, and the most important  of which it fell to the lot of American inventors to overcome.    Some of these early instruments were not even provided with dampers  for stopping the tone when the key was released; consequently, when a  number of keys were struck in succession, the tone continued from  all, so long as the strings would vibrate. The strings and sound-board  being very light, the sustaining qualities were meager compared to  those of the modern piano; consequently the dampers were not so much  missed as they would be if removed from a modern upright or grand,  which would surely render them unfit for use.    In the first attempts at piano building, the difficulties to be  overcome may be enumerated as follows: The frames were not strong  enough to resist the tension of the strings; they were made almost  entirely of wood which yields to the pull of the strings and is  subject to climatic changes; the scale was very imperfect, that is,  the length, tension and weight of the strings were not properly  proportioned, the result being a different quality of tone from  different portions of the keyboard; the actions were either heavy and  imperfect, or too light to produce sufficient vibration; the proper  point upon the strings for the hammers to strike and for the dampers  to bear had not yet been ascertained; the preparation and seasoning of  the wood for the different parts of the instrument had not received  sufficient attention.    One cannot conceive how difficult it is to produce something that has  never existed, until he tries. The requirements necessary to such  results as are obtainable from the modern piano are numerous and rigid  and the result of many costly experiments.    Probably the most important essential in piano building is the  production of a frame of such strength and stability that the enormous  tension of the strings is completely resisted in all parts of the  scale. In many of the cheaper pianos of this day, the lack of this  essential manifests itself in an annoying degree to the piano tuner.  In tuning, the workman \"brings up\" his temperament in the middle of  the instrument; in most cases the temperament stands all right. He  next tunes the treble, then the bass; after doing his work perfectly  he will often find that the treble fell somewhat while he was bringing  up the bass; or, in a few cases, he may find that the treble  sharpened, thus showing that there was yielding of the frame. Of  course, this defect might be overcome by using an extremely heavy  metal plate and wooden frame; but the commercial side of the question,  in this day, calls for lightness in the instrument as a check to the  expense of production, and, consequently, pianos that are \"made to  sell\" are often much too light to fulfil this requirement.    In the upright piano, the back frame of wood is first made; at the top  of this is the pin-block, sometimes called the wrest-plank. This is  composed of several layers of wood firmly glued together with the  grain running in different directions to prevent splitting and  warping. Into this plank the tuning pins are driven. The sound-board  is fitted firmly into this frame of wood below the pin-block.    Next, the strong metal plate is secured to the frame by large bolts  and screws. Openings are left in the plate for the bridges, which  project from the sound-board beyond the metal plate; also for the  tuning pins, action bracket bolts, etc.    At the lower end of the plate, and just below the bridges,[B] the  hitchpins are driven firmly into holes drilled to receive them. Their  purpose is to support the lower ends of the strings. The bass strings  are separate, and each has a loop with which to fasten it to the  hitchpin. In the treble, one piece of wire forms two strings; the two  ends are secured to the tuning pins above, and the string is simply  brought around the hitchpin. The bridges communicating with the"]]]
