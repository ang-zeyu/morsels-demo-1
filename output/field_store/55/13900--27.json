Columbus tries to get help in carrying out his plans.--Columbus  was too poor to fit out even a single ship to undertake such a voyage  as he had planned. He asked the king of Portugal to furnish some money  or vessels toward it, but he received no encouragement. At length  he determined to go to Spain and see if he could get help there.    On the southern coast of Spain there is a small port named Palos.[9]  Within sight of the village of Palos, and also within plain sight  of the ocean, there was a convent,[10]--which is still  standing,--called the Convent of Saint Mary.    One morning a tall, fine-looking man, leading a little boy by the  hand, knocked at the door of this convent and begged for a piece of  bread and a cup of water for the child. The man was Columbus,--whose  wife was now dead,--and the boy was his son.    It chanced that the guardian of the convent noticed Columbus standing  at the door. He liked his appearance, and coming up, began to talk  with him. Columbus frankly told him what he was trying to do. The  guardian of the convent listened with great interest; then he gave  him a letter to a friend who he thought would help him to lay his  plans before Ferdinand and Isabella,[11] the king and queen of Spain.    [Footnote 9: Palos (Pa'los); see map in paragraph 12.]    [Footnote 10: Convent: a house in which a number of people live who  devote themselves to a religious life.]    [Footnote 11: Isabella (Iz-ah-bel'ah).]      7. Columbus gets help for his great voyage.--Columbus left his son  at the convent, and set forward on his journey full of bright hopes.  But Ferdinand and Isabella could not then see him; and after waiting  a long time, the traveller was told that he might go before a number  of learned men and tell them about his proposed voyage across the  Atlantic.    After hearing what Columbus had to say, these men thought that it  would be foolish to spend money in trying to reach the other side  of the ocean.    People who heard what this captain from Lisbon wanted to do began  to think that he had lost his reason, and the boys in the streets  laughed at him and called him crazy. Columbus waited for help seven  years; he then made up his mind that he would wait no longer. Just  as he was about leaving Spain, Queen Isabella, who had always felt  interested in the brave sailor, resolved to aid him. Two rich  sea-captains who lived in Palos also decided to take part in the  voyage. With the assistance which Columbus now got he was able to  fit out three small vessels. He went in the largest of the  vessels--the only one which had an entire deck--as admiral[12] or  commander of the fleet.    [Footnote 12: Admiral (ad'mi-ral).]      8. Columbus sails.--Early on Friday morning, August 3d, 1492,  Columbus started from Palos to attempt to cross that ocean which men  then called the \"Sea of Darkness,\"--a name which showed how little  they knew of it, and how much they dreaded it.    We may be pretty sure that the guardian of the convent was one of  those who watched the sailing of the little fleet. From the upper  windows of the convent he could plainly see the vessels as they left  the harbor of Palos.    [Illustration: COLUMBUS LEAVING PALOS, AUGUST 3D, 1492.]      9. What happened on the first part of the voyage.--Columbus sailed  first for the Canary Islands, because from there it would be a  straight line, as he thought, across to Japan and Asia. He was obliged  to stop at the Canaries[13] more than three weeks, in order to make  a new rudder for one of his vessels and to alter the sails of another.    At length all was ready, and he again set out on his voyage toward  the west. When the sailors got so far out on the ocean that they could  no longer see any of the islands, they were overcome with fear. They  made up their minds that they should never be able to get back to  Palos again. They were rough men, used to the sea, but now they bowed  down their heads and cried like children. Columbus had hard work to  quiet their fears and to encourage them to go forward with the voyage  which they already wanted to give up.    [Footnote 13: Canaries (Ka-na'rez); see map in paragraph 12.]      10. What happened after they had been at sea many days.--For more  than thirty days the three ships kept on their way toward the west.  To the crew every day seemed a year. From sunrise to sunset nothing  was to be seen but water and sky. At last the men began to think that  they were sailing on an ocean which had no end. They whispered among  themselves that Columbus had gone mad, and that if they kept on with  him in command they should all be lost.    Twice, indeed, there was a joyful cry of Land! Land! but when they  got nearer they saw that what they had thought was land was nothing  but banks of clouds. Then some of the sailors said, Let us go to the  admiral and tell him that we must turn back. What if he will not listen  to us? asked others; Then we will throw him overboard and say when  we reach Palos that he fell into the sea and was drowned.    But when the crew went to Columbus and told him that they would go  no further, he sternly ordered them to their work, declaring that  whatever might happen, he would not now give up the voyage.      11. Signs of land.--The very next day such certain signs of land were  seen that the most faint-hearted took courage. The men had already  noticed great flocks of land-birds flying toward the west, as if to  guide them. Now some of the men on one vessel saw a branch of a  thorn-bush float by. It was plain that it had not long been broken  off from the bush, and it was full of red berries.    But one of the crew on the other vessel found something better even  than the thorn-branch; for he drew out of the water a carved  walking-stick. Every one saw that such a stick must have been cut  and carved by human hands. These two signs could not be doubted. The  men now felt sure that they were approaching the shore, and what was  more, that there were people living in that strange country.      12. Discovery of land.--That evening Columbus begged his crew to keep  a sharp lookout, and he promised a velvet coat to the one who should  first see land. All was now excitement; and no man closed his eyes  in sleep that night.    Columbus himself stood on a high part of his ship, looking steadily  toward the west. About ten o'clock he saw a moving light; it seemed  like a torch carried in a man's hand. He called to a companion and  asked him if he could see anything of the kind; yes, he, too, plainly  saw the moving light, but presently it disappeared.    Two hours after midnight a cannon was fired from the foremost vessel.  It was the glad signal that the long-looked-for land was actually  in sight. There it lay directly ahead, about six miles away.    [Illustration: Map showing the direction in which Columbus sailed  on his great voyage across the ocean.]    Then Columbus gave the order to furl sails, and the three vessels  came to a stop and waited for the dawn. When the sun rose on Friday,  October 12th, 1492, Columbus saw a beautiful island with many trees  growing on it. That was his first sight of the New World.      13. Columbus lands on the island and names it; who lived on the  island.--Attended by the captains of the other two vessels, and by  their crews, Columbus set out in a boat for the island. When they  landed, all fell on their knees, kissed the ground for joy, and gave  thanks to God. Columbus named the island San Salvador[14] and took  possession of it, by right of discovery, for the king and queen of  Spain.    [Illustration: LANDING OF COLUMBUS.]    He found that it was inhabited by a copper-colored people who spoke  a language he could not understand. These people had never seen a  ship or a white man before. They wore no clothing, but painted their  bodies with bright colors. The Spaniards made them presents of  strings of glass beads and red caps. In return they gave the Spaniards  skeins of cotton yarn, tame parrots, and small ornaments of gold.    After staying here a short time Columbus set sail toward the south,  in search of more land and in the hope of finding out where these  people got their gold.    [Footnote 14: San Salvador (San Sal-va-dor'): meaning the Holy  Redeemer or Saviour.]      14. Columbus names the group of islands and their people.--As  Columbus sailed on, he saw many islands in every direction. He  thought that they must be a part of the Indies which he was seeking.  Since he had reached them by coming west from Spain, he called them  the West Indies, and to the red men who lived on them he gave the  name of Indians.      15. Columbus discovers two very large islands; his vessel is wrecked,  and he returns to Spain in another.--In the course of the next six  weeks Columbus discovered the island of Cuba. At first he thought  that it must be Japan, but afterward he came to the conclusion that  it was not an island at all, but part of the mainland of Asia.    Next, he came to the island of Hayti,[15] or San Domingo.[16] Here  his ship was wrecked. He took the timber of the wreck and built a  fort on the shore. Leaving about forty of his crew in this fort,  Columbus set sail for Palos in one of the two remaining vessels.    [Footnote 15: Hayti (Ha'ti).]    [Footnote 16: San Domingo (San Do-min'go); see map in paragraph 17.]      16. Columbus arrives at Palos; joy of the people; how Ferdinand and  Isabella received him.--When the vessel of Columbus was seen  entering the harbor of Palos, the whole village was wild with  excitement. More than seven months had gone by since he sailed away  from that port, and as nothing had been heard from him, many supposed  that the vessels and all on board were lost. Now that they saw their  friends and neighbors coming back, all was joy. The bells of the  churches rang a merry peal of welcome; the people thronged the  streets,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18134"],[0,"Sixteen Months in Four German Prisons: Wesel, Sennelager, Klingelputz, Ruhleben (#2)"],[1,"time  with this scion of the Russian nobility discussing the final  arrangements concerning my departure to his palace in Russia, where I  was to devote two months to a special matter in which he was deeply  interested, and which involved the use of special and elaborate  photographic apparatus, microscopes, optical lantern and other  accessories. I may mention that the mission in question was purely of  scientific import.    During the discussion of these final arrangements a telegram was handed  to the Prince. He scanned it hurriedly, jumped up from his seat, and  apologising for his abruptness, explained that he had been suddenly  called home. He expressed the hope that he would shortly see me in  Russia, where I was promised a fine time, but that he would instruct me  the precise date when to start. Meanwhile I was urged to complete my  purchases of the paraphernalia which we had decided to be imperative for  our purpose, and he handed me sufficient funds to settle all the  accounts in connection therewith. That night the Prince bade me farewell  and hurried off to catch the boat train. My next communication from him  was the brief instruction urging me to start on August 1.[1]        [Footnote 1: I have never heard since from the Prince. A day or      two after the outbreak of war, upon joining the Russian forces,      he, with an observer, ascended in an aeroplane--he was an      enthusiastic and skilled aviator--to conduct a reconnaissance      over the German lines. He was never seen nor heard of again.      Searching enquiries have been made without result, and now it is      presumed that he was lost or killed.--H.C.M.]    Shortly after his departure there were ominous political rumblings, but  I, in common with the great majority, concluded that the storm would  blow over as it had done many times before. Moreover, I was so  pre-occupied with my coming task as to pay scanty attention to the  political barometer. I completed the purchase of the apparatuses, packed  them securely, and arranged for their dispatch to meet me at the train.  Then I remained at home to await developments. I was ready to start at a  moment's notice, having secured my passport, on which I was described,  for want of a better term, as a \"Tutor of Photography,\" and it was duly  vised by the Russian Embassy.    Although the political sky grew more and more ominous I paid but little  attention to the black clouds. The receipt of instructions to start at  once galvanised me into activity to the exclusion of all other thoughts.  I booked my passage right through to destination--Warsaw--and upon  making enquiries on July 31st was assured that I should get through all  right.    I left Brighton by the 5.10 train on Saturday afternoon, August 1st.  There was one incident at the station which, although it appeared to be  trivial, proved subsequently of far reaching significance. In addition  to many cameras of different types and sizes stowed in my baggage I  carried three small instruments in my pockets, one being particularly  small. I had always regarded this instrument with a strange affection  because, though exceedingly small and slipping into a tiny space, it was  capable of excellent work. As the train was moving from the station I  took two parting snapshots of my wife and family waving me farewell. It  was an insignificant incident over which I merely smiled at the time,  but five days later I had every cause to bless those parting snaps. One  often hears about life hanging by the proverbial thread, but not many  lives have hung upon two snapshot photographs of all that is dearest to  one, and a few inches of photographic film. Yet it was so in my case.  But for those two tiny parting pictures and the unexposed fraction of  film I should have been propped against the wall of a German prison to  serve as a target for Prussian rifles!    Upon reaching Victoria I found the evening boat-train being awaited by a  large crowd of enthusiastic and war-fever stricken Germans anxious to  get back to their homeland. The fiat had gone forth that all Germans of  military age were to return at once and they had rolled up _en masse_,  many accompanied by their wives, while there was a fair sprinkling of  Russian ladies also bent upon hurrying home. An hour before the train  was due the platform was packed with a dense chattering, gesticulating,  singing, and dancing crowd. Many pictures have been painted of the  British exodus from Berlin upon the eve of war but few, if any, have  ever been drawn of the wild stampede from Britain to Berlin which it was  my lot to experience.    As the train backed into the station there was a wild rush for seats.  The excited Teutons grabbed at handles--in fact at anything protruding  from the carriages--in a desperate endeavour to be first on the  footboard. Many were carried struggling and kicking along the platform.  Women were bowled over pell-mell and their shrieks and cries mingled  with the hoarse, exuberant howls of the war-fever stricken maniacs  already tasting the smell of powder and blood.    More by luck than judgment I obtained admission to a saloon carriage to  find myself the only Englishman among a hysterical crowd of forty  Germans. They danced, whistled, sang and joked as if bound on a  wayzegoose. Badinage was exchanged freely with friends standing on the  platform. Anticipating that things would probably grow lively during the  journey, I preserved a discreet silence, and my presence was ignored.    The whistle blew, the locomotive screeched, and the next moment we were  gliding out of the station to the accompaniment of wild cheering, good  wishes for a safe journey and speedy return, and the strains of music  which presently swelled into a roar about \"Wacht am Rhein.\" The melody  was yelled out with such gusto and so repeatedly that I hoped I might  ever be spared from hearing its strains again. But at last Nature  asserted herself. The throats of the singers grew hoarse and tired, the  song came to a welcome end, and music gave way to vigorous and keen  discussion upon the trend of events, which was maintained, not only  during the train journey, but throughout the cross-Channel passage to  Flushing, which we reached at six o'clock the following morning.    At the Dutch port the wild excitement and hubbub broke out with  increased virulence. The report was circulated that the train now  awaiting us would be the last through express to Berlin. There was a  frantic rush for seats. Men, women, and children participated in the  wild melee. The brutal shouts of the men contrasted vividly with the  high-pitched adjurations of the women and the wails and cries of the  terrified children. Within a few minutes the train was packed to  suffocation, not an inch of standing-room being left, while the  corridors were barricaded with the overflow of baggage from the guards'  vans.    For two hours we stood there scarcely able to breathe. The heat of the  waxing summer's day began to assert itself, with the result that it was  not long before the women commenced to show signs of distress. Their  spirits revived, however, as the train commenced to move. There was one  solace--one and all were advancing towards home and the discomfort would  not last for long.    So keen was the desire to get to Berlin that the great majority of the  passengers had neglected to provide themselves with any food, lest they  should lose their seats or miss the train. But they confidently expected  that the train would pull up at some station to enable refreshments to  be obtained. They were supported in this belief by the withdrawal of the  usual dining car from the train. Those who trusted in luck, however,  were rudely disappointed. The train refused to stop at any station.  Instead, it evinced a decided preference for intermediate signal posts.  It was described as an express, but a tortoise's crawl would be a gallop  in comparison. It travelled at only a little more than a walking pace  and the stops were maddeningly frequent.    The women and children speedily betrayed painful evidences of the  suffering they were experiencing, which became accentuated as we  advanced. The close confinement rendered the atmosphere within the  carriages extremely oppressive. The weaker men and the women commenced  to faint but no assistance could be extended to them. One could move  barely an arm or leg. The afflicted passengers simply went off where  they were, sitting or standing, as the case might be, and prevented from  falling by the closely packed passengers around them, to come round as  best they could when Nature felt so disposed. The wails of the children  were pitiful. Many were crying from cramp and hunger, but nothing could  be done to satisfy them, and indeed the men took little notice of them.    The arrival--in time--at the frontier station at Goch somewhat revived  the distressed and drooping. Everyone seized the opportunity to stretch  the limbs, to inhale some fresh air, and to obtain some slight  refreshment. The Customs officials were unusually alert, harrying, and  inflexible. There was the eternal wrangling between the passengers and  the officials over articles liable to duty and it was somewhat amusing  to me, even with war beating the air, to follow the frantic and useless  efforts of old and experienced travellers to smuggle this, that, or  something else through the fiscal barrier.    The Customs were so far from being in a conciliatory mood as to be  absolutely deaf to entreaty, cajolery, argument, explanation or threat.  They cut the operations summarily short by confiscating everything  liable to duty. As may be imagined a rich harvest was garnered at the  expense of the luckless returning patriot. While the Customs were busy  the military officials, who appeared to be swarming everywhere, were  equally exacting. They boarded the train and literally turned it inside  out. Every man and"]]]
