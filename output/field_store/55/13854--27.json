Does it  suggest anything to your mind?  I must confess that it affords me no  assistance.\"    \"Nothing,\" I replied.  \"It is most curious.\"    \"Excuse me, Mr. Burboyne,\" said Smith, now turning to the secretary,  \"but Inspector Weymouth will tell you that I act with authority.  I  understand that Sir Crichton was--seized with illness in his study?\"    \"Yes--at half-past ten.  I was working here in the library, and he  inside, as was our custom.\"    \"The communicating door was kept closed?\"    \"Yes, always.  It was open for a minute or less about ten-twenty-five,  when a message came for Sir Crichton.  I took it in to him, and he then  seemed in his usual health.\"    \"What was the message?\"    \"I could not say.  It was brought by a district messenger, and he  placed it beside him on the table.  It is there now, no doubt.\"    \"And at half-past ten?\"    \"Sir Crichton suddenly burst open the door and threw himself, with a  scream, into the library.  I ran to him but he waved me back.  His eyes  were glaring horribly.  I had just reached his side when he fell,  writhing, upon the floor.  He seemed past speech, but as I raised him  and laid him upon the couch, he gasped something that sounded like 'The  red hand!' Before I could get to bell or telephone he was dead!\"    Mr. Burboyne's voice shook as he spoke the words, and Smith seemed to  find this evidence confusing.    \"You do not think he referred to the mark on his own hand?\"    \"I think not.  From the direction of his last glance, I feel sure he  referred to something in the study.\"    \"What did you do?\"    \"Having summoned the servants, I ran into the study. But there was  absolutely nothing unusual to be seen.  The windows were closed and  fastened.  He worked with closed windows in the hottest weather.  There  is no other door, for the study occupies the end of a narrow wing, so  that no one could possibly have gained access to it, whilst I was in  the library, unseen by me.  Had someone concealed himself in the study  earlier in the evening--and I am convinced that it offers no  hiding-place--he could only have come out again by passing through  here.\"    Nayland Smith tugged at the lobe of his left ear, as was his habit when  meditating.    \"You had been at work here in this way for some time?\"    \"Yes.  Sir Crichton was preparing an important book.\"    \"Had anything unusual occurred prior to this evening?\"    \"Yes,\" said Mr. Burboyne, with evident perplexity; \"though I attached  no importance to it at the time.  Three nights ago Sir Crichton came  out to me, and appeared very nervous; but at times his nerves--you  know?  Well, on this occasion he asked me to search the study.  He had  an idea that something was concealed there.\"    \"Some THING or someone?\"    \"'Something' was the word he used.  I searched, but fruitlessly, and he  seemed quite satisfied, and returned to his work.\"    \"Thank you, Mr. Burboyne.  My friend and I would like a few minutes'  private investigation in the study.\"        CHAPTER II      SIR CRICHTON DAVEY'S study was a small one, and a glance sufficed to  show that, as the secretary had said, it offered no hiding-place. It  was heavily carpeted, and over-full of Burmese and Chinese ornaments  and curios, and upon the mantelpiece stood several framed photographs  which showed this to be the sanctum of a wealthy bachelor who was no  misogynist.  A map of the Indian Empire occupied the larger part of one  wall.  The grate was empty, for the weather was extremely warm, and a  green-shaded lamp on the littered writing-table afforded the only  light.  The air was stale, for both windows were closed and fastened.    Smith immediately pounced upon a large, square envelope that lay beside  the blotting-pad. Sir Crichton had not even troubled to open it, but my  friend did so.  It contained a blank sheet of paper!    \"Smell!\" he directed, handing the letter to me.  I raised it to my  nostrils.  It was scented with some pungent perfume.    \"What is it?\"  I asked.    \"It is a rather rare essential oil,\" was the reply, \"which I have met  with before, though never in Europe.  I begin to understand, Petrie.\"    He tilted the lamp-shade and made a close examination of the scraps of  paper, matches, and other debris that lay in the grate and on the  hearth.  I took up a copper vase from the mantelpiece, and was  examining it curiously, when he turned, a strange expression upon his  face.    \"Put that back, old man,\" he said quietly.    Much surprised, I did as he directed.    \"Don't touch anything in the room.  It may be dangerous.\"    Something in the tone of his voice chilled me, and I hastily replaced  the vase, and stood by the door of the study, watching him search,  methodically, every inch of the room--behind the books, in all the  ornaments, in table drawers, in cupboards, on shelves.    \"That will do,\" he said at last.  \"There is nothing here and I have no  time to search farther.\"    We returned to the library.    \"Inspector Weymouth,\" said my friend, \"I have a particular reason for  asking that Sir Crichton's body be removed from this room at once and  the library locked.  Let no one be admitted on any pretense whatever  until you hear from me.\" It spoke volumes for the mysterious  credentials borne by my friend that the man from Scotland Yard accepted  his orders without demur, and, after a brief chat with Mr. Burboyne,  Smith passed briskly downstairs.  In the hall a man who looked like a  groom out of livery was waiting.    \"Are you Wills?\" asked Smith.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"It was you who heard a cry of some kind at the rear of the house about  the time of Sir Crichton's death?\"    \"Yes, sir.  I was locking the garage door, and, happening to look up at  the window of Sir Crichton's study, I saw him jump out of his chair.  Where he used to sit at his writing, sir, you could see his shadow on  the blind.  Next minute I heard a call out in the lane.\"    \"What kind of call?\"    The man, whom the uncanny happening clearly had frightened, seemed  puzzled for a suitable description.    \"A sort of wail, sir,\" he said at last.  \"I never heard anything like  it before, and don't want to again.\"    \"Like this?\" inquired Smith, and he uttered a low, wailing cry,  impossible to describe.  Wills perceptibly shuddered; and, indeed, it  was an eerie sound.    \"The same, sir, I think,\" he said, \"but much louder.\"    \"That will do,\" said Smith, and I thought I detected a note of triumph  in his voice.  \"But stay!  Take us through to the back of the house.\"    The man bowed and led the way, so that shortly we found ourselves in a  small, paved courtyard.  It was a perfect summer's night, and the deep  blue vault above was jeweled with myriads of starry points.  How  impossible it seemed to reconcile that vast, eternal calm with the  hideous passions and fiendish agencies which that night had loosed a  soul upon the infinite.    \"Up yonder are the study windows, sir.  Over that wall on your left is  the back lane from which the cry came, and beyond is Regent's Park.\"    \"Are the study windows visible from there?\"    \"Oh, yes, sir.\"    \"Who occupies the adjoining house?\"    \"Major-General Platt-Houston, sir; but the family is out of town.\"    \"Those iron stairs are a means of communication between the domestic  offices and the servants' quarters, I take it?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then send someone to make my business known to the Major-General's  housekeeper; I want to examine those stairs.\"    Singular though my friend's proceedings appeared to me, I had ceased to  wonder at anything.  Since Nayland Smith's arrival at my rooms I seemed  to have been moving through the fitful phases of a nightmare.  My  friend's account of how he came by the wound in his arm; the scene on  our arrival at the house of Sir Crichton Davey; the secretary's story  of the dying man's cry, \"The red hand!\"; the hidden perils of the  study; the wail in the lane--all were fitter incidents of delirium than  of sane reality.  So, when a white-faced butler made us known to a  nervous old lady who proved to be the housekeeper of the next-door  residence, I was not surprised at Smith's saying:    \"Lounge up and down outside, Petrie.  Everyone has cleared off now.  It  is getting late.  Keep your eyes open and be on your guard.  I thought  I had the start, but he is here before me, and, what is worse, he  probably knows by now that I am here, too.\"    With which he entered the house and left me out in the square, with  leisure to think, to try to understand.    The crowd which usually haunts the scene of a sensational crime had  been cleared away, and it had been circulated that Sir Crichton had  died from natural causes.  The intense heat having driven most of the  residents out of town, practically I had the square to myself, and I  gave myself up to a brief consideration of the mystery in which I so  suddenly had found myself involved.    By what agency had Sir Crichton met his death?  Did Nayland Smith know?  I rather suspected that he did.  What was the hidden significance of  the perfumed envelope?  Who was that mysterious personage whom Smith so  evidently dreaded, who had attempted his life, who, presumably, had  murdered Sir Crichton?  Sir Crichton Davey, during the time that he had  held office in India, and during his long term of service at home, had  earned the good will of all, British and native alike.  Who was his  secret enemy?    Something touched me lightly on the shoulder.    I turned, with my heart fluttering like a child's. This night's work  had imposed a severe strain even upon my callous nerves.    A girl wrapped in a hooded opera-cloak stood at my elbow, and, as she  glanced up at me, I thought that I never had seen a face so seductively  lovely nor of so unusual a type.  With the skin of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17306"],[0,"The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844 (#2)"],[1,"and  children in factories; we find the truck-system in full blossom, and the  cottage-system, in rural districts, made use of by the \"bosses\" as a  means of domination over the workers.  When I received, in 1886, the  American papers with accounts of the great strike of 12,000 Pennsylvanian  coal-miners in the Connellsville district, I seemed but to read my own  description of the North of England colliers' strike of 1844.  The same  cheating of the workpeople by false measure; the same truck-system; the  same attempt to break the miners' resistance by the capitalists' last,  but crushing, resource,--the eviction of the men out of their dwellings,  the cottages owned by the companies.    I have not attempted, in this translation, to bring the book up to date,  or to point out in detail all the changes that have taken place since  1844.  And for two reasons: Firstly, to do this properly, the size of the  book must be about doubled; and, secondly, the first volume of \"Das  Kapital,\" by Karl Marx, an English translation of which is before the  public, contains a very ample description of the state of the British  working-class, as it was about 1865, that is to say, at the time when  British industrial prosperity reached its culminating point.  I should,  then, have been obliged again to go over the ground already covered by  Marx's celebrated work.    It will be hardly necessary to point out that the general theoretical  standpoint of this book--philosophical, economical, political--does not  exactly coincide with my standpoint of to-day.  Modern international  Socialism, since fully developed as a science, chiefly and almost  exclusively through the efforts of Marx, did not as yet exist in 1844.  My  book represents one of the phases of its embryonic development; and as  the human embryo, in its early stages, still reproduces the gill-arches  of our fish-ancestors, so this book exhibits everywhere the traces of the  descent of modern Socialism from one of its ancestors,--German  philosophy.  Thus great stress is laid on the dictum that Communism is  not a mere party doctrine of the working-class, but a theory compassing  the emancipation of society at large, including the capitalist class,  from its present narrow conditions.  This is true enough in the abstract,  but absolutely useless, and sometimes worse, in practice.  So long as the  wealthy classes not only do not feel the want of any emancipation, but  strenuously oppose the self-emancipation of the working-class, so long  the social revolution will have to be prepared and fought out by the  working-class alone.  The French bourgeois of 1789, too, declared the  emancipation of the bourgeoisie to be the emancipation of the whole human  race; but the nobility and clergy would not see it; the  proposition--though for the time being, with respect to feudalism, an  abstract historical truth--soon became a mere sentimentalism, and  disappeared from view altogether in the fire of the revolutionary  struggle.  And to-day, the very people who, from the \"impartiality\" of  their superior standpoint, preach to the workers a Socialism soaring high  above their class interests and class struggles, and tending to reconcile  in a higher humanity the interests of both the contending classes--these  people are either neophytes, who have still to learn a great deal, or  they are the worst enemies of the workers,--wolves in sheeps' clothing.    The recurring period of the great industrial crisis is stated in the text  as five years.  This was the period apparently indicated by the course of  events from 1825 to 1842.  But the industrial history from 1842 to 1868  has shown that the real period is one of ten years; that the intermediate  revulsions were secondary, and tended more and more to disappear.  Since  1868 the state of things has changed again, of which more anon.    I have taken care not to strike out of the text the many prophecies,  amongst others that of an imminent social revolution in England, which my  youthful ardour induced me to venture upon.  The wonder is, not that a  good many of them proved wrong, but that so many of them have proved  right, and that the critical state of English trade, to be brought on by  Continental and especially American competition, which I then  foresaw--though in too short a period--has now actually come to pass.  In  this respect I can, and am bound to, bring the book up to date, by  placing here an article which I published in the _London Commonweal_ of  March 1, 1885, under the heading: \"England in 1845 and in 1885.\"  It  gives at the same time a short outline of the history of the English  working-class during these forty years, and is as follows:       \"Forty years ago England stood face to face with a crisis, solvable to     all appearances by force only.  The immense and rapid development of     manufactures had outstripped the extension of foreign markets and the     increase of demand.  Every ten years the march of industry was     violently interrupted by a general commercial crash, followed, after a     long period of chronic depression, by a few short years of prosperity,     and always ending in feverish over-production and consequent renewed     collapse.  The capitalist class clamoured for Free Trade in corn, and     threatened to enforce it by sending the starving population of the     towns back to the country districts whence they came, to invade them,     as John Bright said, not as paupers begging for bread, but as an army     quartered upon the enemy.  The working masses of the towns demanded     their share of political power--the People's Charter; they were     supported by the majority of the small trading class, and the only     difference between the two was whether the Charter should be carried     by physical or by moral force.  Then came the commercial crash of 1847     and the Irish famine, and with both the prospect of revolution       \"The French Revolution of 1848 saved the English middle-class.  The     Socialistic pronunciamentos of the victorious French workmen     frightened the small middle-class of England and disorganised the     narrower, but more matter-of-fact movement of the English     working-class.  At the very moment when Chartism was bound to assert     itself in its full strength, it collapsed internally, before even it     collapsed externally on the 10th of April, 1848.  The action of the     working-class was thrust into the background.  The capitalist class     triumphed along the whole line.       \"The Reform Bill of 1831 had been the victory of the whole capitalist     class over the landed aristocracy.  The repeal of the Corn Laws was     the victory of the manufacturing capitalist not only over the landed     aristocracy, but over those sections of capitalists, too, whose     interests were more or less bound up with the landed     interest,--bankers, stock-jobbers, fund-holders, etc.  Free Trade     meant the re-adjustment of the whole home and foreign, commercial and     financial policy of England in accordance with the interests of the     manufacturing capitalists--the class which now represented the nation.     And they set about this task with a will.  Every obstacle to     industrial production was mercilessly removed.  The tariff and the     whole system of taxation were revolutionised.  Everything was made     subordinate to one end, but that end of the utmost importance to the     manufacturing capitalist: the cheapening of all raw produce, and     especially of the means of living of the working-class; the reduction     of the cost of raw material, and the keeping down--if not as yet the     _bringing down_--of wages.  England was to become the 'workshop of the     world;' all other countries were to become for England what Ireland     already was,--markets for her manufactured goods, supplying her in     return with raw materials and food.  England the great manufacturing     centre of an agricultural world, with an ever-increasing number of     corn and cotton-growing Irelands revolving around her, the industrial     sun.  What a glorious prospect!       \"The manufacturing capitalists set about the realisation of this their     great object with that strong common sense and that contempt for     traditional principles which has ever distinguished them from their     more narrow-minded compeers on the Continent.  Chartism was dying out.     The revival of commercial prosperity, natural after the revulsion of     1847 had spent itself, was put down altogether to the credit of Free     Trade.  Both these circumstances had turned the English working-class,     politically, into the tail of the 'great Liberal party,' the party led     by the manufacturers.  This advantage, once gained, had to be     perpetuated.  And the manufacturing capitalists, from the Chartist     opposition, not to Free Trade, but to the transformation of Free Trade     into the one vital national question, had learnt, and were learning     more and more, that the middle-class can never obtain full social and     political power over the nation except by the help of the     working-class.  Thus a gradual change came over the relations between     both classes.  The Factory Acts, once the bugbear of all     manufacturers, were not only willingly submitted to, but their     expansion into acts regulating almost all trades, was tolerated.     Trades' Unions, hitherto considered inventions of the devil himself,     were now petted and patronised as perfectly legitimate institutions,     and as useful means of spreading sound economical doctrines amongst     the workers.  Even strikes, than which nothing had been more nefarious     up to 1848, were now gradually found out to be occasionally very     useful, especially when provoked by the masters themselves, at their     own time.
