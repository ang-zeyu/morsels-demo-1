The books were very different one from another, sometimes  they were mutually hostile; yet we found in all some quality which made  them one, and made us at one with them. We will not attempt to analyze  that quality. It was, perhaps, in part, that deep Russian tenderness,  which never derides but only pities and respects the unfortunate; in  part that simple Russian sincerity which never fears to see the truth  and to express it; but most of all it was that ever-present sense of  spiritual values, behind the material and utterly transcending the  material, which enables Russian literature to move so naturally in a  world of the spirit, where there are no barriers between the ages and  the nations, but all mankind is one.    And they call you \"barbarians\"! The fact should make us ask again what  we mean by the words \"culture\" and \"civilization.\" Critics used once to  call our Shakespeare a barbarian, and might equally well give the same  name to Aeschylus or Isaiah. All poets and prophets are in this sense  barbarians, that they will not measure life by the standards of external  \"culture.\" And it is at a time like this, when the material civilization  of Europe seems to have betrayed us and shown the lie at its heart, that  we realize that the poets and prophets are right, and that we must, like  them and like your great writers, once more see life with the simplicity  of the barbarian or the child, if we are to regain our peace and freedom  and build up a better civilization on the ruins of this that is  crumbling.    That task, we trust, will some day lie before us. When at last our  victorious fleets and armies meet together, and the allied nations of  East and West set themselves to restore the well-being of many millions  of ruined homes, France and Great Britain will assuredly bring their  large contributions of good-will and wisdom, but your country will have  something to contribute which is all its own. It is not only because of  your valor in war and your achievements in art, science, and letters  that we rejoice to have you for allies and friends; it is for some  quality in Russia herself, something both profound and humane, of which  these achievements are the outcome and the expression.    You, like us, entered upon this war to defend a weak and threatened  nation, which trusted you, against the lawless aggression of a strong  military power; you, like us, have continued it as a war of self-defense  and self-emancipation. When the end comes and we can breathe again, we  will help one another to remember the spirit in which our allied nations  took up arms, and thus work together in a changed Europe to protect the  weak, to liberate the oppressed, and to bring eventual healing to the  wounds inflicted on suffering mankind both by ourselves and our enemies.    With assurances of our friendship and gratitude, we sign ourselves,    WILLIAM ARCHER,      J.W. MACKAIL,  MAURICE BARING,      JOHN MASEFIELD,  J.M. BARRIE,         A.E.W.

ANTHONY HOPE,  HENRY JAMES,          Russia and Europe's War    By Paul Vinogradoff.           _The following letter to The London Times by Paul Vinogradoff,       Corpus Professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford University,       appeared on Sept. 14, 1914. Prof. Vinogradoff was invited to       return to Russia a few years ago to become a Minister of       State, but on going there he found the Ministry not liberal       enough for him, and returned to Oxford._    _To the Editor of The Times:_    SIR: I hope you may see your way to publish the following somewhat  lengthy statement on one of the burning questions of the day.    In this time of crisis, when the clash of ideas seems as fierce as the  struggle of the hosts, it is the duty of those who possess authentic  information on one or the other point in dispute to speak out firmly and  clearly. I should like to contribute some observations on German and  Russian conceptions in matters of culture. I base my claim to be heard  on the fact that I have had the privilege of being closely connected  with Russian, German, and English life. As a Russian Liberal, who had to  give up an honorable position at home for the sake of his opinions, I  can hardly be suspected of subserviency to the Russian bureaucracy.    I am struck by the insistence with which the Germans represent their  cause in this worldwide struggle as the cause of civilization as opposed  to Muscovite barbarism; and I am not sure that some of my English  friends do not feel reluctant to side with the subjects of the Czar  against the countrymen of Harnack and Eucken. One would like to know,  however, since when did the Germans take up this attitude? They were not  so squeamish during the \"war of emancipation,\" which gave birth to  modern Germany. At that time the people of Eastern Prussia were  anxiously waiting for the appearance of Cossacks as heralds of the  Russian hosts who were to emancipate them from the yoke of Napoleon. Did  the Prussians and Austrians reflect on the humiliation of an alliance  with the Muscovites, and on the superiority of the code civil when the  Russian Guard at Kulm stood like a rock against the desperate onslaughts  of Vandamme? Perhaps by this time the inhabitants of Berlin have  obliterated the bas-relief in the Alley of Victories, representing  Prince William of Prussia, the future victor of Sedan, seeking safety  within the square of the Kaluga regiment! Russian blood has flowed in  numberless battles in the cause of the Germans and Austrians. The  present Armageddon might perhaps have been avoided if Emperor Nicholas  I. had left the Hapsburg monarchy to its own resources in 1849, and had  not unwisely crushed the independence of Hungary. Within our memory, the  benevolent neutrality of Russia guarded Germany in 1870 from an attack  in the rear by its opponents of Sadowa. Are all such facts to be  explained away on the ground that the despised Muscovites may be  occasionally useful as \"gun meat,\" but are guilty of sacrilege if they  take up a stand against German taskmasters in \"shining armor\"? The older  generations of Germany had not yet reached that comfortable conclusion.  The last recommendation which the founder of the German Empire made on  his deathbed to his grandson was to keep on good terms with that Russia  which is now proclaimed to be a debased mixture of Byzantine, Tartar,  and Muscovite abominations.    Fortunately, the course of history does not depend on the frantic  exaggerations of partisans. The world is not a classroom in which docile  nations are distributed according to the arbitrary standards of German  pedagogues. Europe has admired the patriotic resistance of the Spanish,  Tyrolese, and Russian peasants to the enlightened tyranny of Napoleon.  There are other standards of culture besides proficiency in research and  aptitude for systematic work. The massacre of Louvain, the hideous  brutality of the Germans--as regards non-combatants--to mention only one  or two of the appalling occurrences of these last weeks--have thrown a  lurid light on the real character of twentieth-century German culture.  \"By their fruits ye shall know them,\" said our Lord, and the saying  which He aimed at the Scribes and Pharisees of His time is indeed  applicable to the proud votaries of German civilization today. Nobody  wishes to underestimate the services rendered by the German people to  the cause of European progress, but those who have known Germany during  the years following on the achievements of 1870 have watched with dismay  the growth of that arrogant conceit which the Greeks called ubris. The  cold-blooded barbarity advocated by Bernhardi, the cynical view taken of  international treaties and of the obligations of honor by the German  Chancellor--these things reveal a spirit which it would be difficult  indeed to describe as a sign of progress.    One of the effects of such a frame of mind is to strike the victim of it  with blindness. This symptom has been manifest in the stupendous  blunders of German diplomacy. The successors of Bismarck have alienated  their natural allies, such as Italy and Rumania, and have driven England  into this war against the evident intentions of English Radicals. But  the Germans have misconceived even more important things--they set out  on their adventure in the belief that England would be embarrassed by  civil war and unable to take any effective part in the fray; and they  had to learn something which all their writers had not taught them--that  there is a nation's spirit watching over England's safety and greatness,  a spirit at whose mighty call all party differences and racial strifes  fade into insignificance. In the same way they had reckoned on the  unpreparedness of Russia, in consequence of internal dissensions and  administrative weakness, without taking heed of the love of all Russians  for Russia, of their devotion to the long-suffering giant whose life is  throbbing in their veins. The Germans expected to encounter raw and  sluggish troops under intriguing time-servers and military Hamlets whose  \"native hue of resolution\" had been \"sicklied o'er with the pale cast of  thought.\" Instead of that they were confronted with soldiers of the same  type as those whom "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18884"],[0,"Ducks at a Distance: A Waterfowl Identification Guide (#2)"],[1,"depths. To escape danger,  they can travel great distances underwater, emerging only enough to show  their head before submerging again.    Their diets of fish, shellfish, mollusks, and aquatic plants make them  second choice, as a group, for sportsmen. Canvasbacks and redheads  fattened on eel grass or wild celery are notable exceptions.    Since their wings are smaller in proportion to the size and weight of  their bodies, they have a more rapid wingbeat than puddle ducks.          Canvasback      Length--22 in.  Weight--3 lbs.    Normally late to start south, canvasbacks migrate in lines and irregular  V's.    In feeding areas, compact flocks fly in indefinite formations. Their  wingbeat is rapid and noisy; their speed is the swiftest of all our  ducks.    Feeding behavior is highly variable. In some areas they feed at night  and spend the day rafted up in open waters; in other areas they feed  inshore mornings and evenings.    On the water, body size and head shape distinguish them from scaups and  redheads.    Drakes _croak_, _peep_, and _growl_; hens have a mallard-like _quack_.          Redheads      Length--20 in.  Weight--2-1/2 lbs.    Range coast to coast, with the largest numbers in the Central Flyway.  Migratory flocks travel in V's; move in irregular formations over  feeding areas. Often found associating with canvasback.    In the air, they give the impression of always being in a hurry.    Usually spend the day in large rafts in deep water; feed morning and  evening in shallower sections.    Drakes _purr_ and _meow_; hens have a loud _squak_, higher than a hen  mallard's.          Ringneck      Length--17 in.  Weight--2-1/2 lbs.    Similar in appearance to scaups, but more often found in fresh marshes  and wooded ponds. In flight, the dark wings are different from the  white-edged wings of scaup.    Faint brown ring on drake's neck never shows in the field; light bands  at tip and base of bill are conspicuous.    Fly as small flocks in open formation; often land without circling.  Drakes _purr_; hens are usually silent.          Scaup      Greater--Length--18-1/2 in.           Weight--2 lbs.    Lesser--Length--17 in.          Weight--1-7/8 lbs.    Except for the wing marks, greater and lesser scaup appear nearly  identical in the field.    The light band near the trailing edges of the wings runs almost to the  tip in the greater scaup, but only about half way in the lesser.    Greater scaup prefer large open water areas; lesser scaup often use  marshes and ponds.    Both species migrate late, sometimes just before freezeup.    Flock movements are rapid, often erratic, usually in compact groups.    Hens are silent; drake lesser scaup _purr_; drake greater scaup have a  discordant _scaup, scaup_.          Goldeneye      Common--Length--19 in.          Weight--2-1/4 lbs.    Barrow's--Length--19 in.            Weight--2-3/4 lbs.    These are active, strong-winged fliers moving singly or in small flocks,  often high in the air. Distinctive wing-whistling sound in flight has  earned the name of whistlers.    Goldeneyes generally move south late in the season; most of them winter  on coastal waters and the Great Lakes. Inland, they like rapids and fast  water.    Barrow's goldeneye, predominantly a Westerner, is less wary than the  common goldeneye.    Hens of both species are look-alikes.    Drakes have a piercing _speer-speer_--hens a low _quack_. Both are  usually quiet.          Bufflehead      Length--14-1/2 in.  Weight--1 lb.    Stragglers migrate south in mid-fall, but the largest numbers move just  ahead of freezeup. Most flocks in feeding areas are small--5 or 6 birds,  with more hens and immatures than adult drakes.    Very small size, bold black and white color pattern, and low, swift  flight are field marks. Unlike most divers, they can fly straight up  from a watery takeoff.    Largest concentrations are on both seacoasts and along the Gulf of  Mexico. Inland, they will remain as far north as open water permits.    Usually silent. Drakes _squeak_ and have a guttural note; hens _quack_  weakly.          Ruddy      Length--15-1/2 in.  Weight--1-1/3 lbs.    The ruddy duck often dives or swims away from danger rather than flying.  When flying, their small wings stroke so fast they resemble bumblebees.    They are early to mid-fall migrants.    Drakes often cock their tails upright at an angle, the only species to  habitually do so.    Both hens and drakes are silent in the fall.          Red-Breasted Merganser      Length--23 in.  Weight--21-1/2 lbs.    These birds winter most abundantly in coastal waters, including the Gulf  of Mexico, and to a lesser extent, the Great Lakes.    Their flight, strong and direct, is usually low over the water. They are  difficult to distinguish in flight from the common merganser.    Voice: Seldom heard.          Common Merganser      Length--25-1/2 in.  Weight--2-1/2 lbs.    This species is larger than the red-breasted merganser, and is one of  the largest of our ducks. It is one of the last to migrate south, and is  more common than the red-breasted merganser on inland waters.    Flocks move in \"follow the leader\" style, low over the water.    The only call seems to be a startled _croak_.          Hooded Merganser      Length--18 in.  Weight--1-1/2 lbs.    Often seen in pairs, or very small flocks. Short rapid wingstrokes  create an impression of great speed.    Winters in the inland waters of all coastal States; seldom goes to salt  water.    Voice: Seldom heard in fall.          Whistling Ducks      Length--18-19 in.  Weight--1-3/4 lbs.    The trailing legs and rounded wings of these slow flying ducks makes  them look bigger than they are.    Both species are primarily Mexican. In the U.S., the black-bellied is  found only in south Texas and Louisiana. The fulvous also occurs there  and in Florida with occasional stragglers further north along both  coasts and the Mississippi Valley. The fulvous is the more common of the  two species in the United States.    Sexes are alike. Both species have shrill whistling calls.          White-Winged Scoter      Length--21-1/2 in.  Weight--3-1/2 lbs.    The three scoters on these two pages are sea ducks, wintering on open  coastal waters. White-wings are among the heaviest and largest of all  ducks.          Surf Scoter      Length--19-1/2 in.  Weight--2 lbs.    Like all scoters, these birds move along our coasts in loose flocks,  stringing into irregular, wavy lines. Drakes can be distinguished from  other scoters by two white patches on their head and the bright color of  the bill.    Flight is strong, direct, usually close to the waves.          Black Scoter      Length--19-1/2 in.  Weight--2-1/2 lbs.    In flight, drakes appear all black except for the flash of the slight  gray underwing and the bright yellow swelling at the base of the upper  bill.    Scoters feed on mollusks, crabs, and some fish and very little  vegetation. They are locally known as \"coots.\"          Common Eider      Length--23-1/2 in.  Weight--5 lbs.    Thick-necked stocky birds, alternately flapping and sailing in flight;  flocks string out in a line, close to the water. Occurs in the United  States chiefly along New England coasts and occasionally south to New  Jersey.    Other eiders--king, spectacled and Stellar's--occur in Alaska and are  not pictured in this guide. King eiders occasionally are found in north  Atlantic coastal waters.          Oldsquaw      Length--20-1/2 in.  Weight--2 lbs.    A slim, brightly plumaged sea duck. Smaller than the scoters or eiders.    Flight is swift and low with constantly changing flock formations.  Ranges along both coasts and the Great Lakes.    One of the most vocal of ducks; drakes have a loud pleasant _caloo,  caloo_, constantly heard.          Harlequin      Length--17 in.  Weight--1-1/2 lbs.    Glossy slate-blue plumage enlivened by white stripes and spots give the  adult male harlequin a striking appearance. The female resembles a small  female scoter. At a distance, both sexes look black. Flight is swift,  with abrupt turns. Flocks are small and compact. Ranges both coasts,  north from New Jersey and San Francisco. Uncommon.          Swans      Trumpeter--Length--59 in.             Weight--28 lbs.    Whistling--Length--52 in.             Weight--16 lbs.    Once thought to be rare, trumpeter swans are slowly increasing in Alaska  and on western refuges and parks.    Whistling swans are common and increasing. They winter near Chesapeake  Bay, San Francisco Bay, Puget Sound and Salton Sea. Occasionally found  in fields.    Both species are large with pure white plumage.          Canada Geese      Numerous and popular, Canada geese are often called \"honkers.\" Includes  several races varying in weight from 3 to over 12 pounds. All have black  heads and necks, white cheeks, similar habitats and voices. Sexes are  identical.          Brant      Length--24-25 in.  Weight--3-1/4 - 3-3/4 lbs.    These are sea geese, the blacks wintering south to Baja, California, in  the Pacific. The Atlantic race winters from Virginia northward. Flight  is swift, in irregular and changing flock patterns.          Snow Geese      Length--29-31 in.  Weight--6-1/2 - 7-1/2 lbs.    Two races of snow geese are recognized: greater snows along the Atlantic  Coast, and lesser snows elsewhere on the continent. Blue geese are a  color phase of the lesser snow.          White-Fronted Geese      Length--29 in.  Weight--6-1/4 lbs.    Migrates chiefly in the Central and Pacific flyways but also present in  the Mississippi. Rare in the Atlantic Flyway. Appears brownish gray at a  distance. Often called \"specklebelly\".    Most distinctive characteristic of the V-shaped flocks is the high  pitched call _kow-kow-kow-kow_.
