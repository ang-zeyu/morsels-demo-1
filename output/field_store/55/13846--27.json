During  the early nineteenth century, Great Britain, in spite of the loss of the  thirteen colonies, was by far the most successful colonizing country,  and her possessions were to be found in Canada, India, the East and West  Indies, Australia, and Africa.    Leaders of other nations in Europe thought these colonies of Great  Britain were the cause of her wealth and prosperity. Naturally they too  tried to found colonies in those parts of the world not occupied by  Europeans. They hoped by this means to extend their power, to find homes  for their surplus population, and to obtain markets for their new  manufactured goods. Thus Africa was parceled out among France, Germany,  Great Britain, Portugal, Belgium, Spain, and Italy. The islands of the  Pacific were seized in the same manner. Proposals for a partition of  China were made by Germany, Russia, Japan, France, and Great Britain;  and if it had not been for the American demands for the \"open door of  trade\" and for the \"territorial integrity\" of China, that nation  probably would have shared the fate of Africa. The noteworthy fact about  this rivalry for colonies is that almost the entire world, except China  and Japan, came under the domination of Europeans and their descendants.    Having noted a few general features of European history during the  nineteenth century, we shall now take up in turn each of the more  important countries.    GERMANY.--After the overthrow of Napoleon, a German Confederation was  formed. This comprised thirty-nine states which were bound to each other  by a very weak tie. The union was not so strong even as that in our own  country under the Articles of Confederation. But there were two states  in the German Confederation which were far stronger than any of the  others; these were Austria and Prussia. Austria had been a great power  in German and European affairs for centuries; but her rulers were now  incompetent and corrupt. Prussia, on the other hand, was an upstart,  whose strength lay in universal military service. As the century  progressed, the influence of Prussia became greater; and the jealousy of  Austria grew proportionately. Bismarck, the Prussian prime minister,  adopted a policy of \"blood and iron.\" By this he meant that Prussia  would attain the objects of her ambition by means of war. Under his  guidance she would intimidate or conquer the other German states and  force them into trade and commercial agreements, or annex their  territory to that of Prussia.    Bismarck looked for success only to the army. With the king back of him,  he defied the people's representatives, ignored the Prussian  constitution, and purposely picked quarrels with his neighbors. In 1866,  in a brief war of seven weeks, Austria was hopelessly defeated and  forced to retire from the German Confederation. In 1870, when he felt  sure of his military preparations, Bismarck altered a telegram and thus  brought on a war with France. The Franco-Prussian War lasted only a few  months; but in that time the French were thoroughly defeated. Many  important results followed the war: (1) The German states, influenced by  the patriotic excitement of a successful war, founded the German Empire,  with Prussia in the leading position, and the Prussian king as German  emperor or \"Kaiser.\" (2) A huge indemnity of one billion dollars was  exacted by Prussia from France, and this money, deposited in the German  banks and loaned to individuals, played a large part in expanding the  manufactures and commerce of Germany. (3) Prussia took away from France,  against the wishes of the inhabitants, the provinces called  Alsace-Lorraine. This \"wrong done to France,\" as President Wilson has  said, \"unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years.\" (4) The  French people carried through a revolution and established a  republic--for the third time in their history--which has continued down  to the present.    After 1870 Germany made remarkable material progress. By 1911 her  population had grown from 41,000,000 to 65,000,000. Her coal and iron  production in 1911 was eight times as much as in 1871. In wealth,  commerce, coal production, and textile industries, among European  countries, Germany was second only to Great Britain; while in the  production of iron and steel Germany had passed Great Britain and was  second only to the United States.    But this great industrial and commercial advance was not accompanied  with a corresponding liberality in government. The constitution of the  German Empire gave very large powers to the emperor, and very little  power to the representatives of the people. Prussia, the dominant state  in the empire, had an antiquated system of voting which rated men's  votes according to the taxes they paid, and placed political power in  the hands of a small number of capitalists and wealthy landowners,  especially the Junkers (yoong'kerz), or Prussian nobles. The educational  system, while giving a rudimentary education to all, was really designed  to keep large masses of the people subject to the military group, the  government officials, and the capitalists. Blind devotion to the emperor  and belief in the necessity of future war in order to increase German  prosperity, were widely taught. The \"mailed fist\" was clenched, and \"the  shining sword\" rattled in the scabbard whenever Germany thought the  other nations of Europe showed her a lack of respect. Enormous  preparations for war were made in order that Germany might gain from her  neighbors the \"place in the sun\" which she was determined upon. Other  nations were to be pushed aside or be broken to pieces in order that the  German \"super-men\" might enjoy all that they wished of this world's  goods and possessions.    AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.--The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in 1910 had a  population of 49,000,000, made up of peoples and races who spoke  different languages and had different customs, habits, and ideals. These  races, instead of being brought under unifying influences as foreigners  are in the United States, had for centuries retained their  peculiarities. Germans comprised 24 per cent of the total population;  Hungarians, 20 per cent; Slavic races (including Bohemians, Poles, South  Slavs, and others), 45 per cent; Roumanians, over 6 per cent; and  Italians less than 2 per cent. The Germans and Hungarians, although only  a minority of the total population, had long exercised political control  over the others and by repressive measures had tried to stamp out their  schools, newspapers, and languages. Unrest was continuous during the  nineteenth century; and the rise of the independent states of Serbia,  Roumania, and Bulgaria tended to make the Slavic and Roumanian  inhabitants of Austria-Hungary dissatisfied with their own position.    After 1815 the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy continued under the rule of the  royal family of Hapsburgs, whose proud history extends back to the  fifteenth century. Austria (but not Hungary) was part of the German  Confederation, and her representative had the right of presiding at all  meetings of the confederation. Between 1815 and 1848 the Austrian  emperor and his Prime minister were the leaders in opposition to popular  government and national aspirations. But in 1848 a serious uprising  took place, and it seemed for a time that the diverse peoples would fly  apart from each other and establish separate states. The emperor  abdicated and his prime minister fled to England. Francis Joseph, the  young heir to the throne, with the aid of experienced military leaders  succeeded in suppressing the rebellion. For sixty-eight years  (1848-1916) he was personally popular and held together the composite  state.    In 1866 Austria was driven out of the German Confederation by Prussia.  Seven years earlier she had lost most of her Italian possessions.  Thereafter her interests and ambitions lay to the southeast; and she  bent her energies to extend her territory, influence, and commerce into  the Balkan region. A semblance of popular government was established in  Austria and in Hungary, which were separated from each other in ordinary  affairs, but continued under the same monarch. In each country, however,  the suffrage and elections were so juggled that the ruling minority, of  Germans in Austria and of Hungarians in Hungary, was enabled to keep the  majority in subjection.    Austria-Hungary has not progressed as rapidly in industry and commerce  as the countries to the north and west of her. Her life is still largely  agricultural, and cultivation is often conducted by primitive methods.  Before the war her wealth per person was only $500, as compared with  $1843 in the United States, $1849 in Great Britain, $1250 in France, and  $1230 in Germany. She possessed only one good seaport, Trieste  (tr[)i]-[)e]st'), and this partly explained her desire to obtain access to  the Black Sea and the AEgean Sea. About half of her foreign trade was  carried on with Germany. The low standards of national wealth and  production made the raising of taxes a difficult matter. The government  had a serious struggle to obtain the funds for a large military and  naval program.    ITALY.--For a thousand years before 1870 there was no single  government for the entire Italian peninsula. Although the people were  mainly of one race, their territory was divided into small states ruled  by despotic princes, who were sometimes of Italian families, but more  often were foreigners--Greeks, Germans, French, Spanish, and Austrians.  The Pope, head of the Roman Catholic Church, governed nearly one third  of the land. This condition continued after 1815. But during the  nineteenth century the Italians began to realize that they belonged to  one race. They saw that the rule of foreigners was opposed to the  national welfare.    By 1870 the union of all Italy into one"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17212"],[0,"Michelangelo (#2)"],[1," still  read with interest and profit, though it is to be regretted that they  should be reprinted without any editorial comments to connect formerly  received opinions with later conclusions. John S. Harford's \"Life of  Michael Angelo Buonarotti\" was published at about the same time as  Grimm's work, that is, in 1857. It was in two volumes, and contained  translations of many of Michelangelo's poems, as well as material  about Savonarola, Vittoria Colonna, and Raphael. The work is found in  the older libraries, and is well worth studying, as the latter portion  is still valuable for all that refers to the architecture of St.  Peter's.    Signor Gotti's \"Vita,\" in 1875, was the first to profit to any  considerable degree by documentary researches. The conclusions of this  book are best known to the English-reading public through Charles  Heath Wilson's \"Life and Works of Michelangelo Buonarotti\" (1876 and  1881), consisting of compilations from Gotti, to which are added  original investigations of the Sistine frescoes, which are very  valuable.    More privileged than any of his predecessors was John Addington  Symonds, who, by special favor of the Italian government, was allowed  to examine the Buonarotti collection in Florence, so long debarred to  others. His \"Life of Michelangelo Buonarotti\" is therefore unique in  being, as the sub-title announces, \"based on studies in the archives  of the Buonarotti family at Florence.\" It was published in 1893 in two  large, finely illustrated volumes, and is taken as the latest  authoritative word on the subject, a word singularly independent of  others' conclusions, and influenced by an artistic and literary nature  of rare sensitiveness.    To those who wish briefer notices of Michelangelo's life and work than  any of these full biographies are recommended the chapters on  Michelangelo in Kugler's \"Handbook of the Italian Schools,\" in Mrs.  Jameson's \"Memoirs of the Italian Painters,\" in Frank Preston  Stearns's \"Midsummer of Italian Art,\" in Mrs. Oliphant's \"Makers of  Florence,\" and in Symonds's volume on \"Fine Arts\" in the series  \"Renaissance in Italy.\"    To understand more fully the character of the man Michelangelo, the  student should read his sonnets. There is a complete collection  translated by J.A. Symonds, while both Wordsworth and Longfellow have  translated a few.    The life of Michelangelo has furnished material for two long poems by  American writers,--Longfellow's drama, and the poem by Stuart Sterne.  The former, which is annotated, is a well-balanced study of the great  artist's career and ideals.          III. HISTORICAL DIRECTORY OF THE WORKS OF ART IN THIS COLLECTION.      _Portrait frontispiece._ An oil painting in The Hall of the Portraits  of Old Masters, Uffizi Gallery, Florence. The authorship of the  painting is not certainly known. Symonds says that \"it may perhaps be  ascribed with some show of probability to Bugiardini.\" Bugiardini was a  friend of Michelangelo's youth and a fellow student in the gardens of  the Medici. That later in life he painted a portrait of his  distinguished friend we know from Vasari. Vasari tells us that the  portrait showed a peculiarity in the right eye, and this fact lends  probability to the identification of the Uffizi portrait with  Bugiardini's work.    1. _Madonna and Child_, an unfinished bas-relief medallion, made,  according to Vasari, during Michelangelo's residence in Florence in  1501-1505. It was made for Bartolommeo Pitti. It is now in the  National Museum (Bargello), Florence.    2. _David_, a statue made from a block of Carrara marble which had  been spoiled by an unskilled sculptor. After it had lain useless in  Florence for a century, a sculptor applied to the board of works of  the cathedral for permission to use it. The board consulted  Michelangelo and offered him the marble. He undertook to cut from it a  single figure which would exactly use the block. The contract to make  the statue of David was drawn up in 1501, and the statue was completed  in 1504. Forty men were employed four days to remove it from the  cathedral works to the Piazza della Signoria, where it was placed on  the platform of the palace (Palazzo Vecchio), remaining in the open  air more than three centuries. The weather was beginning to injure it,  and it was removed in 1873 to the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence,  where it now stands.    3. _Cupid._ Symonds gives the following account of the statue in the  \"Life of Michelangelo,\" published in 1893: \"Discovered some forty  years ago, hidden away in the cellars of the Gualfonda (Ruccellai)  Gardens, Florence, by Professor Milanesi and the famous Florentine  sculptor, Santarelli. On a cursory examination they both declared it  to be a genuine Michelangelo. The left arm was broken, the right hand  damaged, and the hair had never received the sculptor's final touches.  Santarelli restored the arm, and the Cupid passed by purchase into the  possession of the English nation.\" It is now in the Museum of South  Kensington.    4. _Moses_, a statue on the tomb commemorative of Julius II.,[2] in  the church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, Rome. At the beginning of  Michelangelo's connection with Julius II., he made plans for a  magnificent monumental tomb for this pope, to be ornamented with more  than forty statues and to be of great size (34-1/2 x 23 feet). The  fickleness of the Pope caused a continual series of disappointments in  the progress of the work, which was finally abandoned for the frescoes  of the Sistine Chapel. After the death of the Pope, his executors were  even less zealous for the completion of the tomb. A succession of  contracts were made and broken, each one reducing the size and  importance of the design. The artist was continually in demand for  other work. Finally, in 1542, to leave him free for the services of  the Pope, the completion of the tomb was put into other hands. The  statue of Moses, with those of Rachel and Leah, is all that  Michelangelo contributed to a work which had occupied his thoughts for  nearly forty years. The setting of the Moses is in every way  exceedingly unfavorable to a proper appreciation of the work.    [Footnote 2: The Pope, Julius II., is buried at St. Peter's.]    5. _Holy Family_, an oil painting belonging to the Florentine period  1501-1505, and painted for Angelo Doni. It is now in the Uffizi  Gallery, Florence.    6. _The Pieta_, a marble group executed by the order of the Cardinal  di San Dionigi according to a contract drawn up August 28, 1498. It  was placed in the old basilica of St. Peter's (Rome), in a chapel  dedicated to Our Lady of the Fever (Madonna della Febbre). In the  present church of St. Peter's it occupies a side chapel, to which it  gives its name, where it is placed so high that it is impossible to  see it well, and where its beauty is disfigured by the bronze cherubs  fastened above, holding a crown over the Virgin's head.    7. _Christ Triumphant_, a marble statue ordered by Bernardo Cencio (a  canon of St. Peter's), Mario Scappuci, and Metello Varj dei Porcari  for the church of S. Maria sopra Minerva, Rome, where it still stands.  The deed was executed in 1514, specifying that the statue should be of  marble, \"life sized, naked, erect, with a cross in his arms.\" It  appears from Michelangelo's correspondence that the work was finished  by apprentices, first by Pietro Urbano, who did so badly that he was  discharged and replaced by Federigo Frizzi. It was completed in 1521,  when Michelangelo offered to make a new statue if it was not  satisfactory. Varj, however, declared that the sculptor had \"already  made what could not be surpassed and was incomparable,\" so the statue  was placed in position.    8-12. _The Creation of Man, Jeremiah, Daniel, The Delphic Sibyl, the  Cumaean Sibyl_, frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, Rome,  begun in 1508 at the order of the Pope Julius II. Michelangelo  undertook the work reluctantly, as sculpture was his chosen art. The  architect Bramante first made a scaffolding for the work, so clumsily  constructed that Michelangelo replaced it by one of his own invention.  Several Florentine painters were engaged as assistants, but, failing  to satisfy the painter, returned. Julius II. often visited the chapel  during the work, climbing to the scaffolding to see how it progressed.  Impatient to see it, he gave orders to have the ceiling uncovered when  but half finished. The first uncovering took place November 1, 1509.  The work was completed October, 1512.    13-14. _Lorenzo de' Medici_, _Tomb of Giuliano de' Medici_, marble  tombs first projected in 1520 or 1521, during the pontificate of Leo  X. (formerly Giovanni de' Medici). The order was renewed by Clement  VII., another Medici pope, in 1523. The work was carried on  intermittently a number of years during which occurred the revolution,  siege, and recapture of Florence. From 1530-1533 Michelangelo carried  them to the point of completion in which they are now seen: they were  never fully finished. The identity of the tombs was long a matter of  doubt. Though Vasari had called the helmeted figure Lorenzo and the  other Giuliano, there were critics, notably Grimm, who took the  opposite view. In 1875 the sarcophagus of the helmeted figure was  opened and evidence found proving it to be unquestionably the tomb of  Lorenzo, as Vasari had said. Both tombs remain as originally placed in  the new sacristy of the church of San Lorenzo, Florence.    15. _Central Figures of the Last Judgment_, a fresco painting on the  wall of the Sistine Chapel, executed by the order of the Pope Paul  III., who in 1535 appointed Michelangelo chief architect, sculptor,  and painter at the Vatican. The work occupied several years and was  completed in 1541.          IV. COLLATERAL READINGS FROM LITERATURE.    IN CONNECTION WITH THE SEVERAL WORKS HERE REPRESENTED.
