[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17855"],[0,"Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material (#2)"],[1,"l.    In Kentucky, hemp is grown in most of the counties within a radius of 50  miles of Lexington. No accurate statistics of the acreage are collected,  but the crop harvested in 1915 is estimated at 7,000 acres. A machine  brake will probably be used in Bourbon County and also in Clark County,  but most of the hemp in Kentucky will be broken on hand brakes.      =BALING FOR SHIPMENT.=    The hurds will have to be baled to facilitate handling in transportation  and to economize storage space at the paper mills. The bales will need  to be covered with burlap or some material to keep them from shaking  out. They may be baled in the same presses that are used for baling hemp  fiber, but care must be exercised to avoid breaking the press, for the  hurds are more resistant than hemp fiber. A bale of hemp 2 by 3 by 4  feet weighs about 500 pounds. A bale of hurds of the same size will  weigh about one-third less, or approximately six bales per ton.    Rough hemp fiber as it is shipped from the farm is not covered;  therefore, the covering material must be purchased especially for the  hurds. A piece of burlap about 36 by 48 inches placed on either side of  the bale will be sufficient, but these pieces, weighing about 3 pounds  each, cost about 40 cents a pair. Baling rope, in addition to jute  covering, will cost at least 5 cents per bale, making the total cost of  covering and ties $2.70 or more per ton. Possibly chip-board, costing  about $33 per ton, or not more than 5 cents for the two pieces for each  bale, may be used in place of burlap. Chip-board, burlap, and also rope  ties may all be used for paper stock. Burlap covers might be returned,  to be used repeatedly until worn out, but chip-board could not be used  more than once.      =COST OF BALING.=    If burlap covers are used the cost of baling, including covering, ties,  use of baling press, power, and labor will amount to at least 60 cents  per bale, or about $3.75 per ton. If chip-board can be used the cost may  be reduced to about $2 per ton. The cost of hauling and loading on the  cars will vary from $1 to $3 per ton, depending upon the distance and  the roads. The farmer must therefore receive from $4 to $6 per ton for  the hurds, baled, on board cars at his home station.      =SUMMARY.=    Hemp hurds are the woody inner portion of the hemp stalk, broken into  pieces in removing the fiber.    They are not used at present for any purpose that would compete with  their use for paper.    Hurds are available only from machine-broken hemp, for the cost of  collecting them from the hand brakes would be too great.    About 7,000 tons are now available in restricted localities in Ohio,  Indiana, Wisconsin, and California.    The quantity is likely to increase as the use of machine brakes  increases.    The hurds may be baled in hemp-fiber presses, with partial burlap covers  like those on cotton bales, or possibly chip-board covers.    It is estimated that the farmers may deliver the bales on board cars  profitably at $4 to $6 per ton.            THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER FROM HEMP HURDS.    By JASON L. MERRILL, _Paper-Plant Chemist, Paper-Plant Investigations_.      =INTRODUCTION.=    The purpose of this paper is to report upon preliminary tests which were  conducted to determine the paper-making value of hemp hurds, a crop  waste of the hemp-fiber industry.    The search for plant materials capable of being utilized in paper  manufacture is a comparatively recent but world-wide activity which has  for its object the husbanding of present sources of paper-stock supply  by the substitution of new materials for some of those which are rapidly  becoming less plentiful and more costly.    The abstract idea of utilizing that which is at present a waste can play  no important role in such activities, the successful commercial outcome  of which must be based on the three fundamental factors--market or  demand for product, satisfactory raw material, and cost.    Since hemp hurds are to be treated in this report as a raw material for  the manufacture of book and printing papers, the qualities, supply,  probable future, and cost of the material will be considered in  comparison with wood, with which it must compete. There seems to be  little doubt that the present wood supply can not withstand indefinitely  the demands placed upon it, and with increased scarcity economy in the  use of wood will become imperative. This effect is already apparent in  many wood-using industries, and although the paper industry consumes  only about 3 per cent of the total forest cut, it is probable that it  will be affected through this economy. Our forests are being cut three  times as fast as they grow, and as wood becomes more expensive proper  growing and reforesting will receive more attention. Thus, naturally, a  balance will be established between production and consumption, but as  this condition approaches its limiting values the price of wood may rise  to such levels that there will be a demand for other raw materials.    The use of waste paper in conjunction with chemical wood pulp has  increased to enormous proportions, and it is probable that the increase  will continue. Although it is a cheaper raw material than wood, it is  reasonable to suppose that as the wood supply decreases and the price of  wood pulp advances, the price of waste paper will advance somewhat  proportionately.    In view of these conditions it is advisable to investigate the  paper-making value of the more promising plant materials before a  critical situation arises. To be of substantial value the investigations  should include not only a determination of the quality and quantity of  pulp and paper which the material is capable of producing, but should  embrace a consideration of such relevant factors as agricultural  conditions, farm practice, assembling conditions, transportation, and  probable future supply.    Certain cultivated plants seem particularly promising, because in the  harvesting of the regular crop that portion which might be utilized for  paper manufacture necessarily is either wholly or partially assembled.  To this class of plants belong corn, broom corn, sorghum, sugar cane,  bagasse, flax, hemp, and the cereal straws.[1]    [Footnote 1: For descriptions of investigations of some of these crops,  see the list of publications at the end of this bulletin.]    It is generally conceded that the employment of different raw materials  would probably yield products of a somewhat different quality than those  now prevailing in the markets, but the qualities of papers and the  public demands are so diversified and numerous that this possible  objection should not be serious. Ten years ago sulphite manufacturers  would not accept consignments of spruce logs if they contained over 5  per cent of fir, while to-day many manufacturers tolerate 50 per cent.  Rope papers are found to contain not only jute, but when this raw  material is not plentiful, chemical pulp of various kinds. \"Linen paper\"  is often no more than a trade term. Not long ago printing papers were  made entirely from chemical wood pulp, but to-day if it is desired to  secure paper which is free from ground wood the specifications must so  stipulate. Writing papers, formerly made entirely from rags, now are  likely to contain either chemical or even ground-wood pulp unless the  specifications prohibit it. Without doubt, many paper manufacturers have  maintained certain papers up to a fixed standard for a long series of  years, but it is equally true that competition has lowered the standard  of a great many papers, some of which had acquired a distinctive  recognition. The employment of plant fibers will not necessarily lower  the present quality of papers, but if their employment does result in  products whose qualities are somewhat different from our so-called  standard papers it does not necessarily follow that such papers will not  find a ready market.      =FACTORS JUSTIFYING AN INVESTIGATION OF HEMP HURDS.=    Hemp hurds form a crop waste, in that they necessarily are produced in  the raising and preparation of hemp fiber, and their present use and  value are comparatively insignificant.    The assembling of the hurds may be effected with economy, since the area  in which hemp is handled with the use of machine brakes is restricted.  Although it must be stated that the present annual supply would not be  sufficient to justify the installation of a pulp mill nor would its  transportation to existing mills appear feasible, it is expected that  the available annual tonnage, especially in certain general sections,  will increase, due to the increased use of the machine brake. The  present tonnage per annum is approximately as follows: In the region of  Ohio and Indiana, 2,500 tons; in the Wisconsin section, 1,000 tons; in  the California region, 1,400 tons.    In years of adverse weather conditions there are often large areas of  hemp which are not harvested on account of its poor quality; there are  also large areas of cut hemp which become overretted, due to inclement  weather. It has been suggested by some of the hemp raisers that this  large amount of material might be utilized as a paper stock. In these  cases the cost of the whole material would probably be somewhat higher  than that of the hurds, because either all or part of the cost of  harvesting and the total cost of breaking would have to be borne by the  paper maker. Moreover, the quality of this material would be so very  irregular and the supply so uncertain that it probably would not appeal  to the paper manufacturer.    Without doubt, hemp will continue to be one of the staple agricultural  crops of the United States. The wholesale destruction of the supply by  fire, as frequently happens in the case of wood, is precluded by the  very nature of the hemp-raising industry. Since only one year's growth  can be harvested annually the supply is not endangered by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17860"],[0,"Stories from Hans Andersen (#2)"],[1,"big bird flew  past the window.    The next day was bright and frosty, and then came the thaw--and after  that the spring. The sun shone, green buds began to appear, the swallows  built their nests, and people began to open their windows. The little  children began to play in their garden on the roof again. The roses were  in splendid bloom that summer; the little girl had learnt a hymn, and  there was something in it about roses, and that made her think of her  own. She sang it to the little boy, and then he sang it with her--        'Where roses deck the flowery vale,      There, Infant Jesus, we thee hail!'    The children took each other by the hands, kissed the roses, and  rejoiced in God's bright sunshine, and spoke to it as if the Child Jesus  were there. What lovely summer days they were, and how delightful it was  to sit out under the fresh rose-trees, which seemed never tired of  blooming.    Kay and Gerda were looking at a picture book of birds and animals one  day--it had just struck five by the church clock--when Kay said, 'Oh,  something struck my heart, and I have got something in my eye!'    The little girl put her arms round his neck, he blinked his eye; there  was nothing to be seen.    'I believe it is gone,' he said; but it was not gone. It was one of  those very grains of glass from the mirror, the magic mirror. You  remember that horrid mirror, in which all good and great things  reflected in it became small and mean, while the bad things were  magnified, and every flaw became very apparent.    Poor Kay! a grain of it had gone straight to his heart, and would soon  turn it to a lump of ice. He did not feel it any more, but it was still  there.    'Why do you cry?' he asked; 'it makes you look ugly; there's nothing the  matter with me. How horrid!' he suddenly cried; 'there's a worm in that  rose, and that one is quite crooked; after all, they are nasty roses,  and so are the boxes they are growing in!' He kicked the box and broke  off two of the roses.    'What are you doing, Kay?' cried the little girl. When he saw her alarm,  he broke off another rose, and then ran in by his own window, and left  dear little Gerda alone.    When she next got out the picture book he said it was only fit for  babies in long clothes. When his grandmother told them stories he always  had a but--, and if he could manage it, he liked to get behind her  chair, put on her spectacles and imitate her. He did it very well and  people laughed at him. He was soon able to imitate every one in the  street; he could make fun of all their peculiarities and failings. 'He  will turn out a clever fellow,' said people. But it was all that bit of  glass in his heart, that bit of glass in his eye, and it made him tease  little Gerda who was so devoted to him. He played quite different games  now; he seemed to have grown older. One winter's day, when the snow was  falling fast, he brought in a big magnifying glass; he held out the tail  of his blue coat, and let the snow flakes fall upon it.    'Now look through the glass, Gerda!' he said; every snowflake was  magnified, and looked like a lovely flower, or a sharply pointed star.    'Do you see how cleverly they are made?' said Kay. 'Much more  interesting than looking at real flowers. And there is not a single flaw  in them; they are perfect, if only they would not melt.'    Shortly after, he appeared in his thick gloves, with his sledge on his  back. He shouted right into Gerda's ear, 'I have got leave to drive in  the big square where the other boys play!' and away he went.    In the big square the bolder boys used to tie their little sledges to  the farm carts and go a long way in this fashion. They had no end of fun  over it. Just in the middle of their games a big sledge came along; it  was painted white, and the occupant wore a white fur coat and cap. The  sledge drove twice round the square, and Kay quickly tied his sledge on  behind. Then off they went, faster, and faster, into the next street.  The driver turned round and nodded to Kay in the most friendly way, just  as if they knew each other. Every time Kay wanted to loose his sledge  the person nodded again, and Kay stayed where he was, and they drove  right out through the town gates. Then the snow began to fall so heavily  that the little boy could not see a hand before him as they rushed  along. He undid the cords and tried to get away from the big sledge, but  it was no use, his little sledge stuck fast, and on they rushed, faster  than the wind. He shouted aloud, but nobody heard him, and the sledge  tore on through the snow-drifts. Every now and then it gave a bound, as  if they were jumping over hedges and ditches. He was very frightened,  and he wanted to say his prayers, but he could only remember the  multiplication tables.    The snow-flakes grew bigger and bigger, till at last they looked like  big white chickens. All at once they sprang on one side, the big sledge  stopped and the person who drove got up, coat and cap smothered in snow.  It was a tall and upright lady all shining white, the Snow Queen  herself.    'We have come along at a good pace,' she said; 'but it's cold enough to  kill one; creep inside my bearskin coat.'    She took him into the sledge by her, wrapped him in her furs, and he  felt as if he were sinking into a snowdrift.    'Are you still cold?' she asked, and she kissed him on the forehead.  Ugh! it was colder than ice, it went to his very heart, which was  already more than half ice; he felt as if he were dying, but only for a  moment, and then it seemed to have done him good; he no longer felt the  cold.    'My sledge! don't forget my sledge!' He only remembered it now; it was  tied to one of the white chickens which flew along behind them. The Snow  Queen kissed Kay again, and then he forgot all about little Gerda,  Grandmother, and all the others at home.    'Now I mustn't kiss you any more,' she said, 'or I should kiss you to  death!'    Kay looked at her, she was so pretty; a cleverer, more beautiful face  could hardly be imagined. She did not seem to be made of ice now, as she  was outside the window when she waved her hand to him. In his eyes she  was quite perfect, and he was not a bit afraid of her; he told her that  he could do mental arithmetic, as far as fractions, and that he knew the  number of square miles and the number of inhabitants of the country. She  always smiled at him, and he then thought that he surely did not know  enough, and he looked up into the wide expanse of heaven, into which  they rose higher and higher as she flew with him on a dark cloud, while  the storm surged around them, the wind ringing in their ears like  well-known old songs.    They flew over woods and lakes, over oceans and islands; the cold wind  whistled down below them, the wolves howled, the black crows flew  screaming over the sparkling snow, but up above, the moon shone bright  and clear--and Kay looked at it all the long, long winter nights; in the  day he slept at the Snow Queen's feet.      STORY THREE    THE GARDEN OF THE WOMAN LEARNED IN MAGIC    [Illustration: _Then an old, old woman came out of the house; she was  leaning upon a big, hooked stick, and she wore a big sun hat, which was  covered with beautiful painted flowers._]    But how was little Gerda getting on all this long time since Kay left  her? Where could he be? Nobody knew, nobody could say anything about  him. All that the other boys knew was, that they had seen him tie his  little sledge to a splendid big one which drove away down the street and  out of the town gates. Nobody knew where he was, and many tears were  shed; little Gerda cried long and bitterly. At last, people said he was  dead; he must have fallen into the river which ran close by the town.  Oh, what long, dark, winter days those were!    At last the spring came and the sunshine.    'Kay is dead and gone,' said little Gerda.    'I don't believe it,' said the sunshine.    'He is dead and gone,' she said to the swallows.    'We don't believe it,' said the swallows; and at last little Gerda did  not believe it either.    'I will put on my new red shoes,' she said one morning; 'those Kay never  saw; and then I will go down to the river and ask it about him!'    It was very early in the morning; she kissed the old grandmother, who  was still asleep, put on the red shoes, and went quite alone, out by the  gate to the river.    'Is it true that you have taken my little playfellow? I will give you my  red shoes if you will bring him back to me again.'    She thought the little ripples nodded in such a curious way, so she took  off her red shoes, her most cherished possessions, and threw them both  into the river. They fell close by the shore, and were carried straight  back to her by the little wavelets; it seemed as if the river would not  accept her offering, as it had not taken little Kay.    She only thought she had not thrown them far enough; so she climbed into  a boat which lay among the rushes, then she went right out to the  further end of it, and threw the shoes into the water again. But the  boat was loose, and her movements started it off, and it floated away  from the shore: she felt it moving and tried to get out, but before she  reached the other end the boat was more than a yard from the shore, and  was floating away quite quickly.    Little Gerda was terribly frightened, and began to cry, but nobody heard  her except the sparrows, and they could not carry her ashore, but they  flew alongside twittering, as if to cheer her, 'We are here, we are  here.' The boat floated rapidly away with the current; little Gerda sat  quite still with only her stockings on; her little red shoes floated  behind, but they could not catch up the boat, which drifted away faster  and faster.    The banks on both sides were very pretty with beautiful flowers, fine  old trees, and slopes dotted with sheep and cattle, but not a single  person.    'Perhaps"]]]
