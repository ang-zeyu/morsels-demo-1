Gods they were not, but foul spirits of the air,  rulers of the darkness. Was there not glory and honour in fighting  with them, in daring their anger under the shield of faith, in  putting them to flight with the sword of truth? What better  adventure could a brave man ask than to go forth against them, and  wrestle with them, and conquer them?    \"Look you, my friends,\" said Winfried, \"how sweet and peaceful is  this convent to-night, on the eve of the nativity of the Prince of  Peace! It is a garden full of flowers in the heart of winter; a  nest among the branches of a great tree shaken by the winds; a  still haven on the edge of a tempestuous sea. And this is what  religion means for those who are chosen and called to quietude and  prayer and meditation.    \"But out yonder in the wide forest, who knows what storms are  raving to-night in the hearts of men, though all the woods are  still? who knows what haunts of wrath and cruelty and fear are  closed to-night against the advent of the Prince of Peace? And  shall I tell you what religion means to those who are called and  chosen to dare and to fight, and to conquer the world for Christ?  It means to launch out into the deep. It means to go against the  strongholds of the adversary. It means to struggle to win an  entrance for their Master everywhere. What helmet is strong enough  for this strife save the helmet of salvation? What breastplate can  guard a man against these fiery darts but the breastplate of  righteousness? What shoes can stand the wear of these journeys but  the preparation of the gospel of peace?\"    \"Shoes?\" he cried again, and laughed as if a sudden thought had  struck him. He thrust out his foot, covered with a heavy cowhide  boot, laced high about his leg with thongs of skin.    \"See here,--how a fighting man of the cross is shod! I have seen  the boots of the Bishop of Tours,--white kid, broidered with silk;  a day in the bogs would tear them to shreds. I have seen the  sandals that the monks use on the highroads,--yes, and worn them;  ten pair of them have I worn out and thrown away in a single  journey. Now I shoe my feet with the toughest hides, hard as iron;  no rock can cut them, no branches can tear them. Yet more than one  pair of these have I outworn, and many more shall I outwear ere my  journeys are ended. And I think, if God is gracious to me, that I  shall die wearing them. Better so than in a soft bed with silken  coverings. The boots of a warrior, a hunter, a woodsman,--these  are my preparation of the gospel of peace.\"    \"Come, Gregor,\" he said, laying his brown hand on the youth's  shoulder, \"come, wear the forester's boots with me. This is the  life to which we are called. Be strong in the Lord, a hunter of  the demons, a subduer of the wilderness, a woodsman of the faith.  Come!\"    The boy's eyes sparkled. He turned to his grandmother. She shook  her head vigorously.    \"Nay, father,\" she said, \"draw not the lad away from my side with  these wild words. I need him to help me with my labours, to cheer  my old age.\"    \"Do you need him more than the Master does?\" asked Winfried; \"and  will you take the wood that is fit for a bow to make a distaff?\"    \"But I fear for the child. Thy life is too hard for him. He will  perish with hunger in the woods.\"    \"Once,\" said Winfried, smiling, \"we were camped by the bank of the  river Ohru. The table was spread for the morning meal, but my  comrades cried that it was empty; the provisions were exhausted;  we must go without breakfast, and perhaps starve before we could  escape from the wilderness. While they complained, a fish-hawk  flew up from the river with flapping wings, and let fall a great  pike in the midst of the camp. There was food enough and to spare.  Never have I seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging  bread.\"    \"But the fierce pagans of the forest,\" cried the abbess,--\"they  may pierce the boy with their arrows, or dash out his brains with  their axes. He is but a child, too young for the dangers of  strife.\"    \"A child in years,\" replied Winfried, \"but a man in spirit. And if  the hero must fall early in the battle, he wears the brighter  crown, not a leaf withered, not a flower fallen.\"    The aged princess trembled a little. She drew Gregor close to her  side, and laid her hand gently on his brown hair.    \"I am not sure that he wants to leave me yet. Besides, there is no  horse in the stable to give him, now, and he cannot go as befits  the grandson of a king.\"    Gregor looked straight into her eyes.    \"Grandmother,\" said he, \"dear grandmother, if thou wilt not give  me a horse to ride with this man of God, I will go with him  afoot.\"    [Illustration--The fields around lay bare to the moon.]        II    THE TRAIL THROUGH THE FOREST      II    Two years had passed, to a day, almost to an hour, since that  Christmas eve in the cloister of Pfalzel. A little company of  pilgrims, less than a score a men, were creeping slowly northward  through the wide forest that rolled over the hills of central  Germany.    At the head of the band marched Winfried, clad in a tunic of fur,  with his long black robe girt high about his waist, so that it  might not hinder his stride. His hunter's boots were crusted with  snow. Drops of ice sparkled like jewels along the thongs that  bound his legs. There was no other ornament to his dress except  the bishop's cross hanging on his breast, and the broad silver  clasp that fastened his cloak about his neck. He carried a strong,  tall staff in his hand, fashioned at the top into the form of a  cross.    Close beside him, keeping step like a familiar comrade, was the  young Prince Gregor. Long marches through the wilderness had  stretched his limbs and broadened his back, and made a man of him  in stature as well as in spirit. His jacket and cap were of  wolfskin, and on his shoulder he carried an axe, with broad,  shining blade. He was a mighty woodsman now, and could make a  spray of chips fly around him as he hewed his way through the  trunk of spruce-tree.    Behind these leaders followed a pair of teamsters, guiding a rude  sledge, loaded with food and the equipage of the camp, and drawn  by two big, shaggy horses, blowing thick clouds of steam from  their frosty nostrils. Tiny icicles hung from the hairs on their  lips. Their flanks were smoking. They sank above the fetlocks at  every step in the soft snow.    Last of all came the rear guard, armed with bows and javelins. It  was no child's play, in those days, to cross Europe afoot.    The weird woodland, sombre and illimitable, covered hill and vale,  tableland and mountain-peak. There were wide moors where the  wolves hunted in packs as if the devil drove them, and tangled  thickets where the lynx and the boar made their lairs. Fierce  bears lurked among the rocky passes, and had not yet learned to  fear the face of man. The gloomy recesses of the forest gave  shelter to inhabitants who were still more cruel and dangerous  than beasts of prey,--outlaws and sturdy robbers and mad  were-wolves and bands of wandering pillagers.    The pilgrim who would pass from the mouth of the Tiber to the  mouth of the Rhine must travel with a little army of retainers, or  else trust in God and keep his arrows loose in the quiver.    The travellers were surrounded by an ocean of trees, so vast, so  full of endless billows, that it seemed to be pressing on every  side to overwhelm them. Gnarled oaks, with branches twisted and  knotted as if in rage, rose in groves like tidal waves. Smooth  forests of beech-trees, round and gray, swept over the knolls and  slopes of land in a mighty ground-swell. But most of all, the  multitude of pines and firs, innumerable and monotonous, with  straight, stark trunks, and branches woven together in an unbroken  Hood of darkest green, crowded through the valleys and over the  hills, rising on the highest ridges into ragged crests, like the  foaming edge of breakers.    Through this sea of shadows ran a narrow stream of shining  whiteness,--an ancient Roman road, covered with snow. It was as if  some great ship had ploughed through the green ocean long ago, and  left behind it a thick, smooth wake of foam. Along this open track  the travellers held their way,--heavily, for the drifts were deep;  warily, for the hard winter had driven many packs of wolves down  from the moors.    The steps of the pilgrims were noiseless; but the sledges creaked  over the dry snow, and the panting of the horses throbbed through  the still, cold air. The pale-blue shadows on the western side of  the road grew longer. The sun, declining through its shallow arch,  dropped behind the tree-tops. Darkness followed swiftly, as if it  had been a bird of prey waiting for this sign to swoop down upon  the world.    \"Father,\" said Gregor to the leader, \"surely this day's march is  done. It is time to rest, and eat, and sleep. If we press onward  now, we cannot see our steps; and will not that be against the  word of the psalmist David, who bids us not to put confidence in  the legs of a man?\"    Winfried laughed. \"Nay, my son Gregor,\" said he, \"thou hast  tripped, even now, upon thy text. For David said only, 'I take no  pleasure in the legs of a man.' And so say I, for I am not minded  to spare thy legs or mine, until we come farther on our way, and  do what must be done this night. Draw the belt tighter, my son,  and hew me out this tree that is fallen across the road, for our  campground is not here.\"    The youth obeyed; two of the foresters sprang to help him; and  while the soft fir-wood yielded to the stroke of the axes, and the  snow flew from the bending branches, Winfried turned and spoke to  his followers in a cheerful voice, that refreshed them like wine.    \"Courage, brothers, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16140"],[0,"The Curious Book of Birds (#2)"],[1," MAGPIE'S KINDERGARTEN      Did you ever notice how different are the nests which the birds build in  springtime, in tree or bush or sandy bank or hidden in the grass? Some  are wonderfully wrought, pretty little homes for birdikins. But others  are clumsy, and carelessly fastened to the bough, most unsafe cradles  for the feathered baby on the treetop. Sometimes after a heavy wind you  find on the ground under the nest poor little broken eggs which rolled  out and lost their chance of turning into birds with safe, safe wings of  their own. Now such sad things as this happen because in their youth the  lazy father and mother birds did not learn their lesson when Mother  Magpie had her class in nest-making. The clumsiest nest of all is that  which the Wood-Pigeon tries to build. Indeed, it is not a nest at all,  only the beginning of one. And there is an old story about this, which I  shall tell you.    In the early springtime of the world, when birds were first made, none  of them--except Mother Magpie--knew how to build a nest. In that lovely  garden where they lived the birds went fluttering about trying their new  wings, so interested in this wonderful game of flying that they forgot  all about preparing a home for the baby birds who were to come. When the  time came to lay their eggs the parents knew not what to do. There was  no place safe from the four-legged creatures who cannot fly, and they  began to twitter helplessly: \"Oh, how I wish I had a nice warm nest for  my eggs!\" \"Oh, what shall we do for a home?\" \"Dear me! I don't know  anything about housekeeping.\" And the poor silly things ruffled up their  feathers and looked miserable as only a little bird can look when it is  unhappy.    All except Mother Magpie! She was not the best--oh, no!--but she was the  cleverest and wisest of all the birds; it seemed as if she knew  everything that a bird could know. Already she had found out a way, and  was busily building a famous nest for herself. She was indeed a clever  bird! She gathered turf and sticks, and with clay bound them firmly  together in a stout elm tree. About her house she built a fence of  thorns to keep away the burglar birds who had already begun mischief  among their peaceful neighbors. Thus she had a snug and cosy dwelling  finished before the others even suspected what she was doing. She popped  into her new house and sat there comfortably, peering out through the  window-slits with her sharp little eyes. And she saw the other birds  hopping about and twittering helplessly.    \"What silly birds they are!\" she croaked. \"Ha, ha! What would they not  give for a nest like mine!\"    But presently a sharp-eyed Sparrow spied Mother Magpie sitting in her  nest.    \"Oho! Look there!\" he cried. \"Mother Magpie has found a way. Let us ask  her to teach us.\"    Then all the other birds chirped eagerly, \"Yes, yes! Let us ask her to  teach us!\"    So, in a great company, they came fluttering, hopping, twittering up to  the elm tree where Mother Magpie nestled comfortably in her new house.    \"O wise Mother Magpie, dear Mother Magpie,\" they cried, \"teach us how to  build our nests like yours, for it is growing night, and we are tired  and sleepy.\"    The Magpie said she would teach them if they would be a patient,  diligent, obedient class of little birds. And they all promised that  they would.    She made them perch about her in a great circle, some on the lower  branches of the trees, some on the bushes, and some on the ground among  the grass and flowers. And where each bird perched, there it was to  build its nest. Then Mother Magpie found clay and bits of twigs and moss  and grass--everything a bird could need to build a nest; and there is  scarcely anything you can think of which some bird would not find very  useful. When these things were all piled up before her she told every  bird to do just as she did. It was like a great big kindergarten of  birds playing at a new building game, with Mother Magpie for the  teacher.    She began to show them how to weave the bits of things together into  nests, as they should be made. And some of the birds, who were attentive  and careful, soon saw how it was done, and started nice homes for  themselves. You have seen what wonderful swinging baskets the Oriole  makes for his baby-cradle? Well, it was the Magpie who taught him how,  and he was the prize pupil, to be sure. But some of the birds were not  like him, nor like the patient little Wren. Some of them were lazy and  stupid and envious of Mother Magpie's cosy nest, which was already  finished, while theirs was yet to do.    As Mother Magpie worked, showing them how, it seemed so very simple that  they were ashamed not to have discovered it for themselves. So, as she  went on bit by bit, the silly things pretended that they had known all  about it from the first--which was very unpleasant for their teacher.    Mother Magpie took two sticks in her beak and began like this: \"First of  all, my friends, you must lay two sticks crosswise for a foundation,  thus,\" and she placed them carefully on the branch before her.    \"Oh yes, oh yes!\" croaked old Daddy Crow, interrupting her rudely. \"I  thought that was the way to begin.\"    Mother Magpie snapped her eyes at him and went on, \"Next you must lay a  feather on a bit of moss, to start the walls.\"    \"Certainly, of course,\" screamed the Jackdaw. \"I knew that came next.  That is what I told the Parrot but a moment since.\"    Mother Magpie looked at him impatiently, but she did not say anything.  \"Then, my friends, you must place on your foundation moss, hair,  feathers, sticks, and grass--whatever you choose for your house. You  must place them like _this_.\"    \"Yes, yes,\" cried the Starling, \"sticks and grass, every one knows how  to do that! Of course, of course! Tell us something new.\"    [Illustration: _\"Next you must lay a feather\"_]    Now Mother Magpie was very angry, but she kept on with her lesson in  spite of these rude and silly interruptions. She turned toward the  Wood-Pigeon, who was a rattle-pated young thing, and who was not having  any success with the sticks which she was trying to place.    \"Here, Wood-Pigeon,\" said Mother Magpie, \"you must place those sticks  through and across, criss-cross, criss-cross, _so_.\"    \"Criss-cross, criss-cross, so,\" interrupted the Wood-Pigeon. \"I know.  That will do-o-o, that will do-o-o!\"    Mother Magpie hopped up and down on one leg, so angry she could hardly  croak.    \"You silly Pigeon,\" she sputtered, \"not _so_. You are spoiling your  nest. Place the sticks _so_!\"    \"I know, I know! That will do-o-o, that will do-o-o!\" cooed the  Wood-Pigeon obstinately in her soft, foolish little voice, without  paying the least attention to Mother Magpie's directions.    \"We all know that--anything more?\" chirped the chorus of birds, trying  to conceal how anxious they were to know what came next, for the nests  were only half finished.    But Mother Magpie was thoroughly disgusted, and refused to go on with  the lesson which had been so rudely interrupted by her pupils.    \"You are all so wise, friends,\" she said, \"that surely you do not need  any help from me. You say you know all about it,--then go on and finish  your nests by yourselves. Much luck may you have!\" And away she flew to  her own cosy nest in the elm tree, where she was soon fast asleep,  forgetting all about the matter.    But oh! What a pickle the other birds were in! The lesson was but half  finished, and most of them had not the slightest idea what to do next.  That is why to this day many of the birds have never learned to build a  perfect nest. Some do better than others, but none build like Mother  Magpie.    But the Wood-Pigeon was in the worst case of them all. For she had only  the foundation laid criss-cross as the Magpie had shown her. And so, if  you find in the woods the most shiftless, silly kind of nest that you  can imagine--just a platform of sticks laid flat across a branch, with  no railing to keep the eggs from rolling out, no roof to keep the rain  from soaking in--when you see that foolishness, you will know that it is  the nest of little Mistress Wood-Pigeon, who was too stupid to learn the  lesson which Mother Magpie was ready to teach.    And the queerest part of all is that the birds blamed the Magpie for the  whole matter, and have never liked her since. But, as you may have  found out for yourselves, that is often the fate of wise folk who make  discoveries or who do things better than others.          THE GORGEOUS GOLDFINCH      The Goldfinch who lives in Europe is one of the gaudiest of the little  feathered brothers. He is a very Joseph of birds in his coat of many  colors, and folk often wonder how he came to have feathers so much more  gorgeous than his kindred. But after you have read this tale you will  wonder no longer.    You must know that when the Father first made all the birds they were  dressed alike in plumage of sober gray. But this dull uniform pleased  Him no more than it did the birds themselves, who begged that they might  wear each the particular style which was most becoming, and by which  they could be recognized afar.    So the Father called the birds to Him, one by one, as they stood in  line, and dipping His brush in the rainbow color-box painted each  appropriately in the colors which it wears to-day. (Except, indeed, that  some had later adventures which altered their original hues, as you  shall hear in due season.)    But the Goldfinch did not come with the other birds. That tardy little  fellow was busy elsewhere on his own affairs and heeded not the Father's  command to fall in line and wait his turn for being made beautiful.    So it happened that not until the painting was finished and all the  birds had flown away to admire themselves in the water-mirrors of the  earth, did the Goldfinch present himself at the Father's feet out of  breath.    \"O Father!\" he panted, \"I am late. But I was "]]]
