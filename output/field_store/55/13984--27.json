By nature is meant those inherent properties and necessary relations  derived from the realities of things. And these realities of things,  though in the utmost diversity, are yet intimately connected one with the  other. For these diverse realities an all-unifying agency is needed that  shall link them all one to the other. For instance, the various organs and  members, the parts and elements, that constitute the body of man, though  at variance, are yet all connected one with the other by that all-unifying  agency known as the human soul, that causeth them to function in perfect  harmony and with absolute regularity, thus making the continuation of life  possible. The human body, however, is utterly unconscious of that  all-unifying agency, and yet acteth with regularity and dischargeth its  functions according to its will.    Now concerning philosophers, they are of two schools. Thus Socrates the  wise believed in the unity of God and the existence of the soul after  death; as his opinion was contrary to that of the narrow-minded people of  his time, that divine sage was poisoned by them. All divine philosophers  and men of wisdom and understanding, when observing these endless beings,  have considered that in this great and infinite universe all things end in  the mineral kingdom, that the outcome of the mineral kingdom is the  vegetable kingdom, the outcome of the vegetable kingdom is the animal  kingdom and the outcome of the animal kingdom the world of man. The  consummation of this limitless universe with all its grandeur and glory  hath been man himself, who in this world of being toileth and suffereth  for a time, with divers ills and pains, and ultimately disintegrates,  leaving no trace and no fruit after him. Were it so, there is no doubt  that this infinite universe with all its perfections has ended in sham and  delusion with no result, no fruit, no permanence and no effect. It would  be utterly without meaning. They were thus convinced that such is not the  case, that this Great Workshop with all its power, its bewildering  magnificence and endless perfections, cannot eventually come to naught.  That still another life should exist is thus certain, and, just as the  vegetable kingdom is unaware of the world of man, so we, too, know not of  the Great Life hereafter that followeth the life of man here below. Our  non-comprehension of that life, however, is no proof of its non-existence.  The mineral world, for instance, is utterly unaware of the world of man  and cannot comprehend it, but the ignorance of a thing is no proof of its  non-existence. Numerous and conclusive proofs exist that go to show that  this infinite world cannot end with this human life.    Now concerning the Essence of Divinity: in truth it is on no account  determined by anything apart from its own nature, and can in no wise be  comprehended. For whatsoever can be conceived by man is a reality that  hath limitations and is not unlimited; it is circumscribed, not  all-embracing. It can be comprehended by man, and is controlled by him.  Similarly it is certain that all human conceptions are contingent, not  absolute; that they have a mental existence, not a material one. Moreover,  differentiation of stages in the contingent world is an obstacle to  understanding. How then can the contingent conceive the Reality of the  absolute? As previously mentioned, differentiation of stages in the  contingent plane is an obstacle to understanding. Minerals, plants and  animals are bereft of the mental faculties of man that discover the  realities of all things, but man himself comprehendeth all the stages  beneath him. Every superior stage comprehendeth that which is inferior and  discovereth the reality thereof, but the inferior one is unaware of that  which is superior and cannot comprehend it. Thus man cannot grasp the  Essence of Divinity, but can, by his reasoning power, by observation, by  his intuitive faculties and the revealing power of his faith, believe in  God, discover the bounties of His Grace. He becometh certain that though  the Divine Essence is unseen of the eye, and the existence of the Deity is  intangible, yet conclusive spiritual proofs assert the existence of that  unseen Reality. The Divine Essence as it is in itself is however beyond  all description. For instance, the nature of ether is unknown, but that it  existeth is certain by the effects it produceth, heat, light and  electricity being the waves thereof. By these waves the existence of ether  is thus proven. And as we consider the outpourings of Divine Grace we are  assured of the existence of God. For instance, we observe that the  existence of beings is conditioned upon the coming together of various  elements and their non-existence upon the decomposition of their  constituent elements. For decomposition causeth the dissociation of the  various elements. Thus, as we observe the coming together of elements  giveth rise to the existence of beings, and knowing that beings are  infinite, they being the effect, how can the Cause be finite?    Now, formation is of three kinds and of three kinds only: accidental,  necessary and voluntary. The coming together of the various constituent  elements of beings cannot be accidental, for unto every effect there must  be a cause. It cannot be compulsory, for then the formation must be an  inherent property of the constituent parts and the inherent property of a  thing can in no wise be dissociated from it, such as light that is the  revealer of things, heat that causeth the expansion of elements and the  solar rays which are the essential property of the sun. Thus under such  circumstances the decomposition of any formation is impossible, for the  inherent properties of a thing cannot be separated from it. The third  formation remaineth and that is the voluntary one, that is, an unseen  force described as the Ancient Power, causeth these elements to come  together, every formation giving rise to a distinct being.    As to the attributes and perfections such as will, knowledge, power and  other ancient attributes that we ascribe to that Divine Reality, these are  the signs that reflect the existence of beings in the visible plane and  not the absolute perfections of the Divine Essence that cannot be  comprehended. For instance, as we consider created things we observe  infinite perfections, and the created things being in the utmost  regularity and perfection we infer that the Ancient Power on whom  dependeth the existence of these beings, cannot be ignorant; thus we say  He is All-Knowing. It is certain that it is not impotent, it must be then  All-Powerful; it is not poor, it must be All-Possessing; it is not  non-existent, it must be Ever-Living. The purpose is to show that these  attributes and perfections that we recount for that Universal Reality are  only in order to deny imperfections, rather than to assert the perfections  that the human mind can conceive. Thus we say His attributes are  unknowable.    In fine, that Universal Reality with all its qualities and attributes that  we recount is holy and exalted above all minds and understandings. As we,  however, reflect with broad minds upon this infinite universe, we observe  that motion without a motive force, and an effect without a cause are both  impossible; that every being hath come to exist under numerous influences  and continually undergoeth reaction. These influences, too, are formed  under the action of still other influences. For instance, plants grow and  flourish through the outpourings of vernal showers, whilst the cloud  itself is formed under various other agencies and these agencies in their  turn are reacted upon by still other agencies. For example, plants and  animals grow and develop under the influence of what the philosophers of  our day designate as hydrogen and oxygen and are reacted upon by the  effects of these two elements; and these in turn are formed under still  other influences. The same can be said of other beings whether they affect  other things or be affected. Such process of causation goes on, and to  maintain that this process goes on indefinitely is manifestly absurd. Thus  such a chain of causation must of necessity lead eventually to Him who is  the Ever-Living, the All-Powerful, who is Self-Dependent and the Ultimate  Cause. This Universal Reality cannot be sensed, it cannot be seen. It must  be so of necessity, for it is All-Embracing, not circumscribed, and such  attributes qualify the effect and not the cause.    And as we reflect, we observe that man is like unto a tiny organism  contained within a fruit; this fruit hath developed out of the blossom,  the blossom hath grown out of the tree, the tree is sustained by the sap,  and the sap formed out of earth and water. How then can this tiny organism  comprehend the nature of the garden, conceive of the gardener and  comprehend his being? That is manifestly impossible. Should that organism  understand and reflect, it would observe that this garden, this tree, this  blossom, this fruit would in no wise have come to exist by themselves in  such order and perfection. Similarly the wise and reflecting soul will  know of a certainty that this infinite universe with all its grandeur and  perfect order could not have come to exist by itself.    Similarly in the world of being there exist forces unseen of the eye, such  as the force of ether previously mentioned, that cannot be sensed, that  cannot be seen. However, from the effects it produceth, that is from its  waves and vibrations, light, heat, electricity appear and are made  evident. In like manner is the power of growth, of feeling, of  understanding, of thought, of memory, of imagination and of discernment;  all these inner faculties are unseen of the eye and cannot be sensed, yet  all are evident by the effects they produce.    Now as to the infinite"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19296"],[0,"Tablets of the Divine Plan (#2)"],[1,"and steadfastness--day and night they  have no other intention save the diffusion of the fragrances of God, they  have no other hope except the promotion of the heavenly teachings, like  the candles they are burning with the light of the love of God, and like  thankful birds are singing songs, spirit-imparting, joy-creating, in the  rose garden of the knowledge of God--yet in the states of Indiana, Iowa,  Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas few of the  believers exist. So far the summons of the Kingdom of God and the  proclamation of the oneness of the world of humanity has not been made in  these states systematically and enthusiastically. Blessed souls and  detached teachers have not traveled through these parts repeatedly;  therefore these states are still in a state of heedlessness. Through the  efforts of the friends of God souls must be likewise enkindled in these  states, with the fire of the love of God and attracted to the Kingdom of  God, so that section may also become illumined and the soul imparting  breeze of the rose garden of the Kingdom may perfume the nostrils of the  inhabitants. Therefore, if it is possible, send to those parts teachers  who are severed from all else save God, sanctified and pure. If these  teachers be in the utmost state of attraction, in a short time great  results will be forthcoming. The sons and daughters of the kingdom are  like unto the real farmers. Through whichever state or country they pass  they display self-sacrifice and sow divine seeds. From that seed harvests  are produced. On this subject it is revealed in the glorious Gospel: When  the pure seeds are scattered in the good ground heavenly blessing and  benediction is obtained.(6) I hope that you may become assisted and  confirmed, and never lose courage in the promotion of the divine  teachings. Day by day may you add to your effort, exertion, and  magnanimity.    4 Upon you be greeting and praise!            4: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE WESTERN STATES      _Revealed on April 1, 1916, in 'Abdu'l-Baha's room at the house in Bahji,  addressed to the Baha'is of eleven Western States of the United States:  New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, California, Wyoming, Utah, Montana,  Idaho, Oregon and Washington. _    1                                   _He is God!_    O ye sons and daughters of the Kingdom:    2 Day and night I have no other occupation than the remembrance of the  friends, praying from the depth of my heart in their behalf, begging for  them confirmation from the Kingdom of God and supplicating the direct  effect of the breaths of the Holy Spirit. I am hopeful from the favors of  His Highness the Lord of Bestowals, that the friends of God during such a  time may become the secret cause of the illumination of the hearts of  humanity, breathing the breath of life upon the spirits--whose praiseworthy  results may become conducive to the glory and exaltation of humankind  throughout all eternity. Although in some of the Western States, like  California, Oregon, Washington and Colorado, the fragrances of holiness  are diffused, numerous souls have taken a share and a portion from the  fountain of everlasting life, they have obtained heavenly benediction,  have drunk an overflowing cup from the wine of the love of God and have  hearkened to the melody of the Supreme Concourse--yet in the states of New  Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Arizona and Nevada, the lamp of the  love of God is not ignited in a befitting and behooving manner, and the  call of the Kingdom of God has not been raised. Now, if it is possible,  show ye an effort in this direction. Either travel yourselves, personally,  throughout those states or choose others and send them, so that they may  teach the souls. For the present those states are like unto dead bodies:  they must breathe into them the breath of life and bestow upon them a  heavenly spirit. Like unto the stars they must shine in that horizon and  thus the rays of the Sun of Reality may also illumine those states.    3 God says in the great Qur'an: \"Verily God is the helper of those who  have believed. He will lead them from darkness into light.\"(7) This means:  God loves the believers, consequently He will deliver them from darkness  and bring them into the world of light.    4 It is also recorded in the blessed Gospel: Travel ye throughout the  world and call ye the people to the Kingdom of God.(8) Now this is the  time that you may arise and perform this most great service and become the  cause of the guidance of innumerable souls. Thus through this superhuman  service the rays of peace and conciliation may illumine and enlighten all  the regions and the world of humanity may find peace and composure.    5 During my stay in America I cried out in every meeting and summoned the  people to the propagation of the ideals of universal peace. I said plainly  that the continent of Europe had become like unto an arsenal and its  conflagration was dependent upon one spark, and that in the coming years,  or within two years, all that which is recorded in the Revelation of John  and the Book of Daniel would become fulfilled and come to pass. This  matter, in all probability, was published in the San Francisco Bulletin,  October 12, 1912. You may refer to it, so that the truth may become clear  and manifest; thus ye may fully realize that this is the time for the  diffusion of the fragrances.    6 The magnanimity of man must be heavenly or, in other words, it must be  assisted by the divine confirmation, so that he may become the cause of  the illumination of the world of humanity.    7 Upon you be greeting and praise!            5: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF CANADA AND GREENLAND      _Revealed on April 5, 1916, in the garden adjacent to the Shrine of  Baha'u'llah, and addressed to the Baha'is of Canada--Newfoundland, Prince  Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,  Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, Mackenzie, Keewatin, Ungava,  Franklin Islands--and Greenland. _    1                                   _He is God!_    O ye daughters and sons of the Kingdom:    2 Although in most of the states and cities of the United States, praise  be to God, His fragrances are diffused, and souls unnumbered are turning  their faces and advancing toward the Kingdom of God, yet in some of the  states the Standard of Unity is not yet upraised as it should be, nor are  the mysteries of the Holy Books, such as the Bible, the Gospel, and the  Qur'an, unraveled. Through the concerted efforts of all the friends the  Standard of Unity must needs be unfurled in those states, and the divine  teachings promoted, so that these states may also receive their portion of  the heavenly bestowals and a share of the Most Great Guidance. Likewise in  the provinces of Canada, such as Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova  Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta,  British Columbia, Ungava, Keewatin, Mackenzie, Yukon, and the Franklin  Islands in the Arctic Circle--the believers of God must become  self-sacrificing and like unto the candles of guidance become ignited in  the provinces of Canada. Should they show forth such a magnanimity, it is  assured that they will obtain universal divine confirmations, the heavenly  cohorts will reinforce them uninterruptedly, and a most great victory will  be obtained. God willing, the call of the Kingdom may reach the ears of  the Eskimos, the inhabitants of the Islands of Franklin in the north of  Canada, as well as Greenland. Should the fire of the love of God be  kindled in Greenland, all the ice of that country will be melted, and its  cold weather become temperate--that is, if the hearts be touched with the  heat of the love of God, that territory will become a divine rose garden  and a heavenly paradise, and the souls, even as fruitful trees, will  acquire the utmost freshness and beauty. Effort, the utmost effort, is  required. Should you display an effort, so that the fragrances of God may  be diffused among the Eskimos, its effect will be very great and  far-reaching. God says in the great Qur'an: A day will come wherein the  lights of unity will enlighten all the world. \"The earth will be  irradiated with the light of its Lord.\"(9) In other words, the earth will  become illumined with the light of God. That light is the light of unity.  \"There is no God but God.\" The continent and the islands of Eskimos are  also parts of this earth. They must similarly receive a portion of the  bestowals of the Most Great Guidance.    3 Upon you be greeting and praise!            6: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA      _Revealed on April 8, 1916, in the garden outside the Shrine of  Baha'u'llah, and addressed to the Baha'is of the United States and Canada.  _    1                                   _He is God!_    O ye blessed souls:    2 I desire for you eternal success and prosperity and beg perfect  confirmation for each one in the divine world. My hope for you is that  each one may shine forth like unto the morning star from the horizon of  the world and in this Garden of God become a blessed tree, producing  everlasting fruits and results.    3 Therefore I direct you to that which is conducive to your heavenly  confirmation and illumination in the Kingdom of God!    4 It is this: Alaska is a vast country; although one of the maidservants  of the Merciful has hastened to those parts, serving as a librarian in the  public library, and according to her ability is not failing in teaching  the Cause, yet the call of the Kingdom of God is not yet raised through  that spacious territory.    5 His Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the  world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God.(10) Hence the mercy of  God must encompass all humanity. Therefore do ye not think it permissible  to leave that region deprived of the breezes "]]]
