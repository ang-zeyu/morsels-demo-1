Surely not. And can they say  of any system tried that it proved other than a failure in the end? My  dear Philippe, the future is to be read with certainty only in the  past. Ab actu ad posse valet consecutio. Man never changes. He is always  greedy, always acquisitive, always vile. I am speaking of Man in the  bulk.\"    \"Do you pretend that it is impossible to ameliorate the lot of the  people?\" M. de Vilmorin challenged him.    \"When you say the people you mean, of course, the populace. Will you  abolish it? That is the only way to ameliorate its lot, for as long as  it remains populace its lot will be damnation.\"    \"You argue, of course, for the side that employs you. That is natural, I  suppose.\" M. de Vilmorin spoke between sorrow and indignation.    \"On the contrary, I seek to argue with absolute detachment. Let us  test these ideas of yours. To what form of government do you aspire? A  republic, it is to be inferred from what you have said. Well, you have  it already. France in reality is a republic to-day.\"    Philippe stared at him. \"You are being paradoxical, I think. What of the  King?\"    \"The King? All the world knows there has been no king in France since  Louis XIV. There is an obese gentleman at Versailles who wears the  crown, but the very news you bring shows for how little he really  counts. It is the nobles and clergy who sit in the high places, with the  people of France harnessed under their feet, who are the real rulers.  That is why I say that France is a republic; she is a republic built  on the best pattern--the Roman pattern. Then, as now, there were great  patrician families in luxury, preserving for themselves power and  wealth, and what else is accounted worth possessing; and there was  the populace crushed and groaning, sweating, bleeding, starving, and  perishing in the Roman kennels. That was a republic; the mightiest we  have seen.\"    Philippe strove with his impatience. \"At least you will admit--you have,  in fact, admitted it--that we could not be worse governed than we are?\"    \"That is not the point. The point is should we be better governed if we  replaced the present ruling class by another? Without some guarantee of  that I should be the last to lift a finger to effect a change. And what  guarantees can you give? What is the class that aims at government? I  will tell you. The bourgeoisie.\"    \"What?\"    \"That startles you, eh? Truth is so often disconcerting. You hadn't  thought of it? Well, think of it now. Look well into this Nantes  manifesto. Who are the authors of it?\"    \"I can tell you who it was constrained the municipality of Nantes to  send it to the King. Some ten thousand workmen--shipwrights, weavers,  labourers, and artisans of every kind.\"    \"Stimulated to it, driven to it, by their employers, the wealthy traders  and shipowners of that city,\" Andre-Louis replied. \"I have a habit of  observing things at close quarters, which is why our colleagues of the  Literary Chamber dislike me so cordially in debate. Where I delve they  but skim. Behind those labourers and artisans of Nantes, counselling  them, urging on these poor, stupid, ignorant toilers to shed their blood  in pursuit of the will o' the wisp of freedom, are the sail-makers, the  spinners, the ship-owners and the slave-traders. The slave-traders! The  men who live and grow rich by a traffic in human flesh and blood in  the colonies, are conducting at home a campaign in the sacred name  of liberty! Don't you see that the whole movement is a movement of  hucksters and traders and peddling vassals swollen by wealth into envy  of the power that lies in birth alone? The money-changers in Paris  who hold the bonds in the national debt, seeing the parlous financial  condition of the State, tremble at the thought that it may lie in  the power of a single man to cancel the debt by bankruptcy. To secure  themselves they are burrowing underground to overthrow a state and build  upon its ruins a new one in which they shall be the masters. And to  accomplish this they inflame the people. Already in Dauphiny we have  seen blood run like water--the blood of the populace, always the blood of  the populace. Now in Brittany we may see the like. And if in the end the  new ideas prevail? if the seigneurial rule is overthrown, what then?  You will have exchanged an aristocracy for a plutocracy. Is that worth  while? Do you 'think that under money-changers and slave-traders and  men who have waxed rich in other ways by the ignoble arts of buying  and selling, the lot of the people will be any better than under their  priests and nobles? Has it ever occurred to you, Philippe, what it  is that makes the rule of the nobles so intolerable? Acquisitiveness.  Acquisitiveness is the curse of mankind. And shall you expect less  acquisitiveness in men who have built themselves up by acquisitiveness?  Oh, I am ready to admit that the present government is execrable,  unjust, tyrannical--what you will; but I beg you to look ahead, and to  see that the government for which it is aimed at exchanging it may be  infinitely worse.\"    Philippe sat thoughtful a moment. Then he returned to the attack.    \"You do not speak of the abuses, the horrible, intolerable abuses of  power under which we labour at present.\"    \"Where there is power there will always be the abuse of it.\"    \"Not if the tenure of power is dependent upon its equitable  administration.\"    \"The tenure of power is power. We cannot dictate to those who hold it.\"    \"The people can--the people in its might.\"    \"Again I ask you, when you say the people do you mean the populace? You  do. What power can the populace wield? It can run wild. It can burn  and slay for a time. But enduring power it cannot wield, because power  demands qualities which the populace does not possess, or it would  not be populace. The inevitable, tragic corollary of civilization is  populace. For the rest, abuses can be corrected by equity; and equity,  if it is not found in the enlightened, is not to be found at all. M.  Necker is to set about correcting abuses, and limiting privileges. That  is decided. To that end the States General are to assemble.\"    \"And a promising beginning we have made in Brittany, as Heaven hears  me!\" cried Philippe.    \"Pooh! That is nothing. Naturally the nobles will not yield without a  struggle. It is a futile and ridiculous struggle--but then... it is human  nature, I suppose, to be futile and ridiculous.\"    M. de Vilmorin became witheringly sarcastic. \"Probably you will also  qualify the shooting of Mabey as futile and ridiculous. I should even be  prepared to hear you argue in defence of the Marquis de La Tour  d'Azyr that his gamekeeper was merciful in shooting Mabey, since the  alternative would have been a life-sentence to the galleys.\"    Andre-Louis drank the remainder of his chocolate; set down his cup, and  pushed back his chair, his breakfast done.    \"I confess that I have not your big charity, my dear Philippe. I am  touched by Mabey's fate. But, having conquered the shock of this news to  my emotions, I do not forget that, after all, Mabey was thieving when he  met his death.\"    M. de Vilmorin heaved himself up in his indignation.    \"That is the point of view to be expected in one who is the assistant  fiscal intendant of a nobleman, and the delegate of a nobleman to the  States of Brittany.\"    \"Philippe, is that just? You are angry with me!\" he cried, in real  solicitude.    \"I am hurt,\" Vilmorin admitted. \"I am deeply hurt by your attitude. And  I am not alone in resenting your reactionary tendencies. Do you know  that the Literary Chamber is seriously considering your expulsion?\"    Andre-Louis shrugged. \"That neither surprises nor troubles me.\"    M. de Vilmorin swept on, passionately: \"Sometimes I think that you have  no heart. With you it is always the law, never equity. It occurs to me,  Andre, that I was mistaken in coming to you. You are not likely to be of  assistance to me in my interview with M. de Kercadiou.\" He took up his  hat, clearly with the intention of departing.    Andre-Louis sprang up and caught him by the arm.    \"I vow,\" said he, \"that this is the last time ever I shall consent to  talk law or politics with you, Philippe. I love you too well to quarrel  with you over other men's affairs.\"    \"But I make them my own,\" Philippe insisted vehemently.    \"Of course you do, and I love you for it. It is right that you should.  You are to be a priest; and everybody's business is a priest's business.  Whereas I am a lawyer--the fiscal intendant of a nobleman, as you  say--and a lawyer's business is the business of his client. That is the  difference between us. Nevertheless, you are not going to shake me off.\"    \"But I tell you frankly, now that I come to think of it, that I should  prefer you did not see M. de Kercadiou with me. Your duty to your client  cannot be a help to me.\"    His wrath had passed; but his determination remained firm, based upon  the reason he gave.    \"Very well,\" said Andre-Louis. \"It shall be as you please. But nothing  shall prevent me at least from walking with you as far as the chateau,  and waiting for you while you make your appeal to M. de Kercadiou.\"    And so they left the house good friends, for the sweetness of M. de  Vilmorin's nature did not admit of rancour, and together they took their  way up the steep main street of Gavrillac.            CHAPTER II. THE ARISTOCRAT    The sleepy village of Gavrillac, a half-league removed from the main  road to Rennes, and therefore undisturbed by the world's traffic, lay  in a curve of the River Meu, at the foot, and straggling halfway up the  slope, of the shallow hill that was crowned by the squat manor. By the  time Gavrillac had paid tribute to its seigneur--partly in money and  partly in service--tithes to the Church, and imposts to the King, it was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19487"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Hereford (#2)"],[1,"than of Milfrid's church. Soon  after it was finished Algar or Elfgar, Earl of Chester, son of the Earl of  Mercia, was charged with treason at a Witan in London, and (though his  guilt is still disputed) was outlawed by Edward the Confessor. He hired a  fleet of Danish pirate ships from the Irish coast, joined King Gruffydd in  Wales, and marched with him into Herefordshire, determining to make war  upon King Edward. Here they began with a victory about two miles from  Hereford over the Earl of that shire who was a Frenchman, and tried to  make his men fight on horseback in the French fashion, which they did not  understand,--the English way being for the great men to ride to the field  of battle, but there to dismount and fight with their heavy axes on foot.  Earl Ralph, the Frenchman, turned his horse's head and fled the field, and  the English, encumbered with their long spears and swords, followed helter  skelter. After killing some five hundred, AElfgar and Gruffydd turned to  Hereford and came upon the church which Bishop Athelstan had caused to be  built. There they met with a spirited resistance: amongst other victims  seven of the canons were killed in an attempt to hold the great door of  the minster; but, ultimately, the church and town were burned.    Earl Harold, son of Earl Godwin, himself, when it was too late, came with  half of his army to Hereford, and with his usual predilection for peace  (notwithstanding his valour) soon after removed the outlawry from AElfgar,  and quiet was restored.    In 1056, the year following this disaster, the worthy Bishop Athelstan  died at Bosbury. He had been blind for thirteen years before his death,  and a Welsh bishop had acted for him. His body was interred in the church  which he had \"built from the foundations,\" and we may therefore suppose  that the \"minster\" was not entirely destroyed.    In 1057, on the death of Earl Ralph, the Frenchman, so important was  Herefordshire, through its position on the Welsh borders, and, since it  had been strengthened by Harold, such an important military post was the  town of Hereford, that it became part of his earldom.    From 1055 to 1079 the minster is said to have been in ruins. At the latter  date Bishop Lozing (Robert de Losinga) began to rebuild the cathedral, and  there are vague accounts that it was in the form of a round church in  imitation of a basilica of Charlemagne which had been built at  Aix-la-Chapelle between 774 and 795. If such a form ever existed it must  have been completely destroyed, as the work of the Norman period that  remains is clearly English both in treatment and in detail. If this could  be proved to be Lozing's work, then it had no similarity to the Roman  style. The building begun by him was carried on by Bishop Raynelm, who  held the see from 1107 to 1115, and placed on a more regular basis the  establishment of canons living under a rule. These prebendaries or canons  did not live in common like the monks, but in separate houses near the  church. Whether he completed the building or not, Bishop Raynelm  undoubtedly made many additions and alterations.    We may here quote an interesting account of the duties of the cathedral  treasurer, which were probably settled about this time. They throw a  curious and suggestive light on the ceremonies of the period. \"At  Hereford,\" says Walcott, \"he found all the lights; three burning day and  night before the high altar; two burning there at matins daily, and at  mass, and the chief hours on festivals; three burning perpetually, viz.,  in the chapter-house, the second before S. Mary's altar, and the third  before the cross in the rood-loft; four before the high altar, and altar  on \"_Minus Duplicia_,\" and five tapers in basons, on principles, and  doubles, at mass, prime, and second vespers, four tapers before the high  altar, five in the basons, thirteen on the beam, and seven in the  candelabra; the paschal and portable tapers for processions. He kept the  keys of the treasury, copes, palls, vestments, ornaments, and the plate,  of which he rendered a yearly account to the dean and chapter. He found  three clerks to ring the bells, light the candles, and suspend the palls  and curtains on solemn days. He found hay at Christmas to strew the choir  and chapter-house, which at Easter was sprinkled with ivy leaves; and on  All Saints' day he provided mats.\"(1)    The next great changes were made under Bishop William de Vere (1186-1199).  His work was of transitional character, and bears much resemblance to the  beautiful transitional work at Glastonbury. He removed the three Norman  apsidal terminations at the east end, doubled the presbytery aisles, thus  making two side chapels in each transept which have since been replaced by  the Lady Chapel with its vestibule.    In a paper read before the Archaeological Institute in 1877, Sir G. G.  Scott suggests that the central apse projected one bay beyond the sides;  but this is merely conjecture. A curious feature in De Vere's work was his  putting columns in the middle of the central arch. It is probable that the  part of the presbytery we now have was but the beginning of a larger  scheme never carried out, which included building the presbytery and  dividing the eastern wall into two arches instead of one as at Lichfield  and Exeter.    According to Sir Gilbert Scott's theory, the Early English Lady Chapel was  an extension of the work of Bishop de Vere: it is especially interesting,  and an unique example of its date in being raised upon a crypt.    At the Bishop's palace was a splendid hall of which it seems likely De  Vere was the builder,--at any rate he must have been the first or second  occupier. It was of noble dimensions, being 110 feet in length, consisting  of a nave 23 feet broad, with aisles 16 feet wide, independently of the  columns. This was divided into five bays by pillars supporting timber  arches formed of two pieces of curved oak. Nearly the whole of the present  Bishop's palace is included within the space occupied by this grand hall.    In 1188 when Archbishop Baldwin made pilgrimage into Wales on behalf of  the crusade, he was entertained in this hall by Bishop de Vere, and  doubtless some of those who devoted themselves to the work were Hereford  men.    The central tower of the cathedral, that fine example of decorated work,  covered with its profusion of ball-flower ornament, was built by, or at  any rate during the episcopate of, Giles de Braose (1200-1215), an ardent  opponent of King John.    The remaining examples of decorated date are the inner north porch (as  distinct from the addition of Bishop Booth) and what remains of the  beautifully designed chapter-house, a decagon in plan, each side except  the one occupied by the entrance being subdivided into five seats.    During the term of office of Bishop Foliot (1219-1234), a tooth of St.  AEthelberht, whose remains had been almost entirely destroyed by AElfgar and  Gruffuth in 1055, was given to the cathedral. The donor of this precious  relic was Philip de Fauconberg, Canon of Hereford and Archdeacon of  Huntingdon.    The next Bishop, Ralph de Maydenstan, 1234-1239, presented some  service-books to the cathedral.    In 1240 Henry III., with his wonted preference for foreigners, appointed  to the Hereford bishopric, Peter of Savoy, generally known as Bishop  Aquablanca, from Aqua Bella, his birthplace, near Chambery. He it was who  rebuilt the north transept. He was one of the best hated men in England,  and not content with showering benefices upon his relations, he  perpetrated one of the greatest frauds in history in order to raise money  to aid the annexation schemes of Popes Innocent IV. and Alexander IV. Of  these, however, full particulars will be found in a chapter on the  Diocese.    While he was absent in Ireland collecting tithes, attended by a guard of  soldiers, Prince Edward, coming to Hereford to resist the encroachments of  Llewellyn, King of Wales, found there neither bishop, dean, nor canons  resident. For this they earned the severe reprimand of the King, and the  Bishop returned to Hereford. Shortly after, he was seized within the  cathedral precincts by the insurgent barons of Leicester's party, together  with all the foreign canons (who were his own relations). They were  carried to Eardisley Castle, where the spoil they had just brought from  Ireland was divided among the insurgents.    Bishop Aquablanca died soon after these events, in 1268. He was endowed  with a character full of contradictions, extreme aggressiveness, mingled  with remarkable tact.    When he got the better of the Hereford citizens, after their attempt to  encroach upon his episcopal rights, he remitted one full half of their  fine and devoted the other to the cathedral building. While he was showing  in his life a disgraceful example to the clergy of the country, at the  same time he gave liberally to the cathedral foundation in books,  ornaments, money, and land, left a rich legacy to the poor, and a lasting  monument in the rebuilding of the north transept of the cathedral itself.    With the exception of the arches, leading into the aisles of the nave and  choir, the Norman work of the transept was altogether demolished, and  replaced by another consisting of two bays with an eastern aisle. Over the  latter was built a story now used as the cathedral library, which is  approached from the north aisle of the presbytery by a staircase turret.  His tomb is one of the finest in the cathedral. Under it, together with  those of his nephew, a Dean of Hereford, are his own remains, except the  heart, which, as he had wished, was carried to his own country of Savoy.    In 1275 the Chapter of Hereford elected to the bishopric Thomas de  Cantilupe, one of the greatest men who has ever held that office, a man  whose life was in almost every way a remarkable contrast to that of his  predecessor, Bishop Aquablanca.
