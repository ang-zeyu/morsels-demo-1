He's forced to let the piping drop,      And we shall see our children stop!\"      When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side,      A wondrous portal opened wide,      As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;      And the Piper advanced and the children followed,      And when all were in to the very last,      The door in the mountain side shut fast.      Did I say, all? No; One was lame,      And could not dance the whole of the way;      And in after years, if you would blame      His sadness, he was used to say,--      \"It's dull in our town since my playmates left!      I can't forget that I'm bereft      Of all the pleasant sights they see,      Which the Piper also promised me.      For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,      Joining the town and just at hand,      Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew,      And flowers put forth a fairer hue,      And everything was strange and new;      The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,      And their dogs outran our fallow deer,      And honey-bees had lost their stings,      And horses were born with eagles' wings;      And just as I became assured      My lame foot would be speedily cured,      The music stopped and I stood still,      And found myself outside the hill,      Left alone against my will,      To go now limping as before,      And never hear of that country more!\"      XIV.        Alas, alas for Hamelin!        There came into many a burgher's pate        A text which says that Heaven's gate        Opes to the rich at as easy rate      As the needle's eye takes a camel in!      The Mayor sent East, West, North, and South,      To offer the Piper, by word of mouth,        Wherever it was men's lot to find him,      Silver and gold to his heart's content,      If he'd only return the way he went,        And bring the children behind him.      But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavour,      And Piper and dancers were gone for ever,      They made a decree that lawyers never        Should think their records dated duly      If, after the day of the month and year,      These words did not as well appear,      \"And so long after what happened here        On the Twenty-second of July,      Thirteen hundred and seventy-six:\"      And the better in memory to fix      The place of the children's last retreat,      They called it, the Pied Piper's Street--      Where any one playing on pipe or tabor,      Was sure for the future to lose his labour.      Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern        To shock with mirth a street so solemn;      But opposite the place of the cavern        They wrote the story on a column,      And on the great church-window painted      The same, to make the world acquainted      How their children were stolen away,      And there it stands to this very day.      And I must not omit to say      That in Transylvania there's a tribe      Of alien people that ascribe      The outlandish ways and dress      On which their neighbours lay such stress,      To their fathers and mothers having risen      Out of some subterraneous prison      Into which they were trepanned      Long time ago in a mighty band      Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,      But how or why, they don't understand.      XV.        So, Willy, let me and you be wipers      Of scores out with all men--especially pipers!      And, whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice,      If we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise!

Yet the story comes to us from Greece, which is, like the South of  France, the home of the olive-tree and the Cigale. Was AEsop really its  author, as tradition would have it? It is doubtful, and by no means a  matter of importance; at all events, the author was a Greek, and a  compatriot of the Cigale, which must have been perfectly familiar to  him. There is not a single peasant in my village so blind as to be  unaware of the total absence of Cigales in winter; and every tiller of  the soil, every gardener, is familiar with the first phase of the  insect, the larva, which his spade is perpetually discovering when he  banks up the olives at the approach of the cold weather, and he knows,  having seen it a thousand times by the edge of the country paths, how in  summer this larva issues from the earth from a little round well of its  own making; how it climbs a twig or a stem of grass, turns upon its  back, climbs out of its skin, drier now than parchment, and becomes the  Cigale; a creature of a fresh grass-green colour which is rapidly  replaced by brown.    We cannot suppose that the Greek peasant was so much less intelligent  than the Provencal that he can have failed to see what the least  observant must have noticed. He knew what my rustic neighbours know so  well. The scribe, whoever he may have been, who was responsible for the  fable was in the best possible circumstances for correct knowledge of  the subject. Whence, then, arose the errors of his tale?    Less excusably than La Fontaine, the Greek fabulist wrote of the Cigale  of the books, instead of interrogating the living Cigale, whose cymbals  were resounding on every side; careless of the real, he followed  tradition. He himself echoed a more ancient narrative; he repeated some  legend that had reached him from India, the venerable mother of  civilisations. We do not know precisely what story the reed-pen of the  Hindoo may have confided to writing, in order to show the perils of a  life without foresight; but it is probable that the little animal drama  was nearer the truth than the conversation between the Cigale and the  Ant. India, the friend of animals, was incapable of such a mistake.  Everything seems to suggest that the principal personage of the original  fable was not the Cigale of the Midi, but some other creature, an insect  if you will, whose manners corresponded to the adopted text.    Imported into Greece, after long centuries during which, on the banks of  the Indus, it made the wise reflect and the children laugh, the ancient  anecdote, perhaps as old as the first piece of advice that a father of a  family ever gave in respect of economy, transmitted more or less  faithfully from one memory to another, must have suffered alteration in  its details, as is the fate of all such legends, which the passage of  time adapts to the circumstance of time and place.    The Greek, not finding in his country the insect of which the Hindoo  spoke, introduced the Cigale, as in Paris, the modern Athens, the Cigale  has been replaced by the Grasshopper. The mistake was made; henceforth  indelible. Entrusted as it is to the memory of childhood, error will  prevail against the truth that lies before our eyes.    Let us seek to rehabilitate the songstress so calumniated by the fable.  She is, I grant you, an importunate neighbour. Every summer she takes up  her station in hundreds before my door, attracted thither by the verdure  of two great plane-trees; and there, from sunrise to sunset, she hammers  on my brain with her strident symphony. With this deafening concert  thought is impossible; the mind is in a whirl, is seized with vertigo,  unable to concentrate itself. If I have not profited by the early  morning hours the day is lost.    Ah! Creature possessed, the plague of my dwelling, which I hoped would  be so peaceful!--the Athenians, they say, used to hang you up in a  little cage, the better to enjoy your song. One were well enough, during  the drowsiness of digestion; but hundreds, roaring all at once,  assaulting the hearing until thought recoils--this indeed is torture!  You put forward, as excuse, your rights as the first occupant. Before my  arrival the two plane-trees were yours without reserve; it is I who have  intruded, have thrust myself into their shade. I confess it: yet muffle  your cymbals, moderate your arpeggi, for the sake of your historian! The  truth rejects what the fabulist tells us as an absurd invention. That  there are sometimes dealings between the Cigale and the Ant is perfectly  correct; but these dealings are the reverse of those described in the  fable. They depend not upon the initiative of the former; for the Cigale  never required the help of others in order to make her living: on the  contrary, they are due to the Ant, the greedy exploiter of others, who  fills her granaries with every edible she can find. At no time does the  Cigale plead starvation at the doors of the ant-hills, faithfully  promising a return of principal and interest; the Ant on the contrary,  harassed by drought, begs of the songstress. Begs, do I say! Borrowing  and repayment are no part of the manners of this land-pirate. She  exploits the Cigale; she impudently robs her. Let us consider this  theft; a curious point of history as yet unknown.    In July, during the stifling hours of the afternoon, when the insect  peoples, frantic with drought, wander hither and thither, vainly seeking  to quench their thirst at the faded, exhausted flowers, the Cigale makes  light of the general aridity. With her rostrum, a delicate augur, she  broaches a cask of her inexhaustible store. Crouching, always singing,  on the twig of a suitable shrub or bush, she perforates the firm, glossy  rind, distended by the sap which the sun has matured. Plunging her  proboscis into the bung-hole, she drinks deliciously, motionless, and  wrapt in meditation, abandoned to the charms of syrup and of song.    Let us watch her awhile. Perhaps we shall witness unlooked-for  wretchedness and want. For there are many thirsty creatures wandering  hither and thither; and at last they discover the Cigale's private well,  betrayed by the oozing sap upon the brink. They gather round it, at  first with a certain amount of constraint, confining themselves to  lapping the extravasated liquor. I have seen, crowding around the  honeyed perforation, wasps, flies, earwigs, Sphinx-moths, Pompilidae,  rose-chafers, and, above all, ants.    The smallest, in order to reach the well, slip under the belly of the  Cigale, who kindly raises herself on her claws, leaving room for the  importunate ones to pass. The larger, stamping with impatience, quickly  snatch a mouthful, withdraw, take a turn on the neighbouring twigs, and  then return, this time more enterprising. Envy grows keener; those who  but now were cautious become turbulent and aggressive, and would  willingly drive from the spring the well-sinker who has caused it to  flow.    In this crowd of brigands the most aggressive are the ants. I have seen  them nibbling the ends of the Cigale's claws; I have caught them tugging  the ends of her wings, climbing on her back, tickling her antennae. One  audacious individual so far forgot himself under my eyes as to seize her  proboscis, endeavouring to extract it from the well!    Thus hustled by these dwarfs, and at the end of her patience, the  giantess finally abandons the well. She flies away, throwing a jet of  liquid excrement over her tormentors as she goes. But what cares the Ant  for this expression of sovereign contempt? She is left in possession of  the spring--only too soon exhausted when the pump is removed that made  it flow. There is little left, but that little is sweet. So much to the  good; she can wait for another drink, attained in the same manner, as  soon as the occasion presents itself.    [Illustration: DURING THE DROUGHTS OF SUMMER THIRSTING INSECTS, AND  NOTABLY THE ANT, FLOCK TO THE DRINKING-PLACES OF THE CIGALE.]    As we see, reality completely reverses the action described by the  fable. The shameless beggar, who does not hesitate at theft, is the Ant;  the industrious worker, willingly sharing her goods with the suffering,  is the Cigale. Yet another detail, and the reversal of the fable is  further emphasised. After five or six weeks of gaiety, the songstress  falls from the tree, exhausted by the fever of life. The sun shrivels  her body; the feet of the passers-by crush it. A bandit always in search  of booty, the Ant discovers the remains. She divides the rich find,  dissects it, and cuts it up into tiny fragments, which go to swell her  stock of provisions. It is not uncommon to see a dying Cigale, whose  wings are still trembling in the dust, drawn and quartered by a gang of  knackers. Her body is black with them. After this instance of  cannibalism the truth of the relations between the two insects is  obvious.    Antiquity held the Cigale in high esteem. The Greek Beranger, Anacreon,  devoted an ode to her, in which his praise of her is singularly  exaggerated. \"Thou art almost like unto the Gods,\" he says. The reasons  which he has given for this apotheosis are none of the best. They  consist in these three privileges: [Greek: gegenes, apathes,  hanaimosarke]; born of the earth, insensible to pain, bloodless. We will  not reproach the poet for these mistakes; they were then generally  believed, and were perpetuated long afterwards, until the exploring eye  of scientific observation was directed upon them. And in minor poetry,  whose principal merit lies in rhythm and harmony, we must not look at  things too closely.    Even in our days, the Provencal poets, who know the Cigale as Anacreon  never did, are scarcely more careful of the truth in celebrating the  insect which they have taken for their emblem.
