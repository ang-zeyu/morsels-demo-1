These are the  very tales which Socrates cannot abide; and his dislike of them, as he  suspects, has branded him with the reputation of impiety. Here is one  answer to the question, 'Why Socrates was put to death,' suggested by  the way. Another is conveyed in the words, 'The Athenians do not care  about any man being thought wise until he begins to make other men wise;  and then for some reason or other they are angry:' which may be said to  be the rule of popular toleration in most other countries, and not at  Athens only. In the course of the argument Socrates remarks that the  controversial nature of morals and religion arises out of the difficulty  of verifying them. There is no measure or standard to which they can be  referred.    The next definition, 'Piety is that which is loved of the gods,' is  shipwrecked on a refined distinction between the state and the act,  corresponding respectively to the adjective (philon) and the participle  (philoumenon), or rather perhaps to the participle and the verb  (philoumenon and phileitai). The act is prior to the state (as in  Aristotle the energeia precedes the dunamis); and the state of being  loved is preceded by the act of being loved. But piety or holiness is  preceded by the act of being pious, not by the act of being loved; and  therefore piety and the state of being loved are different. Through such  subtleties of dialectic Socrates is working his way into a deeper region  of thought and feeling. He means to say that the words 'loved of the  gods' express an attribute only, and not the essence of piety.    Then follows the third and last definition, 'Piety is a part of  justice.' Thus far Socrates has proceeded in placing religion on a  moral foundation. He is seeking to realize the harmony of religion and  morality, which the great poets Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Pindar had  unconsciously anticipated, and which is the universal want of all men.  To this the soothsayer adds the ceremonial element, 'attending upon the  gods.' When further interrogated by Socrates as to the nature of  this 'attention to the gods,' he replies, that piety is an affair of  business, a science of giving and asking, and the like. Socrates points  out the anthropomorphism of these notions, (compare Symp.; Republic;  Politicus.) But when we expect him to go on and show that the true  service of the gods is the service of the spirit and the co-operation  with them in all things true and good, he stops short; this was a lesson  which the soothsayer could not have been made to understand, and which  every one must learn for himself.    There seem to be altogether three aims or interests in this little  Dialogue: (1) the dialectical development of the idea of piety; (2) the  antithesis of true and false religion, which is carried to a certain  extent only; (3) the defence of Socrates.    The subtle connection with the Apology and the Crito; the holding back  of the conclusion, as in the Charmides, Lysis, Laches, Protagoras, and  other Dialogues; the deep insight into the religious world; the dramatic  power and play of the two characters; the inimitable irony, are reasons  for believing that the Euthyphro is a genuine Platonic writing. The  spirit in which the popular representations of mythology are denounced  recalls Republic II. The virtue of piety has been already mentioned  as one of five in the Protagoras, but is not reckoned among the four  cardinal virtues of Republic IV. The figure of Daedalus has occurred in  the Meno; that of Proteus in the Euthydemus and Io. The kingly science  has already appeared in the Euthydemus, and will reappear in the  Republic and Statesman. But neither from these nor any other indications  of similarity or difference, and still less from arguments respecting  the suitableness of this little work to aid Socrates at the time of his  trial or the reverse, can any evidence of the date be obtained.          EUTHYPHRO      PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Socrates, Euthyphro.    SCENE: The Porch of the King Archon.      EUTHYPHRO: Why have you left the Lyceum, Socrates? and what are you  doing in the Porch of the King Archon? Surely you cannot be concerned in  a suit before the King, like myself?    SOCRATES: Not in a suit, Euthyphro; impeachment is the word which the  Athenians use.    EUTHYPHRO: What! I suppose that some one has been prosecuting you, for I  cannot believe that you are the prosecutor of another.    SOCRATES: Certainly not.    EUTHYPHRO: Then some one else has been prosecuting you?    SOCRATES: Yes.    EUTHYPHRO: And who is he?    SOCRATES: A young man who is little known, Euthyphro; and I hardly know  him: his name is Meletus, and he is of the deme of Pitthis. Perhaps you  may remember his appearance; he has a beak, and long straight hair, and  a beard which is ill grown.    EUTHYPHRO: No, I do not remember him, Socrates. But what is the charge  which he brings against you?    SOCRATES: What is the charge? Well, a very serious charge, which shows  a good deal of character in the young man, and for which he is certainly  not to be despised. He says he knows how the youth are corrupted and  who are their corruptors. I fancy that he must be a wise man, and seeing  that I am the reverse of a wise man, he has found me out, and is going  to accuse me of corrupting his young friends. And of this our mother the  state is to be the judge. Of all our political men he is the only one  who seems to me to begin in the right way, with the cultivation of  virtue in youth; like a good husbandman, he makes the young shoots his  first care, and clears away us who are the destroyers of them. This is  only the first step; he will afterwards attend to the elder branches;  and if he goes on as he has begun, he will be a very great public  benefactor.    EUTHYPHRO: I hope that he may; but I rather fear, Socrates, that the  opposite will turn out to be the truth. My opinion is that in attacking  you he is simply aiming a blow at the foundation of the state. But in  what way does he say that you corrupt the young?    SOCRATES: He brings a wonderful accusation against me, which at first  hearing excites surprise: he says that I am a poet or maker of gods, and  that I invent new gods and deny the existence of old ones; this is the  ground of his indictment.    EUTHYPHRO: I understand, Socrates; he means to attack you about the  familiar sign which occasionally, as you say, comes to you. He thinks  that you are a neologian, and he is going to have you up before the  court for this. He knows that such a charge is readily received by the  world, as I myself know too well; for when I speak in the assembly about  divine things, and foretell the future to them, they laugh at me and  think me a madman. Yet every word that I say is true. But they are  jealous of us all; and we must be brave and go at them.    SOCRATES: Their laughter, friend Euthyphro, is not a matter of much  consequence. For a man may be thought wise; but the Athenians, I  suspect, do not much trouble themselves about him until he begins to  impart his wisdom to others, and then for some reason or other, perhaps,  as you say, from jealousy, they are angry.    EUTHYPHRO: I am never likely to try their temper in this way.    SOCRATES: I dare say not, for you are reserved in your behaviour, and  seldom impart your wisdom. But I have a benevolent habit of pouring out  myself to everybody, and would even pay for a listener, and I am afraid  that the Athenians may think me too talkative. Now if, as I was saying,  they would only laugh at me, as you say that they laugh at you, the  time might pass gaily enough in the court; but perhaps they may be in  earnest, and then what the end will be you soothsayers only can predict.    EUTHYPHRO: I dare say that the affair will end in nothing, Socrates, and  that you will win your cause; and I think that I shall win my own.    SOCRATES: And what is your suit, Euthyphro? are you the pursuer or the  defendant?    EUTHYPHRO: I am the pursuer.    SOCRATES: Of whom?    EUTHYPHRO: You will think me mad when I tell you.    SOCRATES: Why, has the fugitive wings?    EUTHYPHRO: Nay, he is not very volatile at his time of life.    SOCRATES: Who is he?    EUTHYPHRO: My father.    SOCRATES: Your father! my good man?    EUTHYPHRO: Yes.    SOCRATES: And of what is he accused?    EUTHYPHRO: Of murder, Socrates.    SOCRATES: By the powers, Euthyphro! how little does the common herd know  of the nature of right and truth. A man must be an extraordinary man,  and have made great strides in wisdom, before he could have seen his way  to bring such an action.    EUTHYPHRO: Indeed, Socrates, he must.    SOCRATES: I suppose that the man whom your father murdered was one of  your relatives--clearly he was; for if he had been a stranger you would  never have thought of prosecuting him.    EUTHYPHRO: I am amused, Socrates, at your making a distinction between  one who is a relation and one who is not a relation; for surely the  pollution is the same in either case, if you knowingly associate with  the murderer when you ought to clear yourself and him by proceeding  against him. The real question is whether the murdered man has been  justly slain. If justly, then your duty is to let the matter alone; but  if unjustly, then even if the murderer lives under the same roof with  you and eats at the same table, proceed against him. Now the man who is  dead was a poor dependant of mine who worked for us as a field labourer  on our farm in Naxos, and one day in a fit of drunken passion he got  into a quarrel with one of our domestic servants and slew him. My father  bound him hand and foot and threw him into a ditch, and then sent to  Athens to ask of a diviner what he should do with him. Meanwhile he  never attended to him and took no care about him, for he regarded him as  a murderer;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16435"],[0,"The Atlantic Book of Modern Plays (#2)"],[1,"as well as plays; it is most powerful in  three or four novels by George Eliot, George Meredith, and Thomas  Hardy.    One of the best ways to understand these as real stage plays is  through some sort of dramatization. This does not mean, however,  that they need be produced with elaborate scenery and costumes,  memorizing, and rehearsal; often the best understanding may be  secured by quite informal reading in the class, with perhaps a hat  and cloak and a lath sword or two for properties. With simply a  clear space in the classroom for a stage, you and your  imaginations can give all the performance necessary for realizing  these plays very well indeed. But, of course, you must clearly  understand the lines and the play as a whole before you try to  take a part, so that you can read simply and naturally, as you  think the people in the story probably spoke. Some questions for  discussion in the appendix may help you in talking the plays over  in class or in reading them for yourself before you try to take a  part. You will find it sometimes helps, also, to make a diagram or  a colored sketch of the scene as the author describes it, or even  a small model of the stage for a \"dramatic museum\" for your  school. If you have not tried this, you do not know how much it  helps in seeing plays of other times, like Shakespeare's or  Moliere's; and it is useful also for modern dramas. Such small  stages can be used for puppet theatres as well. \"The Knave of  Hearts\" is intended as a marionette play, and other  dramas--Maeterlinck's and even Shakespeare's--have been given in  this way with very interesting effects.    If you bring these plays to a performance for others outside your  own class, you will find that the simplest and least pretentious  settings are generally most effective. The Irish players, as Mr.  Yeats tells us, \"have made scenery, indeed, but scenery that is  little more than a suggestion--a pattern with recurring boughs and  leaves of gold for a wood, a great green curtain, with a red  stencil upon it to carry the eye upward, for a palace.\" Mr. John  Merrill of the Francis Parker School describes the quite excellent  results secured with a dark curtain in a semicircle--a  cyclorama--for background, and with colored lights.[1] Such a  staging leaves the attention free to follow the lines, and the  imagination to picture whatever the play suggests as the place of  the action.

It consists of the  very usual \"two rooms, kitchen, and bath,\" a concealed bed in the  parlor and another in the kitchen enabling him to house his  family--consisting of himself, his wife, his little son, and his  aged father-in-law--therein. The kitchen-and-living-room is a  good-sized square room. The right wall (our right as we look at  it) is occupied by a huge built-in dresser, sink, and coal bunker,  the left wall by a high-manteled, ovened, and boilered fireplace,  the recess on either side of which contains a low painted  cupboard. Over the far cupboard hangs a picture of a ship, but  over the near one is a small square window. The far wall has two  large doors in it, that on the right leading to the lobby, and  that on the left appertaining to the old father-in-law's concealed  bed. The walls are distempered a brickish red. The ceiling once  was white. The floor is covered with bright linoleum and a couple  of rag rugs--one before the fire--a large one--and a smaller one  before the door of the concealed bed._    _A deal table is just to right of centre. A long flexible  gas-bracket depends from the ceiling above it. Another  many-jointed gas-bracket projects from the middle of the high  mantelpiece, its flame turned down towards the stove. There are  wooden chairs at the table, above, below, and to left of it. A  high-backed easy chair is above the fire, a kitchen elbow-chair  below it._    _The kitchen is very tidy. A newspaper newly fallen to the rug  before the fire and another--an evening one--spread flat on the  table are (besides a child's mug and plate, also on the table)  the only things not stowed in their prescribed places. It is  evening--the light beyond the little square window being the gray  dimness of a long Northern twilight which slowly deepens during  the play. When the curtain rises it is still light enough in the  room for a man to read if the print be not too faint and his eyes  be good. The warm light of the fire leaps and flickers through  the gray, showing up with exceptional clearness the deep-lined  face of old DAVID PIRNIE, who is discovered half-risen from his  armchair above the fire, standing on the hearth-rug, his body  bent and his hand on the chair arm. He is a little, feeble old  man with a well-shaped head and weather-beaten face, set off by a  grizzled beard and whiskers, wiry and vigorous, in curious  contrast to the wreath of snowy hair that encircles his head. His  upper lip is shaven. He wears an old suit--the unbuttoned  waistcoat of which shows an old flannel shirt. His slippers are  low at the heel and his socks loose at the ankles._    _The old man's eyes are fixed appealingly on those of his  daughter, who stands in the half-open door, her grasp on the  handle, meeting his look squarely--a straight-browed,  black-haired, determined young woman of six or seven and twenty.  Her husband_, JOHN, _seated at the table in his shirt-sleeves with  his head in his hands, reads hard at the paper and tries to look  unconcerned._      DAVID. Aw--but, Lizzie--    LIZZIE (_with splendid firmness_). It's nae use, feyther. I'm no'  gaein' to gie in to the wean. Ye've been tellin' yer stories to  him nicht after nicht for dear knows how long, and he's gettin'  to expect them.    DAVID. Why should he no' expect them?    LIZZIE. It disna do for weans to count on things so. He's layin'  up a sad disappointment for himself yin o' these days.    DAVID. He's gettin' a sad disappointment the noo. Och, come on,  Lizzie. I'm no' gaein' to dee just yet, an' ye can break him off  gradually when I begin to look like to.    LIZZIE. Who's talkin' o' yer deein', feyther?    DAVID. Ye were speakin' o' the disappointment he was layin' up  for himself if he got to count on me--    LIZZIE. I wasna thinkin' o' yer deein', feyther--only--it's no  guid for a bairn--    DAVID. Where's the harm in my giein' him a bit story before he  gangs tae his bed?    LIZZIE. I'm no sayin' there's ony harm in it this yinst, feyther;  but it's no richt to gae on nicht after nicht wi' never a break--    DAVID. Whit wey is it no richt if there's nae harm in it?    LIZZIE. It's giein' in to the wean.    DAVID. Whit wey should ye no' gie in to him if there's nae harm  in it?    LIZZIE (_keeping her patience with difficulty_). Because it gets  him into the habit.    DAVID. But why should he no' get into the habit if there's nae  harm in it?    (_John at the table chuckles. Lizzie gives him a look, but he  meets it not._)    LIZZIE. Really, feyther, ye micht be a wean yerself, ye're that  persistent.    DAVID. No, Lizzie, I'm no' persistent, I'm reasoning wi' ye. Ye  said there was nae harm in my tellin' him a bit story, an' now ye  say I'm not to because it'll get him into the habit; an' what I'm  askin' ye is, where's the harm o' his gettin' into the habit if  there's nae harm in it?    LIZZIE. Oh, aye; ye can be gey clever, twistin' the words in my  mouth, feyther; but richt is richt, an' wrang's wrang, for all  yer cleverness.    DAVID (_earnestly_). I'm no bein' clever ava, Lizzie,--no' the  noo,--I'm just tryin' to make ye see that, if ye admit there's  nae harm in a thing, ye canna say there's ony harm in it, an'  (_pathetically_) I'm wantin' to tell wee Alexander a bit story  before he gangs to his bed.    JOHN (_aside to her_). Och, wumman--    LIZZIE. T'ts, John; ye'd gie in tae onybody if they were just  persistent enough.    JOHN. He's an auld man.    LIZZIE (_really exasperated_). I ken fine he's an auld man, John,  and ye're a young yin, an' Alexander's gaein' to be anither, an'  I'm a lone wumman among the lot o' ye, but I'm no' gaein' to gie  in to--    JOHN (_bringing a fresh mind to bear upon the argument_). Efter a',  Lizzie, there's nae harm--    LIZZIE (_almost with a scream of anger_). Och, now you've stairted,  have you? Harm. Harm. Harm. You're talkin' about harm, and I'm  talking about richt an' wrang. You'd see your son grow up a  drunken keelie, an' mebbe a thief an' a murderer, so long as you  could say there was nae harm in it.    DAVID (_expostulating with some cause_). But I cudna say there was  nae harm in that, Lizzie, an' I wudna. Only when there's nae  harm--    LIZZIE. Och. (_Exits, calling off to the cause of the trouble._)  Are ye in yer bed yet, Alexander?    (_Shuts door with a click._)    DAVID (_standing on hearth-rug and shaking his head more in sorrow  than in anger_). She's no reasonable, ye ken, John; she disna  argue fair. I'm no complaining o' her mither, but it's a wee  thing hard that the only twa women I've known to be really chatty  an' argumentative with should ha' been just like that. An' me  that fond o' women's society.    (_He lowers himself into his chair._)    JOHN. They're all like it.    DAVID (_judiciously_). I wudna go sae far as to say that, John. Ye  see, I've only kent they twa to study carefully--an' it's no fair  to judge the whole sex by just the twa examples, an' it  were--(_Running on_) But it's gey hard, an' I was wantin' to tell  wee"]]]
