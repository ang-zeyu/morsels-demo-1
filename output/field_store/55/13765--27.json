Dr. Scouler's analogy between the Nootkan and \"Columbian,\" or Chinook, was  founded on the following words:    _English._           _Tlaoquatch and Nutka._   _Columbian._   plenty,              *aya,                     *haya.   no,                  *wik,                     *wake.   water,                tchaak,                   chuck.   good,                *hooleish,                *closh.   bad,                 *peishakeis,              *peshak.   man,                 *tchuckoop,                tillicham.   woman,               *tlootsemin,              *clootchamen.   child,               *tanassis,                *tanass.   now,                  tlahowieh,                clahowiah.   come,                *tchooqua,                *sacko.   slave,                mischemas,               *mischemas.   what are you doing   *akoots-ka-*mamook,        ekta-*mammok.   what are you saying  *au-kaak-*wawa,            ekta-*wawa.   let me see,          *nannanitch,              *nannanitch.   sun,                 *opeth,                    ootlach.   sky,                 *sieya,                   *saya.   fruit,               *chamas,                  *camas.   to sell,             *makok,                   *makok.   understand,          *commatax,                *commatax.    But of these, none marked with an asterisk belong to the Chinook or any of  its dialects. The greater part of them are undoubtedly Nootkan, though  there are errors in the spelling and, in some instances, in the meaning.  Of the rest, the Nootkan _tchaak_ and the Chinook _tl'tsuk_ alone presents  an analogy. _Klahowiah_ does not mean \"now,\" nor do I believe it is  Nootkan, in any sense. It is, as explained in the dictionary, the Chinook  salutation, \"How do you,\" \"Good-bye,\" and is supposed to be derived from  the word for _poor_, _miserable_. _Mischemas_ is not Chinook, and is  probably not Nootkan. With the exception of Franchere, whose short  vocabulary was published by Mr. Gallatin, and Mr. Hale, all the writers  mentioned by Ludwig who have given specimens of the Chinook language, have  presented it in its Jargon form, more or less mixed with the neighboring  ones, and with corruptions of French and English words. Mr. Swan, among  others, has been led into this error. The place of his residence,  Shoalwater Bay, is common ground of the Chinook and Chihalis Indians, and  the degraded remnants of the two tribes are closely intermarried, and use  both languages almost indifferently.    Setting aside interjections, common in a more or less modified form to  several adjoining tribes, twenty-one words of those given in this  vocabulary present noticeable analogies between the Chinook and other  native languages. They are as follows:    _English._         _Chinook._      _Hailtzuk and Belbella._   salmon berries,    klalilli,       olalli.      _English._       _Chinook and Clatsop._    _Nootka._                                             Jewitt and Cook.   water,           tl'tsuk : tl'chukw,       chauk : chahak.      _English._    _Chinook._    _Cowlitz._    _Kwantlen._    _Selish._   six,          takhum,       tukh'um,      tuckhum',      tackan.      _English._        _Chinook._    _Chihalis._    _Nisqually._   deep,             kellippe,     kluputl,       klep   glad,             kwan,                        kwal (_tame_)   proud,            eyutl,                       juil.   demon,            ichiatku,     tsiatko,       tsiatko.   black bear,       eitchhut,                    chetwut.   crow,             skaka,                       skaka.   oyster,           klokhklokh,   chetlokh,      klokhklokh.   game of \"hands,\"  itlokum,      setlokum.      _English._        _Chinook._    _Yakama and Klikatat._   certainly,        nawitka,      n'witka.   always,           kwanisum,     kwalisim.   younger sister,   ats,          atse.   road,             wehut,        wiet (_far_).   barrel,           tamtulitsh,   tamolitsh.   buffalo,          emusmus,      musmus.   coyote,           italipus,     talipa (_gray fox_).   mouse,            kholkhol,     khoilkhoil.   bread,            tsapelil,     saplil.   needle,           okwepowa,     kapus (_a pin_).    The Clatsop (Klatsop) is merely a dialect of the Chinook (Tchinuk); the  Cowlitz (Kaualitsk), Kwantlen, Chihalis (Tsihelis), and Nisqually  (N'skwali), are severally languages belonging to the Selish family. The  Yakama and Klikatat are dialects of one of the Sahaptin languages; and the  Tokwaht (Tokwat), Nittinat, and Makah (Maka), quoted in the dictionary,  are dialects of the Nootka (Nutka), of which the Hailtzuk or Belbella  (variously spelled Haeeltzuk and Hailtsa) is probably the northern type.  It thus appears that, with two or three exceptions, the analogies of the  Chinook, as contained in this vocabulary, are to be sought in the  immediately adjoining tongues, or those of languages belonging to the same  families with them; that these analogies, with perhaps one or two  exceptions, can by no means be considered radical, and that their  correspondence, or rather adoption, is easily accounted for by  neighborhood and habits of intermarriage. A much more remarkable  coincidence is the fact that two words included in this Jargon,--one from  the Nootkan, viz., _Mawitch_, a deer, venison; and the other Chinook,  _Mooluk_, an elk,--are also to be found in the Kowilth, the language of  Humboldt Bay, in California. As this bay was first discovered in the  winter of 1849-50, the words could not have been introduced by the fur  trappers.    With regard to the form into which this dictionary has been thrown, an  explanation is necessary. The Jargon must in some degree be regarded as a  written language, the orthography of which is English. In Mr. Hale's  vocabulary alone has one more scientific been attempted, and of several  other printed, and numerous manuscript dictionaries in circulation, M.  Lionnet's alone, that I have met with, is according to the French.  Although no fixed system of spelling exists among them, I have therefore  deemed it best to preserve for the Jargon words that which most distinctly  represents the common English pronunciation; while for the Indian  derivations, I have adopted that recommended by the Smithsonian  Institution in collecting Indian vocabularies, using the Italian sounds of  the vowels, and representing the guttural of the German _ich_ by _kh_.  This seemed the more proper, as the work would thereby be rendered of  practical use, independent of what philological value it may possess.    In collating the words of the present work and obtaining their  derivations, I have been assisted by a number of friends; among whom I  should specially mention Mr. Alexander C. Anderson, of Victoria, V.I., and  Mr. Solomon H. Smith, of Clatsop, Oregon.          ~Bibliography of the Chinook Jargon.~      _Journal of Travels over the Rocky Mountains._ By Rev.

He found him in his stateroom,  half crouched on the berth, apparently oblivious to the important  moment. It required a little effort to rouse Payson. He was a slight  boy, not over twenty-two, sallow-faced and freckled, with hair that  gave him the only name his comrades knew him by. Lane packed the boy's  few possessions and talked vehemently all the time. Red braced up,  ready to go, but he had little to say and that with the weary  nonchalance habitual with him. Lane helped him up on deck, and the  exertion, slight as it was, brought home to Lane that he needed help  himself. They found Maynard waiting.    \"Well, here we are--the Three Musketeers,\" said Lane, in a voice he  tried to make cheerful.    \"Where's the band?\" inquired Maynard, sardonically.    \"Gay old New York--and me broke!\" exclaimed Red Payson, as if to  himself.    Then the three stood by the rail, at the gangplank, waiting for the  hurried stream of passengers to disembark. Down on the wharf under the  glaring white lights, swarmed a crowd from which rose a babel of  voices. A whistle blew sharply at intervals. The whirr and honk of  taxicabs, and the jangle of trolley cars, sounded beyond the wide dark  portal of the dock-house. The murky water below splashed between ship  and pier. Deep voices rang out, and merry laughs, and shrill glad  cries of welcome. The bright light shone down upon a motley,  dark-garbed mass, moving slowly. The spirit of the occasion was  manifest.    When the three disabled soldiers, the last passengers to disembark,  slowly and laboriously descended to the wharf, no one offered to help  them, no one waited with a smile and hand-clasp of welcome. No one saw  them, except a burly policeman, who evidently had charge of the  traffic at the door. He poked his club into the ribs of the  one-legged, slowly shuffling Maynard and said with cheerful gruffness:  \"Step lively, Buddy, step lively!\"    Lane, with his two comrades, spent three days at a barracks-hospital  for soldiers in Bedford Park. It was a long flimsy structure, bare  except for rows of cots along each wall, and stoves at middle, and  each end. The place was overcrowded with disabled service men, all  worse off than Lane and his comrades. Lane felt that he really was  keeping a sicker man than himself from what attention the hospital  afforded. So he was glad, at the end of the third day, to find they  could be discharged from the army.    This enforced stay, when he knew he was on his way home, had seemed  almost unbearable to Lane. He felt that he had the strength to get  home, and that was about all. He began to expectorate blood--no  unusual thing for him--but this time to such extent that he feared the  return of hemorrhage. The nights seemed sleepless, burning, black  voids; and the days were hideous with noise and distraction. He wanted  to think about the fact that he was home--an astounding and  unbelievable thing. Once he went down to the city and walked on  Broadway and Fifth Avenue, taxing his endurance to the limit. But he  had become used to pain and exhaustion. So long as he could keep up he  did not mind.    That day three powerful impressions were forced upon Lane, never to be  effaced. First he found that the change in him was vast and  incalculable and vague. He could divine but not understand. Secondly,  the men of the service, disabled or not, were old stories to New  Yorkers. Lane saw soldiers begging from pedestrians. He muttered to  himself: \"By God, I'll starve to death before I ever do that!\" He  could not detect any aloofness on the part of passers-by. They were  just inattentive. Lane remembered with sudden shock how differently  soldiers had been regarded two or three years ago. He had read lengthy  newspaper accounts of the wild and magnificent welcome accorded to the  first soldiers to return to New York. How strange the contrast! But  that was long ago--past history--buried under the immense and hurried  and inscrutable changes of a nation. Lane divined that, as he felt the  mighty resistless throb of the great city. His third and strongest  impression concerned the women he met and passed on the streets. Their  lips and cheeks were rouged. Their dresses were cut too low at the  neck. But even this fashion was not nearly so striking as the short  skirts, cut off at the knees, and in many cases above. At first this  roused a strange amaze in Lane. \"What's the idea, I wonder?\" he mused.  But in the end it disgusted him. He reflected that for two swift years  he had been out of the track of events, away from centers of  population. Paris itself had held no attraction for him. Dreamer and  brooder, he had failed to see the material things. But this third  impression troubled him more than the other two and stirred thoughts  he tried to dispel. Returning to the barracks he learned that he and  his friends would be free on the morrow; and long into the night he  rejoiced in the knowledge. Free! The grinding, incomprehensible  Juggernaut and himself were at the parting of the ways. Before he went  to sleep he remembered a forgotten prayer his mother had taught him.  His ordeal was over. What had happened did not matter. The Hell was  past and he must bury memory. Whether or not he had a month or a year  to live it must be lived without memories of his ordeal.    Next day, at the railroad station, even at the moment of departure,  Lane and Blair Maynard had their problem with Red Payson. He did not  want to go to Blair's home.    \"But hell, Red, you haven't any home--any place to go,\" blurted out  Maynard.    So they argued with him, and implored him, and reasoned with him.  Since his discharge from the hospital in France Payson had always been  cool, weary, abstracted, difficult to reach. And here at the last he  grew strangely aloof and stubborn. Every word that bore relation to  his own welfare seemed only to alienate him the more. Lane sensed  this.    \"See here, Red,\" he said, \"hasn't it occurred to you that Blair and I  need you?\"    \"Need me? What!\" he exclaimed, with perceptible change of tone, though  it was incredulous.    \"Sure,\" interposed Blair.    \"Red--listen,\" continued Lane, speaking low and with difficulty.  \"Blair and I have been through the--the whole show together.... And  we've been in the hospitals with you for months.... We've all  got--sort of to rely on each other.... Let's stick it out to the end.  I guess--you know--we may not have a long time....\"    Lane's voice trailed off. Then the stony face of the listener changed  for a fleeting second.    \"Boys, I'll go over with you,\" he said.    And then the maimed Blair, awkward with his crutch and bag, insisted  on helping Lane get Red aboard the train. Red could just about walk.  Sombrely they clambered up the steps into the Pullman.    Middleville was a prosperous and thriving inland town of twenty  thousand inhabitants, identical with many towns of about the same size  in the middle and eastern United States.    Lane had been born there and had lived there all his life, seldom  having been away up to the advent of the war. So that the memories of  home and town and place, which he carried away from America with him,  had never had any chance, up to the time of his departure, to change  from the vivid, exaggerated image of boyhood. Since he had left  Middleville he had seen great cities, palaces, castles, edifices, he  had crossed great rivers, he had traveled thousands of miles, he had  looked down some of the famous thoroughfares of the world.    Was this then the reason that Middleville, upon his arrival, seemed  so strange, sordid, shrunken, so vastly changed? He stared, even while  he helped Payson off the train--stared at the little brick station at  once so familiar and yet so strange, that had held a place of dignity  in the picture of his memory. The moment was one of shock.    Then he was distracted from his pondering by tearful and joyful cries,  and deeper voices of men. He looked up to recognize Blair's mother,  father, sister; and men and women whose faces appeared familiar, but  whose names he could not recall. His acute faculty of perception took  quick note of a change in Blair's mother. Lane turned his gaze away.  The agony of joy and sorrow--the light of her face--was more than Lane  could stand. He looked at the sister Margaret--a tall, fair girl. She  had paint on her cheeks. She did not see Lane. Her strained gaze held  a beautiful and piercing intentness. Then her eyes opened wide, her  hand went to cover her mouth, and she cried out: \"Oh Blair!--poor boy!  Brother!\"    Only Lane heard her. The others were crying out themselves as Blair's  gray-haired mother received him into her arms. She seemed a proud  woman, broken and unsteady. Red Payson's grip on Lane's arm told what  that scene meant to him. How pitiful the vain effort of Blair's people  to hide their horror! Presently mother and sister and women relatives  fell aside to let the soldier boy meet his father. This was something  that rang the bells in Lane's heart. Men were different, and Blair  faced his father differently. The wild boy had come home--the  scapegoat of many Middleville escapades had returned--the  ne'er-do-well sought his father's house. He had come home to die. It  was there in Blair's white face--the dreadful truth. He wore a ribbon  on his breast and he leaned on a crutch. For the instant, as father  and son faced each other, there was something in Blair's poise, his  look of an eagle, that carried home a poignant sense of his greatness.  Lane thrilled with it and a lump constricted his throat. Then with  Blair's ringing \"Dad!\" and the father's deep and broken: \"My son! My  son!\" the two embraced.    In a stifling moment more it seemed, attention turned on Red Payson,  who stood nearest. Blair's folk were eager, kind, soft-spoken and warm  in their "]]]
