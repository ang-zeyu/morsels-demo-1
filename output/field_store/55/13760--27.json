This motion apparently changes the eternally stable stars into a  moving panorama, but it is only so in appearance. The sky is a  vast, immovable dial-plate of \"that clock whose pendulum ticks  ages instead of seconds,\" and whose time is eternity. The moon  moves among the illuminated figures, traversing the dial quickly,  like a second-hand, once a month. The sun, like a minute-hand, goes  over the dial once a year. Various planets stand for hour-hands,  moving over the dial in various periods reaching up to one hundred  and sixty-four years; while the earth, like a ship of exploration,  sails the infinite azure, bearing the observers to different points  where they may investigate the infinite problems of this mighty  machinery.    This dial not only shows present movements, but it keeps the history  of uncounted ages past ready to be [Page 4] read backward in proper  order; and it has glorious volumes of prophecy, revealing the  far-off future to any man who is able to look thereon, break the  seals, and read the record. Glowing stars are the alphabet of this  lofty page. They combine to form words. Meteors, rainbows, auroras,  shifting groups of stars, make pictures vast and significant as the  armies, angels, and falling stars in the Revelation of St.  John--changing and progressive pictures of infinite wisdom and  power.    Men have not yet advanced as far as those who saw the pictures John  describes, and hence the panorama is not understood. That continuous  speech that day after day uttereth is not heard; the knowledge that  night after night showeth is not seen; and the invisible things  of God from the creation of the world, even his eternal power and  Godhead, clearly discoverable from things that are made, are not  apprehended.    The greatest triumphs of men's minds have been in astronomy--and  ever must be. We have not learned its alphabet yet. We read only  easy lessons, with as many mistakes as happy guesses. But in time we  shall know all the letters, become familiar with the combinations,  be apt at their interpretation, and will read with facility the  lessons of wisdom and power that are written on the earth, blazoned  in the skies, and pictured by the flowers below and the rainbows  above.    In order to know how worlds move and develop, we must create them;  we must go back to their beginning, give their endowment of forces,  and study the laws of their unfolding. This we can easily do by that  faculty wherein man is likest his Father, a creative imagination.  God creates and embodies; we create, but [Page 5] it remains in  thought only. But the creation is as bright, strong, clear,  enduring, and real, as if it were embodied. Every one of us would  make worlds enough to crush us, if we could embody as well as  create. Our ambition would outrun our wisdom. Let us come into the  high and ecstatic frame of mind which Shakspeare calls frenzy, in  the exigencies of his verse, when     \"The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,    Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;    And, as imagination bodies forth    The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen    Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing    A local habitation and a name.\"    In the supremacy of our creative imagination let us make empty  space, in order that we may therein build up a new universe. Let us  wave the wand of our power, so that all created things disappear.  There is no world under our feet, no radiant clouds, no blazing  sun, no silver moon, nor twinkling stars. We look up, there is  no light; down, through immeasurable abysses, there is no form;  all about, and there is no sound or sign of being--nothing save  utter silence, utter darkness. It cannot be endured. Creation is  a necessity of mind--even of the Divine mind.    We will now, by imagination, create a monster world, every atom  of which shall be dowered with the single power of attraction.  Every particle shall reach out its friendly hand, and there shall  be a drawing together of every particle in existence. The laws  governing this attraction shall be two. When these particles are  associated together, the attraction shall be in proportion to the  mass. A given mass will pull twice [Page 6] as much as one of half  the size, because there is twice as much to pull. And a given mass  will be pulled twice as much as one half as large, because there is  twice as much to be pulled. A man who weighed one hundred and fifty  pounds on the earth might weigh a ton and a half on a body as large  as the sun. That shall be one law of attraction; and the other shall  be that masses attract inversely as the square of distances between  them. Absence shall affect friendships that have a material basis.  If a body like the earth pulls a man one hundred and fifty pounds at  the surface, or four thousand miles from the centre, it will pull  the same man one-fourth as much at twice the distance, one-sixteenth  as much at four times the distance. That is, he will weigh by a  spring balance thirty-seven and a half pounds at eight thousand  miles from the centre, and nine pounds six ounces at sixteen  thousand miles from the centre, and he will weigh or be pulled by  the earth 1/24 of a pound at the distance of the moon. But the moon  would be large enough and near enough to pull twenty-four pounds on  the same man, so the earth could not draw him away. Thus the two  laws of attraction of gravitation are--1, _Gravity is proportioned  to the quantity of matter_; and 2, _The force of gravity varies  inversely as the square of the distance from the centre of the  attracting body_.    The original form of matter is gas. Almost as I write comes the  announcement that Mr. Lockyer has proved that all the so-called  primary elements of matter are only so many different sized molecules  of one original substance--hydrogen. Whether that is true or not,  let us now create all the hydrogen we can [Page 7] imagine, either  in differently sized masses or in combination with other substances.  There it is! We cannot measure its bulk; we cannot fly around it in  any recordable eons of time. It has boundaries, to be sure, for we  are finite, but we cannot measure them. Let it alone, now; leave it  to itself. What follows? It is dowered simply with attraction. The  vast mass begins to shrink, the outer portions are drawn inward.  They rush and swirl in vast cyclones, thousands of miles in extent.  The centre grows compact, heat is evolved by impact, as will be  explained in Chapter II. Dull red light begins to look like coming  dawn. Centuries go by; contraction goes on; light blazes in  insufferable brightness; tornadoes, whirlpools, and tempests  scarcely signify anything as applied to such tumultuous tossing.    There hangs the only world in existence; it hangs in empty space.  It has no tendency to rise; none to fall; none to move at all in  any direction. It seethes and, flames, and holds itself together  by attractive power, and that is all the force with which we have  endowed it.    Leave it there alone, and withdraw millions of miles into space:  it looks smaller and smaller. We lose sight of those distinctive  spires of flame, those terrible movements. It only gives an even  effulgence, a steady unflickering light. Turn one quarter round.  Still we see our world, but it is at one side.    Now in front, in the utter darkness, suddenly create another world  of the same size, and at the same distance from you. There they  stand--two huge, lone bodies, in empty space. But we created them  dowered with attraction. Each instantly feels the drawing influence  of the other. They are mutually attractive, and begin to [Page 8]  move toward each other. They hasten along an undeviating straight  line. Their speed quickens at every mile. The attraction increases  every moment. They fly swift as thought. They dash their flaming,  seething foreheads together.    And now we have one world again. It is twice as large as before,  that is all the difference. There is no variety, neither any motion;  just simple flame, and nothing to be warmed thereby. Are our creative  powers exhausted by this effort?    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Orbit A D, resulting from attraction, A  C, and projectile force, A B.]    No, we will create another world, and add another power to it that  shall keep them apart. That power shall be what is called the force  of inertia, which is literally no power at all; it is an inability  to originate or change motion. If a body is at rest, inertia is  that quality by which it will forever remain so, unless acted upon  by some force from without; and if a body is in motion, it will  continue on at the same speed, in a straight line, forever, unless  it is quickened, retarded, or turned from its path by some other  force. Suppose our newly created sun is 860,000 miles in diameter.  Go away 92,500,000 miles and create an earth eight thousand miles  in diameter. It instantly feels the attractive power of the sun  drawing it to itself sixty-eight [Page 9] miles a second. Now, just  as it starts, give this earth a push in a line at right angles with  line of fall to the sun, that shall send it one hundred and  eighty-nine miles a second. It obeys both forces. The result is that  the world moves constantly forward at the same speed by its inertia  from that first push, and attraction momentarily draws it from its  straight line, so that the new world circles round the other to the  starting-point. Continuing under the operation of both forces, the  worlds can never come together or fly apart.    They circle about each other as long as these forces endure; for  the first world does not stand still and the second do all the  going; both revolve around the centre of gravity common to both.  In case the worlds are equal in mass, they will both take the same  orbit around a central stationary point, midway between the two.  In case their mass be as one to eighty-one, as in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15622"],[0,"Handbook on Japanning: 2nd Edition (#2)"],[1," which it is applied. But in particular work  glovers' or parchment size instead of common size is used, and this is  still further improved by the addition of one-third of isinglass, and  if the coat be not applied too thickly it will be much less liable to  peel or crack. The surface should be previously prepared for this  priming by being well cleaned and by being brushed over with hot size  diluted with two-thirds of water, that is provided the size be of the  usual strength. The priming is then evenly and uniformly applied with  a brush and left to dry. On a fairly even surface two coats of priming  properly applied should suffice. But if it will not take a proper  water polish, owing to the uneven surface not being effectually filled  up, one or more additional coats must be applied. Previous to the last  coat being applied, the surface should be smoothed by fine glass  paper. When the last coat of priming is dry the water polish is  applied. This is done by passing a fine wet rag or moistened sponge  over the surface until the whole appears uniformly smooth and even.  The priming is now complete and the surface ready to take the japan  ground or the coloured varnish.      THE FIRST STAGE IN THE JAPANNING OF WOOD OR OF LEATHER WITHOUT A  PRIMING.    [The leather is first securely stretched on a frame or board.] In this  case, that is when no priming coat is previously applied, the best way  to prepare the surface is to apply three coats of coarse varnish (1  lb. seed-lac, 1 lb rosin to 1 gallon methylated spirit, dissolve and  filter). This varnish, like all others formed from methylated spirits,  must be applied in a warm place and all dampness should be avoided,  for either cold or moisture chills it and thus prevents it taking  proper hold of the surface on which it is applied. When the work is  prepared thus, or by the priming made of size and whiting already  described, the japan proper is itself applied.          SECTION II.    JAPAN GROUNDS.      The japan ground properly so called consists of the varnish and  pigment where the whole surface is to be of one simple colour, or of  the varnish, with or without pigment, on which some painting or other  form of decoration is afterwards to be applied. It is best to form  this ground with the desired pigment incorporated with shellac  varnish, except in the case of a white japan ground which requires  special treatment, or when great brilliancy is a desideratum and other  methods must be adopted. The shellac varnish for the japan ground is  best prepared as follows: shellac 1-1/4 lb., methylated spirits 1  gallon. Dissolve in a well-corked vessel in a warm place and with  frequent shaking. After two or three days the shellac will be  dissolved. It is then recommended to filter the solution through a  flannel bag, and when all that will come through freely has done so  the varnish should be run into a proper sized vessel and kept  carefully corked for use. The bag may then be squeezed with the hand  till the remainder of the fluid varnish is forced through it, and this  if fairly clear may be used for rough purposes or added to the next  batch. Pigments of any nature whatever may be used with the shellac  varnish to give the desired tint to the ground, and where necessary  they may be mixed together to form any compound colour, such as blue  and yellow to form green. The pigments used for japan grounds should  all be previously ground very smooth in spirits of turpentine, so  smooth that the paste does not grate between the two thumb nails, and  then only are they mixed with the varnish. This mixture of pigment and  varnish vehicle should then be spread over the surface to be japanned  very carefully and very evenly with a camel-hair brush. As metals do  not require a priming coat of size and whiting, the japan ground may  be applied to metallic surfaces forthwith without any preliminary  treatment except thorough cleansing, except in the cases specially  referred to further on. On metallic surfaces three to four coats are  applied, and in the interval between each coat the articles must be  stoved in an oven heated to from 250 deg. to 300 deg. F.      WHITE JAPAN GROUNDS.    The formation of a perfectly white japan ground and of the first  degree of hardness has always been difficult to attain in the art of  japanning, as there are few or no substances that can be so dissolved  as to form a very hard varnish coat without being so darkened in the  process as to quite degrade or spoil the whiteness of the colour. The  following process, however, is said to give a composition which yields  a very near approach to a perfect white ground: Take flake white or  white lead washed and ground up with the sixth of its weight of starch  and then dried, temper it properly for spreading with mastic varnish  made thus: Take 5 oz. of mastic in powder and put it into a proper  vessel with 1 lb. of spirits of turpentine; let them boil at a gentle  heat till the mastic be dissolved, and, if there appear to be any  turbidity, strain off the solution through flannel. Apply this  intimate and homogeneous mixture on the body to be japanned, the  surface of which has been suitably prepared either with or without the  priming, then varnish it over with five or six coats of the following  varnish: Provide any quantity of the best seed-lac and pick out of it  all the clearest and whitest grains, take of this seed-lac 1/2 lb. and  of gum anime 3/4 lb., pulverize the mixture to a coarse powder and  dissolve in a gallon of methylated spirits and strain off the clear  varnish. The seed-lac will give a slight tint to this varnish, but it  cannot be omitted where the japanned surface must be hard, though  where a softer surface will serve the purpose the proportion of  seed-lac may be diminished and a little turpentine oleo-resin added to  the gum anime to take off the brittleness. A very good varnish  entirely free from brittleness may, it is said, be formed by  dissolving gum anime in old nut or poppy oil, which must be made to  boil gently when the gum is put into it. After being diluted with  turps the white ground may be applied in this varnish, and then a coat  or two of the varnish itself may be applied over it. These coats,  however, take a long time to dry, and, owing to its softer nature,  this japanned surface is more readily injured than that yielded by the  shellac varnish.    According to Mr. Dickson, \"the old way of making a cream enamel for  stoving (a white was supposed to be impossible) was to mix ordinary  tub white lead with the polishing copal varnish and to add a modicum  of blue to neutralize the yellow tinge, stove same in about 170 deg.F. and  then polish as before described\". \"This,\" continues Mr. Dickson,  \"would at the best produce but a very pale blue enamel or a cream. It  was afterwards made with flake white or dry white lead ground in turps  only and mixed with the polishing copal varnish with the addition of  tints as required, by which means a white of any required character  could be produced.\"      BLUE JAPAN GROUNDS.    Authorities state that these may be formed from bright Prussian blue  or verditer glazed over with Prussian blue or of smalt. By bright  Prussian blue possibly a genuine Prussian blue toned down to a sky  blue with white lead is meant, and by verditer the variety known as  refiners' blue verditer, and as to smalt it must not be forgotten that  it changes its colour in artificial light. Be that as it may, the  pigment may be mixed with the shellac varnish according to the  instructions already given, but as the shellac will somewhat injure  the tone of the pigment by imparting a yellow tinge to it where a  bright true blue is required, the directions already given as regards  white grounds must be carried out.      SCARLET JAPAN GROUND.    Vermilion is the best pigment to use for a scarlet japan ground, and  its effect will be greatly enhanced by glazing it over with carmine or  fine lake. If, however, the highest degree of brightness be required  the white varnish must be used. Vermilion must be stoved at a very  gentle heat.      RED JAPAN GROUND.    The basis of this japan ground is made up with madder lake ground in  oil of turpentine, this constitutes the first ground; when this is  perfectly dry a second coat of lake and white in copal varnish is  applied, and the last coat is made up of lake in a mixture of copal  varnish and turpentine varnish.      BRIGHT PALE YELLOW GROUNDS.    Orpiment or King's yellow may be used, and the effect is enhanced by  dissolving powdered turmeric root in the methylated spirits from which  the upper or polishing coat is made, which methylated spirits must be  strained from off the dregs before the seed-lac is added to it to form  the varnish. The seed-lac varnish is not so injurious to yellow  pigments as it is to the tone of some other pigments, because, being  tinged a reddish yellow, it does little more than intensify or deepen  the tone of the pigment.      GREEN JAPAN GROUNDS.    Green japan grounds are produced by mixing Prussian blue or distilled  verdigris with orpiment, and the effect is said to be extremely  brilliant by applying them on a ground of leaf gold. Any of them may  be used with good seed-lac varnish, for reasons already given. Equal  parts by weight of rosin, precipitated rosinate of copper, and  coal-tar solvent naphtha will give a varnish which, when suitably  thinned and the coats stoved at a heat below 212 deg. F., will give a  green japan second to none as a finishing coat as regards purity of  tone at least. To harden it and render it more elastic half of the  rosin might be replaced by equal weights of a copal soluble in solvent  naphtha and boiled linseed oil, so that the mixture would stand thus:  rosinate of copper 1 lb., rosin 1/2 lb., boiled oil 1/4 lb., hard  resin (copal) 1/4 lb., solvent naphtha 1 lb. When heated to a high  temperature this rosinate of copper"]]]
