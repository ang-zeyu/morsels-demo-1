Chopin's letters contain unmistakable evidence of the fact that, with  some exceptions, the Germans did not understand his compositions. At  his first concert in Vienna, he writes, \"The first allegro in the F  minor concerto (not intelligible to all) was indeed rewarded with  'Bravo!' but I believe this was rather because the audience wished to  show that they appreciated serious music than because they were able  to follow and appreciate such music.\" And regarding the fantasia on  Polish airs he says that it completely missed its mark: \"There was  indeed some applause by the audience, but obviously only to show the  pianist that they were not bored.\" The ultra-Germans, he writes in  another letter, did not appear to be quite satisfied; and he relates  that one of these, on being asked, in his presence, how he liked the  concert, at once changed the subject of conversation, obviously in  order not to hurt his feelings. In a third letter, in which he gives  his parents an account of his concert in Breslau, in 1830, he says  that, \"With the exception of Schnabel, whose face was beaming with  pleasure, and who patted me on the shoulder every other moment, none  of the other Germans knew exactly what to make of me;\" and he adds,  with his delicious irony, that \"the connoisseurs could not exactly  make out whether my compositions really were good or only seemed so.\"    Criticisms culled from contemporary newspaper notices and other  sources emphasize the fact that the Germans were at that time blind to  the transcendent merits of Chopin's genius. The professional critics,  after their usual manner, found fault with the very things which we  to-day admire most in him--the exotic originality of the style, and  the delightful Polish local color in which all his fabrics are \"dyed  in the wool,\" as it were. How numerous these adverse criticisms were,  may best be inferred from the frequency with which Schumann defended  Chopin in his musical paper and sneered at his detractors. \"It is  remarkable,\" he writes, \"that in the very droughty years preceding  1830, in which one should have thanked Heaven for every straw of  superior quality, criticism, which it is true, _always lags behind  unless it emanates from creative minds_, persisted in shrugging its  shoulders at Chopin's compositions--nay, that one of them had the  impudence to say that all they were good for was to be torn to  pieces.\" In another article, after speaking in the most enthusiastic  terms of Chopin's trio, in which \"every note is music and life,\" he  exclaims, \"Wretched Berlin critic, who has no understanding for these  things, and never will have--poor fellow!\" And seven years later, in  1843, he writes, with fine contempt for his critical colleagues, that  \"for the typical reviewers Chopin never did write, anyway.\" And this,  be it remembered, was only six years before Chopin's death.    Not a few of the composers and composerlings of the period joined the  professional critics in their depreciation of Chopin's works. Field  called his \"a talent of the sick chamber.\" Moscheles, while admitting  Chopin's originality, and the value of his pianistic achievements,  confessed that he disliked his \"harsh, inartistic, incomprehensible  modulations,\" which often appeared \"artificial and forced\" to  him--these same modulations which to-day transport us into the seventh  heaven of delight! Mendelssohn's attitude toward Chopin was somewhat  vacillating. He defended him in a letter against his sister's  criticisms, and assured her that if she had heard some of Chopin's  compositions \"as he himself played them\" for him, she too would have  been delighted. He adds that Chopin had just completed \"a most  graceful little nocturne,\" of which he remembered much, and was going  to play it for his brother Paul. Nevertheless, he did not recommend  the pupils at the Leipsic Conservatory to study Chopin's works, and  various utterances of his are on record showing that he had a decided  artistic antipathy for the exotic products of Chopin's pen. To give  only one instance. In one of the letters to Moscheles, first printed  in _Scribner's Magazine_ for February, 1888, he complains that \"a book  of mazurkas by Chopin, and a few new pieces of his are so mannered  that they are hard to stand.\"    I have dwelt so much on the attitude of the Germans toward Chopin,  because I am convinced that in this attitude lies one of the main  reasons why no one has hitherto dared to place him in the front rank  of composers, side by side with Bach, Beethoven, and Wagner. For the  Germans are the _tonangebende_ (the standard-setting) nation in music  to-day, and, as there seems to be a natural antipathy between the  Slavic and the Teutonic mind, the Germans are apt, like Mendelssohn,  to regard as mannerism what is simply the exotic fragrance which  betrays a foreign nationality. The ultro-Teutons still persist in  their depreciation of Chopin. In the latest edition of Brockhaus's  \"Conservations-Lexicon\" we read, apropos to Chopin's larger works,  that \"he was deficient in the profounder musical attainments\"(!) Dr.  Hanslick, generally considered the leading German critic of the  period, in a 534-page collection of criticisms, discussing twenty  concert seasons in Vienna, has only about half a dozen and by no  means complimentary references to Chopin. And even the late Louis  Ehlert, in his appreciative essay on Chopin, comes to the conclusion  that Chopin is certainly not to be ranked with such giants as Bach and  Beethoven. This is Teutonism, pure and simple. No doubt Chopin is, in  some respects, inferior to Bach and Beethoven, but in other respects  he is quite as unquestionably superior to them. He wrote no mammoth  symphonies, but there is a marvellous wealth and depth of ideas in his  smaller works--enough to supply half a dozen ordinary symphony and  opera writers with ideas for a lifetime. His works may be compared to  those men of genius in whose under-sized bodies dwelt a gigantic mind.    Schumann appears to have been the only contemporary composer who did  not underrate Chopin. Whether he would have gone so far as to rank him  with the greatest of the German composers, I cannot say, for he avoids  direct comparisons. But if imitation is the sincerest form of  flattery, then Schumann flattered Chopin more than any other master,  for his pianoforte works are much more in the manner of Chopin than of  Bach or Beethoven. I do not mean direct imitation, but that  unconscious adoption of Chopin's numerous innovations in the treatment  of the piano and of musical style, which are better evidence of  influence than the borrowing of an idea or two. He himself testified  to the \"intimate artistic relations\" between him and Chopin.  Moreover, his praise of Chopin is always pitched in such a high key  that it would seem as if praise could no higher go. It was he who  first proclaimed Chopin's genius authoritatively, and to this fact he  often referred subsequently, with special pride. The very first  article in his volumes of criticisms is devoted to Chopin's variations  on \"La Ci Darem',\" published as \"opus 2.\" In those days, Schumann used  to give his criticisms a semi-dramatic form. On this occasion he  represents his _alter ego_, Eusebius, as rushing into the room with a  new composition, and the exclamation \"Hats off, gentlemen! a genius!\"  He then analyzes the variations in glowing poetic language and  rapturously exclaims at the end that \"there is genius in every bar.\"  And this was only one of the _early_ works of Chopin, in which he has  by no means attained his full powers. Of another quite early work, the  second concerto, he writes that it is a composition \"which none of us  can approach except it be with the lips to kiss the hem;\" and later  on, the Preludes, the most inspired of his works, led Schumann to  exclaim that Chopin \"is and remains the boldest and noblest artistic  spirit of the time.\"    Schumann would have found it difficult to induce any of his countrymen  to endorse his exalted opinion of Chopin, but the Hungarian Liszt  joined hands with him heartily, and pronounced Chopin \"an artist of  the first rank.\" \"His best works,\" he says, \"contain numerous  combinations of which it must be said that they did nothing less than  create an epoch in the treatment of musical style. Bold, brilliant,  enchanting, his pieces _conceal their depth behind so much grace,  their erudition behind so much charm_, that it is difficult to  emancipate one's self from their overpowering magic and estimate them  according to their theoretic value. This fact is already recognized by  some competent judges, and it will be more and more generally realized  when the progress made in art during the Chopin epoch is carefully  studied.\"    That Elsner, Chopin's teacher, detected his pupil's originality, has  already been stated. Fortunately he allowed it a free rein instead of  trying to check and crush it, as teachers are in the habit of doing.  But there are some passages in Chopin's early letters which seem to  indicate that the general public and the professional musicians in his  native Poland were not so very much in advance of the Germans in  recognizing his musical genius. Liszt doubts whether Chopin's national  compositions were as fully appreciated by his countrymen as the work  of native poets; and Chopin writes to a friend, apropos of his second  concert at Warsaw: \"The _elite_ of the musical world will be there;  but I have little confidence in their musical judgment--Elsner of  course excepted.\" Elsewhere he complains of a patriotic admirer who  had written that the Poles would some day be as proud of Chopin as the  Germans were of Mozart. And when in addition to this the editor of a  local paper told him he had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18564"],[0,"The Religion of Ancient Rome (#2)"],[1,"too in this connection the worship of springs, summed up in  the subsequent deity Fons, and of rivers, such as Volturnus, the  cult-name of the Tiber.    =3. Worship of Trees.=--But most conspicuous among the cults of natural  objects, as in so many primitive religions, is the worship of trees.  Here, though doubtless at first the tree was itself the object of  veneration, surviving instances seem rather to belong to the later  period when it was regarded as the abode of the spirit. We may  recognise a case of this sort in the _ficus Ruminalis_, once the  recipient of worship, though later legend, which preferred to find an  historical or mythical explanation of cults, looked upon it as sacred  because it was the scene of the suckling of Romulus and Remus by the  wolf. Another fig-tree with a similar history is the _caprificus_ of  the Campus Martius, subsequently the site of the worship of Iuno  Caprotina. A more significant case is the sacred oak of Iuppiter  Feretrius on the Capitol, on which the _spolia opima_ were hung after  the triumph--probably in early times a dedication of the booty to the  spirit inhabiting the tree. Outside Rome, showing the same ideas at  work among neighbouring peoples, was the 'golden bough' in the grove of  Diana at Aricia. Nor was it only special trees which were thus regarded  as the home of a deity; the tree in general is sacred, and any one may  chance to be inhabited by a spirit. The feeling of the country  population on this point comes out clearly in the prayer which Cato  recommends his farmer to use before making a clearing in a wood: 'Be  thou god or goddess, to whom this grove is sacred, be it granted to us  to make propitiatory sacrifice to thee with a pig for the clearing of  this sacred spot'; here we have a clear instance of the tree regarded  as the dwelling of the sacred power, and it is interesting to compare  the many similar examples which[2] Dr. Frazer has collected from  different parts of the world.    =4. Worship of Animals.=--Of the worship of animals we have  comparatively little evidence in Roman religion, though we may perhaps  detect it in a portion of the mysterious ritual of the Lupercalia,  where the Luperci dressed themselves in the skins of the sacrificed  goats and smeared their faces with the blood, thus symbolically trying  to bring themselves into communion with the sacred animal. We may  recognise it too in the association of particular animals with  divinities, such as the sacred wolf and woodpecker of Mars, but on the  whole we may doubt whether the worship of animals ever played so  prominent a part in Roman religion as the cult of other natural  objects.    =5. Animism.=--Such are some of the survivals of very early stages of  religious custom which still kept their place in the developed religion  of Rome, but by far the most important element in it, which might  indeed be described as its 'immediate antecedent,' is the state of  religious feeling to which anthropologists have given the name of  'Animism.' As far as we can follow the development of early religions,  this attitude of mind seems to be the direct outcome of the failure of  magic. Primitive man begins to see that neither he nor his magicians  really possess that occult control over the forces of nature which was  the supposed basis of magic: the charm fails, the spell does not  produce the rain and when he looks for the cause, he can only argue  that these things must be in the hands of some power higher than his  own. The world then and its various familiar objects become for him  peopled with spirits, like in character to men, but more powerful, and  his success in life and its various operations depends on the degree in  which he is able to propitiate these spirits and secure their  co-operation. If he desires rain, he must win the favour of the spirit  who controls it, if he would fell a tree and suffer no harm, he must by  suitable offerings entice the indwelling spirit to leave it. His  'theology' in this stage is the knowledge of the various spirits and  their dwellings, his ritual the due performance of sacrifice for  purposes of propitiation and expiation. It was in this state of  religious feeling that the ancestors of Rome must have lived before  they founded their agricultural settlement on the Palatine: we must try  now to see how far it had retained this character and what developments  it had undergone when it had crystallised into the 'Religion of Numa.'    FOOTNOTES:    [1] Frazer, _Golden Bough_, vol. i. pp. 81 ff.    [2] _Golden Bough_, vol. i. pp. 181-185.          CHAPTER III    MAIN FEATURES OF THE RELIGION OF NUMA      =1. Theology.=--The characteristic appellation of a divine spirit in  the oldest stratum of the Roman religion is not _deus_, a god, but  rather _numen_, a power: he becomes _deus_ when he obtains a name, and  so is on the way to acquiring a definite personality, but in origin he  is simply the 'spirit' of the 'animistic' period, and retains something  of the spirit's characteristics. Thus among the divinities of the  household we shall see later that the Genius and even the Lar  Familiaris, though they attained great dignity of conception, and were  the centre of the family life, and to some extent of the family  morality, never quite rose to the position of full-grown gods; while  among the spirits of the field the wildness and impishness of character  associated with Faunus and his companion Inuus--almost the cobolds or  hobgoblins of the flocks--reflects clearly the old 'animistic' belief  in the natural evilness of the spirits and their hostility to men. The  notion of the _numen_ is always vague and indefinite: even its sex may  be uncertain. 'Be thou god or goddess' is the form of address in the  farmer's prayer already quoted from Cato: 'be it male or female' is the  constant formula in liturgies and even dedicatory inscriptions of a  much later period.    These spirits are, as we have seen, indwellers in the objects of nature  and controllers of the phenomena of nature: but to the Roman they were  more. Not merely did they inhabit places and things, but they presided  over each phase of natural development, each state or action in the  life of man. Varro, for instance, gives us a list of the deities  concerned in the early life of the child, which, though it bears the  marks of priestly elaboration, may yet be taken as typical of the  feeling of the normal Roman family. There is Vaticanus, who opens the  child's mouth to cry, Cunina, who guards his cradle, Edulia and Potina,  who teach him to eat and drink, Statilinus, who helps him to stand up,  Adeona and Abeona, who watch over his first footstep, and many others  each with his special province of protection or assistance. The farmer  similarly is in the hands of a whole host of divinities who assist him  at each stage of ploughing, hoeing, sowing, reaping, and so forth. If  the _numen_ then lacks personal individuality, he has a very distinct  specialisation of function, and if man's appeal to the divinity is to  be successful, he must be very careful to make it in the right quarter:  it was a stock joke in Roman comedy to make a character 'ask for water  from Liber, or wine from the nymphs.' Hence we find in the prayer  formulae in Cato and elsewhere the most careful precautions to prevent  the accidental omission of the deity concerned: usually the worshipper  will go through the whole list of the gods who may be thought to have  power in the special circumstances; sometimes he will conclude his  prayer with the formula 'whosoever thou art,' or 'and any other name by  which thou mayest desire to be called.' The _numen_ is thus vague in  his conception but specialised in his function, and so later on, when  certain deities have acquired definite names and become prominent above  the rest, the worshipper in appealing to them will add a cult-title, to  indicate the special character in which he wishes the deity to hear:  the woman in childbirth will appeal to Iuno Lucina, the general praying  for victory to Iuppiter Victor, the man who is taking an oath to  Iuppiter as the deus Fidius. As a still later development the  cult-title will, as it were, break off and set up for itself, usually  in the form of an abstract personification: Iuppiter, in the two  special capacities just noted, gives birth to Victoria and Fides.    The conception of the _numen_ being so formless and indefinite, it is  not surprising that in the genuine Roman religion there should have  been no anthropomorphic representations of the divinity at all. 'For  170 years,' Varro tells us, taking his date from the traditional  foundation of the city in 754 B.C., 'the Romans worshipped their gods  without images,' and he adds the characteristic comment, 'those who  introduced representations among the nations, took away fear and  brought in falsehood.' Symbols of a few deities were no doubt  recognised: we have noticed already the _silex_ of Iuppiter and the  boundary-stone of Terminus, which were probably at an earlier period  themselves objects of worship, and to these we may add the sacred  spears of Mars, and the _sigilla_ of the State-Penates. But for the  most part the _numina_ were without even such symbolic representation,  nor till about the end of the regal period was any form of temple built  for them to dwell in. The sacred fire of Vesta near the Forum was, it  is true, from the earliest times enclosed in a building; this, however,  was no temple, but merely an erection with the essentially practical  purpose of preventing the extinction of the fire by rain. The first  temple in the full sense of the word was according to tradition built  by Servius Tullius to Diana on the Aventine: the tradition is  significant, for Diana was not one of the _di indigetes_, the old  deities of the 'Religion of Numa,' but was introduced from the  neighbouring town of Aricia, and the attribution to Servius"]]]
