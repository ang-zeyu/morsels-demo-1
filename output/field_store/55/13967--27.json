It seemed an age before he was  again seen, and Captain Drake expressed his fear that his head must  have been dashed against a rock, beneath the water.    But the men said:    \"He dives like a duck, sir, and has often frighted us by the time  he keeps under water. You will see, he will come up beyond the  second line of waves.\"    It seemed an age, to the watchers, before a black spot appeared  suddenly, beyond the foaming line of breakers. There was a general  shout of \"There he is!\" But they had scarce time to note the  position of the swimmer, when he again disappeared. Again and again  he came up, each time rapidly decreasing the distance between  himself and the shipwrecked vessel; and keeping his head above the  waves for a few seconds, only, at each appearance.    The people in the vessel were watching the progress of the lad,  with attention and interest even greater than was manifested by  those on shore; and as he approached the ship, which already showed  signs of breaking up, a line was thrown to him. He caught it, but  instead of holding on and being lifted to the ship, he fastened the  light rope which he had brought out to it, and made signs to them  to haul.    \"Fasten a thicker rope to it,\" he shouted, \"and they will haul it  in, from the shore.\"    It would have been no easy matter to get on board the ship; so,  having done his work, the lad turned to make his way back to the  shore.    A thick rope was fastened, at once, by those of the crew who still  remained on the deck of the vessel, to the lighter one; and those  on shore began to pull it rapidly in; but, ere the knotted joint  reached the shore, a cry from all gathered on the beach showed that  the brave attempt of the Otter had been useless. A tremendous sea  had struck the ship, and in a moment it broke up; and a number of  floating fragments, alone, showed where a fine vessel had, a few  minutes before, floated on the sea.    The lad paused in his course towards the shore and, looking round,  endeavored to face the driving wind and spray; in hopes that he  might see, among the fragments of the wreck, some one to whom his  assistance might be of use. For a time, he could see no signs of a  human being among the floating masses of wreck; and indeed, he was  obliged to use great caution in keeping away from these, as a blow  from any of the larger spars might have been fatal.    Presently, close to him, he heard a short muffled bark; and,  looking round, saw a large dog with a child in its mouth. The  animal, which was of the mastiff breed, appeared already exhausted.  The Otter looked hastily round and, seeing a piece of wreck of  suitable size, he seized it, and with some difficulty succeeded in  bringing it close to the dog. Fortunately the spar was a portion of  one of the yards, and still had a quantity of rope connected to it.  He now took hold of the child's clothes, the dog readily yielding  up the treasure he had carried, seeing that the newcomer was likely  to afford better assistance than himself.    In a few moments the child was fastened to the spar, and the Otter  began steadily to push it towards the shore; the dog swimming  alongside, evidently much relieved at getting rid of his burden.  When he neared the line of breakers the lad waved his hand, as a  sign to them to prepare to rush forward, and lend a hand, when the  spar approached. He then paddled forward quietly and, keeping just  outside the line of the breakers, waved to those on shore to throw,  if possible, a rope. Several attempts were made to hurl a stone,  fastened to the end of a light line, within his reach.    After many failures, he at last caught the line. This he fastened  to the spar, and signaled to those on shore to pull it in; then,  side by side with the dog, he followed. Looking round behind him,  he watched a great breaker rolling in and, as before, dived as it  passed over his head, and rode forward on the swell towards the  shore.    Then there was a desperate struggle. At one moment his feet touched  the ground, at another he was hauled back and tossed into the  whirling sea; sometimes almost losing his consciousness, but ever  keeping his head cool, and striving steadily to make progress.  Several times he was dashed against the beach with great force, and  it was his knowledge that the only safe way of approaching shore,  through a heavy surf, is to keep sideways to the waves, and allow  them to roll one over and over, that he escaped death--for, had he  advanced straight towards the shore, the force of the waves would  have rolled him heels-over-head, and would almost certainly have  broken his neck.    At last, just as consciousness was leaving him, and he thought that  he could struggle no more, a hand grasped his arm. The fishermen,  joining hand in hand, had gone down into the surf; and after many  ineffectual efforts, had at last seized him, as a retiring wave was  carrying him out again, for the fifth time.    With the consciousness of rescue all feeling left him, and it was  some minutes before he recovered his senses. His first question was  for the safety of the child on the spar, and he was glad to hear  that it had come to shore without hurt. The dog, too, had been  rolled up the beach, and seized before taken off again, but had  broken one of its legs.    The Otter was soon on his feet again and, saying, \"I must make my  way home, they will be alarmed about me,\" was about to turn away,  when a group of gentlemen standing near advanced.    \"You are a fine lad,\" one of them said to him. \"A fine lad, and an  honor to the south of Devonshire. My name is Francis Drake, and if  there be aught that I can do for you, now or hereafter, I shall be  glad, indeed, to do my utmost for so gallant a youth as yourself.\"    \"Oh, sir!\" the boy exclaimed, his cheek flushing with excitement.  \"If you are Master Francis Drake, will you let me join your ship,  for the voyage to the Indies?\"    \"Ah! my boy,\" the gentleman said, \"you have asked the only thing,  perhaps, which I should feel obliged to refuse you. Already we have  more than our number, and to avoid the importunity of the many who  wish to go, or of my powerful friends who desired to place sons or  relations in my charge, I have been obliged to swear that I would  take no other sailor, in addition to those already shipped.    \"You are, however, young,\" he said, as he marked the change in the  boy's face; \"and I promise you that if I come back, and again sail  on an expedition like that on which I now start, that you shall be  one of my crew. What is your name, lad? I hear them call you Otter,  and truly the beast is no better swimmer than you are.\"    \"My name, sir, is Ned Hearne. My father is the schoolmaster here.\"    \"Will he consent, think you, to your taking to a seafaring life?\"    \"Methinks he will, sir. He knows that my heart is set upon it, for  he hath often said if I loved my lessons with one-tenth of the love  I bear for the sea, I should make a good scholar, and be a credit  to him.\"    \"I will not forget you, lad. Trust me, and when you hear of my  return, fail not to send a reminder, and to claim a place in my  next adventure.\"    Ned Hearne, delighted at the assurance, ran off at full speed to  the cottage where his father resided, at the end of the village.  The dominie, who was an old man, wore the huge tortoise-shell  rimmed spectacles of the time.    \"Wet again,\" he said, as his son burst into the room in which he  was sitting, studying a Greek tome. \"Truly thou earnest the name of  which thou art so proud, Otter, hardly. What tempted thee to go  into the water, on a day like this?\"    Ned briefly explained what had taken place. The story was no  unusual one, for this was the third time that he had swum out to  vessels on the rocks between Westport and Plymouth. Then he related  to his father how Captain Francis Drake had spoken to him, and  praised him, and how he had promised that, on his next trip to the  West Indies, he would take him with him.    \"I would not have you count too much upon that,\" the dominie said,  dryly. \"It is like, indeed, that he may never come back from this  hare-brain adventure; and if he brings home his skin safe, he will,  methinks, have had enough of burning in the sun, and fighting the  Spaniards.\"    \"But hath he not already made two or three voyages thither,  Father?\" the boy asked.    \"That is true enough,\" said his father; \"but from what I gather,  these were mere trips to spy out the land. This affair on which he  starts now will be, I wot, a very different matter.\"    \"How is it, Father,\" the boy said on the following morning,  resuming the conversation from the point which they were at when he  went up to change his wet clothes, the day before, \"that when  England is at peace with Spain, our sailors and the Spanish do  fight bloodily, in the West Indies?\"    \"That, my son, is a point upon which the Roman law telleth us  nothing. I have, in my shelves, some very learned treatises on war;  but in none do I find mention of a state of things in which two  powers, at peace at home, do fight desperately at the extreme end  of the earth.\"    \"But, Father, do you think it not lawful to kill the Spaniard, and  to take the treasures which he robbeth from the poor heathen of the  West?\"    \"I know not about lawful, my son, but I see no warrant whatsoever  for it; and as for heathen, indeed, it appears to me that the  attacks upon him do touch, very closely, upon piracy upon the high  seas. However, as the country in general appeareth to approve of  it, and as it is said that the queen's most gracious majesty doth  gladly hear of the beating of the Spaniards, in those seas, it  becometh not me to question the rights of the case.\"    \"At any rate, Father, you would not object when the time comes for  me to sail with Mr. Francis Drake?\"    \"No, my boy; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19207"],[0,"The Firelight Fairy Book (#2)"],[1,"mountainside in the direction of the sound.    The Prince climbed and climbed, he went in this direction and in that,  yet the sound never grew any louder or fainter. Suddenly he realized  that he was hopelessly lost. The little path up which he had ridden had  vanished completely, and he had not the slightest idea in which  direction it lay. He called aloud, but only the mountain echoes answered  mockingly.    Night came, and the Prince took shelter behind a great rock. All the  next day he labored to find the path, but in vain. He grew very hungry  and cold. Every once in a while he would hear the roaring of the  waterfall, which seemed to have grown louder.    Another day dawned, and another day again. The Prince was getting very  weak. He knew that he was approaching the mysterious cataract, for the  noise of the water was now tremendous, and heaven and earth were full of  its roar. The third night came, and the full moon rose solemnly over the  snow-clad summits of the lonely and mysterious mountains. Suddenly the  Prince, walking blindly on, staggered through a narrow passage-way  between two splintered crags, and found himself face to face with the  mystery.    He stood on the snowy floor of a vast amphitheatre whose walls were the  steep sides of the giant mountains. Farthest away from him, and opposite  the moon, the wall of the bowl appeared as a giant black precipice,  whose top seemed to reach almost to the moon-dimmed stars; and over this  precipice a broad river was endlessly pouring, shining in the night like  the overflow of an ocean of molten silver. Though now very weak from  lack of food, and dizzy with the roaring of the cataract, the Prince  made his way to the shore of the foaming and eddying lake into which the  water was falling. Great was his surprise to discover that the overflow  of this lake disappeared into the earth through a long, low opening in  the cliff behind the fall. Greater still was his surprise to see a  strange many-colored light burning within the cave.    The Prince made his way toward the light, along a narrow beach of white  sand lying between the wall of the cavern and the racing waters of the  mysterious river, and found that the glow came from a magnificent  lantern studded with emeralds, topazes, amethysts, and rubies, which  hung by a chain from the roof of the grotto. Directly under this  lantern, drawn up on the sand, lay a little boat with a lantern fastened  to the bow. The Prince pushed the boat into the river, and got into it,  and the swift current seized him and hurried him away.    At first the cavern grew higher and wider; then it shrank again, and the  boat, borne along with incredible speed, shot down a rocky passageway  into the very heart of the earth. The passageway broadened once more,  and the boat rode gently through monstrous caves whose roofs were upheld  by twisted columns taller than the tallest tree. There were times when  all was so still that the Prince could easily have imagined himself back  in the solitude of the mountains; there were times when the foaming and  roaring of the underground river grew so deafening that the Prince  feared lest he might be approaching the brink of a subterranean  cataract.    Many hours passed. The Prince did not know whether it was night or day.  At length, while the boat was gliding through a vast hall, he fell  asleep. When he awoke, he found that the boat was floating on the black,  glassy surface of an immense underground ocean. All signs of the cavern  had disappeared. Far away, over the edge of this ocean, a strange,  beautiful glow mounted into the starless sky of the underworld. And  while the Prince was gazing at the glow, the boat swung into a new  current, and was borne swiftly toward the light. In a short time the  light grew so wide and bright that one would have believed that a  strange, golden sun had risen. The boat passed between two giant marble  pillars supporting enormous crystal globes filled with a golden fire,  and the Prince found himself in the harbor of Lantern Land.    A city lay before him, a strange golden city edging the shore of a vast,  semi-circular bay. Because in the centre of the earth there is neither  sun nor moon, the people have to be continually burning lights; and so  many and so great were the lanterns of Lantern Land that the town was as  bright as day. The edge of the harbor was marked with a row of golden  lanterns; there were immense lanterns at every six paces along the  streets; a lantern hung from every house; and the church-towers, instead  of having bells in them, had great golden lamps which illumined  everything for some distance about. Moreover, every inhabitant of  Lantern Land carried a lantern with him wherever he went, the rich  carrying golden lanterns set with transparent precious stones, the poor  carrying lights of ordinary glass.    Soon the Prince saw a magnificent ship coming out to meet him. The prow  was carved in the shape of a dragon's head, and a beautiful lantern hung  from its jaws. Overcome by hunger and fatigue, the poor Prince fell  insensible to the floor of his little boat. When he came to his senses  again, he was lying between sheets of the whitest, most delicate linen  in a great four-poster bed, in a room in the royal palace.    Thanks to his kind hosts, the Prince soon recovered his strength. When  he was completely himself again, he was summoned to an audience with the  Queen of Lantern Land.    The Queen, a very beautiful young woman, wearing a wonderful lantern  crown, sat on an ebony throne. On each side of the throne stood a tall  soldier, clad in scarlet and holding a long ebony staff surmounted by a  round lantern lit by a golden flame.    The Prince dropped on his knee, and thanked the Queen for her kindness  and hospitality.    \"You are the first stranger to come to Lantern Land for a thousand  years,\" said the young Queen. \"If it is not asking too much from a  guest, pray how did you happen to find the river of the underworld?\"    So the Prince told her that he was a king's son, and described his  adventures in the mountains. You may be sure the Queen was glad to hear  of his royal birth, for she had fallen in love with him at first sight.    A month passed. The Prince remained a guest in the palace. All kinds of  festivities were given in his honor; there were wonderful dances,  masquerades, picnics, and theatricals going on all the time. One day the  Prince and the Queen, accompanied by a little group of courtiers, rode  to the frontier of Lantern Land. The lovers galloped ahead of the party  and reached a little hill beyond which there were no more lanterns.  Ahead of them the rolling land, sweeping farther and farther away from  the light, grew darker and darker, till it finally plunged into the  eternal night of the underworld.    The Prince looked at the Queen, and saw that she was weeping.    \"Dear love, why do you weep?\" asked the Prince, who felt sad to see  tears in his lady's lovely eyes.    \"I weep to think that in spite of our love we must soon part forever,\"  said the Queen.    \"Part forever? Dear lady, what can you mean?\" said the anxious Prince.    \"A cruel fate hangs over us,\" replied the lady. \"Know, dear Prince, that  I am promised in marriage to the Enchanter Dragondel, and that in  exactly eight days, he will come here to claim my hand.\"    \"The Enchanter Dragondel--who is he?\" said the Prince.    \"Alas,\" said the Queen, \"the Enchanter Dragondel is the most powerful  magician of all the underworld. He is about eight feet tall, has cruel  sunken eyes that burn like dull fires, and dresses entirely in black. We  met at a ball given by the King of the Goblins. Dragondel pursued me  with compliments. A few days afterwards, an iron boat arrived in the  port of Lantern Land, having on board a giant blue dog who is  Dragondel's younger brother. This terrible animal, from whose sight the  people of Lantern Land fled screaming, made his way to the palace, and  dropped at my feet a jeweled casket, which he carried between his jaws.  The casket contained Dragondel's request for my hand, and added that,  were I to refuse him, he would let loose a legion of ghosts and other  winged spirits against the lanterns of Lantern Land. I had a vision of  Lantern Land in darkness; of my poor subjects dying of fear and  starvation. Rather than let this vision come true, I accepted the  Enchanter. Soon I shall never see you again, for Dragondel will come and  take me to his awful castle which lies on an island in the dark ocean.  Nor will you ever be able to save me, for Dragondel has so bewitched the  waves that a terrible whirlpool forms on the sea when a boat approaches  the enchanted castle, and engulfs it.\"    \"But I can fight Dragondel,\" said the Prince, like the brave youth that  he was.    \"That would be of little use,\" replied the Queen, \"for you would be  changed into a stone the instant you crossed swords with him. Tomorrow,  the blue dog arrives to remind me of my obligation, and to carry back to  the island some of the palace servants who are to make Dragondel's  castle ready for my coming.\"    The other members of the party now rode up, and the Queen dabbed her  eyes with her handkerchief, and pretended not to have been crying. The  Prince and the Queen felt very unhappy as they rode home.    On the next day, sure enough, the iron boat arrived, and the blue dog,  who was as large as a lion, went to the Queen's palace, and bade her  make ready for the coming wedding. A dozen of the Queen's servants were  then ordered to go with the blue dog to Dragondel's castle. Among these  servants, disguised as a kitchen lad, was the Prince; for he had  determined to see if there was not some way in which the young Queen  could be rescued from the wicked magician.    The boat neared the island, but no terrible whirlpool formed in the  enchanted sea. At last the boat reached Dragondel's castle. It stood on  the"]]]
