A few moments were sufficient to enable us all to recollect ourselves:  two men endeavoured to keep the boat's stern on to the sea, whilst the  rest of us lightened her by carrying everything we could on shore, after  which we hauled her up. The custom had always been for the other boat to  lie off until I made the signal for them to run in, and it accordingly  was now waiting outside the breakers. Her crew had not seen our  misfortunes owing to the height of the surf, which, when we were under  it, shut us out from their view, and now perceiving that we were on shore  and the boat hauled up, they concluded all was right; and notwithstanding  I made every possible sign to them not to beach, running as far as I  could venture into the sea and shouting out to them, my voice was drowned  by the roar of the surge, and I saw them bounding on to, what I thought,  certain destruction. We of course were all turned to render assistance.  They fortunately kept rather to the south of the spot on which we had  beached, and where it was much less rocky, so that the danger they  incurred in reaching the shore was slight in comparison to ours; yet some  of the planks of this boat were split throughout their entire length.    EXPLORE IN ITS VICINITY. COUNTRY ABOUT GANTHEAUME BAY. GEOLOGICAL  REMARKS. CROSS A DISTRICT OF RED SANDSTONE.    Whilst all hands were employed in endeavouring to repair damages I  ascended a hill to reconnoitre our present position and found we were in  a country of a pleasing and romantic appearance, and although the land  was not good the nature of the soil made me aware that we were most  probably in the vicinity of a large tract of better quality; indeed this  was the only part of South-west Australia in which I had met with the  ancient red sandstone of the north-west coast; immediately behind the  sandhills on which I stood was a thick Casuarina scrub which sloped down  into a deep valley, and beyond this rose lofty and fantastic hills. After  I had for some time looked round on this scene I returned to the party  and received the report of the carpenters, who, having examined the  boats, stated their inability to render either of them fit for sea. To  this I had already made up my mind; and even if the boats had been  uninjured I doubt whether we could ever have got them off again through  the tremendous surf which was breaking on this part of the shore; whilst  to have moved them to any distance would, in our present weak and  enfeebled state, have been utterly impossible.    ESTUARY AND LANDING-PLACE AND SCENERY ABOUT IT.    No resource was now left to us but to endeavour to reach Perth by  walking; yet when I looked at the sickly faces of some of the party and  saw their wasted forms I much doubted if they retained strength to  execute such a task; but they themselves were in high spirits and talked  of the undertaking as a mere trifle. I gave orders for the necessary  preparations to be made and then started with two or three hands to  search for water. On reaching the valley I have before mentioned we found  a small stream, and following this to the northward for about a mile came  out upon one of the most romantic and picturesque-looking estuaries I had  yet seen: its shores abounded with springs and were bordered by native  paths, whilst the drooping foliage of several large sorts of Casuarina,  the number of wild swans on its placid bosom, and the natives fishing in  the distance, unconscious of our presence, imparted to the whole scene a  quiet and a charm which was deeply felt by those who had now for so many  days been either tossed about by the winds and waves or had long been  wandering over barren and inhospitable shores. We did not indeed find  much good land about this estuary, but there were rich flats upon each  side of it, whilst the nature of the rocks and the lofty and peculiar  character of the distant hills gave promise of the most fertile region I  had yet seen in extra-tropical Australia.    We followed the shores of the estuary to the northward and eastward until  we saw a point where it appeared to separate into two branches. The  natives decamped as soon as they observed us coming, and Kaiber, who  watched them with the most intense interest, indulged in various  speculations as to the number they would bring back when they returned.  We joined the party and traced the shores of the estuary to its mouth,  which turned out to be the opening we saw in the morning: this mouth is  completely sheltered by a line of breakers and reefs, which, although  they present a most formidable appearance from the sea, can be doubled by  keeping pretty close along the shore in approaching the mouth of the  river. Owing to this reef there are no breakers on the bar, but its mouth  is very narrow and so shoal that I doubt if a boat could be got in at any  other time than high water: some of the sailors with me however thought  otherwise; but there is at all events convenient landing at this point  under the shelter of the reef.    FERTILE COUNTRY.    April 2.    The men not having quite completed their preparations for starting, I  moved off at dawn to resume the survey of Gantheaume Bay and its  vicinity. The estuary appeared this morning even more lovely than  yesterday, and as the heavy morning mists arose, unfolding its beauties  to our view, all those feelings came thrilling through my mind which  explorers alone can know; flowering shrubs and trees, drooping foliage, a  wide and placid expanse of water met the view; trickling springs and  fertile flats were passed over by us; there was much barren land visible  in the distance, though many a sign and token might lead the practical  explorer to hope that he was about to enter upon a tract of an extent and  fertility yet unknown in south-west Australia. A total change had taken  place in the geological formation of the land: a rock as yet unobserved  in the south-west portion of the continent occupied the principal place  here; and with this rock was associated limestone; the springs had a  strong sulphureous smell, and the lofty broken character of the distant  mountains had an almost grand appearance to those who had so long  wandered through low and level countries.    Each step I took rendered my spirits more buoyant and elastic, and each  hill, the position of which I fixed, gave me, from its appearance,  renewed hopes. Under such agreeable circumstances the morning wore  rapidly away, and, having rendered my survey as complete as I could, we  returned to the boats.    COMMENCE THE MARCH TO PERTH. PROVISIONS DIVIDED.    We were now all ready to commence our toilsome journey; the provisions  had been shared out; twenty pounds of flour and one pound of salt  provisions per man, being all that was left. What I have here designated  by the name of flour was quite unworthy of being so called. It was of a  dark yellowish brown colour, and had such a sour fermented taste that  nothing but absolute necessity could induce anyone to eat it. The party  however were in high spirits; they talked of a walk of three hundred  miles in a direct line through the country (without taking hills,  valleys, and necessary deviations into account) as a trifle, and in  imagination were already feasting at home and taking their ease after the  toils they had undergone.    I gave them all warning of the many difficulties they had yet to  encounter, and did this not with the intention of damping their ardour  but in the hope of inducing them to abandon some portion of the loads  they intended to carry. I entrusted a small pocket chronometer to Mr.  Walker, and another to Corporals Coles and Auger; and to Ruston I gave  charge of a pocket-sextant which belonged to the Surveyor-General at  Perth. Coles and Auger also undertook to carry a large sextant, turn  about; all my own papers, such charts as I thought necessary, and some  smaller instruments I bore myself; but Kaiber, in order to relieve me,  took charge of my gun and some other articles. Mr. Smith carried his  sketchbook and box of colours. I ought here to state that, in all the  difficulties which beset those individuals to whom I entrusted anything,  they never, except on one occasion, and by my orders, abandoned it:  indeed I do not believe that there is a stronger instance of fidelity and  perseverance than was evinced by some of the party in retaining, under  every difficulty, possession of that which they had promised to preserve  for me.    PICTURESQUE HALTING-PLACE.    Our loads having been hoisted on our shoulders away we moved. I had  before chosen my line of route, and the plan I had resolved to adopt was  to walk on slowly but continuously for an hour, and then to halt for ten  minutes; during which interval of time the men could rest and relieve  themselves from the weight of their burdens whilst I could enter what  notes and bearings I had taken during the preceding hour.    We were embarrassed for the first portion of our journey this afternoon  by a thick scrub, through which we could only make our way with great  difficulty, but on coming to a watercourse running into the southern part  of Gantheaume Bay from the south-east I turned up its bed, and we were  then able to move along with tolerable facility. This watercourse ran at  the bottom of a red sandstone ravine resembling the old red sandstone of  England; and the remainder of the evening was spent in clambering about  the rocks and endeavouring to avoid such natural obstacles as impeded our  route. Our progress was slow, and just before nightfall I turned up a  branch ravine trending to the southward, when we soon found ourselves at  the foot of a lofty cascade down which a little water was slowly  dropping; and on climbing to its summit it appeared to be so well adapted  for a halting-place for the night that I determined to remain here.

CHAPTER I.                           THE VALUE OF ARCHAEOLOGY.      The archaeologist whose business it is to bring to light by pick and  spade the relics of bygone ages, is often accused of devoting his  energies to work which is of no material profit to mankind at the  present day. Archaeology is an unapplied science, and, apart from its  connection with what is called culture, the critic is inclined to judge  it as a pleasant and worthless amusement. There is nothing, the critic  tells us, of pertinent value to be learned from the Past which will be  of use to the ordinary person of the present time; and, though the  archaeologist can offer acceptable information to the painter, to the  theologian, to the philologist, and indeed to most of the followers of  the arts and sciences, he has nothing to give to the ordinary layman.    In some directions the imputation is unanswerable; and when the  interests of modern times clash with those of the past, as, for example,  in Egypt where a beneficial reservoir has destroyed the remains of early  days, there can be no question that the recording of the threatened  information and the minimising of the destruction, is all that the  value of the archaeologist's work entitles him to ask for. The critic,  however, usually overlooks some of the chief reasons that archaeology can  give for even this much consideration, reasons which constitute its  modern usefulness; and I therefore propose to point out to him three or  four of the many claims which it may make upon the attention of the  layman.    In the first place it is necessary to define the meaning of the term  \"Archaeology.\" Archaeology is the study of the facts of ancient history  and ancient lore. The word is applied to the study of all ancient  documents and objects which may be classed as antiquities; and the  archaeologist is understood to be the man who deals with a period for  which the evidence has to be excavated or otherwise discovered. The age  at which an object becomes an antiquity, however, is quite undefined,  though practically it may be reckoned at a hundred years; and ancient  history is, after all, the tale of any period which is not modern. Thus  an archaeologist does not necessarily deal solely with the remote ages.    Every chronicler of the events of the less recent times who goes to the  original documents for his facts, as true historians must do during at  least a part of their studies, is an archaeologist; and, conversely,  every archaeologist who in the course of his work states a series of  historical facts, becomes an historian. Archaeology and history are  inseparable; and nothing is more detrimental to a noble science than  the attitude of certain so-called archaeologists who devote their entire  time to the study of a sequence of objects without proper consideration  for the history which those objects reveal. Antiquities are the relics  of human mental energy; and they can no more be classified without  reference to the minds which produced them than geological specimens can  be discussed without regard to the earth. There is only one thing worse  than the attitude of the archaeologist who does not study the story of  the periods with which he is dealing, or construct, if only in his  thoughts, living history out of the objects discovered by him; and that  is the attitude of the historian who has not familiarised himself with  the actual relics left by the people of whom he writes, or has not, when  possible, visited their lands. There are many \"archaeologists\" who do not  care a snap of the fingers for history, surprising as this may appear;  and there are many historians who take no interest in manners and  customs. The influence of either is pernicious.    It is to be understood, therefore, that in using the word Archaeology I  include History: I refer to history supplemented and aggrandised by the  study of the arts, crafts, manners, and customs of the period under  consideration.    As a first argument the value of archaeology in providing a precedent for  important occurrences may be considered. Archaeology is the structure of  ancient history, and it is the voice of history which tells us that a  Cretan is always a Cretan, and a Jew always a Jew. History, then, may  well take her place as a definite asset of statecraft, and the law of  Precedent may be regarded as a fundamental factor in international  politics. What has happened before may happen again; and it is the hand  of the archaeologist that directs our attention to the affairs and  circumstances of olden times, and warns us of the possibilities of their  recurrence. It may be said that the statesman who has ranged in the  front of his mind the proven characteristics of the people with whom he  is dealing has a perquisite of the utmost importance.    Any archaeologist who, previous to the rise of Japan during the latter  half of the nineteenth century, had made a close study of the history of  that country and the character of its people, might well have predicted  unerringly its future advance to the position of a first-class power.  The amazing faculty of imitation displayed by the Japanese in old times  was patent to him. He had seen them borrow part of their arts, their  sciences, their crafts, their literature, their religion, and many of  their customs from the Chinese; and he might have been aware that they  would likewise borrow from the West, as soon as they had intercourse  with it, those essentials of civilisation which would raise them to  their present position in the world. To him their fearlessness, their  tenacity, and their patriotism, were known; and he was so well aware of  their powers of organisation, that he might have foreseen the rapid  development which was to take place.    What historian who has read the ancient books of the Irish--the Book of  the Dun Cow, the Book of Ballymote, the Book of Lismore, and the  like--can show either surprise or dismay at the events which have  occurred in Ireland in modern times? Of the hundreds of kings of Ireland  whose histories are epitomised in such works as that of the old  archaeologist Keating, it would be possible to count upon the fingers  those who have died in peace; and the archaeologist, thus, knows better  than to expect the descendants of these kings to live in harmony one  with the other. National characteristics do not change unless, as in the  case of the Greeks, the stock also changes.    In the Jews we have another example of the persistence of those national  characteristics which history has made known to us. The Jews first  appear in the dimness of the remote past as a group of nomad tribes,  wandering over southern Palestine, Egypt, and the intervening deserts;  and at the present day we see them still homeless, scattered over the  face of the globe, the \"tribe of the wandering foot and weary breast.\"    In no country has the archaeologist been more active than in Egypt during  the last half century, and the contributions which his spade and pick  have offered to history are of first-rate importance to that study as a  whole. The eye may now travel down the history of the Nile Valley from  prehistoric days to the present time almost without interruption; and  now that the anthropologist has shown that the modern Egyptians,  Mussulman and Copt, peasant and townsman, belong to one and the same  race of ancient Egyptians, one may surely judge to-day's inhabitants of  the country in the light of yesterday's records. In his report for the  year 1906, Lord Cromer, questioning whether the modern inhabitants of  the country were capable of governing their own land, tells us that we  must go back to the precedent of Pharaonic days to discover if the  Egyptians ever ruled themselves successfully.    In this pregnant remark Lord Cromer was using information which the  archaeologist and historian had made accessible to him. Looking back over  the history of the country, he was enabled, by the study of this  information, to range before him the succession of foreign occupations  of the Nile Valley and to assess their significance. It may be worth  while to repeat the process, in order to give an example of the bearing  of history upon modern polemics, though I propose to discuss this matter  more fully in another chapter.    Previous to the British occupation the country was ruled, as it is now,  by a noble dynasty of Albanian princes, whose founder was set upon the  throne by the aid of Turkish and Albanian troops. From the beginning of  the sixteenth century until that time Egypt had been ruled by the  Ottoman Government, the Turk having replaced the Circassian and other  foreign \"Mamlukes\" who had held the country by the aid of foreign troops  since the middle of the thirteenth century. For a hundred years previous  to the Mamluke rule Egypt had been in the hands of the Syrian and  Arabian dynasty founded by Saladdin. The Fatimides, a North African  dynasty, governed the country before the advent of Saladdin, this family  having entered Egypt under their general, Jauhar, who was of Greek  origin. In the ninth century Ahmed ibn Tulun, a Turk, governed the land  with the aid of a foreign garrison, his rule being succeeded by the  Ikhshidi dynasty of foreigners. Ahmed had captured Egypt from the  Byzantines who had held it since the days of the Roman occupation.  Previous to the"]]]
