That boastful  Thraso, foaming and gnashing his teeth, proclaimed that he would dare  all things for the glory of God and for the honour of the holy apostolic  seat; and, being puffed up respecting your power, which he was about  to misuse, he looked forward with all certainty to victory; seeking to  promote, not so much the primacy of Peter, as his own pre-eminence among  the theologians of this age; for he thought it would contribute in no  slight degree to this, if he were to lead Luther in triumph. The result  having proved unfortunate for the sophist, an incredible rage torments  him; for he feels that whatever discredit to Rome has arisen through me  has been caused by the fault of himself alone.    Suffer me, I pray you, most excellent Leo, both to plead my own cause,  and to accuse your true enemies. I believe it is known to you in what  way Cardinal Cajetan, your imprudent and unfortunate, nay unfaithful,  legate, acted towards me. When, on account of my reverence for your  name, I had placed myself and all that was mine in his hands, he did not  so act as to establish peace, which he could easily have established by  one little word, since I at that time promised to be silent and to make  an end of my case, if he would command my adversaries to do the same.  But that man of pride, not content with this agreement, began to justify  my adversaries, to give them free licence, and to order me to recant, a  thing which was certainly not in his commission. Thus indeed, when the  case was in the best position, it came through his vexatious tyranny  into a much worse one. Therefore whatever has followed upon this is the  fault not of Luther, but entirely of Cajetan, since he did not suffer me  to be silent and remain quiet, which at that time I was entreating for  with all my might. What more was it my duty to do?    Next came Charles Miltitz, also a nuncio from your Blessedness. He,  though he went up and down with much and varied exertion, and omitted  nothing which could tend to restore the position of the cause thrown  into confusion by the rashness and pride of Cajetan, had difficulty,  even with the help of that very illustrious prince the Elector  Frederick, in at last bringing about more than one familiar conference  with me. In these I again yielded to your great name, and was prepared  to keep silence, and to accept as my judge either the Archbishop of  Treves, or the Bishop of Naumburg; and thus it was done and concluded.  While this was being done with good hope of success, lo! that other and  greater enemy of yours, Eccius, rushed in with his Leipsic disputation,  which he had undertaken against Carlstadt, and, having taken up a  new question concerning the primacy of the Pope, turned his arms  unexpectedly against me, and completely overthrew the plan for peace.  Meanwhile Charles Miltitz was waiting, disputations were held, judges  were being chosen, but no decision was arrived at. And no wonder! for  by the falsehoods, pretences, and arts of Eccius the whole business was  brought into such thorough disorder, confusion, and festering soreness,  that, whichever way the sentence might lean, a greater conflagration was  sure to arise; for he was seeking, not after truth, but after his own  credit. In this case too I omitted nothing which it was right that I  should do.    I confess that on this occasion no small part of the corruptions of Rome  came to light; but, if there was any offence in this, it was the fault  of Eccius, who, in taking on him a burden beyond his strength, and in  furiously aiming at credit for himself, unveiled to the whole world the  disgrace of Rome.    Here is that enemy of yours, Leo, or rather of your Court; by his  example alone we may learn that an enemy is not more baneful than a  flatterer. For what did he bring about by his flattery, except evils  which no king could have brought about? At this day the name of the  Court of Rome stinks in the nostrils of the world, the papal authority  is growing weak, and its notorious ignorance is evil spoken of. We  should hear none of these things, if Eccius had not disturbed the plans  of Miltitz and myself for peace. He feels this clearly enough himself in  the indignation he shows, too late and in vain, against the publication  of my books. He ought to have reflected on this at the time when he was  all mad for renown, and was seeking in your cause nothing but his own  objects, and that with the greatest peril to you. The foolish man hoped  that, from fear of your name, I should yield and keep silence; for I  do not think he presumed on his talents and learning. Now, when he sees  that I am very confident and speak aloud, he repents too late of his  rashness, and sees--if indeed he does see it--that there is One in  heaven who resists the proud, and humbles the presumptuous.    Since then we were bringing about by this disputation nothing but the  greater confusion of the cause of Rome, Charles Miltitz for the third  time addressed the Fathers of the Order, assembled in chapter, and  sought their advice for the settlement of the case, as being now in a  most troubled and perilous state. Since, by the favour of God, there  was no hope of proceeding against me by force, some of the more noted of  their number were sent to me, and begged me at least to show respect to  your person and to vindicate in a humble letter both your innocence  and my own. They said that the affair was not as yet in a position of  extreme hopelessness, if Leo X., in his inborn kindliness, would put his  hand to it. On this I, who have always offered and wished for peace, in  order that I might devote myself to calmer and more useful pursuits, and  who for this very purpose have acted with so much spirit and vehemence,  in order to put down by the strength and impetuosity of my words, as  well as of my feelings, men whom I saw to be very far from equal to  myself--I, I say, not only gladly yielded, but even accepted it with joy  and gratitude, as the greatest kindness and benefit, if you should think  it right to satisfy my hopes.    Thus I come, most blessed Father, and in all abasement beseech you  to put to your hand, if it is possible, and impose a curb to those  flatterers who are enemies of peace, while they pretend peace. But there  is no reason, most blessed Father, why any one should assume that I am  to utter a recantation, unless he prefers to involve the case in  still greater confusion. Moreover, I cannot bear with laws for the  interpretation of the word of God, since the word of God, which teaches  liberty in all other things, ought not to be bound. Saving these two  things, there is nothing which I am not able, and most heartily willing,  to do or to suffer. I hate contention; I will challenge no one; in  return I wish not to be challenged; but, being challenged, I will not be  dumb in the cause of Christ my Master. For your Blessedness will be able  by one short and easy word to call these controversies before you and  suppress them, and to impose silence and peace on both sides--a word  which I have ever longed to hear.    Therefore, Leo, my Father, beware of listening to those sirens who  make you out to be not simply a man, but partly a god, so that you can  command and require whatever you will. It will not happen so, nor will  you prevail. You are the servant of servants, and more than any other  man, in a most pitiable and perilous position. Let not those men deceive  you who pretend that you are lord of the world; who will not allow any  one to be a Christian without your authority; who babble of your having  power over heaven, hell, and purgatory. These men are your enemies and  are seeking your soul to destroy it, as Isaiah says, \"My people, they  that call thee blessed are themselves deceiving thee.\" They are in error  who raise you above councils and the universal Church; they are in error  who attribute to you alone the right of interpreting Scripture. All  these men are seeking to set up their own impieties in the Church under  your name, and alas! Satan has gained much through them in the time of  your predecessors.    In brief, trust not in any who exalt you, but in those who humiliate  you. For this is the judgment of God: \"He hath cast down the mighty from  their seat, and hath exalted the humble.\" See how unlike Christ was to  His successors, though all will have it that they are His vicars. I fear  that in truth very many of them have been in too serious a sense His  vicars, for a vicar represents a prince who is absent. Now if a pontiff  rules while Christ is absent and does not dwell in his heart, what  else is he but a vicar of Christ? And then what is that Church but a  multitude without Christ? What indeed is such a vicar but antichrist  and an idol? How much more rightly did the Apostles speak, who call  themselves servants of a present Christ, not the vicars of an absent  one!    Perhaps I am shamelessly bold in seeming to teach so great a head, by  whom all men ought to be taught, and from whom, as those plagues of  yours boast, the thrones of judges receive their sentence; but I imitate  St. Bernard in his book concerning Considerations addressed to Eugenius,  a book which ought to be known by heart by every pontiff. I do this, not  from any desire to teach, but as a duty, from that simple and faithful  solicitude which teaches us to be anxious for all that is safe for  our neighbours, and does not allow considerations of worthiness or  unworthiness to be entertained, being intent only on the dangers or  advantage of others. For since I know that your Blessedness is driven  and tossed by the waves at Rome, so that the depths of the sea press  on you with infinite perils, and that you are labouring under such a  condition of misery that you need even the least help from any the least  brother, I do not seem to myself to be acting unsuitably if I forget  your majesty till I shall have fulfilled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19115"],[0,"Roman Britain in 1914 (#2)"],[1,"further successes.  Evidence seems to be coming out as to the hitherto missing forts of  Kirkintilloch and Inveravon. More details have been secured of the fort  at Mumrills--fully 4-1/2 acres in area and walled with earth, not with  the turf or stone employed in the ramparts of the other forts of the  Wall. The line of the Wall from Falkirk to Inveravon, a distance of four  miles, has also been traced; it proved to be built of earth and clay,  not of the turf used in the Wall westwards. Dr. Macdonald suggests that  the eastern section of the Wall lay through heavily wooded country,  where turf was naturally awanting.    (iii) _Traprain Law._ Very interesting, too, are the preliminary  results secured by Mr. A. O. Curie on Traprain Law. This is an isolated  hill in Haddingtonshire, some twenty miles east of Edinburgh, on the  Whittingehame estate of Mr. Arthur Balfour. Legends cluster round it--of  varying antiquity. It itself shows two distinct lines of fortification,  one probably much older than the other, enclosing some 60 acres. The  area excavated in 1914 was a tiny piece, about 30 yards square; the  results were most promising. Five levels of stratification could be  distinguished. The lowest and earliest yielded small objects of native  work and Roman potsherds of the late first century: higher up, Roman  coins and pottery of the second century appeared, and in the top level,  Roman potsherds assigned to the fourth century. One Roman potsherd, from  a second-century level, bore three Roman letters IRI, the meaning of  which is likely to remain obscure. As the inscribed surface came from  the inside of an urn, the writing must have been done after the pot was  broken, and presumably on the hill itself. Among the native finds were  stone and clay moulds for casting metal objects. The site, on a whole,  seems to be native rather than Roman; it may be our first clue to the  character of native _oppida_ in northern Britain under Roman rule;  its excavation is eminently worth pursuing.    (iv) _Northumberland, Hadrian's Wall._ On Hadrian's Wall no excavations  have been carried out. But at Chesterholm two inscribed altars were  found in the summer. One was dedicated to Juppiter Optimus Maximus;  the rest of the lettering was illegible. The other, dedicated to Vulcan  on behalf of the Divinity of the Imperial House by the people of the  locality, possesses much interest. The dedicators describe themselves as  _vicani Vindolandenses_, and thus give proof that the civilians living  outside the fort at Chesterholm formed a _vicus_ or something that could  plausibly be described as such; further, they teach the proper name of  the place, which we have been wont to call Vindolana. See further below,  p. 31.    North of the Wall, at Featherwood near High Rochester (the fort  Bremenium) an altar has been found, dedicated to Victory (see p. 30).    (v) _Corbridge._ The exploration of Corbridge was carried through its  ninth season by Mr. R. H. Forster. As in 1913, the results were somewhat  scanty. The area examined, which lay on the north-east of the site,  adjacent to the areas examined in 1910 and 1913, seems, like them, to  have been thinly occupied in Roman times; at any rate the structures  actually unearthed consisted only of a roughly built foundation (25 feet  diam.) of uncertain use, which there is no reason to call a temple, some  other even more indeterminate foundations, and two bits of road. More  interest may attach to three ditches (one for sewage) and the clay base  of a rampart, which belong in some way to the northern defences of the  place in various times. The full meaning of these will, however, not be  discernible till complete plans are available and probably not till  further excavations have been made; Mr. Forster inclines to explain  parts of them as ditches of a fort held in the age of Trajan, about A.D.  90-110. Several small finds merit note. An inscribed tile seems to have  served as a writing lesson or rather, perhaps, as a reading lesson: see  below, p. 32. The Samian pottery included a very few pieces of '29', a  good deal of early '37', which most archaeologists would ascribe to the  late first or the opening second century, and some other pieces which  perhaps belong to a rather later part of the same century. The coins  cover much the same period; few are later than Hadrian. Among them was  a hoard of 32 denarii and 12 copper of which Mr. Craster has made the  following list:--        _Silver_: 2 Republican, 1 Julius Caesar, 1 Mark Antony, 1 Nero,      1 Galba, 3 Vitellius, 13 Vespasian, 3 Titus, 6 Domitian,      1 unidentified.        _Copper_: 3 Vespasian, 1 Titus, 2 Domitian, 3 Nerva, 1 Trajan,      2 unidentified.    The latest coin was the copper of Trajan--a _dupondius_ or Second  Brass of A.D. 98. All the coins had been corroded into a single mass,  apparently by the burning of a wooden box in which they have been kept;  this burning must have occurred about A.D. 98-100. Among the bronze  objects found during the year was a dragonesque enamelled brooch.    (vi) In Upper _Weardale_ (co. Durham) a peat-bog has given up two bronze  _paterae_ or skillets, bearing the stamp of the Italian bronze-worker  Cipius Polybius, and an uninscribed bronze ladle. See below, p. 33.    (vii) Near Appleby, at Hangingshaw farm, Mr. P. Ross has come upon a  Roman inscription which proves to be a milestone of the Emperor Philip  (A.D. 244-6) first found in 1694 and since lost sight of (p. 35).    (viii) _Ambleside Fort._ The excavation of the Roman fort in Borrans  Field near Ambleside, noted in my Report for 1913 (p. 13), was continued  by Mr. R. G. Collingwood, Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, and others  with much success. The examination of the ramparts, gates, and turrets  was completed; that of the main interior buildings was brought near  completion, and a beginning was made on the barracks, sufficient to show  that they were, at least in part, made of wood.    [Illustration: FIG. 2. BORRANS FORT, AMBLESIDE    (I. Granaries; II. Head-quarters; III. Commandant's House; A. Cellar;  B. Hearth or Kiln; C. Deposit of corn; D. Ditch perhaps belonging to  earliest fort; E. Outer Court of Head-quarters; F. Inner Court)]    The fort, as is now clear (fig. 2), was an oblong enclosure of about 300  x 420 feet, nearly 3 acres. Round it ran a wall of roughly coursed stone  4 feet thick, with a clay ramp behind and a ditch in front. Turrets  stood at its corners. Four gates gave access to it; three of them were  single and narrow, while the fourth, the east gate, was double and was  flanked by two guard-chambers. As usual, the chief buildings stood in a  row across the interior. Building I--see plan, fig. 2--was a pair of  granaries, each 66 feet long, with a space between. They were of normal  plan, with external buttresses, basement walls, and ventilating windows  (not shown on plan). The space between them, 15 feet wide, contained  marks of an oven or ovens (plan, B) and also some corn (plan, C) and may  have been at one time used for drying grain stored in the granaries; how  far it was roofed is doubtful. Building II, the Principia or Praetorium,  a structure of 68 x 76 feet, much resembled the Principia at Hardknot,  ten miles west of Ambleside, but possessed distinct features. As the  plan shows, it had an entrance from the east, the two usual courts (EF),  and the offices which usually face on to the inner court F. These  offices, however, were only three in number instead of five, unless  wooden partitions were used. Under the central office, the _sacellum_ of  the fort, where the standards and the altars for the official worship of  the garrison are thought to have been kept, our fort had, at A, a sunk  room or cellar, 6 feet square, entered by a stone stair. Such cellars  occur at Chesters, Aesica, and elsewhere and probably served as  strong-rooms for the regimental funds. At Chesters, the cellar had stone  vaulting; at Ambleside there is no sign of this, and timber may have  been used. In the northernmost room of the Principia some corn and  woodwork as of a bin were noted (plan, C). The inner court F seemed to  Mr. Collingwood to have been roofed; in its north end was a detached  room, such as occurs at Chesters, of unknown use, which accords rather  ill with a roof. In the colonnade round the outer court E were vestiges  of a hearth or oven (plan, B). Building III (70 x 80 feet) is that  usually called the commandant's house; it seems to show the normal plan  of rooms arranged round a cloister enclosing a tiny open space. In  buildings II and III, at D, traces were detected as of ditches and  walling belonging to a fort older and probably smaller than that  revealed by the excavation generally.    Small finds include coins of Faustina Iunior, Iulia Domna, and Valens,  Samian of about A.D. 80 and later, including one or two bits of German  Samian, a silver spoon, some glass, iron, and bronze objects, a leaden  basin (?), and seven more leaden sling-bullets. It now seems clear that  the fort was established about the time of Agricola (A.D. 80-5), though  perhaps in smaller dimensions than those now visible, and was held till  at least A.D. 365. Mr. Collingwood inclines to the view that it was  abandoned after A.D. 85 and reoccupied under or about the time of  Hadrian. The stratification of the turrets seems to show that it was  destroyed once or twice in the second or third centuries, but the  evidence is not wholly clear in details. The granaries seem to have been  rebuilt once and the rooms of the commandant's house mostly have two  floors.    (ix) _Lancaster._ In October and November 1914, structural remains  thought to be Roman, including 'an old Roman fireplace, circular in  shape, with stone flues branching out', were noted in the garden of St.  Mary's vicarage. The real meaning of the find seems doubtful.    (x) _Ribchester._ In the spring of 1913 a small school-building"]]]
