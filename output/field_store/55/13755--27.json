(_To the Editor._)      In your Correspondent _Selim's_ laudable endeavour to vindicate  the ancient inhabitants of this island from the character of barbarians  given them by Caesar, he has made some errors, which, with your  permission, I will attempt to rectify. First, I beg leave to dissent  from the derivation of the word Druid, \"Druidh,\" a wise man, as such  a word is not to be found in the Welsh language. In one of your early  volumes[5] there is a letter from a Correspondent, deriving the word (in  the above language it is written Derwydd) from Dar and Gwydd, signifying  chief in the presence, as the religious ceremonies of the Druids were  considered to be performed in the presence of the Deity. This may seem  far fetched; but, according to the genius of the language, any word  commencing with _g_, and having another word prefixed, the sound of  the _g_ is always dropped: therefore, those words would be written  Dar-wydd, only a difference of one letter from the proper word.    With regard to the statement of the Druids being \"ever foremost in the  battle strife,\" as your Correspondent has quoted Caesar, I am surprised  that he has overlooked this passage: \"The Druids were exempt from all  military payment, and excused from serving in the wars;\" indeed, one of  the main objects of Bardism was to maintain peace, and the use of arms  was therefore prohibited to its members; though in later times it was  one of the duties of the king's domestic bard, on the day of battle,  to sing in front of the army the national song of \"Unbennaeth Prydain\"  (the Monarchy of Britain,) for the purpose of animating the soldiers.    It is not possible that a people possessing the three orders of Druid,  Bard, and Ovate, who, (leaving their poetry out of the question for the  present,) were able to raise the immense piles of Abury and Stonehenge,  could be the barbarians they are thought to be; and those who could  raise such immense blocks of stone deserve at least credit for  ingenuity. Now, it does not appear to me to require a great stretch of  fancy to believe that the requisite knowledge was obtained of the  architects of the Pyramids, Temples, and cities of Egypt and the east:  and this is not improbable; as, according to the Triads, the Cymmry (or  Welsh) came from the Gwlad yr Haf,[6] (the summer country) the present  Taurida; and further, Herodotus says, that a nation called Cimmerians,  (very much like their own name,) dwelt in that part of Europe and the  neighbouring parts of Asia. Other historians are of similar opinion, and  considering the numerous emigrations from Egypt, caused by religious  persecutions and conquests, it is very likely that some of their priests  or learned men were among those exiles, and that they communicated their  knowledge to the same description of persons belonging to the nations  with whom they sojourned. The founders of Athens and Thebes were exiles;  and the Philistines, noted for their constant wars with the Jews, were  originally expelled from Egypt. I have been informed that there has been  found in the southern part of the United States, the remains of a  building similar in its appearance to Stonehenge. Did a remnant of those  Druids or Priests erect this and the Temples of Mexico, and leave behind  them those implements of war and industry that have been found in the  soil and in the mines of America? and to equal the manufacture of which,  all the resources of modern art have proved inadequate. It appears that  there existed at a most remote period, a sort of Freemasonry of priests,  bards, and architects, who, and their successors extended themselves  over the whole world; for, to whom else can be ascribed those stupendous  structures, the ruins of which at the present day excite our admiration  and wonder, and may be traced over Asia, Egypt, along the shores of the  Mediterranean, in Britain and America. That the ancients knew of America  is not improbable, when we recollect the extent of the voyages of the  Phoenicians and Carthaginians, and what has been said of the great  Island of Atlantis; it is not likely that Prince Madog would have  sailed in search of a distant land if he had not heard something of its  existence. In the fifth century, a chieftain named Gafran ab Aeddan,  went in search of some islands called Gwerddonau Lliou, (Green Isles  of the Floods,) supposed to be the Canaries; but whether he succeeded  in reaching them is not known, as he was never heard of after he left  Britain. This is a proof that the Welsh at least, had heard of distant  lands in the Atlantic Ocean: another curious fact is, that the worship  of the sun was prevalent in all the countries in which those remains  have been found. In conclusion, I beg leave to say that the people could  not be very barbarous, who were in the habit of hearing such precepts  as \"the three ultimate objects of bardism--to reform _manners_ and  _customs_, to secure _peace_, and to extol every thing that is good.\"    _Llundain_.

Perhaps neither of the exercises that are indispensable to the health  and comfort of man has so kept pace with his progressive improvement as  bathing; and though of late years this effectual promoter of cleanliness  has not in some parts of the world been sufficiently attended to,  yet the custom is by no means on the decrease; nor can any fear be  entertained, with propriety, that so excellent and so natural an  expedient should ever be suffered to decline, from want of consideration  of its benefits and advantages. But it must be owned, that while bathing  in many countries is resorted to as a matter-of-course affair among all  classes, in England it is in a great measure disregarded by most of the  middle classes, and almost entirely so by those in the lower station of  life, who perhaps require this exercise more than their richer  neighbours.    A medical writer of the present day observes, with some grounds for  complaint, that while \"in almost all countries, both in ancient and  modern times, whether rude or civilized, bathing was a part of the  necessary and everyday business of life, in this country alone, with  all its refinements in the arts which contribute to the happiness or  comfort of man, and with all its improvements in medical science and  jurisprudence, this salutary and luxurious practice is almost entirely  neglected.\"[7] But in many countries, particularly in the east, bathing  is as much resorted to as ever; and its really powerful effects in  invigorating the frame and promoting the porous secretions, (without  which life itself cannot be long continued,) require only to be once  known to be persevered in.    Among the ancients, bathing was far more generally practised than at  the present day. In the city of Alexandria, there were 4,000 public  baths; and the height of refinement in this luxury among the Romans is  almost incredible. In addition to the private baths, with which almost  every house was supplied, public baths were built, sometimes at the  public cost, and often at the expense of private individuals, who  nobly conceived their wealth to be laudably expended in giving each of  their fellow-citizens the means of procuring, free of expense, bodily  cleanliness and comfort. These baths were generally very extensive, and  fitted up with every possible convenience;--the passages and apartments  were paved with marbles of every hue, and the tesselated floors were  adorned with representations of gladiatorial engagements, hunting,  racing, and a variety of subjects from the mythology. In the  _Thermae_ at Rome, ingenuity and magnificence seem exhausted; and  the elegance of the architecture, and the vast range of rooms and  porticos, create in the beholder surprise and admiration, mingled with  feelings of regret for their neglected state. A quadrans (about a  farthing) admitted any one; for the funds bequeathed by the emperors and  others were amply sufficient to provide for the expensive establishments  requisite, without taxing the people beyond their means. Agrippa gave  his baths and gardens to the public, and even assigned estates for their  maintenance. Some of the _Thermae_ were also provided with a variety  of perfumed ointments and oils gratuitously. The chief _Thermae_[8]  were those of Agrippa, Nero, Titus, Domitian, Caracalla, and Diocletian.  Their main building consisted of rooms for swimming and bathing, in  either hot or cold water; others for conversation; and some devoted  to various exercises and athletic amusements. In some assembled large  bodies to hear the lectures of philosophers, or perhaps a composition  of some favourite poet; while the walls were surrounded with statues,  paintings, and literary productions, to suit the diversified taste of  the company.    Eustace describes these _Thermae_ at some length:--\"Repassing the  Aventine Hill, we came to the baths of Antoninus Caracalla, that occupy  part of its declivity, and a considerable portion of the plain between  it and Mons Caeliolus and Mons Caelius. The length of the _Thermae_  was 1,840 feet; breadth, 1,476. At each end were two temples, one to  Apollo and another to Esculapius, as the tutelary deities of a place  sacred to the improvement of the mind, and the health of the body. In  the principal building were, in the first place, a grand circular  vestibule, with four halls on each side, for cold, tepid, warm, and  steam baths;[9] in the centre was an immense square for exercise, when  the weather was unfavourable to it in the open air; beyond it a great  hall, where _one thousand six hundred seats of marble_ were placed  for the convenience of the bathers; at each end of this hall were  libraries. The stucco and paintings, though faintly indeed, are "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15540"],[0,"Across India; Or, Live Boys in the Far East (#2)"],[1,"owner.    \"Once a captain always a captain,\" replied Louis. \"One who has been  a member of Congress is still an 'Honorable,' though his term of  office expired twenty or forty years ago. The worthy commander of the  Guardian-Mother was always called Captain Ringgold in Von Blonk Park and  New York, though he had not been in command of a ship for ten years,\"  argued Louis.    \"That's right; but the circumstances are a little different in my case. In  the first place, I am only eighteen years old, and my brief command was a  very small one, as the world goes. It hardly entitles me to be called  captain after I have ceased to be in command. In charge of the little Maud  I was the happiest young fellow on the Eastern Continent; but I am just as  happy now, for this morning I was formally appointed third officer of the  Guardian-Mother, at the wages paid to Captain Sharp when he had the same  position.\"    \"I congratulate you, Mr. Scott,\" said Louis, grasping the hand of the new  officer, though he had been duly consulted in regard to the appointment the  day before.    \"Permit me to congratulate you also, Mr. Scott,\" added Miss Blanche, as she  extended to him her delicate little hand.    \"Thank you, Miss Woolridge,\" replied the new third officer, raising the  uniform cap he had already donned, and bowing as gracefully as a  dancing-master. \"Thank you with all my heart, Louis. I won't deny that I  was considerably broken up when the Maud was sold; but now I am glad of it,  for it has given me a position that I like better.\"    \"Now, Mr. Scott, what is the run for to-day?\" asked Louis, renewing his  first question.    \"I don't know,\" replied the third officer with a mischievous smile.    \"You don't know!\" exclaimed Louis.    \"I do not, Louis.\"    \"I thought all the officers, including the commander, took the observation,  and worked up the reckoning for the longitude. We got eight bells nearly an  hour ago, and the bulletin must have been posted by this time.\"    \"It was posted some time ago. All the officers work up the reckoning; and I  did so with the others. The commander and I agreed to a second.\"    \"What do you mean by saying you do not know the run?\" demanded Louis.    \"I do know the run; but that was not what you asked me,\" answered Scott  with the same mischievous smile.    \"What did I ask you?\"    \"The first time you asked me all right, and I should have answered you if I  had not felt obliged to switch off and inform you and Miss Woolridge of my  new appointment. The second time you put it you changed the question.\"    \"I changed it?\" queried Louis.    \"You remember that when Mrs. Blossom asked Flix where under the sun he had  been, he replied that he had not been anywhere, as it happened to be in the  evening, when the sun was not overhead.\"    \"A quibble!\" exclaimed Louis, laughing.    \"Granted; but one which was intended to test your information in regard to  a nautical problem. You asked me the second time for the run of to-day for  the last twenty-four hours.\"    \"And that was what I asked you the first time,\" answered Louis.    \"I beg your pardon, but you asked me simply for the run to-day.\"    \"Isn't that the same thing?\"    \"Will you please to tell me how many hours there are in a sea-day?\" asked  Scott, becoming more serious.    \"That depends,\" answered Louis, laughing. \"You have me on the run.\"    \"You will find that the bulletin signed by the first officer gives the run  as 330 miles; but the answer to your second question is 337 miles, about,\"  added the third officer. \"Just here the day is only twenty-three hours and  forty minutes long as we are running; and the faster we go the shorter the  day,\" continued the speaker, who was ciphering all the time on a card.    \"I don't see how that can be,\" interposed Miss Blanche, with one of her  prettiest smiles.    \"There is the lunch-bell; but I shall be very happy to explain the matter  more fully later in the day, Miss Woolridge, unless you prefer that Louis  should do it,\" suggested Scott.    \"I doubt if I could do it, and I should be glad to listen to the  explanation,\" replied Louis, as they descended to the main cabin; for the  new third officer was permitted to retain his place at the table as well as  his state-room.    The commander had suggested that there was likely to be some change of  cabin arrangements; for it was not in accordance with his ideas of right  that the third officer should be admitted to the table, while the first and  second were excluded; and Louis was very desirous that his friend Scott  should remain in the cabin. The repasts on board the steamer were social  occasions, and the party often sat quite an hour at the table, as at the  present luncheon. But as soon as the company left their places, Louis and  Miss Blanche followed the third officer to the promenade deck, to hear the  desired explanation of sea-time.    \"Of course you know how the longitude of the ship is obtained, Miss  Woolridge?\" the young officer began.    \"Papa explained it to me once, but I could not understand it,\" replied the  fair maiden.    \"Then we will explain that first. One of the great circles extending  through the poles is called the prime meridian; and any one may be  selected, though that of Greenwich has been almost universally adopted.  This place is near London. From this prime meridian longitude is  calculated, which means that any given locality is so many degrees east  or west of it. Sandy Hook is in longitude 74 deg., or it is that number of  degrees west of Greenwich. Aden is in 45 deg. east longitude.\"    \"Then you find how many miles it is by multiplying the number of degrees  by 69,\" suggested Miss Blanche.    \"You have forgotten about knots, or sea-miles,\" said Louis.    \"So I have! I should have said multiply by 60,\" added the young lady.    \"That would not do it any better,\" replied Scott.    \"Degrees of latitude are always the same for all practical purposes; but  degrees of longitude are as--        'Variable as the shade    By the light quivering aspen made,'\"    continued the third officer, who was about to say \"as a woman's mind;\"  but he concluded that it was not quite respectful to the lovely being  before him.    \"What a poetical sea-monster you are, Mr. Scott!\" exclaimed Miss Blanche  with a silvery laugh.    \"I won't do so any more,\" Scott protested, and then continued his  explanation. \"Degrees of longitude vary from nothing at the poles, up to  69.07 statute, or 60 geographical or sea-miles, at the equator. We are  now in about 15 deg. north latitude; and a degree of longitude is 66.65  statute miles, or 57.9855 sea-miles, near enough to call it 58. By the  way, Louis, multiply the number of statute miles by .87, and it gives  you the sea-miles. Divide the knots by the same decimal, and it gives  the statute miles.\"    \"I will try to remember that decimal as you have done,\" replied Louis.  \"Now, Mr. Scott, don't open Bowditch's Navigator to us, or talk about  projection,' 'logarithms,' 'Gunter,' and 'inspection;' for I am not capable  of understanding them, for my trigonometry has gone to the weeping  willows.\"    \"Talk to us in English, Mr. Scott,\" laughed Miss Blanche.    \"Let us go up to Conference Hall, where there is a table,\" said the third  officer, as he produced a book he had brought up from his state-room. He  led the way to the promenade, where he spread out a chart in the \"Orient  Guide,\" which had twenty-six diagrams of a clock, one at the foot of every  fifteen degrees of longitude. At this point the commander came upon the  promenade.    \"Formerly the figures on a timepiece in Italy, and perhaps elsewhere, went  up to twenty-four, instead of repeating the numbers up to twelve; and these  diagrams are constructed on that plan,\" continued Scott.    \"An attempt has been made to re-establish this method in our own country. I  learned once from a folder that a certain steamer would leave Detroit at  half-past twenty-two; meaning half-past ten. But the plan was soon  abandoned,\" interposed the captain.    \"Aden, from which we sailed the other day, is in longitude 45 deg. east. Every  degree by meridians is equal to four minutes of clock-time. Multiply the  longitude by four, and the result in minutes is the difference of time  between Greenwich and Aden, 180 minutes, or three hours. When it is noon at  Greenwich, it is three o'clock at Aden, as you see in the diagram before  you.\"    \"Three o'clock in the morning, Mr. Scott?\" queried the commander.    \"In the afternoon, I should have added. Going east the time is faster, and  _vice versa_,\" continued the young officer. \"At our present speed our  clocks must be put about twenty minutes ahead, for a third of an hour has  gone to Davy Jones's locker.\"    \"I understand all that perfectly,\" said Miss Blanche with an air of  triumph.    \"You will be a sea-monster before you get home. The sirens were beautiful,  and sang very sweetly,\" added Scott jocosely.    \"They were wicked, and I don't want to be one. But I do not quite  understand how you found out what time it was at noon to-day,\" added the  young lady.    \"For every degree of longitude sailed there is four minutes' difference of  clock-time,\" Scott proceeded. \"You know that a chronometer is a timepiece  so nicely constructed and cared for, that it practically keeps perfect  time. Meridians are imaginary great circles, and we are always on one of  them. With our sextants we find when the centre of the sun is on the  celestial meridian corresponding to the terrestrial one; and at that  instant it is noon where we are. Then we know what time it is. We compare  the time thus obtained with that indicated by the chronometer, and find a  difference of four hours.\"    \"I see it all!\" exclaimed the fair maiden, as triumphantly as though she  had herself reasoned out the problem. \"Four hours make 240 minutes, and  four minutes to a degree gives 60 deg. as the longitude.    \"Quite correct, Miss Woolridge,\" "]]]
