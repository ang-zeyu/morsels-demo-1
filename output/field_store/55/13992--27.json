DECORATION DAY          See the soldiers, little ones!        Hark the drummers' beat!      See them with their flags and guns        Marching down the street!        Tattered flags from out the wars,        Let us follow these      To the little stripes and stars        Twinkling through the trees.        Watch them waving through the grass        Where the heroes sleep!      Thither gently let us pass        On this day we keep.        Let us bring our blossoms, too,        All our gardens grow;      Lilacs honey-sweet with dew,        And the lilies' snow.        Every posy of the May,        Every bloomy stem,      Every bud that breaks to-day        Gather now for them.        Lay the lilies o'er them thus,        Lovingly, for so      Down they laid their lives for us,        Long and long ago.        Heap above them bud and bough;        Softly, ere we cease,      God, we pray Thee, gently now        Fold them in Thy peace!          CHU-CHU CARS          Turn the chairs down in a row      Each behind the other, so;      _Chu-chu! Chu-chu!_ there they are,      Passenger and baggage-car,      _Chu-chu-chu!_ the Morris chair      Is the engine puffing there,      _Chu-chu! Chu-chu! Ting-a-ling!_      Don't you hear its big bell ring?      All aboard! Jump on! if you      Want to take this train. _Chu-chu!!_      Off we start now, rushing fast      Through the fields and valleys, past      Noisy cities, over bridges,      Hills and plains and mountain ridges,      _Chu-chu! Chu-chu! Chu-chu-chu!!_      At such speed it must be true      Since we started we have come      Most a million miles from home!      Jump off, some one! Quick! and go      To the pantry, for, you know,      We must have the cookie-jar      For our Pullman dining-car!          FAIRY RINGS          Softly in the gloaming        Flitting through the vale,      Fairy folk are roaming        Over hill and dale.        Pixies in the hollow,        Elves upon the height,      Let us follow, follow        Through the paling light.        Follow, all unbidden,        To the grassy glade      Wrapped around and hidden        In the forest shade.        Hark the elfin tinkle        Of their little lutes!      Mark the golden twinkle        Of their fairy flutes!    [Illustration: FAIRY RINGS]        See them dancing, dancing,        While the silver moon      Tips their swiftly glancing        Little silver shoon!        Tripping, tripping lightly,        Where their footprints fall,      Look! the grass is brightly        Growing green and tall!        Springing close, unbroken,        In a fairy ring,      For to-morrow's token        Of their frolicking!          THE FIREFLY          Flash and flicker and fly away,        Trailing light as you flutter far,      Are you a lamp for the fairies, say?        Or a flake of fire from a falling star?          A RAIN SONG                    Tinkle, tinkle,                  Lightly fall        On the peach buds, pink and small;      Tip the tiny grass, and twinkle        On the clover, green and tall.                  Tinkle, tinkle,--                  Faster now,        Little rain-drops, smite and sprinkle      Cherry-bloom and apple-bough!      Pelt the elms, and show them how                You can dash!                  And splash! splash! splash!      While the thunder rolls and mutters,        And the lightnings flash and flash!                Then eddy into curls                Of a million misty swirls,      And thread the air with silver, and embroider it with pearls!        And patter, patter, patter      To a quicker time, and clatter        On the streaming window-pane;                Rain, rain,                  On the leaves,                    And the eaves,        And the turning weather-vane!        Rush in torrents from the tip      Of the gable-peak, and drip        In the garden-bed, and fill          All the cuckoo-cups, and pour                More and more        In the tulip-bowls, and still                  Overspill        In a crystal tide until        Every yellow daffodil      Is flooded to its golden rim, and brimming o'er and o'er!        Then as gently as the low        Muffled whir of robin wings,        Or a sweep of silver strings,                  Even so,          Take your airy April flight          Through the merry April light,      And melt into a mist of rainy music as you go!          FAIRIES          Grandfather says that sometimes,        When stars are twinkling and      A new moon shines, there come times        When folks see fairy-land!        So when there's next a new moon,        I mean to watch all night!      Grandfather says a blue moon        Is best for fairy light,        And in a peach-bloom, maybe,        If I look I shall see      A little fairy baby        No bigger than a bee!          THE LITTLE FIR-TREES          Hey! little evergreens,        Sturdy and strong!      Summer and autumn time        Hasten along;      Harvest the sunbeams, then,        Bind them in sheaves,      Range them, and change them        To tufts of green leaves.      Delve in the mellow mold,        Far, far below,              And so,        Little evergreens, grow!              Grow, grow!      Grow, little evergreens, grow!        Up, up so airily        To the blue sky,      Lift up your leafy tips        Stately and high;      Clasp tight your tiny cones,        Tawny and brown;      By and by, buffeting        Rains will pelt down;      By and by, bitterly        Chill winds will blow;              And so,        Little evergreens, grow!              Grow, grow!      Grow, little evergreens, grow!        Gather all uttermost        Beauty, because,--      Hark, till I tell it now!        How Santa Claus,      Out of the northern land,        Over the seas,      Soon shall come seeking you,        Evergreen trees!      Seek you with reindeer soon,        Over the snow;              And so,        Little evergreens, grow!              Grow, grow!      Grow, little evergreens, grow!        What if the maples flare        Flaunting and red,      You shall wear waxen white        Tapers instead!      What if now, otherwhere,        Birds are beguiled,      You shall yet nestle        The little Christ-child!      Ah! the strange splendor        The fir-trees shall know!              And so,        Little evergreens, grow!              Grow, grow!      Grow, little evergreens, grow!          THE WREN-HOUSE          Yesterday I took my saw        And some bits of wood,      And I made a little house        Nicely as I could.        I put on a mossy-green        Little pointed roof,      And I cut a tiny door        That is pussy-proof.        For I hope some little wrens        To our yard will come      And will choose my little house        For their little home.        I shall hang it in the boughs        Of the apple-tree,      And I'm sure as rent for it        They will sing to me!          THE BABY'S RIDE          Chee! Chee! Chickadee!

Apple-buds, apple-buds, scornful and too        Vain of your loveliness, stay where you are!

At a subsequent period the sign and the event  were separated from one another in literature, and had the annals of  Sargon been a later compilation, in their case also the separation would  assuredly have been made. That, on the contrary, the annals have the  form which they could have assumed and ought to have assumed only at  the beginning of contemporaneous Babylonian history, is to me a strong  testimony in favour of their genuineness.    It may be added that Babylonian seal-cylinders have been found in  Cyprus, one of which is of the age of Sargon of Accad, its style and  workmanship being the same as that of the cylinder figured in vol. iii.  p. 96, while the other, though of later date, belonged to a person  who describes himself as \"the servant of the deified Naram-Sin.\" Such  cylinders may, of course, have been brought to the island in later  times; but when we remember that a characteristic object of prehistoric  Cypriote art is an imitation of the seal-cylinder of Chaldsea, their  discovery cannot be wholly an accident.    Professor Maspero has brought his facts up to so recent a date that  there is very little to add to what he has written. Since his  manuscript was in type, however, a few additions have been made to our  Assyriological knowledge. A fresh examination of the Babylonian dynastic  tablet has led Professor Delitzsch to make some alterations in the  published account of what Professor Maspero calls the ninth dynasty.  According to Professor Delitzsch, the number of kings composing the  dynasty is stated on the tablet to be twenty-one, and not thirty-one as  was formerly read, and the number of lost lines exactly corresponds with  this figure. The first of the kings reigned thirty-six years, and he  had a predecessor belonging to the previous dynasty whose name has been  lost. There would consequently have been two Elamite usurpers instead of  one.    I would further draw attention to an interesting text, published by  Mr. Strong in the _Babylonian and Oriental Record_, which I believe to  contain the name of a king who belonged to the legendary dynasties of  Chaldaea. This is Samas-natsir, who is coupled with Sargon of Accad and  other early monarchs in one of the lists. The legend, if I interpret it  rightly, states that \"Elam shall be altogether given to Samas-natsir;\"  and the same prince is further described as building Nippur and Dur-ilu,  as King of Babylon and as conqueror both of a certain Baldakha and of  Khumba-sitir, \"the king of the cedar-forest.\" It will be remembered that  in the Epic of Gil-games, Khumbaba also is stated to have been the lord  of the \"cedar-forest.\"    But of new discoveries and facts there is a constant supply, and it  is impossible for the historian to keep pace with them. Even while the  sheets of his work are passing through the press, the excavator, the  explorer, and the decipherer are adding to our previous stores of  knowledge. In Egypt, Mr. de Morgan's unwearied energy has raised as it  were out of the ground, at Kom Ombo, a vast and splendidly preserved  temple, of whose existence we had hardly dreamed; has discovered  twelfth-dynasty jewellery at Dahshur of the most exquisite workmanship,  and at Meir and Assiut has found in tombs of the sixth dynasty painted  models of the trades and professions of the day, as well as fighting  battalions of soldiers, which, for freshness and lifelike reality,  contrast favourably with the models which come from India to-day. In  Babylonia, the American Expedition, under Mr. Haines, has at Niffer  unearthed monuments of older date than those of Sargon of Accad. Nor  must I forget to mention the lotiform column found by Mr. de Morgan in  a tomb of the Old Empire at Abusir, or the interesting discovery made by  Mr. Arthur Evans of seals and other objects from the prehistoric sites  of Krete and other parts of the AEgean, inscribed with hieroglyphic  characters which reveal a new system of writing that must at one time  have existed by the side of the Hittite hieroglyphs, and may have had  its origin in the influence exercised by Egypt on the peoples of the  Mediterranean in the age of the twelfth dynasty.    In volumes IV., V., and VI. we find ourselves in the full light of an  advanced culture. The nations of the ancient East are no longer each  pursuing an isolated existence, and separately developing the seeds of  civilization and culture on the banks of the Euphrates and the Nile.  Asia and Africa have met in mortal combat. Babylonia has carried its  empire to the frontiers of Egypt, and Egypt itself has been held in  bondage by the Hyksos strangers from Asia. In return, Egypt has driven  back the wave of invasion to the borders of Mesopotamia, has substituted  an empire of its own in Syria for that of the Babylonians, and has  forced the Babylonian king to treat with its Pharaoh on equal terms.  In the track of war and diplomacy have come trade and commerce; Western  Asia is covered with roads, along which the merchant and the courier  travel incessantly, and the whole civilised world of the Orient is knit  together in a common literary culture and common commercial interests.    The age of isolation has thus been succeeded by an age of intercourse,  partly military and antagonistic, partly literary and peaceful.  Professor Maspero paints for us this age of intercourse, describes  its rise and character, its decline and fall. For the unity of Eastern  civilization was again shattered. The Hittites descended from the ranges  of the Taurus upon the Egyptian province of Northern Syria, and cut off  the Semites of the west from those of the east. The Israelites poured  over the Jordan out of Edom and Moab, and took possession of Canaan,  while Babylonia itself, for so many centuries the ruling power of the  Oriental world, had to make way for its upstart rival Assyria. The old  imperial powers were exhausted and played out, and it needed time before  the new forces which were to take their place could acquire sufficient  strength for their work.    As usual, Professor Maspero has been careful to embody in his history  the very latest discoveries and information. Notice, it will be found,  has been taken even of the _stela_ of Meneptah, recently disinterred by  Professor Petrie, on which the name of the Israelites is engraved.  At Elephantine, I found, a short time since, on a granite boulder, an  inscription of Khufuankh--whose sarcophagus of red granite is one of  the most beautiful objects in the Gizeh Museum--which carries back the  history of the island to the age of the pyramid-builders of the fourth  dynasty. The boulder was subsequently concealed under the southern side  of the city-wall, and as fragments of inscribed papyrus coeval with the  sixth dynasty have been discovered in the immediate neighbourhood, on  one of which mention is made of \"this domain\" of Pepi II., it would seem  that the town of Elephantine must have been founded between the period  of the fourth dynasty and that of the sixth. Manetho is therefore  justified in making the fifth and sixth dynasties of Elephantine origin.    It is in Babylonia, however, that the most startling discoveries have  been made. At Tello, M. de Sarzec has found a library of more than  thirty thousand tablets, all neatly arranged, piled in order one on the  other, and belonging to the age of Gudea (b.c. 2700). Many more tablets  of an early date have been unearthed at Abu-Habba (Sippara) and Jokha  (Isin) by Dr. Scheil, working for the Turkish government. But the most  important finds have been at Niffer, the ancient Nippur, in Northern  Babylonia, where the American expedition has brought to a close its long  work of systematic excavation. Here Mr. Haynes has dug down to the very  foundations of the great temple of El-lil, and the chief historical  results of his labours have been published by Professor Hilprecht (in  _The Babylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania_, vol. i.  pl. 2, 1896).    About midway between the summit and the bottom of the mound, Mr. Haynes  laid bare a pavement constructed of huge bricks stamped with the names  of Sargon of Akkad and his son Naram-Sin. He found also the ancient wall  of the city, which had been built by Naram-Sin, 13.7 metres wide. The  _debris_ of ruined buildings which lies below the pavement of Sargon  is as much as 9.25 metres in depth, while that above it, the topmost  stratum of which brings us down to the Christian era, is only 11 metres  in height. We may form some idea from this of the enormous age to which  the history of Babylonian culture and writing reaches back. In fact,  Professor Hilprecht quotes with approval Mr. Haynes's words: \"We must  cease to apply the adjective 'earliest' to the time of Sargon, or to any  age or epoch within a thousand years of his advanced civilization.\" \"The  golden age of Babylonian history seems to include the reign of Sargon  and of Ur-Gur.\"    Many of the inscriptions which belong to this remote age of human  culture have been published by Professor Hilprecht. Among them is a long  inscription, in 132 lines, engraved on multitudes of large stone  vases presented to the temple of El-lil by a certain Lugal-zaggisi.  Lugal-zaggisi was the son of Ukus, the _patesi_ or high priest of the  \"Land of the Bow,\" as Mesopotamia, with its Bedawin inhabitants, was  called. He not only conquered Babylonia, then known as Kengi, \"the land  of canals and reeds,\" but founded an empire which extended from the  Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. This was centuries before Sargon  of Akkad followed in his footsteps. Erech became the capital of  Lugal-zaggisi's empire, and doubtless received at this time its Sumerian  title"]]]
