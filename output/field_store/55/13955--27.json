Her first idea was that  she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she  was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.    [Illustration]    Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way  off, and she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it  was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.    \"Would it be of any use, now,\" thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should think very  likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no harm in trying.\" So she  began, \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired  of swimming about here, O Mouse!\" The Mouse looked at her rather  inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but  it said nothing.    \"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought Alice. \"I dare say it's  a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\" So she began  again: \"Ou est ma chatte?\" which was the first sentence in her French  lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to  quiver all over with fright. \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice  hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. \"I quite  forgot you didn't like cats.\"    \"Not like cats!\" cried the Mouse in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would  _you_ like cats, if you were me?\"    \"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone; \"don't be angry  about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you'd  take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a dear,  quiet thing.\" The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it  must be really offended. \"We won't talk about her any more, if you'd  rather not.\"    \"We, indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its  tail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_  cats--nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!\"    [Illustration: Alice at the Mad Tea Party.]    \"I won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of  conversation. \"Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs? There is such a nice  little dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the  rats and--oh, dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. \"I'm afraid I've  offended it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as  it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.    So she called softly after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we  won't talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the  Mouse heard this, it turned 'round and swam slowly back to her; its face  was quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, \"Let us get to  the shore and then I'll tell you my history and you'll understand why it  is I hate cats and dogs.\"    It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the  birds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo,  a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the  way and the whole party swam to the shore.    [Illustration]          III--A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE      They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the  birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close  to them, and all dripping wet, cross and uncomfortable.    [Illustration]    The first question, of course, was how to get dry again. They had a  consultation about this and after a few minutes, it seemed quite natural  to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had  known them all her life.    At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of some authority among  them, called out, \"Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I'll_ soon  make you dry enough!\" They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with  the Mouse in the middle.    \"Ahem!\" said the Mouse with an important air. \"Are you all ready? This  is the driest thing I know. Silence all 'round, if you please! 'William  the Conqueror, whose cause was favored by the pope, was soon submitted  to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much  accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of  Mercia and Northumbria'--\"    \"Ugh!\" said the Lory, with a shiver.    \"--'And even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it  advisable'--\"    \"Found _what_?\" said the Duck.    \"Found _it_,\" the Mouse replied rather crossly; \"of course, you know  what 'it' means.\"    \"I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\" said the  Duck; \"it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the  archbishop find?\"    The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \"'--found  it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the  crown.'--How are you getting on now, my dear?\" it continued, turning to  Alice as it spoke.    \"As wet as ever,\" said Alice in a melancholy tone; \"it doesn't seem to  dry me at all.\"    \"In that case,\" said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \"I move that  the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic  remedies--\"    \"Speak English!\" said the Eaglet. \"I don't know the meaning of half  those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!\"    \"What I was going to say,\" said the Dodo in an offended tone, \"is that  the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\"    \"What _is_ a Caucus-race?\" said Alice.    [Illustration]    \"Why,\" said the Dodo, \"the best way to explain it is to do it.\" First it  marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, and then all the party  were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \"One, two,  three and away!\" but they began running when they liked and left off  when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.  However, when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite  dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out, \"The race is over!\" and they  all crowded 'round it, panting and asking, \"But who has won?\"    This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought.  At last it said, \"_Everybody_ has won, and _all_ must have prizes.\"    \"But who is to give the prizes?\" quite a chorus of voices asked.    \"Why, _she_, of course,\" said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one  finger; and the whole party at once crowded 'round her, calling out, in  a confused way, \"Prizes! Prizes!\"    Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand into her  pocket and pulled out a box of comfits (luckily the salt-water had not  got into it) and handed them 'round as prizes. There was exactly one  a-piece, all 'round.    The next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and  confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste  theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.  However, it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and  begged the Mouse to tell them something more.    \"You promised to tell me your history, you know,\" said Alice, \"and why  it is you hate--C and D,\" she added in a whisper, half afraid that it  would be offended again.    \"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\" said the Mouse, turning to Alice and  sighing.    \"It _is_ a long tail, certainly,\" said Alice, looking down with wonder  at the Mouse's tail, \"but why do you call it sad?\" And she kept on  puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the  tale was something like this:--        \"Fury said to        a mouse, That           he met in the              house, 'Let                us both go                  to law: _I_                   will prosecute                 _you_.--                   Come, I'll                take no denial:               We             must have          the trial;       For really      this morning      I've      nothing      to do.'      Said the       mouse to        the cur,         'Such a          trial, dear             sir, With                 no jury                  or judge,                     would                    be wasting                  our               breath.'           'I'll be          judge,         I'll be        jury,'       said      cunning      old       Fury;        'I'll         try          the           whole            cause,            and           condemn         you to      death.'\"    \"You are not attending!\" said the Mouse to Alice, severely. \"What are  you thinking of?\"    \"I beg your pardon,\" said Alice very humbly, \"you had got to the fifth  bend, I think?\"    \"You insult me by talking such nonsense!\" said the Mouse, getting up and  walking away.    \"Please come back and finish your story!\" Alice called after it. And the  others all joined in chorus, \"Yes, please do!\" But the Mouse only shook  its head impatiently and walked a little quicker.    \"I wish I had Dinah, our cat, here!\" said Alice. This caused a  remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at  once, and a Canary called out in a trembling voice, to its children,  \"Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!\" On various  pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone.    \"I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah! Nobody seems "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19036"],[0,"Germany and the Germans from an American Point of View (#2)"],[1,"by gaining complete control,  a control in more powerful hands to-day than ever before.    The second, called the Eastern or Austrian March, was situated in the  basin of the Danube. These two great states were formed in lands that  had ceased to be German and had become Slav or Finnish territory. The  fighting appetite of the German tribes, and the spirit of chivalry  later, which had drawn men in other days in France to the East, in  Spain against the Moors, in Normandy against England, were offered an  opportunity and an outlet in Germany, by forays and fighting against  the Finns and Slays.    Out of the conquest and settlement of these territories grew, what we  know to-day, as the German Empire and the Austrian Empire. Out of  their margraves, who were at first sentinel officers guarding the  outer boundaries of the empire, and mere nominees of the Emperor, have  developed the Emperor of Germany and the Emperor of Austria, the one  ruling over the most powerful nation, the other the head of the most  exclusive court, in Europe.    When a man becomes a power in the world, these days, our first impulse  is to ask about his ancestry. Who were his father and his mother; what  and who were his grandfathers and grandmothers, and who were their  forebears. Where did they come from, what was the climate; did they  live by the sea, or in the mountains, or in the plains. We are at once  hot on the trail of his success. Be he an American, we wish to know  whether his people came from Holland, from France, from England, or  from Belgium; where did they settle, in New England, in New York, or  in the South. We no longer accept ability as a miracle, but  investigate it as an evolution. If the man be great enough, cities vie  with each other to claim him as their child; he acquires an Homeric  versatility in cradles.    Whatever one may think of William II of Germany, he is just now the  predominating figure in Europe, if not in the world. This must be our  excuse for a word or two concerning the race from which came his  twenty-fifth lineal ancestor.    It is exactly five hundred years since his present empire was founded  in the sandy plains about the Elbe, and a thousand years before that  brings us to the dim dawn of any historical knowledge whatever about  the Germans. When the Cimbrians and Teutonians came into contact with  the Romans, in 113 B. C., is the beginning of all things for these  people. In that year the inhabitants of the north of Italy awoke one  morning to find a swarm of blue-eyed, light-haired, long-limbed  strangers coming down from the Alps upon them. The younger and more  light-hearted warriors came tobogganing down the snow-covered  mountain-sides on their shields. They had been crowded out of what is  now Switzerland, and called themselves, though they were much alike in  appearance, the Cimbri and the Teutones. They defeated the Roman  armies sent against them, and, turning to the south and west, went on  their way along the north shores of the Mediterranean into what is now  France. They had no history of their own. Tacitus writes that they  could neither read nor write: \"Literarum secreta viri pariter ac  feminae ignorant.\" Very little is to be found concerning them in the  Roman writers. The books of Pliny which treated of this time are lost.  It was toward the middle of the century before Christ that Caesar  advanced to the frontier of what may be called Germany. He met and  conquered there these men of the blood who were to conquer Rome, and  to carry on the name under the title of the Holy Roman Empire. Caesar  met the ancestors of those who were to be Caesars, and with an eye on  Roman politics, wrote the \"Commentaries,\" which were really  autobiographical messages, with the Germans as a text and an excuse.    Tacitus, born just about one hundred years after the death of Caesar,  and who had access to the lost works of Pliny, was a moralist  historian and a warm friend of the Germans. Over their shoulders he  rapped the manners and morals of his own countrymen. \"Vice is not  treated by the Germans\" (German, the etymologists say, is composed of  Ger, meaning spear or lance, and Man, meaning chief or lord; Deutsch,  or Teutsch, comes from the Gothic word Thiudu, meaning nation, and a  Deutscher, or Teutscher, meant one belonging to the nation), he tells  his countrymen, \"as a subject of raillery, nor is the profligacy of  corrupting and being corrupted called the fashion of the age.\" With  Rooseveltian enthusiasm he writes that the Germans consider it a crime  \"to set limits to population, by rearing up only a certain number of  children and destroying the rest.\"    The republicanism of Europe and America had its roots in this Teutonic  civilization. \"No man dictates to the assembly; he may persuade but  cannot command. When anything is advanced not agreeable to the people,  they reject it with a general murmur. If the proposition pleases, they  brandish their javelins. This is their highest and most honorable mark  of applause; they assent in a military manner, and praise by the sound  of their arms,\" continues our author.    The great historian of the Roman historians, and of Rome, Gibbon,  lends his authority to this praise of Tacitus in the sentence: \"The  most civilized nations of modern Europe issued from the woods of  Germany; and in the rude institutions of those barbarians we may still  distinguish the original principles of our present laws and manners.\"    Rome, which was not only a city, a nation, an empire, but a religion;  Rome, which replied to a suggestion that the people of Latium should  be admitted to citizenship, \"Thou hast heard, O Jupiter, the impious  words that have come from this man's mouth. Canst thou tolerate, O  Jupiter, that a foreigner should come to sit in the sacred temple as a  senator, as a consul?\" Rome welcomed later the barbarians from the  woods of Germany not only as citizens and consuls, but as emperors;  and their descendants rule the world.    It was no Capuan training that finally distilled itself in a  Charlemagne, an Otho, a Luther, a Frederick the Great, and a Bismarck;  in an Alfred, a William the Conqueror, a Cromwell, a Clive, a Rhodes,  or a Gordon; in a Washington, a Lincoln, a Grant, a Jackson, and a  Lee.    Beyond the certified beyond, we see dimly through the mists of  history, hosts of men marching, ever marching from the east, spreading  some toward Norway and Sweden, some skirting the Baltic Sea to the  south; driving their cattle before them, and learning the arts of  peace and war, and self-government, from the harsh school-masters of  pressing needs and tyrannical circumstances, the only teachers that  confer degrees of permanent value. They become fishermen and small  landholders in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. \"Jeudi,\" or Jupiter's day,  becomes their god Thor's day, or Thursday; \"Mardi,\" or Mars's day, is  their Tiu's day, or Tuesday; \"Mercredi,\" or Mercury's day, is Odin's  or Woden's day, or Wednesday.    These men trained to solitude in small bands, owing to the  geographical exigencies of their northern country, become the founders  of the particularist or individualistic nations, Great Britain and the  United States among others. Those who had gone south, driven by  pressure from behind, follow the Danube to the north and west, find  the Rhine, and push on into what is now southwestern Europe.    It is worth noting that the Rhine and the Danube have their sources  near together, and form a line of water from the North Sea to the  Black Sea, a significant line in Europe from the beginning down to  this day. This line of water divides not only lands but nations,  manners, customs, and even speech, and what we call the North, and  what we call the South, may be said to be, with negligible exceptions,  what is north and what is south of those two rivers. It is and always  has been the Mason and Dixon's line of Europe.    All of these peoples mould their institutions, from the habits and  customs forced upon them by their surroundings. The members of the  tribe of the Suevi, now Swabians, were not allowed to hold fixed  landed possessions, but were forced to exchange with each other from  time to time, so that no one should become wedded to the soil and grow  rich thereby. Readers of history will remember, that Lycurgus  attempted similar legislation among the Spartans, hoping thus to keep  them simple and hardy, and fit for war.    How many hundreds of years, these various tribes were working out  their rude political and domestic laws, no man knows. The imaginative  historian pushes his way through the mists, and sees that the tribes  who lived in the Scandinavian peninsula were forced by their cramped  territory to become fishermen and sailors, and cultivators of small  areas of land, accustomed therefore to rule themselves in small  groups, and hence independent and markedly individualist. Such  historians divide even these rude tribes sharply between the  patriarchal and the particularist. The particularist commune developed  from the estate which was self-sufficient, isolated, and independent.  When they were associated together it was for special and limited  purposes, so that independence might be infringed upon to the least  possible extent. The patriarchal commune, on the other hand, proceeded  from the communal family which provided everything for everybody. It  was a general and compulsory partnership, monopolizing every kind of  business that might arise. The particularist group then, and their  moral and political descendants now, strive to organize public  authority, and public life in such a way, that they are distinctly  subordinate to private and individual independence. In the one the  Emperor is the father of the family -- the Russian Emperor is still  called \"Little Father\" -- the independence of each member of the family  is swallowed up in the complete authority of the head of the national"]]]
