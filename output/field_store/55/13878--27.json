FOOTNOTES:    [1] If your haversack-flap has a strap which buckles down upon the  front, you can run the strap through the cup-handle before buckling; or  you can buy a rein-hitch at the saddlery-hardware shop, and fasten it  wherever most convenient to carry the cup.          CHAPTER II.    SMALL PARTIES TRAVELLING AFOOT AND CAMPING.      We will consider separately the many ways in which a party can spend a  summer vacation; and first we will start into wild and uninhabited  regions, afoot, carrying on our backs blankets, a tent, frying-pan,  food, and even a shot-gun and fishing-tackle. This is _very_ hard work  for a young man to follow daily for any length of time; and, although it  sounds romantic, yet let no party of young people think they can find  pleasure in it many days; for if they meet with a reverse, have much  rainy weather, or lose their way, some one will almost surely be taken  sick, and all sport will end.    If you have a mountain to climb, or a short trip of only a day or two,  I would not discourage you from going in this way; but for any extended  tour it is too severe a strain upon the physical powers of one not  accustomed to similar hard work.      AFOOT.--CAMPING OUT.    A second and more rational way, especially for small parties, is that of  travelling afoot in the roads of a settled country, carrying a blanket,  tent, food, and cooking-utensils; cooking your meals, and doing all the  work yourselves. If you do not care to travel fast, to go far, or to  spend much money, this is a fine way. But let me caution you first of  all about overloading, for this is the most natural thing to do. It is  the tendency of human nature to accumulate, and you will continually  pick up things on your route that you will wish to take along; and it  will require your best judgment to start with the least amount of  luggage, and to keep from adding to it.    You have probably read that a soldier carries a musket, cartridges,  blanket, overcoat, rations, and other things, weighing forty or fifty  pounds. You will therefore say to yourself, \"I can carry twenty.\" Take  twenty pounds, then, and carry it around for an hour, and see how you  like it. Very few young men who read this book will find it possible to  _enjoy_ themselves, and carry more than twenty pounds a greater distance  than ten miles a day, for a week. To carry even the twenty pounds ten  miles a day is hard work to many, although every summer there are  parties who do their fifteen, twenty, and more miles daily, with big  knapsacks on their backs; but it is neither wise, pleasant, nor  healthful, to the average young man, to do this.    Let us cut down our burden to the minimum, and see how much it will be.  First of all, you must take a rubber blanket or a light rubber  coat,--something that will surely shed water, and keep out the dampness  of the earth when slept on. You must have something of this sort,  whether afoot, horseback, with a wagon, or in permanent camp.[2]    For carrying your baggage you will perhaps prefer a knapsack, though  many old soldiers are not partial to that article. There are also for  sale broad straps and other devices as substitutes for the knapsack.  Whatever you take, be sure it has broad straps to go over your  shoulders: otherwise you will be constantly annoyed from their cutting  and chafing you.    You can dispense with the knapsack altogether in the same way that  soldiers do,--by rolling up in your blanket whatever you have to carry.  You will need to take some pains in this, and perhaps call a comrade to  assist you. Lay out the blanket flat, and roll it as tightly as possible  without folding it, enclosing the other baggage[3] as you roll; then tie  it in a number of places to prevent unrolling, and the shifting about of  things inside; and finally tie or strap together the two ends, and throw  the ring thus made over the shoulder, and wear it as you do the strap of  the haversack,--diagonally across the body.    [Illustration]    The advantages of the roll over the knapsack are important. You save the  two and a half pounds weight; the roll is very much easier to the  shoulder, and is easier shifted from one shoulder to the other, or taken  off; and you can ease the burden a little with your hands. It feels  bulky at first, but you soon become used to it. On the whole, you will  probably prefer the roll to the knapsack; but if you carry much weight  you will very soon condemn whatever way you carry it, and wish for a  change.    A haversack is almost indispensable in all pedestrian tours. Even if you  have your baggage in a wagon, it is best to wear one, or some sort of a  small bag furnished with shoulder straps, so that you can carry a lunch,  writing materials, guide-book, and such other small articles as you  constantly need. You can buy a haversack at the stores where sportsmen's  outfits are sold; or you can make one of enamel-cloth or rubber  drilling, say eleven inches deep by nine wide, with a strap of the same  material neatly doubled and sewed together, forty to forty-five inches  long, and one and three-quarters inches wide. Cut the back piece about  nineteen inches long, so as to allow for a flap eight inches long to  fold over the top and down the front. Sew the strap on the upper corners  of the back piece, having first sewed a facing inside, to prevent its  tearing out the back.      WOOLLEN BLANKET.    Next in the order of necessities is a woollen blanket,--a good stout  one, rather than the light or flimsy one that you may think of taking.  In almost all of the Northern States the summer nights are apt to be  chilly; while in the mountainous regions, and at the seaside, they are  often fairly cold. A lining of cotton drilling will perhaps make a thin  blanket serviceable. This lining does not need to be quite as long nor  as wide as the blanket, since the ends and edges of the blanket are used  to tuck under the sleeper. One side of the lining should be sewed to the  blanket, and the other side and the ends buttoned; or you may leave off  the end buttons. You can thus dry it, when wet, better than if it were  sewed all around. You can lay what spare clothing you have, and your  day-clothes, between the lining and blanket, when the night is very  cold.    In almost any event, you will want to carry a spare shirt; and in cold  weather you can put this on, when you will find that a pound of shirt is  as warm as two pounds of overcoat.    If you take all I advise, you will not absolutely need an overcoat, and  can thus save carrying a number of pounds.    The tent question we will discuss elsewhere; but you can hardly do with  less than a piece of shelter-tent. If you have a larger kind, the man  who carries it must have some one to assist him in carrying his own  stuff, so that the burden may be equalized.    If you take tent-poles, they will vex you sorely, and tempt you to throw  them away: if you do not carry them, you will wonder when night comes  why you did not take them. If your tent is not large, so that you can  use light ash poles, I would at least start with them, unless the tent  is a \"shelter,\" as poles for this can be easily cut.    You will have to carry a hatchet; and the kind known as the axe-pattern  hatchet is better than the shingling-hatchet for driving tent-pins. I  may as well caution you here not to try to drive tent-pins with the flat  side of the axe or hatchet, for it generally ends in breaking the  handle,--quite an accident when away from home.    For cooking-utensils on a trip like that we are now proposing, you will  do well to content yourself with a frying-pan, coffee-pot, and perhaps a  tin pail; you can do wonders at cooking with these.    We will consider the matter of cooking and food elsewhere; but the main  thing now is to know beforehand where you are going, and to learn if  there are houses and shops on the route. Of course you must have food;  but, if you have to carry three or four days' rations in your haversack,  I fear that many of my young friends will fail to see the pleasure of  their trip. Yet carry them if you must: do not risk starvation,  whatever you do. Also remember to always have something in your  haversack, no matter how easy it is to buy what you want.    I have now enumerated the principal articles of weight that a party must  take on a walking-tour when they camp out, and cook as they go. If the  trip is made early or late in the season, you must take more clothing.  If you are gunning, your gun, &c., add still more weight. Every one will  carry towel, soap, comb, and toothbrush.    Then there is a match-safe (which should be air-tight, or the matches  will soon spoil), a box of salve, the knives, fork, spoon, dipper,  portfolio, paper, Testament, &c. Every man also has something in  particular that \"he wouldn't be without for any thing.\"[4]    There should also be in every party a clothes brush, mosquito-netting,  strings, compass, song-book, guide-book, and maps, which should be  company property.    I have supposed every one to be dressed about as usual, and have made  allowance only for extra weight; viz.,--              Rubber blanket                                2-1/2 pounds.            Stout woollen blanket and lining              4-1/2   \"            Knapsack, haversack, and canteen              4       \"            Drawers, spare shirt,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17579"],[0,"The History of Napoleon Buonaparte (#2)"],[1," to escape. His careless attire, and his partiality  for a pretty little girl in the neighbourhood, were ridiculed together  in a song which his playmates used to shout after him in the streets of  Ajaccio:        \"Napoleone di mezza calzetta      Fa l'amore a Giacominetta.\"[3]    His superiority of character was early felt. An aged relation, Lucien  Buonaparte, Archdeacon of Ajaccio, called the young people about his  death-bed to take farewell and bless them: \"You, Joseph,\" said the  expiring man, \"are the eldest; but Napoleon is the head of his family.  Take care to remember my words.\" Napoleon took excellent care that they  should not be forgotten. He began with beating his elder brother into  subjection.    From his earliest youth he chose arms for his profession. When he was  about seven years old (1776) his father was, through Marboeuff's  patronage, sent to France as one of a deputation from the Corsican  _noblesse_ to King Louis XVI.; and Napoleon, for whom the count had also  procured admission into the military school of Brienne, accompanied him.  After seeing part of Italy, and crossing France, they reached Paris; and  the boy was soon established in his school, where at first everything  delighted him, though, forty years afterwards, he said he should never  forget the bitter parting with his mother ere he set out on his travels.  He spoke only Italian when he reached Brienne; but soon mastered French.  His progress in Latin, and in literature generally, attracted no great  praise; but in every study likely to be of service to the future  soldier, he distinguished himself above his contemporaries. Of the  mathematical tutors accordingly he was a great favourite. One of the  other teachers having condemned him for some offence or neglect to wear  a course woollen dress on a particular day, and dine on his knees at the  door of the refectory, the boy's haughty spirit swelling under this  dishonour, brought on a sudden vomiting, and a strong fit of hysterics.  The mathematical master passing by, said they did not understand what  they were dealing with, and released him. He cared little for common  pastimes; but his love for such as mimicked war was extreme; and the  skill of his fortifications, reared of turf, or of snow, according to  the season, and the address and pertinacity with which he conducted  their defence, attracted the admiration of all observers. Napoleon was  poor and all but a foreigner[4] among the French youth, and underwent  many mortifications from both causes. His temper was reserved and proud;  he had few friends--no bosom-companion; he lived by himself, and among  his books and maps. M. Bourienne, whose friendship for him commenced  thus early, says--\"Buonaparte was noticeable at Brienne for his Italian  complexion, the keenness of his look, and the tone of his conversation  both with masters and comrades. There was almost always a dash of  bitterness in what he said. He had very little of the disposition that  leads to attachments; which I can only attribute to the misfortunes of  his family every since his birth, and the impression which the conquest  of his country had made on his early years.\" One day, at dinner, the  principal of the school happened to say something slightingly of Paoli.  \"He was a great man,\" cried young Buonaparte, \"he loved his country; and  I shall never forgive my father, who had been his adjutant, for  consenting to the union of Corsica with France. He ought to have  followed the fortunes of Paoli.\"    There is reason to believe that the levity and haughtiness with which  some of the young French gentlemen at this seminary conducted themselves  towards this poor, solitary alien, had a strong effect on the first  political feelings of the future Emperor of France. He particularly  resented their jokes about his foreign name _Napoleon_. Bourienne says  he often told him--\"Hereafter I will do the French what harm I can; as  for you, you never make me your jest--you love me.\"    From the beginning of the revolutionary struggle, boy and youth, he  espoused and kept by the side of those who desired the total change of  government. It is a strange enough fact, that Pichegru, afterwards so  eminent and ultimately so unfortunate, was for some time his monitor in  the school of Brienne. Being consulted many years later as to the chance  of enlisting Buonaparte in the cause of the exiled Bourbons, this man is  known to have answered: \"It will be lost time to attempt that--I knew  him in his youth--he has taken his side, and he will not change it.\"    In 1783 Buonaparte was, on the recommendation of his masters, sent from  Brienne to the Royal Military School at Paris; this being an  extraordinary compliment to the genius and proficiency of a boy of  fifteen.[5] Here he spent nearly two years, devoted to his studies. That  he laboured hard, both at Brienne and at Paris, we may judge; for his  after-life left scanty room for book-work, and of the vast quantity of  information which his strong memory ever placed at his disposal, the far  greater proportion must have been accumulated now. He made himself a  first-rate mathematician; he devoured history--his chosen authors being  Plutarch and Tacitus; the former the most simple painter that antiquity  has left us of heroic characters--the latter the profoundest master of  political wisdom. The poems of Ossian were then new to Europe, and  generally received as authentic remains of another age and style of  heroism. The dark and lofty genius which they display, their indistinct  but solemn pictures of heroic passions, love, battle, victory, and  death, were appropriate food for Napoleon's young imagination; and, his  taste being little scrupulous as to minor particulars, Ossian continued  to be through life his favourite poet. While at Paris, he attracted much  notice among those who had access to compare him with his fellows; his  acquirements, among other advantages, introduced him to the familiar  society of the celebrated Abbe Raynal. Napoleon, shortly after entering  the school at Paris, drew up a memorial, which he in person presented to  the superintendents of the establishment. He complained that the mode of  life was too expensive and delicate for \"poor gentlemen,\" and could not  prepare them either for returning to their \"modest homes,\" or for the  hardships of the camp. He proposed that, instead of a regular dinner of  two courses daily, the students should have ammunition bread, and  soldiers' rations, and that they should be compelled to mend and clean  their own stockings and shoes. This memorial is said to have done him no  service at the military school.    He had just completed his sixteenth year when (in August, 1785,) after  being examined by the great Laplace, he obtained his first commission as  second lieutenant in the artillery regiment _La Fere_. His corps was at  Valance when he joined it; and he mingled, more largely than might have  been expected from his previous habits, in the cultivated society of the  place. His personal advantages were considerable; the outline of the  countenance classically beautiful; the eye deep-set and dazzlingly  brilliant; the figure short, but slim, active, and perfectly knit.  Courtly grace and refinement of manners he never attained, nor perhaps  coveted; but he early learned the art, not difficult probably to any  person possessed of such genius and such accomplishments, of rendering  himself eminently agreeable wherever it suited his purpose or  inclination to be so.    On the 27th February in this year his father died of a cancer in the  stomach, aged forty-five; the same disease which was destined, at a  somewhat later period of life, to prove fatal to himself.    While at Valance Buonaparte competed anonymously for a prize offered by  the Academy of Lyons for the best answer to Raynal's Question: \"What are  the principles and institutions by the application of which mankind can  be raised to the highest happiness?\" He gained the prize: what were the  contents of his Essay we know not. Talleyrand, long afterwards, obtained  the manuscript, and, thinking to please his sovereign, brought it to  him. He threw his eye over two or three pages, and tossed it into the  fire. The treatise of the Lieutenant probably abounded in opinions which  the Emperor had found it convenient to forget.    Even at Brienne his political feelings had been determined. At Valance  he found the officers of his regiment divided, as all the world then  was, into two parties; the lovers of the French Monarchy, and those who  desired its overthrow. He sided openly with the latter. \"Had I been a  general,\" said Napoleon in the evening of his life, \"I might have  adhered to the king: being a subaltern, I joined the patriots.\"    In the beginning of 1792 he became captain of artillery (_unattached;_)  and, happening to be in Paris, witnessed the lamentable scenes of the  20th of June, when the revolutionary mob stormed the Tuileries, and the  king and his family, after undergoing innumerable insults and  degradations, with the utmost difficulty preserved their lives. He  followed the crowd into the garden before the palace; and when Louis  XVI. appeared on a balcony with the red cap on his head, could no longer  suppress his contempt and indignation. \"Poor driveller!\" said Napoleon,  loud enough to be heard by those near him, \"how could he suffer this  rabble to enter? If he had swept away five or six hundred with his  cannon, the rest would be running yet.\" He was also a witness of the  still more terrible 10th of August, when, the palace being once more  invested, the National Guard assigned for its defence took part with the  assailants; the royal family were obliged to take refuge in the National  Assembly, and the brave Swiss Guards were massacred almost to a man in  the courts of the Tuileries. Buonaparte was a firm friend to the  Assembly, to the charge of a party of which, at"]]]
