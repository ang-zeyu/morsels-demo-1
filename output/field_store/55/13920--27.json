And he knew that that sprawling, devastated metropolis  was not taboo to the merman. But this other mysterious settlement he  had recently heard of was still shunned by the sea people. Only  Sssuri and a few others of youthful years would consider a journey to  explore the long-forbidden section their traditions labeled as  dangerous land.    The belief that he was about to venture into questionable territory  had made Dalgard evasive when he reported his plans to the Elders  three days earlier. But since such trips were, by tradition, always  thrusts into the unknown, they had not questioned him too much. All in  all, Dalgard thought, watching Sssuri flake the firm pink flesh from  the fish, he might deem himself lucky and this quest ordained. He went  off to hack out armloads of grass and fashion the sleep mats for the  sun-warmed ground.    They had eaten and were lounging in content on the soft sand just  beyond the curl of the waves when Sssuri lifted his head from his  folded arms as if he listened. Like all those of his species, his  vestigial ears were hidden deep in his fur and no longer served any  real purpose; the mind touch served him in their stead. Dalgard caught  his thought, though what had aroused his companion was too rare a  thread to trouble his less acute senses.    \"Runners in the dark--\"    Dalgard frowned. \"It is still sun time. What disturbs them?\"    To the eye Sssuri was still listening to that which his friend could  not hear.    \"They come from afar. They are on the move to find new hunting  grounds.\"    Dalgard sat up. To each and every scout from Homeport the unusual was  a warning, a signal to alert mind and body. The runners in the  night--that furred monkey race of hunters who combed the moonless dark  of Astra when most of the higher fauna were asleep--were very  distantly related to Sssuri's species, though the gap between them was  that between highly civilized man and the jungle ape. The runners were  harmless and shy, but they were noted also for clinging stubbornly to  one particular district generation after generation. To find such a  clan on the move into new territory was to be fronted with a puzzle it  might be well to investigate.    \"A snake-devil--\" he suggested tentatively, forming a mind picture of  the vicious reptilian danger which the colonists tried to kill on  sight whenever and wherever encountered. His hand went to the knife at  his belt. One met with weapons only that hissing hatred motivated by a  brainless ferocity which did not know fear.    But Sssuri did not accept that explanation. He was sitting up, facing  inland where the thread of valley met the cliff wall. And seeing his  absorption, Dalgard asked no distracting questions.    \"No, no snake-devil--\" after long moments came the answer. He got to  his feet, shuffling through the sand in the curious little half dance  which betrayed his agitation more strongly than his thoughts had done.    \"The hoppers have no news,\" Dalgard said.    Sssuri gestured impatiently with one outflung hand. \"Do the hoppers  wander far from their own nest mounds? Somewhere there--\" he pointed  to the left and north, \"there is trouble, bad trouble. Tonight we  shall speak with the runners and discover what it may be.\"    Dalgard glanced about the camp with regret. But he made no protest as  he reached for his bow and stripped off its protective casing. With  the quiver of heavy-duty arrows slung across his shoulder he was ready  to go, following Sssuri inland.    The easy valley path ended less than a quarter of a mile from the sea,  and they were fronted by a wall of rock with no other option than to  climb. But the westering sun made plain every possible hand and foot  hold on its surface.    When they stood at last on the heights and looked ahead, it was across  a broken stretch of bare rock with the green of vegetation beckoning  from at least a mile beyond. Sssuri hesitated for only a moment or  two, his round, almost featureless head turning slowly, until he  fixed on a northeasterly course--striking out unerringly as if he  could already sight the goal. Dalgard fell in behind, looking over the  country with a wary eye. This was just the type of land to harbor  flying dragons. And while those pests were small, their  lightning-swift attack from above made them foes not to be  disregarded. But all the flying things he saw were two moth birds of  delicate hues engaging far over the sun-baked rock in one of their  graceful winged dances.    They crossed the heights and came to the inland slope, a drop toward  the central interior plains of the continent. As they plowed through  the high grasses Dalgard knew they were under observation. Hoppers  watched them. And once through a break in a line of trees he saw a  small herd of duocorns race into the shelter of a wood. The presence  of those two-horned creatures, so like the pictures he had seen of  Terran horses, was insurance that the snake-devils did not hunt in  this district, for the swift-footed duocorns were never found within a  day's journey of their archenemies.    Late afternoon faded into the long summer twilight and still Sssuri  kept on. As yet they had come across no traces of Those Others. Here  were none of the domed farm buildings, the monorail tracks, the other  relics one could find about Homeport. This wide-open land could have  been always a wilderness, left to the animals of Astra for their own.  Dalgard speculated upon that, his busy imagination supplying various  reasons for such tract. Then the voiceless communication of his  companion provided an explanation.    \"This was barrier land.\"    \"What?\"    Sssuri turned his head. His round eyes which blinked so seldom stared  into Dalgard's as if by the intensity of that gaze he could drive home  deeper his point.    \"What lies to the north was protected in the days before the falling  fire. Even _Those_\"--the distorted mermen symbol for Those Others was  sharpened by the very hatred of all Sssuri's kind, which had not paled  during the generations since their escape from slavery to Astra's  one-time masters--\"could not venture into some of their own private  places without special leave. It is perhaps true that the city we are  seeking is one of those restricted ones and that this wilderness is a  boundary for it.\"    Dalgard's pace slowed. To venture into a section of land which had  been used as a barrier to protect some secret of Those Others was a  highly risky affair. The first expedition sent out from Homeport after  the landing of the Terran refugee ship had been shot down by  robot-controlled guns still set against some long-dead invader. Would  this territory be so guarded? If so they had better go carefully now--    Sssuri suddenly struck off at an angle, heading not northeast now, but  directly north. The brush lands along the foot of the cliffs gave way  to open fields, bare except for the grass rippled by the wind. It was  not the type of country to attract the night runners, and Dalgard  wondered a little. They should discover water, preferably a shallow  stream, if they wanted to find what the monkey creatures liked best.    Within a quarter-hour he knew that Sssuri was not going wrong. Cradled  in a sudden dip in the land was the stream Dalgard had been looking  for. A hopper lifted a dripping muzzle from the shore ripples and  stared at them. Dalgard contacted the animal. It was its usual curious  self, nothing had alarmed or excited its interest. And he did not try  to establish more than a casual contact as they made their way down  the bank to the edge of the stream, Sssuri splashing in ankle-deep for  the sheer pleasure of feeling liquid curl about his feet and legs once  more.    Water dwellers fled from their passing and insects buzzed and hovered.  Otherwise they moved through a deserted world. The stream bed widened  and small islands of gravel, swept together in untidy piles by the  spring floods, arose dry topped, some already showing the green of  venturesome plants.    \"Here--\" Sssuri stopped, thrusting the butt of his spear into the  shore of one such islet. He dropped cross-legged on his choice, there  to remain patiently until those he sought would come with the dark.  Dalgard withdrew a little way downstream and took up a similar post.  The runners were shy, not easy to approach. And they would come more  readily if Sssuri were alone.    Here the murmur of the stream was loud, rising above the rustle of the  wind-driven grass. And the night was coming fast as the sun, hidden by  the cliff wall, sank into the sea. Dalgard, knowing that his night  sight was far inferior to that of the native Astran fauna, resignedly  settled himself for an all-night stay, not without a second regretful  memory of the snug camp by the shore.    Twilight and then night. How long before the runners would make their  appearance? He could pick up the sparks of thought which marked the  coming and going of hoppers, most hurrying off to their mud-plastered  nests, and sometimes a flicker from the mind of some other night  creature. Once he was sure he touched the avid, raging hunger which  marked a flying dragon, though they were not naturally hunters by  darkness.    Dalgard made no move to contact Sssuri. The merman must be left  undisturbed in his mental quest for the runners.    The scout lay back on his miniature island and stared up into the sky,  trying to sort out all the myriad impressions of life about him. It  was then that he saw it....    An arrow of fire streaking across the black bowl of Astra's night sky.  A light so vivid, so alien, that it brought him to his feet with a  chill prickle of apprehension along his spine. In all his years as a  scout and woodsman, in all the stories of his fellows and his elders  at Homeport--he had never seen, never heard of the like of that!    And through his own wonder and alert alarm,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18464"],[0,"The Wit and Humor of America, Volume I. (of X.) (#2)"],[1,"of tender  verse, had a keen and nimble wit. An ambitious poet once sent him a poem  to read entitled \"Why do I live?\" and Field immediately wrote back:  \"Because you sent your poem by mail.\"    Laughter is one of the best medicines in the world, and though some  people would make you force it down with a spoon, there is no doubt that  it is a splendid tonic and awakens the appetite for happiness.    Colonel Ingersoll wrote on his photograph which adorns my home: \"To the  man who knows that mirth is medicine and laughter lengthens life.\"    Abraham Lincoln, that divinely tender man, believed that fun was an  intellectual impetus, for he read Artemus Ward to his Cabinet before  reading his famous emancipation proclamation, and laying down his book  marked the place to resume.    Joel Chandler Harris, whose delightful stories of negro life hold such a  high place in American literature, told me a story of an old negro who  claimed that a sense of humor was necessary to happiness in married  life. He said:    \"I met a poor old darkey one day, pushing a wheelbarrow loaded with  cooking utensils and household effects. Seeing me looking curiously at  him, he shook his head and said:    \"'I cain't stand her no longer, boss, I jes' nash'ully cain't stand her  no longer.'    \"'What's the matter, uncle?' I inquired.    \"'Well, you see, suh, she ain't got no idee o' fun--she won't take a  joke nohow. The other night I went home, an' I been takin' a little jes'  to waam ma heart--das all, jes to waam ma heart--an' I got to de fence,  an' tried to climb it. I got on de top, an' thar I stays; I couldn't git  one way or t'other. Then a gem'en comes along, an' I says, \"Would you  min' givin' me a push?\" He says, \"Which way you want to go?\" I says,  \"Either way--don't make no dif'unce, jes' so I git off de fence, for  hit's pow'ful oncom'fable up yer.\" So he give me a push, an' sont me  over to'ard ma side, an' I went home. Then I want sum'in t' eat, an' my  ol' 'ooman she wouldn' git it fo' me, an' so, jes' fo' a joke, das  all--jes' a joke, I hit 'er awn de haid. But would you believe it, she  couldn't take a joke. She tu'n aroun', an' sir, she sail inter me  sum'in' scan'lous! I didn' do nothin', 'cause I feelin' kind o'weak jes'  then--an' so I made up ma min' I wasn' goin' to stay with her. Dis  mawnin' she gone out washin', an' I jes' move right out. Hit's no use  tryin' to live with a 'ooman who cain't take a joke!'\"    From the poems of Thomas Bailey Aldrich to George Ade's Fables in Slang  is a far cry, but one is as typical a style of humor as the other.  Ade's is the more distinctly original, for he not only created the  style, but another language. The aptness of its turns, and the marvelous  way in which he hit the bull's-eye of human foibles and weaknesses  lifted him into instantaneous popularity. A famous _bon mot_ of George  Ade's which has been quoted threadbare, but which serves excellently to  illustrate his native wit, is his remark about a suit of clothes which  the tailor assured him he could _never_ wear out. He said when he put  them on he didn't _dare_ to.    From the laughter-makers pure and simple, we come to those who, while  acknowledging the cloud, yet see the silver lining--the exponents of the  smile through tears.    The best of these, Frank L. Stanton, has beautifully said:        \"This world that we're a-livin' in        Is mighty hard to beat;      With every rose you get a thorn,        But ain't the roses sweet?\"    He does not deny the thorns, but calls attention to the sweetness of the  roses--a gospel of compensation that speaks to the heart of all; kind  words of cheer to the weary traveler.    Such a philosopher was the kind-hearted and sympathetic Irish boy who,  walking along with the parish priest, met a weary organ-grinder, who  asked how far it was to the next town. The boy answered, \"Four miles.\"  The priest remonstrated:    \"Why, Mike, how can you deceive him so? You know it is eight.\"    \"Well, your riverence,\" said the good-natured fellow, \"I saw how tired  he was, and I wanted to kape his courage up. If I'd told him the truth,  he'd have been down-hearted intirely!\"    This is really a jolly old world, and people are very apt to find just  what they are looking for. If they are looking for happiness, the best  way to find it is to try to give it to others. If a man goes around with  a face as long as a wet day, perfectly certain that he is going to be  kicked, he is seldom disappointed.    A typical exponent of the tenderly human, the tearfully humorous, is  James Whitcomb Riley--a name to conjure with. Only mention it to anyone,  and note the spark of interest, the smiling sigh, the air of gentle  retrospection into which he will fall. There is a poem for each and  every one, that commends itself for some special reason, and holds such  power of memory or sentiment as sends it straight into the heart, to  remain there treasured and unforgotten.    In these volumes are selections from the pen of all whom I have  mentioned, as well as many more, including a number by the clever women  humorists, of whom America is justly proud.    It is with pride and pleasure that I acknowledge the honor done me in  being asked to introduce this company of fun-makers--such a goodly  number that space permits the mention of but a few. But we cannot have  too much or even enough of anything so good or so necessary as the  literature that makes us laugh. In that regard we are like a little  friend of Mr. Riley's.    The Hoosier poet, as everyone knows, is the devoted friend, companion,  and singer of children. He has a habit of taking them on wild orgies  where they are turned loose in a candy store and told to do their worst.  This particular young lady had been allowed to choose all the sorts of  candy she liked until her mouth, both arms, and her pockets were full.  Just as they got to the door to go out, she hung back, and when Mr.  Riley stooped over asking her what was the matter, she whispered:    \"Don't you think it smells like ice cream?\"    Poems, stories, humorous articles, fables, and fairy tales are offered  for your choice, with subjects as diverse as the styles; but however the  laugh is gained, in whatever fashion the jest is delivered, the  laugh-maker is a public benefactor, for laughter is the salt of life,  and keeps the whole dish sweet.
