In view of these variations in the pictures of the Dresden  Codex, it is very striking that in the Codex Tro.-Cortesianus, there is  only one invariable type of the death-god.        [10-1] See Plate for representations of the gods, A-P    A distinguishing ornament of the death-god consists of globular bells or  rattles, which he wears on his hands and feet, on his collar and as a  head ornament. As can be distinctly seen in Dr. 11a, they are fastened  with bands wound around the forearm and around the leg; in Dr. 15c these  bells are black.    Among the symbols of the death-god a cross of two bones should be  mentioned, which is also found in the Mexican manuscripts. This cross of  bones seems to occur once among the written characters as a hieroglyph  and then in combination with a number: Tro. 10.* The figure [Death-god  symbol] is also a frequent symbol of the death-god. Its significance is  still uncertain, but it also occurs among the hieroglyphs as a death-sign  and as a sign for the day Cimi (death).    The hieroglyphs of the death-god have been positively determined (see  Figs. 1 to 4). Figs. 1 and 2 are the forms of the Dresden manuscript and  Figs. 3 and 4 are those of the Madrid manuscript. God A is almost always  distinguished by two hieroglyphs, namely Figs. 1 and 2 or 3 and 4.  Moreover the hieroglyphs are always the same, have scarcely any variants.  Even in Dr. 9c, where the deity is represented as feminine, there are no  variations which might denote the change of sex. The hieroglyphs consist  chiefly of the head of a corpse with closed eyes, and of a skull. The  design in front of the skull in Figs. 2 and 4 and under it in Fig. 3 is a  sacrificial knife of flint, which was used in slaying the sacrifices, and  is also frequently pictured in the Aztec manuscripts. The dots under Fig.  1 are probably intended to represent blood.    The death-god is represented with extraordinary frequency in all the Maya  manuscripts. Not only does the figure of the god itself occur, but his  attributes are found in many places where his picture is missing. Death  evidently had an important significance in the mythologic conceptions of  the Mayas. It is connected with sacrifice, especially with human  sacrifices performed in connection with the captive enemy. Just as we find  a personification of death in the manuscripts of the Mayas, we also find  it in the picture-writings of the ancient Mexicans, often surprisingly  like the pictures of the Maya codices. The Aztec death-god and his myth  are known through the accounts of Spanish writers; regarding the death-god  of the Mayas we have less accurate information. Some mention occurs in  Landa's Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan, Sec. XXIII, but unfortunately  nothing is said of the manner of representing the death-god. He seems to  be related to the Aztec Mictlantecutli, of whom Sahagun, Appendix to Book  III, \"De los que iban al infierno y de sus obsequias,\" treats as the god  of the dead and of the underworld, Mictlan. When the representations of  the latter, for example in the Codex Borgia, and in the Codex Vaticanus  No. 3773, are compared with those of the Maya manuscripts, there can be  hardly a doubt of the correspondence of the two god figures. In the Codex  Borgia, p. 37, he is represented once with the same characteristic head  ornament, which the death-god usually wears in the Maya manuscripts, and  in the Codex Fejervary, p. 8, the death-god wears a kind of breeches on  which cross-bones are depicted, exactly as in Dr. 9 (bottom).    Bishop Landa informs us that the Mayas \"had great and immoderate dread of  death.\" This explains the frequency of the representations of the  death-god, from whom, as Landa states, \"all evil and especially death\"  emanated. Among the Aztecs we find a male and a female death-deity,  Mictlantecutli and Mictlancihuatl. They were the rulers of the realm of  the dead, Mictlan, which, according to the Aztec conception, lay in the  north; hence the death-god was at the same time the god of the north.    It agrees with the calendric and astronomic character of the Maya deities  in the manuscripts, that a number of the figures of the gods are used in  connection with specified cardinal points. Since, according to the Aztec  conception, the death-god was the god of the north, we might expect that  in the Maya manuscripts also, the death-god would be always considered  as the deity of the north. Nevertheless this happens only _once_, namely  in the picture at the end of Codex Cort., pp. 41 and 42. Elsewhere, on  the other hand, this god is connected with other cardinal points, thus  Dr. 14a with the west or east (the hieroglyph is illegible, but it can  be only west or east), and in Dr. 27c with the west. It is interesting  to note that once, however, in a series of cardinal points, the  hieroglyph of the death-god connected with the numeral 10 stands just in  the place of the sign of the north; this is on Tro. 24* (bottom).    In regard to the name of the death-god in the Maya language, Landa tells  us that the wicked after death were banished to an underworld, the name  of which was \"Mitnal\", a word which is defined as \"Hell\" in the Maya  lexicon of Pio Perez and which has a striking resemblance to Mictlan, the  Aztec name for the lower regions. The death-god Hunhau reigned in this  underworld. According to other accounts (Hernandez), however, the  death-god is called Ahpuch. These names can in no wise serve as aids to  the explanation of the hieroglyphs of the death-god, since they have no  etymologic connection with death or the heads of corpses and skulls,  which form the main parts of the hieroglyph. Furthermore, the hieroglyphs  of the gods certainly have a purely ideographic significance as already  mentioned above, so that any relation between the names of the deities  and their hieroglyphs cannot exist from the very nature of the case.    The day of the death-god is the day Cimi, death. The day-sign Cimi  corresponds almost perfectly with the heads of corpses contained in the  hieroglyphs of the death-god.    A hieroglyphic sign, which relates to death and the death-deity and  occurs very frequently, is the sign Fig. 5, which is probably to be  regarded as the ideogram of the owl. It represents the head of an owl,  while the figure in front of it signifies the owl's ear and the one  below, its teeth, as distinguishing marks of a bird of prey furnished  with ears and a powerful beak. The head of the owl appears on a human  body several times in the Dresden manuscript as a substitute for the  death-deity, thus Dr. 18c, 19c, 20a and 20c and in other places, and  the hieroglyphic group (Fig. 5) is almost a regular attendant hieroglyph  of the death-god.    A series of other figures of the Maya mythology is connected with the  death-god. This is evident from the fact that his hieroglyphs or his  symbols occur with certain other figures, which are thus brought into  connection with death and the death-deity.    These figures are as follows:    1. His companion, god F, the god of war, of human sacrifice and of  violent death in battle, apparently a counterpart of the Aztec Xipe, who  will be discussed farther on.    2. The moan bird. See beyond under Mythological Animals, No. 1.    3. The dog. See the same, No. 3.    4. A human figure, possibly representing the priest of the death-god (see  Dr. 28, centre, Dr. 5b and 9a). The last figure is a little doubtful.  It is blindfolded and thus recalls the Aztec deity of frost and sin,  Itztlacoliuhqui. A similar form with eyes bound occurs only once again in  the Maya manuscripts, namely Dr. 50 (centre). That this figure is related  to the death-god is proved by the fact that on Dr. 9a it wears the  Cimi-sign on the middle piece of the chain around its neck. Furthermore  it should be emphasized that the Aztec sin-god, Itztlacoliuhqui, likewise  appears with symbols of death.    5. An isolated figure, Dr. 50a (the sitting figure at the right). This  wears the skull as head ornament, which is represented in exactly the  same way as in the Aztec manuscripts (see Fig. 6).    6. Another isolated figure is twice represented combined with the  death-god in Dr. 22c. This picture is so effaced that it is impossible  to tell what it means. The hieroglyph represents a variant of the  death's-head, Cimi. It seems to signify an ape, which also in the  pictures of the Mexican codices was sometimes used in relation to the  death-god.    The symbols of the death-god are also found with the figure without a  head on Dr. 2 (45)a, clearly the picture of a beheaded prisoner. Death  symbols occur, too, with the curious picture of a hanged woman on Dr.  53b, a picture which is interesting from the fact that it recalls  vividly a communication of Bishop Landa. Landa tells us, the Mayas  believed that whoever hanged himself did not go to the underworld, but to  \"paradise,\" and as a result of this belief, suicide by hanging was very  common and was chosen on the slightest pretext. Such suicides were  received in paradise by the goddess of the hanged, Ixtab. Ix is the  feminine prefix; tab, taab, tabil mean, according to Perez' Lexicon of  the Maya Language, \"cuerda destinada para algun uso exclusivo\". The name  of this strange goddess is, therefore, the \"Goddess of the Halter\" or, as  Landa says, \"The Goddess of the Gallows\". Now compare Dr. 53. On the  upper half of the page is the death-god represented with hand raised  threateningly, on the lower half is seen the form of a woman suspended by  a rope placed around her neck. The closed eye, the open mouth and the  convulsively outspread fingers, show that she is dead, in fact,  strangled. It is, in all probability, the goddess of the gallows and  halter, Ixtab, the patroness of the hanged, who is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18019"],[0,"The Luckiest Girl in the School (#2)"],[1," Longworth College and send him daily to be coached by          your parish curate. From my knowledge of his character I          consider the discipline of a public school to be indispensable          if he is to grow into worthy manhood, and sooner than allow the          wholesome restraint of his house master to be removed at this          critical portion of his life, I will myself defray half the cost          of his maintenance for the next two years.            \"Now as regards Winona. I believe she has ability, and it is          high time to begin to think seriously what you mean to do with          her. In the future women will have to depend upon themselves,          and I consider that all girls should be trained to gain their          own living. The foundation of every career is a good          education--without this it is impossible to build at all, and          Winona certainly cannot obtain it if she remains at home. The          new High School at Seaton is offering two open Scholarships to          girls resident in the County, the examination for which is on          September 8th. I propose that Winona enters for this          examination, and that if she should be a successful candidate,          she should come to live with me during the period of her          attendance at the High School. The education is the best          possible, there is a prospect of a University Scholarship to be          competed for, and every help and encouragement is given to the          girls in their choice of a career. With Winona off your hands, I          should suggest that you should engage a competent nursery          governess to teach the younger children the elements of order          and discipline. I would gladly pay her salary on the          understanding that I should myself select her.            \"Trusting that these proposals may be of some service, and          hoping to hear a better account of your health,                                                    \"I remain,                                            \"Your affectionate Aunt                                                      \"and Godmother,                                                            \"Harriet Beach.\"        Winona laid down the letter with an agitated gasp. The proposition  almost took her breath away.    \"What an idea!\" she exclaimed indignantly. \"Mother, of course you won't  even dream of it for an instant! I'd _hate_ to go and live with Aunt  Harriet. It's not to be thought of!\"    \"Well, I don't know, Winona!\" wavered Mrs. Woodward. \"We must look at it  from all sides, and perhaps Aunt Harriet's right, and it really would be  for the best. Miss Harmon's a poor teacher, and I'm sure your music, at  any rate, is not a credit to her. You played that last piece shockingly  out of time. You know you said yourself that you were getting beyond  Miss Harmon!\"    Whatever impeachments Winona may have brought against her teacher, she  was certainly not prepared to admit them now. She rejected the project  of the Seaton High School with the utmost energy and determination,  bringing into the fray all that force of character which her mother  lacked. Poor Mrs. Woodward vacillated feebly--she was generally swayed  by whoever was nearest at the moment--and I verily believe Winona's  arguments would have prevailed, and the whole scheme would have been  abandoned, had not Mr. Joynson opportunely happened to turn up.    Mr. Joynson was a solicitor, and the trustee of Mrs. Woodward's  property. He managed most of her business affairs, and some of her  private ones as well. She had confidence in his judgment, and she at  once thankfully submitted the question of Winona's future to his  decision.    \"The very thing for her!\" he declared. \"Do her a world of good to go to  a proper school. She's frittering her time away here. Send her to Seaton  by all means. What are you to do without her? Nonsense! Nobody's  indispensable--especially a girl of fifteen! Pack her off as soon as you  can. Doesn't want to go? Oh, she'll sing a different song when once she  gets there, you'll see!\"    Thus supported by masculine authority, Mrs. Woodward settled the  question in the affirmative, and replied to her aunt by return of post.    Naturally such a stupendous event as the exodus of Winona made a  sensation in the household.    \"Well, of all the rum shows!\" exclaimed Percy. \"You and Aunt Harriet in  double harness! It beats me altogether!\"    \"It's atrocious!\" groaned Winona. \"I'm a victim sacrificed for the good  of the family. Oh! why couldn't mother have thought of some other way of  economizing? I don't want to win scholarships and go in for a career!\"    \"Buck up! Perhaps you won't win! There'll be others in for the exam.,  you bet! You'll probably fail, and come whining home like a whipped  puppy with its tail between its legs!\"    \"Indeed I shan't!\" flared Winona indignantly. \"I've a little more spirit  than that, thank you! And why should you imagine I'm going to fail? I  suppose I've as much brains as most people!\"    \"That's right! Upset the pepper-pot! I was only trying to comfort you!\"  teased Percy. \"In my opinion you'll be returned like a bad halfpenny,  or one of those articles 'of no use to anybody except the owner.' Aunt  Harriet will be cheated of her prey after all!\"    \"If Win goes away, I shall be the eldest daughter at home,\" said Letty  airily, shaking out her short skirts. \"I'll sit at the end of the table,  and pour out tea if mother has a headache, and unlock the apple room,  and use the best inkpot if I like, and have first innings at the piano.\"    \"You forget about the nursery governess,\" retorted Winona. \"If I go, she  comes, and you'll find you've exchanged King Log for King Stork. Oh,  very well, just wait and see! It won't be as idyllic as you imagine. I  shall be saved the trouble of looking after you, at any rate.\"    \"What I'm trying to ascertain, madam,\" said Percy blandly, \"is whether  your ladyship wishes to take up your residence in Seaton or not. With  the usual perversity of your sex you pursue a pig policy. When I venture  to picture you seated at the board of your venerable aunt, you protest  you are a sacrifice; when, on the other hand, I suggest your return to  the bosom of your family, you revile me equally.\"    \"You're the most unsympathetic _beast_ I've ever met!\" declared Winona  aggrievedly.    When she analyzed her feelings, however, she was obliged to allow that  they were mixed. Though the prospect of settling down at Seaton filled  her with dismay, Percy's gibe at her probable failure touched her pride.  Winona had always been counted as the clever member of the family. It  would be too ignominious to be sent home labeled unfit. She set her  teeth and clenched her fists at the bare notion.    \"I'll show them all what I can do if I take a thing up!\" she resolved.    In the meantime Mrs. Woodward was immersed in the subject of clothing.  Every post brought her boxes of patterns, amongst which she hesitated,  lost in choice.    \"If I knew whether you're really going to stay at Seaton or not, it  would make all the difference, Winona,\" she fluttered. \"It's no use  buying you these new things if you're only to wear them at home, but I'd  make an effort to send you nice to Aunt Harriet's. I know she'll  criticize everything you have on. Dear me, I think I'd better risk it!  It would be such a nuisance to have to write for the patterns all over  again, and how could I get your dresses fitted when you weren't here to  be tried on? Miss Jones is at liberty now, and can come for a week's  sewing, but she'll probably be busy if I want her later. Now tell me,  which do you really think is the prettier of these two shades? I like  the fawn, but I believe the material will spot. What have you done with  the lace collar Aunt Harriet gave you last Christmas? She's sure to ask  about it if you don't wear it!\"    Having decided that on the whole she intended to win a scholarship,  Winona bluffed off the matter of her departure.    \"I've changed my mind, that's all,\" she announced to her home circle.  \"It will be a great comfort to me not to hear Mamie scraping away at her  violin in the evenings, or Letty strumming at scales. Think what a  relief not to be obliged to rout up Dorrie and Godfrey, and haul them  off to school every day! I'm tired of setting an example. You needn't  snigger!\"    The family grinned appreciatively. They understood Winona.    \"Don't you worry! I'll set the example when you're gone,\" Letty assured  her. \"I'll be as improving as a copy-book. I wish I'd your chance; I'd  stand Aunt Harriet for the sake of going to a big High School. Younger  sisters never have any luck! Eldests just sweep the board. I don't know  where we come in!\"    \"Don't you fret, young 'un, you'll score later on!\" cooed an indulgent  voice from the sofa, where Percy sprawled with a book and a bag of  walnuts. \"Remember that when you're still in all the bliss and sparkle  of your teens, Winona'll be a mature and _passee_ person of twenty-two.  'That eldest Miss Woodward's getting on, you know!' people will say, and  somebody'll reply: 'Yes, poor thing!'\"    \"They won't when I've got a career,\" retorted Winona, pelting Percy with  his own walnut-shells.    \"You assured us the other day that you despised such vanities.\"    \"Well, it depends. Perhaps I'll be a lady tram conductor, and punch  tickets, or a post-woman, or drive a Government van!\"    \"If those are careers for girls, bag me for a steeple jack,\" chirped  Dorrie.    It was perhaps a good thing for Winona that such a short interval  elapsed between the acceptance of Aunt Harriet's proposal and the date  of the scholarship examination. The ten days were very busy ones, for  there seemed much to be done in the way of preparation. Miss Jones, the  dressmaker, was installed in the nursery with the sewing-machine, and  demanded frequent tryings-on, a process "]]]
