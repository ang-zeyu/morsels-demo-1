Wright and the cowboys disappeared ahead of us in the cottonwood trees.  Colonel Sampson got out of the buckboard and waited for us. His face  wore the best expression I had seen upon it yet. There was warmth and  love, and something that approached sorrow or regret.    His daughter was agitated, too. I got out and offered my seat, which  Colonel Sampson took.    It was scarcely a time for me to be required, or even noticed at all,  and I took advantage of it and turned toward the town.    Ten minutes of leisurely walking brought me to the shady outskirts of  Linrock and I entered the town with mingled feelings of curiosity,  eagerness, and expectation.    The street I walked down was not a main one. There were small, red  houses among oaks and cottonwoods.    I went clear through to the other side, probably more than half a mile.  I crossed a number of intersecting streets, met children, nice-looking  women, and more than one dusty-booted man.    Half-way back this street I turned at right angles and walked up several  blocks till I came to a tree-bordered plaza. On the far side opened a  broad street which for all its horses and people had a sleepy look.    I walked on, alert, trying to take in everything, wondering if I would  meet Steele, wondering how I would know him if we did meet. But I  believed I could have picked that Ranger out of a thousand strangers,  though I had never seen him.    Presently the residences gave place to buildings fronting right upon the  stone sidewalk. I passed a grain store, a hardware store, a grocery  store, then several unoccupied buildings and a vacant corner.    The next block, aside from the rough fronts of the crude structures,  would have done credit to a small town even in eastern Texas. Here was  evidence of business consistent with any prosperous community of two  thousand inhabitants.    The next block, on both sides of the street, was a solid row of saloons,  resorts, hotels. Saddled horses stood hitched all along the sidewalk in  two long lines, with a buckboard and team here and there breaking the  continuity. This block was busy and noisy.    From all outside appearances, Linrock was no different from other  frontier towns, and my expectations were scarcely realized.    As the afternoon was waning I retraced my steps and returned to the  ranch. The driver boy, whom I had heard called Dick, was looking for  me, evidently at Miss Sampson's order, and he led me up to the house.    It was even bigger than I had conceived from a distance, and so old that  the adobe bricks were worn smooth by rain and wind. I had a glimpse in  at several doors as we passed by.    There was comfort here that spoke eloquently of many a freighter's trip  from Del Rio. For the sake of the young ladies, I was glad to see things  little short of luxurious for that part of the country.    At the far end of the house Dick conducted me to a little room, very  satisfactory indeed to me. I asked about bunk-houses for the cowboys,  and he said they were full to overflowing.    \"Colonel Sampson has a big outfit, eh?\"    \"Reckon he has,\" replied Dick. \"Don' know how many cowboys. They're  always comin' an' goin'. I ain't acquainted with half of them.\"    \"Much movement of stock these days?\"    \"Stock's always movin',\" he replied with a queer look.    \"Rustlers?\"    But he did not follow up that look with the affirmative I expected.    \"Lively place, I hear--Linrock is?\"    \"Ain't so lively as Sanderson, but it's bigger.\"    \"Yes, I heard it was. Fellow down there was talking about two cowboys  who were arrested.\"    \"Sure. I heerd all about thet. Joe Bean an' Brick Higgins--they belong  heah, but they ain't heah much.\"    I did not want Dick to think me overinquisitive, so I turned the talk  into other channels. It appeared that Miss Sampson had not left any  instructions for me, so I was glad to go with Dick to supper, which we  had in the kitchen.    Dick informed me that the cowboys prepared their own meals down at the  bunks; and as I had been given a room at the ranch-house he supposed I  would get my meals there, too.    After supper I walked all over the grounds, had a look at the horses in  the corrals, and came to the conclusion that it would be strange if Miss  Sampson did not love her new home, and if her cousin did not enjoy her  sojourn there. From a distance I saw the girls approaching with Wright,  and not wishing to meet them I sheered off.    When the sun had set I went down to the town with the intention of  finding Steele.    This task, considering I dared not make inquiries and must approach him  secretly, might turn out to be anything but easy.    While it was still light, I strolled up and down the main street. When  darkness set in I went into a hotel, bought cigars, sat around and  watched, without any clue.    Then I went into the next place. This was of a rough crude exterior, but  the inside was comparatively pretentious, and ablaze with lights.    It was full of men, coming and going--a dusty-booted crowd that smelled  of horses and smoke.    I sat down for a while, with wide eyes and open ears. Then I hunted up a  saloon, where most of the guests had been or were going. I found a great  square room lighted by six huge lamps, a bar at one side, and all the  floor space taken up by tables and chairs.    This must have been the gambling resort mentioned in the Ranger's letter  to Captain Neal and the one rumored to be owned by the mayor of Linrock.  This was the only gambling place of any size in southern Texas in which  I had noted the absence of Mexicans. There was some card playing going  on at this moment.    I stayed in there for a while, and knew that strangers were too common  in Linrock to be conspicuous. But I saw no man whom I could have taken  for Steele.    Then I went out.    It had often been a boast of mine that I could not spend an hour in  a strange town, or walk a block along a dark street, without having  something happen out of the ordinary.    Mine was an experiencing nature. Some people called this luck. But it  was my private opinion that things gravitated my way because I looked  and listened for them.    However, upon the occasion of my first day and evening in Linrock it  appeared, despite my vigilance and inquisitiveness, that here was to be  an exception.    This thought came to me just before I reached the last lighted place in  the block, a little dingy restaurant, out of which at the moment, a  tall, dark form passed. It disappeared in the gloom. I saw a man sitting  on the low steps, and another standing in the door.    \"That was the fellow the whole town's talkin' about--the Ranger,\" said  one man.    Like a shot I halted in the shadow, where I had not been seen.    \"Sho! Ain't boardin' heah, is he?\" said the other.    \"Yes.\"    \"Reckon he'll hurt your business, Jim.\"    The fellow called Jim emitted a mirthless laugh. \"Wal, he's been _all_  my business these days. An' he's offered to rent that old 'dobe of mine  just out of town. You know, where I lived before movin' in heah. He's  goin' to look at it to-morrow.\"    \"Lord! does he expect to _stay_?\"    \"Say so. An' if he ain't a stayer I never seen none. Nice, quiet, easy  chap, but he just looks deep.\"    \"Aw, Jim, he can't hang out heah. He's after some feller, that's all.\"    \"I don't know his game. But he says he was heah for a while. An' he  impressed me some. Just now he says: 'Where does Sampson live?' I asked  him if he was goin' to make a call on our mayor, an' he says yes. Then I  told him how to go out to the ranch. He went out, headed that way.\"    \"The hell he did!\"    I gathered from this fellow's exclamation that he was divided between  amaze and mirth. Then he got up from the steps and went into the  restaurant and was followed by the man called Jim. Before the door  was closed he made another remark, but it was unintelligible to me.    As I passed on I decided I would scrape acquaintance with this  restaurant keeper.    The thing of most moment was that I had gotten track of Steele. I  hurried ahead. While I had been listening back there moments had elapsed  and evidently he had walked swiftly.    I came to the plaza, crossed it, and then did not know which direction  to take. Concluding that it did not matter I hurried on in an endeavor  to reach the ranch before Steele. Although I was not sure, I believed I  had succeeded.    The moon shone brightly. I heard a banjo in the distance and a cowboy  sing. There was not a person in sight in the wide courts or on the  porch. I did not have a well-defined idea about the inside of the house.    Peeping in at the first lighted window I saw a large room. Miss Sampson  and Sally were there alone. Evidently this was a parlor or a sitting  room, and it had clean white walls, a blanketed floor, an open fireplace  with a cheery blazing log, and a large table upon which were lamp,  books, papers. Backing away I saw that this corner room had a door  opening on the porch and two other windows.    I listened, hoping to hear Steele's footsteps coming up the road. But I  heard only Sally's laugh and her cousin's mellow voice.    Then I saw lighted windows down at the other end of the front part of  the house. I walked down. A door stood open and through it I saw a room  identical with that at the other corner; and here were Colonel Sampson,  Wright, and several other men, all smoking and talking.    It might have been interesting to tarry there within ear-shot, but I  wanted to get back to the road to intercept Steele. Scarcely had I  retraced my steps and seated myself on the porch steps when a very tall  dark figure loomed up in the moonlit road.    Steele! I wanted to yell like a boy. He came on slowly, looking all  around, halted some twenty paces distant, surveyed the house, then  evidently espying me, came on again.    My first feeling was, What a giant!

At the very foot of the Kutub Minar the  famous Iron Pillar commemorates the victories of the \"Sun of Power,\" the  Hindu Emperor of the Gupta dynasty with whose name, under the more  popular form of Raja Bikram, Indian legend associates the vague memories  of a golden age of Hindu civilisation in the fifth and sixth centuries.  The Pillar was brought there by one of the Rajput princes who founded in  the middle of the eleventh century the first city really known to  history as Delhi. There Prithvi Raja reigned, who still lives in Indian  minstrelsy as the embodiment of Hindu chivalry, equally gallant and  daring in love and in war--the last to make a stand in northern India  against the successive waves of Mahomedan conquest which Central Asia  had begun to pour in upon India in 1001, with the first of Mahmud  Ghazni's seventeen raids. In the next century an Afghan wave swept down  on the top of the original Turki wave, and Kutub-ed-Din, having  proclaimed himself Emperor of Delhi in 1206, built the great Mosque of  _Kuwwet-el-Islam_, \"The Power of Islam,\" and the lofty minaret, still  known by his name, from which for six centuries the Moslem call to  prayer went forth to proclaim Mahomedan domination over India.    With the monumental wreckage of those early Mahomedan dynasties, steeped  in treachery and bloodshed, the plain of Delhi is still strewn. The  annals of Indian history testify more scantily but not less eloquently  to their infamy until the supremacy of Delhi, but not of Islam, was  shaken for two centuries by Timur, who appeared out of the wild spaces  of Tartary and within a year disappeared into them again like a  devastating meteor. From his stock, nevertheless, was to proceed the  long line of Moghul Emperors who first under Baber and then under Akbar  won the Empire of Hindustan at the gates of Delhi, and for a time  succeeded in bringing almost the whole of India under their sway. But  their splendid marble halls in the great Fort of Delhi recall not only  the magnificence of the Moghul Empire, but its slow and sure decay,  until it became a suitor for the protection of the British power, which,  at first a mere trading power that had once sued humbly enough for its  protection, had risen to be the greatest military and political power  in India. It was at Delhi at the beginning of the nineteenth century  that Lord Lake rescued a Moghul Emperor from the hands of Mahratta  jailers, and it was at Delhi again that in 1857 the last semblance of  Moghul rulership disappeared out of history in the tempest of the  Mutiny. It was on the plain of Delhi that the assumption by Queen  Victoria of the imperial title was solemnly proclaimed in 1878, and,  with still greater pomp, King Edward's accession in 1903. There again in  1911 King George, the first of his line to visit his Indian Empire as  King-Emperor, received in person the fealty of princes and peoples and  restored Delhi to her former pride of place as its imperial capital.    Where else in the world can such a procession of the ages pass before  one's eyes, from the great \"Horse Sacrifice\" of the Pandavas at the dawn  of history to the inauguration by a British prince in the King-Emperor's  name of modern political institutions conceived in the democratic spirit  of British freedom?    Yet at the very time when an Indian-elected assembly, representing as  far as possible all creeds and classes and communities, and above all  the Western-educated classes who are the intellectual offspring of  British rule, were gathered together to hear delivered to them in  English--the one language in which, as a result of British rule, and by  no means the least valuable, Indians from all parts of a vast polyglot  country are able to hold converse--the Royal message throwing open to  the people of India the road to _Swaraj_ within the British Empire, the  imperial city of Delhi went into mourning as a sign of angry protest,  and the vast majority of its citizens, mostly, it must be remembered,  Mahomedans, very strictly observed a complete boycott of the Royal visit  in accordance with Mr. Gandhi's \"Non-co-operation\" campaign, and went  out in immense crowds to greet the strange Hindu saint and leader who  had come to preach to them his own very different message--a message of  revolt, not indeed by violence but by \"soul force,\" against the  soulless civilisation of the West.    In no other city in India would such an alliance between Hindus and  Mahomedans have seemed only a few years ago more unthinkable. For  nowhere else have we such a vision as in Delhi of the ruthlessness as  well as of the splendour of Mahomedan domination in India. Nowhere can  one measure as in Delhi the greatness of its fall, and its fall had  begun before it ever came into conflict with the rising British power.  It had been shaken to its foundations by the far more ancient power of  Hinduism, which Islam had subdued but never destroyed. In the  seventeenth century Shivaji, the hero still to-day of the Hindu revival  of which Mr. Gandhi is the latest apostle, led out for the first time  his Mahrattas in open rebellion against Delhi and started the continuous  process of disintegration from which the Moghul Emperors were driven to  purchase their only possible respite under British protection. Since  India finally passed not under Mahratta, but under British rule,  Hinduism has never again been subjected to the oppression which the  fierce monotheism of Islam itself taught all her Mahomedan rulers, with  the one noble exception of Akbar, to inflict upon an \"idolatrous\" race.  British rule introduced into India not only a new reign of law and order  but the principles of equal tolerance and justice for all which had  struck root in our own civilisation. Nevertheless, at the very moment at  which we were attempting to extend a wide and generous application of  those principles to the domain of political rights and liberties, we  were being confronted with unexpected forces of resistance which, even  in Mahomedan Delhi, drew their chief inspiration from Hinduism.    But, it might be argued, Delhi, though restored to the primacy it had  lost under British rule as the capital city of India, has continued to  live on the memories of the past and has been scarcely touched by the  breath of modern civilisation. For the full effect of close contact  with the West, ought one not to look to the great cities that have  grown up under British rule--to Calcutta, for instance, the seat until a  few years ago of British Government in India, itself a creation of the  British, and if not to-day a more prosperous centre of European  enterprise than Bombay, a larger and more populous city, in which the  Hindus are in an overwhelming majority? But in the life even of Calcutta  features are not lacking to remind one how persistent are the forces of  resistance to the whole spirit of the West which Mr. Gandhi mustered in  Delhi to protest against the purpose of the Duke of Connaught's mission.  Had not a great part of Calcutta itself also observed the _Hartal_  proclaimed by Mr. Gandhi during the Prince's visit?    On the surface it seems difficult in Calcutta to get even an occasional  glimpse of the old India upon which we have superimposed a new India  with results that are still in the making. In Bombay, though it proudly  calls itself \"the Western Gate of India\" the glow of Hindu funeral  pyres, divided only by a long wall from the fashionable drive which  sweeps along Back Bay from the city, still called the Fort, to Malabar  Hill, serves to remind one any evening that he is in an oriental world  still largely governed as ever by the doctrine of successive rebirths,  the dead being merely reborn to fresh life, in some new form according  to each one's merits or demerits, out of the flames that consume the  body. On Malabar Hill itself, in the very heart of the favourite  residential quarter whence the Europeans are being rapidly elbowed out  by Indian merchant princes, the finest site of all still encloses the  Towers of Silence on which, contrary to the Hindu usage of cremation,  the Parsees, holding fire too sacred to be subjected to contact with  mortal corruption, expose their dead to be devoured by vultures.  Calcutta has no such conspicuous landmarks of the East to disturb the  illusion produced by most of one's surroundings that this is a city  which, if not actually European, differs only from the European type in  the complexion and dress of its oriental population and the  architectural compromises imposed on European buildings by a tropical  climate. The Marquess of Wellesley built Government House over a hundred  years ago on the model of Kedleston, and it is still the stateliest  official residence in British India. Fort William with Olive's ramparts  and fosses is still almost untouched, and with an ever-expanding  Walhalla of bronze or marble Governors and Viceroys and  Commanders-in-Chief, and at the farther end the white marble walls and  domes of the Queen Victoria Memorial Hall--the one noble monument we  have built in India--at last nearing completion, the broad expanse of  Calcutta's incomparable Maidan is, even more than our London parks, the  green playfield and the vital lung of the whole city. Along and behind  Chowringhee there are still a few of the old-time mansions of  Thackeray's \"nabobs,\" with their deep, pillared verandahs standing well  off from the road, each within its discreet \"compound,\" but they are all  rapidly making room for \"eligible residences,\" more opulent perhaps but  more closely packed, or for huge blocks of residential flats, even less  adapted to the climate. The great business quarter round Dalhousie  Square has been steadily rebuilt on a scale of massive magnificence  scarcely surpassed in the city of London, and many of the shops compare  with those of"]]]
