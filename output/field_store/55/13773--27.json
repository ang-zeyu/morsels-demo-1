And what will you do?\"    \"Go back to Putnam Hall most likely--if the scarlet fever scare is  over.\"    \"Then we'll be likely to see you again before long,\" and Dora smiled  her pleasure.    \"It will be like old times to get back to the Hall again,\" Sam had put  in. \"But first, I want to go home and see the folks.\"    \"Right you are,\" had come from Tom. \"I reckon they are dead anxious to  see us, too.\"    And so they had parted, with tight hand-squeezing and bright smiles  that meant a good deal. One train had taken the girls southward to  Santa Barbara, and another had taken the boys eastward to Denver and to  Chicago. At the latter city the lads had made a quick change, and  twenty-six hours later found them at Oak Run, and in the carriage for  the farm.          CHAPTER II    NEWS OF INTEREST      \"My boys! my boys!\"    Such was the cry given by Anderson Rover, when he caught sight of the  occupants of the carriage, as the turnout swept up to the piazza of the  comfortable farm home.       \"Home again! Home again     Safe from a foreign shore!\"    sang out Tom, and leaping to the ground, he caught his father around the  shoulders. \"Aren't you glad to see us, father?\" he went on.    \"Glad doesn't express it, Tom,\" replied the fond parent, as he embraced  first one and then another. \"My heart is overflowing with joy, and I  thank God that you have returned unharmed, after having passed through  so many grave perils. How brown all of you look!\"    \"Tanned by the tropical sun,\" answered Sam. \"Oh, here is Aunt Martha,  and Uncle Randolph!\"    \"Sam!\" burst out the motherly aunt, as she kissed him. \"Oh, how you  must have suffered on that lonely island!\" And then she kissed the  others.    \"We've certainly had our fill of adventures,\" came from Dick, who was  shaking hands with his Uncle Randolph. \"And more than once we thought  we should never see Valley Brook farm again.\"    \"We were real Robinson Crusoes,\" went on Sam. \"And the girls were  Robinson Crusoes, too.\"    \"Are the girls well?\" questioned Mrs. Rover.    \"Very well, auntie. If they hadn't been we shouldn't have parted with  them in San Francisco. They went back to Santa Barbara to finish their  vacation.\"    \"I see. Well, it certainly was a wonderful trip. You'll have to tell us  all the particulars this evening. I suppose you are as hungry as bears  just now. Tom is, I'm sure.\"    \"Oh, Aunt Martha, I see you haven't forgotten my failing,\" piped in  the youth mentioned, with a twinkle in his eye. \"And do I get pie for  dinner?\"    \"Yes, Tom, and all you care to eat, too. We are going to make your  home-coming a holiday.\"    \"Good!\"    They were soon in the house, every nook and corner of which was so  familiar to them. They rushed up to their rooms, and, after a brushing  and a washing up, came down to the big dining room, where the table  fairly groaned with good things.    \"Gosh! this is a regular Christmas spread!\" observed Tom, as he looked  the table over. \"Tell you what, Aunt Martha, I'm going to be cast away  every week after this.\"    \"Oh, Tom, don't speak of it! After this you must stay right here.  Neither your father nor your uncle nor myself will want to leave you  out of sight.\"    \"Pooh! We can't stay home. But we'll be careful of our trips in the  future, you can be sure of that.\"    \"Have you heard anything about Putnam Hall since we went away?\" asked  Dick, during the meal.    \"The academy opened again last week, Dick,\" answered his father. \"We  received a circular letter from Captain Putnam. The scarlet fever scare  did not amount to much, for which the captain is very thankful.\"    \"I sent him a telegram, stating we were safe,\" said Sam. \"I knew he  would like to hear from us. The captain is a brick.\"    \"The best ever,\" said Tom, with his mouth full of chicken.    \"And ditto, Mr. Strong,\" put in Dick, referring to the head assistant  at the Hall.    \"Exactly, Dick. But no more Jasper Grinders in mine,\" went on Tom,  referring to a tyrannical teacher who had caused them much trouble, and  who had been discharged from the academy, as already mentioned in \"The  Rover Boys in the Mountains.\"    \"Or Josiah Crabtrees,\" said Dick, referring to another teacher, who had  been made to leave Putnam Hall, and who had wanted to marry the widow  Stanhope, in an endeavor to get control of the money that was coming to  Dora. Crabtree's misdeeds had landed him in prison, where he was likely  to stay for some time to come.    While the meal was still in progress the boys began the recital of  their many adventures, and this recital was kept up until a late hour.  It was astonishing how much they had to tell, and how interesting it  proved to the listeners.    \"You might make a book of it,\" said Anderson Rover. \"It equals our  adventures in the jungles of Africa.\"    \"I am going to write it out some day,\" answered Dick. \"And, maybe,  I'll get the story printed. The trouble is, I can't end the tale  properly.\"    \"How is that, Dick?\" asked his Uncle Randolph. \"You were all saved.  Isn't that a proper ending for any book?\"    \"Yes, but what of the villain? Baxter didn't show himself, and that is  no ending at all. He should have fallen over a cliff, or been shot, or  something like that.\"    \"And we should have married the three girls,\" put in fun-loving Tom.  \"That would make the story even more complete.\"    \"Well, things do not happen in real life as they do in story books,\"  said the parent. \"It is likely you will never hear of Dan Baxter  again. But we may hear from his father.\"    \"His father!\" exclaimed the three youths in concert.    \"Why, Arnold Baxter is in prison,\" added Sam.    \"He was, up to five days ago, when they took him to the hospital to  undergo some sort of an operation. At the hospital the operation was  postponed for a day, and during the night he slipped away from the  institution and disappeared.\"    \"Well, I never!\" burst out Dick. \"Isn't he the slick one, though!  Just when you think you've got him hard and fast, you haven't at all.\"    \"Haven't they any trace of him?\" asked Sam.    \"None, so far as I have heard. There was a report that he had gone to  New York and taken passage on a ship bound for Liverpool, but at  present the ship is on the Atlantic, so the authorities can do nothing.\"    \"I hope they catch him.\"    \"We all hope that, Sam.\"    For a few days the three boys did nothing but take it easy. It was  pleasant weather, and they roamed around the farm in company with their  father and their uncle, or with Alexander Pop, the colored man of work.  As my old readers know, Pop had been in former days a waiter at Putnam  Hall, and Dick, Tom, and Sam had befriended him on more than one  occasion, for which he was extremely grateful.    \"Yo' boys is jes' naturally fust-class heroes,\" said Aleck one day.  \"Even if dem cannonballs had cum after yo', I don't t'ink da could have  cotched yo', no, sirree!\"    \"It's a pity you weren't along, Aleck,\" answered Tom.    \"I can't say as to dat, Master Tom. I got 'bout all de hair-raisin'  times I wanted when we was in de jungles ob Africy. I'se only sorry ob  one t'ing.\"    \"And what is that?\"    \"Dat you didn't jes' go an' frow dat Dan Baxter overboard from dat ship  de fust time yo' sot eyes on him. Suah as yo' am born he'll turn up  some day to make moah trouble.\"    \"Well, if he turns up we'll be ready for him,\" returned Tom grimly.    \"How can yo' be ready fo' a pusson wot acts like a snake in de grass?  He'll sting befo' yo' hab de chance to spot him.\"    \"We'll have to keep our eyes open, Aleck,\" answered the youth; and then  the subject was changed.    During those days the boys went fishing and bathing in the river, and  also visited Humpback Falls, that spot where Sam had had such a  thrilling adventure, as related in \"The Rover Boys at School.\"    \"What a lot has happened since those days,\" said Sam, taking a deep  breath. \"Tom, do you remember how you got into trouble with old  Crabtree the very first day we landed at Putnam Hall?\"    \"I do, Sam; and do you remember our first meeting, on the boat, with  Dan Baxter, and how we sent him about his business when he tried to  annoy Nellie, and Grace, and Dora?\"    \"Yes, indeed. Say, I am getting anxious to get back to the Hall. It  seems almost like a second home.\"    \"So am I,\" put in Dick. \"Besides, we have lost time enough from our  studies. We'll have to pitch in, or we'll drop behind our classes.\"    \"Father says we can return to the Hall next Monday, if we wish.\"    \"I vote we do so.\"    \"So do I.\"    And thus it was decided that they should return to the academy four  days later.    But during those four days something was to happen which would have an  important bearing upon their future actions.          CHAPTER III    A MIDNIGHT VISITOR      The next day, shortly after noon, it began to rain, and the storm  increased in violence until the wind blew almost a gale.    The rain kept the boys indoors, at which Tom was inclined to grumble.    \"No use of grumbling, Tom,\" said Dick cheerfully. \"Let us improve the  time by looking over our school books. That will make it easier to slip  into the grind again when we get back to the Hall.\"    \"That is excellent advice, Richard,\" said Randolph Rover. \"Whatever you  do, do not neglect your studies.\"    \"By the way, Uncle Randolph, how is scientific farming progressing?\"  said Tom, referring to something that had been his uncle's hobby for  years--a hobby that had cost the gentleman considerable money.    \"Well--ah--to tell the truth, Thomas, not as well as I had hoped for.\"    \"Hope you didn't drop a thousand or two this year, uncle?\"    \"Oh, no--not over fifty dollars.\"    \"Then you got off easy.\"    \"I shall do better next year. The potatoes already show signs of  improvement.\"    \"Good! I suppose you'll be growing 'em on top of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15803"],[0,"Crime and Its Causes (#2)"],[1,"al, political, and economic changes constantly  taking place in all highly organised societies. It was also equally  impossible to appreciate the effect of punishment for good or evil on  the criminal population. Justice had little or no data to go upon;  prisoners were sentenced in batches to the gallows, to transportation,  to the hulks, or to the county gaol, but no inquiry was made as to the  result of these punishments on the criminal classes or on the progress  of crime. It was deemed sufficient to catch and punish the offender;  the more offences seemed to increase--there was no sure method of  knowing whether they did increase or not--the more severe the  punishment became. Justice worked in the dark, and was surrounded by  the terrors of darkness. What followed is easy to imagine; the  criminal law of England reached a pitch of unparalleled barbarity, and  within living memory laws were on the statute book by which a man  might be hanged for stealing property above the value of a shilling.    Had a fairly accurate system of criminal statistics existed, it is  very likely that the data contained in them would have reassured the  nation and tempered the severity of the law.    Of Criminal Statistics it may be said in the first place, that they  act as an annual register for tabulating the amount of danger to which  society is exposed by the nefarious operations of lawless persons. By  these statistics we are informed of the number of crimes committed  during the course of the year so far as they are reported to the  police. We are informed of the number of persons brought to trial for  the perpetration of these crimes; of the nature of the offences with  which incriminated persons are charged, and of the length of sentence  imposed on those who are sent to prison. The age, the degree of  instruction, and the occupations of prisoners are also tabulated. A  record is also kept of the number of times a man has been committed to  prison, and of the manner in which he has conducted himself while in  confinement.    One important point must be mentioned on which criminal statistics are  almost entirely silent. The great sources of crime are the personal,  the social, and the economic conditions of the individuals who commit  it. Criminal statistics, to be exhaustive, ought to include not only  the amount of crime and the degrees of punishment awarded to  offenders; these statistics should also, as far as practicable, take  cognisance of the sources from which crime undoubtedly springs. In  this respect, our information, so far as it comes to us through  ordinary channels, is lamentably deficient. It is confined to data  respecting the age, sex, and occupation of the offender. These data  are very interesting, and very useful, as affording a glimpse of the  sources from which the dark river of delinquency takes its rise. But  they are too meagre and fragmentary. They require to be completed by  the personal and social history of the criminal. Crime is not  necessarily a disease, but it resembles disease in this respect, that  it will be impossible to wipe it out till an accurate diagnosis has  been made of the causes which produce it. To punish crime is all very  well; but punishment is not an absolute remedy; its deterrent action  is limited, and other methods besides punishment must be adopted if  society wishes to gain the mastery over the criminal population. What  those methods should be can only be ascertained after the most  searching preliminary inquiries into the main factors of crime. It  ought, therefore, to be a weighty part of the business of criminal  statistics to offer as full information as possible, not only  respecting crimes and punishments, but much more respecting criminals.  Every criminal has a life history; that history is very frequently the  explanation of his sinister career; it ought, therefore, to be  tabulated, so that it may be seen how far his descent and his  surroundings have contributed to make him what he is. In the case of  children sent to Reformatory Schools, the previous history of the  child is always tabulated. Enquiries are made and registered  respecting the parents of the child; what country they belong to, what  sort of character they bear, whether they are honest and sober,  whether they have ever been in prison, what wages they earn, and  whether the child is legitimate or not. A similar method to the one  adopted with Reformatory children ought to be instituted, with  suitable modifications, in European prisons and convict  establishments. It is, at the present time, being advocated by almost  all the most eminent criminal authorities,[1] and more than one scheme  has been drawn up to show the scope of its operation.        [1] See Appendix I.    In addition to the service which a complete personal and family record  of convicted prisoners would render as to the causes of crime, such a  record would be of immense advantage to the judges. At the present  time a judge is only made acquainted with the previous convictions of  a prisoner; he knows nothing more about him except through the  evidence which is sometimes adduced as to character. An accurate  record of the prisoner's past would enable the judge to see at once  with what sort of offender he was dealing, and might, perhaps, help to  put a stop to the unequal and capricious sentences which, not  infrequently, disgrace the name of justice.[2]        [2] In his interesting work, \"Die Beziehungen zwischen      Geistesstoerung und Verbrechen,\" Dr. Sander shows that out of a      hundred insane persons brought up for trial, the judges only      discovered the mental state of from twenty-six to twenty-eight      per cent. of them.    Passing from this point, we shall now inquire into the possibility of  establishing some system of International Statistics, whereby the  volume of crime in one country may be compared with the volume of  crime in another. At the present time it is extremely difficult to  institute any such comparison, and it is questionable if it can ever  be properly done. In no two countries is the criminal law the same,  and an act which is perfectly harmless when committed in one part of  Europe, is considered in another as a contravention of the law. Each  country has also a nomenclature of crime and methods of criminal  procedure peculiar to itself. In each country the police are organised  on a different principle, and act in the execution of their duty on a  different code of rules. In all cases, for instance, of mendicancy,  drunkenness, brawling, and disorder, the initiative rests practically  with the police, and it depends almost entirely on the instructions  issued to the police whether such offences shall figure largely or not  in the statistics of crime. A proof of this fact may be seen in the  Report of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, for the year  1888. In the year 1886, the number of persons convicted in the  Metropolis of \"Annoying male persons for the purpose of prostitution\"  was 3,233; in 1888, the number was only 1,475. This enormous decrease  in the course of two years is not due to a diminution of the offence,  but to a change in the attitude of the police. Again, in the year  1887, the Metropolitan police arrested 4,556 persons under the  provisions of the Vagrant and Poor Law Acts; but in the year 1888, the  number arrested by the same body under the same acts amounted to  7,052. It is perfectly obvious that this vast increase of apprehensions  was not owing to a corresponding increase in the number of rogues,  beggars, and vagrants; it was principally owing to the increased  stringency with which the Metropolitan police carried out the  provisions of the Vagrant and Poor Law Acts. An absolute proof of the  correctness of this statement is the fact that throughout the whole of  England there was a decrease in the number of persons proceeded  against in accordance with these acts. These examples will suffice to  show what an immense power the police have in regulating the volume of  certain classes of offences. In some countries they are called upon to  exercise this power in the direction of stringency; in other countries  it is exercised in the direction of leniency; and in the same country  its exercise, as we have just seen, varies according to the views of  whoever, for the time being, happens to have a voice in controlling  the action of the police. In these circumstances it is obviously  impossible to draw any accurate comparison between the lighter kinds  of offences in one country and the same class of offences in another.    In the case of the more serious offences against person and property,  the initiative of putting the law in motion rests chiefly with the  injured individual. The action of the individual in this respect  depends to a large extent on the customs of the country. In some  countries the injured person, instead of putting the law in motion  against an offender, takes the matter in his own hands, and  administers the wild justice of revenge. Great differences of opinion  also exist among different nations as to the gravity of certain  offences. Among some peoples there is a far greater reluctance than  there is among others to appeal to the law. Murder is perhaps the only  crime on which there exists a fair consensus of opinion among  civilised communities; and even with regard to this offence it is  impossible to overcome all the judicial and statistical difficulties  which stand in the way of an international comparison.    In spite, however, of the fact that the amount of crime committed in  civilised countries cannot be subjected to exact comparison, there are  various points on which the international statistics of crime are able  to render valuable service. It is important, for instance, to see in  what relation crime in different communities stands to age, sex,  climate, temperature, race, education, religion, occupation,"]]]
