[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16351"],[0,"Critical and Historical Essays (#2)"],[1,"an animal utters a cry of joy or pain it expresses its  emotions in more or less definite tones; and at some remote  period of the earth's history all primeval mankind must have  expressed its emotions in much the same manner. When this  inarticulate speech developed into the use of certain sounds as  symbols for emotions--emotions that otherwise would have been  expressed by the natural sounds occasioned by them--then we have  the beginnings of speech as distinguished from music, which  is still the universal language. In other words, intellectual  development begins with articulate speech, leaving music for  the expression of the emotions.    To symbolize the sounds used to express emotion, if I may so  put it, is to weaken that expression, and it would naturally  be the strongest emotion that would first feel the inadequacy  of the new-found speech. Now what is mankind's strongest  emotion? Even in the nineteenth century Goethe could say, \"'Tis  fear that constitutes the god-like in man.\" Certainly before  the Christian era the soul of mankind had its roots in fear.  In our superstition we were like children beneath a great tree  of which the upper part was as a vague and fascinating mystery,  but the roots holding it firmly to the ground were tangible,  palpable facts. We feared--we knew not what. Love was human,  all the other emotions were human; fear alone was indefinable.    The primeval savage, looking at the world subjectively, was  merely part of it. He might love, hate, threaten, kill, if he  willed; every other creature could do the same. But the wind  was a great spirit to him; lightning and thunder threatened him  as they did the rest of the world; the flood would destroy him  as ruthlessly as it tore the trees asunder. The elements were  animate powers that had nothing in common with him; for what  the intellect cannot explain the imagination magnifies.    Fear, then, was the strongest emotion. Therefore auxiliary aids  to express and cause fear were necessary when the speech symbols  for fear, drifting further and further away from expressing the  actual thing, became words, and words were inadequate to express  and cause fear. In that vague groping for sound symbols which  would cause and express fear far better than mere words, we  have the beginning of what is gradually to develop into music.    We all know that savage nations accompany their dances by  striking one object with another, sometimes by a clanking of  stones, the pounding of wood, or perhaps the clashing of stone  spearheads against wooden shields (a custom which extended until  the time when shields and spears were discarded), meaning thus  to express something that words cannot. This meaning changed  naturally from its original one of being the simple expression  of fear to that of welcoming a chieftain; and, if one wishes  to push the theory to excess, we may still see a shadowy  reminiscence of it in the manner in which the violinists of  an orchestra applaud an honoured guest--perchance some famous  virtuoso--at one of our symphony concerts by striking the  backs of their violins with their bows.    To go back to the savages. While this clashing of one object  against another could not be called the beginning of music, and  while it could not be said to originate a musical instrument,  it did, nevertheless, bring into existence music's greatest  prop, rhythm, an ally without which music would seem to be  impossible. It is hardly necessary to go into this point in  detail. Suffice it to say that the sense of rhythm is highly  developed even among those savage tribes which stand the  lowest in the scale of civilization to-day, for instance,  the Andaman Islanders, of whom I shall speak later; the same  may be said of the Tierra del Fuegians and the now extinct  aborigines of Tasmania; it is the same with the Semangs of  the Malay Peninsula, the Ajitas of the Philippines, and the  savages inhabiting the interior of Borneo.    As I have said, this more or less rhythmic clanking of stones  together, the striking of wooden paddles against the side of  a canoe, or the clashing of stone spearheads against wooden  shields, could not constitute the first musical instrument. But  when some savage first struck a hollow tree and found that  it gave forth a sound peculiar to itself, when he found a  hollow log and filled up the open ends, first with wood,  and then--possibly getting the idea from his hide-covered  shield--stretched skins across the two open ends, then he had  completed the first musical instrument known to man, namely,  the drum. And such as it was then, so is it now, with but  few modifications.    Up to this point it is reasonable to assume that primeval man  looked upon the world purely subjectively. He considered himself  merely a unit in the world, and felt on a plane with the other  creatures inhabiting it. But from the moment he had invented the  first musical instrument, the drum, he had created something  outside of nature, a voice that to himself and to all other  living creatures was intangible, an idol that spoke when it  was touched, something that he could call into life, something  that shared the supernatural in common with the elements. A  God had come to live with man, and thus was unfolded the  first leaf in that noble tree of life which we call religion.  Man now began to feel himself something apart from the world,  and to look at it objectively instead of subjectively.    To treat primitive mankind as a type, to put it under one head,  to make one theorem cover all mankind, as it were, seems almost  an unwarranted boldness. But I think it is warranted when we  consider that, aside from language, music is the very first  sign of the dawn of civilization. There is even the most  convincingly direct testimony in its favour. For instance:    In the Bay of Bengal, about six hundred miles from the Hoogly  mouth of the Ganges, lie the Andaman Islands. The savages  inhabiting these islands have the unenviable reputation  of being, in common with several other tribes, the nearest  approach to primeval man in existence. These islands and their  inhabitants have been known and feared since time immemorial;  our old friend Sinbad the Sailor, of \"Arabian Nights\" fame,  undoubtedly touched there on one of his voyages. These savages  have no religion whatever, except the vaguest superstition,  in other words, fear, and they have no musical instruments  of any kind. They have reached only the _rhythm_ stage, and  accompany such dances as they have by clapping their hands  or by stamping on the ground. Let us now look to Patagonia,  some thousands of miles distant. The Tierra del Fuegians have  precisely the same characteristics, no religion, and no musical  instruments of any kind. Retracing our steps to the Antipodes  we find among the Weddahs or \"wild hunters\" of Ceylon exactly  the same state of things. The same description applies without  distinction equally well to the natives in the interior of  Borneo, to the Semangs of the Malay Peninsula, and to the now  extinct aborigines of Tasmania. According to Virchow their  dance is demon worship of a purely anthropomorphic character;  no musical instrument of any kind was known to them. Even  the simple expression of emotions by the voice, which we have  seen is its most primitive medium, has not been replaced to  any extent among these races since their discovery of speech,  for the Tierra del Fuegians, Andamans, and Weddahs have but  one sound to represent emotion, namely, a cry to express joy;  having no other means for the expression of sorrow, they paint  themselves when mourning.    It is granted that all this, in itself, is not conclusive;  but it will be found that no matter in what wilderness one  may hear of a savage beating a drum, there also will be a  well-defined religion.    Proofs of the theory that the drum antedates all other musical  instruments are to be found on every hand. For wherever in the  anthropological history of the world we hear of the trumpet,  horn, flute, or other instrument of the pipe species, it will  be found that the drum and its derivatives were already well  known. The same may be said of the lyre species of instrument,  the forerunner of our guitar (_kithara_), _tebuni_ or Egyptian  harp, and generally all stringed instruments, with this  difference, namely, that wherever the lyre species was known,  both pipe and drum had preceded it. We never find the lyre  without the drum, or the pipe without the drum; neither do we  find the lyre and the drum without the pipe. On the other hand,  we often find the drum alone, or the drum and pipe without  the lyre. This certainly proves the antiquity of the drum and  its derivatives.    I have spoken of the purely rhythmical nature of the pre-drum  period, and pointed out, in contrast, the musical quality of  the drum. This may seem somewhat strange, accustomed as we are  to think of the drum as a purely rhythmical instrument. The  sounds given out by it seem at best vague in tone and more  or less uniform in quality. We forget that all instruments  of percussion, as they are called, are direct descendants of  the drum. The bells that hang in our church towers are but  modifications of the drum; for what is a bell but a metal drum  with one end left open and the drum stick hung inside?    Strange to say, as showing the marvellous potency of primeval  instincts, bells placed in church towers were supposed to  have much of the supernatural power that the savage in his  wilderness ascribed to the drum. We all know something of the  bell legends of the Middle Ages, how the tolling of a bell was  supposed to clear the air of the plague, to calm the storm, and  to shed a blessing on all who heard it. And this superstition  was to a certain extent ratified by the religious ceremonies  attending the casting of church bells and the inscriptions  moulded in them. For instance, the mid-day "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],[0,"The English Gipsies and Their Language (#2)"],[1,"subject.  It is merely  as a collection of material that I offer it; let those who can use it, do  what they will with it.    If I have not given in this book a sketch of the history of the Gipsies,  or statistics of their numbers, or accounts of their social condition in  different countries, it is because nearly everything of the kind may be  found in the works of George Borrow and Walter Simson, which are in all  respectable libraries, and may be obtained from any bookseller.    I would remark to any impatient reader for mere entertainment, who may  find fault with the abundance of Rommany or Gipsy language in the  following pages, that _the principal object of the Author was to collect  and preserve such specimens of a rapidly-vanishing language_, and that  the title-page itself indirectly indicates such an object.  I have,  however, invariably given with the Gipsy a translation immediately  following the text in plain English--at times very plain--in order that  the literal meaning of words may be readily apprehended.  I call especial  attention to this fact, so that no one may accuse me of encumbering my  pages with Rommany.    While writing this book, or in fact after the whole of the first part was  written, I passed a winter in Egypt; and as that country is still  supposed by many people to be the fatherland of the Gipsies, and as very  little is known relative to the Rommany there, I have taken the liberty  of communicating what I could learn on the subject, though it does not  refer directly to the Gipsies of England.  Those who are interested in  the latter will readily pardon the addition.    There are now in existence about three hundred works on the Gipsies, but  of the entire number comparatively few contain fresh material gathered  from the Rommany themselves.  Of late years the first philologists of  Europe have taken a great interest in their language, which is now  included in \"Die Sprachen Europas\" as the only Indian tongue spoken in  this quarter of the world; and I believe that English Gipsy is really the  only strongly-distinct Rommany dialect which has never as yet been  illustrated by copious specimens or a vocabulary of any extent.  I  therefore trust that the critical reader will make due allowances for the  very great difficulties under which I have laboured, and not blame me for  not having done better that which, so far as I can ascertain, would  possibly not have been done at all.  Within the memory of man the popular  Rommany of this country was really grammatical; that which is now spoken,  and from which I gathered the material for the following pages, is, as  the reader will observe, almost entirely English as to its structure,  although it still abounds in Hindu words to a far greater extent than has  been hitherto supposed.          CHAPTER I.  INTRODUCTORY.      The Rommany of the Roads.--The Secret of Vagabond Life in England.--Its  peculiar and thoroughly hidden Nature.--Gipsy Character and the Causes  which formed it.--Moral Results of hungry Marauding.--Gipsy ideas of  Religion.

Although the valuable and curious works of Mr George Borrow have been in  part for more than twenty years before the British public, {1} it may  still be doubted whether many, even of our scholars, are aware of the  remarkable, social, and philological facts which are connected with an  immense proportion of our out-of-door population.  There are, indeed,  very few people who know, that every time we look from the window into a  crowded street, the chances are greatly in favour of the assertion, that  we shall see at least one man who bears in his memory some hundreds of  Sanscrit roots, and that man English born; though it was probably in the  open air, and English bred, albeit his breeding was of the roads.    For go where you will, though you may not know it, you encounter at every  step, in one form or the other, _the Rommany_.  True, the dwellers in  tents are becoming few and far between, because the \"close cultivation\"  of the present generation, which has enclosed nearly all the waste land  in England, has left no spot in many a day's journey, where \"the  travellers,\" as they call themselves, can light the fire and boil the  kettle undisturbed.  There is almost \"no tan to hatch,\" or place to stay  in.  So it has come to pass, that those among them who cannot settle down  like unto the Gentiles, have gone across the Great Water to America,  which is their true Canaan, where they flourish mightily, the more  enterprising making a good thing of it, by _prastering graias_ or  \"running horses,\" or trading in them, while the idler or more moral ones,  pick up their living as easily as a mouse in a cheese, on the endless  roads and in the forests.  And so many of them have gone there, that I am  sure the child is now born, to whom the sight of a real old-fashioned  gipsy will be as rare in England as a Sioux or Pawnee warrior in the  streets of New York or Philadelphia.  But there is a modified and yet  real Rommany-dom, which lives and will live with great vigour, so long as  a regularly organised nomadic class exists on our roads--and it is the  true nature and inner life of this class which has remained for ages, an  impenetrable mystery to the world at large.  A member of it may be a  tramp and a beggar, the proprietor of some valuable travelling show, a  horse-dealer, or a tinker.  He may be eloquent, as a Cheap Jack, noisy as  a Punch, or musical with a fiddle at fairs.  He may \"peddle\" pottery,  make and sell skewers and clothes-pegs, or vend baskets in a caravan; he  may keep cock-shys and Aunt Sallys at races.  But whatever he may be,  depend upon it, reader, that among those who follow these and similar  callings which he represents, are literally many thousands who,  unsuspected by the _Gorgios_, are known to one another, and who still  speak among themselves, more or less, that curious old tongue which the  researches of the greatest living philologists have indicated, is in all  probability not merely allied to Sanscrit, but perhaps in point of age,  an elder though vagabond sister or cousin of that ancient language.    For THE ROMMANY is the characteristic leaven of all the real tramp life  and nomadic callings of Great Britain.  And by this word I mean not the  language alone, which is regarded, however, as a test of superior  knowledge of \"the roads,\" but a curious _inner life_ and freemasonry of  secret intelligence, ties of blood and information, useful to a class who  have much in common with one another, and very little in common with the  settled tradesman or worthy citizen.  The hawker whom you meet, and whose  blue eyes and light hair indicate no trace of Oriental blood, may not be  a _churdo_, or _pash-ratt_, or half-blood, or _half-scrag_, as a full  Gipsy might contemptuously term him, but he may be, of his kind, a  quadroon or octoroon, or he may have \"gipsified,\" by marrying a Gipsy  wife; and by the way be it said, such women make by far the best wives to  be found among English itinerants, and the best suited for \"a traveller.\"  But in any case he has taken pains to pick up all the Gipsy he can.  If  he is a tinker, he knows _Kennick_, or cant, or thieves' slang by nature,  but the Rommany, which has very few words in common with the former, is  the true language of the mysteries; in fact, it has with him become,  strangely enough, what it was originally, a sort of sacred Sanscrit,  known only to the Brahmins of the roads, compared to which the other  language is only commonplace _Prakrit_, which anybody may acquire.    He is proud of his knowledge, he makes of it a deep mystery; and if you,  a gentleman, ask him about it, he will probably deny that he ever heard  of its existence.  Should he be very thirsty, and your manners frank and  assuring, it is, however, not impossible that after draining a pot of  beer at your expense, he may recall, with a grin, the fact that he _has_  heard that the Gipsies have a queer kind of language of their own; and  then, if you have any Rommany yourself at command, he will perhaps  _rakker Rommanis_ with greater or less fluency.  Mr Simeon, in his  \"History of the Gipsies,\" asserts that there is not a tinker or scissors-  grinder in Great Britain who cannot talk this language, and my own  experience agrees with his declaration, to this extent--that they all  have some knowledge of it, or claim to have it, however slight it may be.    So rare is a knowledge of Rommany among those who are not connected in  some way with Gipsies, that the slightest indication of it is invariably  taken as an irrefutable proof of relationship with them.  It is but a few  weeks since, as I was walking along the Marine Parade in Brighton, I  overtook a tinker.  Wishing him to sharpen some tools for me, I directed  him to proceed to my home, and _en route_ spoke to him in Gipsy.  As he  was quite fair in complexion, I casually remarked, \"I should have never  supposed you could speak Rommany--you don't look like it.\"  To which he  replied, very gravely, in a tone as of gentle reproach, \"You don't look a  Gipsy yourself, sir; but you know you _are_ one--_you talk like one_.\"    Truly, the secret of the Rommany has been well kept in England.  It seems  so to me when I reflect that, with the exception of Lavengro and the  Rommany Rye, {5} I cannot recall a single novel, in our language, in  which the writer has shown familiarity with the _real_ life, habits, or  language of the vast majority of that very large class, the itinerants of  the roads.  Mr Dickens has set before us Cheap Jacks, and a number of men  who were, in their very face, of the class of which I speak; but I cannot  recall in his writings any indication that he knew that these men had a  singular "]]]
