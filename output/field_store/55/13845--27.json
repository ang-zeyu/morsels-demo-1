House, one of the by-standers. Upon the noise of       this strange incident, the cruel bailiff returned command       that the poor infant must be cast again into the flames,       which was accordingly performed; and so that pretty babe was       born a martyr, and added to the number of the holy       innocents.    Parsons, the English Jesuit, has asserted that the women were felons  and were executed for theft, while other apologists have described  them as prostitutes and generally infamous in character. The original  sentences, however, which still exist at the Guernsey _Greffe_, and  which I have examined, conclusively settle the question. Both the  ecclesiastical sentence, which is in Latin, and the civil sentence,  which is in French, distinctly describe the charge as one of _heresy_,  and make no mention whatever of any other crime as having aught to do  with the condemnation.    It has been questioned too whether a child could be born alive under  such circumstances. Mr. F.B. Tupper, in his _History of Guernsey_  (page 151), says: \"We are assured by competent surgical authority that  the case is very possible\"; and he further mentions that in a volume  entitled _Three Visits to Madagascar_, by the Rev. Wm. Ellis,  published in London, in 1858, a precisely similar case is stated to  have occurred in that island. A native woman was burnt for becoming a  convert to Christianity, and her infant, born in the flames, was  thrust into them again, and burnt also.    Lord Tennyson refers to this Guernsey martyrdom in his historical  drama of _Queen Mary_ (Act v. Scene iv.). It is night-time in London;  a light is burning in the Royal Palace; and he makes two \"Voices of  the Night\" say:--    _First_:--There's the Queen's light. I hear she cannot live.    _Second_:--God curse her and her Legate! Gardiner burns  Already; but to pay them full in kind,  The hottest hold in all the devil's den  Were but a sort of winter; Sir, in Guernsey,  I watch'd a woman burn; and in her agony  The mother came upon her--a child was born--  And, Sir, they hurl'd it back into the fire,  That, being thus baptised in fire, the babe  Might be in fire for ever. Ah, good neighbour,  There should be something fierier than fire  To yield them their deserts.    With regard to Witchcraft in Jersey, I have not had an opportunity of  personally examining the official records there. I find, however, some  information on the subject, given by M. De La Croix, in his _Ville de  St. Helier_, and _Les Etats de Jersey_, upon which I have drawn. In  the way of legislation, the Guernsey Court does not appear to have  promulgated any penal statutes on the subject, being content to treat  the crime as one against the common law of the Island. In Jersey on  the contrary, Witchcraft was specially legislated against at least on  one occasion, for we find that on December 23rd, 1591, the Royal Court  of that island passed an Ordinance, of which the following is the  purport:--         Forasmuch as many persons have hitherto committed and       perpetrated great and grievous faults, as well against the       honour and express commandment of God as to the great       scandal of the Christian faith, and of those who are charged       with the administration of justice, by seeking assistance       from Witches and Diviners in their ills and afflictions; and       seeing that ignorance is no excuse for sin, and that no one       can tell what vice and danger may ensue from such practices:       This Act declares that for the time to come everyone shall       turn away from such iniquitous and diabolical practices,       against which the law of God decrees the same punishments as       against Witches and Enchanters themselves; and also in       order that the Divine Vengeance may be averted, which on       account of the impunity with which these crimes have been       committed, now threatens those who have the repression of       them in their hands. It is, therefore, strictly forbidden to       all the inhabitants of this island to receive any counsel or       assistance in their adversities from any Witches or       Diviners, or anyone suspected of practicing Sorcery, under       pain of one month's imprisonment in the Castle, on bread and       water; and on their liberation they shall declare to the       Court the cause of such presumption, and according as this       shall appear reasonable, shall be dealt with as the law of       God directs.    In 1562 two women were executed in Jersey for witchcraft. One of them  named _Anne_, a native of St. Brelade's, was burnt at St. Helier's;  and the other, _Michelle La Blanche_, expiated her crime at the gibbet  of the Hurets, in the parish of St. Ouen, because criminals dwelling  on the Fief Haubert de St. Ouen, were, in accordance with custom,  required to be executed within the boundaries of the said Fief--seeing  that it possessed a gallows-right--and their goods and lands became  forfeited to the Seigneur.    In 1583 a rather curious point of law was raised in connection with a  pending witch-trial at St. Helier's. On the 15th of February in that  year, a suspected witch named _Marion Corbel_, who had been imprisoned  in the Castle awaiting her trial, suddenly died. Whereupon her  relatives came forward and claimed to be heirs to her goods and  chattles, seeing that she had not been convicted of the imputed crime,  and urging that her death put an end to further criminal proceedings.  The Queen's Procureur, however--it was in the reign of  Elizabeth--contended that death was no bar to the completion of the  indictment, although it had effectually removed the criminal from the  jurisdiction of the Court, as far as punishment was concerned. The  very reasonable claim of the deceased woman's relatives was therefore  set aside, and the defunct of course being found guilty, her  possessions reverted to the crown.    Again, forty years later, in 1623, an old woman of sixty, named _Marie  Filleul_, daughter of _Thomas Filleul_, of the parish of St.  Clement's, was tried before a jury of twenty-four of her countrymen,  and found guilty of the diabolical crime of Sorcery. She was therefore  hanged and burnt as a witch, and her goods were confiscated to the  King [James I.], and to the Seigneurs to whom they belonged.    It may be interesting to note here the opinion of Mr. Philippe Le  Geyt, the famous commentator on the constitution and laws of Jersey,  and one of the most enlightened men of his time, who for many years  was Lieutenant-Bailiff of that island. He was born in 1635 and died in  1715, in his eighty-first year. In Vol. I., page 42, of his works,  there occurs a passage of which the following is a translation:--         As Holy Scripture forbids us to allow witches to live, many       persons have made it a matter of conscience and of religion       to be severe in respect to such a crime. This principle has       without doubt made many persons credulous. How often have       purely accidental associations been taken as convincing       proofs? How many innocent people have perished in the flames       on the asserted testimony of supernatural circumstances? I       will not say that there are no witches; but ever since the       difficulty of convicting them has been recognized in the       island, they all seem to have disappeared, as though the       evidence of the times gone by had been but an illusion. This       shows the instability of all things here below.    Coming down now to within a century ago, we find an article in the  _Gazette de Jersey_, of Saturday, March 10th, 1787, complaining of the  great increase of wizards and witches in the island, as well as of  their supposed victims. The writer says that the scenes then taking  place were truly ridiculous, and he details a case that had just  occurred at St. Brelade's as corroborative of his assertion. It  appears that a worthy householder there, had dreamed that a certain  wizard appeared to him and ordered him to poison himself at a date  which was specified, enjoining him above all things not to mention the  incident to anyone. The poor silly fellow was dreadfully distressed,  for he felt convinced that he would have to carry out the disagreeable  command. At the same time he was quite unable to keep so momentous a  secret to himself, and so he divulged the approaching tragedy to his  wife. The good woman's despair was fully equal to his own, and after  much anxious domestic counsel they determined to seek the good offices  of a White Witch (_une Queraude_), with the hope that her incantations  might overcome the evil spells of the Black Witch who was causing all  the mischief. This White Witch prescribed lengthened fasting and other  preparations for the great ordeal, and on a given night she and the  bewitched householder, together with his wife and four or five trusty  friends with drawn swords, shut themselves up in a room, and commenced  their mysterious ceremonial. There was the boiling of occult herbs;  the roasting of a beeve's heart stuck full of nails and pins; the  reading of certain passages from the family Bible; a mighty  gesticulating with the swords, which were first thrust up the chimney  to prevent the Black Witch from coming down, and anon were pointed  earthward to hinder him from rising up; and so the ridiculous game  went on. The only person who benefited was of course the imposter, who  was paid for her services; while we may perhaps charitably hope that  her dupes also were afterwards easier in their minds. The writer adds  that many other persons besides this man at St. Brelade's, had  latterly believed themselves bewitched, and had"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17208"],[0,"The Tales of Mother Goose (#2)"],[1,"cloth of gold and silver, all decked with  jewels. This done, she gave her a pair of the prettiest glass slippers  in the whole world. Being thus attired, she got into the carriage, her  godmother commanding her, above all things, not to stay till after  midnight, and telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed one  moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice, her  coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes would become just  as they were before.    She promised her godmother she would not fail to leave the ball before  midnight. She drove away, scarce able to contain herself for joy. The  King's son, who was told that a great princess, whom nobody knew, was  come, ran out to receive her. He gave her his hand as she alighted from  the coach, and led her into the hall where the company were assembled.  There was at once a profound silence; every one left off dancing, and  the violins ceased to play, so attracted was every one by the singular  beauties of the unknown newcomer. Nothing was then heard but a confused  sound of voices saying:--    \"Ha! how beautiful she is! Ha! how beautiful she is!\"    The King himself, old as he was, could not keep his eyes off her, and he  told the Queen under his breath that it was a long time since he had  seen so beautiful and lovely a creature.    All the ladies were busy studying her clothes and head-dress, so that  they might have theirs made next day after the same pattern, provided  they could meet with such fine materials and able hands to make them.    The King's son conducted her to the seat of honor, and afterwards took  her out to dance with him. She danced so very gracefully that they all  admired her more and more. A fine collation was served, but the young  Prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he occupied with her.    She went and sat down beside her sisters, showing them a thousand  civilities, and giving them among other things part of the oranges and  citrons with which the Prince had regaled her. This very much surprised  them, for they had not been presented to her.    Cinderella heard the clock strike a quarter to twelve. She at once made  her adieus to the company and hastened away as fast as she could.    As soon as she got home, she ran to find her godmother, and, after  having thanked her, she said she much wished she might go to the ball  the next day, because the King's son had asked her to do so. As she was  eagerly telling her godmother all that happened at the ball, her two  sisters knocked at the door; Cinderella opened it. \"How long you have  stayed!\" said she, yawning, rubbing her eyes, and stretching herself as  if she had been just awakened. She had not, however, had any desire to  sleep since they went from home.    \"If you had been at the ball,\" said one of her sisters, \"you would not  have been tired with it. There came thither the finest princess, the  most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes. She showed us a thousand  civilities, and gave us oranges and citrons.\"    Cinderella did not show any pleasure at this. Indeed, she asked them the  name of the princess; but they told her they did not know it, and that  the King's son was very much concerned, and would give all the world to  know who she was. At this Cinderella, smiling, replied:--    \"Was she then so very beautiful? How fortunate you have been! Could I  not see her? Ah! dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow suit of  clothes which you wear every day.\"    \"Ay, to be sure!\" cried Miss Charlotte; \"lend my clothes to such a dirty  Cinderwench as thou art! I should be out of my mind to do so.\"    Cinderella, indeed, expected such an answer and was very glad of the  refusal; for she would have been sadly troubled if her sister had lent  her what she jestingly asked for. The next day the two sisters went to  the ball, and so did Cinderella, but dressed more magnificently than  before. The King's son was always by her side, and his pretty speeches  to her never ceased. These by no means annoyed the young lady. Indeed,  she quite forgot her godmother's orders to her, so that she heard the  clock begin to strike twelve when she thought it could not be more than  eleven. She then rose up and fled, as nimble as a deer. The Prince  followed, but could not overtake her. She left behind one of her glass  slippers, which the Prince took up most carefully. She got home, but  quite out of breath, without her carriage, and in her old clothes,  having nothing left her of all her finery but one of the little  slippers, fellow to the one she had dropped. The guards at the palace  gate were asked if they had not seen a princess go out, and they replied  they had seen nobody go out but a young girl, very meanly dressed, and  who had more the air of a poor country girl than of a young lady.    When the two sisters returned from the ball, Cinderella asked them if  they had had a pleasant time, and if the fine lady had been there. They  told her, yes; but that she hurried away the moment it struck twelve,  and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass  slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the King's son had taken up.  They said, further, that he had done nothing but look at her all the  time, and that most certainly he was very much in love with the  beautiful owner of the glass slipper.    What they said was true; for a few days after the King's son caused it  to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her whose  foot this slipper would fit exactly. They began to try it on the  princesses, then on the duchesses, and then on all the ladies of the  Court; but in vain. It was brought to the two sisters, who did all they  possibly could to thrust a foot into the slipper, but they could not  succeed. Cinderella, who saw this, and knew her slipper, said to them,  laughing:--    \"Let me see if it will not fit me.\"    Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to banter her. The gentleman  who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and,  finding her very handsome, said it was but just that she should try, and  that he had orders to let every lady try it on.    He obliged Cinderella to sit down, and, putting the slipper to her  little foot, he found it went on very easily, and fitted her as if it  had been made of wax. The astonishment of her two sisters was great, but  it was still greater when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket the other  slipper and put it on her foot. Thereupon, in came her godmother, who,  having touched Cinderella's clothes with her wand, made them more  magnificent than those she had worn before.    [Illustration: \"IT WENT ON VERY EASILY.\" p. 10.]    And now her two sisters found her to be that beautiful lady they had  seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg pardon for  all their ill treatment of her. Cinderella took them up, and, as she  embraced them, said that she forgave them with all her heart, and begged  them to love her always.    She was conducted to the young Prince, dressed as she was. He thought  her more charming than ever, and, a few days after, married her.  Cinderella, who was as good as she was beautiful, gave her two sisters a  home in the palace, and that very same day married them to two great  lords of the Court.          THE SLEEPING BEAUTY IN THE WOODS.      Once upon a time there was a king and a queen, who were very sorry that  they had no children,--so sorry that it cannot be told.    At last, however, the Queen had a daughter. There was a very fine  christening; and the Princess had for her godmothers all the fairies  they could find in the whole kingdom (there were seven of them), so that  every one of them might confer a gift upon her, as was the custom of  fairies in those days. By this means the Princess had all the  perfections imaginable.    After the christening was over, the company returned to the King's  palace, where was prepared a great feast for the fairies. There was  placed before every one of them a magnificent cover with a case of  massive gold, wherein were a spoon, and a knife and fork, all of pure  gold set with diamonds and rubies. But as they were all sitting down at  table they saw a very old fairy come into the hall. She had not been  invited, because for more than fifty years she had not been out of a  certain tower, and she was believed to be either dead or enchanted.    The King ordered her a cover, but he could not give her a case of gold  as the others had, because seven only had been made for the seven  fairies. The old fairy fancied she was slighted, and muttered threats  between her teeth. One of the young fairies who sat near heard her, and,  judging that she might give the little Princess some unlucky gift, hid  herself behind the curtains as soon as they left the table. She hoped  that she might speak last and undo as much as she could the evil which  the old fairy might do.    In the meanwhile all the fairies began to give their gifts to the  Princess. The youngest gave her for her gift that she should be the most  beautiful person in the world; the next, that she should have the wit of  an angel; the third, that she should be able to do everything she did  gracefully; the fourth, that she should dance perfectly; the fifth, that  she should sing like a nightingale; and the sixth, that she should play  all kinds of musical instruments to the fullest perfection.    The old fairy's turn coming next, her head shaking more with spite than  with age, she said that the Princess should pierce her hand with a  spindle and die of the wound. This terrible gift made the whole company  tremble, and everybody fell a-crying.    At this very instant the young fairy came from behind the curtains and  said these words in a loud voice:--    \"Assure yourselves, O King and Queen, that your daughter shall not die  of this disaster. It is true, I have no power to undo entirely what my  elder has done. The Princess "]]]
