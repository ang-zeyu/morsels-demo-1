Of course they missed  those fresh eggs and of course they blamed Reddy Fox.    \"Never mind,\" said Jimmy Skunk, scowling down on the Green Meadows where  Reddy Fox was taking a sun bath, \"Farmer Brown's boy will get him yet!  I hope he does!\" Jimmy said this a little spitefully and just as if he  really meant it.    Now when people think that they are very, very smart, they like to show  off. You know it isn't any fun at all to feel smart unless others can  see how smart you are. So Reddy Fox, just to show off, grew very bold,  very bold indeed. He actually went up to Farmer Brown's henyard in broad  daylight, and almost under the nose of Bowser the Hound he caught the  pet chicken of Farmer Brown's boy. 'Ol Mistah Buzzard, sailing overhead  high up in the blue, blue sky, saw Reddy Fox and shook his bald head:    \"Ah see Trouble on the way; Yes, Ah do! Yes, Ah do! Hope it ain't  a-gwine to stay; Yes, Ah do! Yes, Ah do! Trouble am a spry ol' man,  Bound to find yo' if he can; If he finds yo' bound to stick. When Ah  sees him, Ah runs quick! Yes, Ah do! Yes, Ah do!\"    But Reddy Fox thought himself so smart that it seemed as if he really  were hunting for Ol' Mr. Trouble. And when he caught the pet chicken of  Farmer Brown's boy, Ol' Mr. Trouble was right at his heels.          V. Reddy Grows Careless    Ol' Mistah Buzzard was right. Trouble was right at the heels of Reddy  Fox, although Reddy wouldn't have believed it if he had been told. He  had stolen that plump pet chicken of Farmer Brown's boy for no reason  under the sun but to show off. He wanted everyone to know how bold he  was. He thought himself so smart that he could do just exactly what he  pleased and no one could stop him. He liked to strut around through the  Green Forest and over the Green Meadows and brag about what he had done  and what he could do.    Now people who brag and boast and who like to show off are almost sure  to come to grief. And when they do, very few people are sorry for them.  None of the little meadow and forest people liked Reddy Fox, anyway, and  they were getting so tired of his boasting that they just ached to see  him get into trouble. Yes, Sir, they just ached to see Reddy get into  trouble.    Peter Rabbit, happy-go-lucky Peter Rabbit, shook his head gravely when  he heard how Reddy had stolen that pet chicken of Farmer Brown's boy,  and was boasting about it to everyone.    \"Reddy Fox is getting so puffed up that pretty soon he won't be able to  see his own feet,\" said Peter Rabbit.    \"Well, what if he doesn't?\" demanded Jimmy Skunk.    Peter looked at Jimmy in disgust:    \"He comes to grief, however fleet, Who doesn't watch his flying feet.    \"Jimmy Skunk, if you didn't have that little bag of scent that everybody  is afraid of, you would be a lot more careful where you step,\" replied  Peter. \"If Reddy doesn't watch out, someday he'll step right into a  trap.\"    Jimmy Skunk chuckled. \"I wish he would!\" said he.    Now when Farmer Brown's boy heard about the boldness of Reddy Fox, he  shut his mouth tight in a way that was unpleasant to see and reached for  his gun. \"I can't afford to raise chickens to feed foxes!\" said he.  Then he whistled for Bowser the Hound, and together they started out. It  wasn't long before Bowser found Reddy's tracks.    \"Bow, wow, wow, wow!\" roared Bowser the Hound.    Reddy Fox, taking a nap on the edge of the Green Forest, heard Bowser's  big, deep voice. He pricked up his ears, then he grinned. \"I feel just  like a good run today,\" said he, and trotted off along the Crooked  Little Path down the hill.    Now this was a beautiful summer day and Reddy knew that in summer men  and boys seldom hunt foxes. \"It's only Bowser the Hound,\" thought Reddy,  \"and when I've had a good run, I'll play a trick on him so that he will  lose my track.\" So Reddy didn't use his eyes as he should have done. You  see, he thought himself so smart that he had grown careless. Yes, Sir,  Reddy Fox had grown careless. He kept looking back to see where Bowser  the Hound was, but didn't look around to make sure that no other danger  was near.    Ol' Mistah Buzzard, sailing round and round, way up in the blue, blue  sky, could see everything going on down below. He could see Reddy  Fox running along the edge of the Green Forest and every few minutes  stopping to chuckle and listen to Bowser the Hound trying to pick out  the trail Reddy had made so hard to follow by his twists and turns. And  he saw something else, did Ol' Mistah Buzzard. It looked to him very  much like the barrel of a gun sticking out from behind an old tree just  ahead of Reddy.    \"Ah reckon it's just like Ah said: Reddy Fox is gwine to meet trouble  right smart soon,\" muttered Ol' Mistah Buzzard.          VI. Drummer the Woodpecker Drums in Vain    Once upon a time, before he had grown to think himself so very, very  smart, Reddy Fox would never, never have thought of running without  watching out in every direction. He would have seen that thing that  looked like the barrel of a gun sticking out from behind the old tree  toward which he was running, and he would have been very suspicious,  very suspicious indeed. But now all Reddy could think of was what a  splendid chance he had to show all the little meadow and forest people  what a bold, smart fellow he was.    So once more Reddy sat down and waited until Bowser the Hound was almost  up to him. Just then Drummer the Woodpecker began to make a tremendous  noise--rat-a-tat-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat! Now  everybody who heard that rat-a-tat-tat-tat knew that it was a danger  signal. Drummer the Woodpecker never drums just that way for pleasure.  But Reddy Fox paid no attention to it. He didn't notice it at all. You  see, he was so full of the idea of his own smartness that he didn't have  room for anything else.    \"Stupid thing!\" said Drummer the Woodpecker to himself. \"I don't know  what I am trying to warn him for, anyway. The Green Meadows and the  Green Forest would be better off without him, a lot better off! Nobody  likes him. He's a dreadful bully and is all the time trying to catch or  scare to death those who are smaller than he. Still, he is so handsome!\"  Drummer cocked his head on one side and looked over at Reddy Fox.    Reddy was laughing to see how hard Bowser the Hound was working to  untangle Reddy's mixed-up trail.    \"Yes, Sir, he certainly is handsome,\" said Drummer once more.    Then he looked down at the foot of the old tree on which he was sitting,  and what he saw caused Drummer to make up his mind. \"I surely would miss  seeing that beautiful red coat of his! I surely would!\" he muttered. \"If  he doesn't hear and heed now, it won't be my fault!\" Then Drummer the  Woodpecker began such a furious rat-a-tat-tat-tat on the trunk of the  old tree that it rang through the Green Forest and out across the Green  Meadows almost to the Purple Hills.    Down at the foot of the tree a freckled face on which there was a black  scowl looked up. It was the face of Farmer Brown's boy.    \"What ails that pesky woodpecker?\" he muttered. \"If he doesn't keep  still, he'll scare that fox!\"    He shook a fist at Drummer, but Drummer didn't appear to notice. He kept  right on, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat!          VII. Too Late Reddy Fox Hears    Drummer the Woodpecker was pounding out his danger signal so fast and  so hard that his red head flew back and forth almost too fast to see.  Rat-a-tat-tat-a-tat-tat, beat Drummer on the old tree trunk on the edge  of the Green Forest. When he stopped for breath, he looked down into the  scowling face of Farmer Brown's boy, who was hiding behind the old tree  trunk.    Drummer didn't like the looks of that scowl, not a bit. And he didn't  like the looks of the gun which Farmer Brown's boy had. He knew that  Farmer Brown's boy was hiding there to shoot Reddy Fox, but Drummer was  beginning to be afraid that Farmer Brown's boy might guess what all  that drumming meant--that it was a warning to Reddy Fox. And if Farmer  Brown's boy did guess that, why--why--anyway, on the other side of the  tree there was a better place to drum. So Drummer the Woodpecker crept  around to the other side of the tree and in a minute was drumming harder  than ever. Whenever he stopped for breath, he looked out over the Green  Meadows to see if Reddy Fox had heard his warning.    But if Reddy had heard, he hadn't heeded. Just to show off before all  the little meadow and forest people, Reddy had waited until Bowser the  Hound had almost reached him. Then, with a saucy flirt of his tail,  Reddy Fox started to show how fast he could run, and that is very fast  indeed. It made Bowser the Hound seem very slow, as, with his nose to  the ground, he came racing after Reddy, making a tremendous noise with  his great voice.    Now Reddy Fox had grown as careless as he had grown bold. Instead of  looking sharply ahead, he looked this way and that way to see who was  watching and admiring him. So he took no note of where he was going and  started straight for the old tree trunk on which Drummer the Woodpecker  was pounding out his warning of danger.    Now Reddy Fox has sharp eyes and very quick ears. My, my, indeed he has!  But just now Reddy was as deaf as if he had cotton stuffed in his ears.  He was chuckling to himself to think how he was going to fool Bowser the  Hound and how smart everyone would think him, when all of a sudden, he  heard the rat-a-tat-tata-tat-tat of Drummer the Woodpecker and knew that  that meant \"Danger!\"    For just a wee little second it seemed to Reddy Fox that his heart  stopped beating. He couldn't stop running, for he had let Bowser  the Hound get too close for that. Reddy's sharp eyes saw Drummer the  Woodpecker near the top of the old tree trunk and noticed that Drummer  seemed to be looking at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18253"],[0,"Discovery of Witches (#2)"],[1,"fail to find it in  the pages of Roger North, who has depicted his character with a  strength and accuracy of outline which no Vandyck or Lely of biography  ever surpassed. Would that we could exchange some of those \"faultless  monsters\" with which that fascinating department of literature too  much abounds, for a few more such instantly recognised specimens of  true but erring and unequal humanity, which are as rare as they are  precious. In the unabridged life of Lord Guildford by Roger North,  which, with his own most interesting and yet unpublished  autobiography, are in my possession in his autograph, are found some  additional touches which confirm the general accuracy of the portrait  he has sketched of Hale in the work which has been printed. (Vide  North's _Life of Lord Guildford_, by Roscoe, vol. i. p. 119.)]    [Footnote 7: See his _Dialogue on the Common Laws of England_.]    [Footnote 8: Dr. Cudworth was the friend whom More refers to without  naming, _Collections of Relations_, p. 336, edit. 1726, 8vo.]    [Footnote 9: There is no name in this catalogue that excites more  poignant regret than that of Dr. Henry More. So exalted was his  character, so serene and admirable his temper, so full of harmony his  whole intellectual constitution, that, irradiated at once by all the  lights of religion and philosophy, and with clearer glimpses of the  land of vision and the glories behind the veil than perhaps uninspired  mortality ever partook of before, he seems to have reached as near to  the full standard of perfection as it is possible for frail and feeble  humanity to attain. Dr. Outram said that he looked upon Dr. More as  the holiest person upon the face of the earth; and the sceptical  Hobbes, who never dealt in compliment, observed, \"That if his own  philosophy were not true, he knew of none that he should sooner like  than More's of Cambridge.\" His biographer, Ward, concludes his life in  the following glowing terms:--\"Thus lived and died the eminent Dr.  More: thus set this bright and illustrious star, vanishing by degrees  out of our sight after, to the surprise and admiration of many, (like  that which was observed in Cassiopeia's chair,) it had illuminated, as  it were, both worlds so long at once.\" At the lapse of many years I  have not forgotten the impassioned fondness with which the late and  most lamented Robert Southey dwelt upon the memory of the Cambridge  Plato, or the delight with which he greeted some works of his  favourite author which I was fortunate enough to point out to him,  with which he had not been previously acquainted. The sad reverse of  the picture will he seen by those who consult the folio of More's  philosophical works and Glanville's _Sadducismus Triumphatus_, the  greatest part of which is derived from More's _Collections_. His  hallucinations on the subject of witchcraft, from which none of the  English writers of the Platonic school were exempt, are the more  extraordinary, as a sister error, judicial astrology, met in More with  its most able oppugner. His tract, which has excited much less  attention than its merit deserves, (I have not been able to trace a  single quotation from it in any author during the last century,) is  entitled \"Tetractys Anti-astrologica, or a Confutation of Astrology.\"  Lond. 1681, 4to. I may mention while on the subject of More, that the  second and most valuable part of the memoir of him by Ward, his  devoted admirer and pupil, which was never printed, is in my  possession, in manuscript.]    [Footnote 10: See Boyle's letter on the subject of the latter, in the  5th vol. of the folio edition of his works.]    [Footnote 11: I have always considered the conclusion of Bodin's book,  _De Republica_, the accumulative grandeur of which is even heightened  in Knolles's admirable English translation, as the finest peroration  to be found in any work on government. Those who are fortunate enough  to possess a copy of his interdicted _Examination of Religions_, the  title of which is, \"Colloquium heptaplomeres de abditis sublimium  rerum arcanis, libris 6 digestum,\" which was never printed, and of  which very few MSS. copies are in existence, are well aware how little  he felt himself shackled in the spirit of examination which he carried  into the most sacred subjects by any respect for popular notions or  received systems or great authorities. My MS. copy of this  extraordinary work, which came from Heber's Collection, is contained  in two rather thick folio volumes.]    [Footnote 12: Few authors are better deserving of an extended  biography, a desideratum which, in an age characterised by its want of  literary research, is not likely to be soon supplied, than Thomas  Erastus, whose theological, philosophical, and medical celebrity  entitle him to rank with the greatest men of his century. At present  we have to collect all that is known of his life from various  scattered and contradictory sources. John Webster, in his _Displaying  of Supposed Witchcraft_, contrary to the usual candour and fairness of  his judgments, speaks slightingly of Erastus. There was, however, a  sufficient reason for this. Erastus had shown up the empiricism of  Webster's idol Paracelsus, and was in great disfavour with the writers  of the Anti-Galenic school.]    [Footnote 13: I cannot concur with Mr. Hallam in the extremely low  estimate he forms of the literary merit of Bodin's _Demomanie_, which  he does not seem to have examined with the care and impartiality which  he seldom is deficient in. Like all Bodin's works, it has a spirit  peculiarly his own, and is, in my opinion, one of the most  entertaining books to be found in the circle of Demonology.]    In his treatise _De Lamiis_, published in 1577, 8vo., he defends  nearly all the absurdities of the system with a blind zealotry which  in such a man is very remarkable. His book has accordingly taken its  place on the same shelf with Sprenger, Remigius, Delrio, and De  Lancre, and deserves insertion only in a list which has yet to be made  out, and which if accurately compiled would be a literary curiosity,  of the singularly illogical books of singularly able reasoners.  What was left unaccomplished by the centurions of literature came  ultimately from the strangest of all possible quarters; from the  study of an humble pupil of the transmuter of metals and prince  of mountebanks and quacks--the expounder of Reuchlin _de verbo  mirifico_, and lecturer in the unknown tongues--the follower of  Trismegistus--cursed with bell, book and candle, by every decorous  Church in Christendom--the redoubted Cornelius Agrippa; who, if he  left not to his pupil Wierus the secret of the philosopher's stone or  grand elixir, seems to have communicated a treasure perhaps equally  rare and not less precious, the faculty of seeing a truth which should  open the eyes of bigotry and dispel the mists of superstition, which  should stop the persecution of the helpless and stay the call for  blood. If, in working out this virgin ore from the mine, he has  produced it mixed up with the _scoria_ of his master's _Occult  Philosophy_; if he gives us catalogues of devils and spirits, with  whose acquaintance we could have dispensed; if he pleads the great  truth faintly, inconsistently, imperfectly, and is evidently unaware  of the strength of the weapons he wields; these deductions do not the  less entitle Wierus to take his place in the first rank of Humanity's  honoured professors, the true philanthropists and noble benefactors of  mankind.    In our own country, it may be curious and edifying to observe to whom  we mainly owe those enlightened views on this subject, which might  have been expected to proceed in their natural channel, but for which  we look in vain, from the \"triumphant heirs of universal praise,\" the  recognized guides of public opinion, whose fame sheds such a lustre on  our annals,--the Bacons, the Raleighs, the Seldens, the Cudworths, and  the Boyles.    The strangely assorted and rather grotesque band to whom we are  principally indebted for a vindication of outraged common sense and  insulted humanity in this instance, and whose vigorous exposition of  the absurdities of the prevailing system, in combination with other  lights and sources of intelligence, led at last to its being  universally abandoned, consists of four individuals--on any of whom a  literary Pharisee would look down with supercilious scorn:--a country  gentleman, devoted to husbandry, and deep in platforms of hop  gardens,[14]--a baronet, whose name for upwards of a century has been  used as a synonyme for incurable political bigotry,[15]--a little,  crooked, and now forgotten man, who died, as his biographer tells us,  \"distracted, occasioned by a deep conceit of his own parts, and by a  continual bibbing of strong and high tasted liquors,\"[16]--and last,  but not least assuredly, of one who was by turns a fanatical preacher  and an obscure practitioner of physic, and who passed his old age at  Clitheroe in Lancashire in attempting to transmute metals and discover  the philosopher's stone.[17] So strange a band of Apostles of reason  may occasion a smile; it deserves, at all events, a little more  particular consideration before we address ourselves to the short  narration which may be deemed necessary as an introduction to the  republication which follows.    Of the first of the number, Reginald or Reynold Scot, it is to be  regretted that more particulars are not known. Nearly the whole are  contained in the following information afforded by Anthony a Wood,  _Athenae._, vol. i. p. 297; from which it appears that he took to  \"solid reading\" at a crisis of life when it is generally thrown aside.  \"Reynolde Scot, a younger son of Sir John Scot, of Scot's Hall, near  to Smeeth, in Kent, by his wife, daughter of Reynolde Pimp, of Pimp's  Court, Knight, was born in that county, and at about 17 years of age  was sent to Oxon, particularly"]]]
