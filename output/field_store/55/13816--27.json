These will be glanced at in their  proper place; but for our present purpose they are all subordinate  to the one great paramount consideration--the economic one. In the  world of affairs experience shows that, given a demand of any kind  whatever, as between an economical method of supplying that demand and a  non-economical method, in the long run the economical method will surely  prevail.    If, then, it can be shown that there is a growing need for means of  international communication, and that a unilingual solution is more  economical than a multilingual one, there is good ground for thinking  that the unilingual method of transacting international affairs will  surely prevail. It then becomes a question of time and method: When will  men feel the pressure of the demand sufficiently strongly to set about  supplying it? and what means will they adopt?    The time and the method are by no means indifferent. Though a demand  (for what is possible) is sure, in the long run, to get itself supplied,  a long period of wasteful and needless groping may be avoided by a  clear-sighted and timely realization of the demand, and by consequent  organized co-operation in supplying it. Intelligent anticipation  sometimes helps events to occur. It is the object of this book to  call attention to the present state of affairs, and to emphasize the  fact that the time is now ripe for dealing with the question, and the  present moment propitious for solving the problem once for all in an  orderly way. The merest glance at the list of projects for a universal  language[1] and their dates will strengthen the conviction from an  historical point of view that the fulness of time is accomplished, while  the history of the rise and fall of _Volapük_ and of the extraordinary  rise of _Esperanto_, in spite of its precursor's failure, are exceedingly  significant.       [1]See pp. 78-87. [Part II, Chapter II]    One language has been born, come to maturity, and died of dissension,  and the world stood by indifferent. Another is now in the first full  flush of youth and strength. After twenty-nine years of daily developing  cosmopolitanism--years that have witnessed the rising of a new star in  the East and an uninterrupted growth of interchange of ideas between  the nations of the earth, whether in politics, literature, or science,  without a single check to the ever-rising tide of internationalism--are  we again to let the favourable moment pass unused, just for want of  making up our minds? At present one language holds the field. It is  well organized; it has abundant enthusiastic partisans accustomed to  communicate and transact their common business in it, and only too  anxious to show the way to others. If it be not officially adopted and  put under the regulation of a duly constituted international authority,  it may wither away or split into factions as Volapük did.[1] Or it may  continue to grow and flourish, but others of its numerous rivals may  secure adherents and dispute its claim. This would be even worse. It is  far harder to rally a multitude of conflicting rivals in the same camp,  than it is to take over a well-organized, homogeneous, and efficient  volunteer force, legalize its position, and raise it to the status of a  regular army. In any case, if no concerted action be taken, the question  will remain in a state of chaos, and the lack of official organization  brings a great risk of overlapping, dissension, and creation of rival  interests, and generally produces a state of affairs calculated to  postpone indefinitely the supply of the demand. Competition that neither  tends to keep down the price nor to improve the quality of the thing  produced is mere dissipation of energy.       [1]Esperanto itself is admirably organized (see p. 119) [Part II,     Chapter VII], and there are no factions or symptoms of dissension.     But Esperantists need official support and recognition.    In a word, the one thing needful at present is not a more highly  perfected language to adopt, but the adoption of the highly perfected  one we possess. By the admission of experts, no less than by the  practical experience of great numbers of persons in using it over a  number of years, it has been found adequate. Once found adequate, its  absolute utility merely depends upon universal adoption.    With utility in direct proportion to numbers of adherents, every recruit  augments its value--a thought which may well encourage waverers to make  the slight effort necessary to at any rate learn to read it.                                         II                      THE QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE--ECONOMIC                   ADVANTAGE OF AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE    As stated above, the question of principle will be treated here from  a purely economical point of view, since practical value, measured  by saving of time, money, and effort, must be the ultimate criterion  by which the success or failure of so far-reaching a reform as the  introduction of an international, auxiliary language will be decided.  The bearing of such a reform upon education, culture, race supremacy,  etc., is not without importance; but the discussion of these points must  be postponed as subsidiary.    Reduced to its simplest form, the economical argument is this:    (1) The volume of international intercourse is great and increasing.    (2) This intercourse is at present carried on in many different  languages of varying degrees of difficulty, but all relatively hard of  acquisition for those who do not know them as a mother-tongue. This is  uneconomical.    (3) It is economically sounder to carry on international intercourse in  one easy language than in a large number of hard ones.    (4) Therefore in principle an easy international language is desirable.    Let us glance at these four points a little more in detail.    No. 1 surely needs no demonstration. Every year there is more  communication between men of different race and language. And it is not  business, in the narrow sense of the term, that is exclusively or even  chiefly affected by diversity of language. Besides the enormous bulk  of pleasure travel, international congresses are growing in number and  importance; municipal fraternization is the latest fashion, and many  a worthy alderman, touring at the ratepayers' expense, must wish that  he had some German in Berlin, or a little Italian in Milan. Indeed, it  is at these points of international contact that language is a real  bar, actually preventing much intercourse that would otherwise have  taken place, rather than in business, which is organized in view of the  difficulty. Then there is the whole realm of scientific and learned  literature--work of which the accessibility to all concerned is of the  first importance, but is often hindered because a translation into one  language does not pay, or, if made, only reaches a limited public. Such  bars to freedom of interchange cannot be reckoned in money; but modern  economics recognizes the personal and social factor, and any obstacle to  research is certainly a public loss.    But important as are these various spheres of action, an even wider  international contact of thought and feeling is springing up in our  days. Democracy, science, and universal education are producing  everywhere similarity of institutions, of industry, of the whole  organization of life. Similarity of life will breed community of  interests, and from this arises real converse--more give and take in the  things that matter, less purely superficial dealings of the guide-book  or conversation-manual type.    (2) \"Business,\" meaning commerce, in so far as it is international,  may at present be carried on mainly in half a dozen of the principal  languages of Western Europe. Even so, their multiplicity is vexatious.  But outside the world of business other languages are entering the  field, and striving for equal rights. The tendency is all towards  self-assertion on the part of the nationalities that are beginning a  new era of national life and importance. The language difficulty in the  Austrian Empire reflects the growing self-consciousness of the Magyars.  Everywhere where young peoples are pushing their rights to take equal  rank among the nations of the world, the language question is put in  the forefront. The politicians of Ireland and Wales have realized the  importance of language in asserting nationality, but such engineered  language-agitation offers but a feeble reflex of the vitality of the  question in lands where the native language is as much in use for  all purposes as is English in England. These lands will fight harder  and harder against the claims to supremacy of a handful of Western  intruders. A famous foreign philologist,[1] in a report on the subject  presented to the Academy of Vienna, notes the increasing tendency of  Russian to take rank among the recognized languages for purposes of  polite learning. He is well placed to observe. With Russia knocking at  the door and Hungary waiting to storm the breach, what tongue may not  our descendants of the next century have to learn, under pain of losing  touch with important currents of thought? It is high time something  were done to standardize means of transmission. Owing to political  conditions, there are linguistically disintegrating forces at work,  which are at variance with the integrating forces of natural tendency.       [1]Prof. Shuchardt    From an economical point of view, a considerable amount of time, effort,  and money must be unreproductively invested in overcoming the \"language  difficulty.\" In money alone the amount must run into thousands of  pounds yearly. Among the unreproductive investments are--the employment  of foreign correspondence clerks, the time and money spent upon the  installation of educational plant for their production, the time and  money spent upon"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16751"],[0,"McGuffey's Sixth Eclectic Reader (#2)"],[1,"                       Charles Sumner.            148   31.
