Haben Sie was zu besorgen?«  Bringt ihm, was er haben muß:  Zeitung, Pfeife, Fidibus. --  Oder sollt' es wo im Rücken  Drücken, beißen oder zwicken,  Gleich ist man mit Freudigkeit  Dienstbeflissen und bereit. --  Oder sei's nach einer Prise,  Daß der Onkel heftig niese,  Ruft man: »Prosit!« allsogleich,  »Danke, wohl bekomm' es euch!« --  [»Danke,« - »wohl bekomm' es euch!« --]  Oder kommt er spät nach Haus,  Zieht man ihm die Stiefel aus,  Holt Pantoffel, Schlafrock, Mütze,  Daß er nicht im Kalten sitze, --  Kurz, man ist darauf bedacht,  Was dem Onkel Freude macht. --  -- Max und Moritz ihrerseits  Fanden darin keinen Reiz. --  -- Denkt euch nur, welch' schlechten Witz  Machten sie mit Onkel Fritz!

Some learned men say they took three years in getting  the materials, and were twenty-two years building the tower. It was  very great and high, but it was never finished. The people did  wickedly in building it, and God, who saw all they were doing,  confounded their language, so that one could not understand another.  Thus they left off building the tower, and that is why it is called  Babel. Then God scattered them abroad to re-people the earth.    [Illustration: BUILDING THE TOWER OF BABEL.]          LOT'S FLIGHT FROM SODOM.      In Palestine, the land in which Jesus dwelt when He was upon earth,  there is an inland sea, called the Dead Sea. Its waters are very salt,  and no trees grow upon its shores. Many long years before the birth of  Jesus Christ, two cities stood upon the plain which the waters of the  Dead Sea now cover. These cities were named Sodom and Gomorrah. Their  inhabitants were very wicked, so God destroyed their cities by raining  brimstone and fire upon them.    Before God destroyed these cities, He sent two angels to Lot,  Abraham's nephew, who dwelt in Sodom, commanding him to flee from it,  taking his family with him. The angels hastened him, saying, \"Arise,  take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be  consumed in the iniquity of the city.\" Then the angels took all four  by the hand and led them out, and said to Lot, \"Escape for thy life;  look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to  the mountain, lest thou be consumed.\"    Lot pleaded that he might take refuge in a little city, named Zoar,  not very far distant; and having obtained the angels' permission to do  so, he took his wife and daughters, and hastened away. In our picture  we see him and his daughters entering Zoar, and Sodom burning in the  distance--but what is that strange figure standing on the plain? Alas!  that is Lot's wife; the angel had commanded them that none were to  look back, but she did so, and was turned into a pillar of salt.    Lot did wrong in dwelling in such a wicked city as Sodom, and lost all  his property when he escaped for his life.    [Illustration: LOT ENTERING ZOAR.]          ABRAHAM AND ISAAC.      Abraham feared God and obeyed His commandments; and God promised to  bless Abraham very greatly. He gave him riches in cattle, and silver,  and gold; and said that the land of Canaan should belong to him and  his descendants. God also gave him a son in his old age, whom he  loved, very dearly and named Isaac. But God intended to try Abraham,  to see if he loved Him above all else.    One day God told Abraham to take his son Isaac, and to journey into  the land of Moriah; there to build an altar and offer Isaac as a  sacrifice upon it. It was a strange command, but Abraham knew that God  would not bid him do what was wrong, and believed that even if he slew  his son, God was able to raise him to life again. So he rose early in  the morning, saddled his ass, took two of his young men, and wood for  the fire; and then, accompanied by Isaac, started on his journey. On  the third day they came near the place God had pointed out, and  Abraham left the young men with the ass, while he and his son  journeyed up the mountain alone. As they went along, Isaac--who  carried the wood, while his father carried the knife and the fire,  said: \"My father.\" And Abraham replied, \"Here am I, my son.\" Then  Isaac said: \"Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a  burnt offering?\" Abraham answered: \"My son, God will provide Himself a  lamb for a burnt offering.\"    The altar was built, Isaac was bound and laid upon it, and Abraham's  arm was uplifted to strike the blow that was to take his son's life  away. Then God called to Abraham, \"Lay not thine hand upon the lad,  neither do thou anything unto him; for now I know that thou fearest  God, seeing that thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from  Me.\" Abraham looked up, and behind him saw a ram which was caught in a  thicket by its horns; this he took and offered as a sacrifice to God.    So God tried Abraham; and also Himself provided the lamb for the burnt  offering, as Abraham had said.    [Illustration: ABRAHAM AND ISAAC.]          THE STORY OF REBEKAH.      When Abraham had grown old, he desired that his son, Isaac, should  take a wife. But he did not wish him to choose one from among the  women of Canaan, for they worshipped idols. So he called his oldest  servant, and commanded him to make a journey to Abraham's own country,  and there to choose a wife for Isaac. Then the man took ten camels,  together with food and other goods for the journey, and set out for  the city of Nahor. When he came to the walls of the city he spied a  well, and, as it was evening, the young women were coming out to draw  water. Then he asked God to help him to choose a wife for Isaac,  saying, \"Let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,  'Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink,' and who shall  reply, 'Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also;' let her be the  one Thou hast chosen for Thy servant Isaac.\"    [Illustration: REBEKAH GIVING DRINK TO ABRAHAM'S SERVANT.]    Before he had done speaking, there came out a beautiful young woman,  whose name was Rebekah. She was the grand-daughter of Nahor, Abraham's  brother. She carried a pitcher upon her shoulder, and went down to the  well and filled it. Then Abraham's servant ran to her and asked her  for a drink from her pitcher. She said, \"Drink, my lord,\" and held the  pitcher for him, and afterwards drew water for his camels also. Then  he took a golden jewel and a pair of gold bracelets, and put them upon  her, and asked whose daughter she was, and if her father could lodge  him and his company. When she told him who she was, he was glad, and  worshipped God, for he was sure then that he had been led to the house  of Abraham's brother.    Then Rebekah called out her friends, and they took the man in to lodge  him for the night, and set food before him. But he would not eat until  he had told them his errand, and how he believed God had chosen  Rebekah for Isaac's wife. He then asked the parents to say whether  they would give their daughter or not, but they said: \"It has been  ordered by God; we cannot give or refuse her. Rebekah is before you.  Take her and go. Let her be Isaac's wife, as the Lord hath spoken.\"    When the man heard these words, he again praised God, and then he  brought out rich clothing, and jewels of gold and silver, and gave  them to Rebekah. He also gave presents to her mother and brother. When  they asked Rebekah if she would go with the man, she said \"Yes,\" and  took leave of her friends, who blessed her. Then, with her nurse and  her maids, she rode upon the camels, and followed the man, for she  believed that so God had ordered it.    Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi, and one evening he walked into the  fields to meditate. As he lifted up his eyes he saw the company of  camels coming towards him. At the same time, Rebekah lifted up her  eyes and saw Isaac. When the man told her it was his master Isaac, she  alighted from the camel, and covered her face with a veil, according  to the custom of the East. When the man told Isaac all he had done,  Isaac was pleased, and welcomed Rebekah, and gave her the tent that  had been his mother's. And she became his wife.    [Illustration: REBEKAH JOURNEYING TO ISAAC.]           *       *       *       *       *          JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN.      How wonderful is the way in which God works for those who fear Him!  The history of Joseph teaches us this truth.    Joseph had one younger and ten elder brothers. The name of the younger  brother was Benjamin. Jacob was the father of them all; and Rachel was  the mother of Joseph and Benjamin. Jacob loved Joseph more than all  his other sons, and made him a coat of many colours; but his elder  brothers hated him, and one day, when far away from home, proposed to  kill him. They cast him into a pit instead, and afterwards sold him as  a slave to some merchants who were travelling from Gilead to Egypt.  When they returned to their father, they took Joseph's coat of many  colours, which they had dipped in blood, and brought it to Jacob,  saying: \"This have we found: know now if it be thy son's coat or no.\"  Jacob knew the coat; and thought Joseph had been killed by some wild  beast, and mourned for him greatly.    [Illustration: THE MEETING OF ISAAC AND REBEKAH.]    The merchants carried Joseph into Egypt, and sold him to one of the  king's officers, named Potiphar. But, though a slave, he was not  forsaken by God. No, God was with him, and made all that he did to  prosper. His master placed him over all his house, but his mistress  wanted him to commit a great sin. When he refused, she accused him  unjustly to his master, and Potiphar had him cast into prison.    God was with Joseph in the prison, and gave him such favour with the  keeper that he set him over all the other prisoners. Among them were  two; one who had been the king's butler, and the other his baker. Both  had dreams which troubled them much, but Joseph was enabled by God to  interpret their dreams for them. By-and-by Pharaoh, the king, dreamed  a dream. He was standing on the banks of a river, and saw seven fat  cows come up out of the water and feed in a meadow; afterwards seven  very lean cows came up and devoured the fat ones. Then Pharaoh awoke;  but he dreamed again, and saw that seven very poor ears of corn  devoured seven that were full and good. In the morning he was greatly  troubled. What could the dreams mean? He called for the magicians and  the wise men, but they could not tell. At last it was told him how  Joseph had interpreted the dreams in the prison; so he sent for  Joseph, who came from the prison, and stood before the king.    Pharaoh said, \"I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can  interpret it; and I have heard say of"]]]
