[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17461"],[0,"The Great German Composers (#2)"],[1,"tells us that no one has been his equal, with  the possible exception of Handel. He was also an able performer on  various stringed instruments, and his preference for the clavichord *  led him to write a method for that instrument, which has been the basis  of all succeeding methods for the piano. Bach's teachings and influence  may be said to have educated a large number of excellent composers and  organ and piano players, among whom were Emanuel Bach, Cramer, Hummel,  and Clementi; and on his school of theory and practice the best results  in music have been built.         * An old instrument which may be called the nearest       prototype of the modern square piano.    That Bach's glory as a composer should be largely posthumous is probably  the result of his exceeding simplicity and diffidence, for he always  shrank from popular applause; therefore we may believe his compositions  were not placed in the proper light during his life. It was through  Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven, that the musical world learned what a  master-spirit had wrought in the person of John Sebastian Bach. The  first time Mozart heard one of Bach's hymns, he said, \"Thank God! I  learn something absolutely new.\" Bach's great compositions include his  \"Preludes and Fugues\" for the organ, works so difficult and elaborate  as perhaps to be above the average comprehension, but sources of delight  and instruction to all musicians; the \"Matthaeus Passion,\" for two  choruses and two orchestras, one of the masterpieces in music, which was  not produced till a century after it was written; the \"Oratorio of the  Nativity of Jesus Christ;\" and a very large number of masses, anthems,  cantatas, chorals, hymns, etc. These works, from their largeness and  dignity of form, as also from their depth of musical science, have been  to all succeeding composers an art-armory, whence they have derived  and furbished their brightest weapons. In the study of Bach's works the  student finds the deepest and highest reaches in the science of music;  for his mind seems to have grasped all its resources, and to have  embodied them with austere purity and precision of form. As Spenser  is called the poet for poets, and Laplace the mathematician for  mathematicians, so Bach is the musician for musicians. While Handel may  be considered a purely independent and parallel growth, it is not too  much to assert that without Sebastian Bach and his matchless studies  for the piano, organ, and orchestra, we could not have had the varied  musical development in sonata and symphony from such masters as  Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. Three of Sebastian Bach's sons became  distinguished musicians, and to Emanuel we owe the artistic development  of the sonata, which in its turn became the foundation of the symphony.          HANDEL.      I.    To the modern Englishman Handel is almost a contemporary. Paintings and  busts of this great minstrel are scattered everywhere throughout the  land. He lies in Westminster Abbey among the great poets, warriors, and  statesmen, a giant memory in his noble art. A few hours after death  the sculptor Roubiliac took a cast of his face, which he wrought into  imperishable marble; \"moulded in colossal calm,\" he towers above his  tomb, and accepts the homage of the world benignly like a god. Exeter  Hall and the Foundling Hospital in London are also adorned with marble  statues of him.    There are more than fifty known pictures of Handel, some of them by  distinguished artists. In the best of these pictures Handel is seated in  the gay costume of the period, with sword, shot-silk breeches, and coat  embroidered with gold. The face is noble in its repose. Benevolence  is seated about the finely-shaped mouth, and the face wears the  mellow dignity of years, without weakness or austerity. There are few  collectors of prints in England and America who have not a woodcut or  a lithograph of him. His face and his music are alike familiar to the  English-speaking world.    Handel came to England in the year 1710, at the age of twenty-five. Four  years before he had met, at Naples, Scarlatti, Porpora, and Corelli.  That year had been the turning-point in his life. With one stride he  reached the front rank, and felt that no musician alive could teach him  anything.    George Frederick Handel (or Handel, as the name is written in German)  was born at Halle, Lower Saxony, in the year 1685. Like German  literature, German music is a comparatively recent growth. What little  feeling existed for the musical art employed itself in cultivating the  alien flowers of Italian song. Even eighty years after this Mozart and  Haydn were treated like lackeys and vagabonds, just as great actors were  treated in England at the same period. Handel's father looked on music  as an occupation having very little dignity.    Determined that his young son should become a doctor like himself, and  leave the divine art to Italian fiddlers and French buffoons, he did not  allow him to go to a public school even, for fear he should learn the  gamut. But the boy Handel, passionately fond of sweet sounds, had, with  the connivance of his nurse, hidden in the garret a poor spinet, and in  stolen hours taught himself how to play. At last the senior Handel had  a visit to make to another son in the service of the Duke of  Saxe-Weissenfels, and the young George was taken along to the ducal  palace. The boy strayed into the chapel, and was irresistibly drawn to  the organ. His stolen performance was made known to his father and the  duke, and the former was very much enraged at such a direct evidence of  disobedience. The duke, however, being astonished at the performance of  the youthful genius, interceded for him, and recommended that his taste  should be encouraged and cultivated instead of repressed.    From this time forward fortune showered upon him a combination of  conditions highly favorable to rapid development. Severe training,  ardent friendship, the society of the first composers, and incessant  practice were vouchsafed him. As the pupil of the great organist Zachau,  he studied the whole existing mass of German and Italian music, and soon  exacted from his master the admission that he had nothing more to teach  him. Thence he went to Berlin to study the opera-school, where Ariosti  and Bononcini were favorite composers. The first was friendly, but the  latter, who with a first-rate head had a cankered heart, determined  to take the conceit out of the Saxon boy. He challenged him to play at  sight an elaborate piece. Handel played it with perfect precision, and  thenceforward Bononcini, though he hated the youth as a rival, treated  him as an equal.    On the death of his father Handel secured an engagement at the Hamburg  opera-house, where he soon made his mark by the ability with which, on  several occasions, he conducted rehearsals.    At the age of nineteen Handel received the offer of the Luebeck organ, on  condition that he would marry the daughter of the retiring organist. He  went down with his friend Mattheson, who it seems had been offered  the same terms. They both returned, however, in single blessedness to  Hamburg.    Though the Luebeck maiden had stirred no bad blood between them, musical  rivalry did. A dispute in the theatre resulted in a duel. The only thing  that saved. Handel's life was a great brass button that shivered his  antagonist's point, when they were parted to become firm friends again.    While at Hamburg Handel's first two operas were composed, \"Almira\" and  \"Nero.\" Both of these were founded on dark tales of crime and sorrow,  and, in spite of some beautiful airs and clever instrumentation, were  musical failures, as might be expected.    Handel had had enough of manufacturing operas in Germany, and so in  July, 1706, he went to Florence. Here he was cordially received; for  Florence was second to no city in Italy in its passion for encouraging  the arts. Its noble specimens of art creations in architecture,  painting, and sculpture, produced a powerful impression upon the young  musician. In little more than a week's time he composed an opera,  \"Rodrigo,\" for which he obtained one hundred sequins. His next visit  was to Venice, where he arrived at the height of the carnival. Whatever  effect Venice, with its weird and mysterious beauty, with its marble  palaces, facades, pillars, and domes, its magnificent shrines and  frescoes, produced on Handel, he took Venice by storm. Handel's power as  an organist and a harpsichord player was only second to his strength as  a composer, even when, in the full zenith of his maturity, he composed  the \"Messiah\" and \"Judas Maccabaeus.\"    \"Il caro Sassone,\" the dear Saxon, found a formidable opponent as well  as dear friend in the person of Scarlatti. One night at a masked ball,  given by a nobleman, Handel was present in disguise. He sat at the  harpsichord, and astonished the company with his playing; but no one  could tell who it was that ravished the ears of the assembly. Presently  another masquerader came into the room, walked up to the instrument, and  called out: \"It is either the devil or the Saxon!\" This was Scarlatti,  who afterward had with Handel, in Florence and Rome, friendly contests  of skill, in which it seemed difficult to decide which was victor. To  satisfy the Venetian public, Handel composed the opera \"Agrippina,\"  which made a _furore_ among all the connoisseurs of the city.    So, having seen the summer in Florence and the carnival in Venice, he  must hurry on to be in time for the great Easter celebrations in Rome.  Here he lived under the patronage of Cardinal Otto-boni, one of the  wealthiest and most liberal of the Sacred College. The cardinal was  a modern representative of the ancient patrician. Living himself in  princely luxury, he endowed hospitals and surgeries for the public.

THE CONDUCTOR'S SCORE.                       _Page 325_    INDEX                                                       _Page 351_          How to Listen to Music          I    _Introduction_      [Sidenote: _The book's appeal._]    This book has a purpose, which is as simple as it is plain; and an  unpretentious scope. It does not aim to edify either the musical  professor or the musical scholar. It comes into the presence of the  musical student with all becoming modesty. Its business is with those  who love music and present themselves for its gracious ministrations  in Concert-Room and Opera House, but have not studied it as professors  and scholars are supposed to study. It is not for the careless unless  they be willing to inquire whether it might not be well to yield the  common conception of entertainment in favor of the higher enjoyment  which springs from serious contemplation of beautiful things; but if  they are willing so to inquire, they shall be accounted the class  that the author is most anxious to reach. The reasons which prompted  its writing and the laying out of its plan will presently appear. For  the frankness of his disclosure the author might be willing to  apologize were his reverence for music less and his consideration for  popular affectations more; but because he is convinced that a love for  music carries with it that which, so it be but awakened, shall  speedily grow into an honest desire to know more about the beloved  object, he is willing to seem unamiable to the amateur while arguing  the need of even so mild a stimulant as his book, and ingenuous,  mayhap even childish, to the professional musician while trying to  point a way in which better appreciation may be sought.    [Sidenote: _Talent in listening._]    The capacity properly to listen to music is better proof of musical  talent in the listener than skill to play upon an instrument or  ability to sing acceptably when unaccompanied by that capacity. It  makes more for that gentleness and refinement of emotion, thought, and  action which, in the highest sense of the term, it is the province of  music to promote. And it is a much rarer accomplishment. I cannot  conceive anything more pitiful than the spectacle of men and women  perched on a fair observation point exclaiming rapturously at the  loveliness of mead and valley, their eyes melting involuntarily in  tenderness at the sight of moss-carpeted slopes and rocks and peaceful  wood, or dilating in reverent wonder at mountain magnificence, and  then learning from their exclamations that, as a matter of fact, they  are unable to distinguish between rock and tree, field and forest,  earth and sky; between the dark-browns of the storm-scarred rock, the  greens of the foliage, and the blues of the sky.    [Sidenote: _Ill equipped listeners._]    Yet in the realm of another sense, in the contemplation of beauties  more ethereal and evanescent than those of nature, such is the  experience which in my capacity as a writer for newspapers I have made  for many years. A party of people blind to form and color cannot be  said to be well equipped for a Swiss journey, though loaded down with  alpenstocks and Baedekers; yet the spectacle of such a party on the  top of the Rigi is no more pitiful and anomalous than that presented  by the majority of the hearers in our concert-rooms. They are there to  adventure a journey into a realm whose beauties do not disclose  themselves to the senses alone, but whose perception requires a  co-operation of all the finer faculties; yet of this they seem to know  nothing, and even of that sense to which the first appeal is made it  may be said with profound truth that \"hearing they hear not, neither  do they understand.\"    [Sidenote: _Popular ignorance of music._]    Of all the arts, music is practised most and thought about least. Why  this should be the case may be explained on several grounds. A sweet  mystery enshrouds the nature of music. Its material part is subtle and  elusive. To master it on its technical side alone costs a vast  expenditure of time, patience, and industry. But since it is, in one  manifestation or another, the most popular of the arts, and one the  enjoyment of which is conditioned in a peculiar degree on love, it  remains passing strange that the indifference touching its nature and  elements, and the character of the phenomena which produce it, or are  produced by it, is so general. I do not recall that anybody has ever  tried to ground this popular ignorance touching an art of which, by  right of birth, everybody is a critic. The unamiable nature of the  task, of which I am keenly conscious, has probably been a bar to such  an undertaking. But a frank diagnosis must precede the discovery of a  cure for every disease, and I have undertaken to point out a way in  which this grievous ailment in the social body may at least be  lessened.    [Sidenote: _Paucity of intelligent comment._]    [Sidenote: _Want of a model._]    It is not an exaggeration to say that one might listen for a lifetime  to the polite conversation of our drawing-rooms (and I do not mean by  this to refer to the United States alone) without hearing a symphony  talked about in terms indicative of more than the most superficial  knowledge of the outward form, that is, the dimensions and apparatus,  of such a composition. No other art provides an exact analogy for this  phenomenon. Everybody can say something containing a degree of  appositeness about a poem, novel, painting, statue, or building. If he  can do no more he can go as far as Landseer's rural critic who  objected to one of the artist's paintings on the ground that not one  of the three pigs eating from a trough had a foot in it. It is the  absence of the standard of judgment employed in this criticism which  makes significant talk about music so difficult. Nature failed to  provide a model for this ethereal art. There is nothing in the natural  world with which the simple man may compare it.    [Sidenote: _Simple terms confounded._]    It is not alone a knowledge of the constituent factors of a symphony,  or the difference between a sonata and a suite, a march and a mazurka,  that is rare. Unless you chance to be listening to the conversation of  musicians (in which term I wish to include amateurs who are what the  word amateur implies, and whose knowledge stands in some respectable  relation to their love), you will find, so frequently that I have not  the heart to attempt an estimate of the proportion, that the most  common words in the terminology of the art are misapplied. Such  familiar things as harmony and melody, time and tune, are continually  confounded. Let us call a distinguished witness into the box; the  instance is not new, but it will serve. What does Tennyson mean when  he says:        \"All night have the roses heard        The flute, violin, bassoon;      All night has the casement jessamine stirr'd        To the dancers dancing in tune?\"    [Sidenote: _Tune and time._]    Unless the dancers who wearied Maud were provided with even a more  extraordinary instrumental outfit than the Old Lady of Banbury Cross,  how could they have danced \"in tune?\"    [Sidenote: _Blunders of poets and essayists._]    Musical study of a sort being almost as general as study of the \"three  Rs,\" it must be said that the gross forms of ignorance are utterly  inexcusable. But "]]]
