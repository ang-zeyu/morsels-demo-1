Organisms are, indeed,  contrived for use, but according to a preordained plan of structure,  which must not be violated.\" It is of little moment whether this  explanation be considered satisfactory or not. It would certainly be  irrational to refuse to believe that the eye was made for the purpose of  vision, because we cannot tell why a man has mammae. A man might as well  refuse to admit that there is any meaning in all the writings of Plato,  because there is a sentence in them which he cannot understand.      _The Pantheistic Theory_.    This has been one of the most widely diffused and persistent forms of  human thought on this whole subject. It has been for thousands of years  not only the philosophy, but the religion of India, and, to a great  extent, of China. It underlies all the forms of Greek philosophy. It  crept into the Church, concealed under the disguise of Scriptural  terminology, in the form of Neo-Platonism. It was constantly reappearing  during the Middle Ages, sometimes in a philosophical, and sometimes a  mystical form. It was revived by Spinoza in the seventeenth century, and  subsequently became dominant in the philosophy and literature of Europe.  It is coming up again. Some distinguished naturalists are swinging round  from one pole to the opposite; from saying there is no God, to teaching  that everything is God. Sometimes, one and the same book in one half  teaches materialism, in the other half idealism: the one affirming that  everything is matter, the other that matter is nothing, but that  everything is mind, and mind is God.    The leading principles of the Pantheistic theory are,--(1.) That there  is an Infinite and Absolute Being. Of this Being nothing can be affirmed  but actuality. It is denied that it is conscious, intelligent, or  voluntary. (2.) It is subject to the blind necessity of self-evolution  or development. (3.) This development being necessary is constant; from  everlasting to everlasting. According to the Braminical doctrine,  indeed, there are successive cycles of activity and repose, each cycle  being measured by countless milliards of centuries. According to the  moderns, self-evolution being necessary, there can be no repose, so that  Ohne Welt kein Gott. (4.) The Finite is, therefore, the existence form  of the Infinite; all that is in the latter for the time being is in the  former. All that is possible is actual. (5.) The Finite is the Infinite,  or, to use theistic language, the World is God, in the sense that all  the world is and contains is the form in which God, at each successive  moment, exists. There is no power, save only the power manifested in  the world; no consciousness, intelligence, or voluntary activity, but in  finite things, and the aggregate of these is the power, consciousness,  intelligence, and activity of God. What we call sin is as much a form of  God's activity as what we call virtue. In other words, there is no such  thing as free agency in man, no such thing as sin or responsibility.  When a man dies he sinks into the abyss of being as a drop of water is  lost in the ocean. (6.) Man is the highest form of God's existence. God  is incarnate in the human race. Strauss says, that what the Church  teaches of Christ is not true of any individual man, but is true of  mankind. Or, as Feuerbach more concisely expresses it, \"Man alone is our  God.\" The blasphemy of some of the German philosophers on this subject  is simply unutterable. In India we see the practical operation of this  system when it takes hold on the people. There the personification of  the Infinite as evil (the Goddess Kala) is the most popular object of  worship.      _Epicurean Theory._    Epicurus assumed the existence of matter, force and motion,--Stoff und  Kraft. He held that all space was filled with molecules of matter in a  state of rapid motion in every direction. These molecules were subject  to gravity and endowed with properties or forces. One combination of  molecules gave rise to unorganized matter, another to life, another to  mind; and from the various combinations, guided by unintelligent  physical laws, all the wonderful organisms of plants and animals have  arisen. To these combinations also all the phenomena of life, instinct,  and intelligence in the world are to be referred. This theory has been  adopted in our day by a large class of scientific men, especially in  Germany. The modern advocates of the theory are immeasurably superior to  the ancient Epicureans in their knowledge of astronomy, botany, zooelogy,  and biology; but in their theory of the universe, and in their mode of  accounting for all the phenomena of life and intelligence, they are  precisely on the same level. They have not added an idea to the system,  which has ever been regarded as the opprobrium of human thought.  Buechner, Moleschott, Vogt, hold that matter is eternal and  indestructible; that matter and force are inseparable: the one cannot  exist without the other. What, it is asked, is motion without something  moving? What is electricity without an electrified body? What is  attraction without molecules attracting each other? What is  contractibility without muscular fibre, or secretion without a secreting  gland? One combination of molecules exhibits the phenomena of life,  another combination exhibits the phenomena of mind. All this was taught  by the old heathen philosopher more than two thousand years ago. That  this system denies the existence of God, of mind as a thinking substance  distinct from matter, and of the possibility of the conscious existence  of man after death, are not inferences drawn by opponents, but  conclusions openly avowed by its advocates.      _Herbert Spencer's New Philosophy._    Mr. Darwin calls Spencer our \"great philosopher.\" His is the speculating  mind of the new school of science. This gives to his opinions special  interest, although no one but himself is to be held responsible for his  peculiar views, except so far as others see fit to avow them. Mr.  Spencer postulates neither mind nor matter. He begins with Force. Force,  however, is itself perfectly inscrutable. All we know about it is, that  it is, that it is indestructible, and that it is persistent.    As to the origin of the universe, he says there are three possible  suppositions: 1st. That it is self-existent. 2d. That it is  self-created. 3d. That it is created by an external agency.[3] All these  he examines and rejects. The first is equivalent to Atheism, by which  Spencer understands the doctrine which makes Space, Matter, and Force  eternal and the causes of all phenomena. This, he says, assumes the idea  of self-existence, which is unthinkable. The second theory he makes  equivalent to Pantheism. \"The precipitation of vapor,\" he says, \"into  cloud, aids us in forming a symbolic conception of a self-evolved  universe;\" but, he adds, \"really to conceive self-creation, is to  conceive potential existence passing into actual existence by some  inherent necessity, which we cannot do.\" (p. 32). The Theistic theory,  he says, is equally untenable. \"Whoever agrees that the atheistic  hypothesis is untenable because it involves the impossible idea of  self-existence, must perforce admit that the theistic hypothesis is  untenable if it contains the same impossible idea.\" (p. 38). The origin  of the universe is, therefore, a fact which cannot be explained. It must  have had a cause; and all we know is that its cause is unknowable and  inscrutable.    When we turn to nature the result is the same. Everything is  inscrutable. All we know is that there are certain appearances, and that  where there is appearance there must be something that appears. But what  that something is, what is the noumenon which underlies the phenomenon,  it is impossible for us to know. In nature we find two orders of  phenomena, or appearances; the one objective or external, the other  subjective in our consciousness. There are an Ego and a non-Ego, a  subject and object. These are not identical. \"It is,\" he says,  \"rigorously impossible to conceive that our knowledge is a knowledge of  appearances only, without at the same time conceiving a reality of which  they are appearances, for appearance without reality is unthinkable.\"  (p. 88). So far we can go. There is a reality which is the cause of  phenomena. Further than that, in that direction, our ignorance is  profound. He proves that space cannot be an entity, an attribute, or a  category of thought, or a nonentity. The same is true of time, of  motion, of matter, of electricity, light, magnetism, etc., etc. They all  resolve themselves into appearances produced by an unknown cause.    As the question, What is matter? is a crucial one, he dwells upon it in  various parts of his writings. Newton's theory of ultimate atoms;  Leibnitz's doctrine of monads; and the dynamic theory of Boscovich,  which makes matter mere centres of force, are all dismissed as  unthinkable. It is not very clear in what sense that word is to be  taken. Sometimes it seems to mean, meaningless; at others,  self-contradictory or absurd; at others, inconceivable, _i. e._ that of  which no conception or mental image can be formed; at any rate, it  implies what is unknowable and untenable. The result is, so far as  matter is concerned, that we know nothing about it. \"Our conception of  matter,\" he says, \"reduced to its simplest shape, is that of coexistent  positions that offer resistance, as contrasted with our conception of  space in which the coexistent positions offer no resistance.\" (p. 166).  Resistance, however, is a form of force; and, therefore, on the  following"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19200"],[0,"The History of a Lie: \"The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion\" (#2)"],[1,"sinuating, accusing, pointing their  fingers at \"the source of all evil\"--at the Jews who constitute but a  fraction of one per cent of the world's population, and who are in  Europe to-day, after the close of the World War, more wretched and  miserable than ever before,--persecuted, hounded and starved.    What are these mysterious Protocols? How did they come to \"the Russian  mystic\" who revealed them in 1905, and which have now been exhumed from  obscurity for the purpose of enlightening the world, and which point to  the Jews as the cause of all unrest, chaos and confusion?    Nilus, \"the Russian mystic,\" is credited with several versions of how he  had secured the Protocols, and his stories flatly contradict one  another. In 1905 he said that the Protocols were given to him by a  prominent Russian conservative whose name he did not mention, and who in  turn had received them from an unnamed woman who had stolen them from  \"one of the most influential leaders of Freemasonry at the close of a  secret meeting of the initiated in France.\" Then, several years later,  Nilus wrote that his friend himself had stolen the Protocols from \"the  headquarters of the Society of Zion in France.\" Several years  afterwards, in a new edition of his book, Nilus said that the  \"Protocols\" came from Switzerland and not from France. This time he  named his Russian conservative friend, Sukhotin, who had died in the  meantime. He added that the Protocols were not Jewish-Masonic but  Zionist documents secretly read at the Zionist Congress in Basle in  1897.    Then followed a new edition of the Nilus book bearing the date of 1917.  A translation of this edition has recently appeared in this country,  containing a brand-new explanation as to how the Protocols were rescued  and given to the world. This explanation is taken from the German  version published in Charlottenburg. The introduction to that edition  says that the Protocols, having been read from day to day at the Basle  Congress, were sent as read to Frankfort on the Main. The disclosure of  them came through the infidelity of the messenger.    The 1917 edition is published with a prologue and an epilogue, like a  drama, which indeed it is, with all the ingredients of melodrama--a  villain, a mysterious woman, a Grand Duke, a conspiracy to destroy the  world, and a saint--Nilus, who convicts himself in his own writings of  falsification in the giving of these various accounts of how the  Protocols came into his possession.    Nothing is known of Sergius Nilus. Russian standard reference books and  encyclopedias contain no mention of his name.    The anonymous American editor of the Nilus book gives the following  information about Nilus:    \"Serge Nilus, in the 1905 edition of whose book was first published the  _Zionist Protocols_, was, as he states, born in the year 1862, of  Russian parents holding liberal opinions. His family was fairly well  known in Moscow, for its members were educated people who were firm in  their allegiance to the Tsar and the Greek Church. On one side he is  said to have been connected by marriage with the nobility of the Baltic  provinces. Nilus himself was graduated from the University of Moscow and  early entered the civil service, obtaining a small appointment in the  law courts. Later, he received a post under the Procurator of a  provincial court in the Caucasus. Finally, tiring of the law, he went to  the Government of Orel, where he was a landowner and a noble. His  spiritual life had been tumultuous and full of trouble, and finally he  entered the Troitsky-Sergevsky Monastery near Moscow. 'In answer to his  appeal for pardon, Saint Sergei, stern and angry, appeared to him twice  in a vision. He left the Monastery a converted man.'    \"From 1905 until the present, little is known of his activities.  Articles are said to have appeared from time to time in the Russian  press from his pen. A returning traveller from Siberia in August, 1919,  was positive in his statement that Nilus was in Irkutsk in June of that  year. Whether his final fate was that of Admiral Kolchak is not known.\"    The American editor of Sergius Nilus's book containing the \"Protocols\"  is hiding behind anonymity. The name of the traveller from Siberia who  was so positive in his statement that Nilus was in Irkutsk is also  concealed. And Serge Nilus to whom Saint Sergei \"appeared twice in a  vision\" \"is said to have written articles in the Russian press\" of which  nobody has knowledge.    In Germany, Nilus is described as follows:    \"Sergius Nilus was an employee of the Russian secret police department,  of the _okhrana_, connected with the Church, especially relating to  'foreign religions.' He lived for some time at the Optina Pustina  monastery. In 1901 he published a book entitled 'The Great in the Small  and the Anti-Christ.' According to the Lutsch Sveta, Nilus claims to  have received in 1901 a copy of the text of the Protocols from the  secret archives of the Main Zionist organization in France, but he  published the 'protocols' only in 1905. A second edition appeared in  1911, and finally another edition was brought out in the beginning of  1917, but all copies are said to have been destroyed.\"    \"The Cause of the World Unrest,\" an anonymous book published in England  and reprinted in this country, speaks of Nilus and the \"Protocols\" as  follows:    \"In the year 1903 a Russian, Serge Nilus, published a book entitled _The  Great in Little_. The second edition, which was published at Tsarskoye  Selo in 1905, had an additional chapter, the twelfth, under the heading  'Anti-Christ as a Near Political Possibility.' This chapter consisted of  some twenty pages of introduction followed by the text of twenty-four  'Protocols of Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion,' and the book ends  with some twenty pages of commentaries on these protocols by Nilus.    \"Directly after the protocols, comes a statement by Nilus that they are  'signed by representatives of Zion of the thirty-third degree.' These  protocols were secretly extracted or were stolen from a whole volume of  protocols. All this was got by my correspondent out of the secret  depositories of the Head Chancellery of Zion. This Chancellery is at  present on French territory.\"    In the edition of 1917 Sergius Nilus wrote:         \"My book has already reached the fourth edition, but it is only       definitely known to me now and in a manner worthy of belief, and       that through Jewish sources, that these protocols are nothing other       than the strategic plans for the conquest of the world under the       heel of Israel, and worked out by the leaders of the Jewish       people--and read by the 'Prince of Exile,' Theodor Herzl, during the       first Zionist Congress, summoned by him in August, 1897, in Basle.\"    It will be shown later that the so-called Butmi edition of the  \"protocols\" published in 1907 contains the definite statement of the man  who claims to have translated them into Russian from the French in 1901  that the Elders of Zion mentioned in the Protocols are not to be  confounded with the Zionist movement.    In the 1917 edition Sergius Nilus wrote:         \"In 1901 I came into possession of a manuscript, and this       comparatively small book was destined to cause a deep change in my       entire viewpoint as can only be caused in the heart of man by       Divine Power. It was comparable with the miracle of making the       blind see. 'May Divine acts show on him.'         \"This manuscript was called 'the protocols of the Zionist Men of       Wisdom,' and it was given to me by the now deceased leader of the       Tchernigov nobility, who later became vice-governor of Stavropol,       Alexis Nikolayevitch Sukhotin. I had already begun to work with my       pen for the glory of the Lord, and I was friendly with Sukhotin.       _He was a man of my opinion_, that is, extremely conservative, as       they are now termed.         \"Sukhotin told me that he in turn had obtained the manuscript from       a lady who always lived abroad. This lady was a noblewoman from       Tchernigov. He mentioned her by name, but I have forgotten it. He       said that she obtained it in some mysterious way, by theft, I       believe.         \"Sukhotin also said that one copy of the manuscript was given by       this lady to Sipiagin, the Minister of the Interior, upon her       return from abroad, and that Sipiagin was subsequently killed. He       said other things of the same mysterious character. But when I       first became acquainted with the contents of the manuscript I was       convinced that its terrible, cruel and straight-forward truth is       witness of its true origin from the 'Zionist Men of Wisdom,' and       that no other evidence of its origin would be needed.\"    Feodor Roditchev, one of Russia's most famous liberals, a member of the  nobility, a former member of the Duma, writing recently of the Nilus  protocols and of Sukhotin whom Nilus described as a man of his own  opinion, says:         \"For months I hear on all sides about the Nilus book and its       success in England, and I am asked, Who is Nilus? There was a       Nilus, an associate justice of the Moscow District Court. It is       said that the manuscript was given to Nilus by Sukhotin, the       notorious zemstvo official of Chernsk.         \"The Berlin edition contains no mention of Sukhotin, but in that       edition Nilus said, 'Pray for the soul of the boyar Alexis.'         \"The name of the notorious Alexey Nikolayevitch Sukhotin means       nothing to the present generation. But there was a time when his       name attracted attention.         \"Sukhotin arrested the peasants of a whole village for refusing to       cart manure from his stables because the animals there were       infected with glanders. Judge Tsurikov released the peasants.       Tsurikov was removed for this, while Sukhotin justified his act by"]]]
