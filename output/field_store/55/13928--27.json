[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18637"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation (#2)"],[1," that a very much larger volume was the result.    After another decade, in the course of which many of the earlier  interpretations were reviewed and modified, the Senate again moved for a  revision of the Annotations. Senate Joint Resolution 69 introduced by  the then Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Alexander Wiley,  again called upon the Library of Congress to undertake the work. The  confidence thus implied was most thoroughly appreciated. To meet his  responsibilities, the Librarian called upon Dr. Edward S. Corwin to head  the project. The collaborating staff, supplied by the Legislative  Reference Service, included Dr. Norman J. Small as assistant editor,  Miss Mary Louise Ramsey, and Robert J. Harris.    This time, more than ever, the compilers faced a difficult task in  balancing the prime requirement of a thorough and adequate annotation  against the very practical desire to keep the results within convenient  compass.    Work on the project was delayed until funds were made available. In  consequence the annotations have been extended to a somewhat later date,  covering decisions of the Supreme Court through June 30, 1952.    Ernest S. Griffith,  _Director, Legislative Reference Service._          EDITOR'S FOREWORD      The purpose of this volume is twofold; first, to set forth so far as  feasible the currently operative meaning of all provisions of the  Constitution of the United States; second, to trace in the case of the  most important provisions the course of decision and practice whereby  their meaning was arrived at by the Constitution's official  interpreters. Naturally, the most important source of material relied  upon comprises relevant decisions of the Supreme Court; but acts of  Congress and Executive orders and regulations have also been frequently  put under requisition. Likewise, proceedings of the Convention which  framed the Constitution have been drawn upon at times, as have the views  of dissenting Justices and occasionally of writers, when it was thought  that they would aid understanding.    That the Constitution has possessed capacity for growth in notable  measure is evidenced by the simple fact of its survival and daily  functioning in an environment so vastly different from that in which it  was ordained and established by the American people. Nor has this  capacity resided to any great extent in the provision which the  Constitution makes for its own amendment. Far more has it resided in the  power of judicial review exercised by the Supreme Court, the product of  which, and hence the record of the Court's achievement in adapting the  Constitution to changing conditions, is our national Constitutional Law.    Thus is explained the attention that has been given in some of these  pages to the development of certain of the broader doctrines which have  influenced the Court in its determination of constitutional issues,  especially its conception of the nature of the Federal System and of the  proper role of governmental power in relation to private rights. On both  these great subjects the Court's thinking has altered at times--on a few  occasions to such an extent as to transcend Tennyson's idea of the law  \"broadening from precedent to precedent\" and to amount to something  strongly resembling a juridical revolution, bloodless but not wordless.    The first volume of Reports which issued from the Court following  Marshall's death--11 Peters (1837)--signalizes such a revolution, that  is to say, a recasting of fundamental concepts; so does 100 years later,  Volume 301 of the United States Reports, in which the National Labor  Relations Act [The \"Wagner Act\"] and the Social Security Act of 1935  were sustained. Another considerable revolution was marked by the  Court's acceptance in 1925 of the theory that the word \"liberty\" in the  Fourteenth Amendment rendered the restrictions of the First Amendment  upon Congress available also against the States.    In the preparation of this volume constant use has been made of \"The  Constitution of the United States of America Annotated,\" which was  brought out under the editorship of Mr. W.C. Gilbert in 1938. Its  copious listing of cases has been especially valuable. Its admirable  Tables of Contents and Index have furnished a model for those of the  present volume. If this model has been approximated the contents of this  volume ought to be readily accessible despite its size. The coverage of  the volume ends with the cases decided June, 1952.    A personal word or two must be added. The Editor was invited to  undertake this project by Dr. Ernest S. Griffith, Director of the  Legislative Reference Service of the Library of Congress, and his  constant interest in the progress of our labors has been a tremendous  source of encouragement. To his able collaborators the Editor will not  attempt to express his appreciation--they share with him the credit for  such merits as the work possesses and responsibility for its short  comings. And I am sure that they join me in thanking Miss Evelyn K.  Mayhugh for her skill and devotion in aiding us at every step in our  common task.    Edward S. Corwin.          INTRODUCTION      It is my purpose in this Introduction to the _Constitution of the United  States, Annotated_ to sketch rapidly certain outstanding phases of the  Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution for the illustration  they may afford of the interests, ideas, and contingencies which have  from time to time influenced the Court in this still supremely important  area of its powers and of the comparable factors which give direction to  its work in the same field at the present time.    As employed in this country, Constitutional Law signifies a body of  rules resulting from the interpretation by a high court of a written  constitutional instrument in the course of disposing of cases in which  the validity, in relation to the constitutional instrument, of some act  of governmental power, State or national, has been challenged. This  function, conveniently labelled \"Judicial Review,\" involves the power  and duty on the part of the Court of pronouncing void any such act which  does not square with its own reading of the constitutional instrument.  Theoretically, therefore, it is a purely juristic product, and as such  does not alter the meaning. To those who hold this theory, the Court  does not elaborate the instrument, as legislative power might; it  elucidates it, bringing forth into the light of day, as it were, what  was in the instrument from the first.    In the case of judicial review as exercised by the Supreme Court of the  United States in relation to the national Constitution, its preservative  character has been at times a theme of enthusiastic encomium, as in the  following passage from a speech by the late Chief Justice White, made  shortly before he ascended the Bench:          ... The glory and ornament of our system which distinguishes       it from every other government on the face of the earth is       that there is a great and mighty power hovering over the       Constitution of the land to which has been delegated the awful       responsibility of restraining all the coordinate departments       of government within the walls of the governmental fabric       which our fathers built for our protection and immunity.[1]    At other times the subject has been dealt with less enthusiastically,  even skeptically.    One obstacle that the theory encountered very early was the refusal of  certain Presidents to regard the Constitution as primarily a source of  rules for judicial decision. It was rather, they urged, a broadly  discretionary mandate to themselves and to Congress. And pursuing the  logic of this position, they contended that while the Court was  undoubtedly entitled to read the Constitution independently for the  purpose of deciding cases, this very purpose automatically limited the  authoritativeness of its readings; and that within their respective  jurisdictions President and Congress enjoyed the same correlative  independence as the Court did within its jurisdiction. This was, in  effect, the position earlier of Jefferson and Jackson, later of Lincoln,  and in recent times that of the two Roosevelts.    Another obstacle has been of the Court's own making. Whether because of  the difficulty of amending the Constitution or for cautionary reasons,  the Court took the position, as early as 1851, that it would reverse  previous decisions on constitutional issues when convinced they were  erroneous.[2] An outstanding instance of this nature was the decision in  the Legal Tender cases, in 1871, reversing the decision which had been  rendered in Hepburn _v._ Griswold fifteen months earlier;[3] and no less  shattering to the prestige of _stare decisis_ in the constitutional  field was the Income Tax decision of 1895,[4] in which the Court  accepted Mr. Joseph Choate's invitation to \"correct a century of error\".  The \"constitutional revolution\" of 1937 produced numerous reversals of  earlier precedents on the ground of \"error\", some of them, the late Mr.  James M. Beck complained, without \"the obsequious respect of a funeral  oration\".[5] In 1944 Justice Reed cited fourteen cases decided between  March 27, 1937 and June 14, 1943 in which one or more prior  constitutional decisions were overturned.[6] On the same occasion  Justice Roberts expressed the opinion that adjudications of the Court  were rapidly gravitating \"into the same class as a restricted railroad  ticket, good for this day and train only\".[7]    Years ago the eminent historian of the Supreme Court, Mr. Charles  Warren, had written:         However the Court may interpret the provisions of the       Constitution, it is still the Constitution which is the law       and not the decision of the Court.[8]    In short, it is \"not necessarily so\" that the Constitution is preserved  in the Court's reading of it.    A third difficulty "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1864"],[0,"Hero Tales from American History (#2)"],[1,"my resignation depended having  at length taken place, I have now the honor of offering my sincere  congratulations to Congress, and of presenting myself before them, to  surrender into their hands the trust committed to me and to claim the  indulgence of retiring from the service of my country.    Happy in the confirmation of our independence and sovereignity and  pleased with the opportunity afforded the United States of becoming  a respectable nation, I resign with satisfaction the appointment I  accepted with diffidence; a diffidence in my abilities to accomplish so  arduous a task, which, however, was superseded by a confidence in the  rectitude of our cause, the support of the supreme power of the Union,  and the patronage of Heaven.    The successful termination of the war has verified the most sanguine  expectations, and my gratitude for the interposition of Providence and  the assistance I have received from my countrymen increases with every  review of the momentous contest.    While I repeat my obligations to the Army in general, I should do  injustice to my own feelings not to acknowledge, in this place, the  peculiar services and distinguished merits of the Gentlemen who have  been attached to my person during the war. It was impossible that the  choice of confidential officers to compose my family should have been  more fortunate. Permit me, sir, to recommend in particular those  who have continued in service to the present moment as worthy of the  favorable notice and patronage of Congress.    I consider it an indispensable duty to close this last solemn act of my  official life by commending the interests of our dearest country to the  protection of Almighty God, and those who have the superintendence of  them to His holy keeping.    Having now finished the work assigned me, I retire from the great  theatre of action, and, bidding an affectionate farewell to this  august body, under whose orders I have so long acted, I here offer my  commission and take my leave of all the employments of public life.\"    The great master of English fiction, writing of this scene at Annapolis,  says: \"Which was the most splendid spectacle ever witnessed--the opening  feast of Prince George in London, or the resignation of Washington?  Which is the noble character for after ages to admire--yon fribble  dancing in lace and spangles, or yonder hero who sheathes his sword  after a life of spotless honor, a purity unreproached, a courage  indomitable and a consummate victory?\"    Washington did not refuse the dictatorship, or, rather, the opportunity  to take control of the country, because he feared heavy responsibility,  but solely because, as a high-minded and patriotic man, he did not  believe in meeting the situation in that way. He was, moreover, entirely  devoid of personal ambition, and had no vulgar longing for personal  power. After resigning his commission he returned quietly to Mount  Vernon, but he did not hold himself aloof from public affairs. On the  contrary, he watched their course with the utmost anxiety. He saw the  feeble Confederation breaking to pieces, and he soon realized that that  form of government was an utter failure. In a time when no American  statesman except Hamilton had yet freed himself from the local feelings  of the colonial days, Washington was thoroughly national in all his  views. Out of the thirteen jarring colonies he meant that a nation  should come, and he saw--what no one else saw--the destiny of the  country to the westward. He wished a nation founded which should cross  the Alleghanies, and, holding the mouths of the Mississippi, take  possession of all that vast and then unknown region. For these reasons  he stood at the head of the national movement, and to him all men turned  who desired a better union and sought to bring order out of chaos. With  him Hamilton and Madison consulted in the preliminary stages which  were to lead to the formation of a new system. It was his vast personal  influence which made that movement a success, and when the convention  to form a constitution met at Philadelphia, he presided over its  deliberations, and it was his commanding will which, more than anything  else, brought a constitution through difficulties and conflicting  interests which more than once made any result seem well-nigh hopeless.  When the Constitution formed at Philadelphia had been ratified by the  States, all men turned to Washington to stand at the head of the new  government. As he had borne the burden of the Revolution, so he now  took up the task of bringing the government of the Constitution into  existence. For eight years he served as president. He came into  office with a paper constitution, the heir of a bankrupt, broken-down  confederation. He left the United States, when he went out of office,  an effective and vigorous government. When he was inaugurated, we  had nothing but the clauses of the Constitution as agreed to by the  Convention. When he laid down the presidency, we had an organized  government, an established revenue, a funded debt, a high credit, an  efficient system of banking, a strong judiciary, and an army. We had a  vigorous and well-defined foreign policy; we had recovered the western  posts, which, in the hands of the British, had fettered our march to the  west; and we had proved our power to maintain order at home, to repress  insurrection, to collect the national taxes, and to enforce the laws  made by Congress. Thus Washington had shown that rare combination of the  leader who could first destroy by revolution, and who, having led his  country through a great civil war, was then able to build up a new and  lasting fabric upon the ruins of a system which had been overthrown.  At the close of his official service he returned again to Mount Vernon,  and, after a few years of quiet retirement, died just as the century in  which he had played so great a part was closing.    Washington stands among the greatest men of human history, and those in  the same rank with him are very few. Whether measured by what he did, or  what he was, or by the effect of his work upon the history of mankind,  in every aspect he is entitled to the place he holds among the greatest  of his race. Few men in all time have such a record of achievement.  Still fewer can show at the end of a career so crowded with high  deeds and memorable victories a life so free from spot, a character  so unselfish and so pure, a fame so void of doubtful points demanding  either defense or explanation. Eulogy of such a life is needless, but it  is always important to recall and to freshly remember just what manner  of man he was. In the first place he was physically a striking figure.  He was very tall, powerfully made, with a strong, handsome face. He  was remarkably muscular and powerful. As a boy he was a leader in all  outdoor sports. No one could fling the bar further than he, and no one  could ride more difficult horses. As a young man he became a woodsman  and hunter. Day after day he could tramp through the wilderness with his  gun and his surveyor's chain, and then sleep at night beneath the stars.  He feared no exposure or fatigue, and outdid the hardiest backwoodsman  in following a winter trail and swimming icy streams. This habit of  vigorous bodily exercise he carried through life. Whenever he was at  Mount Vernon he gave a large part of his time to fox-hunting, riding  after his hounds through the most difficult country. His physical power  and endurance counted for much in his success when he commanded his  army, and when the heavy anxieties of general and president weighed upon  his mind and heart.    He was an educated, but not a learned man. He read well and remembered  what he read, but his life was, from the beginning, a life of action,  and the world of men was his school. He was not a military genius like  Hannibal, or Caesar, or Napoleon, of which the world has had only three  or four examples. But he was a great soldier of the type which the  English race has produced, like Marlborough and Cromwell, Wellington,  Grant, and Lee. He was patient under defeat, capable of large  combinations, a stubborn and often reckless fighter, a winner of  battles, but much more, a conclusive winner in a long war of varying  fortunes. He was, in addition, what very few great soldiers or  commanders have ever been, a great constitutional statesman, able to  lead a people along the paths of free government without undertaking  himself to play the part of the strong man, the usurper, or the savior  of society.    He was a very silent man. Of no man of equal importance in the world's  history have we so few sayings of a personal kind. He was ready enough  to talk or to write about the public duties which he had in hand, but he  hardly ever talked of himself. Yet there can be no greater error than  to suppose Washington cold and unfeeling, because of his silence and  reserve. He was by nature a man of strong desires and stormy passions.  Now and again he would break out, even as late as the presidency, into  a gust of anger that would sweep everything before it. He was always  reckless of personal danger, and had a fierce fighting spirit which  nothing could check when it was once unchained.    But as a rule these fiery impulses and strong passions were under the  absolute control of an iron will, and they never clouded his judgment or  warped his keen sense of justice.    But if he was not of a cold nature, still less was he hard or unfeeling.  His pity always went out to the poor, the oppressed, or the unhappy, and  he was all that was kind and gentle to those immediately about him.    We have to look carefully into his life to learn all these things, for  the world saw only a silent, reserved man, of courteous and serious  manner, who seemed to stand alone and apart, and who impressed every one  who came near him with a sense of awe and reverence.    One quality he had"]]]
