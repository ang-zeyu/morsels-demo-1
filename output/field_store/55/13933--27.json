[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18755"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part II-II (Secunda Secundae) (#2)"],[1," ten points of inquiry:    (1) Whether the object of faith is the First Truth?    (2) Whether the object of faith is something complex or incomplex,  i.e. whether it is a thing or a proposition?    (3) Whether anything false can come under faith?    (4) Whether the object of faith can be anything seen?    (5) Whether it can be anything known?    (6) Whether the things to be believed should be divided into a  certain number of articles?    (7) Whether the same articles are of faith for all times?    (8) Of the number of articles;    (9) Of the manner of embodying the articles in a symbol;    (10) Who has the right to propose a symbol of faith?  _______________________    FIRST ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 1, Art. 1]    Whether the Object of Faith Is the First Truth?    Objection 1: It would seem that the object of faith is not the First  Truth. For it seems that the object of faith is that which is  proposed to us to be believed. Now not only things pertaining to the  Godhead, i.e. the First Truth, are proposed to us to be believed, but  also things concerning Christ's human nature, and the sacraments of  the Church, and the condition of creatures. Therefore the object of  faith is not only the First Truth.    Obj. 2: Further, faith and unbelief have the same object since they  are opposed to one another. Now unbelief can be about all things  contained in Holy Writ, for whichever one of them a man denies, he is  considered an unbeliever. Therefore faith also is about all things  contained in Holy Writ. But there are many things therein, concerning  man and other creatures. Therefore the object of faith is not only  the First Truth, but also created truth.    Obj. 3: Further, faith is condivided with charity, as stated above  (I-II, Q. 62, A. 3). Now by charity we love not only God, who is the  sovereign Good, but also our neighbor. Therefore the object of Faith  is not only the First Truth.    _On the contrary,_ Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that \"faith is  about the simple and everlasting truth.\" Now this is the First Truth.  Therefore the object of faith is the First Truth.    _I answer that,_ The object of every cognitive habit includes two  things: first, that which is known materially, and is the material  object, so to speak, and, secondly, that whereby it is known, which is  the formal aspect of the object. Thus in the science of geometry, the  conclusions are what is known materially, while the formal aspect of  the science is the mean of demonstration, through which the  conclusions are known.    Accordingly if we consider, in faith, the formal aspect of the  object, it is nothing else than the First Truth. For the faith of  which we are speaking, does not assent to anything, except because it  is revealed by God. Hence the mean on which faith is based is the  Divine Truth. If, however, we consider materially the things to which  faith assents, they include not only God, but also many other things,  which, nevertheless, do not come under the assent of faith, except as  bearing some relation to God, in as much as, to wit, through certain  effects of the Divine operation, man is helped on his journey towards  the enjoyment of God. Consequently from this point of view also the  object of faith is, in a way, the First Truth, in as much as nothing  comes under faith except in relation to God, even as the object of  the medical art is health, for it considers nothing save in relation  to health.    Reply Obj. 1: Things concerning Christ's human nature, and the  sacraments of the Church, or any creatures whatever, come under  faith, in so far as by them we are directed to God, and in as much  as we assent to them on account of the Divine Truth.    The same answer applies to the Second Objection, as regards all  things contained in Holy Writ.    Reply Obj. 3: Charity also loves our neighbor on account of God, so  that its object, properly speaking, is God, as we shall show further  on (Q. 25, A. 1).  _______________________    SECOND ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 1, Art. 2]    Whether the Object of Faith Is Something Complex, by Way of a  Proposition?    Objection 1: It would seem that the object of faith is not something  complex by way of a proposition. For the object of faith is the First  Truth, as stated above (A. 1). Now the First Truth is something  simple. Therefore the object of faith is not something complex.    Obj. 2: Further, the exposition of faith is contained in the symbol.  Now the symbol does not contain propositions, but things: for it is  not stated therein that God is almighty, but: \"I believe in God . . .  almighty.\" Therefore the object of faith is not a proposition but a  thing.    Obj. 3: Further, faith is succeeded by vision, according to 1 Cor.  13:12: \"We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to  face. Now I know in part; but then I shall know even as I am known.\"  But the object of the heavenly vision is something simple, for it is  the Divine Essence. Therefore the faith of the wayfarer is also.    _On the contrary,_ Faith is a mean between science and opinion. Now  the mean is in the same genus as the extremes. Since, then, science  and opinion are about propositions, it seems that faith is likewise  about propositions; so that its object is something complex.    _I answer that,_ The thing known is in the knower according to the  mode of the knower. Now the mode proper to the human intellect is to  know the truth by synthesis and analysis, as stated in the First Part  (Q. 85, A. 5). Hence things that are simple in themselves, are known  by the intellect with a certain amount of complexity, just as on the  other hand, the Divine intellect knows, without any complexity,  things that are complex in themselves.    Accordingly the object of faith may be considered in two ways. First,  as regards the thing itself which is believed, and thus the object of  faith is something simple, namely the thing itself about which we  have faith. Secondly, on the part of the believer, and in this  respect the object of faith is something complex by way of a  proposition.    Hence in the past both opinions have been held with a certain amount  of truth.    Reply Obj. 1: This argument considers the object of faith on the part  of the thing believed.    Reply Obj. 2: The symbol mentions the things about which faith is, in  so far as the act of the believer is terminated in them, as is  evident from the manner of speaking about them. Now the act of the  believer does not terminate in a proposition, but in a thing. For as  in science we do not form propositions, except in order to have  knowledge about things through their means, so is it in faith.    Reply Obj. 3: The object of the heavenly vision will be the First  Truth seen in itself, according to 1 John 3:2: \"We know that when He  shall appear, we shall be like to Him: because we shall see Him as He  is\": hence that vision will not be by way of a proposition but by way  of a simple understanding. On the other hand, by faith, we do not  apprehend the First Truth as it is in itself. Hence the comparison  fails.  _______________________    THIRD ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 1, Art. 3]    Whether Anything False Can Come Under Faith?    Objection 1: It would seem that something false can come under faith.  For faith is condivided with hope and charity. Now something false can  come under hope, since many hope to have eternal life, who will not  obtain it. The same may be said of charity, for many are loved as  being good, who, nevertheless, are not good. Therefore something false  can be the object of faith.    Obj. 2: Further, Abraham believed that Christ would be born,  according to John 8:56: \"Abraham your father rejoiced that he might  see My day: he saw it, and was glad.\" But after the time of Abraham,  God might not have taken flesh, for it was merely because He willed  that He did, so that what Abraham believed about Christ would have  been false. Therefore the object of faith can be something false.    Obj. 3: Further, the ancients believed in the future birth of Christ,  and many continued so to believe, until they heard the preaching of  the Gospel. Now, when once Christ was born, even before He began to  preach, it was false that Christ was yet to be born. Therefore  something false can come under faith.    Obj. 4: Further, it is a matter of faith, that one should believe  that the true Body of Christ is contained in the Sacrament of the  altar. But it might happen that the bread was not rightly  consecrated, and that there was not Christ's true Body there, but  only bread. Therefore something false can come under faith.    _On the contrary,_ No virtue that perfects the intellect is related  to the false, considered as the evil of the intellect, as the  Philosopher declares (Ethic. vi, 2). Now faith is a virtue that  perfects the intellect, as we shall show further on (Q. 4, AA. 2, 5).  Therefore nothing false can come under it.    _I answer that,_ Nothing comes under any power, habit or act, except by  means of the formal aspect of the object: thus color cannot be seen  except by means of light, and a conclusion cannot be known save  through the mean of demonstration. Now it has been stated (A. 1)  that the formal aspect of the object of faith is the First Truth; so  that nothing can come under faith, save in so far as it stands under  the First Truth, under which nothing false can stand, as neither can  non-being stand under being, nor evil under goodness. It follows  therefore that nothing false can come under faith.    Reply Obj. 1: Since the true is the good of the intellect, but not of  the appetitive power, it follows that all virtues which perfect the  intellect, exclude the false altogether, because it belongs to the  nature of a virtue to bear relation to the good alone. On the other  hand those virtues which perfect the appetitive faculty, do not  entirely exclude the false, for it is possible to act in accordance  with justice or temperance, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18757"],[0,"Prince Henry the Navigator, the Hero of Portugal and of Modern Discovery, (#2)"],[1,"    (B. Mus., Map room. From Ottino's reproduction).    One of the oldest and simplest of Christian Mappe-Mondes,    giving a special prominence to Paradise, (with the figures    of Adam, Eve, and the serpent), to the mountains and    rivers of the world, and to the four winds of heaven. It is    to be associated with the Spanish map of 1109, and the    Mappe-Monde of St. Sever.        THE SPANISH-ARABIC MAP OF 1109                           84      (B. Mus., Add. mss., 11695). The original, gorgeously    coloured, represents the crudest of Christian and Moslem    notions of the world. Even more crude than in the Turin    map and the Mappe-Monde of St. Sever, both of which offer    some resemblances to this. The earth is represented as of    quadrangular shape, surrounded by the ocean. At the E.    is Paradise with the figures of the Temptation. A part of    the S. is cut off by the Red Sea, which is straight (and    coloured red), just as the straight Mediterranean, with its    quadrangular islands, divides the N.W. quarter, or Europe,    from the S.W. quarter, or Africa. The AEgean Sea joins    the Mediterranean at a right angle, in the centre of the    map. In the ocean, bordering the whole, are square    islands, _e.g._, Tile (Thule), Britania, Scocia,    Fu(o)rtunarum insula. The Turin map occurs in another    copy of the same work--_A Commentary on the Apocalypse_.        THE PSALTER MAP OF THE 13TH CENTURY                      92      (B. Mus., Add. mss., 28, 681). A good illustration of    the circular type of mediaeval map, which is sometimes    little better than a panorama of legends and monsters.    Christ at the top; the dragons crushed beneath him at the    bottom; Jerusalem, the navel of the earth, in the middle    as a sort of bull's-eye to a target, all show a \"religious\"    geography. The line of queer figures, on the right side,    figuring the S. coast of Africa, suggests a parallel with the    still more fanciful Mappe-Monde of Hereford. (For copy    see Bevan and Phillott's edition of the Hereford map).        THE S.W., OR AFRICAN SECTION OF THE HEREFORD    MAP _c._ 1275-1300                                 106      (B. Mus., King's Lib., XXIII). The S. coast of Africa,    as in the Psalter map, is fringed with monstrous tribes;    monstrous animals fill up a good deal of the interior; half    of the wheel representing Jerusalem in the middle of the    world appears in the N.E. corner; and the designer's idea    of the Mediterranean and Atlantic islands is specially noteworthy.    The Hereford map is a specimen of the thoroughly    traditional and unpractical school of mediaeval geographers    who based their work on books, or fashionable collections    of travellers' tales--such as Pliny, Solinus, or Martianus    Capella--and who are to be distinguished from the scientific    school of the same period, whose best works were the    Portolani, or coast-charts of the early 14th century.        THE WORLD ACCORDING TO MARINO SANUTO. _c._ A.D. 1306   114      (B. Mus., King's Lib., 149 F. 2 p. 282). The shape of    Africa in this map is supposed by some to be valuable in the    history of geographical advance, as suggesting the possibility    of getting round from the Atlantic into the Indian Ocean.        SKETCH MAP OF DULCERT'S PORTOLANO OF 1339               116      (From Nordenskjoeld's fac-simile atlas). This illustrates    the accuracy of the 14th century coast-charts, especially in    the Mediterranean.        THE LAURENTIAN PORTOLANO OF 1351                        120      (From the Medicean Lib. at Florence; reproduced in    B. Mus., Map room, shelf 158, 22, 23). This is the most    remarkable of all the Portolani of the 14th century, as    giving a view of the world, and especially Africa, which is    far nearer the actual truth than could be expected. Especially    its outline of S. Africa and of the bend of the Guinea    coast, is surprisingly near the truth, even as a guess, in    a chart made one hundred and thirty-five years before the    Cape of Good Hope was first rounded.        N.W. SECTION OF THE CATALAN MAP OF 1375-6               124      (B. Mus., Map room, 13, 14). This gives the British    Islands, the W. coasts of Europe, N. Africa as far as Cape    Boyador, and the Canaries and other islands in the Atlantic.    The interior of Africa is filled with fantastic pictures of    native tribes; the boat load of men off Cape Boyador in the    extreme S.W. of the map probably represents the Catalan    explorers of the year 1346, whose voyage in search of the    \"River of Gold\" this map commemorates.        CHART OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA, BY BARENTSZOON          128      (Engraved in copper 1595. Almost an unaltered copy of    a Portolano from the 14th century. From Nordenskjoeld's    fac-simile atlas). This illustrates the remarkable    correctness in the drawing of the Mediterranean basin    and the coasts of W. Europe, reached by the Italian and    Balearic coast-charts, or Portolani, in the 14th century.        THE BORGIAN MAP OF 1450                                 290      (B. Mus., Map room, shelf 2 [6], 13, 14; copy of 1797).    This map was executed just before the fall of Constantinople    (1453), and gives a view of the world as imagined    in the 15th century. It is very fantastic and    unscientific, but remarkable among its kind for its    comparative freedom from ecclesiastical influence.        WESTERN SECTION OF THE MAPPE-MONDE OF FRA    MAURO, 1457-9                                           302      (_Cf._ reproduction in B. Mus., Add. mss., 11267, and    photographic copy in Map room). This map of Fra Mauro    of Murano, (near Venice), is usually understood to be a sort    of picture, not merely of the world as then known, but of    Prince Henry's discoveries in particular on the W. African    coast. From this point of view it is perhaps disappointing;    the inlet of the Rio d'Ouro(?), to the S. of the Sahara,    is exaggerated beyond all recognition; at the S. Cape (of    Good Hope) a great island is depicted, separated from the    mainland by a narrow channel--possibly Madagascar    displaced.        SKETCH-MAP OF FRA MAURO'S MAPPE-MONDE                   304      As reduced and simplified in Lelewel's _Atlas_.    The corners of the table are filled up with four small    circles representing: (1) The Ptolemaic System in the    Spheres. (2) The lunar influences over the tides. (3) The    circles described in the terrestial globe. (4) A picture    of the expulsion from Eden, with the four sacred rivers.        MAP OF 1492                                             322      (B. Mus., Add. mss. 15760). This gives a general view    of the Portuguese discoveries along the whole W. coast of    Africa, and just beyond the Cape of Good Hope, which    was rounded in 1486.    [Footnote 6: **Missing.** Please see the Transcriber's Note  at the foot of the text.]          PREFACE      This volume aims at giving an account, based throughout upon original  sources, of the progress of geographical knowledge and enterprise in  Christendom throughout the Middle Ages, down to the middle or even the  end of the fifteenth century, as well as a life of Prince Henry the  Navigator, who brought this movement of European Expansion within sight  of its greatest successes. That is, as explained in Chapter I., it has  been attempted to treat Exploration as one continuous thread in the  story of Christian Europe from the time of the conversion of the Empire;  and to treat the life of Prince Henry as the turning-point, the central  epoch in a development of many centuries: this life, accordingly, has  been linked as closely as possible with what went before and prepared  for it; one third of the text, at least, has been occupied with the  history of the preparation of the earlier time, and the difference  between our account of the eleventh-and fifteenth-century Discovery, for  instance, will be found to be chiefly one of less and greater detail.  This difference depends, of course, on the prominence in the later time  of a figure of extraordinary interest and force, who is the true hero in  the drama of the Geographical Conquest of the Outer World that starts  from Western Christendom. The interest that centres round Henry is  somewhat clouded by the dearth of complete knowledge of his life; but  enough remains to make something of the picture of a hero, both of  science and of action.    Our subject, then, has been strictly historical, but a history in which  a certain life, a certain biographical centre, becomes more and more  important, till from its completed achievement we get our best outlook  upon the past progress of a thousand years, on this side, and upon the  future progress of those generations which realised the next great  victories of geographical advance.    The series of maps which illustrate this account, give the same  continuous view of the geographical development of Europe and  Christendom down to the end of Prince Henry's age. These are, it is  believed, the first English reproductions in any accessible form of  several of the great charts of the Middle Ages, and taken together they  will give, it is hoped, the best view of Western or Christian map-making  before the time of Columbus that is to be found in any English book,  outside the great historical atlases.    In the same way the text of this volume, especially in the earlier  chapters, tries to supply a want--which is believed to exist--of a  connected account from the originals known to us, of the expansion of  Europe through geographical enterprise, from the conversion of the  Empire to the period of those discoveries which mark most clearly the  transition from the Middle Ages to the Modern World.           *       *       *       *       *    The chief authorities have been:    For the Introductory chapter: (1) Reinaud's account of the Arabic  geographers and their theories in connection with the "]]]
