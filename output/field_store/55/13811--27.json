In  India, where the dragon symbolizes drought and the western river  deities are female, the Manu fish and flood legend resembles closely  the Babylonian, and seems to throw light upon it. Indeed, the Manu  myth appears to have been derived from the lost flood story in which  Ea figured prominently in fish form as the Preserver. The Babylonian  Ea cult and the Indian Varuna cult had apparently much in common, as  is shown.    Throughout this volume special attention has been paid to the various  peoples who were in immediate contact with, and were influenced by,  Mesopotamian civilization. The histories are traced in outline of the  Kingdoms of Elam, Urartu (Ancient Armenia), Mitanni, and the Hittites,  while the story of the rise and decline of the Hebrew civilization, as  narrated in the Bible and referred to in Mesopotamian inscriptions, is  related from the earliest times until the captivity in the  Neo-Babylonian period and the restoration during the age of the  Persian Empire. The struggles waged between the great Powers for the  control of trade routes, and the periodic migrations of pastoral  warrior folks who determined the fate of empires, are also dealt with,  so that light may be thrown on the various processes and influences  associated with the developments of local religions and mythologies.  Special chapters, with comparative notes, are devoted to the  Ishtar-Tammuz myths, the Semiramis legends, Ashur and his symbols, and  the origin and growth of astrology and astronomy.    The ethnic disturbances which occurred at various well-defined periods  in the Tigro-Euphrates valley were not always favourable to the  advancement of knowledge and the growth of culture. The invaders who  absorbed Sumerian civilization may have secured more settled  conditions by welding together political units, but seem to have  exercised a retrogressive influence on the growth of local culture.  \"Babylonian religion\", writes Dr. Langdon, \"appears to have reached  its highest level in the Sumerian period, or at least not later than  2000 B.C. From that period onward to the first century B.C. popular  religion maintained with great difficulty the sacred standards of the  past.\" Although it has been customary to characterize Mesopotamian  civilization as Semitic, modern research tends to show that the  indigenous inhabitants, who were non-Semitic, were its originators.  Like the proto-Egyptians, the early Cretans, and the Pelasgians in  southern Europe and Asia Minor, they invariably achieved the  intellectual conquest of their conquerors, as in the earliest times  they had won victories over the antagonistic forces of nature. If the  modern view is accepted that these ancient agriculturists of the  goddess cult were of common racial origin, it is to the most  representative communities of the widespread Mediterranean race that  the credit belongs of laying the foundations of the brilliant  civilizations of the ancient world in southern Europe, and Egypt, and  the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates.          INTRODUCTION      Ancient Babylonia has made stronger appeal to the imagination of  Christendom than even Ancient Egypt, because of its association with  the captivity of the Hebrews, whose sorrows are enshrined in the  familiar psalm:        By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down;      Yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.      We hanged our harps upon the willows....    In sacred literature proud Babylon became the city of the anti-Christ,  the symbol of wickedness and cruelty and human vanity. Early  Christians who suffered persecution compared their worldly state to  that of the oppressed and disconsolate Hebrews, and, like them, they  sighed for Jerusalem--the new Jerusalem. When St. John the Divine had  visions of the ultimate triumph of Christianity, he referred to its  enemies--the unbelievers and persecutors--as the citizens of the  earthly Babylon, the doom of which he pronounced in stately and  memorable phrases:        Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen,      And is become the habitation of devils,      And the hold of every foul spirit,      And a cage of every unclean and hateful bird....        For her sins have reached unto heaven      And God hath remembered her iniquities....      The merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her,      For no man buyeth their merchandise any more.    \"At the noise of the taking of Babylon\", cried Jeremiah, referring to  the original Babylon, \"the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among  the nations.... It shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall  it be dwelt in from generation to generation.\" The Christian Saint  rendered more profound the brooding silence of the desolated city of  his vision by voicing memories of its beauty and gaiety and bustling  trade:        The voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers and trumpeters          shall be heard no more at all in thee;      And no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any          more in thee;      And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee;      And the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no          more at all in thee:      For thy merchants were the great men of the earth;      For by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.      _And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints,      And of all that were slain upon the earth_.[3]    So for nearly two thousand years has the haunting memory of the  once-powerful city pervaded Christian literature, while its broken  walls and ruined temples and palaces lay buried deep in desert sand.  The history of the ancient land of which it was the capital survived  in but meagre and fragmentary form, mingled with accumulated myths and  legends. A slim volume contained all that could be derived from  references in the Old Testament and the compilations of classical  writers.    It is only within the past half-century that the wonderful story of  early Eastern civilization has been gradually pieced together by  excavators and linguists, who have thrust open the door of the past  and probed the hidden secrets of long ages. We now know more about  \"the land of Babel\" than did not only the Greeks and Romans, but even  the Hebrew writers who foretold its destruction. Glimpses are being  afforded us of its life and manners and customs for some thirty  centuries before the captives of Judah uttered lamentations on the  banks of its reedy canals. The sites of some of the ancient cities of  Babylonia and Assyria were identified by European officials and  travellers in the East early in the nineteenth century, and a few  relics found their way to Europe. But before Sir A.H. Layard set to  work as an excavator in the \"forties\", \"a case scarcely three feet  square\", as he himself wrote, \"enclosed all that remained not only of  the great city of Nineveh, but of Babylon itself\".[4]    Layard, the distinguished pioneer Assyriologist, was an Englishman of  Huguenot descent, who was born in Paris. Through his mother he  inherited a strain of Spanish blood. During his early boyhood he  resided in Italy, and his education, which began there, was continued  in schools in France, Switzerland, and England. He was a man of  scholarly habits and fearless and independent character, a charming  writer, and an accomplished fine-art critic; withal he was a great  traveller, a strenuous politician, and an able diplomatist. In 1845,  while sojourning in the East, he undertook the exploration of ancient  Assyrian cities. He first set to work at Kalkhi, the Biblical Calah.  Three years previously M.P.C. Botta, the French consul at Mosul, had  begun to investigate the Nineveh mounds; but these he abandoned for a  mound near Khorsabad which proved to be the site of the city erected  by \"Sargon the Later\", who is referred to by Isaiah. The relics  discovered by Botta and his successor, Victor Place, are preserved in  the Louvre.    At Kalkhi and Nineveh Layard uncovered the palaces of some of the most  famous Assyrian Emperors, including the Biblical Shalmaneser and  Esarhaddon, and obtained the colossi, bas reliefs, and other treasures  of antiquity which formed the nucleus of the British Museum's  unrivalled Assyrian collection. He also conducted diggings at Babylon  and Niffer (Nippur). His work was continued by his assistant, Hormuzd  Rassam, a native Christian of Mosul, near Nineveh. Rassam studied for  a time at Oxford.    The discoveries made by Layard and Botta stimulated others to follow  their example. In the \"fifties\" Mr. W.K. Loftus engaged in excavations  at Larsa and Erech, where important discoveries were made of ancient  buildings, ornaments, tablets, sarcophagus graves, and pot burials,  while Mr. J.E. Taylor operated at Ur, the seat of the moon cult and  the birthplace of Abraham, and at Eridu, which is generally regarded  as the cradle of early Babylonian (Sumerian) civilization.    In 1854 Sir Henry Rawlinson superintended diggings at Birs Nimrud  (Borsippa, near Babylon), and excavated relics of the Biblical  Nebuchadrezzar. This notable archaeologist began his career in the  East as an officer in the Bombay army. He distinguished himself as a  political agent and diplomatist. While resident at Baghdad, he devoted  his leisure time to cuneiform studies. One of his remarkable feats was  the copying of the famous trilingual rock inscription of Darius the  Great on a mountain cliff at Behistun, in Persian Kurdistan. This work  was carried out at great personal risk, for the cliff is 1700 feet  high and the sculptures and inscriptions are situated about 300 feet  from the ground.    Darius was the first monarch of his line to make use of the Persian  cuneiform script, which in this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16658"],[0,"Piano and Song (#2)"],[1,"  BESSIE. _g_, _a_, _b_, _c_.    DOMINIE. Once more: the first four again, then the next four. That's  right: now all the eight, one after the other, _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_,  _a_, _b_, _c_.    BESSIE. _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_, _a_, _b_, _c_.    DOMINIE. (_after repeating this several times_). That's good: now you  see you have learned something already. That is the musical alphabet,  and those are the names of the white keys on the piano-forte. Presently  you shall find them out, and learn to name them yourself. But, first,  you must take notice (I strike the keys in succession with my finger,  from the one-lined _c_ to the highest treble) that these sounds grow  higher and become sharper one after the other; and in this way (I  strike the keys from one-lined _c_ to the lowest bass) you hear that  the sounds grow lower and heavier. The upper half, to the right, is  called the treble; the lower half is the bass. You quite understand now  the difference between the high sharp tones and the low deep ones? Now  we will go on. What you see here, and will learn to play upon, is called  the key-board, consisting of white keys and black ones. You shall  presently learn to give the right names both to the white keys and the  black; you see there are always two black keys and then three black keys  together, all the way up and down the key-board. Now put the fore-finger  of your right hand on the lower one of any of the two black keys that  are together, and let it slip off on to the white key next below it; now  you have found the key called _c_; what is the name of the next key  above it? Say the whole musical alphabet.    BESSIE. _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_, _a_, _b_, _c_.    DOMINIE. Well, then, that key is called _d_.    BESSIE. Then this one must be _e_.    DOMINIE. And now comes _f_. Anywhere on the key-board you can find _f_  just as easily, if you put your finger on the lowest of any three black  keys that are together, and let it slip off on to the white key next  below it. If you remember where these two keys, _f_ and _c_, are, both  in the treble and the bass, you can easily find the names of all the  other keys. Now what is the next key above _f_?    BESSIE. _g_, and then _a_, _b_, _c_.    DOMINIE. Now we will say over several times the names of the keys,  upwards and downwards, and learn to find them skipping about in any  irregular order. At the end of the lesson we will try them over once  more, and before the next lesson you will know the names of all the  white keys. You must practise finding them out by yourself; you can't  make a mistake, if you are careful to remember where the _c_ and the _f_  are.    I told you that the sounds this way (I strike the keys upward) grow  higher, and this way (I strike them downwards) they grow lower. So you  see no tones are just alike: one is either higher or lower than the  other. Do you hear the difference? Now turn round so as not to see the  keys; I will strike two keys, one after the other; now which is the  highest (the sharpest), the first or the second? (I go on in this way,  gradually touching keys nearer and nearer together; sometimes, in order  to puzzle her and to excite close attention, I strike the lower one  gently and the higher one stronger, and keep on sounding them, lower  and lower towards the bass, according to the capacity of the pupil.) I  suppose you find it a little tiresome to listen so closely; but a  delicate, quick ear is necessary for piano-playing, and by and by it  will become easier to you. But I won't tire you with it any more now, we  will go on to something else. Can you count 3,--1, 2, 3?    BESSIE. Yes, indeed, and more too.    DOMINIE. We'll see; now keep counting 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, as evenly and  regularly as you can. (I lead her to count steadily, and strike at the  same time a chord in three even quarter-notes.) Now we'll see if you can  count evenly by yourself. (I count 1 of the chord with her, and leave  her to count 2 and 3 by herself; or else I count with her at 2, and let  her count 1 and 3 alone; but I am careful to strike the chord promptly  and with precision. Afterwards I strike the chord in eighth-notes, and  let her count 1, 2, 3; in short, I give the chord in various ways, in  order to teach her steadiness in counting, and to confine her attention.  In the same way I teach her to count 1, 2, 1, 2; or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; at  the same time telling her that music is sometimes counted in triple  time, and sometimes in 2/4 or 4/4 time.) Now, Bessie, you have learned  to count very well, and to know the difference in the tones. It is not  every child that learns this in the first lesson. If you don't get tired  of it, you will some time learn to be a good player. As soon as you are  rested, I will tell you about something else, that you will have to  listen to very carefully.    BESSIE. But I like it, and will take pains to listen just as closely as  I can.    DOMINIE. When several tones are struck at the same time, if they sound  well together, they make what we call a chord. But there are both major  and minor chords: the major chord sounds joyous, gay; the minor, sad,  dull, as you would say; the former laugh, the latter weep. Now take  notice whether I am right. (I strike the chord of C major; then, after a  short pause, that of C minor; and try, by a stronger or lighter touch,  to make her listen first to the major and then to the minor chords. She  usually distinguishes correctly; but it will not do to dwell too long  upon these at first, or to try to enforce any thing by too much talk and  explanation.) Now I will tell you that the difference in the sounds of  these chords is in the third, counted upwards from the lower note _c_,  and depends upon whether you take it half a tone higher or lower, _e_  or _e_ flat. I shall explain this better to you by and by, when you come  to learn about the tonic, the third, the fifth or dominant, the octave,  and so on. (It is advantageous and psychologically correct to touch  occasionally, in passing, upon points which will be more thoroughly  taught later. It excites the interest of the pupil. Thus the customary  technical terms are sometimes made use of beforehand, and a needful,  cursory explanation given of them.) That is right; you can tell them  pretty well already; now we will repeat once more the names of the keys,  and then we will stop for to-day. Just see how many things you have  learned in this lesson.    BESSIE. It was beautiful!    DOMINIE. I hope you will always find it so.    BESSIE. When may I have another lesson?    DOMINIE. Day after to-morrow; at first, you must have at least three  lessons a week.    BESSIE. What shall I do in the next lesson?    DOMINIE. I shall repeat all that I have taught you to-day; but I shall  teach you a great deal of it in a different way, and every time I shall  teach it to you differently, so that it shall always be interesting to  you. In the next lesson we will begin to play, first on the table, and  at last on the piano. You will learn to move your fingers lightly and  loosely, and quite independently of the arm, though at first they will  be weak; and you will learn to raise them and let them fall properly.  Besides that, we will contrive a few exercises to teach you to make the  wrist loose, for that must be learned in the beginning in order to  acquire a fine touch on the piano; that is, to make the tones sound as  beautiful as possible. I shall show you how to sit at the piano and how  to hold your hands. You will learn the names of the black keys and the  scale of C, with the half-step from the 3d to the 4th and also that from  the 7th to the 8th, which latter is called the leading note, which leads  into C. (This is quite important for my method, for in this way the  different keys can be clearly explained.) You will learn to find the  chord of C in the bass and the treble, and to strike them with both  hands together. And then in the third or fourth lesson, after you know  quite perfectly all that I have already taught you, I will teach you to  play a little piece that will please you, and then you will really be a  player, a pianist.    FRIEND. From whom have you learned all this? It goes like the  lightning-train.    DOMINIE. A great many people can learn _what_ is to be taught; but  _how_ it is to be taught I have only found out by devoting my whole  mind, with real love and constant thought, to the musical improvement  and general mental development of my pupils. The advancement will  unquestionably be rapid, for it proceeds step by step, and one thing is  founded upon another; the pupil learns every thing quietly,  thoughtfully, and surely, without going roundabout, without any  hindrances and mistakes to be unlearned. I never try to teach too much  or too little; and, in teaching each thing, I try to prepare and lay the  foundation for other things to be afterwards learned. I consider it very  important not to try to cram the child's memory with the teacher's  wisdom (as is often done in a crude and harsh way); but I endeavor to  excite the pupil's mind, to interest it, and to let it develop itself,  and not to degrade it to a mere machine. I do not require the practice  of a vague, dreary, time and mind killing piano-jingling, in which way,  as I see, your little Susie was obliged to learn; but I observe a  musical method, and in doing this always keep strictly in view the  individuality and gradual development of the pupil. In more advanced  instruction, I even take an interest in the general culture and  disposition of the pupil, and improve every opportunity to call forth  the sense of beauty, and continually to aid in the intellectual  development.    FRIEND. But where are the notes all this time?    DOMINIE. Before that, we have a great deal to do that is interesting and  agreeable. I keep constantly in view the formation of a good technique;  but I do not make piano-playing distasteful to the pupil by urging "]]]
