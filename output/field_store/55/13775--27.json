When  Aaron Burr made his first dashing expedition down to New Orleans in  1805, at Fort Massac, or somewhere above on the river, he met, as the  Devil would have it, this gay, dashing, bright young fellow, at some  dinner-party, I think. Burr marked him, talked to him, walked with him,  took him a day or two's voyage in his flat-boat, and, in short,  fascinated him. For the next year, barrack-life was very tame to poor  Nolan. He occasionally availed himself of the permission the great man  had given him to write to him. Long, high-worded, stilted letters the  poor boy wrote and rewrote and copied. But never a line did he have in  reply from the gay deceiver. The other boys in the garrison sneered at  him, because he sacrificed in this unrequited affection for a politician  the time which they devoted to Monongahela, hazard, and high-low-jack.  Bourbon, euchre, and poker were still unknown. But one day Nolan had his  revenge. This time Burr came down the river, not as an attorney seeking  a place for his office, but as a disguised conqueror. He had defeated I  know not how many district-attorneys; he had dined at I know not how  many public dinners; he had been heralded in I know not how many Weekly  Arguses, and it was rumored that he had an army behind him and an empire  before him. It was a great day--his arrival--to poor Nolan. Burr had not  been at the fort an hour before he sent for him. That evening he asked  Nolan to take him out in his skiff, to show him a canebrake or a  cotton-wood tree, as he said,--really to seduce him; and by the time the  sail was over, Nolan was enlisted body and soul. From that time, though  he did not yet know it, he lived as A MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY.    What Burr meant to do I know no more than you, dear reader. It is none  of our business just now. Only, when the grand catastrophe came, and  Jefferson and the House of Virginia of that day undertook to break on  the wheel all the possible Clarences of the then House of York, by the  great treason-trial at Richmond, some of the lesser fry in that distant  Mississippi Valley, which was farther from us than Puget's Sound is  to-day, introduced the like novelty on their provincial stage, and, to  while away the monotony of the summer at Fort Adams, got up, for  _spectacles_, a string of court-martials on the officers there. One and  another of the colonels and majors were tried, and, to fill out the  list, little Nolan, against whom, Heaven knows, there was evidence  enough,--that he was sick of the service, had been willing to be false  to it, and would have obeyed any order to march any-whither with any  one who would follow him had the order been signed, \"By command of His  Exc. A. Burr.\" The courts dragged on. The big flies escaped,--rightly  for all I know. Nolan was proved guilty enough, as I say; yet you and I  would never have heard of him, reader, but that, when the president of  the court asked him at the close, whether he wished to say anything to  show that he had always been faithful to the United States, he cried  out, in a fit of frenzy,--    \"D----n the United States! I wish I may never hear of the United States  again!\"    I suppose he did not know how the words shocked old Colonel Morgan, who  was holding the court. Half the officers who sat in it had served  through the Revolution, and their lives, not to say their necks, had  been risked for the very idea which he so cavalierly cursed in his  madness. He, on his part, had grown up in the West of those days, in the  midst of \"Spanish plot,\" \"Orleans plot,\" and all the rest. He had been  educated on a plantation where the finest company was a Spanish officer  or a French merchant from Orleans. His education, such as it was, had  been perfected in commercial expeditions to Vera Cruz, and I think he  told me his father once hired an Englishman to be a private tutor for a  winter on the plantation. He had spent half his youth with an older  brother, hunting horses in Texas; and, in a word, to him \"United States\"  was scarcely a reality. Yet he had been fed by \"United States\" for all  the years since he had been in the army. He had sworn on his faith as a  Christian to be true to \"United States.\" It was \"United States\" which  gave him the uniform he wore, and the sword by his side. Nay, my poor  Nolan, it was only because \"United States\" had picked you out first as  one of her own confidential men of honor that \"A. Burr\" cared for you a  straw more than for the flat-boat men who sailed his ark for him. I do  not excuse Nolan; I only explain to the reader why he damned his  country, and wished he might never hear her name again.    He never did hear her name but once again. From that moment, September  23, 1807, till the day he died, May 11, 1863, he never heard her name  again. For that half-century and more he was a man without a country.    Old Morgan, as I said, was terribly shocked. If Nolan had compared  George Washington to Benedict Arnold, or had cried, \"God save King  George,\" Morgan would not have felt worse. He called the court into his  private room, and returned in fifteen minutes, with a face like a sheet,  to say,--    \"Prisoner, hear the sentence of the Court! The Court decides, subject to  the approval of the President, that you never hear the name of the  United States again.\"    Nolan laughed. But nobody else laughed. Old Morgan was too solemn, and  the whole room was hushed dead as night for a minute. Even Nolan lost  his swagger in a moment. Then Morgan added,--    \"Mr. Marshal, take the prisoner to Orleans in an armed boat, and deliver  him to the naval commander there.\"    The Marshal gave his orders and the prisoner was taken out of court.    \"Mr. Marshal,\" continued old Morgan, \"see that no one mentions the  United States to the prisoner. Mr. Marshal, make my respects to  Lieutenant Mitchell at Orleans, and request him to order that no one  shall mention the United States to the prisoner while he is on board  ship. You will receive your written orders from the officer on duty here  this evening. The court is adjourned without day.\"    I have always supposed that Colonel Morgan himself took the proceedings  of the court to Washington City, and explained them to Mr. Jefferson.  Certain it is that the President approved them,--certain, that is, if I  may believe the men who say they have seen his signature. Before the  Nautilus got round from New Orleans to the Northern Atlantic coast with  the prisoner on board the sentence had been approved, and he was a man  without a country.    The plan then adopted was substantially the same which was necessarily  followed ever after. Perhaps it was suggested by the necessity of  sending him by water from Fort Adams and Orleans. The Secretary of the  Navy--it must have been the first Crowninshield, though he is a man I do  not remember--was requested to put Nolan on board a government vessel  bound on a long cruise, and to direct that he should be only so far  confined there as to make it certain that he never saw or heard of the  country. We had few long cruises then, and the navy was very much out of  favor; and as almost all of this story is traditional, as I have  explained, I do not know certainly what his first cruise was. But the  commander to whom he was intrusted,--perhaps it was Tingey or Shaw,  though I think it was one of the younger men,--we are all old enough  now,--regulated the etiquette and the precautions of the affair, and  according to his scheme they were carried out, I suppose, till Nolan  died.    When I was second officer of the \"Intrepid,\" some thirty years after, I  saw the original paper of instructions. I have been sorry ever since  that I did not copy the whole of it. It ran, however, much in this  way:--        \"WASHINGTON (with a date, which have been late in 1807).        \"SIR,--You will receive from Lieutenant Neale the person of Philip      Nolan, late a Lieutenant in the United States Army.        \"This person on his trial by court-martial expressed with an oath      the wish that he might 'never hear of the United States again.'        \"The Court sentenced him to have his wish fulfilled.        \"For the present, the execution of the order is intrusted by the      President to this Department.        \"You will take the prisoner on board your ship, and keep him there      with such precautions as shall prevent his escape.        \"You will provide him with such quarters, rations, and clothing as      would be proper for an officer of his late rank, if he were a      passenger on your vessel on the business of his Government.        \"The gentlemen on board will make any arrangements agreeable to      themselves regarding his society. He is to be exposed to no      indignity of any kind, nor is he ever unnecessarily to be reminded      that he is a prisoner.        \"But under no circumstances is he ever to hear of his country or      to see any information regarding it, and you will specially      caution all the officers under your command to take care, that, in      the various indulgences which may be granted, this rule, in which      his punishment is involved, shall not be broken.        \"It is the intention of the Government that he shall never again      see the country which he has disowned. Before the end of your      cruise you will receive orders which will give effect to this      intention.        \"Respectfully yours,        \"W. SOUTHARD, for the Secretary of the Navy.\"    If I had only preserved the whole of this paper, there would be no break  in the beginning of my sketch of this story. For Captain Shaw, if it  were he, handed it to his successor in the charge, and he to his, and I  suppose the commander of the Levant has it to-day as his authority for  keeping this man in this mild custody.    The rule adopted on board the ships on which I have met \"the man without  a country\" was, I think, transmitted from the beginning.

After ranging the coast for some miles, without seeing a living soul, or  any convenient landing-place, we at length came before a small beach, on  which lay four canoes. Here we landed by means of a little creek, formed by  the flat rocks before it, with a view of just looking at the canoes, and to  leave some medals, nails, etc. in them; for not a soul was to be seen. The  situation of this place was to us worse than the former. A flat rock lay  next the sea; behind it a narrow stone beach; this was bounded by a  perpendicular rocky cliff of unequal height, whose top was covered with  shrubs; two deep and narrow chasms in the cliff seemed to open a  communication into the country. In or before one of these lay the four  canoes which we were going to look at; but in the doing of this, I saw we  should be exposed to an attack from the natives, if there were any, without  being in a situation proper for defence. To prevent this, as much as could  be, and to secure a retreat in case of an attack, I ordered the men to be  drawn up upon the rock, from whence they had a view of the heights; and  only myself, and four of the gentlemen, went up to the canoes. We had been  there but a few minutes, before the natives, I cannot say how many, rushed  down the chasm out of the wood upon us. The endeavours we used to bring  them to a parley, were to no purpose; for they came with the ferocity of  wild boars, and threw their darts. Two or three muskets, discharged in the  air did not hinder one of them from advancing still farther, and throwing  another dart, or rather a spear, which passed close over my shoulder. His  courage would have cost him his life, had not my musket missed fire; for I  was not five paces from him when he threw his spear, and had resolved to  shoot him to save myself. I was glad afterwards that it happened as it did.  At this instant, our men on the rock began to fire at others who appeared  on the heights, which abated the ardour of the party we were engaged with,  and gave us time to join our people, when I caused the firing to cease. The  last discharge sent all the islanders to the woods, from whence they did  not return so long as we remained. We did not know that any were hurt. It  was remarkable, that when I joined our party, I tried my musket in the air,  and it went off as well as a piece could do. Seeing no good was to be got  with these people, or at the isle, as having no port, we returned on board,  and having hoisted in the boats, made sail to the W.S.W. I had forgot to  mention in its proper order, that having put ashore a little before we came  to this last place, three or four of us went upon the cliffs, where we  found the country, as before, nothing but coral rocks, all over-run with  bushes, so that it was hardly possible to penetrate into it; and we  embarked again with intent to return directly on board, till we saw the  canoes; being directed to the place by the opinion of some of us, who  thought they heard some people.    The conduct and aspect of these islanders occasioned my naming it Savage  Island. It is situated in the latitude 19 deg. 1' S. longitude 169 deg. 37' W. It  is about eleven leagues in circuit; of a round form, and good height; and  hath deep waters close to its shores. All the sea-coast, and as far inland  as we could see, is wholly covered with trees, shrubs, etc.; amongst which  were some cocoa-nut trees; but what the interior parts may produce we know  not. To judge of the whole garment by the skirts, it cannot produce much;  for so much as we saw of it consisted wholly of coral rocks, all over-run  with woods and bushes. Not a bit of soil was to be seen; the rocks alone  supplying the trees with humidity. If these coral rocks were first formed  in the sea by animals, how came they thrown up to such an height? Has this  island been raised by an earthquake? Or has the sea receded from it? Some  philosophers have attempted to account for the formation of low isles, such  as are in the sea; but I do not know that any thing has been said of high  islands, or such as I have been speaking of. In this island, not only the  loose rocks which cover the surface, but the cliffs which bound the shores,  are of coral stone, which the continual beating of the sea has formed into  a variety of curious caverns, some of them very large: The roof or rock  over them being supported by pillars, which the foaming waves have formed  into a multitude of shapes, and made more curious than the caverns  themselves. In one we saw light was admitted through a hole at the top; in  another place, we observed that the whole roof of one of these caverns had  sunk in, and formed a kind of valley above, which lay considerably below  the circumjacent rocks.    I can say but little of the inhabitants, who, I believe, are not numerous.  They seemed to be stout well-made men, were naked except round the waists,  and some of them had their faces, breasts, and thighs painted black. The  canoes were precisely like those of Amsterdam; with the addition of a  little rising like a gunwale on each side of the open part; and had some  carving about them, which shewed that these people are full as ingenious.  Both these islanders and their canoes agree very well with the description  M. de Bougainville has given of those he saw off the Isle of Navigators,  which lies nearly under the same meridian.    After leaving Savage Island, we continued to steer W.S.W. with a fine  easterly trade-wind, till the 24th in the evening, when, judging ourselves  not far from Rotterdam, we brought-to, and spent the night plying under the  top-sails. At daybreak next morning, we bore away west; and soon after, saw  a string of islands extending from S.S.W. by the west to N.N.W. The wind  being at N.E., we hauled to N.W., with a view of discovering more  distinctly the isles in that quarter; but, presently after, we discovered a  reef of rocks a-head, extending on each bow farther than we could see. As  we could not weather them, it became necessary to tack and bear up to the  south, to look for a passage that way. At noon the southernmost island bore  S.W., distant four miles. North of this isle were three others, all  connected by breakers, which we were not sure did not join to those we had  seen in the morning, as some were observed in the intermediate space. Some  islands were also seen to the west of those four; but Rotterdam was not yet  in sight. Latitude 20 deg. 23' S. longitude 174 deg. 6' W. During the whole  afternoon, we had little wind; so that at sunset, the southernmost isle  bore W.N.W., distant five miles; and some breakers, we had seen to the  south, bore now S.S.W. 1/2 W. Soon after it fell calm, and we were left to  the mercy of a great easterly swell; which, however, happened to have no  great effect upon the ship. The calm continued till four o'clock the next  morning, when it was succeeded by a breeze from the south. At day-light,  perceiving a likelihood of a passage between the islands to the north and  the breakers to the south, we stretched in west, and soon after saw more  islands, both to the S.W. and N.W., but the passage seemed open and clear.  Upon drawing near the islands, we sounded, and found forty-five and forty  fathoms, a clear sandy bottom. I was now quite easy, since it was in our  power to anchor, in case of a calm; or to spend the night, if we found no  passage. Towards noon some canoes came off to us from one of the isles,  having two or three people in each; who advanced boldly alongside, and  exchanged some cocoa-nuts, and shaddocks, for small nails. They pointed out  to us Anamocka, or Rotterdam; an advantage we derived from knowing the  proper names. They likewise gave us the names of some of the other isles,  and invited us much to go to theirs, which they called Cornango. The breeze  freshening, we left them astern, and steered for Anamocka; meeting with a  clear passage, in which we found unequal sounding, from forty to nine  fathoms, depending, I believe, in a great measure, on our distance from the  islands which form it.    As we drew near the south end of Rotterdam, or Anamocka, we were met by a  number of canoes, laden with fruit and roots; but as I did not shorten  sail, we had but little traffic with them. The people in one canoe enquired  for me by name; a proof that these people have an intercourse with those of  Amsterdam. They importuned us much to go towards their coast, letting us  know, as we understood them, that we might anchor there. This was on the  S.W. side of the island, where the coast seemed to be sheltered from the S.  and S.E. winds; but as the day was far spent, I could not attempt to go in  there, as it would have been necessary to have sent first a boat to examine  it. I therefore stood for the north side of the island, where we anchored  about three-fourths of a mile from shore; the extremes of it bearing south,  88 deg. E. to S.W.; a cove with a sandy beach at the bottom of it S. 50 deg. E.    CHAPTER II.    _Reception at Anamocka; a Robbery and its Consequences, with a Variety of  other Incidents.
