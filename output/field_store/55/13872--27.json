In the cocoanut trees, kites, like  ministers of state, look around to see on what they can pounce; the  cranes, being only small fry, stand raking in the mud; the _dahuk_  (coloured herons), merry creatures, dive in the water; other birds of  a lighter kind merely fly about. Market-boats sail along at good speed  on their own behalf; ferry-boats creep along at elephantine pace to  serve the needs of others only: cargo boats make no progress at  all--that is the owners' concern.    On the third day of Nagendra's journey clouds arose and gradually  covered the sky. The river became black, the tree-tops drooped, the  paddy birds flew aloft, the water became motionless. Nagendra ordered  the _manji_ (boatman) to run the boat in shore and make it fast. At  that moment the steersman, Rahamat Mullah, was saying his prayers, so  he made no answer. Rahamat knew nothing of his business. His mother's  father's sister was the daughter of a boatman; on that plea he had  become a hanger-on of boatmen, and accident favoured his wishes; but  he learned nothing, his work was done as fate willed. Rahamat was not  backward in speech, and when his prayers were ended he turned to the  Babu and said, \"Do not be alarmed, sir, there is no cause for fear.\"  Rahamat was thus brave because the shore was close at hand, and could  be reached without delay, and in a few minutes the boat was secured.    Surely the gods must have had a quarrel with Rahamat Mullah, for a  great storm came up quickly. First came the wind; then the wind,  having wrestled for some moments with the boughs of the trees, called  to its brother the rain, and the two began a fine game. Brother Rain,  mounting on brother Wind's shoulders, flew along. The two together,  seizing the tree-tops, bent them down, broke the boughs, tore off the  creepers, washed away the flowers, cast up the river in great waves,  and made a general tumult. One brother flew off with Rahamat Mullah's  head-gear; the other made a fountain of his beard. The boatmen lowered  the sail, the Babu closed the windows, and the servants put the  furniture under shelter.    Nagendra was in a great strait. If, in fear of the storm, he should  leave the boat, the men would think him a coward; if he remained he  would break his word to Surja Mukhi. Some may ask, What harm if he  did? We know not, but Nagendra thought it harm. At this moment Rahamat  Mullah said, \"Sir, the rope is old; I do not know what may happen. The  storm has much increased; it will be well to leave the boat.\"  Accordingly Nagendra got out.    No one can stand on the river bank without shelter in a heavy storm of  rain. There was no sign of abatement; therefore Nagendra, thinking it  necessary to seek for shelter, set out to walk to the village, which  was at some distance from the river, through miry paths. Presently the  rain ceased, the wind abated slightly, but the sky was still thickly  covered with clouds; therefore both wind and rain might be expected at  night. Nagendra went on, not turning back.    Though it was early in the evening, there was thick darkness, because  of the clouds. There was no sign of village, house, plain, road, or  river; but the trees, being surrounded by myriads of fireflies,  looked like artificial trees studded with diamonds. The lightning  goddess also still sent quick flashes through the now silent black and  white clouds. A woman's anger does not die away suddenly. The  assembled frogs, rejoicing in the newly fallen rain, held high  festival; and if you listened attentively the voice of the cricket  might be heard, like the undying crackle of Ravana's[1] funeral pyre.  Amid the sounds might be distinguished the fall of the rain-drops on  the leaves of the trees, and that of the leaves into the pools  beneath; the noise of jackals' feet on the wet paths, occasionally  that of the birds on the trees shaking the water from their drenched  feathers, and now and then the moaning of the almost subdued wind.  Presently Nagendra saw a light in the distance. Traversing the flooded  earth, drenched by the drippings from the trees, and frightening away  the jackals, he approached the light; and on nearing it with much  difficulty, saw that it proceeded from an old brick-built house, the  door of which was open. Leaving his servant outside, Nagendra entered  the house, which he found in a frightful condition.    [Footnote 1: King of Lanka (Ceylon), whose remains were to burn  without ceasing.]    It was not quite an ordinary house, but it had no sign of prosperity.  The door-frames were broken and dirty; there was no trace of human  occupation--only owls, mice, reptiles, and insects gathered there.  The light came only from one side. Nagendra saw some articles of  furniture for human use; but everything indicated poverty. One or two  cooking vessels, a broken oven, three or four brass dishes--these were  the sole ornaments of the place. The walls were black; spiders' webs  hung in the corners; cockroaches, spiders, lizards, and mice,  scampered about everywhere. On a dilapidated bedstead lay an old man  who seemed to be at death's door; his eyes were sunk, his breath  hurried, his lips trembling. By the side of his bed stood an earthen  lamp upon a fragment of brick taken from the ruins of the house. In it  the oil was deficient; so also was it in the body of the man. Another  lamp shone by the bedside--a girl of faultlessly fair face, of soft,  starry beauty.    Whether because the light from the oil-less lamp was dim, or because  the two occupants of the house were absorbed in thinking of their  approaching separation, Nagendra's entrance was unseen. Standing in  the doorway, he heard the last sorrowful words that issued from the  mouth of the old man. These two, the old man and the young girl, were  friendless in this densely-peopled world. Once they had had wealth,  relatives, men and maid servants--abundance of all kinds; but by the  fickleness of fortune, one after another, all had gone. The mother of  the family, seeing the faces of her son and daughter daily fading like  the dew-drenched lotus from the pinch of poverty, had early sunk upon  the bed of death. All the other stars had been extinguished with that  moon. The support of the race, the jewel of his mother's eye, the hope  of his father's age, even he had been laid on the pyre before his  father's eyes. No one remained save the old man and this enchanting  girl. They dwelt in this ruined, deserted house in the midst of the  forest. Each was to the other the only helper.    Kunda Nandini was of marriageable age; but she was the staff of her  father's blindness, his only bond to this world. While he lived he  could give her up to no one. \"There are but a few more days; if I give  away Kunda where can I abide?\" were the old man's thoughts when the  question of giving her in marriage arose in his mind. Had it never  occurred to him to ask himself what would become of Kunda when his  summons came? Now the messenger of death stood at his bedside; he was  about to leave the world; where would Kunda be on the morrow?    The deep, indescribable suffering of this thought expressed itself in  every failing breath. Tears streamed from his eyes, ever restlessly  closing and opening, while at his head sat the thirteen-year-old girl,  like a stone figure, firmly looking into her father's face, covered  with the shadows of death. Forgetting herself, forgetting to think  where she would go on the morrow, she gazed only on the face of her  departing parent. Gradually the old man's utterance became obscure,  the breath left the throat, the eyes lost their light, the suffering  soul obtained release from pain. In that dark place, by that  glimmering lamp, the solitary Kunda Nandini, drawing her father's dead  body on to her lap, remained sitting. The night was extremely dark;  even now rain-drops fell, the leaves of the trees rustled, the wind  moaned, the windows of the ruined house flapped noisily. In the  house, the fitful light of the lamp flickered momentarily on the face  of the dead, and again left it in darkness. The lamp had long been  exhausted of oil; now, after two or three flashes, it went out. Then  Nagendra, with noiseless steps, went forth from the doorway.          CHAPTER II.    \"COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE.\"      It was night. In the ruined house Kunda Nandini sat by her father's  corpse. She called \"Father!\" No one made reply. At one moment Kunda  thought her father slept, again that he was dead, but she could not  bring that thought clearly into her mind. At length she could no  longer call, no longer think. The fan still moved in her hand in the  direction where her father's once living body now lay dead. At length  she resolved that he slept, for if he were dead what would become of  her?    After days and nights of watching amid such sorrow, sleep fell upon  her. In that exposed, bitterly cold house, the palm-leaf fan in her  hand, Kunda Nandini rested her head upon her arm, more beauteous than  the lotus-stalk, and slept; and in her sleep she saw a vision. It  seemed as if the night were bright and clear, the sky of a pure  blue--that glorious blue when the moon is encircled by a halo. Kunda  had never seen the halo so large as it seemed in her vision. The light  was splendid, and refreshing to the eyes. But in the midst of that  magnificent halo there was no moon; in its place Kunda saw the figure  of a goddess of unparalleled brilliance. It seemed as if this  brilliant goddess-ruled halo left the upper sky and descended  gradually lower, throwing out a thousand rays of light, until it stood  over Kunda's head. Then she saw that the central beauty, crowned with  golden hair, and decked with jewels, had the form of a woman. The  beautiful, compassionate face had a loving smile upon its lips. Kunda  recognized, with mingled joy and fear, in this compassionate being  the features of her long-dead mother.

In the distance she could see Osh Popham's two-story house brilliantly  illuminated by kerosene lamps, and as she drew nearer she even  descried Ossian himself, seated at the cabinet organ in his  shirt-sleeves, practicing the Christmas anthem, his daughter holding a  candle to the page while she struggled to adjust a circuitous alto to  her father's tenor. On the hither side of the Popham house, and quite  obscured by it, stood Letitia Boynton's one-story gray cottage. It had  a clump of tall cedar trees for background and the bare branches of  the elms in front were hung lightly with snow garlands. As Mrs.  Larrabee came closer, she set down her lantern and looked fixedly at  the familiar house as if something new arrested her gaze.    \"It looks like a little night-light!\" she thought. \"And how queer of  Letty to be sitting at the open window!\"    Nearer still she crept, yet not so near as to startle her friend. A  tall brass candlestick, with a lighted tallow candle in it, stood on  the table in the parlor window; but the room in which Letty sat was  unlighted save by the fire on the hearth, which gleamed brightly  behind the quaint andirons--Hessian soldiers of iron, painted in gay  colors. Over the mantel hung the portrait of Letty's mother, a benign  figure clad in black silk, the handsome head topped by a snowy muslin  cap with floating strings. Just round the corner of the fireplace was  a half-open door leading into a tiny bedroom, and the flickering flame  lighted the heads of two sleeping children, arms interlocked, bright  tangled curls flowing over one pillow.    Letty herself sat in a low chair by the open window wrapped in an old  cape of ruddy brown homespun, from the folds of which her delicate  head rose like a flower in a bouquet of autumn leaves. One elbow  rested on the table; her chin in the cup of her hand. Her head was  turned away a little so that one could see only the knot of bronze  hair, the curve of a cheek, and the sweep of an eyelash.    \"What a picture!\" thought Reba. \"The very thing for my Christmas card!  It would do almost without a change, if only she is willing to let me  use her.\"    \"Wake up, Letty!\" she called. \"Come and let me in!--Why, your front  door isn't closed!\"    \"The fire smoked a little when I first lighted it,\" said Letty, rising  when her friend entered, and then softly shutting the bedroom door  that the children might not waken. \"The night is so mild and the room  so warm, I couldn't help opening the window to look at the moon on the  snow. Sit down, Reba! How good of you to come when you've been  rehearsing for the Christmas Tree exercises all the afternoon.\"          [Illustration]    II      \"It's never 'good' of me to come to talk with you, Letty!\" And the  minister's wife sank into a comfortable seat and took off her  rigolette. \"Enough virtue has gone out of me to-day to Christianize an  entire heathen nation! Oh! how I wish Luther would go and preach to a  tribe of cannibals somewhere, and make me superintendent of the  Sabbath-School! How I should like to deal, just for a change, with  some simple problem like the undesirability and indigestibility  involved in devouring your next-door neighbor! Now I pass my life in  saying, 'Love your neighbor as yourself'; which is far more difficult  than to say, 'Don't _eat_ your neighbor, it's such a disgusting  habit,--and wrong besides,'--though I dare say they do it half the  time because the market is bad. The first thing I'd do would be to get  my cannibals to raise sheep. If they ate more mutton, they wouldn't  eat so many missionaries.\"    Letty laughed. \"You're so funny, Reba dear, and I was so sad before  you came in. Don't let the minister take you to the cannibals until  after I die!\"    \"No danger!--Letty, do you remember I told you I'd been trying my hand  on some verses for a Christmas card?\"    \"Yes; have you sent them anywhere?\"    \"Not yet. I couldn't think of the right decoration and color scheme  and was afraid to trust it all to the publishers. Now I've found just  what I need for one of them, and you gave it to me, Letty!\"    \"I?\"    \"Yes, you; to-night, as I came down the road. The house looked so  quaint, backed by the dark cedars, and the moon and the snow made  everything dazzling. I could see the firelight through the open  window, the Hessian soldier andirons, your mother's portrait, the  children asleep in the next room, and you, wrapped in your cape  waiting or watching for something or somebody.\"    \"I wasn't watching or waiting! I was dreaming,\" said Letty hurriedly.    \"You looked as if you were watching, anyway, and I thought if I were  painting the picture I would call it 'Expectancy,' or 'The Vigil,' or  'Sentry Duty.' However, when I make you into a card, Letty, nobody  will know what the figure at the window means, till they read my  verses.\"    \"I'll give you the house, the room, the andirons, and even mother's  portrait, but you don't mean that you want to put _me_ on the card?\"  And Letty turned like a startled deer as she rose and brushed a spark  from the hearth-rug.    \"No, not the whole of you, of course, though I'm not clever enough to  get a likeness even if I wished. I merely want to make a color sketch  of your red-brown cape, your hair that matches it, your ear, an inch  of cheek, and the eyelashes of one eye, if you please, ma'am.\"    \"That doesn't sound quite so terrifying.\" And Letty looked more  manageable.    \"Nobody'll ever know that a real person sat at a real window and that  I saw her there; but when I send the card with a finished picture, and  my verses beautifully lettered on it, the printing people will be more  likely to accept it.\"    \"And if they do, shall I have a dozen to give to my Bible-class?\"  asked Letty in a wheedling voice.    \"You shall have more than that! I'm willing to divide my magnificent  profits with you. You will have furnished the picture and I the  verses. It's wonderful, Letty,--it's providential! You just _are_ a  Christmas card to-night! It seems so strange that you even put the  lighted candle in the window when you never heard my verse. The candle  caught my eye first, and I remembered the Christmas customs we studied  for the church festival,--the light to guide the Christ Child as he  walks through the dark streets on the Eve of Mary.\"    \"Yes, I thought of that,\" said Letty, flushing a little. \"I put the  candle there first so that the house shouldn't be all dark when the  Pophams went by to choir-meeting, and just then I--I remembered, and  was glad I did it!\"    \"These are my verses, Letty.\" And Reba's voice was soft as she turned  her face away and looked at the flames mounting upward in the  chimney:--        My door is on the latch to-night,        The hearth fire is aglow.      I seem to hear swift passing feet,--        The Christ Child in the snow.        My heart is open wide to-night        For stranger, kith or kin.      I would not bar a single door        Where Love might enter in!    There was a moment's silence and Letty broke it. \"It means the sort of  love the Christ Child brings, with peace and good-will in it. I'm glad  to be a part of that card, Reba, so long as nobody knows me, and--\"    Here she made an impetuous movement and, covering her eyes with her  hands, burst into a despairing flood of confidence, the words crowding  each other and tumbling out of her mouth as if they feared to be  stopped.    \"After I put the candle on the table ... I could not rest for thinking ...  I wasn't ready in my soul to light the Christ Child on his way ... I was  bitter and unresigned ... It is three years to-night since the children  were born ... and each year I have hoped and waited and waited and hoped,  thinking that David might remember. David! my brother, their father! Then  the fire on the hearth, the moon and the snow quieted me, and I felt that I  wanted to open the door, just a little. No one will notice that it's ajar,  I thought, but there's a touch of welcome in it, anyway. And after a few  minutes I said to myself: 'It's no use, David won't come; but I'm glad the  firelight shines on mother's picture, for he loved mother, and if she  hadn't died when he was scarcely more than a boy, things might have been  different.... The reason I opened the bedroom door--something I never do  when the babies are asleep--was because I needed a sight of their faces to  reconcile me to my duty and take the resentment out of my heart ... and it  did flow out, Reba,--out into the stillness. It is so dazzling white  outside, I couldn't bear my heart to be shrouded in gloom!\"    \"Poor Letty!\" And Mrs. Larrabee furtively wiped away a tear. \"How long  since you have heard? I didn't dare ask.\"    \"Not a word, not a line for nearly three months, and for the half-year  before that it was nothing but a note, sometimes with a five-dollar  bill enclosed. David seems to think it the natural thing for me to  look after his children; as if there could be no question of any life  of my own.\"    \"You began wrong, Letty. You were born a prop and you've been propping  somebody ever since.\"    \"I've done nothing but my plain duty. When my mother died there was my  stepfather to nurse, but I was young and strong; I didn't mind; and he  wasn't a burden long, poor father. Then, after four years came the  shock of David's reckless marriage. When he asked if he might bring  that girl here until her time of trial was over, it seemed to me I  could never endure it! But there were only two of us left, David and  I; I thought of mother and said yes.\"    \"I remember, Letty; I had come to Beulah then.\"    \"Yes, and you know what Eva was. How David, how anybody, could have  loved her, I cannot think! Well, he brought her, and you know how it  turned out. David never saw her alive again, nor ever saw his babies  after they were three days old. "]]]
