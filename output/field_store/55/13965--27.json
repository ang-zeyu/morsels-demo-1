The compradore looked at me  searchingly. \"What pidgin belong you?\" he asked--meaning what is your  business? Humbly I answered, \"My belong Jesus Christ pidgin\"; that is, I  am a missionary, to which he instantly and with some scorn replied, \"No  dam fear!\"    We called at the river ports and reached Hankow on the 14th. Hankow, the  Chinese say, is the mart of eight provinces and the centre of the earth.  It is the chief distributing centre of the Yangtse valley, the capital  city of the centre of China. The trade in tea, its staple export, is  declining rapidly, particularly since 1886. Indian opium goes no higher  up the river than this point; its importation into Hankow is now  insignificant, amounting to only 738 piculs (44 tons) per annum. Hankow  is on the left bank of the Yangtse, separated only by the width of the  Han river from Hanyang, and by the width of the Yangtse from Wuchang;  these three divisions really form one large city, with more inhabitants  than the entire population of the colony of Victoria.    Wuchang is the capital city of the two provinces of Hunan and Hupeh; it  is here that the Viceroy, Chang Chi Tung, resides in his official yamen  and dispenses injustice from a building almost as handsome as the  American mission-houses which overlook it. Chang Chi Tung is the most  anti-foreign of all the Viceroys of China; yet no Viceroy in the Empire  has ever had so many foreigners in his employ as he. \"Within the four  seas,\" he says, \"all men are brothers\"; yet the two provinces he rules  over are closed against foreigners, and the missionaries are compelled  to remain under the shelter of the foreign Concession in Hankow. With a  public spirit unusual among Chinese Viceroys he has devoted the immense  revenues of his office to the modern development of the resources of his  vice-kingdom. He has erected a gigantic cotton-mill at Wuchang with  thirty-five thousand spindles, covering six acres and lit with the  electric light, and with a reservoir of three acres and a half. He has  built a large mint. At Hanyang he has erected magnificent iron-works and  blast furnaces which cover many acres and are provided with all the  latest machinery. He has iron and coal mines, with a railway seventeen  miles long from the mines to the river, and specially constructed  river-steamers and special hoisting machinery at the river-banks. Money  he has poured out like water; he is probably the only important official  in China who will leave office a poor man.    Acting as private secretary to the Viceroy is a clever Chinese named Kaw  Hong Beng, the author of _Defensio Populi_, that often-quoted attack  upon missionary methods which appeared first in _The North China Daily  News_. A linguist of unusual ability, who publishes in _The Daily News_  translations from Heine in English verse, Kaw is gifted with a rare  command over the resources of English. He is a Master of Arts of the  University of Edinburgh. Yet, strange paradox, notwithstanding that he  had the privilege of being trained in the most pious and earnest  community in the United Kingdom, under the lights of the United  Presbyterian Kirk, Free Kirk, Episcopalian Church, and _The_ Kirk, not  to mention a large and varied assortment of Dissenting Churches of more  or less dubious orthodoxy, he is openly hostile to the introduction of  Christianity into China. And nowhere in China is the opposition to the  introduction of Christianity more intense than in the Yangtse valley. In  this intensity many thoughtful missionaries see the greater hope of the  ultimate conversion of this portion of China; opposition they say is a  better aid to missionary success than mere apathy.    During the time I was in China, I met large numbers of missionaries of  all classes, in many cities from Peking to Canton, and they unanimously  expressed satisfaction at the progress they are making in China.  Expressed succinctly, their harvest may be described as amounting to a  fraction more than two Chinamen per missionary per annum. If, however,  the paid ordained and unordained native helpers be added to the number  of missionaries, you find that the aggregate body converts nine-tenths  of a Chinaman per worker per annum; but the missionaries deprecate their  work being judged by statistics. There are 1511 Protestant missionaries  labouring in the Empire; and, estimating their results from the  statistics of previous years as published in the _Chinese Recorder_, we  find that they gathered last year (1893) into the fold 3127 Chinese--not  all of whom it is feared are genuine Christians--at a cost of _L350,000_,  a sum equal to the combined incomes of the ten chief London hospitals.    Hankow itself swarms with missionaries, \"who are unhappily divided into  so many sects, that even a foreigner is bewildered by their number, let  alone the heathen to whom they are accredited.\" (Medhurst.)    Dwelling in well-deserved comfort in and around the foreign settlement,  there are members of the London Missionary Society, of the Tract  Society, of the Local Tract Society, of the British and Foreign Bible  Society, of the National Bible Society of Scotland, of the American  Bible Society; there are Quaker missionaries, Baptist, Wesleyan, and  Independent missionaries of private means; there are members of the  Church Missionary Society, of the American Board of Missions, and of the  American High Church Episcopal Mission; there is a Medical Mission in  connection with the London Missionary Society, there is a flourishing  French Mission under a bishop, the \"_Missions etrangeres de Paris_,\" a  Mission of Franciscan Fathers, most of whom are Italian, and a Spanish  Mission of the Order of St. Augustine.    The China Inland Mission has its chief central distributing station at  Hankow, and here also are the headquarters of a Scandinavian Mission, of  a Danish Mission, and of an unattached mission, most of the members of  which are also Danish. Where there are so many missions, of so many  different sects, and holding such widely divergent views, it is, I  suppose, inevitable that each mission should look with some disfavour  upon the work done by its neighbours, should have some doubts as to the  expediency of their methods, and some reasonable misgivings as to the  genuineness of their conversions.    The Chinese \"Rice Christians,\" those spurious Christians who become  converted in return for being provided with rice, are just those who  profit by these differences of opinion, and who, with timely lapses from  grace, are said to succeed in being converted in turn by all the  missions from the Augustins to the Quakers.    Every visitor to Hankow and to all other open ports, who is a supporter  of missionary effort, is pleased to find that his preconceived notions  as to the hardships and discomforts of the open port missionary in China  are entirely false. Comfort and pleasures of life are there as great as  in any other country. Among the most comfortable residences in Hankow  are the quarters of the missionaries; and it is but right that the  missionaries should be separated as far as possible from all  discomfort--missionaries who are sacrificing all for China, and who are  prepared to undergo any reasonable hardship to bring enlightenment to  this land of darkness.    I called at the headquarters of the Spanish mission of Padres Agustinos  and smoked a cigarette with two of the Padres, and exchanged  reminiscences of Valladolid and Barcelona. And I can well conceive,  having seen the extreme dirtiness of the mission premises, how little  the Spaniard has to alter his ways in order to make them conform to the  more ancient civilisation of the Chinese.    In Hankow there is a large foreign concession with a handsome embankment  lined by large buildings. There is a rise and fall in the river between  summer and winter levels of nearly sixty feet. In the summer the river  laps the edge of the embankment and may overflow into the concession; in  the winter, broad steps lead down to the edge of the water which, even  when shrunk into its bed, is still more than half a mile in width. Our  handsome consulate is at one end of the embankment; at the other there  is a remarkable municipal building which was designed by a former City  constable, who was, I hope, more expert with the handcuffs than he was  with the pencil.    [Illustration: THE AUTHOR'S CHINESE PASSPORT.]    Our interests in Hankow are protected by Mr. Pelham Warren, the Consul,  one of the ablest men in the Service. I registered at the Consulate as a  British subject and obtained a Chinese passport in terms of the Treaty  of Tientsin for the four provinces Hupeh, Szechuen, Kweichow, and  Yunnan, available for one year from the date of issue.    I had no servant. An English-speaking \"boy,\" hearing that I was in need  of one, came to me to recommend \"his number one flend,\" who, he assured  me, spoke English \"all the same Englishman.\" But when the \"flend\" came I  found that he spoke English all the same as I spoke Chinese. He was not  abashed, but turned away wrath by saying to me, through an interpreter,  \"It is true that I cannot speak the foreign language, but the foreign  gentleman is so clever that in one month he will speak Chinese  beautifully.\" We did not come to terms.    At Hankow I embarked on the China Merchants' steamer _Kweili_, the only  triple-screw steamer on the River, and four days later, on February  21st, I landed at Ichang, the most inland port on the Yangtse yet  reached by steam. Ichang is an open port; it is the scene of the  anti-foreign riot of September 2nd, 1891, when the foreign settlement  was pillaged and burnt by the mob, aided by soldiers of the Chentai  Loh-Ta-Jen, the head military official in charge at Ichang, \"who gave  the outbreak the benefit of his connivance.\" Pleasant zest is given to  life"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19180"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XXIV., No. 12,  March 18, 1871 (#2)"],[1,"on, bring the  weight to bear upon the bar. By this means, small weights up to 7lb.  could be put on while hanging, but when these had to be taken off and  a large weight put on, the scale was lowered to the rest, and again  raised after the change was made. I may here state that a curious  circumstance occurred twice, which seems to indicate that mere raising  of the weight, without the slightest apparent vibration, was equal in  effect to an additional weight. 33/4 cwts. were on the scale, a 14lb.  weight was added, then 7lb., then 4lb., 2lb., 1lb., and 1lb., making  4cwts. and 1lb. This was allowed to act for from one to two minutes,  and then lowered to take off the small weights, which were replaced by  a 56lb. with the intention of adding small weights when suspended; the  whole was then raised so imperceptibly by the screw, that the only way  of ascertaining that it was suspended, was by looking under the scale  to see that it was clear of the rest. As soon as it was half-an-inch  clear it snapped, thus breaking at once with one pound less than it  resisted for nearly two minutes.    \"Six experiments were carefully conducted at 60 deg. F., the parts of the  bars being selected so as to give to each set of experiments similar  portions of both bars; the results are marked on the pieces. My  assistant now prepared a refrigerating mixture which stood at zero,  the bars were immersed for some time in this, and we prepared for the  breaking trials to be made as quickly as could be, consistently with  accuracy; and to secure the low temperature, each bar, on being placed  in the machine, had its surface at top covered with the freezing  mixture. The bars at zero broke with more regularity than at 60 deg., but  instead of the results confirming the general impression as to cold  rendering iron more brittle, they are calculated to substantiate  an exactly opposite idea, namely, that reduction of temperature,  _caeteris paribus_, increases the strength of cast iron. The only  doubtful experiment of the whole twelve is the first, and as it stands  much the highest, the probability is that it should be lower; yet,  even taking it as it stands, the average of the six experiments at  60 deg. F., gives 4cwt. 4lb. as the breaking weight of the bar at that  temperature, while the average of the six experiments at zero gives  4cwt 20lb. as the breaking weight of the bar at zero, being an  increase of strength, from the reduction of temperature, equal to 3.5  per cent.\"    Sir W. Fairbairn states: \"It has been asserted, in evidence given at  the coroner's inquest, in a recent railway accident, that the breaking  of the steel tire was occasioned by the intensity of the frost, which  is supposed to have rendered the metal, of which this particular  tire was composed, brittle. This is the opinion of most persons, but  judging from my own experience such is not the fact. Some years since  I endeavored to settle this question by a long and careful series  of experiments on wrought iron, from which it was proved that the  resistance to a tensile chain was as great at the temperature of zero  as it was at 60 deg. or upwards, until it attained a scarcely visible red  heat.\"    The immense number of purposes to which both iron and steel are  applied, and the changes of temperature to which they are exposed,  renders the inquiry not only interesting in a scientific point of  view, but absolutely necessary to a knowledge of their security under  the various influences of those changes. It was for these reasons  that the experiments in question were undertaken, and the summary of  results is sufficiently conclusive to show that changes of temperature  are not always the cause of failure. Sir W. Fairbairn adds: \"The  danger arising from broken tires does not, according to my opinion,  arise so much from changes of temperature as from the practice of  heating them to a dull red heat, and shrinking them on to the rim of  the wheels. This, I believe, is the general practice, and the unequal,  and in some cases, the severe strains to which they are subject, has a  direct tendency to break the tires.\"           *       *       *       *       *          OAK GRAINING IN OIL COLORS.    CONDENSED FROM THE BUILDING NEWS.      There is a charm and feeling about work executed by the hand, which  gives it a value no mere machine work can possess. Machine work, from  its very nature, necessitates a repetition of pattern, which cannot  be avoided. Hand-work, on the contrary, can imitate every variety, and  follow nature so closely that no two pieces need be alike. There  is also in hand-work a wide scope for the inventive faculty and  the exercise of good taste (both in form and color) and skillful  workmanship. As a rule, strong contrasts between the ground and the  graining color should be avoided. The figure and grain should of  course be seen clearly, but only so clearly as to be distinct, without  interfering with the general and uniform quietness of tone necessary  to fulfil the conditions required by the laws of harmony and good  taste. Violent contrasts and gaudy coloring are always vulgar,  brilliancy and richness of color are not necessarily vulgar; it is  the absence of the guiding power of knowledge and pure taste in their  arrangement which degrades them to the rank of vulgarity. We have  before spoken of the importance of good combing, and of the various  kinds of combs used; we now proceed to describe how the work is done.  The graining color is brushed over the work, in the ordinary manner,  with a pound-brush, care being taken not to put too much color on,  or else it is very liable to be dirty. A dry duster is now used to  stipple with, which, if properly done, will distribute the color  evenly; it is now ready for combing. In the real oak it will be found,  as a rule, that the grain is invariably coarser on one side of the  panel than on the other; this arises from the very nature of the  growth of the tree; it is, therefore, well to imitate this  pattern, and in order to do so we take first a medium or coarse cut  gutta-percha comb, and draw it down one side of the panel; then use a  finer one to complete it. This comb will leave the marks of the grain  in clear unbroken lines from top to bottom of the panel. We now take a  fine steel comb and go over the whole of the previous combing, moving  it in a slanting or diagonal direction across the previous grain, or  with a quick and short wavy motion or curl; both the former and the  latter motion will break up the long lines, left by the gutta-percha  comb, into short bits, which of course represent the pores or grains  of the real wood. There are several other motions of the comb having  the same end in view; and by using the gutta-percha or cork combs, in  conjunction with the fine steel, an infinite variety of grain may be  produced. Steel combs, with one or more folds of thin rag placed  over the ends of the teeth are a style of comb which has nothing to  recommend it. A natural variation in the grain may be produced by one  comb alone, according to the manner in which it is held. For instance,  if we take a coarse or broad-toothed gutta-percha comb, and commence  at the top of a panel, with the comb, placed at its full width: if  drawn down in this position it will leave a grain of the same width  as the width of the teeth: but if we start with the full width, and  gradually turn the comb or slightly incline it to one side--that is to  say, on its edge, we thereby graduate the grain from coarse to fine  at pleasure, and by holding the comb at a certain inclination we may  actually make very fine the coarse comb. A very important point is  the formation of the joints in the wood, as much of the effect of  otherwise good work is lost in consequence of neglect in this respect.  In looking at a real oak door, the joints of the stiles and rails are  clearly and sharply defined, not by any defect of workmanship, but  by the difference in the run of the grain, the stiles being  perpendicular, and the rails horizontal. The rails being cut sharp  off by the stiles, show a perfectly straight line. The light also acts  differently upon the two, simply because the grain or fibre of the  wood is exposed to its influence under different aspects. This also  tends to produce a difference in the depth of the color of rails and  stiles, and panels also. It will be evident that no imitations can be  considered really good except they include these seemingly unimportant  points.    It is a common practice for grainers to imitate a broad piece of heart  or sap of oak, upon the back rail of almost every door they do, and  many of them are not even content with that, but daub the stiles over  from top to bottom with it also. There is nothing so vulgar or in  such bad taste. It should only be done upon those parts of the work on  which it would appear on a real oak door, namely, on the edges of the  doors and on mouldings. There is a vulgar pretentiousness about what  we may call the sappy style of work which is very undesirable. The  figures cross the grain more or less abruptly and of course are of  different shapes, sizes, and forms, a knowledge of which can only be  acquired by study of the real wood. The figure may be wiped out with  a piece of soft rag, held tight over the thumb nail. This should have  two or three folds over the nail, the superfluous rag being held by  the other hand to prevent it hanging down and smearing the grain; and  every time a figure is wiped, the rag should be moved slightly, so  that the same part of the rag will not be used twice, thus insuring  clean work. It will often happen that the thumb-nail will get broken,  or is too weak to stand the work; in these cases, or, in fact, in  any case, a good substitute or artificial thumb-nail may be made of  gutta-percha, thus: A piece of thin sheet gutta-percha is put into  warm water, and, while soft, is wrapped around"]]]
