Private telegrams had long been stopped,  but an official thought he might be able to get mine through, so I sent  a long one asking that the nurses might not be sent till further notice.  As a matter of fact it never arrived, and the next afternoon I heard  that twenty-six nurses--instead of sixteen as was originally  arranged--were already on their way. There were 15,000 beds in Brussels  prepared for the reception of the wounded, and though there were not  many wounded in the city just then, the nurses would certainly all be  wanted soon if any of the rumours were true that we heard on all sides,  of heavy fighting in the neighbourhood, and severe losses inflicted on  the gallant little Belgian Army.    It was impossible to arrange for the nurses to go straight to their work  on arrival, so it was decided that they should go to a hotel for one  night and be drafted to their various posts the next day. Anyhow, they  could not arrive till the evening, so in the afternoon I went out to the  barriers to see what resistance had been made against the possible  German occupation of Brussels. It did not look very formidable--some  barbed-wire entanglements, a great many stones lying about, and the  Gardes Civiles in their quaint old-fashioned costume guarding various  points. That was all.    In due time my large family arrived and were installed at the hotel.  Then we heard, officially, that the Germans were quite near the city,  and that probably the train the nurses had come by would be the last to  get through, and this proved to be the case. _Affiches_ were pasted  everywhere on the walls with the Burgomaster's message to his people:         A SAD HOUR! THE GERMANS ARE AT OUR GATES!         PROCLAMATION OF THE BURGOMASTER OF BRUSSELS         CITIZENS,--In spite of the heroic resistance of our       troops, seconded by the Allied Armies, it is to be feared that the       enemy may invade Brussels.         If this eventuality should take place, I hope that I may be able to       count on the calmness and steadiness of the population.         Let every one keep himself free from terror--free from panic.         The Communal Authorities will not desert their posts. They will       continue to exercise their functions with that firmness of purpose       that you have the right to demand from them under such grave       circumstances.         I need hardly remind my fellow-citizens of their duty to their       country. The laws of war forbid the enemy to force the population       to give information as to the National Army and its method of       defence. The inhabitants of Brussels must know that they are within       their rights in refusing to give any information on this point to       the invader. This refusal is their duty in the interests of their       country.         Let none of you act as a guide to the enemy.         Let every one take precautions against spies and foreign agents,       who will try to gather information or provoke manifestations.         The enemy cannot legitimately harm the family honour nor the life       of the citizens, nor their private property, nor their philosophic       or religious convictions, nor interfere with their religious       services.         Any abuse committed by the invader must be immediately reported to       me.         As long as I have life and liberty, I shall protect with all my       might the dignity and rights of my fellow-citizens. I beg the       inhabitants to facilitate my task by abstaining from all acts of       hostility, all employment of arms, and by refraining from       intervention in battles or encounters.         Citizens, whatever happens, listen to the voice of your Burgomaster       and maintain your confidence in him; he will not betray it.         Long live Belgium free and independent!         Long live Brussels!         ADOLPHE MAX.    All that night refugees from Louvain and Termonde poured in a steady  stream into Brussels, seeking safety. I have never seen a more pitiful  sight. Little groups of terror-stricken peasants fleeing from their  homes, some on foot, some more fortunate ones with their bits of  furniture in a rough cart drawn by a skeleton horse or a large dog. All  had babies, aged parents, or invalids with them. I realized then for the  first time what war meant. We do not know in England. God grant we never  may. It was not merely rival armies fighting battles, it was  civilians--men, women, and children--losing their homes, their  possessions, their country, even their lives. This invasion of  unfortunates seemed to wake Brussels up to the fact that the German army  was indeed at her gate. Hordes of people rushed to the Gare du Nord in  the early dawn to find it entirely closed, no trains either entering or  leaving it. It was said that as much rolling-stock as was possible had  been sent to France to prevent it being taken by the Germans. There was  then a stampede to the Gare du Midi, from whence a few trains were still  leaving the city crammed to their utmost capacity.    In the middle of the morning I got a telephone message from the Belgian  Red Cross that the Germans were at the barriers, and would probably  occupy Brussels in half an hour, and that all my nurses must be in their  respective posts before that time.    Oh dear, what a stampede it was. I told the nurses they must leave their  luggage for the present and be ready in five minutes, and in less than  that time we left the hotel, looking more like a set of rag-and-bone men  than respectable British nursing sisters. One had seized a large  portmanteau, another a bundle of clean aprons, another soap and toilet  articles; yet another provident soul had a tea-basket. I am glad that  the funny side of it did not strike me then, but in the middle of the  next night I had helpless hysterics at the thought of the spectacle we  must have presented. Mercifully no one took much notice of us--the  streets were crowded and we had difficulty in getting on in some  places--just at one corner there was a little cheer and a cry of \"Vive  les Anglais!\"    It took a long time before my flock was entirely disposed of. It had  been arranged that several of them should work at one of the large  hospitals in Brussels where 150 beds had been set apart for the wounded,  five in another hospital at the end of the city, two in an ambulance  station in the centre of Brussels, nine were taken over to a large  fire-station that was converted into a temporary hospital with 130 beds,  and two had been promised for a private hospital outside the barriers.  It was a work of time to get the last two to their destinations; the  Germans had begun to come in by that time, and we had to wait two hours  to cross a certain street that led to the hospital, as all traffic had  been stopped while the enemy entered Brussels.    It was an imposing sight to watch the German troops ride in. The  citizens of Brussels behaved magnificently, but what a bitter  humiliation for them to undergo. How should we have borne it, I wonder,  if it had been London? The streets were crowded, but there was hardly a  sound to be heard, and the Germans took possession of Brussels in  silence. First the Uhlans rode in, then other cavalry, then the  artillery and infantry. The latter were dog-weary, dusty and  travel-stained--they had evidently done some forced marching. When the  order was given to halt for a few minutes, many of them lay down in the  street just as they were, resting against their packs, some too  exhausted to eat, others eating sausages out of little paper bags  (which, curiously enough, bore the name of a Dutch shop printed on the  outside) washed down with draughts of beer which many of the inhabitants  of Brussels, out of pity for their weary state, brought them from the  little drinking-houses that line the Chaussee du Nord.    The rear was brought up by Red Cross wagons and forage carts,  commissariat wagons, and all the miscellaneous kit of an army on the  march. It took thirty-six hours altogether for the army to march in and  take possession. They installed themselves in the Palais de Justice and  the Hotel de Ville, having requisitioned beds, food and everything that  they wanted from the various hotels. Poor Madame of the Hotel X. wept  and wrung her hands over the loss of her beautiful beds. Alas, poor  Madame! The next day her husband was shot as a spy, and she cared no  longer about the beds.    In the meantime, just as it got dark, I installed my last two nurses in  the little ambulance out beyond the barriers.          II    CHARLEROI AND ROUND ABOUT      The Germans had asked for three days to pass through the city of  Brussels; a week had passed and they showed no signs of going. The first  few days more and more German soldiers poured in--dirty, footsore, and  for the most part utterly worn out. At first the people of Brussels  treated them with almost unnecessary kindness--buying them cake and  chocolate, treating them to beer, and inviting them into their houses to  rest--but by the end of the week these civilities ceased.    Tales of the German atrocities began to creep in--stories of Liege and  Louvain were circulated from mouth to mouth, and doubtless lost nothing  by being repeated.    [Illustration: MAP OF BELGIUM]    There was no _real_ news at all. Think how cut off we were--certainly it  was nothing in comparison with what it was afterwards--but we could  not know that then--and anyway we learnt to accommodate ourselves to the  lack of news by degrees. Imagine a Continental capital suddenly without  newspapers, without trains, telephones, telegraphs; all that we had  considered up to now essentials of civilized life. Personally, I heard a  good deal of Belgian news, one way and another, as I visited all my  flock each day in their various hospitals and ambulances stationed "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17594"],[0,"Lectures on Language, as Particularly Connected with English Grammar.

Study of Language long considered difficult.--Its importance.--Errors      in teaching.--Not understood by Teachers.--Attachment to old      systems.--Improvement preferable.--The subject important.--Its      advantages.--Principles laid down.--Orthography.--Etymology.--      Syntax.--Prosody.      LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,    It is proposed to commence, this evening, a course of Lectures on the  Grammar of the English Language. I am aware of the difficulties  attending this subject, occasioned not so much by any fault in itself,  as by the thousand and one methods adopted to teach it, the multiplicity  of books pretending to \"simplify\" it, and the vast contrariety of  opinion entertained by those who profess to be its masters. By many it  has been considered a needless affair, an unnecessary appendage to a  common education; by others, altogether beyond the reach of common  capacities; and by all, cold, lifeless, and uninteresting, full of  doubts and perplexities, where the wisest have differed, and the firmest  often changed opinions.    All this difficulty originates, I apprehend, in the wrong view that is  taken of the subject. The most beautiful landscape may appear at great  disadvantage, if viewed from an unfavorable position. I would be slow to  believe that the means on which depends the whole business of the  community, the study of the sciences, all improvement upon the past, the  history of all nations in all ages of the world, social intercourse,  oral or written, and, in a great measure, the knowledge of God, and the  hopes of immortality, can be either unworthy of study, or, if rightly  explained, uninteresting in the acquisition. In fact, on the principles  I am about to advocate, I have seen the deepest interest manifested,  from the small child to the grey-headed sire, from the mere novice to  the statesman and philosopher, and all alike seemed to be edified and  improved by the attention bestowed upon the subject.    I confess, however, that with the mention of _grammar_, an association  of ideas are called up by no means agreeable. The mind involuntarily  reverts to the days of childhood, when we were compelled, at the risk of  our bodily safety, to commit to memory a set of arbitrary rules, which  we could neither understand nor apply in the correct use of language.  Formerly it was never dreamed that grammar depended on any higher  authority than the books put into our hands. And learners were not only  dissuaded, but strictly forbidden to go beyond the limits set them in  the etymological and syntactical rules of the authors to whom they were  referred. If a query ever arose in their minds, and they modestly  proposed a plain question as to the _why_ and _wherefore_ things were  thus, instead of giving an answer according to common sense, in a way to  be understood, the authorities were pondered over, till some rule or  remark could be found which would apply, and this settled the matter  with \"proof as strong as holy writ.\" In this way an end may be put to  the inquiry; but the thinking mind will hardly be satisfied with the  mere opinion of another, who has no evidence to afford, save the  undisputed dignity of his station, or the authority of books. This  course is easily accounted for. Rather than expose his own ignorance,  the teacher quotes the printed ignorance of others, thinking, no doubt,  that folly and nonsense will appear better second-handed, than fresh  from his own responsibility. Or else on the more common score, that  \"misery loves company.\"    Teachers have not unfrequently found themselves placed in an unenviable  position by the honest inquiries of some thinking urchin, who has  demanded why \"_one noun governs_ another in the possessive case,\" as  \"master's slave;\" why there are more tenses than _three_; what is meant  by a _neuter_ verb, which \"signifies neither action nor passion;\" or an  \"intransitive verb,\" which expresses the highest possible action, but  terminates on no object; a cause without an effect; why _that_ is"]]]
