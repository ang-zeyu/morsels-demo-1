Pish. They are all alike.      NATHANAEL.    Then your mistress is such a treasure  That you despise so much our own?      HOFFMANN.    My mistress, no, no, say rather three  Charming trio of enchantresses.  Who are dividing my days.  Would you like the story of my crazy loves?...      CHORUS.      Yes, yes!      NICKLAUSSE.      What are you saying of three mistresses?      HOFFMANN.      Smoke!...  Before this dead pipe is relighted  You will have comprehended,  You who in this play where my heart was consumed  In good sense took the first prize!    (All the students go to their places.)      CHORUS.    Listen. It is nice to drink,  To the telling of a crazy tale,  While following the fragrant cloud,  That a pipe throws in the air.      HOFFMANN (sitting on corner of table).      I begin.      CHORUS.      Silence.      HOFFMANN.      The name of the first was Olympia...    (The curtain falls as Hoffmann is speaking.)          ACT II.      (A physicians room, richly furnished.)      HOFFMAN (alone).    Come! Courage and confidence;  I become a well of science.  I must turn with the wind that blows,  To deserve the one I love.  I shall know how to find in myself  The stuff of a learned man.  She is there... if I dared.    (He softly lifts the portiere.)      'Tis she!  She sleeps... how beautiful!  Ah! together live... both in the same hope,  The same remembrance  Divide our happiness and our sorrow,  And share the future.  Let, let my flame  Pour in thee the light,  Let your soul but open  To the rays of Love.  Divine hearth! Sun whose ardor penetrates  And comes to kiss us.  Ineffable desire where one's whole being  Melts in a single kiss.  Let, let my flame,    etc., etc.      (Nicklausse appears.)      NICKLAUSSE.      By Jove, I felt sure you'd be here.      HOFFMAN (letting portiere fall).      Chut.      NICKLAUSSE.    Why? 'tis there that breathes  The dove who's now your amorous care,  The beautiful Olympia? Go, my child, admire!      HOFFMAN.      Yes, I adore her!      NICKLAUSSE.      Want to know her better.      HOFFMAN.      The soul one loves is easy to know.      NICKLAUSSE.      What? by a look... through a window?      HOFFMAN.      A look is enough to embrace the heavens.      NICKLAUSSE.      What warmth!... At least she knows that you love her.      HOFFMAN.      No.      NICKLAUSSE.      Write her.      HOFFMAN.      I don't dare.      NICKLAUSSE.      Poor lamb! Speak to her.      HOFFMAN.      The dangers are the same.      NICKLAUSSE.      Then sing, to get out of the scrape.      HOFFMAN.      Monsieur Spalanzani doesn't like music.      NICKLAUSSE (laughing).      Yes, I know, all for physics!  A doll with china eyes  Played cleverly with a fan,  Nearby a little cock in brass;  Both sang in unison  In a marvelous way,  Danced, gossiped, seemed to live.      HOFFMAN.      Beg your pardon. Why this song?      NICKLAUSSE.    The little cock shining and smart,  With a very knowing air,  Three times on himself turned;  By some ingenious wheels,  The doll in rolling its eyes  Sighed and said: \"I love you.\"      CHORUS OF THE INVITED GUESTS.    No, no host, really,  Receives more richly  Through good taste his house shines;  Everything here matches.  No, no host really  Receives more richly.      SPALANZANI.      You will be satisfied, gentlemen, in a moment.    (He makes sign to Cochenille to follow him and exits with him.)      NICKLAUSSE (to Hoffman).      At last we shall more nearly see this marvel  Without equal!      HOFFMAN.      Silence... she is here!    (Enter Spalanzani conducting Olympia.)      SPALANZANI.    Ladies and gentlemen,  I present to you  My daughter Olympia.      THE CHORUS.        Charming.  She has beautiful eyes!  Her shape is very good!  See how well apparelled!  Nothing is wanting!  She does very well!      HOFFMAN.      Ah, how adorable she is!      NICKLAUSSE.      Charming, incomparable!      SPALANZANI (to Olympia).      What a success is thine!      NICKLAUSSE (taking her all in).      Really she does very well.      THE CHORUS.    She has beautiful eyes,  Her shape is very good,  See how well apparelled,  Nothing is really wanting;  She does very well.      SPALANZANI.    Ladies and gentlemen, proud of your applause,  And above all anxious  To conquer more,  My daughter obedient to your least caprice  Will, if you please...      NICKLAUSSE (aside).      Pass to other exercises.      SPALANZANI.    Sing to a grand air, following with the voice,        Rare talent  The clavichord, the guitar,  Or the harp, at your choice!      COCHENILLE (at the rear).    The harp!      BASS VOICE (in the wings).    The harp!      SPALANZANI.    Very good, Cochenille!  Go quickly and bring my daughter's harp!    (Cochenille exits).      HOFFMAN (aside).      I shall hear her... oh joy!      NICKLAUSSE (aside).      Oh, crazy passion!      SPALANZANI (to Olympia).      Master your emotion, my child!      OLYMPIA.      Yes.      COCHENILLE (bringing the harp).      There!      SPALANZANI (sitting beside Olympia).      Gentlemen, attention!      COCHENILLE.      Attention!      THE CHORUS.      Attention!      OLYMPIA (accompanied by Spalanzani).      The birds in the bushes.  In the heavens the orb of day,  All speaks to the young girl  Of love, of love!    There!  The pretty song,    There!  The song of Olympia,    Ha!      THE CHORUS.      'Tis the song of Olympia!      OLYMPIA.    All that sings and resounds  Has its sighs in turn,  Moves its heart that trembles    With love.    There.  The little song,    There, there,    The song of Olympia,      Ha!      CHORUS.      'Tis the song of Olympia.      HOFFMAN (to Nicklausse).      Ah, my friend, what an accent.      NICKLAUSSE.      What runs!    (Cochenille has taken the harp and all surround Olympia. A servant    speaks to Spalanzani).    Come gentlemen! your arm to the ladies.  Supper awaits you!      THE CHORUS.      Supper! That's good...      SPALANZANI.    Unless you would prefer  To dance first.      THE CHORUS (with energy).    No! no! the supper... good thing...  After we'll dance.      SPALANZANI.      As you please...      HOFFMAN (approaching Olympia).      Might I dare...      SPALANZANI (interrupting).    She is a bit tired,  Wait for the ball.    (He touches Olympia's shoulder.)      OLYMPIA.      Yes.      SPALANZANI.    You see. Until then  Will you do me the favor  To keep company with my Olympia?      HOFFMAN.      Oh happiness!      SPALANZANI (aside, laughing).      We'll see what kind a story he'll give her.      NICKLAUSSE (to Spalanzani).      Won't she take supper?      SPALANZANI.      No.      NICKLAUSSE (aside).      Poetic soul!    (Spalanzani goes behind Olympia. Noise of a spring is heard. Nicklausse    turns around.)      What did you say?      SPALANZANI.      Nothing, physics! ah, monsieur, physics!    (He conducts Olympia to a chair. Goes out with guests).      COCHENILLE.      The supper awaits you.      THE CHORUS.    Supper, supper, supper awaits us!  No, really, no host  Receives more richly!    (They go out.)      HOFFMAN.    They are at last gone. Ah, I breathe!  Alone, alone, the two of us (approaching Olympia);  I have so many things to say,  Oh my Olympia! Let me admire you!  With your charming looks let me intoxicate myself.    (He touches her shoulder).      OLYMPIA.      Yes.      HOFFMAN.    Is it not a dream born of fever?  I thought I heard a sigh escape your lips!    (He again touches her shoulder).      OLYMPIA.      Yes.      HOFFMAN.    Sweet avowal, pledge of our love,  You are mine, our hearts are united forever!  Ah! understand you, tell me, this eternal joy  Of silent hearts.  Living, with but one soul and with same stroke of wing,  Rush up to heaven!  Let, let, my flame  Show you the light of day!  Let your soul open  To the rays of love.    (He presses Olympia's hand. She rises and walks up and down, then    exits.)    You escape me?... What have I done.    You do not answer?...  Speak! Have I wounded you? Ah!    I'll follow your steps!    (As Hoffmann is about to rush out Nicklausse appears.)      NICKLAUSSE.    Here, by Jove, moderate your zeal!  Do you want us to drink without you?...      HOFFMAN (half crazy).      Nicklausse, I am beloved by her.    Loved! By all the gods.      NICKLAUSSE.    By my faith  If you knew what they are saying of your beauty!      HOFFMAN.      What can they say? What?      NICKLAUSSE.      That she is dead.      HOFFMAN.      Great Heavens!      NICKLAUSSE.      Or is not of this life.      HOFFMAN (exalted).      Nicklausse! I am beloved by her!    Loved! By all the gods.      COPPÃ‰LIUS (entering, furious).    Thief! brigand! what a tumble!  Elias is bankrupt!  But I shall find the opportunity  To revenge myself... Robbed!... Me!    I'll kill somebody.    (Coppelius slips into Olympia's room.)    (Everybody enters.)      SPALANZANI.      Here come the waltzers.      COCHENILLE.      Here comes the round dance.      HOFFMAN.      'Tis the waltz that calls us.      SPALANZANI (to Olympia).      Take the hand of the gentleman, my child.    (Touching her shoulder.)      Come.      OLYMPIA.      Yes.    (Hoffman takes Olympia and they waltz. They disappear on left.)      CHORUS.      She dances!    In cadence.    'Tis marvelous,    Prodigious,    Room, room,    She passes    Through the air    Like lightning.      THE VOICE OF HOFFMAN (outside).      Olympia!      SPALANZANI.      Stop them!      THE CHORUS.      Who of us will do it?      NICKLAUSSE.      She will break his head.    (Hoffman and Olympia re-appear. Nicklausse rushes to stop them.)      A thousand devils!

Hoffman,    exhausted, falls on a sofa).      There!

The Greek inscription on a marble slab,  dating back to 80-81 B.C.E., preserved in the Imperial Hermitage in St.  Petersburg, makes it certain that they flourished in the Crimea before  the destruction of the Temple. In a communication to the Russian  Geographical Society, M. Pogodin makes the statement, that there still  exist a synagogue and a cemetery in the Crimea that belong to the  pre-Christian era. Some of the tombstones, bearing Jewish names, and  decorated with the seven-branched Menorah, date back to 157 B.C.E.;  while Chufut-Kale, also known as the Rock of the Jews (Sela'  ha-Yehudim), from the fortress supposed to have been built there by the  Jews, would prove Jewish settlements to have been made there during the  Babylonian or Persian captivity.[3]    Though the same antiquity cannot be established for other Jewish  settlements, we know that Kiev, \"the mother of Russian cities,\" had many  Jews long before the eighth century, who thus antedated the Russians as  citizens. According to Joseph Hakohen they came there from Persia in  690, according to Malishevsky in 776. It is certain that their influence  was felt as early as the latter part of the tenth century. The Russian  Chronicles ascribed to Nestor relate that they endeavored, in 986, to  induce Grand Duke Vladimir to accept their religion. They did not  succeed as they had succeeded two centuries before with the khan of the  Khazars.[4] Yet the grand duke, who had the greatest influence in  introducing and spreading Greek Catholicism, and who is now worshipped  as a saint, was always favorably disposed toward them.    There were other places that were inhabited early by Jews. There are  traditions to the effect that Jews lived in Poland as early as the ninth  century, and under the Boreslavs (992-1278) they are said to have  enjoyed considerable privileges, carried on a lively trade, and spread  as far as Kiev. Chernigov in Little Russia (the Ukraine), Baku in South  Russia (Transcaucasia), Kalisz and Warsaw, Brest and Grodno, in West  Russia (Russian Poland), all possess Jewish communities of considerable  antiquity. In the townlet Eishishki, near Vilna, a tombstone set in 1171  was still in existence at the end of the last century, and Khelm,  Government Kovno, has a synagogue to which tradition ascribes an age of  eight hundred years.[5]    The Jewish population in all these communities was prosperous and  respected. Jews were in favor with the Government, enjoyed equal rights  with their Gentile neighbors, and were especially prominent as traders  and farmers of taxes. Their monoxyla, or one-oared canoes, loaded with  silks, furs, and precious metals, issued from the Borysthanes, traversed  the Baltic and the Euxine, the Oder and the Bosphorus, the Danube and  the Black Sea, and carried on the commerce between the Turks and the  Slavonians. They were granted the honorable and lucrative privilege of  directing and controlling the mints, and that of putting Hebrew as well  as Slavonic inscriptions on their coins.[6] In the Lithuanian Magna  Charta, granted by Vitold in 1388, the Jews of Brest were given many  rights, and about a year later those of Grodno were permitted to engage  in all pursuits and occupations, and exempted from paying taxes on  synagogues and cemeteries. They possessed full jurisdiction in their own  affairs. Some were raised to the nobility, notably the Josephovich  brothers, Abraham and Michael. Under King Alexander Jagellon, Abraham  was assessor of Kovno, alderman of Smolensk, and prefect of Minsk; he  was called \"sir\" (jastrzhembets), was presented with the estates of  Voidung, Grinkov, and Troki (1509), and appointed Secretary of the  Treasury in Lithuania (1510). The other brother, Michael, was made  \"fiscal agent to the king.\" In the eighteenth century, Andrey  Abramovich, of the same family but not of the Jewish faith, was senator  and castellan of Brest-Litovsk.[7] They were not unique exceptions.  Abraham Shmoilovich of Turisk is spoken of as \"honorable sir\" in leases  of large estates. Affras Rachmailovich and Judah Bogdanovich figure  among the merchant princes of Livonia and Lithuania; and Francisco Molo,  who settled later in Amsterdam, was financial agent of John III of  Poland in 1679. The influence of the last-named was so great with the  Dutch States-General that the Treaty of Ryswick was concluded with Louis  XIV, in 1697, through his mediation.[8]    That Russo-Poland should have elected a Jewish king on two occasions, a  certain Abraham Prochovnik in 842 and the famous Saul Wahl[9] in the  sixteenth century, sounds legendary; but that there was a Jewish queen,  called Esterka, is probable, and that some Jews attained to political  eminence is beyond reasonable doubt.[10] Records have been discovered  concerning two envoys, Saul and Joseph, who served the Slavonic czar  about 960, and an interesting story is told of two Jewish soldiers,  Ephraim Moisievich and Anbal the Jassin, who won the confidence of  Prince Andrey Bogolyubsky of Kiev, and afterwards became leaders in a  conspiracy against him (1174).[11] Henry, Duke of Anjou, the successor  of Sigismud August on the throne of Poland and Lithuania, owed his  election mainly to the efforts of Solomon Ashkenazi. Ivan Vassilyevich,  too, had many and important relations with Jews, and his favorable  attitude towards them is amply proved by the fact that his family  physician was the Jew Leo (1490). Throughout his reign he maintained an  uninterrupted friendship with Chozi Kokos, a Jew of the Crimea, and he  did not hesitate to offer hospitality and protection to Zacharias de  Guizolfi, though the latter was not in a position to reciprocate such  favors.[12]    In addition there are less prominent individuals who received honors at  the hands of their non-Jewish countrymen. Meir Ashkenazi of Kaffa, in  the Crimea, who was slain by pirates on a trip from \"Gava to Dakhel,\"  was envoy of the khan of the Tatars to the king of Poland in the  sixteenth century. Mention is made of \"Jewish Cossacks,\" who  distinguished themselves on the field of battle, and were elevated to  the rank of major and colonel.[13] While the common opinion regarding  Jews expressed itself in merry England in such ballads as \"The Jewish  Dochter,\" and \"Gernutus, the Jew of Venice,\" many a Little Russian song  had the bravery of a Jewish soldier as its burden. In everything save  religion the Jews were hardly distinguishable from their neighbors.        There are--writes Cardinal Commendoni, an eye-witness--a great      many Jews in these provinces, including Lithuania, who are not,      as in other places, regarded with disrespect. They do not      maintain themselves miserably by base profits; they are landed      proprietors, are engaged in business, and even devote themselves      to the study of literature and, above all, to medicine and      astronomy; they hold almost everywhere the commission of levying      customs duties, are classed among the most honest people, wear      no outward mark to distinguish them from the Christians, and are      permitted to carry swords and walk about with their arms. In a      word they have equal rights with the other citizens.    A similar statement is made by Joseph Delmedigo, who spent many years in  Livonia and Lithuania as physician to Prince Radziwill.[14]    In his inimitable manner Gibbon describes the fierce struggle the Greek  Catholic Church had to wage before she obtained a foothold in Russia,  but he neglects to mention the fact that Judaism no less than paganism  was among her formidable opponents. The contest lasted several  centuries, and in many places it is undecided to this day.[15] The  Khazars, who had become proselytes in the eighth century, were  constantly encroaching upon Russian Christianity. Buoyant as both were  with the vigor of youth, missionary zeal was at its height among the two  contending religions. Each made war upon the other. We read that Photius  of Constantinople sent a message of thanks to Archbishop Anthony of  Kertch (858-859) for his efforts to convert the Jews; that the first  Bishop of the Established Church (1035) was \"Lukas, the little Jew\"  (Luka Zhidyata), who was appointed to his office by Yaroslav; and that  St. Feodosi Pechersky was fond of conversing with learned Jews on  matters of theology.[16] On the other hand, the efforts of the Jews were  not without success. The baptism of the pious Olga marks an era in  Russian Christianity, the beginning of the \"Judaizing heresy,\" which  centuries of persecution only strengthened. In 1425, Zacharias of Kiev,  who is reputed to have \"studied astrology, necromancy, and various other  magic arts,\" converted the priest Dionis, the Archbishop Aleksey, and,  through the latter, many more clergymen of Novgorod, Moscow, and Pskov.  Aleksey became a devout Jew. He called himself Abraham and his wife  Sarah. Yet, strange to say, he retained the favor of the Grand Duke Ivan  Vassilyevich, even after the latter's daughter-in-law, Princess Helena,  his secretary Theodore Kuritzin, the Archimandrite Sosima, the monk  Zacharias, and other persons of note had entered the fold of Judaism  through his influence.    The \"heresy\" spread over many parts of the empire, and the number of its  adherents constantly grew. Archbishop Nikk complains that in the very  monastery of Moscow there were presumably converted Jews, \"who had again  begun to practice their old Jewish religion and demoralize the young  monks.\" In Poland, too, proselytism was of frequent occurrence,  especially in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The religious  tolerance of Casimir IV (1434-1502) and his immediate successors, and  the new doctrines preached by Huss and Luther, which permeated the upper  classes of society, rendered the Poles more liberal on the one hand, and  on the other the Jews more assertive.
