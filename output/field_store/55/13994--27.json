The Anglo-Saxon name was  Eoferwic, corrupted by the Danes into Jorvik or Yorvik, which by an easy  change was developed into the modern name of York. In the York Museum is  preserved a monument to a standard-bearer of the 9th legion, which is  probably of the period of Agricola, and it is likely that Eburacum  became the headquarters of the Roman army in the north soon after the  conquest. It became the chief military town in the island; for, whereas  the southern tribes were soon subdued, those in the north were long  rebellious, and it was natural that the chief centre for troops should  be established in the more disturbed parts of Britain. Close to York was  the town of Isurium (Aldborough), where remains of pavements have been  discovered, and where it is probable that the wealthier citizens of York  had their homes. Eburacum was fortified in or before the reign of  Trajan, and was connected by a system of roads with other important  Roman towns. The Roman Camp lay on the east side of the river, on or  near the site of the present minster. One of its corner towers and  fragments of the wall still remain, and parts of the city gates have  been discovered. The camp at first covered about seventy acres of  ground; it was afterwards enlarged on the south. The modern streets of  Petergate and Stonegate represent the roads which passed through this  camp, and Bootham Bar is on the site of one of the gates. Remains of  Roman pavement have been discovered below Stonegate. The city itself  spread westward over the river, and fragments of houses and tesselated  pavements have been discovered. In 1841 remains of public baths were  found; and there are many signs that there was a large population on  this side of the river. In 1854 there was found near the southern gate  of the camp a tablet dedicated to Trajan, and commemorating the  conclusion of some work done by the 9th legion in the year 108-9. This  work was perhaps the palace of the emperors.    Near the south gate also was a Christian Church of St. Crux. The road to  Tadcaster was lined with tombs, and remains of cemeteries have been  discovered all round the city.    As in London, there are few remains of Roman masonry above ground, and  this is but natural, for the city has been burnt and destroyed, wholly  or partially, many times; and there is no doubt that Roman buildings  were used, as in Rome and other cities, as a quarry for later erections.    York is historically connected with several of the emperors. Two of  them, Severus and Constantius Chlorus, died there, and Constantine the  Great, the son of the latter, was hailed emperor at York, if it was not  the scene of his birth. At York also were the headquarters of two of the  legions, the 9th and the 6th; and there is little doubt that in course  of time it came to be regarded as the capital of the island. In fact,  according to Professor Freeman (_Macmillan's Magazine_, Sept. 1876),  \"Eburacum holds a place which is unique in the history of Britain, which  is shared by only one other city in the lands north of the Alps (Trier,  Augusta Trevirorum).\" We learn little of the history of York from Roman  historians, and next to nothing of the early Christian Church. There is  mention of York at rare intervals, when it became connected with the  general history of the empire. For instance, in 208, Severus was in  York, and it became for a time the headquarters of the court.    The Emperor Constantius died at York in 306, and there is a tradition  that hundreds of years afterwards his body was found under the Church of  St. Helen-on-the-Walls, with a lamp still burning over it. Many churches  in the neighbourhood of Eburacum were dedicated to his wife Helena, the  legendary finder of the True Cross. It has been supposed that  Constantine the Great was born at York, but this is probably untrue,  though he was proclaimed emperor there. In the middle of the fourth  century the Picts and Scots began to make inroads, and it is probable  that they captured York about 367 A.D. They were shortly afterwards  driven northwards by Theodosius the Elder. At the beginning of the fifth  century there were further invasions repelled by Stilicho, but in 409  the Emperor Honorius withdrew the Roman troops from Britain, and the  Roman period in the history of York came to an end.    Of the early ecclesiastical history of York less even is known than of  the civil. There are few relics of Roman Christianity in the city.    A stone coffin, with an apparently Christian inscription, and several  Roman ornaments bearing crosses have been found and placed in the York  Museum, but this is all. There is no evidence, documentary or other, of  the manner in which Christianity reached York. The Christian historians  give us only the most meagre references to the history of the faith in  Britain. Tertullian, for example, mentions that parts of the island as  yet unvisited by the Romans had been evangelised by British  missionaries, and, if this were so, it would seem to prove that the  Church in Britain was early active and flourishing. It is not until 314  A.D. that we come upon a definite historical fact. This was the date of  the Council of Arles, convened by Constantine, to consider the Donatist  Heresy, and among the bishops there assembled were three from  Britain--\"Eborus, Episcopus de Civitate Eboracensi; Restitutus,  Episcopus de Civitate Londinensi; Adelfius, Episcopus de Civitate Col.  Londinensium\" (perhaps Lincoln). These bishops are mentioned in the  order of precedence, and it would appear that the See of York at that  time was the most important, or perhaps the oldest, in Britain. Bishops  of York were also present at the Councils of Nicaea, Sardica, and  Arminium. With these facts our knowledge of the Roman see of Eburacum  begins and ends. The Episcopal succession probably continued for some  time after the Roman evacuation, and the legendary names of Sampson,  Pyramus or Pyrannus, and Theodicus have been handed down as bishops of  York during the struggle with the Anglo-Saxon invaders. For a long time  after the Roman evacuation jewels and plate were discovered in the  neighbourhood; and in the Pontificate of Egbert, an archbishop in the  eighth century, there is a special form of prayer for hallowing vessels  discovered on the sites of heathen temples and houses. The great Wilfrid  also, in the seventh century, speaks of recovering the sacred places  from which the British clergy had been forced to flee. It is unknown  when or how York was finally captured, but in the seventh century it was  certainly in the hands of the English; though there still remained an  independent British kingdom of Elmete, only a few miles to the west of  the city. Close to York has been discovered a large burying-place of  heathen Angles, in which the ashes were deposited in urns; the date of  this is probably the beginning of the sixth century, and at that time  the invaders must have been settled in the country, and perhaps in the  city itself. The conquest marks a change in the position of York. Under  the Roman occupation it had been an important city for military  purposes, and for that reason it was the seat of an important bishopric.  After the second conversion of England it becomes important more and  more for ecclesiastical reasons, and when it plays a part in the history  of England it is because of the action of its bishops; from this time,  therefore, it becomes necessary to say less about the city itself and  more about the see.    After the Anglo-Saxon conquest of the North of England the country  between the Tweed and the Humber was divided into two kingdoms, Bernicia  to the north of the Tees, and Deira to the south. In the reign of  Ethelfrith these two kingdoms were united, under the name of  Northumbria. Edwin, his successor, was the most powerful king in  England, and every state except Kent acknowledged his supremacy.    In the troubles after the Roman evacuation, it is probable that York  lost some of its importance, which it regained under Edwin, and became  again the capital of England. It is at this period that the authentic  ecclesiastical history of the see, and indeed of England, really begins.  In 601 Gregory the Great, in a letter to Augustine, gave him authority  to appoint twelve bishops in England, and among them a bishop of York,  who, if his mission was prosperous, was to ordain further bishops in the  North of England, remaining himself the chief of them, and being  invested with the pall, the mark of a metropolitan bishop. Provision was  made that the first bishop of York should be subordinate to Augustine,  but that subsequently the question of seniority was to be decided by  priority of consecration. Thus early did the question of precedence  between York and Canterbury arise.    We may take it that the early Christian church had entirely died out in  Northumbria, and that prior to the mission sent by Gregory there had  been no effort in the southern part of the kingdom, at least, to reclaim  the inhabitants from heathendom. York was chosen as the seat of the  metropolitan bishop in the north, entirely because of its importance as  a city. It is after this event that it becomes chiefly remarkable for  its ecclesiastical importance. Augustine died before he had followed  Gregory's instructions, and they were not carried out till 625. In that  year, Justus, the fourth bishop of Canterbury, was led by unusually  favourable circumstances to consecrate a bishop of York and to send him  to Northumbria. Edwin the king was over-lord of England, and he wished  to be allied with Kent, the only other independent kingdom in the  country. He therefore proposed to marry Ethelburga, the daughter of the  King of Kent.

Well, you won't hear it here.\"    Clapping a hand affectionately on his son's shoulder the elder man led  the way to the dining-cabin and pushed open the door.    Upon the hearth inside another bright fire glowed, and before it stood  a long roughly made table covered with immaculate enamel cloth, on  which was spread a smoking meal.    A man with a pair of merry brown eyes rose from his chair as the two  travelers entered.    \"I am glad to see you, Dr. Swift,\" he exclaimed heartily, putting out  his hand. \"So you are back to the fishing grounds once more!\"    \"I certainly am, Mr. Croyden, and thankful enough to be here. I've  brought my boy, Theodore, with me this time; Theo, we call him.\"    Mr. Croyden took the lad's hand cordially.    \"I'm glad to see you, youngster,\" he said. \"If you prove half as good  a fisherman as your father the two of you won't leave a trout or  salmon in these waters.\"    \"But I'm not a fisherman at all,\" Theo confessed. \"I never cast a fly  in my life.\"    \"You certainly have come to the right place to learn, then. Your  father has been neglecting your education, I fear. I see there is  something we can teach you.\"    \"I'm afraid there are a good many things,\" replied Theo modestly.    Mr. Croyden regarded him approvingly.    \"That's right, boy,\" he said kindly. \"Never be afraid to learn. We all  are still learning, at least I am; and I will wager your father is,  too.\"    \"A doctor is always learning,\" assented Theo's father.    \"And a business man as well,\" put in Mr. Croyden. \"When we no longer  need to learn we can be pretty sure we are near the end of our  usefulness in this world. Now suppose we begin your education, Theo,  by teaching you the proper way to eat a brook trout. How would that  lesson please you?\"    There was a twinkle in the stranger's eye.    \"Very much indeed.\"    \"I rather thought so,\" was the laughing answer. \"Here, Franz, help  Dr. Swift and his son to some of the fish I caught to-day. They are  the first of the season, Doctor, with my compliments.\" He made a  courtly gesture with his hand. \"Remember, Theo,\" he added, \"always to  open a fish up the back. In that way you can take the backbone out  whole and save yourself a deal of trouble.\"    Theo nodded his thanks for the suggestion.    What a dinner it was!    The trout were fried to a rich bronze, and the crisp potatoes were  discs of golden brown; in addition there were baked beans, smoking  brown-bread, slices of creamy cheese, and a pyramid of doughnuts. At  the conclusion of the meal Franz came running from the cook-house with  a covered dish heaped high with pancakes.    It was only when the three campers were unable to crowd down another  mouthful that they rose from the table.    \"Don't you and Theo want to come into my cabin and enjoy my fire for a  while?\" asked Mr. Croyden.    \"Why, thank you, Croyden,\" answered Dr. Swift; \"we might make you a  short call. We are off to bed early, however, so we must not stay  long.\"    Mr. Croyden's cabin proved to be a replica of the Swifts' own cozy  one, except that it was more sumptuously furnished; for Mr. Croyden,  who was a hunter as well as a fisherman, had adorned both couch and  floors with great bearskins, trophies of his luck.    As his guests entered he hurried forward to put another four-foot log  on the fire, after which he dragged out three steamer-chairs and  placed them before the blaze.    \"All the comforts of home, you see,\" he said gaily.    \"More comforts than some of us get at home,\" smiled Dr. Swift. \"There  is nothing to equal this in New York.\"    For a moment none of them spoke; they were watching the scarlet rise  and fall of the flame.    \"What a lot of company a fire is!\" mused Dr. Swift.    \"I know it,\" came from Mr. Croyden. \"And did you ever think how easily  we can produce it? Within the space of a second we can start a blaze.  A fire was quite another problem for our forefathers who lived long  before matches were invented. Think back to the time when people  rubbed dried sticks together to make a spark; or later when they were  forced to use flint and matchlock. It meant no end of work to  capture that first light, and even then it frequently went out. How  housewives struggled to keep the embers on the hearth always glowing  that a new fire might be built without so much trouble; and how men  carried from place to place coals enough to kindle other fires! When  we strike a match and so quickly get our response of flame we do not  half appreciate how fortunate we are.\"    \"I never thought what it would mean to have no matches,\" reflected  Theo.    \"Man's discovery of the use of fire was one of the first steps in his  civilization,\" Dr. Swift put in. \"It meant that henceforth instead of  eating raw food as did the other animals he could have it cooked. For  man, you must remember, is the only animal who cooks his food.\"    \"And hand in hand with the cooking came the need of dishes in which to  prepare it,\" rejoined Mr. Croyden. \"Meats could, of course, be broiled  over the fire on a forked stick; but no stews or soups could be had  until man invented some utensil which would contain liquid and at the  same time withstand the heat of the blaze. That problem was the one  that confronted all primitive races, and set them to fashioning  pottery. The history of their first attempts is most interesting.  Probably chance led people to the discovery that they could mix clay  with water, and that it would harden in the sun. They may have seen a  print of their own feet immortalized in the sun-baked mud, and caught  at the idea of taking the clay for more useful purposes. Nobody knows  where they got their first inspiration. But every race that has  existed has had its crude receptacles for food and water.\"    Theo was not sleepy now; he was far too interested to think of sleep.    \"Even in the Stone Age, when men lived in caves and great creatures  now extinct roamed the earth, men made bowls, pots, and vases, some of  which are in existence in our museums of to-day,\" continued  Mr. Croyden. \"We have, too, a few specimens of clumsy vessels made  from grayish black clay which are relics of the Lake Dwellers, who  fashioned their houses on piles, and set them in the middle of small  lakes as a protection against wild animals and rival races of  savages. Then followed what is known as the Bronze Age, and we find  that the people of this era also worked with clay. Their designs  showed a decided advance, too, even some simple decoration being  attempted.\"    \"All that was in Europe, I suppose,\" Theo ventured shyly.    \"By no means,\" replied Mr. Croyden. \"On the contrary, we have found in  our own hemisphere specimens of this prehistoric pottery. In some  cases baskets of twigs were woven and lined with clay, after which  they were baked in the fire and the twigs burned off. Other pieces  were built up from coils of clay wound round and round, and when  partly hardened these were worked together with a tool in order that  the cracks might be filled. All through the western part of our  country have been found clay relics of various early tribes of  Indians; and in some places are giant mounds in which have been buried  all sorts of crude clay jugs and bowls. Since these primal peoples  used for materials the natural clays and earths they succeeded in  producing some excellent colors, too.\"    Mr. Croyden paused.    \"Was the potter's wheel in use then?\" questioned Dr. Swift.    \"Probably not. There is no trace of it in this early work. It is not  until the historic age that we have the potter's wheel, the oldest and  first mechanical device mentioned in history. Mexicans, Peruvians,  Egyptians, Greeks, Assyrians, Romans, Gauls, Teutons all used it.\"    \"I have seen some of the old Mexican or Aztec pottery,\" declared  Dr. Swift, \"and it was very interesting. It was of reddish clay, and  I was told it was much like the variety made in Peru. Not only were  there roughly modeled dishes and jars in the collection, but also all  sorts of strange clay idols. You see, instead of worshipping the gods  of goodness, Theo, these early peoples thought they could propitiate  the gods of evil if they worshipped them instead; accordingly they  made all sorts of grotesque images, some of them very hideous. None of  this clay work was glazed, of course, for at that time men had not yet  discovered that they could put a glaze over the surface of objects and  thus protect them and render them water-tight. It was a great pity  that Cortez and his followers destroyed this early Mexican  civilization, which was surprisingly advanced.    \"I suppose the Peruvians had also gone quite as far if not further  than the Aztecs when in 1531 Pizarro invaded South America,\" rejoined  Mr. Croyden. \"They were making some very good pottery decorated in  red, black, and brown; and they must have known how to bake it, or the  colors in the design would not have lasted until now.\"    Mr. Croyden rose to stamp out a spark that had snapped from the  fireplace onto the fur rug at his feet.    \"Strange, isn't it, how much of our knowledge of the ancient races has  come down to us through their clay work?\" he reflected. \"What should  we have known of these western civilizations save through their  handiwork? And when we travel across seas it is the same. Much of our  acquaintance with Egyptian, Greek, and Roman life has been handed down  to posterity through tiles and pottery which have served to record  nations' customs and advancement. The march of the invading Roman  armies, for example, can be traced by the fragments of pottery left  behind them. These relics have been found in England, France,  Germany, Italy, and Spain, and prove that very early the Romans made  use of clay utensils for cooking their food. Even beneath the city of  London old Roman furnaces for firing dishes have been discovered;"]]]
