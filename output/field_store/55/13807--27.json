To Brutus and his companions the land  appeared a world. It was nearly four hundred miles in breadth at the  place where they landed, and, wandering northward, they found it  extending, in almost undiminished beauty and fruitfulness, further  than they had the disposition to explore it. They might have gone  northward until the twilight scarcely disappeared in the summer  nights, and have found the same verdure and beauty continuing to the  end. There were broad and undulating plains in the southern regions of  the island, and in the northern, green mountains and romantic glens;  but all, plains, valleys, and mountains, were fertile and beautiful,  and teeming with abundant sustenance for flocks, for herds, and for  man.    Brutus accordingly established himself upon the island with all his  followers, and founded a kingdom there, over which he reigned as  the founder of a dynasty. Endless tales are told of the lives, and  exploits, and quarrels of his successors down to the time of Caesar.  Conflicting claimants arose continually to dispute with each other for  the possession of power; wars were made by one tribe upon another;  cities, as they were called--though probably, in fact, they were only  rude collections of hovels--were built, fortresses were founded, and  rivers were named from princes or princesses drowned in them, in  accidental journeys, or by the violence of rival claimants to their  thrones. The pretended records contain a vast number of legends, of  very little interest or value, as the reader will readily admit  when we tell him that the famous story of King Lear is the most  entertaining one in the whole collection. It is this:    There was a king in the line named Lear. He founded the city now  called Leicester. He had three daughters, whose names were Gonilla,  Regana, and Cordiella. Cordiella was her father's favorite child. He  was, however, jealous of the affections of them all, and one day he  called them to him, and asked them for some assurance of their love.  The two eldest responded by making the most extravagant protestations.  They loved their father a thousand times better than their own souls.  They could not express, they said, the ardor and strength of their  attachment, and called Heaven and earth to witness that these  protestations were sincere.    Cordiella, all this time, stood meekly and silently by, and when her  father asked her how it was with her, she replied, \"Father, my love  toward you is as my duty bids. What can a father ask, or a daughter  promise more? They who pretend beyond this only flatter.\"    The king, who was old and childish, was much pleased with the  manifestation of love offered by Gonilla and Regana, and thought that  the honest Cordiella was heartless and cold. He treated her with  greater and greater neglect and finally decided to leave her without  any portion whatever, while he divided his kingdom between the other  two, having previously married them to princes of high rank. Cordiella  was, however, at last made choice of for a wife by a French prince,  who, it seems, knew better than the old king how much more to  be relied upon was unpretending and honest truth than empty and  extravagant profession. He married the portionless Cordiella, and took  her with him to the Continent.    The old king now having given up his kingdom to his eldest daughters,  they managed, by artifice and maneuvering, to get every thing else  away from him, so that he became wholly dependent upon them, and had  to live with them by turns. This was not all; for, at the instigation  of their husbands, they put so many indignities and affronts upon him,  that his life at length became an intolerable burden, and finally he  was compelled to leave the realm altogether, and in his destitution  and distress he went for refuge and protection to his rejected  daughter Cordiella. She received her father with the greatest alacrity  and affection. She raised an army to restore him to his rights, and  went in person with him to England to assist him in recovering them.  She was successful. The old king took possession of his throne again,  and reigned in peace for the remainder of his days. The story is of  itself nothing very remarkable, though Shakspeare has immortalized it  by making it the subject of one of his tragedies.    Centuries passed away, and at length the great Julius Caesar, who was  extending the Roman power in every direction, made his way across the  Channel, and landed in England. The particulars of this invasion  are described in our history of Julius Caesar. The Romans retained  possession of the island, in a greater or less degree, for four  hundred years.    They did not, however, hold it in peace all this time. They became  continually involved in difficulties and contests with the native  Britons, who could ill brook the oppressions of such merciless masters  as Roman generals always proved in the provinces which they pretended  to govern. One of the most formidable rebellions that the Romans had  to encounter during their disturbed and troubled sway in Britain was  led on by a woman. Her name was Boadicea. Boadicea, like almost all  other heroines, was coarse and repulsive in appearance. She was tall  and masculine in form. The tones of her voice were harsh, and she had  the countenance of a savage. Her hair was yellow. It might have been  beautiful if it had been neatly arranged, and had shaded a face which  possessed the gentle expression that belongs properly to woman. It  would then have been called golden. As it was, hanging loosely below  her waist and streaming in the wind, it made the wearer only look the  more frightful. Still, Boadicea was not by any means indifferent to  the appearance she made in the eyes of beholders. She evinced her  desire to make a favorable impression upon others, in her own  peculiar way, it is true, but in one which must have been effective,  considering what sort of beholders they were in whose eyes she  figured. She was dressed in a gaudy coat, wrought of various colors,  with a sort of mantle buttoned over it. She wore a great gold chain  about her neck, and held an ornamented spear in her hand. Thus  equipped, she appeared at the head of an army of a hundred thousand  men, and gathering them around her, she ascended a mound of earth and  harangued them--that is, as many as could stand within reach of her  voice--arousing them to sentiments of revenge against their hated  oppressors, and urging them to the highest pitch of determination and  courage for the approaching struggle. Boadicea had reason to deem the  Romans her implacable foes. They had robbed her of her treasures,  deprived her of her kingdom, imprisoned her, scourged her, and  inflicted the worst possible injuries upon her daughters. These things  had driven the wretched mother to a perfect phrensy of hate, and  aroused her to this desperate struggle for redress and revenge. But  all was in vain. In encountering the spears of Roman soldiery, she was  encountering the very hardest and sharpest steel that a cruel world  could furnish. Her army was conquered, and she killed herself by  taking poison in her despair.    By struggles such as these the contest between the Romans and the  Britons was carried on for many generations; the Romans conquering at  every trial, until, at length, the Britons learned to submit without  further resistance to their sway. In fact, there gradually came upon  the stage, during the progress of these centuries, a new power, acting  as an enemy to both the Picts and Scots; hordes of lawless barbarians,  who inhabited the mountains and morasses of Scotland and Ireland.  These terrible savages made continual irruptions into the southern  country for plunder, burning and destroying, as they retired, whatever  they could not carry away. They lived in impregnable and almost  inaccessible fastnesses, among dark glens and precipitous mountains,  and upon gloomy islands surrounded by iron-bound coasts and stormy  seas. The Roman legions made repeated attempts to hunt them out of  these retreats, but with very little success. At length a line of  fortified posts was established across the island, near where the  boundary line now lies between England and Scotland; and by guarding  this line, the Roman generals who had charge of Britain attempted to  protect the inhabitants of the southern country, who had learned at  length to submit peaceably to their sway.    One of the most memorable events which occurred during the time that  the Romans held possession of the island of Britain was the visit of  one of the emperors to this northern extremity of his dominions. The  name of this emperor was Severus. He was powerful and prosperous at  home, but his life was embittered by one great calamity, the dissolute  character and the perpetual quarrels of his sons. To remove them from  Rome, where they disgraced both themselves and their father by their  vicious lives, and the ferocious rivalry and hatred they bore to each  other, Severus planned an excursion to Britain, taking them with him,  in the hope of turning their minds into new channels of thought, and  awakening in them some new and nobler ambition.    At the time when Severus undertook this expedition, he was advanced in  age and very infirm. He suffered much from the gout, so that he  was unable to travel by any ordinary conveyance, and was borne,  accordingly, almost all the way upon a litter. He crossed the Channel  with his army, and, leaving one of his sons in command in the south  part of the island, he advanced with the other, at the head of an  enormous force, determined to push boldly forward into the heart  of Scotland, and to bring the war with the Picts and Scots to an  effectual end.    He met, however,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16546"],[0,"Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 2 (#2)"],[1,"the Mahayana is  uncertain, its teaching fanciful and its scriptures tedious, yet it  has been a force of the first magnitude in the secular history and art  of China, Japan and Tibet and even to-day the most metaphysical of its  sacred books, the Diamond Cutter, has probably more readers than Kant  and Hegel.    Since the early history of the Mahayana is a matter for argument  rather than precise statement, it will perhaps be best to begin with  some account of its doctrines and literature and proceed afterwards to  chronology. I may, however, mention that general tradition connects it  with King Kanishka and asserts that the great doctors Asvaghosha and  Nagarjuna lived in and immediately after his reign. The attitude of  Kanishka and of the Council which he summoned towards the Mahayana is  far from clear and I shall say something about this difficult subject  below. Unfortunately his date is not beyond dispute for while a  considerable consensus of opinion fixes his accession at about 78  A.D., some scholars place it earlier and others in the second century  A.D.[4] Apart from this, it appears established that the  Sukhavati-vyuha which is definitely Mahayanist was translated into  Chinese between 147 and 186 A.D. We may assume that it was then  already well known and had been composed some time before, so that,  whatever Kanishka's date may have been, Mahayanist doctrines must have  been in existence about the time of the Christian era, and perhaps  considerably earlier. Naturally no one date like a reign or a council  can be selected to mark the beginning of a great school. Such a body  of doctrine must have existed piecemeal and unauthorized before it was  collected and recognized and some tenets are older than others.  Enlarging I-Ching's definition we may find in the Mahayana seven lines  of thought or practice. All are not found in all sects and some are  shared with the Hinayana but probably none are found fully developed  outside the Mahayana. Many of them have parallels in the contemporary  phases of Hinduism.    1. A belief in Bodhisattvas and in the power of human beings to become  Bodhisattvas.    2. A code of altruistic ethics which teaches that everyone must do  good in the interest of the whole world and make over to others any  merit he may acquire by his virtues. The aim of the religious life is  to become a Bodhisattva, not to become an Arhat.    3. A doctrine that Buddhas are supernatural beings, distributed  through infinite space and time, and innumerable. In the language of  later theology a Buddha has three bodies and still later there is a  group of five Buddhas.    4. Various systems of idealist metaphysics, which tend to regard the  Buddha essence or Nirvana much as Brahman is regarded in the Vedanta.    5. A canon composed in Sanskrit and apparently later than the Pali  Canon.    6. Habitual worship of images and elaboration of ritual. There is a  dangerous tendency to rely on formulae and charms.    7. A special doctrine of salvation by faith in a Buddha, usually  Amitabha, and invocation of his name. Mahayanism can exist without  this doctrine but it is tolerated by most sects and considered  essential by some.

This word means one whose essence is knowledge but is  used in the technical sense of a being who is in process of obtaining  but has not yet obtained Buddhahood. The Pali Canon shows little  interest in the personality of Bodhisattvas and regards them simply as  the preliminary or larval form of a Buddha, either Sakyamuni[5] or  some of his predecessors. It was incredible that a being so superior  to ordinary humanity as a Buddha should be suddenly produced in a  human family nor could he be regarded as an incarnation in the strict  sense. But it was both logical and edifying to suppose that he was the  product of a long evolution of virtue, of good deeds and noble  resolutions extending through countless ages and culminating in a  being superior to the Devas. Such a being awaited in the Tushita  heaven the time fixed for his appearance on earth as a Buddha and his  birth was accompanied by marvels. But though the Pali Canon thus  recognizes the Bodhisattva as a type which, if rare, yet makes its  appearance at certain intervals, it leaves the matter there. It is not  suggested that saints should try to become Bodhisattvas and Buddhas,  or that Bodhisattvas can be helpers of mankind.[6] But both these  trains of thought are natural developments of the older ideas and soon  made themselves prominent. It is a characteristic doctrine of  Mahayanism that men can try and should try to become Bodhisattvas.    In the Pali Canon we hear of Arhats, Pacceka Buddhas, and perfect  Buddhas. For all three the ultimate goal is the same, namely Nirvana,  but a Pacceka Buddha is greater than an Arhat, because he has greater  intellectual powers though he is not omniscient, and a perfect Buddha  is greater still, partly because he is omniscient and partly because  he saves others. But if we admit that the career of the Buddha is  better and nobler, and also that it is, as the Introduction to the  Jataka recounts, simply the result of an earnest resolution to school  himself and help others, kept firmly through the long chain of  existences, there is nothing illogical or presumptuous in making our  goal not the quest of personal salvation, but the attainment of  Bodhisattvaship, that is the state of those who may aspire to become  Buddhas. In fact the Arhat, engrossed in his own salvation, is excused  only by his humility and is open to the charge of selfish desire,  since the passion for Nirvana is an ambition like any other and the  quest for salvation can be best followed by devoting oneself entirely  to others. But though my object here is to render intelligible the  Mahayanist point of view including its objections to Hinayanism, I  must defend the latter from the accusation of selfishness. The  vigorous and authoritative character of Gotama led him to regard all  mankind as patients requiring treatment and to emphasize the truth  that they could cure themselves if they would try. But the Buddhism of  the Pali Canon does not ignore the duties of loving and instructing  others;[7] it merely insists on man's power to save himself if  properly instructed and bids him do it at once: \"sell all that thou  hast and follow me.\" And the Mahayana, if less self-centred, has also  less self-reliance, and self-discipline. It is more human and  charitable, but also more easygoing: it teaches the believer to lean  on external supports which if well chosen may be a help, but if  trusted without discrimination become paralyzing abuses. And if we  look at the abuses of both systems the fossilized monk of the Hinayana  will compare favourably with the tantric adept. It was to the  corruptions of the Mahayana rather than of the Hinayana that the decay  of Buddhism in India was due.    The career of the Bodhisattva was early divided into stages (bhumi)  each marked by the acquisition of some virtue in his triumphant  course. The stages are variously reckoned as five, seven and ten. The  Mahavastu,[8] which is the earliest work where the progress is  described, enumerates ten without distinguishing them very clearly.  Later writers commonly look at the Bodhisattva's task from the humbler  point of view of the beginner who wishes to learn the initiatory  stages. For them the Bodhisattva is primarily not a supernatural being  or even a saint but simply a religious person who wishes to perform  the duties and enjoy the privileges of the Church to the full, much  like a communicant in the language of contemporary Christianity. We  have a manual for those who would follow this path, in the  Bodhicaryavatara of Santideva, which in its humility, sweetness and  fervent piety has been rightly compared with the De Imitatione  Christi. In many respects the virtues of the Bodhisattva are those of  the Arhat. His will must be strenuous and concentrated; he must  cultivate the strictest morality, patience, energy, meditation and  knowledge. But he is also a devotee, a _bhakta_: he adores all the  Buddhas of the past, present and future as well as sundry superhuman  Bodhisattvas, and he confesses his sins, not after the fashion of the  Patimokkha, but by accusing himself before these heavenly Protectors  and vowing to sin no more.    Santideva lived in the seventh century[9] but tells us that he follows  the scriptures and has nothing new to say. This seems to be true for,  though his book being a manual of devotion presents its subject-matter  in a dogmatic form, its main ideas are stated and even elaborated in  the Lotus. Not only are eminent figures in the Church, such as  Sariputra and Ananda, there designated as future Buddhas, but the same  dignity is predicted wholesale for five hundred and again for two  thousand monks while in Chapter X is sketched the course to be  followed by \"young men or young"]]]
