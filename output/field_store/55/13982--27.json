Kinney  780 West End Avenue, New York      Notes by Hooper Harris    How are you? Welcome! Welcome!    After arriving today, although weary with travel, I had the utmost longing  and yearning to see you and could not resist this meeting. Now that I have  met you, all my weariness has vanished, for your meeting is the cause of  spiritual happiness.    I was in Egypt and was not feeling well, but I wished to come to you in  America. My friends said, \"This is a long journey; the sea is wide; you  should remain here.\" But the more they advised and insisted, the greater  became my longing to take this trip, and now I have come to America to  meet the friends of God. This long voyage will prove how great is my love  for you. There were many troubles and vicissitudes, but, in the thought of  meeting you, all these things vanished and were forgotten.    I am greatly pleased with the city of New York. Its harbor entrance, its  piers, buildings and broad avenues are magnificent and beautiful. Truly,  it is a wonderful city. As New York has made such progress in material  civilization, I hope that it may also advance spiritually in the Kingdom  and Covenant of God so that the friends here may become the cause of the  illumination of America, that this city may become the city of love and  that the fragrances of God may be spread from this place to all parts of  the world. I have come for this. I pray that you may be manifestations of  the love of Baha'u'llah, that each one of you may become like a clear lamp  of crystal from which the rays of the bounties of the Blessed Perfection  may shine forth to all nations and peoples. This is my highest aspiration.    It was a long, long trip. The more we traveled, the greater seemed the  expanse of the sea. The weather was brilliant and fine throughout; there  was no storm and no end to the sea.    I am very happy to meet you all here today. Praise be to God that your  faces are shining with the love of Baha'u'llah. To behold them is the  cause of great spiritual happiness. We have arranged to meet you every day  at the homes of the friends.    In the East people were asking me, \"Why do you undertake this long voyage?  Your body cannot endure such hardships of travel.\" When it is necessary,  my body can endure everything. It has withstood forty years of  imprisonment and can still undergo the utmost trials.    I will see you again. Now I will greet each one of you personally. It is  my hope that you will all be happy and that we may meet again and again.          12 April 1912  Talk at Home of Mr. and Mrs. Howard MacNutt  935 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, New York      Notes by Howard MacNutt    This is a most happy visit. I have crossed the sea from the land of the  Orient for the joy of meeting the friends of God. Although I am weary  after my long journey, the light of the spirit shining in your faces  brings me rest and reward. In this meeting the divine susceptibilities are  radiant. This is a spiritual house, the home of the spirit. There is no  discord here; all is love and unity. When souls are gathered together in  this way, the divine bestowals descend. The purpose of the creation of man  is the attainment of the supreme virtues of humanity through descent of  the heavenly bestowals. The purpose of man's creation is, therefore, unity  and harmony, not discord and separateness. If the atoms which compose the  kingdom of the minerals were without affinity for each other, the earth  would never have been formed, the universe could not have been created.  Because they have affinity for each other, the power of life is able to  manifest itself, and the organisms of the phenomenal world become  possible. When this attraction or atomic affinity is destroyed, the power  of life ceases to manifest; death and nonexistence result.    It is so, likewise, in the spiritual world. That world is the Kingdom of  complete attraction and affinity. It is the Kingdom of the One Divine  Spirit, the Kingdom of God. Therefore, the affinity and love manifest in  this meeting, the divine susceptibilities witnessed here are not of this  world but of the world of the Kingdom. When the souls become separated and  selfish, the divine bounties do not descend, and the lights of the Supreme  Concourse are no longer reflected even though the bodies meet together.

REFERENCES TO THE QUR'AN      In footnotes referring to the Qur'an the surihs have been numbered  according to the original, whereas the verse numbers are those in  Rodwell's translation which differ sometimes from those of the Arabic.            1: O PEOPLES OF THE WORLD! THE SUN OF TRUTH HATH ...      O peoples of the world! The Sun of Truth hath risen to illumine the whole  earth, and to spiritualize the community of man. Laudable are the results  and the fruits thereof, abundant the holy evidences deriving from this  grace. This is mercy unalloyed and purest bounty; it is light for the  world and all its peoples; it is harmony and fellowship, and love and  solidarity; indeed it is compassion and unity, and the end of foreignness;  it is the being at one, in complete dignity and freedom, with all on  earth.    The Blessed Beauty saith: 'Ye are all the fruits of one tree, the leaves  of one branch.' Thus hath He likened this world of being to a single tree,  and all its peoples to the leaves thereof, and the blossoms and fruits. It  is needful for the bough to blossom, and leaf and fruit to flourish, and  upon the interconnection of all parts of the world-tree, dependeth the  flourishing of leaf and blossom, and the sweetness of the fruit.    For this reason must all human beings powerfully sustain one another and  seek for everlasting life; and for this reason must the lovers of God in  this contingent world become the mercies and the blessings sent forth by  that clement King of the seen and unseen realms. Let them purify their  sight and behold all humankind as leaves and blossoms and fruits of the  tree of being. Let them at all times concern themselves with doing a  kindly thing for one of their fellows, offering to someone love,  consideration, thoughtful help. Let them see no one as their enemy, or as  wishing them ill, but think of all humankind as their friends; regarding  the alien as an intimate, the stranger as a companion, staying free of  prejudice, drawing no lines.    In this day, the one favoured at the Threshold of the Lord is he who  handeth round the cup of faithfulness; who bestoweth, even upon his  enemies, the jewel of bounty, and lendeth, even to his fallen oppressor, a  helping hand; it is he who will, even to the fiercest of his foes, be a  loving friend. These are the Teachings of the Blessed Beauty, these the  counsels of the Most Great Name.    O ye dear friends! The world is at war and the human race is in travail  and mortal combat. The dark night of hate hath taken over, and the light  of good faith is blotted out. The peoples and kindreds of the earth have  sharpened their claws, and are hurling themselves one against the other.  It is the very foundation of the human race that is being destroyed. It is  thousands of households that are vagrant and dispossessed, and every year  seeth thousands upon thousands of human beings weltering in their  life-blood on dusty battlefields. The tents of life and joy are down. The  generals practise their generalship, boasting of the blood they shed,  competing one with the next in inciting to violence. 'With this sword,'  saith one of them, 'I beheaded a people!' And another: 'I toppled a nation  to the ground!' And yet another: 'I brought a government down!' On such  things do men pride themselves, in such do they glory!  Love--righteousness--these are everywhere censured, while despised are  harmony, and devotion to the truth.    The Faith of the Blessed Beauty is summoning mankind to safety and love,  to amity and peace; it hath raised up its tabernacle on the heights of the  earth, and directeth its call to all nations. Wherefore, O ye who are  God's lovers, know ye the value of this precious Faith, obey its  teachings, walk in this road that is drawn straight, and show ye this way  to the people. Lift up your voices and sing out the song of the Kingdom.  Spread far and wide the precepts and counsels of the loving Lord, so that  this world will change into another world, and this darksome earth will be  flooded with light, and the dead body of mankind will arise and live; so  that every soul will ask for immortality, through the holy breaths of God.    Soon will your swiftly-passing days be over, and the fame and riches, the  comforts, the joys provided by this rubbish-heap, the world, will be gone  without a trace. Summon ye, then, the people to God, and invite humanity  to follow the example of the Company on high. Be ye loving fathers to the  orphan, and a refuge to the helpless, and a treasury for the poor, and a  cure for the ailing. Be ye the helpers of every victim of oppression, the  patrons of the disadvantaged. Think ye at all times of rendering some  service to every member of the human race. Pay ye no heed to aversion and  rejection, to disdain, hostility, injustice: act ye in the opposite way.  Be ye sincerely kind, not in appearance only. Let each one of God's loved  ones centre his attention on this: to be the Lord's mercy to man; to be  the Lord's grace. Let him do some good to every person whose path he  crosseth, and be of some benefit to him. Let him improve the character of  each and all, and reorient the minds of men. In this "]]]
