How deeply is it to be regretted, how much is it to be wondered at,  that, in a country whose school of painting, though degraded by its  system of meretricious coloring, and disgraced by hosts of would-be  imitators of inimitable individuals, is yet raised by the distinguished  talent of those individuals to a place of well-deserved honor; and the  studios of whose sculptors are filled with designs of the most pure  simplicity, and most perfect animation; the school of architecture  should be so miserably debased!    5. There are, however, many reasons for a fact so lamentable. In the  first place, the patrons of architecture (I am speaking of all classes  of buildings, from the lowest to the highest), are a more numerous and  less capable class than those of painting. The general public, and I say  it with sorrow, because I know it from observation, have little to do  with the encouragement of the school of painting, beyond the power which  they unquestionably possess, and unmercifully use, of compelling our  artists to substitute glare for beauty. Observe the direction of public  taste at any of our exhibitions. We see visitors at that of the Society  of Painters in Water Colors, passing Tayler with anathemas and Lewis  with indifference, to remain in reverence and admiration before certain  amiable white lambs and water-lilies, whose artists shall be nameless.  We see them, in the Royal Academy, passing by Wilkie, Turner and  Callcott, with shrugs of doubt or of scorn, to fix in gazing and  enthusiastic crowds upon kettles-full of witches, and His Majesty's  ships so and so lying to in a gale, etc., etc. But these pictures attain  no celebrity because the public admire them, for it is not to the public  that the judgment is intrusted. It is by the chosen few, by our nobility  and men of taste and talent, that the decision is made, the fame  bestowed, and the artist encouraged.    6. Not so in architecture. There, the power is generally diffused. Every  citizen may box himself up in as barbarous a tenement as suits his taste  or inclination; the architect is his vassal, and must permit him not  only to criticise, but to perpetrate. The palace or the nobleman's seat  may be raised in good taste, and become the admiration of a nation; but  the influence of their owner is terminated by the boundary of his  estate: he has no command over the adjacent scenery, and the possessor  of every thirty acres around him has him at his mercy. The streets of  our cities are examples of the effects of this clashing of different  tastes; and they are either remarkable for the utter absence of all  attempt at embellishment, or disgraced by every variety of abomination.    7. Again, in a climate like ours, those few who have knowledge and  feeling to distinguish what is beautiful, are frequently prevented by  various circumstances from erecting it. John Bull's comfort perpetually  interferes with his good taste, and I should be the first to lament his  losing so much of his nationality, as to permit the latter to prevail.  He cannot put his windows into a recess, without darkening his rooms; he  cannot raise a narrow gable above his walls, without knocking his head  against the rafters; and, worst of all, he cannot do either, without  being stigmatized by the awful, inevitable epithet, of \"a very odd man.\"  But, though much of the degradation of our present school of  architecture is owing to the want or the unfitness of patrons, surely it  is yet more attributable to a lamentable deficiency of taste and talent  among our architects themselves. It is true, that in a country affording  so little encouragement, and presenting so many causes for its absence,  it cannot be expected that we should have any Michael Angelo  Buonarottis. The energy of our architects is expended in raising \"neat\"  poor-houses, and \"pretty\" charity schools; and, if they ever enter upon  a work of higher rank, economy is the order of the day: plaster and  stucco are substituted for granite and marble; rods of splashed iron for  columns of verd-antique; and in the wild struggle after novelty, the  fantastic is mistaken for the graceful, the complicated for the  imposing, superfluity of ornament for beauty, and its total absence for  simplicity.    8. But all these disadvantages might in some degree be counteracted, all  these abuses in some degree prevented, were it not for the slight  attention paid by our architects to that branch of the art which I have  above designated as the Poetry of Architecture. All unity of feeling  (which is the first principle of good taste) is neglected; we see  nothing but incongruous combination: we have pinnacles without height,  windows without light, columns with nothing to sustain, and buttresses  with nothing to support. We have parish paupers smoking their pipes and  drinking their beer under Gothic arches and sculptured niches; and quiet  old English gentlemen reclining on crocodile stools, and peeping out of  the windows of Swiss chalets.    9. I shall attempt, therefore, to endeavor to illustrate the principle  from the neglect of which these abuses have arisen; that of unity of  feeling, the basis of all grace, the essence of all beauty. We shall  consider the architecture of nations as it is influenced by their  feelings and manners, as it is connected with the scenery in which it is  found, and with the skies under which it was erected; we shall be led as  much to the street and the cottage as to the temple and the tower; and  shall be more interested in buildings raised by feeling, than in those  corrected by rule. We shall commence with the lower class of edifices,  proceeding from the roadside to the village, and from the village to the  city; and, if we succeed in directing the attention of a single  individual more directly to this most interesting department of the  science of architecture, we shall not have written in vain.          _PART I._    The Cottage.

THE POETRY OF ARCHITECTURE.        I.    THE LOWLAND COTTAGE--ENGLAND AND FRANCE.      10. Of all embellishments by which the efforts of man can enhance the  beauty of natural scenery, those are the most effective which can give  animation to the scene, while the spirit which they bestow is in unison  with its general character. It is generally desirable to indicate the  presence of animated existence in a scene of natural beauty; but only of  such existence as shall be imbued with the spirit, and shall partake of  the essence, of the beauty, which, without it, would be dead. If our  object, therefore, is to embellish a scene the character of which is  peaceful and unpretending, we must not erect a building fit for the  abode of wealth or pride. However beautiful or imposing in itself, such  an object immediately indicates the presence of a kind of existence  unsuited to the scenery which it inhabits; and of a mind which, when it  sought retirement, was unacquainted with its own ruling feelings, and  which consequently excites no sympathy in ours: but, if we erect a  dwelling which may appear adapted to the wants, and sufficient for the  comfort, of a gentle heart and lowly mind, we have instantly attained  our object: we have bestowed animation, but we have not disturbed  repose.    11. It is for this reason that the cottage is one of the embellishments  of natural scenery which deserve attentive consideration. It is  beautiful always, and everywhere. Whether looking out of the woody  dingle with its eye-like window, and sending up the motion of azure  smoke between the silver trunks of aged trees; or grouped among the  bright cornfields of the fruitful plain; or forming gray clusters along  the slope of the mountain side, the cottage always gives the idea of a  thing to be beloved: a quiet life-giving voice, that is as peaceful as  silence itself.    12. With these feelings, we shall devote some time to the consideration  of the prevailing character, and national peculiarities, of European  cottages. The principal thing worthy of observation in the lowland  cottage of England is its finished neatness. The thatch is firmly pegged  down, and mathematically leveled at the edges; and, though the martin is  permitted to attach his humble domicile, in undisturbed security, to the  eaves, he may be considered as enhancing the effect of the cottage, by  increasing its usefulness, and making it contribute to the comfort of  more beings than one. The whitewash is stainless, and its rough surface  catches a side light as brightly as a front one: the luxuriant rose is  trained gracefully over the window; and the gleaming lattice, divided  not into heavy squares, but into small pointed diamonds, is thrown half  open, as is just discovered by its glance among the green leaves of the  sweetbrier, to admit the breeze, that, as it passes over the flowers,  becomes full of their fragrance. The light wooden porch breaks the flat  of the cottage face by its projection; and a branch or two of wandering  honeysuckle spread over the low hatch. A few square feet of garden and a  latched wicket, persuading the weary and dusty pedestrian, with  expressive eloquence, to lean upon it for an instant and request a drink  of water or milk, complete a picture, which, if it be far enough from  London to be unspoiled by town sophistications, is a very perfect thing  in its way.[1] The ideas it awakens are agreeable, and the architecture  is all that we want in such a situation. It is pretty and appropriate;  and if it boasted of any other perfection, it would be at the expense of  its propriety.

When young Mrs. Kangaroo goes for a hop,  To call or to market or, perhaps, out to shop,  She has no nice carriage where baby can ride,  So he creeps in a pocket that hangs at her side.    He does not care when the sleet comes down, or the chilly wind blows strong,  For he wears a hat that is made of horn and a fur coat, warm and long.  He never gets frostbitten toes 'though in snow and ice he plays;  Now being a Muskox can't be bad in the long, cold winter days!    \"The very best I have, sir, fine and a whole yard wide,  It wears, and has no bother of a right and wrong side;  I'm sure she'd like a dress of it--it will not spot or pull.\"  Then Miss Alpaca added: \"I know--it's my own wool.\"    This dear little Sheep has lost Bo-Peep,  She wandered away as he lay asleep,  He has found her bonnet and shepherd's crook,  But for little Bo-Peep in vain does he look.    Young Miss Rhinoceros gave a beach party;  She greeted her friends with a welcome most hearty.  They laughed and they joked and they swam in the sea,  And the party was gay, as a party should be.    She comes from Spain, this proud, proud Dame,  Mistress Merino is her name.  Her wool weaves into dress goods rare,  Her skin makes gloves the ladies wear.    Merry guinea pigs one day  Went out in the fields to play.  Daisy smiled and wished that they  Would never, never go away.    Here is a Sister Piggy and a Brother Piggy, too,  The story they are telling here would not apply to you,  For selfish little sisters who make their brothers cry  Do not belong in houses but with piggies in the sty.    Now here's a little lady who seems a wee bit shy,  Or is it that a teardrop is trembling in her eye?  Well, I am sure that you or I would make an awful fuss  If we should have to have her name--\"Miss Hippopotamus.\"    In animal land, as everywhere, there lives a Mr. Boar  Who never is contented unless he holds the floor;  His fellows all may frown at him but he cannot refrain  From pushing into everything--he's so selfish and so vain.    Mother and father and little Miss Bear  Went out for a walk and a bit of fresh air,  Not through the dark woods (the old tale to repeat)  But in their best clothes, right down the front street.    When little Miss Polar Bear goes out to skate,  She never is bothered by having to wait  Until mother wraps her all snugly in fur,  For those are the clothes that she carries with her!    Just look about and see if you  Can find a friend who's quite as true  As this old Doggie that you see  A-smiling here at you and me.    I'm just a little Puppy and good as good can be,  And why they call me naughty, I'm sure I cannot see,  I've only carried off one shoe and torn the baby's hat  And chased the ducks and spilled the milk--there's nothing bad in that!    The mandrill looks so very queer  I'm glad he lives way off from here;  He's purple, blue, red, black and brown,  I'm sure he is the jungle clown.    The baby gorilla, of the family called Ape,  Is very like you in size and in shape,  But he lives in the jungle with black hair for clothes  And he gets very naughty the older he grows.    This cute little brother and sister you see  Seated cosily high on the limb of a tree  Are the Marmoset twins, whose appealing round eyes  Look from flower-like faces in wond'ring surprise.    \"I've climbed up here to smile at you and, oh, what do you think?  I've scattered master's papers and upset all of his ink,  But then if little Monkeys always were so very good  They'd not be little monkeys who just can't act as they should.\"    He is so very lazy that he is even loath  To walk upon his own feet--this funny boy named Sloth.  He swings upon the branches from morning until night,  And eats the leaves about him with laziest delight.    He works on tunnels night and day,  This Marmot boy from far away.  When winter comes then in he creeps,  And there until the spring he sleeps.    The woodchuck resides in a hole in the ground,  He is surly and cross, and he never is found  Out in the bright sunlight unless it's to see  If he can't make more winter for you and for me.    This naughty boy just eats and eats until he is a sight,  He eats until he cannot hold another tiny bite.  Of course, he's just an animal--they call him Wolverine--  But does he make you think of boys that you have ever seen?    Old Mr. Walrus climbs out of the deep  For a breath of air and an hour of sleep.  You will note that he isn't much on looks  But his skin we make into pocket-books.    He sits on the top of a gay wooden stand,  He stands on his head or he shakes your hand,  He dances a jig or he trumps a chant--  This jolly old circus Elephant.    Naughty, naughty Squirrel baby, just as mother has you dressed  In your ribbons and your laces and your go-to-meeting best,  Then to run and grab an apple and get yourself all mussed!  Are you not afraid that mother will be very, very fussed?    To market, to market, with baskets of eggs,  Jack Rabbit goes hurrying on his long legs;  He'll buy him some colors--red, green, yellow, blue,  And when Easter comes 'round you know what he'll do.    Chipmunk is a jolly lad,  Always friendly--never sad,  Shares with friends his wheat grains yellow,  He's a genuine good fellow.    The coney lives in Palestine  But he is very seldom seen.  You see he is so small and shy  He hides when folks are passing by.    They call this boy the Coati,  His name is strange, and so is he.  He laps to drink, digs with his snout.  On ground or trees he runs about.    The cute little dogs that live on the prairie  Were having a party and making quite merry,  When Big Dog, on watch, heard a noise and called \"Hush!\"  And into their holes went the guests in a rush!    What do you suppose is in Gray Wolf's pack  He carries so stealthily over his back?  Some chickens, a lamb and an old mother hen  He has stolen to hide away in his den.    His manners are so charming and his eyes so very bright,  I do believe that we might call young Fox a gallant knight;  But then when he is cunning and just a little pert,  I'm not so sure but we should call this same young fox a flirt.    We just want to ask if you ever have seen a  Much dirtier boy than this little Hyena?  He has played in the street at making mud pies  Till nothing is clean save the whites of his eyes.    Beau coyote sings a nightly tune  To his lady fair in the big, round moon.  She smiles and throws moonbeams to him  And he serenades till her light is dim.    Tommie and Tillie Badger went out in the field to play.  Said Tommie: \"Here, I'll teach you--put down your head this way,  Then toss your heels into the air and give a little twirl--  You can't help turning somersaults although you are a girl.\"    Miss Leopard Spermophilus, with her high-sounding name,  Says just to be called \"Gopher\" is really a shame,  And she's right here to tell you--if this knowledge you should lack--  She's the only one who wears the stars and stripes upon her back.    Doggy barked and said: \"What fun  To make that Porcupine girl run;  Girls for boys to tease were meant.\"--  But girls with pins are different.    Sir Knight Armadillo, from tail tip to nose  In armor that's sure to bring terror to foes,  Goes forth with his weapons to his battle ground,  And looks like a pineapple walking around.    Away in Australia the Echidna stays.  He is noted because of his strange little ways;  His claws are so sharp that in manner quite tragic,  When frightened he sinks in the ground as by magic.    Miss Ant Eater's mouth is so dreadfully small  It scarce seems it could be a real mouth at all,  And her long, furry tail is her blanket at night,  It covers and tucks her in all snug and tight.    This queer little Mole has a star for a nose  Just the shade of the pink in a dew-wet rose.  He lives down in the ground where 'tis always like night,  So perhaps his star nose is to twinkle for light.    Here we have Mr. Duckbill of no little fame;  His mouth, you will see, is what gives him his name.  He can walk, swim or burrow and (so we have heard)  His wife, Mrs. Duckbill, lays eggs like a bird.    Such a dainty little person in her coat of pale, clear gray,  Is this maiden, Miss Chinchilla, and the hunter-folks all say  She is so clean she's exquisite and never dreams of harm  When they go to take her silken fur which helps to keep her warm.    The circus fat lady is big Mrs. Whale  With her very large head and her very long tail,  And her ears and her eyes almost covered from sight  In the folds of thick skin that wraps her up tight.
