The public demanded sharply  that the seas should at any price be relieved from this formidable  cetacean.[1]      [1] Member of the whale family.        CHAPTER II    PRO AND CON    At the period when these events took place, I had just returned from a  scientific research in the disagreeable territory of Nebraska, in the  United States.  In virtue of my office as Assistant Professor in the  Museum of Natural History in Paris, the French Government had attached  me to that expedition.  After six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New  York towards the end of March, laden with a precious collection.  My  departure for France was fixed for the first days in May.  Meanwhile I  was occupying myself in classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and  zoological riches, when the accident happened to the Scotia.    I was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day.  How could I be otherwise?  I had read and reread all the American and  European papers without being any nearer a conclusion.  This mystery  puzzled me.  Under the impossibility of forming an opinion, I jumped  from one extreme to the other.  That there really was something could  not be doubted, and the incredulous were invited to put their finger on  the wound of the Scotia.    On my arrival at New York the question was at its height.  The theory  of the floating island, and the unapproachable sandbank, supported by  minds little competent to form a judgment, was abandoned.  And, indeed,  unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its  position with such astonishing rapidity?    From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck  was given up.    There remained, then, only two possible solutions of the question,  which created two distinct parties:  on one side, those who were for a  monster of colossal strength; on the other, those who were for a  submarine vessel of enormous motive power.    But this last theory, plausible as it was, could not stand against  inquiries made in both worlds.  That a private gentleman should have  such a machine at his command was not likely.  Where, when, and how was  it built? and how could its construction have been kept secret?  Certainly a Government might possess such a destructive machine.  And  in these disastrous times, when the ingenuity of man has multiplied the  power of weapons of war, it was possible that, without the knowledge of  others, a State might try to work such a formidable engine.    But the idea of a war machine fell before the declaration of  Governments.  As public interest was in question, and transatlantic  communications suffered, their veracity could not be doubted.  But how  admit that the construction of this submarine boat had escaped the  public eye?  For a private gentleman to keep the secret under such  circumstances would be very difficult, and for a State whose every act  is persistently watched by powerful rivals, certainly impossible.    Upon my arrival in New York several persons did me the honour of  consulting me on the phenomenon in question.  I had published in France  a work in quarto, in two volumes, entitled Mysteries of the Great  Submarine Grounds.  This book, highly approved of in the learned world,  gained for me a special reputation in this rather obscure branch of  Natural History.  My advice was asked.  As long as I could deny the  reality of the fact, I confined myself to a decided negative.  But  soon, finding myself driven into a corner, I was obliged to explain  myself point by point.  I discussed the question in all its forms,  politically and scientifically; and I give here an extract from a  carefully-studied article which I published in the number of the 30th  of April.  It ran as follows:    \"After examining one by one the different theories, rejecting all other  suggestions, it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a marine  animal of enormous power.    \"The great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us.  Soundings  cannot reach them.  What passes in those remote depths--what beings  live, or can live, twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the  waters--what is the organisation of these animals, we can scarcely  conjecture.  However, the solution of the problem submitted to me may  modify the form of the dilemma.  Either we do know all the varieties of  beings which people our planet, or we do not.  If we do NOT know them  all--if Nature has still secrets in the deeps for us, nothing is more  conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes, or  cetaceans of other kinds, or even of new species, of an organisation  formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings, and which an  accident of some sort has brought at long intervals to the upper level  of the ocean.    \"If, on the contrary, we DO know all living kinds, we must necessarily  seek for the animal in question amongst those marine beings already  classed; and, in that case, I should be disposed to admit the existence  of a gigantic narwhal.    \"The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea, often attains a length of  sixty feet.  Increase its size fivefold or tenfold, give it strength  proportionate to its size, lengthen its destructive weapons, and you  obtain the animal required.  It will have the proportions determined by  the officers of the Shannon, the instrument required by the perforation  of the Scotia, and the power necessary to pierce the hull of the  steamer.    \"Indeed, the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword, a halberd,  according to the expression of certain naturalists.  The principal tusk  has the hardness of steel.  Some of these tusks have been found buried  in the bodies of whales, which the unicorn always attacks with success.  Others have been drawn out, not without trouble, from the bottoms of  ships, which they had pierced through and through, as a gimlet pierces  a barrel.  The Museum of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris possesses one  of these defensive weapons, two yards and a quarter in length, and  fifteen inches in diameter at the base.    \"Very well! suppose this weapon to be six times stronger and the animal  ten times more powerful; launch it at the rate of twenty miles an hour,  and you obtain a shock capable of producing the catastrophe required.  Until further information, therefore, I shall maintain it to be a  sea-unicorn of colossal dimensions, armed not with a halberd, but with  a real spur, as the armoured frigates, or the `rams' of war, whose  massiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time.  Thus  may this puzzling phenomenon be explained, unless there be something  over and above all that one has ever conjectured, seen, perceived, or  experienced; which is just within the bounds of possibility.\"    These last words were cowardly on my part; but, up to a certain point,  I wished to shelter my dignity as professor, and not give too much  cause for laughter to the Americans, who laugh well when they do laugh.  I reserved for myself a way of escape.  In effect, however, I admitted  the existence of the \"monster.\" My article was warmly discussed, which  procured it a high reputation.  It rallied round it a certain number of  partisans.  The solution it proposed gave, at least, full liberty to  the imagination.  The human mind delights in grand conceptions of  supernatural beings.  And the sea is precisely their best vehicle, the  only medium through which these giants (against which terrestrial  animals, such as elephants or rhinoceroses, are as nothing) can be  produced or developed.    The industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly from  this point of view.  The Shipping and Mercantile Gazette, the Lloyd's  List, the Packet-Boat, and the Maritime and Colonial Review, all papers  devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their rates of  premium, were unanimous on this point.  Public opinion had been  pronounced.  The United States were the first in the field; and in New  York they made preparations for an expedition destined to pursue this  narwhal.  A frigate of great speed, the Abraham Lincoln, was put in  commission as soon as possible.  The arsenals were opened to Commander  Farragut, who hastened the arming of his frigate; but, as it always  happens, the moment it was decided to pursue the monster, the monster  did not appear.  For two months no one heard it spoken of.  No ship met  with it.  It seemed as if this unicorn knew of the plots weaving around  it.  It had been so much talked of, even through the Atlantic cable,  that jesters pretended that this slender fly had stopped a telegram on  its passage and was making the most of it.    So when the frigate had been armed for a long campaign, and provided  with formidable fishing apparatus, no one could tell what course to  pursue.  Impatience grew apace, when, on the 2nd of July, they learned  that a steamer of the line of San Francisco, from California to  Shanghai, had seen the animal three weeks before in the North Pacific  Ocean.  The excitement caused by this news was extreme.  The ship was  revictualled and well stocked with coal.    Three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left Brooklyn pier, I received a  letter worded as follows:    To M. ARONNAX, Professor in the Museum of Paris, Fifth Avenue Hotel,  New York.    SIR,--If you will consent to join the Abraham Lincoln in this  expedition, the Government of the United States will with pleasure see  France represented in the enterprise.  Commander Farragut has a cabin  at your disposal.    Very cordially yours, J.B. HOBSON, Secretary of Marine.        CHAPTER III    I FORM MY RESOLUTION    Three seconds before the arrival of J. B. Hobson's letter I no more  thought of pursuing the unicorn than of attempting the passage of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16410"],[0,"The Life-Story of Insects (#2)"],[1,"_e_) unable to move from place to place, and  taking no food.    [1] The term _larva_ is applied to any young animal which differs  markedly from its parent.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.

After Lyonet from Miall and  Denny's _Cockroach_.]    Such, in brief, is the course of the most familiar of insect  life-stories. For the student of the animal world as a whole, this  familiar transformation raises some startling problems, which have been  suggestively treated by F. Brauer (1869), L.C. Miall (1895), J. Lubbock  (1874), R. Heymons (1907), P. Deegener (1909) and other writers[2]. To  appreciate these problems is the first step towards learning the true  meaning of the transformation.    [2] The dates in brackets after authors' names will facilitate reference  to the Bibliography (pp. 124-8).    The butterfly's egg is absolutely and relatively of large size, and  contains a considerable amount of yolk. As a rule we find that young  animals hatched from such eggs resemble their parents rather closely and  pass through no marked changes during their lives. A chicken, a  crocodile, a dogfish, a cuttlefish, and a spider afford well-known  examples of this rule. Land-animals, generally, produce young which are  miniature copies of themselves, for example horses, dogs, and other  mammals, snails and slugs, scorpions and earthworms. On the other hand,  metamorphosis among animals is associated with eggs of small size, with  aquatic habit, and with relatively low zoological rank. The young of a  starfish, for example, has hardly a character in common with its parent,  while a marine segmented worm and an oyster, unlike enough when adult,  develop from closely similar larval forms. If we take a class of  animals, the Crustacea, nearly allied to insects, we find that its more  lowly members, such as 'water-fleas' and barnacles, pass through far  more striking changes than its higher groups, such as lobsters and  woodlice. But among the Insects, a class of predominantly terrestrial  and aerial creatures producing large eggs, the highest groups undergo,  as we shall see, the most profound changes. The life-story of the  butterfly, then, well-known as it may be, furnishes a puzzling exception  to some wide-reaching generalisations concerning animal development. And  the student of science often finds that an exception to some rule is the  key to a problem of the highest interest.    During many centuries naturalists have bent their energies to explain  the difficulties presented by insect transformations. Aristotle, the  first serious student of organised beings whose writings have been  preserved for us, and William Harvey, the famous demonstrator of the  mammalian blood circulation two thousand years later, agreed in  regarding the pupa as a second egg. The egg laid by a butterfly had not,  according to Harvey, enough store of food to provide for the building-up  of a complex organism like the parent; only the imperfect larva could be  produced from it. The larva was regarded as feeding voraciously for the  purpose of acquiring a large store of nutritive material, after which it  was believed to revert to the state of a second but far larger egg, the  pupa, from which the winged insect could take origin. Others again,  following de Reaumur (1734), have speculated whether the development of  pupa within larva, and of winged insect within pupa might not be  explained as abnormal births. But a comparison of the transformation of  butterflies with simpler insect life-stories will convince the enquirer  that no such heroic theories as these are necessary. It will be realised  that even the most profound transformation among insects can be  explained as a special case of growth.          CHAPTER II    GROWTH AND CHANGE      The caterpillar differs markedly from the butterfly. As we pursue our  studies of insect growth and transformation we shall find that in some  cases the difference between young and adult is much greater--as for  example between the maggot and the house-fly, in others far less--as  between the young and full-grown grasshopper or plant-bug. It is  evidently wise to begin a general survey of the subject with some of  those simpler cases in which the differences between the young and  adult insect are comparatively slight. We shall then be in a position to  understand better the meaning of the more puzzling and complex cases in  which the differences between the stages are profound.    In the first place it is necessary to realise that the changes which any  insect passes through during its life-story are essentially  accompaniments of its growth. The limits of this little book allow only  slight reference to features of internal structure; we must be content,  in the main, to deal with the outward form. But there is an important  relation between this outward form and the underlying living tissues  which must be clearly understood. Throughout the great race of  animals--the Arthropoda--of which insects form a class, the body is  covered outwardly by a _cuticle_ or secretion of the underlying layer of  living cells which form the outer skin or _epidermis_[3] (see fig. 10  _ep_, _cu_, p. 39). This cuticle has regions which are hard and firm,  forming an _exoskeleton_, and, between these, areas which are relatively  soft and flexible. The firm regions are commonly segmental in their  arrangement, and the intervening flexible connections render possible  accurate motions of the exoskeletal parts in relation to each other,  the motions being due to the contraction of muscles which are attached  within the exoskeleton.    [3] The term 'hypodermis' frequently applied to this layer is  misleading. The layer is the true outer skin--ectoderm or epidermis.    Now this jointed exoskeleton--an admirably formed suit of armour though  it often is--has one drawback: it is not part of the insect's living  tissues. It is a cuticle formed by the solidifying of a fluid secreted  by the epidermal cells, therefore without life, without the power of  growth, and with only a limited capacity for stretching. It follows,  therefore, that at least during the period through which the insect  continues to grow, the cuticle must be periodically shed. Thus in the  life-story of an insect or other arthropod, such as a lobster, a spider,  or a centipede, there must be a succession of cuticle-castings--'moults'  or _ecdyses_ as they are often called.    When such a moult is about to take place the cuticle separates from the  underlying epidermis, and a fluid collects beneath. A delicate new  cuticle (see fig. 10 _cu'_) is then formed in contact with the  epidermis, and the old cuticle opens, usually with a slit lengthwise  along the back, to allow the insect in its new coat to emerge. At first  this new coat is thin and flabby, but after a period of exposure to the  air it hardens and darkens, becoming a worthy and larger successor to  that which has been cast. The cuticle moreover is by no means wholly  external. The greater part of the digestive canal and the whole  air-tube system are formed by inpushings of the outer skin (ectoderm)  and are consequently lined with an extension of the chitinous cuticle  which is shed and renewed at every moult.    In all insects these successive moults tend to be associated with change  of form, sometimes slight, sometimes very great. The new cuticle is  rarely an exact reproduction of the old one, it exhibits some new  features, which are often indications of the insect's approach towards  maturity. Even in some of those interesting and primitive insects the  Bristle-tails (Thysanura) and Spring-tails (Collembola), in which wings  are never developed, perceptible differences in the form and arrangement  of the abdominal limbs can be traced through the successive stages, as  R. Heymons (1906) and K.W. Verhoeff (1911) have shown for Machilis. But  the changes undergone by such insects are comparatively so slight, that  the creatures are often known as 'Ametabola' or insects without  transformation in the life-history. Now there are a considerable number  of winged insects--cockroaches and grasshoppers for example--in which  the observable changes are also comparatively slight. We will sketch  briefly the main features of the life-story of such an insect.    [Illustration: Fig. 4. Common Cockroach (_Blatta orientalis_). _a_,  female; _b_, male; _c_, side view of female; _d_, young. After Marlatt,  _Entom. Bull._ 4, _U.S. Dept. Agric._]    The young creature is hatched from the egg in a form closely resembling,  on the whole, that of its parent, so that the term 'miniature adult'  sometimes applied to it, is not inappropriate. The baby cockroach (fig.  4 _d_) is known by its flattened body, rounded prothorax, and stiff,  jointed tail-feelers or cercopods; the baby grasshopper by its strong,  elongate hind-legs, adapted, like those of the adult, for vigorous  leaping. During the growth of the insect to the adult state there may be  four or five moults, each preceded and succeeded by a characteristic  instar[4]. The first instar differs, however, from the adult in one  conspicuous and noteworthy feature, it possesses no trace of wings. But  after the first or the second moult, definite wing-rudiments are visible  in the form of outgrowths on the corners of the second and third  thoracic segments. In each succeeding instar these rudiments become more  prominent, and in the fourth or the fifth stage, they show a branching  arrangement of air-tubes, prefiguring the nervures of the adult's wing  (fig. 5). After the last moult the wings are exposed, articulated to the  segments that bear them, and capable of motion. Having been formed  beneath the cuticle of the wing-rudiments of the penultimate instar, the  wings are necessarily abbreviated and crumpled."]]]
