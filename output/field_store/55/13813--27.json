Because God  does this, we will, of course, want to forgive from our hearts and  willingly do good to those who sin against us.    The Sixth Request    And lead us not into temptation. (Matthew 6:12)    What does this mean?    God tempts no one, of course, but we pray in this request that God will  protect us and save us, so that the Devil, the world and our bodily  desires will neither deceive us nor seduce us into heresy, despair or  other serious shame or vice, and so that we will win and be victorious  in the end, even if they attack us.    The Seventh Request    But set us free from the Evil One. ( Matthew 6:12)    What does this mean?    We pray in this request, as a summary, that our Father in Heaven will  save us from every kind of evil that threatens body, soul, property and  honor. We pray that when at last our final hour has come, He will grant  us a blessed death, and, in His grace, bring us to Himself from this  valley of tears.  Amen    What does this mean?    That I should be certain that such prayers are acceptable to the Father  in Heaven and will be granted, that He Himself has commanded us to pray  in this way and that He promises to answer us. Amen. Amen. This means:  Yes, yes it will happen this way.    IV. The Sacrament of Holy Baptism  The Simple Way a Father Should Present it to His Household    What is Baptism?    Baptism is not just plain water, but it is water contained within God's  command and united with God's Word.    Where in the Word of God is this?    Where our Lord Christ spoke in the last chapter of Matthew (Matthew  28:19):  \"Go into all the world, teaching all heathen nations, and baptizing  them in the name of the Father, the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\"    What does Baptism give? What good is it?    It gives us the forgiveness of sins, redeems us from death and the  Devil, and gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, just as  God's words and promises declare.    What are these words and promises of God?    Our Lord Christ spoke one of them in the last chapter of Mark (Mark  16:16):  \"Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved; but whoever does not  believe will be damned.\"    How can water do such great things?    Water doesn't make these things happen, of course. It is God's Word,  which is with and in the water. Because, without God's Word, the water  is plain water and not baptism. But with God's Word it is a Baptism, a  grace-filled water of life, a bath of new birth in the Holy Spirit, as  St. Paul said to Titus in the third chapter (Titus 3:5-8):  \"Through this bath of rebirth and renewal of the Holy Spirit, which He  poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ, our Savior, that we,  justified by the same grace are made heirs according to the hope of  eternal life. This is a faithful saying.\"    What is the meaning of such a water Baptism?    It means that the old Adam in us should be drowned by daily sorrow and  repentance, and die with all sins and evil lusts, and, in turn, a new  person daily come forth and rise from death again. He will live forever  before God in righteousness and purity.    Where is this written?    St. Paul says to the Romans in Chapter Six (Romans 6:4):  \"We are buried with Christ through Baptism into death, so that, in the  same way Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, thus  also must we walk in a new life.\"    V. How You Should Teach the Uneducated to Confess    What is confession?    Confession has two parts: First, a person admits his sin Second, a  person receives absolution or forgiveness from the confessor, as if  from God Himself, without doubting it, but believing firmly that his  sins are forgiven by God in Heaven through it.    Which sins should people confess?    When speaking to God, we should plead guilty to all sins, even those we  don't know about, just as we do in the \"Our Father,\" but when speaking  to the confessor, only the sins we know about, which we know about and  feel in our hearts.    Which are these?    Consider here your place in life according to the Ten Commandments. Are  you a father? A mother? A son? A daughter? A husband? A wife? A  servant? Are you disobedient, unfaithful or lazy? Have you hurt anyone  with your words or actions? Have you stolen, neglected your duty, let  things go or injured someone?    Please suggest to me a simple way to confess.    You should speak to your confessor this way:    Honorable, dear Sir: Would you please hear my confession and pronounce  forgiveness according to God's will.    He will respond: Yes. Please go ahead.    Then say:  I confess in the presence of God that I am a poor sinner and guilty of  every kind of sin. I specifically admit to you that I am a servant,  maid, etc., but I'm afraid that I have served my master unfaithfully.  >From time to time, I have not done what I was told to do. I have  angered them and caused them to swear at me. I have neglected my duty  and allowed damage to be done. My words and actions have been shameful.  I have been angry with my peers. I have complained about my master's  wife and sworn at her, etc. I am sorry for all of this and ask for  grace. I want to do better.    A master or a lady of the house should speak this way:  I specifically confess to you that I have not faithfully led my  children, servants or wife to God's glory. I have cursed. I have set a  bad example with my obscene words and actions. I have hurt my neighbor  and spoken evil things about him. I have charged him too much, cheated  him and sold him badly made goods.    Let him also confess any other sins against God's commandments and his  place in life, etc.    If a person is not burdened with sins such as these or greater sins, he  should not look for other sins or invent them, because that would turn  confession into torture. Instead, he should mention one or two that he  knows about. For example: specifically I confess that I once cursed.  Once I used inappropriate language. Once I neglected to do this or that  thing, etc. Let that be enough.    If you do not know of anything you have done wrong (which does not seem  possible), do not say anything in specific, but receive forgiveness  based upon the general confession you make to God in the presence of  your confessor.    After this, the Confessor will say:  May God be merciful to you and strengthen your faith!    Then he will ask:  Do you also believe that the forgiveness I give is God's forgiveness?    Then you will answer:  Yes, dear sir.    After this, he will say:  May what you believe happen to you. And by the command of my Lord  Jesus, I forgive your sins in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy  Spirit. Amen. Go in peace! The confessor will know how to use  additional passages to comfort and to encourage the faith of those who  sorrow, are troubled or whose conscience is greatly burdened. This is  only meant to be a general confession for the uneducated.    VI. The Sacrament of the Altar  The Simple Way a Father Should Present it to his Household    What is the Sacrament of the Altar?    It is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ under bread and  wine for us Christians to eat and to drink, established by Christ  Himself.    Where is that written?    The holy apostles Matthew, Mark and Luke and St. Paul write this:  \"Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the night on which He was betrayed, took  bread, gave thanks, broke it, gave it to His disciples and said: 'Take!  Eat! This is My body, which is given for you. Do this to remember Me!'  In the same way He also took the cup after supper, gave thanks, gave it  to them, and said: 'Take and drink from it, all of you! This cup is the  New Testament in my blood, which is shed for you to forgive sins. This  do, as often as you drink it, to remember Me!'\"    What good does this eating and drinking do?    These words tell us: \"Given for you\" and \"Shed for you to forgive  sins.\" Namely, that the forgiveness of sins, life and salvation are  given to us through these words in the sacrament. Because, where sins  are forgiven, there is life and salvation as well.    How can physical eating and drinking do such great things?    Of course, eating and drinking do not do these things. These words,  written here, do them: \"given for you\" and \"shed for you to forgive  sins.\" These words, along with physical eating and drinking are the  important part of the sacrament. Anyone who believes these words has  what they say and what they record, namely, the forgiveness of sins.    Who, then, receives such a sacrament in a worthy way?    Of course, fasting and other physical preparations are excellent  disciplines for the body. But anyone who believes these words, \"Given  for you,\" and \"Shed for you to forgive sins,\" is really worthy and well  prepared. But whoever doubts or does not believe these words is not  worthy and is unprepared, because the words, \"for you\" demand a heart  that fully believes.    Appendix I  How a Father Should Teach His Household  to Conduct Morning and Evening Devotions.    Morning Devotions    As soon as you get out of bed in the morning, you should bless yourself  with the sign of the Holy Cross and say:    May the will of God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be done!  Amen.  Then, kneeling or standing, say the creed and pray the Lord's Prayer.  If you wish, you may then pray this little prayer as well:  My Heavenly Father, I thank You, through Jesus Christ, Your beloved  Son, that You kept me safe from all evil and danger last night. Save  me, I pray, that you will keep me safe today from every evil and sin as  well,, so that all I do and the way that I live will please you. I put  myself in your care, body and soul and all that I have. Let Your holy  Angels be with me, so that the evil enemy will not gain power over me.  Amen.  After that, with joy go about your work and perhaps sing a song  inspired by the Ten"]]]
