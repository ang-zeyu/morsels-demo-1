[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16726"],[0,"Four Weird Tales (#2)"],[1,"was a moment  of genuine terror when their eyes had met through the glass door, and  he was conscious of an inward shrinking and loathing that seized upon  him with great violence and convinced him in a single second that the  settling of this account would be almost, perhaps, more than he could  manage.    The vision passed as swiftly as it came, dropping back again into the  submerged region of his consciousness; but he never forgot it, and  the whole of his life thereafter became a sort of natural though  undeliberate preparation for the fulfilment of the great duty when the  time should be ripe.    In those days--ten years ago--this man was the Assistant Manager,  but had since been promoted as Manager to one of the company's local  branches; and soon afterwards Jones had likewise found himself  transferred to this same branch. A little later, again, the branch  at Liverpool, one of the most important, had been in peril owing to  mismanagement and defalcation, and the man had gone to take charge of  it, and again, by mere chance apparently, Jones had been promoted to the  same place. And this pursuit of the Assistant Manager had continued for  several years, often, too, in the most curious fashion; and though Jones  had never exchanged a single word with him, or been so much as noticed  indeed by the great man, the clerk understood perfectly well that these  moves in the game were all part of a definite purpose. Never for one  moment did he doubt that the Invisibles behind the veil were slowly and  surely arranging the details of it all so as to lead up suitably to the  climax demanded by justice, a climax in which himself and the Manager  would play the leading _roles_.    \"It is inevitable,\" he said to himself, \"and I feel it may be terrible;  but when the moment comes I shall be ready, and I pray God that I may  face it properly and act like a man.\"    Moreover, as the years passed, and nothing happened, he felt the horror  closing in upon him with steady increase, for the fact was Jones hated  and loathed the Manager with an intensity of feeling he had never before  experienced towards any human being. He shrank from his presence, and  from the glance of his eyes, as though he remembered to have suffered  nameless cruelties at his hands; and he slowly began to realise,  moreover, that the matter to be settled between them was one of very  ancient standing, and that the nature of the settlement was a discharge  of accumulated punishment which would probably be very dreadful in the  manner of its fulfilment.    When, therefore, the chief cashier one day informed him that the man  was to be in London again--this time as General Manager of the head  office--and said that he was charged to find a private secretary for him  from among the best clerks, and further intimated that the selection  had fallen upon himself, Jones accepted the promotion quietly,  fatalistically, yet with a degree of inward loathing hardly to be  described. For he saw in this merely another move in the evolution of  the inevitable Nemesis which he simply dared not seek to frustrate by  any personal consideration; and at the same time he was conscious of a  certain feeling of relief that the suspense of waiting might soon be  mitigated. A secret sense of satisfaction, therefore, accompanied the  unpleasant change, and Jones was able to hold himself perfectly well in  hand when it was carried into effect and he was formally introduced as  private secretary to the General Manager.    Now the Manager was a large, fat man, with a very red face and bags  beneath his eyes. Being short-sighted, he wore glasses that seemed to  magnify his eyes, which were always a little bloodshot. In hot weather a  sort of thin slime covered his cheeks, for he perspired easily. His head  was almost entirely bald, and over his turn-down collar his great neck  folded in two distinct reddish collops of flesh. His hands were big and  his fingers almost massive in thickness.    He was an excellent business man, of sane judgment and firm will,  without enough imagination to confuse his course of action by showing  him possible alternatives; and his integrity and ability caused him to  be held in universal respect by the world of business and finance. In  the important regions of a man's character, however, and at heart, he  was coarse, brutal almost to savagery, without consideration for others,  and as a result often cruelly unjust to his helpless subordinates.    In moments of temper, which were not infrequent, his face turned a dull  purple, while the top of his bald head shone by contrast like white  marble, and the bags under his eyes swelled till it seemed they would  presently explode with a pop. And at these times he presented a  distinctly repulsive appearance.    But to a private secretary like Jones, who did his duty regardless of  whether his employer was beast or angel, and whose mainspring was  principle and not emotion, this made little difference. Within the  narrow limits in which any one _could_ satisfy such a man, he pleased  the General Manager; and more than once his piercing intuitive faculty,  amounting almost to clairvoyance, assisted the chief in a fashion that  served to bring the two closer together than might otherwise have  been the case, and caused the man to respect in his assistant a power  of which he possessed not even the germ himself. It was a curious  relationship that grew up between the two, and the cashier, who enjoyed  the credit of having made the selection, profited by it indirectly as  much as any one else.    So for some time the work of the office continued normally and very  prosperously. John Enderby Jones received a good salary, and in the  outward appearance of the two chief characters in this history there  was little change noticeable, except that the Manager grew fatter and  redder, and the secretary observed that his own hair was beginning to  show rather greyish at the temples.    There were, however, two changes in progress, and they both had to do  with Jones, and are important to mention.    One was that he began to dream evilly. In the region of deep sleep,  where the possibility of significant dreaming first develops itself, he  was tormented more and more with vivid scenes and pictures in which a  tall thin man, dark and sinister of countenance, and with bad eyes, was  closely associated with himself. Only the setting was that of a past  age, with costumes of centuries gone by, and the scenes had to do with  dreadful cruelties that could not belong to modern life as he knew it.    The other change was also significant, but is not so easy to describe,  for he had in fact become aware that some new portion of himself,  hitherto unawakened, had stirred slowly into life out of the very depths  of his consciousness. This new part of himself amounted almost to  another personality, and he never observed its least manifestation  without a strange thrill at his heart.    For he understood that it had begun to _watch_ the Manager!          II      It was the habit of Jones, since he was compelled to work among  conditions that were utterly distasteful, to withdraw his mind wholly  from business once the day was over. During office hours he kept the  strictest possible watch upon himself, and turned the key on all inner  dreams, lest any sudden uprush from the deeps should interfere with his  duty. But, once the working day was over, the gates flew open, and he  began to enjoy himself.    He read no modern books on the subjects that interested him, and, as  already said, he followed no course of training, nor belonged to any  society that dabbled with half-told mysteries; but, once released from  the office desk in the Manager's room, he simply and naturally entered  the other region, because he was an old inhabitant, a rightful denizen,  and because he belonged there. It was, in fact, really a case of  dual personality; and a carefully drawn agreement existed between  Jones-of-the-fire-insurance-office and Jones-of-the-mysteries, by the  terms of which, under heavy penalties, neither region claimed him out of  hours.    For the moment he reached his rooms under the roof in Bloomsbury, and  had changed his city coat to another, the iron doors of the office  clanged far behind him, and in front, before his very eyes, rolled up  the beautiful gates of ivory, and he entered into the places of flowers  and singing and wonderful veiled forms. Sometimes he quite lost touch  with the outer world, forgetting to eat his dinner or go to bed, and lay  in a state of trance, his consciousness working far out of the body. And  on other occasions he walked the streets on air, half-way between the  two regions, unable to distinguish between incarnate and discarnate  forms, and not very far, probably, beyond the strata where poets,  saints, and the greatest artists have moved and thought and found their  inspiration. But this was only when some insistent bodily claim  prevented his full release, and more often than not he was entirely  independent of his physical portion and free of the real region, without  let or hindrance.    One evening he reached home utterly exhausted after the burden of the  day's work. The Manager had been more than usually brutal, unjust,  ill-tempered, and Jones had been almost persuaded out of his settled  policy of contempt into answering back. Everything seemed to have gone  amiss, and the man's coarse, underbred nature had been in the ascendant  all day long: he had thumped the desk with his great fists, abused,  found fault unreasonably, uttered outrageous things, and behaved  generally as he actually was--beneath the thin veneer of acquired  business varnish. He had done and said everything to wound all that was  woundable in an ordinary secretary, and though Jones fortunately dwelt  in a region from which he looked down upon such a man as he might look  down on the blundering of a savage"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16728"],[0,"A Catechism of Familiar Things; (#2)"],[1,"a  secret process peculiar to itself. Fish, too, and all cold-blooded  amphibious animals are gifted with the same power.         _Decomposing_, separating a mixed body into its several       parts.         _Amphibious_, able to live both in water and out of it.      Of what use is this power to vegetables?    The water which they decompose affords them nourishment for the  support of their vital juices, and enables them, by combining the  fluid gases which compose it with those of the air and the soil, to  form their different products; while the superfluous gas is abundantly  given out by their leaves, to refresh the spent air, and render it  wholesome for the animals that breathe it.         _Vital_, belonging to life, necessary to existence.         _Superfluous_, unnecessary, not wanted.      What is Rain?    The condensed aqueous vapors raised in the atmosphere by the sun and  wind, converted into clouds, which fall in rain, snow, hail, or mist:  their falling is occasioned by their own weight in a collision  produced by contrary currents of wind, from the clouds passing into a  colder part of the air, or by electricity. If the vapors are more  copious, and rise a little higher, they form a mist or fog, which is  visible to the eye; higher still they produce rain. Hence we may  account for the changes of the weather: why a cold summer is always a  wet one--a warm, a dry one.         _Aqueous_, watery; consisting of water.         _Collision_, a striking together, a clash, a meeting.         _Electricity_, a natural agent existing in all bodies (see       page 18).      What seasons are more liable to rain than others?    The Spring and Autumn are generally the most rainy seasons, the vapors  _rise_ more plentifully in Spring; and in the Autumn, as the sun  recedes from us and the cold increases, the vapors, which lingered  above us during the summer heats, _fall_ more easily.         _Recede_, to fall back, to retreat.      What is Snow?    Rain congealed by cold in the atmosphere, which causes it to fall to  the earth in white flakes. Snow fertilizes the ground by defending the  roots of plants from the intenser cold of the air and the piercing  winds.         _Congealed_, turned by the force of cold from a fluid to a       solid state; hardened.         _Fertilize_, to render fruitful.         _Intenser_, raised to a higher degree, more powerful.      What is Hail?    Drops of rain frozen in their passage through cold air. Hail assumes  various figures according to the degrees of heat or cold through which  it passes, being sometimes round, flat, &c.      What is the Atmosphere?    The mass of aeriform fluid which encompasses the earth on all sides:  it extends about fifty miles above its surface. Air is the elastic  fluid of which it is composed.         _Elastic_, having the power of springing back, or recovering       its former figure after the removal of any external pressure       which has altered that figure. When the force which       compresses the air is removed, it expands and resumes its       former state.      What are the uses of air?    It is necessary to the well-being of man, since without it neither he  nor any animal or vegetable could exist. If it were not for  atmospheric air, we should be unable to converse with each other; we  should know nothing of sound or smell; or of the pleasures which arise  from the variegated prospects which surround us: it is to the presence  of air and carbonic acid that water owes its agreeable taste. Boiling  deprives it of the greater part of these, and renders it insipid.         _Variegated_, diversified, changed; adorned with different       colors.         _Insipid_, tasteless.      What is Wind?    Air in motion with any degree of velocity.      What is Lightning?    The effect of electricity in the clouds. A flash of lightning is  simply a stream of the electric fluid passing from the clouds to the  earth, from the earth to the clouds, or from one cloud to another.  Lightning usually strikes the highest and most pointed objects, as  high hills, trees, spires, masts of ships, &c.      What is Thunder?    The report which accompanies the electrical union of the clouds: or  the echoes of the report between them and the earth. Thunder is caused  by a sudden discharge of electrical matter collected in the air, by  which vibrations are produced, which give rise to the sound.      What is Electricity?    One of those agents passing through the earth and all substances,  without giving any outward signs of its presence, when at rest; yet  when active, often producing violent and destructive effects. It is  _supposed_ to be a highly elastic fluid, capable of moving through  matter. Clouds owe their form and existence, probably, to it; and it  passes through all substances, but more easily through metals, water,  the human body, &c., which are called conductors, than through air,  glass, and silk, which are called _non_-conductors. When bodies are  not surrounded with non-conductors, the electricity escapes quickly  into the earth.      To what part of bodies is Electricity confined?    To their surfaces, as the outside may be electric, and the inside in a  state of neutrality. The heat produced by an electric shock is very  powerful, but is only accompanied by light when the fluid is  obstructed in its passage. The production and condensation of vapor is  a great source of the atmospheric electricity.         _Condensation_, the act of making any body dense or compact;       that is, of bringing its parts into closer union.      In what other sense is the term Electricity employed?    This term is also employed to designate that important branch of  knowledge which relates to the properties shown by certain bodies when  rubbed against, or otherwise brought in contact with, each other, to  attract substances, and emit sparks of fire.         _Designate_, to point out by some particular token.         _Emit_, to send forth, to throw out.    [Illustration: CUTTING AND GATHERING ICE, ON THE HUDSON RIVER, NEW  YORK.]      Whence is the word derived?    From _electron_, the Greek word for amber, a yellow transparent  substance, remarkable for its electrical power when rubbed: amber is  of a resinous nature, and is collected from the sea-shore, or dug from  the earth, in many parts of the world. It is employed in the  manufacture of beads and other toys, on account of its transparency;  is of some use in medicine, and in the making of varnishes.         _Transparent_, clear, capable of being seen through.         _Resinous_, containing resin, a gummy vegetable juice.      Name a few substances possessing this remarkable property.    Silks of all kinds; the hair and fur of animals, paper, sulphur, and  some other minerals; most of the precious stones; the paste of which  false gems are made; and many other substances used by us in the  common affairs of life, are susceptible of electrical excitement;  among domestic animals the cat furnishes a remarkable instance. When  dry and warm, the back of almost any full-grown cat (the darker its  color the better) can be excited by rubbing it with the hand in the  direction of the hair, a process which is accompanied with a slight  snapping noise, and in the dark by flashes of pale blue light. When a  piece of glass is rubbed with silk, or a stick of red sealing-wax with  woollen cloth, each substance acquires the property of attracting and  repelling feathers, straws, threads of cotton, and other light  substances; the substances just mentioned as highly electric are,  however, merely specimens. All objects, without exception, most  probably are capable of being electrically excited; but some require  more complicated contrivances to produce it than others.         _Electric_, having the properties of electricity.         _Susceptible_, disposed to admit easily.         _Repelling_, the act of driving back.         _Complicated_, formed by the union of several parts in one.      Is there not a machine by which we are enabled to obtain large  supplies of electric power at pleasure?    Yes; the electrical machine. It is made of different forms and sizes:  for common purposes those of the simplest form are the best. A common  form of the machine consists of a circular plate of glass, which can  be turned about a horizontal axis by means of a suitable handle. This  plate turns between two supports, and near its upper and lower edges  are two pairs of cushions, usually made of leather, stuffed with  horse-hair and coated with a mixture of zinc, tin, and mercury, called  an _amalgam_. These cushions are the rubbers for producing friction,  and are connected with the earth by means of a metal chain or rod. Two  large hollow cylinders of brass with globular ends, each supported by  two glass pillars, constitute the reservoir for receiving the  electricity. They are called the _prime conductors_, and are supplied  with U-shaped rods of metal, furnished with points along their sides,  called _combs_, for the purpose of receiving the electricity from the  glass plate, the arms of the U being held upon either side. The other  ends of the conductors are connected by a rod from the middle of which  projects another rod terminating in a knob, for delivering the spark.    On turning the plate, a faint snapping sound is heard, and when the  room is darkened, a spark is seen to be thrown out from the knob  projecting from the _prime conductors_.    Many curious and interesting experiments may be performed by means of  the machine, illustrating the general properties of electricity. For  instance: a person standing on an insulated bench, that is, a bench  with glass legs, or having the legs resting on glass, and having one  hand on the conductor, can send sparks, with the other hand, to  everything and everybody about. This illustrates communication of  electricity by contact. A wooden head, covered with long hairs, when  placed"]]]
