Mr. Westabrook looked about him. \"Getting towards Revere.\"    \"Let's go home through Charlestown,\" Dr. Pierce suggested. \"How  would you like to see the house where I was born, Maida--that old  place on Warrington Street I told you about yesterday. I think you'd  like it, Pinkwink.\"    \"Pinkwink\" was Dr. Pierce's pet-name for Maida.    \"Oh, I'd love to see it.\" A little thrill of pleasure sparkled in  Maida's flat tones. \"I'd just love to.\"    Dr. Pierce gave some directions to the chauffeur.    For fifteen minutes or more the men talked business. They had come  away from the sea and the streams of yellow and red and green trees.  Maida pillowed her head on the cushions and stared fixedly at the  passing streets. But her little face wore a dreamy, withdrawn look  as if she were seeing something very far away. Whenever \"Buffalo\"  Westabrook's glance shot her way, his thick brows pulled together  into the frown that most people dreaded to face.    \"Now down the hill and then to the left,\" Dr. Pierce instructed  Henri.    Warrington Street was wide and old-fashioned. Big elms marching in a  double file between the fine old houses, met in an arch above their  roofs. At intervals along the curbstones were hitching-posts of  iron, most of them supporting the head of a horse with a ring in his  nose. One, the statue of a negro boy with his arms lifted above his  head, seemed to beg the honor of holding the reins. Beside these  hitching-posts were rectangular blocks of granite--stepping-stones  for horseback riders and carriage folk.    \"There, Pinkwink,\" Dr. Pierce said; \"that old house on the  corner--stop here, Henri, please--that's where I was brought up. The  old swing used to hang from that tree and it was from that big bough  stretching over the fence that I fell and broke my arm.\"    Maida's eyes brightened. \"And there's the garret window where the  squirrels used to come in,\" she exclaimed.    \"The same!\" Dr. Pierce laughed. \"You don't forget anything, do you?  My goodness me! How small the house looks and how narrow the street  has grown! Even the trees aren't as tall as they should be.\"    Maida stared. The trees looked very high indeed to her. And she  thought the street quite wide enough for anybody, the houses very  stately.    \"Now show me the school,\" she begged.    \"Just a block or two, Henri,\" Dr. Pierce directed.    The car stopped in front of a low, rambling wooden building with a  yard in front.    \"That's where you covered the ceiling with spit-balls,\" Maida asked.    \"The same!\" Dr. Pierce laughed heartily at the remembrance. It  seemed to Maida that she had never seen his curls bob quite so  furiously before.    \"It's one of the few wooden, primary buildings left in the city,\" he  explained to the two men. \"It can't last many years now. It's  nothing but a rat-trap but how I shall hate to see it go!\"    Opposite the school was a big, wide court. Shaded with beautiful  trees--maples beginning to flame, horse-chestnuts a little browned,  it was lined with wooden toy houses, set back of fenced-in yards and  veiled by climbing vines. Pigeons were flying about, alighting now  and then to peck at the ground or to preen their green and purple  necks. Boys were spinning tops. Girls were jumping rope. The dust  they kicked up had a sweet, earthy smell in Maida's nostrils. As she  stared, charmed with the picture, a little girl in a scarlet cape  and a scarlet hat came climbing up over one of the fences. Quick,  active as a squirrel, she disappeared into the next yard.    \"Primrose Court!\" Dr. Pierce exclaimed. \"Well, well, well!\"    \"Primrose Court,\" Maida repeated. \"Do primroses grow there?\"    \"Bless your heart, no,\" Dr. Pierce laughed; \"it was named after a  man called Primrose who used to own a great deal of the  neighborhood.\"    But Maida was scarcely listening. \"Oh, what a cunning little shop!\"  she exclaimed. \"There, opposite the court. What a perfectly darling  little place!\"    \"Good Lord! that's Connors',\" Dr. Pierce explained. \"Many a reckless  penny I've squandered there, my dear. Connors was the funniest, old,  bent, dried-up man. I wonder who keeps it now.\"    As if in answer to his question, a wrinkled old lady came to the  window to take a paper-doll from the dusty display there.    \"What are those yellow things in that glass jar?\" Maida asked.    \"Pickled limes,\" Dr. Pierce responded promptly. \"How I used to love  them!\"    \"Oh, father, buy me a pickled lime,\" Maida pleaded. \"I never had one  in my life and I've been crazy to taste one ever since I read  'Little Women.'\"    \"All right,\" Mr. Westabrook said. \"Let's come in and treat Maida to  a pickled lime.\"    A bell rang discordantly as they opened the door. Its prolonged  clangor finally brought the old lady from the room at the back. She  looked in surprise at the three men in their automobile coats and at  the little lame girl.    Coming in from the bright sunshine, the shop seemed unpleasantly  dark to Maida. After a while she saw that its two windows gave it  light enough but that it was very confused, cluttery and dusty.    Mr. Westabrook bought four pickled limes and everybody ate--three of  them with enjoyment, Billy with many wry faces and a decided,  \"Stung!\" after the first taste.    \"I like pickled limes,\" Maida said after they had started for  Boston. \"What a funny little place that was! Oh, how I would like to  keep a little shop just like it.\"    Billy Potter started. For a moment it seemed as if he were about to  speak. But instead, he stared hard at Maida, falling gradually into  a brown study. From time to time he came out of it long enough to  look sharply at her. The sparkle had all gone out of her face. She  was pale and dream-absorbed again.    Her father studied her with increasing anxiety as they neared the  big house on Beacon Street. Dr. Pierce's face was shadowed too.    \"Eureka! I've found it!\" Billy exclaimed as they swept past the  State House. \"I've got it, Mr. Westabrook.\"    \"Got what?\"    Billy did not answer at once. The automobile had stopped in front of  a big red-brick house. Over the beautifully fluted columns that held  up the porch hung a brilliant red vine. Lavender-colored glass, here  and there in the windows, made purple patches on the lace of the  curtains.    \"Got what?\" Mr. Westabrook repeated impatiently.    \"That little job of the imagination that you put me on a few moments  ago,\" Billy answered mysteriously. \"In a moment,\" he added with a  significant look at Maida. \"You stay too, Dr. Pierce. I want your  approval.\"    The door of the beautiful old house had opened and a man in livery  came out to assist Maida. On the threshold stood an old  silver-haired woman in a black-silk gown, a white cap and apron, a little  black shawl pinned about her shoulders.    \"How's my lamb?\" she asked tenderly of Maida.    \"Oh, pretty well,\" Maida said dully. \"Oh, Granny,\" she added with a  sudden flare of enthusiasm, \"I saw the cunningest little shop. I  think I'd rather tend shop than do anything else in the world.\"    Billy Potter smiled all over his pink face. He followed Mr.  Westabrook and Dr. Pierce into the drawing-room.                            ----------------------    Maida went upstairs with Granny Flynn.    Granny Flynn had come straight to the Westabrook house from the boat  that brought her from Ireland years ago. She had come to America in  search of a runaway daughter but she had never found her. She had  helped to nurse Maida's mother in the illness of which she died and  she had always taken such care of Maida herself that Maida loved her  dearly. Sometimes when they were alone, Maida would call her \"Dame,\"  because, she said, \"Granny looks just like the 'Dame' who comes into  fairy-tales.\"    Granny Flynn was very little, very bent, very old. \"A t'ousand and  noine, sure,\" she always answered when Maida asked her how old. Her  skin had cracked into a hundred wrinkles and her long sharp nose and  her short sharp chin almost met. But the wrinkles surrounded a pair  of eyes that were a twinkling, youthful blue. And her down-turned  nose and up-growing chin could not conceal or mar the lovely  sweetness of her smile.    Just before Maida went to bed that night, she was surprised by a  visit from her father.    \"Posie,\" he said, sitting down on her bed, \"did you really mean it  to-day when you said you would like to keep a little shop?\"    \"Oh, yes, father! I've been thinking it over ever since I came home  from our ride this afternoon. A little shop, you know, just like the  one we saw to-day.\"    \"Very well, dear, you shall keep a shop. You shall keep that very  one. I'm going to buy out the business for you and put you in charge  there. I've got to be in New York pretty steadily for the next three  months and I've decided that I'll send you and Granny to live in the  rooms over the shop. I'll fix the place all up for you, give you  plenty of money to stock it and then I expect you to run it and make  it pay.\"    Maida sat up in bed with a vigor that surprised her father. She  shook her hands--a gesture that, with her, meant great delight. She  laughed. It was the first time in months that a happy note had  pealed in her laughter. \"Oh, father, dear, how good you are to me!  I'm just crazy to try it and I know I can make it pay--if hard work  helps.\"    \"All right. That's settled. But listen carefully to what I'm going  to say, Posie. I can't have this getting into the papers, you know.  To prevent that, you're to play a game while you're working in the  shop--just as princesses in fairy-tales had to play games sometimes.  You're going _in disguise_. Do you understand?\"    \"Yes, father, I understand.\"    \"You're to pretend that you belong to Granny Flynn, that you're her  grandchild. You won't have to tell any lies about it.

The third source of her success lay in the spirit of her population.  Like Rome in her early days, she was never cast down by reverses.  Misfortune only nerved her to further exertions, and after each defeat  she rose stronger than before. But the cause which, more than all,  contributed to give to Venice her ascendancy among the cities of Italy,  was her form of government. Democratic at first, as among all  communities, it had gradually assumed the character of a close  oligarchy, and although nominally ruled by a council containing a large  number of members, her destinies were actually in the hands of the  Doge, elected for life, and the Council of Ten, chosen from the great  body of the council. Thus she had from the first been free from those  factions which were the bane of Genoa and Florence. Some of the great  families had from time to time come more prominently to the front than  others, but none had attained predominant political power, and beyond a  few street tumults of slight importance, Venice had not suffered from  the popular tumults and uprisings which played so prominent a part in  the history of her rivals.    Thus, undisturbed by discord at home, Venice had been able to give all  her attention and all her care to her interests abroad, and her  affairs, conducted as they were by her wisest citizens, with a single  eye to the benefit of the state, had been distinguished by a rare  sagacity. Her object had been single and uniform, to protect her own  interests, and to prevent any one city on the mainland attaining such a  preponderance as would render her a dangerous neighbour. Hence she was  always ready to ally herself with the weaker against the stronger, and  to aid with money and men any state struggling against an ambitious  neighbour. Acting on this principle she by turns assisted Padua against  Verona, and Verona against Padua, or either of them when threatened by  the growing power of Milan, and at the end of a war she generally came  out with an increased territory, and added importance.    It is probable that no community was ever governed, for hundreds of  years, with such uniform wisdom and sagacity as was Venice; but the  advantage was not without drawbacks. The vigilance of the Council of  Ten in repressing plots, not unfrequently set on foot by the enemies of  the republic, resulted in the adoption of a hateful system of  espionage. The city was pervaded with spies, and even secret  denunciations were attended to, and the slightest expression of  discontent against the ruling authorities was severely punished. On the  other hand, comparatively slight attention was paid to private crime.  Assassinations were of frequent occurrence, and unless the victim  happened to be very powerfully connected, no notice was taken when a  man was found to be missing from his usual place, and his corpse was  discovered floating in the lagoon. Consequently crimes of this kind  were, in the great majority of cases, committed with impunity, and even  when traced, the authors, if possessed of powerful protectors, seldom  suffered any greater punishment than temporary banishment.    After standing for some time on the Piazzetta, the two lads turned and,  entering the square of Saint Mark, mingled with the crowd. It was a  motley one. Nobles in silks and satins jostled with fishermen of the  lagoons. Natives of all the coasts and islands which owned the sway of  Venice, Greeks from Constantinople, Tartar merchants from the Crimea,  Tyrians, and inhabitants of the islands of the Aegean, were present in  considerable numbers; while among the crowd, vendors of fruit and  flowers from the mainland, and of fresh water or cooling drinks, sold  their wares. The English lad's companion--Matteo Giustiniani--belonged  to one of the leading families of Venice, and was able to name to  Francis most of the nobles and persons of importance whom they passed.    \"There is Pisani,\" he said. \"Of course you know him. What a jolly,  good-tempered looking fellow he is! The sailors would do anything for  him, and they say he will have command of the next fleet that puts to  sea. I wish I was going with him. There is sure to be a fierce fight  when he comes across the Genoese. His father was one of our greatest  admirals.    \"That noble just behind him is Fiofio Dandolo. What a grand family they  have been, what a number of great men they have given to the republic!  I should like to have seen the grand old Doge who stormed the walls of  Constantinople, and divided the Eastern empire among the crusading  barons. He was a hero indeed.    \"No; I don't know who that young noble in the green velvet cap and plum  coloured dress is. O yes, I do, though; it is Ruggiero Mocenigo; he has  been away for the last two years at Constantinople; he was banished for  having killed Polo Morosini--he declared it was in fair fight, but no  one believed him. They had quarrelled a few days before over some  question of the precedence of their families, and Morosini was found  dead at the top of the steps close to the church of Saint Paolo. Some  people heard a cry and ran up just as Mocenigo leapt into his gondola,  but as it rowed off their shouts called the attention of one of the  city guard boats which happened to be passing, and it was stopped. As  his sword was still wet with blood, he could not deny that he was the  author of the deed, but, as I said, he declared it was in fair fight.  The Morosinis asserted that Polo's sword was undrawn, but the Mocenigo  family brought forward a man, who swore that he was one of the first to  arrive, and pick up the sword and place it in its scabbard to prevent  its being lost. No doubt he lied; but as Mocenigo's influence in the  council was greater than that of the Morosini, the story was accepted.  However, the public feeling was so strong that they could not do less  than sentence Ruggiero to two years' banishment. I suppose that has  just expired, and he has returned from Constantinople. He had a bad  reputation before this affair took place, but as his connections are so  powerful, I suppose he will be received as if nothing had happened.  There are plenty of others as bad as he is.\"    \"It's a scandalous thing,\" Francis Hammond said indignantly, \"that,  just because they have got powerful connections, men should be allowed  to do, almost with impunity, things for which an ordinary man would be  hung. There ought to be one law for the rich as well as the poor.\"    \"So there is as far as the state is concerned,\" his companion replied.  \"A noble who plots against the state is as certain of a place in the  lowest dungeons as a fisherman who has done the same; but in other  respects there is naturally some difference.\"    \"Why naturally?\" Francis retorted. \"You belong to a powerful family,  Giustiniani, and my father is only a trader, but I don't see that  naturally you have any more right to get me stabbed in the back, than I  have to get you put out of the way.\"    \"Naturally perhaps not,\" Matteo laughed; \"but you see it has become a  second nature to us here in Venice. But seriously I admit that the  present state of things has grown to be a scandal, and that the doings  of some of our class ought to be put down with a strong hand.\"    \"Well, I shall say goodnight now,\" the English boy said. \"My father  doesn't like my being out after ten. He keeps up his English habits of  shutting up early, and has not learned to turn night into day as you do  here in Venice.\"    \"The bell has just tolled the hour, Francis,\" his father said as he  entered.    \"I didn't think it was quite so late, father; the Piazza is crowded. I  really do not think there is one person in Venice who goes to bed so  early as we do. It is so pleasant in the moonlight after the heat of  the day.\"    \"That is true enough, Francis, but men are meant to sleep at night and  to work in the day. I think our fathers carried this too far when they  rang the curfew at eight; but ten is quite late enough for any honest  man to be about in the streets, and the hours of the early morning are  just as pleasant and far more healthy than those of the evening,  especially in a place like this where the mists rise from the water, to  say nothing of the chance of meeting a band of wild gallants on their  way homewards heated with wine, or of getting a stab in the back from  some midnight assassin. However, I do not blame Venice for enjoying  herself while she can. She will have more serious matters to attend to  soon.\"    \"But she is at peace with every one at present, father. I thought when  she signed the treaty with Austria after a year's fighting, she was  going to have rest for a time.\"    \"That was only the beginning of the trouble, Francis, and the council  knew it well; that was why they made such terms with Austria as they  did. They knew that Austria was only acting in accord with Hungary, and  Padua, and Genoa. The others were not ready to begin, so Austria came  on her own account to get what booty and plunder she could. But the  storm is gathering, and will burst before long. But do not let us stand  talking here any longer. It is high time for you to be in bed.\"    But though Francis retired to his room, it was more than an hour before  he got into bed. His window looked down upon one of the canals running  into the Grand Canal. Gondolas lighted by lanterns, or by torches held  by servitors, passed constantly backwards and forwards beneath his  window, and by leaning out he could see the passing lights of those on  the Grand Canal. Snatches of song and laughter came up to him, and  sometimes the note of a musical instrument. The air was soft and balmy,  and he felt no inclination for sleep.    Francis thought over what his father had said of the probability of  war,"]]]
