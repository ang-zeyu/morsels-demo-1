ION: Yes; in my opinion there are a good many.    SOCRATES: And can you interpret better what Homer says, or what Hesiod  says, about these matters in which they agree?    ION: I can interpret them equally well, Socrates, where they agree.    SOCRATES: But what about matters in which they do not agree?--for  example, about divination, of which both Homer and Hesiod have something  to say,--    ION: Very true:    SOCRATES: Would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter of what  these two poets say about divination, not only when they agree, but when  they disagree?    ION: A prophet.    SOCRATES: And if you were a prophet, would you not be able to interpret  them when they disagree as well as when they agree?    ION: Clearly.    SOCRATES: But how did you come to have this skill about Homer only, and  not about Hesiod or the other poets? Does not Homer speak of the same  themes which all other poets handle? Is not war his great argument? and  does he not speak of human society and of intercourse of men, good and  bad, skilled and unskilled, and of the gods conversing with one another  and with mankind, and about what happens in heaven and in the world  below, and the generations of gods and heroes? Are not these the themes  of which Homer sings?    ION: Very true, Socrates.    SOCRATES: And do not the other poets sing of the same?    ION: Yes, Socrates; but not in the same way as Homer.    SOCRATES: What, in a worse way?    ION: Yes, in a far worse.    SOCRATES: And Homer in a better way?    ION: He is incomparably better.    SOCRATES: And yet surely, my dear friend Ion, in a discussion about  arithmetic, where many people are speaking, and one speaks better than  the rest, there is somebody who can judge which of them is the good  speaker?    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: And he who judges of the good will be the same as he who  judges of the bad speakers?    ION: The same.    SOCRATES: And he will be the arithmetician?    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: Well, and in discussions about the wholesomeness of food, when  many persons are speaking, and one speaks better than the rest, will  he who recognizes the better speaker be a different person from him who  recognizes the worse, or the same?    ION: Clearly the same.    SOCRATES: And who is he, and what is his name?    ION: The physician.    SOCRATES: And speaking generally, in all discussions in which the  subject is the same and many men are speaking, will not he who knows the  good know the bad speaker also? For if he does not know the bad, neither  will he know the good when the same topic is being discussed.    ION: True.    SOCRATES: Is not the same person skilful in both?    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: And you say that Homer and the other poets, such as Hesiod and  Archilochus, speak of the same things, although not in the same way; but  the one speaks well and the other not so well?    ION: Yes; and I am right in saying so.    SOCRATES: And if you knew the good speaker, you would also know the  inferior speakers to be inferior?    ION: That is true.    SOCRATES: Then, my dear friend, can I be mistaken in saying that Ion  is equally skilled in Homer and in other poets, since he himself  acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those who  speak of the same things; and that almost all poets do speak of the same  things?    ION: Why then, Socrates, do I lose attention and go to sleep and have  absolutely no ideas of the least value, when any one speaks of any  other poet; but when Homer is mentioned, I wake up at once and am all  attention and have plenty to say?    SOCRATES: The reason, my friend, is obvious. No one can fail to see that  you speak of Homer without any art or knowledge. If you were able to  speak of him by rules of art, you would have been able to speak of all  other poets; for poetry is a whole.    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: And when any one acquires any other art as a whole, the same  may be said of them. Would you like me to explain my meaning, Ion?    ION: Yes, indeed, Socrates; I very much wish that you would: for I love  to hear you wise men talk.    SOCRATES: O that we were wise, Ion, and that you could truly call us so;  but you rhapsodes and actors, and the poets whose verses you sing, are  wise; whereas I am a common man, who only speak the truth. For consider  what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this which I have said--a  thing which any man might say: that when a man has acquired a knowledge  of a whole art, the enquiry into good and bad is one and the same. Let  us consider this matter; is not the art of painting a whole?    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: And there are and have been many painters good and bad?    ION: Yes.    SOCRATES: And did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing  out the excellences and defects of Polygnotus the son of Aglaophon, but  incapable of criticizing other painters; and when the work of any other  painter was produced, went to sleep and was at a loss, and had no ideas;  but when he had to give his opinion about Polygnotus, or whoever the  painter might be, and about him only, woke up and was attentive and had  plenty to say?    ION: No indeed, I have never known such a person.    SOCRATES: Or did you ever know of any one in sculpture, who was skilful  in expounding the merits of Daedalus the son of Metion, or of Epeius  the son of Panopeus, or of Theodorus the Samian, or of any individual  sculptor; but when the works of sculptors in general were produced, was  at a loss and went to sleep and had nothing to say?    ION: No indeed; no more than the other.    SOCRATES: And if I am not mistaken, you never met with any one among  flute-players or harp-players or singers to the harp or rhapsodes who  was able to discourse of Olympus or Thamyras or Orpheus, or Phemius the  rhapsode of Ithaca, but was at a loss when he came to speak of Ion of  Ephesus, and had no notion of his merits or defects?    ION: I cannot deny what you say, Socrates. Nevertheless I am conscious  in my own self, and the world agrees with me in thinking that I do speak  better and have more to say about Homer than any other man. But I do not  speak equally well about others--tell me the reason of this.    SOCRATES: I perceive, Ion; and I will proceed to explain to you what I  imagine to be the reason of this. The gift which you possess of speaking  excellently about Homer is not an art, but, as I was just saying, an  inspiration; there is a divinity moving you, like that contained in the  stone which Euripides calls a magnet, but which is commonly known as  the stone of Heraclea. This stone not only attracts iron rings, but also  imparts to them a similar power of attracting other rings; and sometimes  you may see a number of pieces of iron and rings suspended from one  another so as to form quite a long chain: and all of them derive their  power of suspension from the original stone. In like manner the Muse  first of all inspires men herself; and from these inspired persons a  chain of other persons is suspended, who take the inspiration. For all  good poets, epic as well as lyric, compose their beautiful poems not by  art, but because they are inspired and possessed. And as the Corybantian  revellers when they dance are not in their right mind, so the lyric  poets are not in their right mind when they are composing their  beautiful strains: but when falling under the power of music and metre  they are inspired and possessed; like Bacchic maidens who draw milk and  honey from the rivers when they are under the influence of Dionysus but  not when they are in their right mind. And the soul of the lyric poet  does the same, as they themselves say; for they tell us that they bring  songs from honeyed fountains, culling them out of the gardens and dells  of the Muses; they, like the bees, winging their way from flower to  flower. And this is true. For the poet is a light and winged and holy  thing, and there is no invention in him until he has been inspired and  is out of his senses, and the mind is no longer in him: when he has  not attained to this state, he is powerless and is unable to utter his  oracles. Many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the  actions of men; but like yourself when speaking about Homer, they do  not speak of them by any rules of art: they are simply inspired to utter  that to which the Muse impels them, and that only; and when inspired,  one of them will make dithyrambs, another hymns of praise, another  choral strains, another epic or iambic verses--and he who is good at  one is not good at any other kind of verse: for not by art does the poet  sing, but by power divine. Had he learned by rules of art, he would have  known how to speak not of one theme only, but of all; and therefore God  takes away the minds of poets, and uses them as his ministers, as he  also uses diviners and holy prophets, in order that we who hear them  may know them to be speaking not of themselves who utter these priceless  words in a state of unconsciousness, but that God himself is the  speaker, and that through them he is conversing with us. And Tynnichus  the Chalcidian affords a striking instance of what I am saying: he wrote  nothing that any one would care to remember but the famous paean which  is in every one's mouth, one of the finest poems ever written, simply  an invention of the Muses, as he himself says. For in this way the  God would seem to indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these  beautiful poems are not human, or the work of man, but divine and the  work of God; and that the poets are only the interpreters of the Gods by  whom they are severally possessed. Was not this the lesson which the God  intended to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the  best of songs? Am I not right, Ion?

Olivares said to  Buckingham, \"You gave me some assurance and hope of the prince's  _turning catholic_.\" The duke roundly answered that it was false. The  Spanish minister, confounded at the bluntness of our English duke, broke  from him in a violent rage, and lamented that state matters would not  suffer him to do himself justice. This insult was never forgiven; and  some time afterwards he attempted to revenge himself on Buckingham, by  endeavouring to persuade James that he was at the head of a conspiracy  against him.    We hasten to conclude these anecdotes, not to be found in the pages of  Hume and Smollett.--Wilson says that both kingdoms  rejoiced:--\"Preparations were made in England to entertain the Infanta;  a new church was built at St. James's, the foundation-stone of which was  laid by the Spanish ambassador, for the public exercise of her religion:  her portrait was multiplied in every corner of the town; such as hoped  to flourish under her eye suddenly began to be powerful. In Spain (as  Wilson quaintly expresses himself) the substance was as much courted as  the shadow here. Indeed the Infanta, Howel tells us, was applying hard  to the English language, and was already called the Princess of England.  To conclude,--Charles complained of the repeated delays; and he and the  Spanish court parted with a thousand civilities. The Infanta however  observed, that had the Prince loved her, he would not have quitted her.\"    How shall we dispel those clouds of mystery with which politics have  covered this strange transaction? It appears that James had in view the  restoration of the palatinate to his daughter, whom he could not  effectually assist; that the court of Rome had speculations of the most  dangerous tendency to the protestant religion; that the marriage was  broken off by that personal hatred which existed between Olivares and  Buckingham; and that, if there was any sincerity existing between the  parties concerned, it rested with the Prince and the Infanta, who were  both youthful and romantic, and were but two beautiful ivory balls in  the hands of great players.          DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM.      The Duke of Buckingham, in his bold and familiar manner, appears to have  been equally a favourite with James I. and Charles I. He behaved with  singular indiscretion both at the courts of France and Spain.    Various anecdotes might be collected from the memoir writers of those  countries, to convince us that our court was always little respected by  its ill choice of this ambassador. His character is hit off by one  master-stroke from the pencil of Hume: \"He had,\" says this penetrating  observer of men, \"English familiarity and French levity;\" so that he was  in full possession of two of the most offensive qualities an ambassador  can possess.    Sir Henry Wotton has written an interesting life of our duke. At school  his character fully discovered itself, even at that early period of  life. He would not apply to any serious studies, but excelled in those  lighter qualifications adapted to please in the world. He was a graceful  horseman, musician, and dancer. His mother withdrew him from school at  the early age of thirteen, and he soon became a domestic favourite. Her  fondness permitted him to indulge in every caprice, and to cultivate  those agreeable talents which were natural to him. His person was  beautiful, and his manners insinuating. In a word, he was adapted to  become a courtier. The fortunate opportunity soon presented itself; for  James saw him, and invited him to court, and showered on him, with a  prodigal hand, the cornucopia of royal patronage.    Houssaie, in his political memoirs, has detailed an anecdote of this  duke, only known to the English reader in the general observation of the  historian. When he was sent to France, to conduct the Princess Henrietta  to the arms of Charles I., he had the insolence to converse with the  Queen of France, not as an ambassador, but as a lover! The Marchioness  of Senecy, her lady of honour, enraged at seeing this conversation  continue, seated herself in the arm-chair of the Queen, who that day was  confined to her bed; she did this to hinder the insolent duke from  approaching the Queen, and probably taking other liberties. As she  observed that he still persisted in the lover, \"Sir,\" she said, in a  severe tone of voice, \"you must learn to be silent; it is not thus we  address the Queen of France.\"    This audacity of the duke is further confirmed by Nani, in his sixth  book of the History of Venice; an historian who is not apt to take  things lightly. For when Buckingham was desirous of once more being  ambassador at that court, in 1626, it was signified by the French  ambassador, that for reasons _well known to himself_, his person would  not be agreeable to his most Christian majesty. In a romantic threat,  the duke exclaimed, he would go and see the queen in spite of the French  court; and to this petty affair is to be ascribed the war between the  two nations!    The Marshal de Bassompiere, in the journal of his embassy, affords  another instance of his \"English familiarity.\" He says, \"The King of  England gave me a long audience, and a very disputatious one. He put  himself in a passion, while I, without losing my respect, expressed  myself freely. The Duke of Buckingham, when he observed the king and  myself very warm, leapt suddenly betwixt his majesty and me, exclaiming,  'I am come to set all to rights betwixt you, which I think is high  time.'\"    Cardinal Richelieu hated Buckingham as sincerely as did the Spaniard  Olivares. This enmity was apparently owing to the cardinal writing to  the duke without leaving any space open after the title of Monsieur; the  duke, to show his equality, returned his answer in the same  \"paper-sparing\" manner. Richelieu was jealous of Buckingham, whose  favour with the Queen of France was known.    This ridiculous circumstance between Richelieu and Buckingham reminds me  of a similar one, which happened to two Spanish Lords:--One signed at  the end of his letter EL _Marques_ (THE _Marquis_), as if the title had  been peculiar to himself for its excellence. His national vanity  received a dreadful reproof from his correspondent, who, jealous of his  equality, signed OTRO _Marqies_ (ANOTHER _Marquis_).    An anecdote given by Sir Henry Wotton offers a characteristic trait of  Charles and his favourite:--    \"They were now entered into the deep time of Lent, and could get no  flesh into their inns; whereupon fell out a pleasant passage (if I may  insert it by the way among more serious):--There was near Bayon a herd  of goats with their young ones; on which sight Sir Richard Graham  (master of the horse to the marquis) tells the marquis he could snap one  of the kids, and make some shift to carry him close to their lodgings;  which the prince overhearing, 'Why, Richard,' says he, 'do you think you  may practise here your old tricks again upon the borders?' Upon which  word they first gave the goatherd good contentment, and then while the  marquis and his servant, being both on foot, were chasing the kid about  the flock, the prince from horseback killed him in the head with a  Scottish pistol. Let this serve for a journal parenthesis, which yet may  show how his highness, even in such light and sportful damage, had a  noble sense of just dealing.\"          THE DEATH OF CHARLES IX.      Dr. Cayet is an old French controversial writer, but is better known in  French literature as an historian. His _Chronologie Novenaire_ is full  of anecdotes unknown to other writers. He collected them from his own  observations, for he was under-preceptor to Henry IV. The dreadful  massacre of St. Bartholomew took place in the reign of Charles IX.; on  which occasion the English court went into mourning. The singular death  of Charles has been regarded by the Huguenots as an interposition of  divine justice: he died bathed in his blood, which burst from his veins.  The horrors of this miserable prince on his dying bed are forcibly  depicted by the anecdotes I am now collecting. I shall premise, however,  that Charles was a mere instrument in the hands of his mother, the  political and cruel Catherine of Medicis.    Dr. Cayet, with honest _naivete_, thus relates what he knew to have  passed a few hours before his death.    \"King Charles, feeling himself near his end, after having passed some  time without pronouncing a word, said, as he turned himself on one side,  and as if he seemed to awake, 'Call my brother!' The queen mother was  present, who immediately sent for the Duke of Alencon. The king  perceiving him, turned his back, and again said, 'Let my brother come!'  The queen, his mother, replied, 'Sir, I do not know whom you mean; here  is your brother.' The king was displeased, and said, 'Let them bring my  brother the King of Navarre; it is he who is my brother.' The queen  mother observing the dying monarch's resolute order, sent for him; but,  for reasons known only to herself, she commanded the captain of the  guards to conduct him under the vaults. They went to the King of  Navarre, and desired him to come and speak to the king; at that moment,  this prince has since repeatedly said, he felt a shuddering and  apprehension of death so much that he would not go. But King Charles  persisting on his coming, the queen mother assured him that he should  receive no injury. In this promise, however, he put little trust. He  went, accompanied by the Viscount d'Auchy, on whose word he chiefly  relied. Having, however, observed under these vaults a great number of  halberdiers and arquebusiers in ranks, he would have returned, when the  viscount and the captain reassured him that no harm should happen to  him. The soldiers bowed, and their behaviour was respectful. By a  private staircase he entered the chamber of the king, who, immediately "]]]
