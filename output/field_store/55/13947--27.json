This Introduction endeavors  to be as suggestive as possible to parents and teachers who are  personally conducted and introduced to the host of writers learned and  quaint, human and pedantic, humorous and brilliant and profound, who  have dealt technically with this fascinating subject.          INTRODUCTION    It was the habit of him whose birthday we celebrate to take what was  good in men and remould it to higher uses. And so it is peculiarly  fitting that the anniversary of Christmas, when it was first celebrated  in the second century of our era should have taken from heathen  mythology and customs the more beautiful parts for its own use.  \"Christmas,\" says Dean Stanley, \"brings before us the relations of the  Christian religion to the religions which went before; for the birth at  Bethlehem was itself a link with the past.\"    The pagan nations of antiquity[A] always had a tendency to worship the  sun, under different names, as the giver of light and life. And their  festivals in its honor took place near the winter solstice, the shortest  day in the year, when the sun in December begins its upward course,  thrilling men with the first distant promise of spring. This holiday was  called _Saturnalia_ among the Romans and was marked by great merriment  and licence which extended even to the slaves. There were feasting and  gifts and the houses were hung with evergreens. A more barbarous form of  these rejoicings took place among the rude peoples of the north where  great blocks of wood blazed in honor of Odin and Thor, and sacrifices of  men and cattle were made to them. Mistletoe was cut then from the sacred  oaks with a golden sickle by the Prince of the Druids, between whom and  the Fire-Worshippers of Persia there was an affinity both in character  and customs.    [Footnote A: An account of the early history of Christmas may be found  in Chamber's Book of Days.]    The ancient Goths and Saxons called this festival Yule, which is  preserved to us in the Scottish word for Christmas and also in the name  of the Yule Log. The ancient Teutons celebrated the season by decking a  fir tree, for they thought of the sun, riding higher and higher in the  heavens, as the spreading and blossoming of a great tree. Thus our own  Christmas fir was decked as a symbol of the celestial sun tree. The  lights, according to Professor Schwartz, represent the flashes of  lightning overhead, the golden apples, nuts and balls symbolize the sun,  the moon and the stars, while the little animals hung in the branches  betoken sacrifices made in gratitude to the sun god.[B]    [Footnote B: A delightful account of the origin of the Christmas tree  may be found in Elise Traut's Christmas in Heart and Home.]    As Christianity replaced paganism, the Christians, in the tolerant  spirit of their Master, adopted these beautiful old usages, merely  changing their spirit. So that the Lord of Misrule who long presided  over the Christmas games of Christian England was the direct descendant  of the ruler who was appointed, with considerable prerogatives, to  preside over the sports of the Saturnalia. In this connection the narrow  Puritan author of the \"Histrio-Mastix\" laments: \"If we compare our  Bacchanalian Christmasses with these Saturnalia, we shall find such a  near affinitye between them, both in regard to time and in manner of  solemnizing, that we must needs conclude the one to be but the very  issue of the other.\"    \"Merrie old England,\" writes Walsh,[C] \"was the soil in which Merrie  Christmas took its firmest root.\" Even in Anglo-Saxon days we hear of  Alfred holding high revelry in December, 878, so that he allowed the  Danes to surprise him, cut his army to pieces and send him a fugitive.  The court revelries increased in splendor after the conquest. Christmas,  it must be remembered was not then a single day of sport. It had the  preliminary novena which began December 16, and it ended on January 6,  or Twelfth Night. All this period was devoted to holiday making.    [Footnote C: Curiosities of Popular Customs.]    It was a democratic festival. All classes mixed in its merry-makings.  Hospitality was universal. An English country gentleman of the fifteenth  and sixteenth centuries held open house. With daybreak on Christmas  morning the tenants and neighbors thronged into the hall. The ale was  broached. Blackjacks and Cheshire cheese, with toast and sugar and  nutmeg, went plentifully round. The Hackin, or great sausage, must be  boiled at daybreak, and if it failed to be ready two young men took the  cook by the arm and ran her around the market-place till she was ashamed  of her laziness.    With the rise of Puritanism the very existence of Christmas was  threatened. Even the harmless good cheer of that season was looked upon  as pagan, or, what was worse, Popish. 'Into what a stupendous _height_  of more than pagan impiety,' cried Prynne (...) 'have we not now  _degenerated!_' Prynne's rhetoric, it will be seen, is not without an  unconscious charm of humor. He complained that the England of his day  could not celebrate Christmas or any other festival 'without drinking,  roaring, healthing, dicing, carding, dancing, masques and stage-plays  (...) which Turkes and Infidels would abhor to practise.'    Puritanism brought over with it in the Mayflower the anti-Christmas  feeling to New England. So early as 1621 Governor Bradford was called  upon to administer a rebuke to 'certain lusty yonge men' who had just  come over in the little ship Fortune. 'On ye day called Christmas day,'  says William Bradford, 'ye Gov^r caled them out to worke (as was used),  but ye most of this new company excused themselves and said it went  against their consciences to worke on ye day. So ye Gov^r tould them  that if they made it matter of conscience, he would spare them till they  were better informed. So he led away ye rest, and left them; but when  they came home at noone from their worke, he found them in ye streete at  play, openly: some pitching ye barr, and some at stoole-ball and such  like sports. So he went to them and tooke away their implements, and  tould them that it was against his conscience that they should play and  others worke. If they made ye keeping of it matter of devotion, let them  kepe their houses, but ther should be no gameing or revelling in ye  streets. Since which time nothing hath been attempted that way, at least  openly.'    In England the feeling culminated in 1643, when the Roundhead Parliament  abolished the observance of saints' days and \"the three grand festivals\"  of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, \"any law, statute, custom,  constitution, or canon to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.\" The  king protested. But he was answered. In London, nevertheless, there was  an alarming disposition to observe Christmas. The mob attacked those who  by opening their shops flouted the holiday. In several counties the  disorder was threatening. But Parliament adopted strong measures, and  during the twelve years in which the great festivals were  discountenanced there was no further tumult, and the observance of  Christmas as a general holiday ceased.    The General Court of Massachusetts followed the example of the English  Parliament in 1659 when it enacted that 'anybody who is found observing,  by abstinence from labor, feasting, or any other way, any such day as  Christmas day, shall pay for every such offense five shillings.'    The restoration of English royalty brought about the restoration of the  English Christmas. It was not till 1681, however, that Massachusetts  repealed the ordinance of 1659. But the repeal was bitter to old  Puritanism, which kept up an ever attenuating protest even down to the  early part of the present century.    There are many superstitions connected with the coming of Christmas  itself. The bees are said to sing, the cattle to kneel, in honor of the  manger, and the sheep to go in procession in commemoration of the visit  of the angel to the shepherds.    Howison in his \"Sketches of Upper Canada\" relates that on one moonlit  Christmas Eve he saw an Indian creeping cautiously through the woods. In  response to an inquiry, he said. 'Me watch to see deer kneel. Christmas  night all deer kneel and look up to Great Spirit.'    In the German Alps it is believed that the cattle have the gift of  language on Christmas Eve. But it is a sin to attempt to play the  eavesdropper upon them. An Alpine story is told of a farmer's servant  who did not believe that the cattle could speak, and, to make sure, he  hid in his master's stable on Christmas Eve and listened. When the clock  struck twelve he was surprised at what he heard. 'We shall have hard  work to do this day week,' said one horse. 'Yes; the farmer's servant is  heavy,' answered the other horse. 'And the way to the churchyard is long  and steep,' said the first. The servant was buried that day week.    There is a beautiful superstition about the cock that Shakespeare put  into the mouth of Marcellus, in _Hamlet_--        \"Some say, that ever 'gainst that season comes      Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,      The bird of dawning singeth all night long:      And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad;      The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,      No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;      So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\"    No other holiday has so rich an heritage of old customs and observances  as Christmas. The Yule Log has from time immemorial been haled to the  open fire-place on Christmas Eve, and lighted with the embers of its  predecessor to sanctify the roof-tree and protect it against those evil  spirits over whom the season is in everyway a triumph. Then the wassail  bowl full of swimming roasted apples, goes its merry round. Then the  gift-shadowing Christmas tree sheds its divine brilliance down the path  of the coming year; or stockings"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18909"],[0,"Poems Teachers Ask For (#2)"],[1,"    136  November                              _A.

Of this collection that  can properly be claimed. For a decade NORMAL INSTRUCTOR-PRIMARY PLANS  has carried monthly a page entitled \"Poems Our Readers Have Asked For.\"  The interest in this page has been, and is, phenomenal. Occasionally  space considerations or copyright restrictions have prevented compliance  with requests, but so far as practicable poems asked for have been  printed. Because it has become impossible to furnish many of the earlier  issues of the magazine, the publishers decided to select the poems most  often requested and, carefully revising these for possible errors, to  include them in the present collection. In some cases the desired poems  are old favorite dramatic recitations, but many of them are poems that  are required or recommended for memorizing in state courses of study.  This latter feature will of itself make the book extremely valuable to  teachers throughout the country. We are glad to offer here certain  poems, often requested, but too long for insertion on our magazine  Poetry Page. We are pleased also to be able to include a number of  popular copyright poems.
