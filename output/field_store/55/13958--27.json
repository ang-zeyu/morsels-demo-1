SIX SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE      THERE was once a man who was a Jack-of-all-trades; he had served in the  war, and had been brave and bold, but at the end of it he was sent about  his business, with three farthings and his discharge.    \"I am not going to stand this,\" said he; \"wait till I find the right man  to help me, and the king shall give me all the treasures of his kingdom  before he has done with me.\"    Then, full of wrath, he went into the forest, and he saw one standing  there by six trees which he had rooted up as if they had been stalks of  corn. And he said to him,    \"Will you be my man, and come along with me?\"    \"All right,\" answered he; \"I must just take this bit of wood home to my  father and mother.\" And taking one of the trees, he bound it round the  other five, and putting the faggot on his shoulder, he carried it off;  then soon coming back, he went along with his leader, who said,    \"Two such as we can stand against the whole world.\"    And when they had gone on a little while, they came to a huntsman who  was kneeling on one knee and taking careful aim with his rifle.    \"Huntsman,\" said the leader, \"what are you aiming at?\"    \"Two miles from here,\" answered he, \"there sits a fly on the bough of an  oak-tree, I mean to put a bullet into its left eye.\"    \"Oh, come along with me,\" said the leader; \"three of us together can  stand against the world.\"    The huntsman was quite willing to go with him, and so they went on till  they came to seven windmills, whose sails were going round briskly, and  yet there was no wind blowing from any quarter, and not a leaf stirred.    \"Well,\" said the leader, \"I cannot think what ails the windmills,  turning without wind;\" and he went on with his followers about two miles  farther, and then they came to a man sitting up in a tree, holding one  nostril and blowing with the other.    \"Now then,\" said the leader, \"what are you doing up there?\"    \"Two miles from here,\" answered he, \"there are seven windmills; I am  blowing, and they are going round.\"    \"Oh, go with me,\" cried the leader, \"four of us together can stand  against the world.\"    So the blower got down and went with them, and after a time they came to  a man standing on one leg, and the other had been taken off and was  lying near him.    \"You seem to have got a handy way of resting yourself,\" said the leader  to the man.    \"I am a runner,\" answered he, \"and in order to keep myself from going  too fast I have taken off a leg, for when I run with both, I go faster  than a bird can fly.\"    \"Oh, go with me,\" cried the leader, \"five of us together may well stand  against the world.\"    So he went with them all together, and it was not long before they met a  man with a little hat on, and he wore it just over one ear.    \"Manners! manners!\" said the leader; \"with your hat like that, you look  like a jack-fool.\"    \"I dare not put it straight,\" answered the other; \"if I did, there would  be such a terrible frost that the very birds would be frozen and fall  dead from the sky to the ground.\"    \"Oh, come with me,\" said the leader; \"we six together may well stand  against the whole world.\"    So the six went on until they came to a town where the king had caused  it to be made known that whoever would run a race with his daughter and  win it might become her husband, but that whoever lost must lose his  head into the bargain. And the leader came forward and said one of his  men should run for him.    \"Then,\" said the king, \"his life too must be put in pledge, and if he  fails, his head and yours too must fall.\"    When this was quite settled and agreed upon, the leader called the  runner, and strapped his second leg on to him.    \"Now, look out,\" said he, \"and take care that we win.\"    It had been agreed that the one who should bring water first from a far  distant brook should be accounted winner. Now the king's daughter and  the runner each took a pitcher, and they started both at the same time;  but in one moment, when the king's daughter had gone but a very little  way, the runner was out of sight, for his running was as if the wind  rushed by. In a short time he reached the brook, filled his pitcher full  of water, and turned back again. About half-way home, however, he was  overcome with weariness, and setting down his pitcher, he lay down on  the ground to sleep. But in order to awaken soon again by not lying too  soft he had taken a horse's skull which lay near and placed it under his  head for a pillow. In the meanwhile the king's daughter, who really was  a good runner, good enough to beat an ordinary man, had reached the  brook, and filled her pitcher, and was hastening with it back again,  when she saw the runner lying asleep.    \"The day is mine,\" said she with much joy, and she emptied his pitcher  and hastened on. And now all had been lost but for the huntsman who was  standing on the castle wall, and with his keen eyes saw all that  happened.    \"We must not be outdone by the king's daughter,\" said he, and he loaded  his rifle and took so good an aim that he shot the horse's skull from  under the runner's head without doing him any harm. And the runner awoke  and jumped up, and saw his pitcher standing empty and the king's  daughter far on her way home. But, not losing courage, he ran swiftly to  the brook, filled it again with water, and for all that, he got home ten  minutes before the king's daughter.    \"Look you,\" said he; \"this is the first time I have really stretched my  legs; before it was not worth the name of running.\"    The king was vexed, and his daughter yet more so, that she should be  beaten by a discharged common soldier; and they took counsel together  how they might rid themselves of him and of his companions at the same  time.    \"I have a plan,\" said the king; \"do not fear but that we shall be quit  of them for ever.\" Then he went out to the men and bade them to feast  and be merry and eat and drink; and he led them into a room, which had a  floor of iron, and the doors were iron, the windows had iron frames and  bolts; in the room was a table set out with costly food.    \"Now, go in there and make yourselves comfortable,\" said the king.    And when they had gone in, he had the door locked and bolted. Then he  called the cook, and told him to make a big fire underneath the room, so  that the iron floor of it should be red hot. And the cook did so, and  the six men began to feel the room growing very warm, by reason, as they  thought at first, of the good dinner; but as the heat grew greater and  greater, and they found the doors and windows fastened, they began to  think it was an evil plan of the king's to suffocate them.    \"He shall not succeed, however,\" said the man with the little hat; \"I  will bring on a frost that shall make the fire feel ashamed of itself,  and creep out of the way.\"    So he set his hat straight on his head, and immediately there came such  a frost that all the heat passed away and the food froze in the dishes.  After an hour or two had passed, and the king thought they must have all  perished in the heat, he caused the door to be opened, and went himself  to see how they fared. And when the door flew back, there they were all  six quite safe and sound, and they said they were quite ready to come  out, so that they might warm themselves, for the great cold of that room  had caused the food to freeze in the dishes. Full of wrath, the king  went to the cook and scolded him, and asked why he had not done as he  was ordered.    \"It is hot enough there: you may see for yourself,\" answered the cook.  And the king looked and saw an immense fire burning underneath the room  of iron, and he began to think that the six men were not to be got rid  of in that way. And he thought of a new plan by which it might be  managed, so he sent for the leader and said to him,    \"If you will give up your right to my daughter, and take gold instead,  you may have as much as you like.\"    \"Certainly, my lord king,\" answered the man; \"let me have as much gold  as my servant can carry, and I give up all claim to your daughter.\" And  the king agreed that he should come again in a fortnight to fetch the  gold. The man then called together all the tailors in the kingdom, and  set them to work to make a sack, and it took them a fortnight. And when  it was ready, the strong man who had been found rooting up trees took it  on his shoulder, and went to the king.    \"Who is this immense fellow carrying on his shoulder a bundle of stuff  as big as a house?\" cried the king, terrified to think how much gold he  would carry off. And a ton of gold was dragged in by sixteen strong men,  but he put it all into the sack with one hand, saying,    \"Why don't you bring some more? this hardly covers the bottom!\" So the  king bade them fetch by degrees the whole of his treasure, and even then  the sack was not half full.    \"Bring more!\" cried the man; \"these few scraps go no way at all!\" Then  at last seven thousand waggons laden with gold collected through the  whole kingdom were driven up; and he threw them in his sack, oxen and  all.    \"I will not look too closely,\" said he, \"but take what I can get, so  long as the sack is full.\" And when all was put in there was still  plenty of room.    \"I must make an end of this,\" he said; \"if it is not full, it is so much  the easier to tie up.\" And he hoisted it on his back, and went off with  his comrades.    When the king saw all the wealth of his realm carried off by a single  man he was full of wrath, and he bade his cavalry mount, and follow  after the six men, and take the sack away from the strong man.    Two regiments were soon up to them, and called them to consider  themselves prisoners, and to deliver up the sack, or be cut in pieces.    \"Prisoners, say you?\" said the man who could blow, \"suppose you first  have a little dance together in the air,\" and holding"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19090"],[0,"Star Hunter (#2)"],[1,"Kogan Brodie.\"    \"And her son Rynch Brodie, who was at the time of the Largo Drift's  disappearance a boy of fourteen.\"    \"You have indeed made a find.\" Wass gave that simple statement enough  emphasis to assure Hume he had won. His one-in-a-thousand idea had  been absorbed, was now being examined, amplified, broken down into  details he could never have hoped to manage for himself, by the most  cunning criminal brain in at least five solar systems.    \"Is there any hope of survivors?\" Wass attacked the problem straight  on.    \"No evidence even of there being any passengers when the L-B planeted.  Those are automatic and released a certain number of seconds after an  accident alarm. For what it's worth the hatch of this one was open. It  could have brought in survivors. But I was on Jumala for three months  with a full Guild crew and we found no sign of any castaways.\"    \"So you propose--?\"    \"On the basis of my report Jumala has been put up for a safari choice.  The L-B could well be innocently discovered by a client. Every one  knows the story with the case dragging through the Ten Sector-Terran  Courts now. Gentlefem Brodie and her son might not have been news ten  years ago. Now, with a third of the Kogan-Bors-Wazalitz control going  to them, any find linked with the Largo Drift would gain full galactic  coverage.\"    \"You have a choice of survivor? The Gentlefem?\"    Hume shook his head. \"The boy. He was bright, according to the stories  since, and he would have the survival manual from the ship to study.  He could have grown up in the wilds of an unopened planet. To use a  woman is too tricky.\"    \"You are entirely right. But we shall require an extremely clever  imposter.\"    \"I think not.\" Hume's cool glance met Wass'. \"We only need a youth of  the proper general physical description and the use of a conditioner.\"    Wass' expression did not change, there was no sign that Hume's hint  had struck home. But when he replied there was a slight change in the  monotone of his voice.    \"You seem to know a great deal.\"    \"I am a man who listens,\" Hume replied, \"and I do not always discount  rumor as mere fantasy.\"    \"That is true. As one of the guild you would be interested in the root  of fact beneath the plant of fiction,\" Wass acknowledged. \"You appear  to have done some planning on your own.\"    \"I have waited and watched for just such an opportunity as this,\" Hume  answered.    \"Ah, yes. The Kogan-Bors-Wazalitz combine incurred your displeasure. I  see you are also a man who does not forget easily. And that, too, I  understand. It is a foible of my own, Out-Hunter. I neither forget  nor forgive my enemies, though I may seem to do so and time separates  them from their past deeds for a space.\"    Hume accepted that warning--both must keep any bargain. Wass was  silent for a moment, as if to leave time for the thought to root  itself, then he spoke again.    \"A youth with the proper physical qualifications. Have you any such in  mind?\"    \"I think so.\" Hume was short.    \"He will need certain memories; those take time to tape.\"    \"Those dealing with Jumala, I can supply.\"    \"Yes. You will have to provide a tape beginning with his arrival on  that world. For such family material as is necessary I shall have  ready. An interesting project, even apart from its value to us. This  is one to intrigue experts.\"    Expert psycho-techs--Wass had them. Men who had slipped over the  border of the law, had entered Wass' organization and prospered there.  There were some techs crooked enough to enjoy such a project for its  own sake, indulging in forbidden experimentation. For a moment, but  only for a moment, something in Hume jibbed at the intent of carrying  through his plan. Then he shrugged that tinge aside.    \"How soon do you wish to move?\"    \"How long will preparation take?\" Hume asked in return, for the second  time battling a taste of concern.    \"Three months, maybe four. There's research to be done and tapes to be  made.\"    \"It will be six months probably before the Guild sets up a safari for  Jumala.\"    Wass smiled. \"That need not worry us. When the time comes for a  safari, there shall also be clients, impeccable clients, asking for it  to be planned.\"    There would be, too, Hume knew. Wass' influence reached into places  where the Veep himself was totally unknown. Yes, he could count on an  excellent, well above suspicion, set of clients to discover Rynch  Brodie when the time came.    \"I can deliver the boy tonight, or early tomorrow morning. Where?\"    \"You are sure of your selection?\"    \"He fulfills the requirements, the right age, general appearance. A  boy who will not be missed, who has no kin, no ties, and who will  drop out of sight without any questions to be asked.\"    \"Very well. Get him at once. Deliver him here.\"    Wass swept one hand across the table surface. On the red of the stone  there glowed for seconds an address. Hume noted it, nodded. It was one  in the center of the port town, one which could be visited at an odd  hour without exciting any curiosity. He rose.    \"He will be there.\"    \"Tomorrow, at your convenience,\" Wass added, \"you will come to this  place.\" Again the palm moved and a second address showed on the table.    \"There you will begin your tape for our use. It may take several  sessions.\"    \"I'm ready. I still have the long report to make to the Guild, so the  material is still available on my note tapes.\"    \"Excellent. Out-Hunter Hume, I salute a new colleague.\" At last Wass'  right hand came up from the table. \"May we both have luck equal to our  industry.\"    \"Luck to equal our desires,\" Hume corrected him.    \"A very telling phrase, Out-Hunter. Luck to equal our desires. Yes,  let us both deserve that.\"          2      The Starfall was a long way down scale from the pleasure houses of the  upper town. Here strange vices were also merchandise, but not such  exotics as Wass provided. This was strictly for crewmen of the star  freighters who could be speedily and expertly separated from a  voyage's pay in an evening. The tantalizing scents of Wass' terraces  were reduced here to simply smells, the majority of which were not  fragrant.    There had already been two fatal duels that evening. A tubeman from a  rim ship had challenged a space miner to settle a difference with  those vicious whips made from the tail casings of Flangoid flying  lizards, an encounter which left both men in ribbons, one dead, one  dying. And a scarred, ex-space marine had blaster-flamed one of the  Star-and-Comet dealers into charred human ash.    The young man who had been ordered to help clear away the second loser  retired to the stinking alley outside to lose the meal which was part  of his meager day's pay. Now he crawled back inside, his face  greenish, one hand pressed to his middle section.    He was thin, the fine bones of his face tight under the pallid skin,  his ribs showing even through the sleazy fabric of the threadbare  tunic with its house seal. When he leaned his head back against the  grime encrusted wall, raising his face to the light, his hair had the  glint of bright chestnut, a gold which was also red. And for his  swamper's labor he was almost fastidiously clean.    \"You--Lansor!\"    He shivered as if an icy wind had found him and opened his eyes. They  seemed disproportionately large in his skin and bone face and were of  an odd shade, neither green nor blue, but somewhere between.    \"Get going, you! Ain't paying out good credits for you to sit there  like you was buying on your own!\" The Salarkian who loomed above him  spoke accentless, idiomatic Basic Space which came strangely from  between his yellow lips. A furred hand thrust the handle of a mop-up  stick at the young man, a taloned thumb jerked the direction in which  to use that evil-smelling object. Vye Lansor levered himself up the  wall, took the mop, setting his teeth grimly.    Someone had spilled a mug of Kardo and the deep purple liquid was  already patterning the con-stone floor past any hope of cleaning. But  he set to work slapping the fringe of the noisome mop back and forth  to sop up what he could. The smell of the Kardo uniting with the  general effluvia of the room and its inhabitants heightened his  queasiness.    Working blindly in a half stupor, he was not aware of the man sitting  alone in the booth until his mop spattered the ankle of one of the  drinking girls. She struck him sharply across the face with a  sputtering curse in the tongue of Altar-Ishtar.    The blow sent him back against the open lattice of the booth. As he  tried to steady himself another hand reached up, fingers tightened  about his wrist. He flinched, tried to jerk away from that hold, only  to discover that he was the other's prisoner.    And looking down at his captor in apprehension, he was aware even then  of the different quality of this man. The patron wore the tunic of a  crewman, lighter patches where the ship's badges should have been to  show that he was not engaged. But, though his tunic was shabby, dirty,  his magnetic boots scuffed and badly worn, he was not like the others  now enjoying the pleasures of the Starfall.    \"This one--he makes trouble?\" The vast bulk of the Vorm-man who was  the Starfall's private law moved through the crowd with serene  confidence in his own strength, which no one there, unless blind,  deaf, and out-of-the-senses drunk, could dispute. His scaled,  six-fingered, claw hand reached out for Lansor and the boy cringed.    \"No trouble!\" There was the click of authority in the voice of the man  in the booth. His face, moments earlier taut and sharp with  intelligence, was suddenly slack, his tone slurred as he answered:  \"Looks like an old shipmate. No trouble, just want a drink with an old  shipmate.\"    But the grip which had pulled Vye forward, swung him around and down  on the other bench in the booth, was anything but slack. The Vorm-man  glanced from"]]]
