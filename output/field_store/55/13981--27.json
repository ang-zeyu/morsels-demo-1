The powerful operations of this titanic upheaval are  comprehensible to none except such as have recognized the claims of both  Baha'u'llah and the Bab. Their followers know full well whence it comes,  and what it will ultimately lead to. Though ignorant of how far it will  reach, they clearly recognize its genesis, are aware of its direction,  acknowledge its necessity, observe confidently its mysterious processes,  ardently pray for the mitigation of its severity, intelligently labor to  assuage its fury, and anticipate, with undimmed vision, the consummation  of the fears and the hopes it must necessarily engender.            THIS JUDGMENT OF GOD      This judgment of God, as viewed by those who have recognized Baha'u'llah  as His Mouthpiece and His greatest Messenger on earth, is both a  retributory calamity and an act of holy and supreme discipline. It is at  once a visitation from God and a cleansing process for all mankind. Its  fires punish the perversity of the human race, and weld its component  parts into one organic, indivisible, world-embracing community. Mankind,  in these fateful years, which at once signalize the passing of the first  century of the Baha'i Era and proclaim the opening of a new one, is, as  ordained by Him Who is both the Judge and the Redeemer of the human race,  being simultaneously called upon to give account of its past actions, and  is being purged and prepared for its future mission. It can neither escape  the responsibilities of the past, nor shirk those of the future. God, the  Vigilant, the Just, the Loving, the All-Wise Ordainer, can, in this  supreme Dispensation, neither allow the sins of an unregenerate humanity,  whether of omission or of commission, to go unpunished, nor will He be  willing to abandon His children to their fate, and refuse them that  culminating and blissful stage in their long, their slow and painful  evolution throughout the ages, which is at once their inalienable right  and their true destiny.    \"Bestir yourselves, O people,\" is, on the one hand, the ominous warning  sounded by Baha'u'llah Himself, \"in anticipation of the days of Divine  Justice, for the promised hour is now come.\" \"Abandon that which ye  possess, and seize that which God, Who layeth low the necks of men, hath  brought. Know ye of a certainty that if ye turn not back from that which  ye have committed, chastisement will overtake you on every side, and ye  shall behold things more grievous than that which ye beheld aforetime.\"  And again: \"We have fixed a time for you, O people! If ye fail, at the  appointed hour, to turn towards God, He, verily, will lay violent hold on  you, and will cause grievous afflictions to assail you from every  direction. How severe indeed is the chastisement with which your Lord will  then chastise you!\" And again: \"God assuredly dominateth the lives of them  that wronged Us, and is well aware of their doings. He will most certainly  lay hold on them for their sins. He, verily, is the fiercest of Avengers.\"  And finally: \"O ye peoples of the world! Know verily that an unforeseen  calamity is following you and that grievous retribution awaiteth you.  Think not the deeds ye have committed have been blotted from My sight. By  My Beauty! All your doings hath My pen graven with open characters upon  tablets of chrysolite.\"    \"The whole earth,\" Baha'u'llah, on the other hand, forecasting the bright  future in store for a world now wrapt in darkness, emphatically asserts,  \"is now in a state of pregnancy. The day is approaching when it will have  yielded its noblest fruits, when from it will have sprung forth the  loftiest trees, the most enchanting blossoms, the most heavenly  blessings.\" \"The time is approaching when every created thing will have  cast its burden. Glorified be God Who hath vouchsafed this grace that  encompasseth all things, whether seen or unseen!\" \"These great  oppressions,\" He, moreover, foreshadowing humanity's golden age, has  written, \"are preparing it for the advent of the Most Great Justice.\" This  Most Great Justice is indeed the Justice upon which the structure of the  Most Great Peace can alone, and must eventually, rest, while the Most  Great Peace will, in turn, usher in that Most Great, that World  Civilization which shall remain forever associated with Him Who beareth  the Most Great Name.    Beloved friends! Well nigh a hundred years have elapsed since the  Revelation of Baha'u'llah dawned upon the world--a Revelation, the nature  of which, as affirmed by Himself, \"none among the Manifestations of old,  except to a prescribed degree, hath ever completely apprehended.\" For a  whole century God has respited mankind, that it might acknowledge the  Founder of such a Revelation, espouse His Cause, proclaim His greatness,  and establish His Order. In a hundred volumes, the repositories of  priceless precepts, mighty laws, unique principles, impassioned  exhortations, reiterated warnings, amazing prophecies, sublime  invocations, and weighty commentaries, the Bearer of such a Message has  proclaimed, as no Prophet before Him has done, the Mission with which God  had entrusted Him. To emperors, kings, princes and potentates, to rulers,  governments, clergy and peoples, whether of the East or of the West,  whether Christian, Jew, Muslim, or Zoroastrian, He addressed, for  well-nigh fifty years, and in the most tragic circumstances, these  priceless pearls of knowledge and wisdom that lay hid within the ocean of  His matchless utterance. Forsaking fame and fortune, accepting  imprisonment and exile, careless of ostracism and obloquy, submitting to  physical indignities and cruel deprivations, He, the Vicegerent of God on  earth, suffered Himself to be banished from place to place and from  country to country, till at length He, in the Most Great Prison, offered  up His martyred son as a ransom for the redemption and unification of all  mankind. \"We verily,\" He Himself has testified, \"have not fallen short of  Our duty to exhort men, and to deliver that whereunto I was bidden by God,  the Almighty, the All-Praised. Had they hearkened unto Me, they would have  beheld the earth another earth.\" And again: \"Is there any excuse left for  anyone in this Revelation? No, by God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne! My  signs have encompassed the earth, and My power enveloped all mankind, and  yet the people are wrapped in a strange sleep!\"            WHAT RESPONSE TO HIS CALL?      How--we may well ask ourselves--has the world, the object of such Divine  solicitude, repaid Him Who sacrificed His all for its sake? What manner of  welcome did it accord Him, and what response did His call evoke? A clamor,  unparalleled in the history of _Sh_i'ih Islam, greeted, in the land of its  birth, the infant light of the Faith, in the midst of a people notorious  for its crass ignorance, its fierce fanaticism, its barbaric cruelty, its  ingrained prejudices, and the unlimited sway held over the masses by a  firmly entrenched ecclesiastical hierarchy. A persecution, kindling a  courage which, as attested by no less eminent an authority than the late  Lord Curzon of Kedleston, has been unsurpassed by that which the fires of  Smithfield evoked, mowed down, with tragic swiftness, no less than twenty  thousand of its heroic adherents, who refused to barter their newly born  faith for the fleeting honors and security of a mortal life.    To the bodily agonies inflicted upon these sufferers, the charges, so  unmerited, of Nihilism, occultism, anarchism, eclecticism, immorality,  sectarianism, heresy, political partisanship--each conclusively disproved  by the tenets of the Faith itself and by the conduct of its followers--were  added, swelling thereby the number of those who, unwittingly or  maliciously, were injuring its cause.    Unmitigated indifference on the part of men of eminence and rank;  unrelenting hatred shown by the ecclesiastical dignitaries of the Faith  from which it had sprung; the scornful derision of the people among whom  it was born; the utter contempt which most of those kings and rulers who  had been addressed by its Author manifested towards it; the condemnations  pronounced, the threats hurled, and the banishments decreed by those under  whose sway it arose and first spread; the distortion to which its  principles and laws were subjected by the envious and the malicious, in  lands and among peoples far beyond the country of its origin--all these are  but the evidences of the treatment meted out by a generation sunk in  self-content, careless of its God, and oblivious of the omens, prophecies,  warnings and admonitions revealed by His Messengers.    The blows so heavily dealt the followers of so precious, so glorious, so  potent a Faith failed, however, to assuage the animosity that inflamed its  persecutors. Nor did the deliberate and mischievous misrepresentations of  its fundamental teachings, its aims and purposes, its hopes and  aspirations, its institutions and activities, suffice to stay the hand of  the oppressor and the calumniator, who sought by every means in their  power to abolish its name and extirpate its system. The hand which had  struck down so vast a number of its blameless and humble lovers and  servants was now raised to deal its Founders the heaviest and cruelest  blows.    The Bab--\"the Point,\" as affirmed by Baha'u'llah, \"round Whom the realities  of the Prophets and Messengers revolve\"--was the One first swept into the  maelstrom which engulfed His supporters. Sudden arrest and confinement in  the very first year of His short and spectacular career; public affront  deliberately inflicted in the presence of the ecclesiastical dignitaries  of _Sh_iraz; strict and prolonged incarceration in the bleak fastnesses of  the mountains of A_dh_irbayjan; a contemptuous disregard and a cowardly  jealousy evinced respectively by the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19284"],[0,"Paris Talks (#2)"],[1,"God! There are two causes for sickness, one is  material, the other spiritual. If the sickness is of the body, a material  remedy is needed, if of the soul, a spiritual remedy.    If the heavenly benediction be upon us while we are being healed then only  can we be made whole, for medicine is but the outward and visible means  through which we obtain the heavenly healing. Unless the spirit be healed,  the cure of the body is worth nothing. All is in the hands of God, and  without Him there can be no health in us!    There have been many men who have died at last of the very disease of  which they have made a special study. Aristotle, for instance, who made a  special study of the digestion, died of a gastronomic malady. Aviseu was a  specialist of the heart, but he died of heart disease. God is the great  compassionate Physician who alone has the power to give true healing.    All creatures are dependent upon God, however great may seem their  knowledge, power and independence.    Behold the mighty kings upon earth, for they have all the power in the  world that man can give them, and yet when death calls they must obey,  even as the peasants at their gates.    Look also at the animals, how helpless they are in their apparent  strength! For the elephant, the largest of all animals, is troubled by the  fly, and the lion cannot escape the irritation of the worm. Even man, the  highest form of created beings, needs many things for his very life; first  of all he needs air, and if he is deprived of it for a few minutes, he  dies. He is also dependent on water, food, clothing, warmth, and many  other things. On all sides he is surrounded by dangers and difficulties,  against which his physical body alone cannot cope. If a man looks at the  world around him, he will see how all created things are dependent and are  captive to the laws of Nature.    Man alone, by his spiritual power, has been able to free himself, to soar  above the world of matter and to make it his servant.    Without the help of God man is even as the beasts that perish, but God has  bestowed such wonderful power upon him that he might ever look upward, and  receive, among other gifts, healing from His divine Bounty.    But alas! man is not grateful for this supreme good, but sleeps the sleep  of negligence, being careless of the great mercy which God has shown  towards him, turning his face away from the light and going on his way in  darkness.    It is my earnest prayer, that ye be not like unto this, but rather that ye  keep your faces steadfastly turned to the light, so that ye may be as  lighted torches in the dark places of life.          THE NEED FOR UNION BETWEEN THE PEOPLES OF THE EAST AND WEST      Friday, October 20th    'Abdu'l-Baha said:    In the past, as in the present, the Spiritual Sun of Truth has always  shone from the horizon of the East.    Abraham appeared in the East. In the East Moses arose to lead and teach  the people. On the Eastern horizon arose the Lord Christ. Muhammad was  sent to an Eastern nation. The Bab arose in the Eastern land of Persia.  Baha'u'llah lived and taught in the East. All the great Spiritual Teachers  arose in the Eastern world. But although the Sun of Christ dawned in the  East the radiance thereof was apparent in the West, where the effulgence  of its glory was more clearly seen. The divine light of His Teaching shone  with a greater force in the Western world, where it has made a more rapid  headway than in the land of its birth.    In these days the East is in need of material progress and the West is in  want of a spiritual idea. It would be well for the West to turn to the  East for illumination, and to give in exchange its scientific knowledge.  There must be this interchange of gifts.    The East and the West must unite to give to each other what is lacking.  This union will bring about a true civilization, where the spiritual is  expressed and carried out in the material.    Receiving thus the one from the other the greatest harmony will prevail,  all people will be united, a state of great perfection will be attained,  there will be a firm cementing, and this world will become a shining  mirror for the reflection of the attributes of God.    We all, the Eastern with the Western nations, must strive day and night  with heart and soul to achieve this high ideal, to cement the unity  between all the nations of the earth. Every heart will then be refreshed,  all eyes will be opened, the most wonderful power will be given, the  happiness of humanity will be assured.    We must pray that by the Bounty of God, Persia will be enabled to receive  the material and mental civilization of the West, and by Divine Grace to  give in return her spiritual light. The devoted energetic work of the  united peoples, occidentals and orientals, will succeed in establishing  this result, for the force of the Holy Spirit will aid them.    The principles of the Teachings of Baha'u'llah should be carefully  studied, one by one, until they are realized and understood by mind and  heart--so will you become strong followers of the light, truly spiritual,  heavenly soldiers of God, acquiring and spreading the true civilization in  Persia, in Europe, and in the whole world.    This will be the paradise which is to come on earth, when all mankind will  be gathered together under the tent of unity in the Kingdom of Glory.          GOD COMPREHENDS ALL: HE CANNOT BE COMPREHENDED      Friday evening, October 20th    'Abdu'l-Baha said:    Numerous meetings are held in Paris every day for different purposes, to  discuss politics, commerce, education, art, science and many other  subjects.    All these meetings are good: but this assembly has met together to turn  their faces towards God, to learn how best to work for the good of  humanity, to seek how prejudices may be abolished, and the seed of love  and universal brotherhood sown in the heart of man.    God approves of the motive of our gathering together and gives us His  blessing.    In the Old Testament we read that God said, 'Let us make man in Our own  image'. In the Gospel, Christ said, 'I am in the Father, and the Father in  Me'.(1) In the Qur'an, God says, 'Man is my Mystery and I am his'.  Baha'u'llah writes that God says, 'Thy heart is My home; purify it for My  descent. Thy spirit is My place of revelation; cleanse it for My  manifestation'.    All these sacred words show us that man is made in God's image: yet the  Essence of God is incomprehensible to the human mind, for the finite  understanding cannot be applied to this infinite Mystery. God contains  all: He cannot be contained. That which contains is superior to that which  is contained. The whole is greater than its parts.    Things which are understood by men cannot be outside their capacity for  understanding, so that it is impossible for the heart of man to comprehend  the nature of the Majesty of God. Our imagination can only picture that  which it is able to create.    The power of the understanding differs in degree in the various kingdoms  of creation. The mineral, vegetable, and animal realms are each incapable  of understanding any creation beyond their own. The mineral cannot imagine  the growing power of the plant. The tree cannot understand the power of  movement in the animal, neither can it comprehend what it would mean to  possess sight, hearing or the sense of smell. These all belong to the  physical creation.    Man also shares in this creation; but it is not possible for either of the  lower kingdoms to understand that which takes place in the mind of man.  The animal cannot realize the intelligence of a human being, he only knows  that which is perceived by his animal senses, he cannot imagine anything  in the abstract. An animal could not learn that the world is round, that  the earth revolves round the sun, or the construction of the electric  telegraph. These things are only possible to man. Man is the highest work  of creation, the nearest to God of all creatures.    All superior kingdoms are incomprehensible to the inferior; how therefore  could it be possible that the creature, man, should understand the  almighty Creator of all?    That which we imagine, is not the Reality of God; He, the Unknowable, the  Unthinkable, is far beyond the highest conception of man.    All creatures that exist are dependent upon the Divine Bounty. Divine  Mercy gives life itself. As the light of the sun shines on the whole  world, so the Mercy of the infinite God is shed on all creatures. As the  sun ripens the fruits of the earth, and gives life and warmth to all  living beings, so shines the Sun of Truth on all souls, filling them with  the fire of Divine love and understanding.    The superiority of man over the rest of the created world is seen again in  this, that man has a soul in which dwells the divine spirit; the souls of  the lower creatures are inferior in their essence.    There is no doubt then, that of all created beings man is the nearest to  the nature of God, and therefore receives a greater gift of the Divine  Bounty.    The mineral kingdom possesses the power of existing. The plant has the  power of existing and growing. The animal, in addition to existence and  growth, has the capacity of moving about, and the use of the faculties of  the senses. In the human kingdom we find all the attributes of the lower  worlds, with much more added thereto. Man is the sum of every previous  creation, for he contains them all.    To man is given the special gift of the intellect by which he is able to  receive a larger share of the light Divine. The Perfect Man is as a  polished mirror reflecting the Sun of Truth, manifesting the attributes of  God.    The Lord Christ said, 'He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father'--God  manifested in man.    The sun does not leave his place in the heavens and descend into the  mirror, for the actions of ascent and descent, coming and going, do not  belong "]]]
