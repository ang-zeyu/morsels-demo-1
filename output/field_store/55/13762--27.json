To  disturb the police at nine o'clock in the evening: there's a notion for  you!\"    He set to work again. It took longer than he expected, for they  discovered in the cupboards all sorts of valuable knick-knacks which it  would have been very wrong to disdain and, on the other hand, Vaucheray  and Gilbert were going about their investigations with signs of laboured  concentration that nonplussed him.    At long last, he lost his patience:    \"That will do!\" he said. \"We're not going to spoil the whole job and  keep the motor waiting for the sake of the few odd bits that remain. I'm  taking the boat.\"    They were now by the waterside and Lupin went down the steps. Gilbert  held him back:    \"I say, governor, we want one more look round five minutes, no longer.\"    \"But what for, dash it all?\"    \"Well, it's like this: we were told of an old reliquary, something  stunning...\"    \"Well?\"    \"We can't lay our hands on it. And I was thinking... There's a cupboard  with a big lock to it in the pantry... You see, we can't very well...\"  He was already on his way to the villa. Vaucheray ran back too.    \"I'll give you ten minutes, not a second longer!\" cried Lupin. \"In ten  minutes, I'm off.\"    But the ten minutes passed and he was still waiting.    He looked at his watch:    \"A quarter-past nine,\" he said to himself. \"This is madness.\"    And he also remembered that Gilbert and Vaucheray had behaved rather  queerly throughout the removal of the things, keeping close together and  apparently watching each other. What could be happening?    Lupin mechanically returned to the house, urged by a feeling of anxiety  which he was unable to explain; and, at the same time, he listened to  a dull sound which rose in the distance, from the direction of Enghien,  and which seemed to be coming nearer... People strolling about, no  doubt...    He gave a sharp whistle and then went to the main gate, to take a glance  down the avenue. But, suddenly, as he was opening the gate, a shot rang  out, followed by a yell of pain. He returned at a run, went round the  house, leapt up the steps and rushed to the dining-room:    \"Blast it all, what are you doing there, you two?\"    Gilbert and Vaucheray, locked in a furious embrace, were rolling on the  floor, uttering cries of rage. Their clothes were dripping with blood.  Lupin flew at them to separate them. But already Gilbert had got his  adversary down and was wrenching out of his hand something which Lupin  had no time to see. And Vaucheray, who was losing blood through a wound  in the shoulder, fainted.    \"Who hurt him? You, Gilbert?\" asked Lupin, furiously.    \"No, Leonard.\"    \"Leonard? Why, he was tied up!\"    \"He undid his fastenings and got hold of his revolver.\"    \"The scoundrel! Where is he?\"    Lupin took the lamp and went into the pantry.    The man-servant was lying on his back, with his arms outstretched, a  dagger stuck in his throat and a livid face. A red stream trickled from  his mouth.    \"Ah,\" gasped Lupin, after examining him, \"he's dead!\"    \"Do you think so?... Do you think so?\" stammered Gilbert, in a trembling  voice.    \"He's dead, I tell you.\"    \"It was Vaucheray... it was Vaucheray who did it...\"    Pale with anger, Lupin caught hold of him:    \"It was Vaucheray, was it?... And you too, you blackguard, since you  were there and didn't stop him! Blood! Blood! You know I won't have  it... Well, it's a bad lookout for you, my fine fellows... You'll have  to pay the damage! And you won't get off cheaply either... Mind the  guillotine!\" And, shaking him violently, \"What was it? Why did he kill  him?\"    \"He wanted to go through his pockets and take the key of the cupboard  from him. When he stooped over him, he saw that the man unloosed his  arms. He got frightened... and he stabbed him...\"    \"But the revolver-shot?\"    \"It was Leonard... he had his revolver in his hand... he just had  strength to take aim before he died...\"    \"And the key of the cupboard?\"    \"Vaucheray took it....\"    \"Did he open it?\"    \"And did he find what he was after?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"And you wanted to take the thing from him. What sort of thing was  it? The reliquary? No, it was too small for that.... Then what was it?  Answer me, will you?...\"    Lupin gathered from Gilbert's silence and the determined expression on  his face that he would not obtain a reply. With a threatening gesture,  \"I'll make you talk, my man. Sure as my name's Lupin, you shall come out  with it. But, for the moment, we must see about decamping. Here, help  me. We must get Vaucheray into the boat...\"    They had returned to the dining-room and Gilbert was bending over the  wounded man, when Lupin stopped him:    \"Listen.\"    They exchanged one look of alarm... Some one was speaking in the pantry  ... a very low, strange, very distant voice... Nevertheless, as they at  once made certain, there was no one in the room, no one except the dead  man, whose dark outline lay stretched upon the floor.    And the voice spake anew, by turns shrill, stifled, bleating,  stammering, yelling, fearsome. It uttered indistinct words, broken  syllables.    Lupin felt the top of his head covering with perspiration. What was this  incoherent voice, mysterious as a voice from beyond the grave?    He had knelt down by the man-servant's side. The voice was silent and  then began again:    \"Give us a better light,\" he said to Gilbert.    He was trembling a little, shaken with a nervous dread which he was  unable to master, for there was no doubt possible: when Gilbert had  removed the shade from the lamp, Lupin realized that the voice issued  from the corpse itself, without a movement of the lifeless mass, without  a quiver of the bleeding mouth.    \"Governor, I've got the shivers,\" stammered Gilbert.    Again the same voice, the same snuffling whisper.    Suddenly, Lupin burst out laughing, seized the corpse and pulled it  aside:    \"Exactly!\" he said, catching sight of an object made of polished metal.  \"Exactly! That's it!... Well, upon my word, it took me long enough!\"    On the spot on the floor which he had uncovered lay the receiver of a  telephone, the cord of which ran up to the apparatus fixed on the wall,  at the usual height.    Lupin put the receiver to his ear. The noise began again at once, but  it was a mixed noise, made up of different calls, exclamations, confused  cries, the noise produced by a number of persons questioning one another  at the same time.    \"Are you there?... He won't answer. It's awful... They must have killed  him. What is it?... Keep up your courage. There's help on the way...  police... soldiers...\"    \"Dash it!\" said Lupin, dropping the receiver.    The truth appeared to him in a terrifying vision. Quite at the  beginning, while the things upstairs were being moved, Leonard, whose  bonds were not securely fastened, had contrived to scramble to his  feet, to unhook the receiver, probably with his teeth, to drop it and to  appeal for assistance to the Enghien telephone-exchange.    And those were the words which Lupin had overheard, after the first boat  started:    \"Help!... Murder!... I shall be killed!\"    And this was the reply of the exchange. The police were hurrying to  the spot. And Lupin remembered the sounds which he had heard from the  garden, four or five minutes earlier, at most:    \"The police! Take to your heels!\" he shouted, darting across the dining  room.    \"What about Vaucheray?\" asked Gilbert.    \"Sorry, can't be helped!\"    But Vaucheray, waking from his torpor, entreated him as he passed:    \"Governor, you wouldn't leave me like this!\"    Lupin stopped, in spite of the danger, and was lifting the wounded man,  with Gilbert's assistance, when a loud din arose outside:    \"Too late!\" he said.    At that moment, blows shook the hall-door at the back of the house. He  ran to the front steps: a number of men had already turned the corner of  the house at a rush. He might have managed to keep ahead of them, with  Gilbert, and reach the waterside. But what chance was there of embarking  and escaping under the enemy's fire?    He locked and bolted the door.    \"We are surrounded... and done for,\" spluttered Gilbert.    \"Hold your tongue,\" said Lupin.    \"But they've seen us, governor. There, they're knocking.\"    \"Hold your tongue,\" Lupin repeated. \"Not a word. Not a movement.\"    He himself remained unperturbed, with an utterly calm face and the  pensive attitude of one who has all the time that he needs to examine a  delicate situation from every point of view. He had reached one of those  minutes which he called the \"superior moments of existence,\" those  which alone give a value and a price to life. On such occasions,  however threatening the danger, he always began by counting to himself,  slowly--\"One... Two... Three... Four.... Five... Six\"--until the beating  of his heart became normal and regular. Then and not till then, he  reflected, but with what intensity, with what perspicacity, with what a  profound intuition of possibilities! All the factors of the problem were  present in his mind. He foresaw everything. He admitted everything. And  he took his resolution in all logic and in all certainty.    After thirty or forty seconds, while the men outside were banging at the  doors and picking the locks, he said to his companion:    \"Follow me.\"    Returning to the dining-room, he softly opened the sash and drew the  Venetian blinds of a window in the side-wall. People were coming and  going, rendering flight out of the question.    Thereupon he began to shout with all his might, in a breathless voice:    \"This way!... Help!... I've got them!... This way!\"    He pointed his revolver and fired two shots into the tree-tops. Then  he went back to Vaucheray, bent over him and smeared his face and hands  with the wounded man's blood. Lastly, turning upon Gilbert, he took him  violently by the shoulders and threw him to the floor.    \"What do you"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15636"],[0,"The Future of Astronomy (#2)"],[1,"States. Not a single mathematician, or doctor, from this country  appears on the list. Only in astronomy are we well represented. Out of a  total of ten astronomers, four come from England, and three from the  United States. Comparing the results for the last one hundred and fifty  years, we find an extraordinary growth for the German races, an equally  surprising diminution for the French and other Latin races, while the  proportion of Englishmen has remained unchanged.    A popular method of expending money, both by countries and by  individuals, is in sending expeditions to observe solar eclipses. These  appeal both to donors and recipients. The former believe that they are  making a great contribution to science, while the latter enjoy a long  voyage to a distant country, and in case of clouds they are not expected  to make any scientific return. If the sky is clear at the time of the  eclipse, the newspapers of the next day report that great results have  been secured, and after that nothing further is ever heard. Exceptions  should be made of the English Eclipse Committee and the Lick  Observatory, which, by long continued study and observation, are  gradually solving the difficult problems which can be reached in this  way only.    The gift of a large telescope to a university is of very doubtful value,  unless it is accompanied, first, by a sum much greater than its cost,  necessary to keep it employed in useful work, and secondly, to require  that it shall be erected, not on the university grounds, but in some  region, probably mountainous or desert, where results of real value can  be obtained.    Having thus considered, among others, some of the ways in which  astronomy is not likely to be much advanced, we proceed to those which  will secure the greatest scientific return for the outlay. One of the  best of these is to create a fund to be used in advancing research,  subject only to the condition that results of the greatest possible  value to science shall be secured. One advantage of this method is that  excellent results may be obtained at once from a sum, either large or  small. Whatever is at first given may later be increased indefinitely,  if the results justify it. One of the wisest as well as the greatest of  donors has said: \"Find the particular man,\" but unfortunately, this plan  has been actually tried only with some of the smaller funds. Any one who  will read the list of researches aided by the Rumford Fund, the  Elizabeth Thompson Fund or the Bruce Fund of 1890 will see that the  returns are out of all proportion to the money expended. The trustees of  such a fund as is here proposed should not regard themselves as patrons  conferring a favor on those to whom grants are made, but as men seeking  for the means of securing large scientific returns for the money  entrusted to them. An astronomer who would aid them in this work, by  properly expending a grant, would confer rather than receive a favor.  They should search for astronomical bargains, and should try to purchase  results where the money could be expended to the best advantage. They  should make it their business to learn of the work of every astronomer  engaged in original research. A young man who presented a paper of  unusual importance at a scientific meeting, or published it in an  astronomical journal, would receive a letter inviting him to submit  plans to the trustees, if he desired aid in extending his work. In many  cases, it would be found that, after working for years under most  unfavorable conditions, he had developed a method of great value and had  applied it to a few stars, but must now stop for want of means. A small  appropriation would enable him to employ an assistant who, in a short  time, could do equally good work. The application of this method to a  hundred or a thousand stars would then be only a matter of time and  money.    The American Astronomical Society met last August at a summer resort on  Lake Erie. About thirty astronomers read papers, and in a large portion  of the cases the appropriation of a few hundred dollars would have  permitted a great extension in these researches. A sad case is that of a  brilliant student who may graduate at a college, take a doctor's degree  in astronomy, and perhaps pass a year or two in study at a foreign  observatory. He then returns to this country, enthusiastic and full of  ideas, and considers himself fortunate in securing a position as  astronomer in a little country college. He now finds himself overwhelmed  with work as a teacher, without time or appliances for original work.  What is worse, no one sympathizes with him in his aspirations, and after  a few years he abandons hope and settles down to the dull routine of  lectures, recitations and examinations. A little encouragement at the  right time, aid by offering to pay for an assistant, for a suitable  instrument, or for publishing results, and perhaps a word to the  president of his college if the man showed real genius, might make a  great astronomer, instead of a poor teacher. For several years, a small  fund, yielding a few hundred dollars annually, has been disbursed at  Harvard in this way, with very encouraging results.    A second method of aiding astronomy is through the large observatories.  These institutions, if properly managed, have after years of careful  study and trial developed elaborate systems of solving the great  problems of the celestial universe. They are like great factories, which  by taking elaborate precautions to save waste at every point, and by  improving in every detail both processes and products, are at length  obtaining results on a large scale with a perfection and economy far  greater than is possible by individuals, or smaller institutions. The  expenses of such an observatory are very large, and it has no pecuniary  return, since astronomical products are not salable. A great portion of  the original endowment has been spent on the plant, expensive buildings  and instruments. Current expenditures, like library expenses, heating,  lighting, etc., are independent of the output. It is like a man swimming  up stream. He may struggle desperately, and yet make no progress. Any  gain in power effects a real advance. This is the condition of nearly  all the larger observatories. Their income is mainly used for current  expenses, which would be nearly the same whatever their output. A  relatively small increase in income can thus be spent to great  advantage. The principal instruments are rarely used to their full  capacities, and the methods employed could be greatly extended without  any addition to the executive or other similar expenses. A man  superintending the work of several assistants can often have their  number doubled, and his output increased in nearly the same proportion,  with no additional expense except the moderate one of their salaries. A  single observatory could thus easily do double the work that could be  accomplished if its resources were divided between two of half the  size.    A third, and perhaps the best, method of making a real advance in  astronomy is by securing the united work of the leading astronomers of  the world. The best example of this is the work undertaken in 1870 by  the Astronomische Gesellschaft, the great astronomical society of the  world. The sky was divided into zones, and astronomers were invited to  measure the positions of all the stars in these zones. The observation  of two of the northern and two of the southern zones were undertaken by  American observatories. The zone from +1 deg. to +5 deg. was undertaken by the  Chicago Observatory, but was abandoned owing to the great fire of 1871,  and the work was assumed and carried to completion by the Dudley  Observatory at Albany. The zone from +50 deg. to +55 deg. was undertaken by  Harvard. An observer and corps of assistants worked on this problem for  a quarter of a century. The completed results now fill seven quarto  volumes of our annals. Of the southern zones, that from -14 deg. to -18 deg. was  undertaken by the Naval Observatory at Washington, and is now finished.  The zone from -10 deg. to -14 deg. was undertaken at Harvard, and a second  observer and corps of assistants have been working on it for twenty  years. It is now nearly completed, and we hope to begin its publication  this year. The other zones were taken by European astronomers. As a  result of the whole, we have the precise positions of nearly a hundred  and fifty thousand stars, which serve as a basis for the places of all  the objects in the sky.    Another example of cooperative work is a plan proposed by the writer in  1906, at the celebration of the two-hundredth anniversary of the birth  of Franklin. It was proposed, first to find the best place in the world  for an astronomical observatory, which would probably be in South  Africa, to erect there a telescope of the largest size, a reflector of  seven feet aperture. This instrument should be kept at work throughout  every clear night, taking photographs according to a plan recommended by  an international committee of astronomers. The resulting plates should  not be regarded as belonging to a single institution, but should be at  the service of whoever could make the best use of them. Copies of any,  or all, would be furnished at cost to any one who wished for them. As an  example of their use, suppose that an astronomer at a little German  University should discover a law regulating the stars in clusters.  Perhaps he has only a small telescope, near the smoke and haze of a  large city, and has no means of securing the photographs he needs. He  would apply to the committee, and they would vote that ten photographs  of twenty clusters, each with an exposure of an hour, should be taken  with the large telescope. This would occupy about a tenth part of the  time of the telescope for a year. After making copies, the photographs  would be sent"]]]
