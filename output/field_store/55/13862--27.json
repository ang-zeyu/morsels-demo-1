[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17332"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 12 (of 12) (#2)"],[1,"means rare to see a Christian ruler call  upon Moslem warriors to assist him against his adversary. Pope Gregory  rescued Rome from the hands of his imperial opponent, Henry of Germany,  only with the aid of the Saracen soldiers.    When, therefore, the influence of Muhammedanism began to assert itself  throughout the south of Europe, it was natural that in a crude and  stirring age, when strife was the dominant passion of the people, the  idea of a holy war in the cause of faith was one in which Christian  Europe was ready to take an example from the followers of Islam. The  political, economical, and social state of affairs, the misery and  suffering of the people, and even the hierarchy and the ascetic spirit  of the time certainly made the minds of the people accessible to the  idea of war; the spirit of unrest was pervasive and the time was ripe,  but the influence of Islam was a prominent factor in giving to it an  entirely religious aspect.    But even in the means employed to incite the Christian warriors and  the manner in which the Crusades were carried on, there is a great  similarity between the Christian and the Muhammedan procedure. The  Church, when espousing the cause of the Crusader, did exactly what  Muhammed had done when he preached a holy war. The Church addressed  itself to the weaknesses and passions of human nature. Fallen in  battle, the Moslem, so he was told, would be admitted--be he victor  or vanquished--to the joys of Paradise. The same prospect animated  the Crusader and made him brave danger and die joyfully in defence of  Christianity. \"Let them kill the enemy or die. To submit to die for  Christ, or to cause one of His enemies to die, is naught but glory,\"  said Saint Bernard. Eloquently, vividly, and in glowing colours were  the riches that awaited the warriors in the far East described: immense  spoil would be taken from the unbelievers. Preachers did not even shrink  from extolling the beauty of the women in the lands to be conquered.  This fact recalls Muhammed's promise to his believers that they would  meet the ever-beautiful dark-eyed houris in the life after death. To the  material, sensual allurements, the Church added spiritual blessings and  eternal rewards, guaranteed to those who took the red cross. During the  Crusades the Christians did their utmost to copy the cruelties of the  Moslems. That contempt for human life, that entire absence of mercy and  the sense of pity which is familiar in all countries where Islam has  gained sway is characteristic also of the Crusades.    Although the narrative of the Crusades belongs rather to the history of  Europe than of any one country, it is so closely intertwined with the  history of Egypt at this period that some digression is necessary. About  twenty years after the conquest of Jerusalem by the Turks, in 1076, the  Holy Sepulchre was visited by a hermit of the name of Peter, a native of  Amiens, in the province of Picardy, France. His resentment and sympathy  were excited by his own injuries and the oppression of the Christian  name; he mingled his tears with those of the Patriarch, and earnestly  inquired if no hope of relief from the Greek emperors of the East could  be entertained. The Patriarch exposed the vices and weakness of the  successors of Constantine. \"I will rouse,\" exclaimed the hermit, \"the  martial nations of Europe in your cause;\" and Europe was obedient to the  call of the hermit. The astonished Patriarch dismissed him with epistles  of credit and complaint; and no sooner did he land at Bari than Peter  hastened to kiss the feet of the Roman pontiff. Pope Urban II. received  him as a prophet, applauded his glorious design, promised to support it  in a general council, and encouraged him to proclaim the deliverance  of the Holy Land. Invigorated by the approbation of the pontiff, this  zealous missionary traversed with speed and success the provinces of  Italy and France. He preached to innumerable crowds in the churches, the  streets, and the highways: the hermit entered with equal confidence the  palace and the cottage; and the people of all classes were impetuously  moved by his call to repentance and arms.    The first Crusade was headed by Godefroy de Bouillon, Duke of Lower  Lorraine; Baldwin, his brother; Hugo the Great, brother of the King of  France; Robert, Duke of Normandy, son of William the Conqueror; Raymond  of St. Gilles, Duke of Toulouse; and Bohemond, Prince of Tarentum.  Towards the end of 1097 A.D. the invading force invested Antioch, and,  after a siege of nine months, took it by storm. Edessa was also captured  by the Crusaders, and in the middle of the summer of 1098 they reached  Jerusalem, then in the hands of the Fatimites.    El-Mustali b'Illah Abu'l Kasim, son of Mustanssir, was then on the  throne, but he was only a nominal ruler, for El-Afdhal, a son of  El-Gemali, had the chief voice in the affairs of the kingdom. It was the  army of Kasim that had captured Jerusalem. The city was besieged by the  Crusaders, and it surrendered to them after forty days. Twice did new  expeditions arrive from Egypt and attempt to retake the city, but with  disastrous results, and further expeditions were impossible for some  time, owing to the internal disorders in Egypt. Mustali died after  a reign of about four years; and some historians record, as a truly  remarkable circumstance, that he was a Sunnite by creed, although he  represented a Shiite dynasty.    The next ruler, El-Amir, was the five-year-old son of Mustali, and  El-Afdhal conducted the government until he became of age to govern.  His first act was to put El-Afdhal to death. Under El-Amir the internal  condition of Egypt continued unsatisfactory, and the Crusaders, who had  been very successful in capturing the towns of Syria, were only deterred  from an advance on Egypt by the death of their leader, Baldwin. In  a.h. 524, some of the surviving partisans of El-Afdhal, it is said,  put El-Amir to death, and a son of El-Afdhal assumed the direction of  affairs, and appointed El-Hafiz, a grandson of Mustanssir as caliph.  Afdual's son, whose name was Abu Ali Ahmed, perished in a popular  tumult. The new caliph had great trouble with his next three viziers,  and at length abolished the office altogether. After reigning twenty  years, he was succeeded by his licentious son, Dhafir, whose faults led  to his death at the hand of his vizier, El-Abbas.    For the ensuing six years the supreme power in Egypt was mainly the bone  of contention between rival viziers, although El-Faiz, a boy of five,  was nominally elected caliph on the death of Dhafir. El-Abbas was  worsted by his rival, Tatae, and fled to Syria with a large sum of  money; but he fell into the hands of the Crusaders, was returned to  Tatae, and crucified.    [Illustration: 013.jpg ENAMELLED GLASS CUP FROM ARABIA]    The last of the Fatimite caliphs, El-Adid, in 555 a.h., was raised to  the throne by Tatae, but his power was merely the shadow of sovereignty.  Tatae's tyranny, however, became so odious that the caliph had him  assassinated a year after his accession, but he concealed the fact that  he had instigated the murder. The caliph appointed Tatae's son, El-Adil,  as vizier in his stead. The governorship of Upper Egypt was at this time  in the hands of the celebrated Shawir, whom El-Adil dispossessed, but  in a test of battle, El-Adil was defeated and put to death. In his turn,  Shawir yielded to the more powerful Ed-Durghan, and fled to Damascus.  There he enlisted the aid of the Atabeg Sultan Nur ed-Din, who sent his  army against Ed-Durghan, with the result that Shawir was reinstated in  power in Egypt. He thereupon threw off his promised allegiance to Nur  ed-Din, whose general, Shirkuh (who had led the Damascenes to Egypt),  took up a strategic position. Shawir appealed for aid to the Crusaders,  and with the help of Amaury, King of Jerusalem, Shawir besieged his  friend Shirkuh. Nur ed-Din was successfully attacking the Crusaders  elsewhere, and in the end a peace was negotiated, and the Damascenes  left Egypt.    Two years later, Nur ed-Din formulated a plan to punish the rebellious  Shawir. Persecuted by Shirkuh, Nur ed-Din sent him with his army into  Egypt. The Franks now joined with Shawir to defend the country, hoping  thereby to baffle the schemes of Nur ed-Din. The Christian army was  amazed at all the splendour of the caliph's palace at Cairo. Shawir  retreated to entice the invaders on, who, advancing beyond their base,  were soon reduced to straits. Shirkuh then tried to come to terms with  Shawir against the Christians as a common foe, but without success.  He next thought of retreating, without fighting, with all his Egyptian  plunder. Persuaded at length to fight, he defeated the Franks and  finally came to terms with Shawir, whereby the Franco-Egyptian alliance  came to an end, and he then left Egypt on receiving an indemnity, Shawir  still remaining its ruler.    [Illustration: 015.jpg GATE OF EL FUTUH AT CAIRO]    The peace, however, did not last long, and Nur ed-Din sent Shirkuh again  with many Frankish free-lancers against the ill-fated country. On the  approach of the army towards Cairo, the vizier set fire to the ancient  city of Fostat, to prevent it from falling into the hands of the  invaders, and it burned continually for fifty days. El-Adid now sought  aid of Nur ed-Din, who, actuated by zeal against the Franks, and by  desire of conquest, once more despatched Shirkuh. In the meantime  negotiations had been opened with Amaury to raise the siege of Cairo on  payment of an enormous sum of money. But, before these conditions  had been fulfilled, the approach of the Syrian army induced Amaury  to retreat in haste. Shirkuh and Saladin entered the capital in  great state, and were received with honour by the caliph, and  with obsequiousness by Shawir, who was contriving a plot which was  fortunately discovered, and for which he paid"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17334"],[0,"Initiative Psychic Energy (#2)"],[1," the success of which he largely contributed:    \"My poor wife had some reason to think that war and disease, between  them, had left very little of a husband to take under nursing when she  got him again. An attack of scurvy had filled my mouth with sores,  shaken every joint in my body and covered me all over with scars and  livid spots, so that I was unlovely to look upon. A smart knock on the  ankle joint from the splinter of a shell that burst in my face, in  itself a mere bagatelle of a wound, had been of necessity neglected  under the pressing and insistent calls upon me, and had grown worse  and worse until the whole foot below the ankle became a black mass and  seemed to threaten mortification. I insisted, however, on being  allowed to use it until the place was taken, mortification or no; and  though the pain was sometimes horrible I carried my point and kept up  to the last.    \"On the day after the assault I had an unlucky fall on some bad  ground, and it was an open question for a day or two whether I hadn't  broken my arm at the elbow. Fortunately it turned out to be only a  severe sprain, but I am still conscious of the wrench it gave me. To  crown the whole pleasant catalogue, I was worn to a shadow by a  constant diarrhoea and consumed as much opium as would have done  credit to my father-in-law (Thomas De Quincey).    \"However, thank God, I have a good share of Tapleyism in me and come  out strong under difficulties. I think I may confidently say that no  man ever saw me out of heart or ever heard a complaining word from me  even when our prospects were gloomiest. We were sadly crippled by  cholera, and it was almost appalling to me to find that out of  twenty-seven officers I could only muster fifteen for the operations  of the attack. However, it was done,--and after it was done came the  collapse.    [Sidenote: _Enduring Power of Mind_]    \"Don't be horrified when I tell you that for the whole of the actual  siege, and in truth for some little time before, I almost lived on  brandy. Appetite for food I had none, but I forced myself to eat just  sufficient to sustain life, and I had an incessant craving for brandy,  as the strongest stimulant I could get. Strange to say, I was quite  unconscious of its affecting me in the slightest degree.    \"_The excitement of the work was so great that no lesser one seemed to  have any chance against it, and I certainly never found my intellect  clearer or my nerves stronger in my life._\"    Such is the profound resourcefulness and enduring power of the human  mind.          CHAPTER II    RESERVES OF POWER      [Sidenote: _Man's Potential and Kinetic Energies_]    Stored-up energy not in use has been given a name by scientific men.  They call it _potential energy_. In this way it is distinguished from  _kinetic_ or circulating energy by which is meant energy that is at  work. For example, a ton of coal in the bin contains a certain amount  of potential energy, which is capable of being converted into kinetic  energy by combustion.    [Sidenote: _Holding the Top Pace_]    You have a vast amount of potential energy over and above what you  actually use. You have formed the habit of giving up trying a thing as  soon as you have spent the usual amount of effort on it, and this  without regard to whether or not you have accomplished anything.    While we all have the power of sustained mental activity, not one in  ten thousand of us holds to the top pace.    Worse still, even such mental energy as we do consume is dispersed and  scattered over a multitude of trivial interests instead of being  focused upon some one possessing aim.    _We intend to show you how you can lose yourself in your work with an  absorbing passion and how you can at any time make special requisition  upon your hidden stores of potential energy and draw new supplies of  power that will sweep you on to your goal._    [Sidenote: _Genius and the Master Man_]    More than anything else, it is the ability to do this that lifts the  great men of the race above the common run of mortals.    It is this that distinguishes genius from mediocrity. The master man  transforms his vast stores of reserve or potential energy into  circulating or kinetic energy. His work glows with living fire.    Yet, for every such man there are a multitude of others, equally  gifted in some respect, but wanting that mysterious \"Open Sesame\"  which would discover their hidden mental riches, arouse them from  their accustomed inferiority to their best selves, and transform  potentiality into accomplishment. So it comes about that most of us  are gems that shine but to illumine the \"dark unfathomed caves of  ocean,\" flowers born to \"blush unseen.\"    [Sidenote: _Mental Effect of City Life_]    Take an illustration of the way in which this reserve or potential  energy is transformed into circulating or kinetic energy. Suppose that  you are a countryman and come to live in a large city. The speed with  which we do things, our habits of quick decision, the whirlwind of  activities of the busy man in town, appal you. You cannot see how we  live through it. A day in the business district fills you with terror.  The tumult and danger make it seem \"like a permanent earthquake.\"    But settle down to work here. And in a year you will have \"caught the  pulse beat,\" you will \"vibrate to the city's rhythm,\" and if you only  \"make good\" in your work, you will enjoy the strain and hurry, you  will keep pace with the best of us, and you will get more out of  yourself in a day in the city than you ever did in a week on the farm.    _This change in degree of mental activity does not necessarily mean  that you are making more of a success of life._    Your activities may be ill-directed. Your new-found powers may be  misspent and dissipated.    But you are mentally more alert Your mental forces have been  stimulated by the stirring environment.    [Sidenote: _New-Found Energies Explained_]    And, mark this particularly, _a number of mental pictures will pass  across the screen of your consciousness today in the same time that  one mental image formerly required._    _Now, you have learned that with every idea catalogued in memory,  there is wrapped up and stowed away an associated \"feeling tone\" and  an associated impulse to some particular muscular action._    Assuming this, you must at once see that here is an explanation of  your new-found energy.    Your quickened step, your new-found decisiveness of action, your more  observant eye, your clear-cut speech instead of the former drawling  utterance, your livelier manner, your freshened enthusiasm and  enjoyment of life--all of these are but manifestations of a quickened  intelligence.    [Sidenote: _Quickened Mentality_]    _They are the working out through the motor paths of mental impulses  to muscular action._    And these impulses to muscular action come thronging into  consciousness _because the livelier environment brings about a more  rapid reproduction of memory pictures_.    And here comes a particularly striking fact. One would naturally  suppose that the more energy a man consumed, and the faster he lived,  the more quickly his vitality would be exhausted and the shorter his  life would be.    As a matter of fact, by the divine beneficence of Providence, _your  organism is so ordered as to adapt itself within certain wide limits  to the demands made upon it_.    [Sidenote: _Fast Living and Long Living_]    You may call into play all the stored-up resources of your being and  still not stake everything upon a single throw. For the supply of  mental energy is as inexhaustible as the reservoir of all past  experience, while the supply of physical energy involved in brain and  nerve activity is, like the immortal liver of Prometheus, renewed as  fast as depleted.    Two sets of facts that have been established by elaborate scientific  experiment will convince you of the truth of these propositions.    [Sidenote: _Professor Patrick's Experiments_]    Professor Patrick, of the State University of Iowa, conducted some of  these experiments. He caused three young men to remain awake for four  successive days and nights. They were then allowed to go to sleep, the  purpose of the experiment being to determine just how much time Nature  required to recuperate from the long vigil. They were allowed to sleep  themselves out, and all woke up thoroughly rested. _Yet the one who  slept the longest slept only one-third longer than his customary  night's sleep._    You have doubtless had the same experience yourself many times. It all  goes to show that if we are awake four times as long as usual, we do  not make up for it by sleeping four times as _long_, but four times as  _soundly_, as customary. The hard-working mechanic requires no more  hours of sleep than the corner loafer, the active man of affairs no  more than the dawdler.    [Sidenote: _Ratio Between Repair and Demand_]    _The time of tissue repair is about the same with all men under all  conditions. It is the rate of repair that varies with the demand that  has been put upon the body._    Again, look at the same subject from the standpoint of food supply. On  what you now eat and drink you have a certain average weight. Eat,  digest and assimilate a larger quantity of food and your weight will  increase. This increase will be greatest at the start and will  gradually slow up until you shall have reached the point beyond which  you can gain no more. Given the same hygienic conditions that you have  been accustomed to, you will maintain yourself at the increased weight  on the increased supply of food.    [Sidenote: _Pygmies and Giants_]    Now, all this involves clearly enough a greatly increased rate of  activity on the part of the bodily organs of assimilation and repair.  It is a situation on all fours with that of the countryman whose rate  of brain activity has been stimulated by an increased mental demand.    No man"]]]
