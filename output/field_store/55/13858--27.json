The Litany rises a short distance from the Orontes; it flows at first  through a wide and fertile plain, which soon contracts, however, and  forces it into a channel between the spurs of the Lebanon and the  Galilaean hills. The water thence makes its way between two cliffs of  perpendicular rock, the ravine being in several places so narrow that  the branches of the trees on the opposite sides interlace, and an active  man could readily leap across it. Near Yakhmur some detached rocks  appear to have been arrested in their fall, and, leaning like flying  buttresses against the mountain face, constitute a natural bridge over  the torrent. The basins of the two rivers lie in one valley, extending  eighty leagues in length, divided by an almost imperceptible watershed  into two beds of unequal slope. The central part of the valley is given  up to marshes. It is only towards the south that we find cornfields,  vineyards, plantations of mulberry and olive trees, spread out over the  plain, or disposed in terraces on the hillsides. Towards the north,  the alluvial deposits of, the Orontes have gradually formed a black  and fertile soil, upon which grow luxuriant crops of cereals and other  produce. Cole-Syria, after having generously nourished the Oriental  empires which had preyed upon her, became one of the granaries of the  Roman world, under the capable rule of the Caesars.    Syria is surrounded on all sides by countries of varying aspect and  soil. That to the north, flanked by the Amanos, is a gloomy mountainous  region, with its greatest elevation on the seaboard: it slopes gradually  towards the interior, spreading out into chalky table-lands, dotted over  with bare and rounded hills, and seamed with tortuous valleys which  open out to the Euphrates, the Orontes, or the desert. Vast, slightly  undulating plains succeed the table-lands: the soil is dry and stony,  the streams are few in number and contain but little water. The Sajur  flows into the Euphrates, the Afrin and the Karasu when united yield  their tribute to the Orontes, while the others for the most part pour  their waters into enclosed basins. The Khalus of the Greeks sluggishly  pursues its course southward, and after reluctantly leaving the gardens  of Aleppo, finally loses itself on the borders of the desert in a small  salt lake full of islets: about halfway between the Khalus and the  Euphrates a second salt lake receives the Nahr ed-Dahab, the \"golden  river.\" The climate is mild, and the temperature tolerably uniform. The  sea-breeze which rises every afternoon tempers the summer heat: the  cold in winter is never piercing, except when the south wind blows which  comes from the mountains, and the snow rarely lies on the ground for  more than twenty-four hours. It seldom rains during the autumn and  winter months, but frequent showers fall in the early days of spring.  Vegetation then awakes again, and the soil lends itself to cultivation  in the hollows of the valleys and on the table-lands wherever  irrigation is possible. The ancients dotted these now all but desert  spaces with wells and cisterns; they intersected them with canals,  and covered them with farms and villages, with fortresses and populous  cities. Primaeval forests clothed the slopes of the Amanos, and pinewood  from this region was famous both at Babylon and in the towns of Lower  Chaldaea. The plains produced barley and wheat in enormous quantities,  the vine throve there, the gardens teemed with flowers and fruit, and  pistachio and olive trees grew on every slope. The desert was always  threatening to invade the plain, and gained rapidly upon it whenever  a prolonged war disturbed cultivation, or when the negligence of the  inhabitants slackened the work of defence: beyond the lakes and salt  marshes it had obtained a secure hold. At the present time the greater  part of the country between the Orontes and the Euphrates is nothing  but a rocky table-land, ridged with low hills and dotted over with some  impoverished oases, excepting at the foot of Anti-Lebanon, where two  rivers, fed by innumerable streams, have served to create a garden of  marvellous beauty. The Barada, dashing from cascade to cascade, flows  for some distance through gorges before emerging on the plain: scarcely  has it reached level ground than it widens out, divides, and forms  around Damascus a miniature delta, into which a thousand interlacing  channels carry refreshment and fertility. Below the town these streams  rejoin the river, which, after having flowed merrily along for a day's  journey, is swallowed up in a kind of elongated chasm from whence it  never again emerges. At the melting of the snows a regular lake is  formed here, whose blue waters are surrounded by wide grassy margins  \"like a sapphire set in emeralds.\" This lake dries up almost completely  in summer, and is converted into swampy meadows, filled with gigantic  rushes, among which the birds build their nests, and multiply as  unmolested as in the marshes of Chaldaea. The Awaj, unfed by any  tributary, fills a second deeper though smaller basin, while to  the south two other lesser depressions receive the waters of the  Anti-Lebanon and the Hauran. Syria is protected from the encroachments  of the desert by a continuous barrier of pools and beds of reeds:  towards the east the space reclaimed resembles a verdant promontory  thrust boldly out into an ocean of sand. The extent of the cultivated  area is limited on the west by the narrow strip of rock and clay which  forms the littoral. From the mouth of the Litany to that of the Orontes,  the coast presents a rugged, precipitous, and inhospitable appearance.  There are no ports, and merely a few ill-protected harbours, or narrow  beaches lying under formidable headlands. One river, the Nahr el-Kebir,  which elsewhere would not attract the traveller's attention, is here  noticeable as being the only stream whose waters flow constantly and  with tolerable regularity; the others, the Leon, the Adonis,* and the  Nahr el-Kelb,* can scarcely even be called torrents, being precipitated  as it were in one leap from the Lebanon to the Mediterranean. Olives,  vines, and corn cover the maritime plain, while in ancient times the  heights were clothed with impenetrable forests of oak, pine, larch,  cypress, spruce, and cedar. The mountain range drops in altitude towards  the centre of the country and becomes merely a line of low hills,  connecting Gebel Ansarieh with the Lebanon proper; beyond the latter  it continues without interruption, till at length, above the narrow  Phoenician coast road, it rises in the form of an almost insurmountable  wall. Near to the termination of Coele-Syria, but separated from it  by a range of hills, there opens out on the western slopes of Hermon a  valley unlike any other in the world. At this point the surface of the  earth has been rent in prehistoric times by volcanic action, leaving a  chasm which has never since closed up. A river, unique in character--the  Jordan--flows down this gigantic crevasse, fertilizing the valley formed  by it from end to end.***         * The Adonis of classical authors is now Nahr-Ibrahim. We       have as yet no direct evidence as to the Phoenician name of       this river; it was probably identical with that of the       divinity worshipped on its banks. The fact of a river       bearing the name of a god is not surprising: the Belos, in       the neighbourhood of Acre, affords us a parallel case to the       Adonis.         ** The present Nahr el-Kelb is the Lykos of classical       authors. The Due de Luynes thought he recognized a       corruption of the Phoenician name in that of Alcobile, which       is mentioned hereabouts in the Itinerary of the pilgrim of       Bordeaux. The order of the Itinerary does not favour this       identification, and Alcobile is probably Jebail: it is none       the less probable that the original name of the Nahr el Kelb       contained from earliest times the Phoenician equivalent of       the Arab word _kelb_, \"dog.\"         *** The Jordan is mentioned in the Egyptian texts under the       name of Yorduna: the name appears to mean _the descender,       the down-flowing._    Its principal source is at Tell el-Qadi, where it rises out of a  basaltic mound whose summit is crowned by the ruins of Laish.*         * This source is mentioned by Josephus as being that of the       Little Jordan.

The water collects in an oval rocky basin hidden by bushes, and flows  down among the brushwood to join the Nahr el-Hasbany, which brings the  waters of the upper torrents to swell its stream; a little lower down it  mingles with the Banias branch, and winds for some time amidst desolate  marshy meadows before disappearing in the thick beds of rushes bordering  Lake Huleh.*         * Lake Huleh is called the Waters of Merom, Me-Merom, in the       Book of Joshua, xi. 5, 7; and Lake Sammochonitis in       Josephus. The name of Ulatha, which was given to the       surrounding country, shows that the modern word Huleh is       derived from an ancient form, of which unfortunately the       original has not come down to us.    [Illustration 014b.jpg LAKE OF GENESARATH]    At this point the Jordan reaches the level of the Mediterranean, but  instead of maintaining it, the river makes a sudden drop on leaving the  lake, cutting for itself a deeply grooved channel. It has a fall of  some 300 feet before reaching the Lake of Grenesareth, where it is only  momentarily arrested, as if to gather fresh strength for its headlong  career southwards.

Chabas was inclined to read Utena, and Brugsch, Uthent, more       correctly Utanatiu, utanati, the people of Uatanit. The       juxtaposition of this name with that of the Libyans compels       us to look towards the west for the site of this people: may       we assign to them the Ionian Islands, or even those in the       western Mediterranean.    The poem became celebrated. When Seti I., two centuries later, commanded  the Poet Laureates of his court to celebrate his victories in verse,  the latter, despairing of producing anything better, borrowed the finest  strophes from this hymn to Thutmosis IIL, merely changing the name of  the hero. The composition, unlike so many other triumphal inscriptions,  is not a mere piece of official rhetoric, in which the poverty of the  subject is concealed by a multitude of common-places whether historical  or mythological. Egypt indeed ruled the world, either directly or  through her vassals, and from the mountains of Abyssinia to those  of Cilicia her armies held the nations in awe with the threat of the  Pharaoh.    The conqueror, as a rule, did not retain any part of their territory. He  confined himself to the appropriation of the revenue of certain domains  for the benefit of his gods.* Amon of Karnak thus became possessor of  seven Syrian towns which he owed to the generosity of the victorious  Pharaohs.**         * The seven towns which Amon possessed in Syria are       mentioned, in the time of Ramses III., in the list of the       domains and revenues of the god.         ** In the year XXIII., on his return from his first       campaign, Thutmosis III. provided offerings, guaranteed from       the three towns Anaugasa, Inuamu, and Hurnikaru, for his       father Amonra.    Certain cities, like Tunipa, even begged for statues of Thutmosis  for which they built a temple and instituted a cultus. Amon and his  fellow-gods too were adored there, side by side with the sovereign the  inhabitants had chosen to represent them here below.* These rites were  at once a sign of servitude, and a proof of gratitude for services  rendered, or privileges which had been confirmed. The princes of  neighbouring regions repaired annually to these temples to renew their  oaths of allegiance, and to bring their tributes \"before the face of the  king.\" Taking everything into account, the condition of the Pharaoh's  subjects might have been a pleasant one, had they been able to accept  their lot without any mental reservation. They retained their own laws,  their dynasties, and their frontiers, and paid a tax only in proportion  to their resources, while the hostages given were answerable for their  obedience. These hostages were as a rule taken by Thutmosis from among  the sons or the brothers of the enemy's chief. They were carried to  Thebes, where a suitable establishment was assigned to them,** the  younger members receiving an education which practically made them  Egyptians.         * The statues of Thutmosis III. and of the gods of Egypt       erected at Tunipa are mentioned in a letter from the       inhabitants of that town to Amenothes III. Later, Ramses       II., speaking of the two towns in the country of the Khati       in which were two statues of His Majesty, mentions Tunipa as       one of them.         ** The various titles of the lists of Thutmosis III. at       Thebes show us \"the children of the Syrian chiefs conducted       as prisoners\" into the town of Suhanu, which is elsewhere       mentioned as the depot, the prison of the temple of Anion.       W. Max Mullcr was the first to remark the historical value       of this indication, but without sufficiently insisting on       it; the name indicates, perhaps, as he says, a great prison,       but a prison like those where the princes of the family of       the Ottoman sultans were confined by the reigning monarch--       a palace usually provided with all the comforts of Oriental       life.    As soon as a vacancy occurred in the succession either in Syria or in  Ethiopia, the Pharaoh would choose from among the members of the family  whom he held in reserve, that prince on whose loyalty he could best  count, and placed him upon the throne.* The method of procedure was not  always successful, since these princes, whom one would have supposed  from their training to have been the least likely to have asserted  themselves against the man to whom they owed their elevation, often gave  more trouble than others. The sense of the supreme power of Egypt, which  had been inculcated in them during their exile, seemed to be weakened  after their return to their native country, and to give place to a  sense of their own importance. Their hearts misgave them as the time  approached for them to send their own children as pledges to their  suzerain, and also when called upon to transfer a considerable part of  their revenue to his treasury. They found, moreover, among their own  cities and kinsfolk, those who were adverse to the foreign yoke, and  secretly urged their countrymen to revolt, or else competitors for the  throne who took advantage of the popular discontent to pose as champions  of national independence, and it was difficult for the vassal prince to  counteract the intrigues of these adversaries without openly declaring  himself hostile to his foreign master.**         * Among the Tel el-Amarna tablets there is a letter of a       petty Syrian king, Adadnirari, whose father was enthroned       after a fashion in Nukhassi by Thutmosis III.         ** Thus, in the Tel el-Amarna correspondence, Zimrida,       governor of Sidon, gives information to Amenothes III. on       the intrigues which the notables of the town were concocting       against Egyptian authority. Ribaddu relates in one of these       despatches that the notables of Byblos and the women of his       harem were urging him to revolt; later, a letter of Amunira       to the King of Egypt informs us that Ribaddu had been driven       from Byblos by his own brother.    A time quickly came when a vestige of fear alone constrained them to  conceal their wish for liberty; the most trivial incident then sufficed  to give them the necessary encouragement, and decided them to throw  off the mask, a repulse or the report of a repulse suffered by the  Egyptians, the news of a popular rising in some neighbouring state, the  passing visit of a Chaldaean emissary who left behind him the hope  of support and perhaps of subsidies from Babylon, and the unexpected  arrival of a troop of mercenaries whose services might be hired for  the occasion.* A rising of this sort usually brought about the most  disastrous results. The native prince or the town itself could keep back  the tribute and own allegiance to no one during the few months required  to convince Pharaoh of their defection and to allow him to prepare the  necessary means of vengeance; the advent of the Egyptians followed, and  the work of repression was systematically set in hand. They destroyed  the harvests, whether green or ready for the sickle, they cut down the  palms and olive trees, they tore up the vines, seized on the flocks,  dismantled the strongholds, and took the inhabitants prisoners.**         * Burnaburiash, King of Babylon, speaks of Syrian agents who       had come to ask for support from his father, Kurigalzu, and       adds that the latter had counselled submission. In one of       the letters preserved in the British Museum, Aziru defends       himself for having received an emissary of the King of the       Khati.         ** Cf. the raiding, for instance, of the regions of Arvad       and of the Zahi by Thutmosis III., described in the Annals,       11. 4, 5.
