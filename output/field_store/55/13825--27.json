Grain was stored in pits in the earth. Each  hut had a garden for fruit and vegetables. A goat or cow might  be tied out of reach of the garden. There was a fence or hedge  surrounding and protecting the garden area and dwelling. Outside  the fence were an acre or two of fields of wheat and barley, and  sometimes oats and rye. Wheat and rye were sown in the fall, and  oats and barley in the spring. They were all harvested in the  summer. These fields were usually enclosed with a hedge to keep  animals from eating the crop. Flax was grown and made into linen  cloth. Beyond the fields were pastures for cattle and sheep  grazing. There was often an area for beehives.    Crops were produced with the open field system. In this system,  there were three large fields for the heavy and fertile land.  Each field was divided into long and narrow strips. Each strip  represented a day's work with the plough. One field had wheat,  or perhaps rye, another had barley, oats, beans, or peas, and  the third was fallow. These were rotated yearly. Each free man  was allotted certain strips in each field to bear crops. His  strips were far from each other, which insured some very fertile  and some only fair soil, and some land near his village dwelling  and some far away. These strips he cultivated, sowed with seed,  and harvested for himself and his family. After the year, they  reverted to common ownership for grazing.    The plough used was heavy and made first of wood and later of  iron. It had a mould-board which caught the soil stirred by the  plough blade and threw it into a ridge. Other farm implements  were: coulters, which gave free passage to the plough by cutting  weeds and turf, picks, spades and shovels, reaping hooks and  scythes, and sledge-hammers and anvils. With iron axes, forests  were cleared to provide more arable land.    The use of this open field system instead of compact enclosures  worked by individuals was necessary in primitive communities  which were farming only for their own subsistence. Each ox was  owned by a different man as was the plough. Strips of land for  agriculture were added from waste land as the community grew.    There were villages which had one or two market days in each  week. Cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, calves, and rabbits were  sold there.      Flint workers mined with deer antler picks and ox shoulder blade  shovels for flint to grind into axes, spearheads, and  arrowheads. People used bone and stone tools, such as stone  hammers, and then bronze and iron tools, weapons, breast plates,  and horse bits, which were formed from moulds and/or forged by  bronze smiths and blacksmiths. Weapons included bows and arrows,  flint and copper daggers, stone axes, and shields of wood with  bronze mountings. The warriors fought with chariots drawn by two  horses. The horse harnesses had bronze fittings. The chariots  had wood wheels, later with iron rims. When bronze came into  use, there was a demand for its constituent parts: copper and  tin, which were traded by rafts on waterways and the sea. Lead  was mined. Wrought iroin bars were used as currency.    Corpses were buried far away from any village in wood coffins,  except for Kings, who were placed in stone coffins after being  wrapped in linen. Possessions were buried with them.    With the ability to grow food and the acquisition of land by  conquest, for instance by invading Angles and Saxons, the  population grew. There were different classes of men such as  eorls, ceorls [free farmers], and slaves. They dressed  differently. Freemen had long hair and beards. Slaves' hair was  shorn from their heads so that they were bald. Slaves were  chained and often traded. Prisoners taken in battle, e.g.  Britons, became slaves. Criminals became slaves of the person  wronged or of the King. Sometimes a father pressed by need sold  his children or his wife into bondage. Debtors, who increased in  number during famine, which occurred regularly, became slaves by  giving up the freeman's sword and spear, picking up a slave's  mattock [pick ax for the soils], and placing their head within a  master's hands. Children with a slave parent were slaves. The  slaves lived in huts around the homes of big landholders, which  were made of logs and consisted on one large room or hall. An  open hearth was in the middle of the earthen floor, which was  strewn with rushes. There was a hole in the roof to let out the  smoke. Here the landholder and his men would eat meat, bread,  salt, hot spiced ale, and mead while listening to minstrels sing  about the heroic deeds of their ancestors. Physical strength and  endurance in adversity were admired traits. Slaves often were  used as grain-grinders, ploughmen, sowers, haywards, woodwards,  shepherds, goatherds, swineherds, oxherds, cowherds, dairymaids,  and barnmen. A lord could kill his slave at will.    The people were worshipping pagan gods when St. Augustine came to  England in 596 A.D. to Christianize them. King AEthelbert of  Kent and his wife, who had been raised Christian on the  continent, met him when he arrived. The King gave him land where  there were ruins of an old city. Augustine used stones from the  ruins to build a church which was later called Canterbury. He  also built the first St. Paul's church in what was later called  London. Aethelbert and his men who fought with him and ate in  his household [gesiths] became Christian.    Augustine knew how to write, but King AEthelbert did not. The  King announced his laws at meetings of his people and his eorls  would decide the punishments. There was a fine of 120s. for  disregarding a command of the King. He and Augustine decided to  write down some of these laws, which now included the King's new  law concerning the church.    These laws concern personal injury, murder, theft, burglary,  marriage, adultery, and inheritance. The blood feud's private  revenge for killing had been replaced by payment of compensation  to the dead man's kindred. One paid a man's \"wergeld\" [worth] to  his kindred for causing his wrongful death. The wergeld [wer] of  an aetheling was 1500s., of an eorl, 300s., of a ceorl, 100s.,  of a laet [agricultural serf in Kent], 40-80s., and of a slave  nothing. At this time a shilling could buy a cow in Kent or a  sheep elsewhere. If a ceorl killed an eorl, he paid three times  as much as an eorl would have paid as murderer. The penalty for  slander was tearing out of the tongue. If an aetheling were  guilty of this offense, his tongue was worth five times that of  a coerl, so he had to pay proportionately more to ransom it.      The Law    \"THESE ARE THE DOOMS [DECREES] WHICH KING AETHELBERHT ESTABLISHED  IN THE DAYS OF AUGUSTINE    1. [Theft of] the property of God and of the church [shall be  compensated], twelve-fold; a bishop's property, eleven-fold; a  priest's property, nine-fold; a deacon's property, six-fold; a  cleric's property, three-fold; church-frith [breach of the peace  of the church; right of sanctuary and protection given to those  within its precincts], two-fold [that of ordinary breach of the  peace]; m....frith [breach of the peace of a meeting place],  two-fold.    2.

If I describe Thee, O my God, as Him Who is the All-Perceiving, I find  myself compelled to admit that They Who are the highest Embodiments of  perception have been created by virtue of Thy behest. And if I extol Thee  as Him Who is the All-Wise, I, likewise, am forced to recognize that the  Well Springs of wisdom have themselves been generated through the  operation of Thy Will. And if I proclaim Thee as the Incomparable One, I  soon discover that they Who are the inmost essence of oneness have been  sent down by Thee and are but the evidences of Thine handiwork. And if I  acclaim Thee as the Knower of all things, I must confess that they Who are  the Quintessence of knowledge are but the creation and instruments of Thy  Purpose.    Exalted, immeasurably exalted, art Thou above the strivings of mortal man  to unravel Thy mystery, to describe Thy glory, or even to hint at the  nature of Thine Essence. For whatever such strivings may accomplish, they  never can hope to transcend the limitations imposed upon Thy creatures,  inasmuch as these efforts are actuated by Thy decree, and are begotten of  Thine invention. The loftiest sentiments which the holiest of saints can  express in praise of Thee, and the deepest wisdom which the most learned  of men can utter in their attempts to comprehend Thy nature, all revolve  around that Center Which is wholly subjected to Thy sovereignty, Which  adoreth Thy Beauty, and is propelled through the movement of Thy Pen.    Nay, forbid it, O my God, that I should have uttered such words as must of  necessity imply the existence of any direct relationship between the Pen  of Thy Revelation and the essence of all created things. Far, far are They  Who are related to Thee above the conception of such relationship! All  comparisons and likenesses fail to do justice to the Tree of Thy  Revelation, and every way is barred to the comprehension of the  Manifestation of Thy Self and the Day Spring of Thy Beauty.    Far, far from Thy glory be what mortal man can affirm of Thee, or  attribute unto Thee, or the praise with which he can glorify Thee!  Whatever duty Thou hast prescribed unto Thy servants of extolling to the  utmost Thy majesty and glory is but a token of Thy grace unto them, that  they may be enabled to ascend unto the station conferred upon their own  inmost being, the station of the knowledge of their own selves.    No one else besides Thee hath, at any time, been able to fathom Thy  mystery, or befittingly to extol Thy greatness. Unsearchable and high  above the praise of men wilt Thou remain for ever. There is none other God  but Thee, the Inaccessible, the Omnipotent, the Omniscient, the Holy of  Holies.            II: THE BEGINNING OF ALL THINGS IS THE KNOWLEDGE...      The beginning of all things is the knowledge of God, and the end of all  things is strict observance of whatsoever hath been sent down from the  empyrean of the Divine Will that pervadeth all that is in the heavens and  all that is on the earth.            III: THE REVELATION WHICH, FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL,...      The Revelation which, from time immemorial, hath been acclaimed as the  Purpose and Promise of all the Prophets of God, and the most cherished  Desire of His Messengers, hath now, by virtue of the pervasive Will of the  Almighty and at His irresistible bidding, been revealed unto men. The  advent of such a Revelation hath been heralded in all the sacred  Scriptures. Behold how, notwithstanding such an announcement, mankind hath  strayed from its path and shut out itself from its glory.    Say: O ye lovers of the One true God! Strive, that ye may truly recognize  and know Him, and observe befittingly His precepts. This is a Revelation,  under which, if a man shed for its sake one drop of blood, myriads of  oceans will be his recompense. Take heed, O friends, that ye forfeit not  so inestimable a benefit, or disregard its transcendent station. Consider  the multitude of lives that have been, and are still being, sacrificed in  a world deluded by a mere phantom which the vain imaginations of its  peoples have conceived. Render thanks unto God, inasmuch as ye have  attained unto your heart's Desire, and been united to Him Who is the  Promise of all nations. Guard ye, with the aid of the one true God--exalted  be His glory--the integrity of the station which ye have attained, and  cleave to that which shall promote His Cause. He, verily, enjoineth on you  what is right and conducive to the exaltation of man's station. Glorified  be the All-Merciful, the Revealer of this wondrous Tablet.            IV: THIS IS THE DAY IN WHICH GOD'S MOST EXCELLENT...      This is the Day in which God's most excellent favors have been poured out  upon men, the Day in which His most mighty grace hath been infused into  all created things. It is incumbent upon all the peoples of the world to  reconcile their differences, and, with perfect unity and peace, abide  beneath the shadow of the Tree of His care and loving-kindness. It  behoveth them to cleave to whatsoever will, in this Day, be conducive to  the exaltation of their stations, and to the promotion of their best  interests. Happy are those whom the all-glorious Pen was moved to  remember, and blessed are those men whose names, by virtue of Our  inscrutable decree, We have preferred to conceal.    Beseech ye the one true God to grant that all men may be graciously  assisted to fulfil that which is acceptable in Our sight. Soon will the  present-day order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead.  Verily, thy Lord speaketh the truth, and is the Knower of things unseen.            V: THIS IS THE DAY WHEREON THE OCEAN OF GOD'S...      This is the Day whereon the Ocean of God's mercy hath been manifested unto  men, the Day in which the Day Star of His loving-kindness hath shed its  radiance upon them, the Day in which the clouds of His bountiful favor  have overshadowed the whole of mankind. Now is the time to cheer and  refresh the down-cast through the invigorating breeze of love and  fellowship, and the living waters of friendliness and charity.    They who are the beloved of God, in whatever place they gather and  whomsoever they may meet, must evince, in their attitude towards God, and  in the manner of their celebration of His praise and glory, such humility  and submissiveness that every atom of the dust beneath their feet may  attest the depth of their devotion. The conversation carried by these holy  souls should be informed with such power that these same atoms of dust  will be thrilled by its influence. They should conduct themselves in such  manner that the earth upon which they tread may never be allowed to  address to them such words as these: \"I am to be preferred above you. For  witness, how patient I am in bearing the burden which the husbandman  layeth upon me. I am the instrument that continually imparteth unto all  beings the blessings with which He Who is the Source of all grace hath  entrusted me. Notwithstanding the honor conferred upon me, and the  unnumbered evidences of my wealth--a wealth that supplieth the needs of all  creation--behold the measure of my humility, witness with what absolute  submissiveness I allow myself to be trodden beneath the feet of men....\"    Show forbearance and benevolence and love to one another. Should any one  among you be incapable of grasping a certain truth, or be striving to  comprehend it, show forth, when conversing with him, a spirit of extreme  kindliness and good-will. Help him to see and recognize the truth, without  esteeming yourself to be, in the least, superior to him, or to be  possessed of greater endowments.    The whole duty of man in this Day is to attain that share of the flood of  grace which God poureth forth for him. Let none, therefore, consider the  largeness or smallness of the receptacle. The portion of some might lie in  the palm of a man's hand, the portion of others might fill a cup, and of  others even a gallon-measure.    Every eye, in this Day, should seek what will best promote the Cause of  God. He, Who is the Eternal Truth, beareth Me witness! Nothing whatever  can, in this Day, inflict a greater harm upon this Cause than dissension  and strife, contention, estrangement and apathy, among the loved ones of  God. Flee them, through the power of God and His sovereign aid, and strive  ye to knit together the hearts of men, in His Name, the Unifier, the  All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    Beseech ye the one true God to grant that ye may taste the savor of such  deeds as are performed in His path, and partake of the sweetness of such  humility and submissiveness as are shown for His sake. Forget your own  selves, and turn your eyes towards your neighbor. Bend your energies to  whatever may foster the education of men. Nothing is, or can ever be,  hidden from God. If ye follow in His way, His incalculable and  imperishable blessings will be showered upon you. This is the luminous  Tablet, whose verses have streamed from the moving Pen of Him Who is the  Lord of all worlds. Ponder it in your hearts, and be ye of them that  observe its precepts.            VI: BEHOLD, HOW THE DIVERS PEOPLES AND KINDREDS...      Behold, how the divers peoples and kindreds of the earth have been waiting  for the coming of the Promised One. No sooner had He, Who is the Sun of  Truth, been made manifest, than, lo, all turned away from Him, except them  whom God was pleased to guide. We dare not, in this Day, lift the veil  that concealeth the exalted station which every true believer can attain,  for the joy which such a revelation must provoke might well cause a few to  faint away and die.    He Who is the Heart and Center of the Bayan hath written: \"The germ that  holdeth within itself the potentialities of the "]]]
