It is very  interesting and fascinating and, in the hands of a skilled instructor,  is readily correlated with other work.    Wood turning gives a pupil preliminary experience necessary in pattern  making and machine shop work. It brings into play the scientific element  by demonstrating the laws governing revolving bodies. In bringing the  chisel into contact with the revolving surface, the mathematical  principle of the \"point of tangency\" is illustrated. Excellent tool  technique is developed in wood turning as on the exactness of every  movement depends the success of the operator, and any slight variation  will spoil a piece of work. This brings in a very close correlation of  the mental and motor activities and also gives the student an  opportunity for observing and thinking while at work. When his tool  makes a \"run\" he must determine the reason and figure out why a certain  result is obtained when the chisel is held in a given position. Certain  cuts must be fully mastered, and it takes a good deal of experience and  absolute confidence in one's self in manipulating the tools before it is  possible to attempt skilful work. If scraping is allowed the educational  value of the work is lost.    In wood turning a vast field for design and modeling is opened, and art  and architecture can be correlated. The pupil will see for himself the  need of variety in curves and must use his judgment in determining  curves that are so harmonious and pleasing that they will blend  together. If properly taught the beauty in the orders of architecture  can be brought out in the making of the bead, fillet, scotia, cove, etc.    A feeling of importance is excited in a boy when he sees his hands  shaping materials into objects of pleasing form. Wood turning properly  taught awakens the aesthetic sense and creates a desire for the  beautiful. The boy or man who has learned to make graceful curves and  clean-cut fillets and beads will never be satisfied with clumsy effects  which are characteristic in cheap commercial work, made only to sell.    Success in turning depends on the following:      1. Care of lathe, tools, selection of materials.    2. Study of the scientific elements of--          a. Revolving bodies.          b. Points of tangency.          c. Study of results by reasoning and observing.    3. Development of technique and exactness.    4. Correlation of mental and motor activities.          CHAPTER II    THE LATHE      The sizes of turning lathes are given as 10\", 12\", etc. These figures  denote the diameter, or size, of the largest piece of work that can be  turned on them. The measurement is taken from the center point of the  live center to the bed of the lathe (usually 5\" or 6\") and is one-half  the diameter of the entire circle. The length of a lathe is determined  by the length of a piece of work that can be turned. This measurement is  taken from the points of the live and dead centers when the tail stock  is drawn back the full extent of the lathe bed. Fig. 1 shows a turning  lathe with sixteen principal parts named. The student should learn the  names of these parts and familiarize himself with the particular  function of each.      CARE OF THE LATHE    The lathe should be oiled every day before starting. At the end of the  period the lathe should be brushed clean of all chips and shavings,  after which it should be rubbed off with a piece of waste or cloth to  remove all surplus oil. All tools should be wiped clean and put in their  proper places. If a student finds that his lathe is not running as it  should, he should first call the attention of the instructor to that  fact before attempting to adjust it; and then only such adjustments  should be made as the instructor directs.      SPEED OF THE LATHE    The speed of the lathe should range from 2400 to 3000 revolutions per  minute when the belt is on the smallest step of the cone pulley. At this  speed stock up to 3\" in diameter can be turned with safety. Stock from  3\" to 6\" in diameter should be turned on the second or third step, and  all stock over 6\" on the last step. The speed at which a lathe should  run depends entirely upon the nature of the work to be done and the kind  of material used. Pieces that cannot be centered accurately and all  glued-up work with rough corners should be run slowly until all corners  are taken off and the stock runs true. At high speed the centrificial  force on such pieces is very great, causing the lathe to vibrate, and  there is a possibility of the piece being thrown from the lathe thus  endangering the worker as well as those around him. After the stock is  running true the speed may be increased.    [Illustration: Fig. 1. - Wood Turning Lathe]    TO FIGURE THE DIAMETER OF PULLEYS    Suppose a motor runs 1500 R.P.M. and is fitted with a 4\" pulley. Suppose  also, a main shaft should run 300 R.P.M.      Then, 1500 : 300 :: x : 4;      Or, 300x = 6000,        x = 20, or the diameter of the large pulley on the main shaft.      Suppose again that a line shaft runs 300 R.P.M., and a counter shaft 600  R.P.M. The counter shaft has a pulley 4\" in diameter. The pulley on the  line shaft must then have a diameter of 8\".        300 : 600 :: 4 : x;      Or, 300x = 2400,        x = 8\"    Suppose the cone pulley on the counter shaft runs 600 R.P.M.; a lathe  spindle runs 2200 R.P.M., when connected with the small cone pulley  which has a diameter of 3\". The large cone pulley has then a diameter of  11\".      600 : 2200 :: 3 : x      Or, 600x = 6600;        x = 11\"      RULES FOR FINDING THE SPEEDS AND SIZES OF PULLEYS    1. To find the diameter of the driving pulley:    Multiply the diameter of the driven by the number of revolutions it  should make and divide the product by the number of revolutions of the  driver. (20 x 300 = 6000; 6000 / 1500 = 4\"--diameter of motor pulley.)    2. To find the diameter of the driven pulley:    Multiply the diameter of the driver by its number of revolutions and  divide the product by the number of revolutions of the driven. (4 x 1500  = 6000; 6000 / 300 = 20\"--diameter of the driven pulley.)    3. To find the number of revolutions of the driven pulley:    Multiply the diameter of the driver by its number of revolutions and  divide by the diameter of the driven. (4 x 1500 = 6000; 6000 / 20 =  300--revolutions of driven pulley.)      POINTS ON SETTING UP LATHE AND SHAFTING    The counter shaft should be about 7' above the lathe. A distance of 6'  from the center of the shaft to the center of the spindle is sufficient.  In setting a lathe or hanging a counter shaft it is necessary that both  be level. The counter shaft must be parallel to the line shaft. When the  counter shaft is in position a plumb bob should be hung from the counter  shaft cone to the spindle cone; the lathe should be adjusted so that the  belt will track between the two cone pulleys. The axis of the lathe must  be parallel to that of the counter shaft. The lathe, however, need not  be directly beneath the counter shaft as the belt will run on an angle  as well as perpendicular.          CHAPTER III    WOOD TURNING TOOLS      A wood turning kit should consist of one each of the following tools.  Fig. 2 shows the general shape of these tools.         1-1/4\" Gouge       3/4\" Gouge       1/2\" Gouge       1/4\" Gouge     1-1/4\" Skew       3/4\" Skew       1/2\" Skew       1/4\" Skew       1/8\" Parting Tool       1/2\" Round Nose       1/4\" Round Nose       1/2\" Square Nose       1/4\" Square Nose       1/2\" Spear Point       1/2\" Right Skew       1/2\" Left Skew            Slip Stone with round edges         6\" Outside Calipers         6\" Inside Calipers         8\" Dividers        12\" Rule    1/2 pt. Oil Can            Bench Brush      GRINDING AND WHETTING TURNING TOOLS    Skew Chisel    The skew chisel is sharpened equally on both sides On this tool the  cutting edge should form an angle of about 20 deg. with one of the edges.  The skew is used in cutting both to the right and to the left, and  therefore, must be beveled on both sides. The length of the bevel should  equal about twice the thickness of the chisel at the point where it is  sharpened. In grinding the bevel, the chisel must be held so that the  cutting edge will be parallel to the axis of the emery wheel. The wheel  should be about 6\" in diameter as this will leave the bevel slightly  hollow ground. Cool the chisel in water occasionally when using a dry  emery. Otherwise the wheel will burn the chisel, taking out the temper;  the metal will be soft and the edge will not stand up. Care should be  exercised that the same bevel is kept so that it will be uniformly  hollow ground. The rough edge left by the emery wheel should be whetted  off with a slip stone by holding the chisel on the flat side of the  stone so that the toe and heel of the bevel are equally in contact with  it. Rub first on one side and then on the other. The wire edge is thus  worn off quickly as there is no metal to be worn away in the middle of  the bevels. The chisel is sharp when the edge, which may be tested by  drawing it over the thumb nail, is smooth and will take hold evenly  along its entire length. If any wire edge remains it should be whetted  again.    [Illustration: Fig. 2. - Lathe Tools]      Gouge    The gouge used in wood turning is beveled on the outside and is ground  so that the nose is approximately semi-circular in shape. The tool is a  combination of the round nose chisel and the ordinary gouge. The bevel  should extend well around to the ends so that the cutting edge extends  to each side. This is necessary to avoid the abrupt corners which would  be present if the nose were left straight across as in the ordinary  wood-working gouge. In making shearing cuts the round nose permits the  tool to be rolled to the side to avoid scraping the work. The length of  the bevel should be about twice the thickness of the blade at the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15464"],[0,"Foods That Will Win the War and How to Cook Them (1918) (#2)"],[1,"nge, gas, or electric oven for the baking of poor bread is an actual  national loss. There must be no waste in poor baking or from poor care  after the bread is made, or from the waste of a crust or crumb.    Waste in your kitchen means starvation in some other kitchen across  the sea. Our Allies are asking for 450,000,000 bushels of wheat,  and we are told that even then theirs will be a privation loaf. Crop  shortage and unusual demand has left Canada and the United States,  which are the largest sources of wheat, with but 300,000,000 bushels  available for export. The deficit must be met by reducing consumption  on this side the Atlantic. This can be done by eliminating waste and  by making use of cereals and flours other than wheat in bread-making.    The wide use of wheat flour for bread-making has been due to custom.  In Europe rye and oats form the staple breads of many countries, and  in some sections of the South corn-bread is the staff of life. We have  only to modify a little our bread-eating habits in order to meet the  present need. Other cereals can well be used to eke out the wheat, but  they require slightly different handling.    In making yeast breads, the essential ingredient is gluten, which  is extended by carbon dioxide gas formed by yeast growth. With the  exception of rye, grains other than wheat do not contain sufficient  gluten for yeast bread, and it is necessary to use a wheat in varying  proportions in order to supply the deficient gluten. Even the baker's  rye loaf is usually made of one-half rye and one-half wheat. This is  the safest proportion for home use in order to secure a good texture.    When oatmeal is used, it is necessary to scald the oatmeal to prevent  a raw taste. Oatmeal also makes a softer dough than wheat, and it  is best to make the loaf smaller and bake it longer: about one hour  instead of the forty-five minutes which we allow for wheat bread.    The addition of one-third barley flour to wheat flour makes a light  colored, good flavored bread. If a larger proportion than this is  used, the loaf has a decided barley flavor. If you like this flavor  and increase the proportion of barley, be sure to allow the dough a  little longer time to rise, as by increasing the barley you weaken the  gluten content of your loaf.    Rice and cornmeal can be added to wheat breads in a 10 per cent.  proportion. Laboratory tests have shown that any greater proportion  than this produces a heavy, small loaf.    Potato flour or mashed potato can be used to extend the wheat, it  being possible to work in almost 50 per cent. of potato, but this  makes a darker and moister loaf than when wheat alone is used. In  order to take care of this moisture, it is best to reserve part of  the wheat for the second kneading.    Graham and entire wheat flour also effect a saving of wheat because  a larger percentage of the wheat berry is used. Graham flour is  the whole kernel of wheat, ground. Entire wheat flour is the flour  resulting from the grinding of all but the outer layer of wheat. A  larger use of these coarser flours will therefore help materially  in eking out our scant wheat supply as the percentage of the wheat  berry used for bread flour is but 72 per cent. Breads made from these  coarser flours also aid digestion and are a valuable addition to the  dietary.    In order to keep down waste by eliminating the poor batch of bread,  it is necessary to understand the principles of bread-making.  Fermentation is the basic principle of yeast bread, and fermentation  is controlled by temperature. The yeast plant grows at a temperature  from 70 to 90 degrees (Fahrenheit), and if care is taken to maintain  this temperature during the process of fermentation, waste caused by  sour dough or over-fermentation will be eliminated. When we control  the temperature we can also reduce the time necessary for making a  loaf of bread, or several loaves of bread as may be needed, into as  short a period as three hours. This is what is known as the quick  method. It not only saves time and labor, but, controlling the  temperature, insures accurate results. The easiest way to control the  temperature is to put the bowl containing the dough into another of  slightly larger size containing water at a temperature of 90 degrees.  The water of course should never be hot. Hot water kills the yeast  plant. Cold water checks its growth. Cover the bowl and set it in the  gas oven or fireless cooker or on the shelf of the coal range. As the  water in the large bowl cools off, remove a cupful and add a cupful of  hot water. At the end of one and one-half hours the dough should have  doubled in bulk. Take it out of the pan and knead until the large gas  bubbles are broken (about ten minutes). Then place in greased bread  pans and allow to rise for another half hour. At the end of this time  it will not only fill the pan, but will project out of it. Do not  allow the dough to rise too high, for then the bread will have large  holes in it. A good proportion as a general rule to follow, is:      3-1/2 cupfuls of flour (this includes added cereals)    1 cupful of water or milk    1/2 tablespoon shortening    1-1/2 teaspoons salt    1 cake of compressed yeast        In this recipe sugar has been omitted because of the serious      shortage, but after the war a teaspoon of sugar should be      added. The shortening, although small in quantity, may also be      omitted.    These materials make a loaf of about one pound, which should be  baked in forty to fifty minutes at a temperature of 450 degrees  (Fahrenheit). Allow a little longer time for bread containing oatmeal  or other grains. Such breads require a little longer baking and  a little lower temperature than wheat breads. If you do not use a  thermometer in testing your oven, place a piece of paper on the center  shelf, and if it browns in two minutes your oven is right. If a longer  period for raising is allowed than is suggested in the above recipe,  the yeast proportion should be decreased. For overnight bread use  one-quarter yeast cake per loaf; for six-hour bread, use one-half  yeast cake per loaf; for three-hour bread, use one yeast cake per  loaf. In baking, the time allowed should depend on the size of the  loaf. When baked at a temperature of 450 degrees, large loaves take  from forty-five to sixty minutes, small loaves from thirty to forty  minutes, rolls from ten to twenty minutes.    It is well to divide the oven time into four parts. During the first  quarter, the rising continues; second quarter, browning begins; the  third quarter, browning is finished; the fourth quarter, bread shrinks  from the side of the pan. These are always safe tests to follow in  your baking. When baked, the bread should be turned out of the pans  and allow to cool on a wire rack. When cool, put the bread in a stone  crock or bread box. To prevent staleness, keep the old bread away from  the fresh--scald the bread crock or give your bread box a sun bath at  frequent intervals.    Even with all possible care to prevent waste, yeast breads will not  conserve our wheat supply so well as quick breads, because all yeast  breads need a larger percentage of wheat. The home baker can better  serve her country by introducing into her menus numerous quick  breads that can be made from cornmeal, rye, corn and rye, hominy, and  buckwheat. Griddle cakes and waffles can also be made from lentils,  soy beans, potatoes, rice and peas.    Do not expect that the use of other cereals in bread-making will  reduce the cost of your bread. That is not the object. Saving of wheat  for war needs is the thing we are striving for, and this is as much  an act of loyalty as buying Liberty Bonds. It is to meet the crucial  world need of bread that we are learning to substitute, and not to  spare the national purse.    Besides this saving of wheat, our Government also asks us to omit  all fat from our yeast breads in order to conserve the diminishing  fat supply. This may seem impossible to the woman who has never made  bread without shortening, but recent experiments in bread-making  laboratories have proved that bread, without shortening, is just  as light and as good in texture as that made with shortening--the  only difference being a slight change in flavor. These experiments  have also shown that it is possible to supply shortening by the  introduction of 3 per cent. to 5 per cent. of canned cocoanut or of  peanut butter, and that sugar may also be omitted from bread-making  recipes. In fact, the war is bringing about manifold interesting  experiments which prove that edible and nutritious bread can be made  of many things besides the usual white flour.    The recipes herewith appended, showing the use of combinations of  cereals and wheat, have been carefully tested in The Forecast School  of Modern Cookery. Good bread can be made from each recipe, and the  new flavors obtained by the use of other grains make a pleasing and  wholesome variety.    A family which has eaten oatmeal or entire wheat bread will never  again be satisfied with a diet that includes only bread made from  bleached flour. Children, especially, will be benefited by the change,  as the breads made from coarser flours are not only more nutritious,  but are rich in the minerals and vitamine elements that are so  essential to the growth of strong teeth, bones and growing tissues.    The homemaker, too, will never regret her larger acquaintance with  bread-making materials, as the greater variety of breads that she will  find herself able to produce will be a source of pleasure and keen  satisfaction.
