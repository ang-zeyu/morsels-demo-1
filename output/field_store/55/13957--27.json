I  made a few unimportant alterations and additions, and added a Preface, of  which I cannot say that I am particularly proud, but an inexperienced  writer with a head somewhat turned by unexpected success is not to be  trusted with a preface.  I made a few further very trifling alterations  before moulds were taken, but since the summer of 1872, as new editions  were from time to time wanted, they have been printed from stereos then  made.    Having now, I fear, at too great length done what I was asked to do, I  should like to add a few words on my own account.  I am still fairly well  satisfied with those parts of \"Erewhon\" that were repeatedly rewritten,  but from those that had only a single writing I would gladly cut out some  forty or fifty pages if I could.    This, however, may not be, for the copyright will probably expire in a  little over twelve years.  It was necessary, therefore, to revise the  book throughout for literary inelegancies--of which I found many more  than I had expected--and also to make such substantial additions as  should secure a new lease of life--at any rate for the copyright.  If,  then, instead of cutting out, say fifty pages, I have been compelled to  add about sixty invita Minerva--the blame rests neither with my publisher  nor with me, but with the copyright laws.  Nevertheless I can assure the  reader that, though I have found it an irksome task to take up work which  I thought I had got rid of thirty years ago, and much of which I am  ashamed of, I have done my best to make the new matter savour so much of  the better portions of the old, that none but the best critics shall  perceive at what places the gaps of between thirty and forty years occur.    Lastly, if my readers note a considerable difference between the literary  technique of \"Erewhon\" and that of \"Erewhon Revisited,\" I would remind  them that, as I have just shown, \"Erewhon\" look something like ten years  in writing, and even so was written with great difficulty, while \"Erewhon  Revisited\" was written easily between November 1900 and the end of April  1901.  There is no central idea underlying \"Erewhon,\" whereas the attempt  to realise the effect of a single supposed great miracle dominates the  whole of its successor.  In \"Erewhon\" there was hardly any story, and  little attempt to give life and individuality to the characters; I hope  that in \"Erewhon Revisited\" both these defects have been in great measure  avoided.  \"Erewhon\" was not an organic whole, \"Erewhon Revisited\" may  fairly claim to be one.  Nevertheless, though in literary workmanship I  do not doubt that this last-named book is an improvement on the first, I  shall be agreeably surprised if I am not told that \"Erewhon,\" with all  its faults, is the better reading of the two.    SAMUEL BUTLER.  August 7, 1901          CHAPTER I: WASTE LANDS      If the reader will excuse me, I will say nothing of my antecedents, nor  of the circumstances which led me to leave my native country; the  narrative would be tedious to him and painful to myself.  Suffice it,  that when I left home it was with the intention of going to some new  colony, and either finding, or even perhaps purchasing, waste crown land  suitable for cattle or sheep farming, by which means I thought that I  could better my fortunes more rapidly than in England.    It will be seen that I did not succeed in my design, and that however  much I may have met with that was new and strange, I have been unable to  reap any pecuniary advantage.    It is true, I imagine myself to have made a discovery which, if I can be  the first to profit by it, will bring me a recompense beyond all money  computation, and secure me a position such as has not been attained by  more than some fifteen or sixteen persons, since the creation of the  universe.  But to this end I must possess myself of a considerable sum of  money: neither do I know how to get it, except by interesting the public  in my story, and inducing the charitable to come forward and assist me.  With this hope I now publish my adventures; but I do so with great  reluctance, for I fear that my story will be doubted unless I tell the  whole of it; and yet I dare not do so, lest others with more means than  mine should get the start of me.  I prefer the risk of being doubted to  that of being anticipated, and have therefore concealed my destination on  leaving England, as also the point from which I began my more serious and  difficult journey.    My chief consolation lies in the fact that truth bears its own impress,  and that my story will carry conviction by reason of the internal  evidences for its accuracy.  No one who is himself honest will doubt my  being so.    I reached my destination in one of the last months of 1868, but I dare  not mention the season, lest the reader should gather in which hemisphere  I was.  The colony was one which had not been opened up even to the most  adventurous settlers for more than eight or nine years, having been  previously uninhabited, save by a few tribes of savages who frequented  the seaboard.  The part known to Europeans consisted of a coast-line  about eight hundred miles in length (affording three or four good  harbours), and a tract of country extending inland for a space varying  from two to three hundred miles, until it a reached the offshoots of an  exceedingly lofty range of mountains, which could be seen from far out  upon the plains, and were covered with perpetual snow.  The coast was  perfectly well known both north and south of the tract to which I have  alluded, but in neither direction was there a single harbour for five  hundred miles, and the mountains, which descended almost into the sea,  were covered with thick timber, so that none would think of settling.    With this bay of land, however, the case was different.  The harbours  were sufficient; the country was timbered, but not too heavily; it was  admirably suited for agriculture; it also contained millions on millions  of acres of the most beautifully grassed country in the world, and of the  best suited for all manner of sheep and cattle.  The climate was  temperate, and very healthy; there were no wild animals, nor were the  natives dangerous, being few in number and of an intelligent tractable  disposition.    It may be readily understood that when once Europeans set foot upon this  territory they were not slow to take advantage of its capabilities.  Sheep  and cattle were introduced, and bred with extreme rapidity; men took up  their 50,000 or 100,000 acres of country, going inland one behind the  other, till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the  front ranges which was not taken up, and stations either for sheep or  cattle were spotted about at intervals of some twenty or thirty miles  over the whole country.  The front ranges stopped the tide of squatters  for some little time; it was thought that there was too much snow upon  them for too many months in the year,--that the sheep would get lost, the  ground being too difficult for shepherding,--that the expense of getting  wool down to the ship's side would eat up the farmer's profits,--and that  the grass was too rough and sour for sheep to thrive upon; but one after  another determined to try the experiment, and it was wonderful how  successfully it turned out.  Men pushed farther and farther into the  mountains, and found a very considerable tract inside the front range,  between it and another which was loftier still, though even this was not  the highest, the great snowy one which could be seen from out upon the  plains.  This second range, however, seemed to mark the extreme limits of  pastoral country; and it was here, at a small and newly founded station,  that I was received as a cadet, and soon regularly employed.  I was then  just twenty-two years old.    I was delighted with the country and the manner of life.  It was my daily  business to go up to the top of a certain high mountain, and down one of  its spurs on to the flat, in order to make sure that no sheep had crossed  their boundaries.  I was to see the sheep, not necessarily close at hand,  nor to get them in a single mob, but to see enough of them here and there  to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong; this was no difficult matter,  for there were not above eight hundred of them; and, being all breeding  ewes, they were pretty quiet.    There were a good many sheep which I knew, as two or three black ewes,  and a black lamb or two, and several others which had some distinguishing  mark whereby I could tell them.  I would try and see all these, and if  they were all there, and the mob looked large enough, I might rest  assured that all was well.  It is surprising how soon the eye becomes  accustomed to missing twenty sheep out of two or three hundred.  I had a  telescope and a dog, and would take bread and meat and tobacco with me.  Starting with early dawn, it would be night before I could complete my  round; for the mountain over which I had to go was very high.  In winter  it was covered with snow, and the sheep needed no watching from above.  If  I were to see sheep dung or tracks going down on to the other side of the  mountain (where there was a valley with a stream--a mere _cul de sac_), I  was to follow them, and look out for sheep; but I never saw any, the  sheep always descending on to their own side, partly from habit, and  partly because there was abundance of good sweet feed, which had been  burnt in the early spring, just before I came, and was now deliciously  green and rich, while that on the other side had never been burnt, and  was rank and coarse.    It was a monotonous life, but it was very healthy and one does not much  mind anything when one is well.  The country was the grandest that can be  imagined.  How often have I sat on the mountain side and watched the  waving downs, with the two white specks of huts in the distance, and the  little square"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19061"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 8 (#2)"],[1,"of great size  notwithstanding, and extremely high. They are very dirty; quite  undrained, if my nose be at all reliable; and emit a peculiar fragrance,  like the smell of very bad cheese, kept in very hot blankets.  Notwithstanding the height of the houses, there would seem to have been  a lack of room in the city, for new houses are thrust in everywhere.  Wherever it has been possible to cram a tumble-down tenement into a  crack or corner, in it has gone. If there be a nook or angle in the wall  of a church, or a crevice in any other dead wall, of any sort, there you  are sure to find some kind of habitation; looking as if it had grown  there, like a fungus. Against the Government House, against the old  Senate House, round about any large building, little shops stick close,  like parasite vermin to the great carcass. And for all this, look where  you may; up steps, down steps, anywhere, everywhere; there are irregular  houses, receding, starting forward, tumbling down, leaning against their  neighbors, crippling themselves or their friends by some means or other,  until one, more irregular than the rest, chokes up the way, and you  can't see any further.          MILAN CATHEDRAL[2]    BY HIPPOLYTE ADOLPHE TAINE      The cathedral, at the first sight, is bewildering. Gothic art,  transported entire into Italy at the close of the Middle Ages,[3]  attains at once its triumph and its extravagance. Never had it been seen  so pointed, so highly embroidered, so complex, so overcharged, so  strongly resembling a piece of jewelry; and as, instead of coarse and  lifeless stone, it here takes for its material the beautiful lustrous  Italian marble, it becomes a pure chased gem as precious through its  substance as through the labor bestowed on it. The whole church seems to  be a colossal and magnificent crystallization, so splendidly do its  forests of spires, its intersections of moldings, its population of  statues, its fringes of fretted, hollowed, embroidered and open  marblework, ascend in multiple and interminable bright forms against the  pure blue sky.    Truly is it the mystic candelabra of visions and legends, with a hundred  thousand branches bristling and overflowing with sorrowing thorns and  ecstatic roses, with angels, virgins, and martyrs upon every flower and  on every thorn, with infinite myriads of the triumphant Church springing  from the ground pyramidically even into the azure, with its millions of  blended and vibrating voices mounting upward in a single shout,  hosannah!...    We enter, and the impression deepens. What a difference between the  religious power of such a church and that of St. Peter's at Rome! One  exclaims to himself, this is the true Christian temple! Four rows of  enormous eight-sided pillars, close together, seem like a serried hedge  of gigantic oaks. Their strange capitals, bristling with a fantastic  vegetation of pinnacles, canopies, foliated niches and statues, are like  venerable trunks crowned with delicate and pendent mosses. They spread  out in great branches meeting in the vault overhead, the intervals of  the arches being filled with an inextricable network of foliage, thorny  sprigs and light branches, twining and intertwining, and figuring the  aerial dome of a mighty forest. As in a great wood, the lateral aisles  are almost equal in height to that of the center, and, on all sides, at  equal distances apart, one sees ascending around him the secular  colonnades.    Here truly is the ancient Germanic forest, as if a reminiscence of the  religious groves of Irmensul. Light pours in transformed by green,  yellow and purple panes, as if through the red and orange tints of  autumnal leaves. This, certainly, is a complete architecture like that  of Greece, having, like that of Greece, its root in vegetable forms. The  Greek takes the trunk of the tree, drest, for his type; the German the  entire tree with all its leaves and branches. True architecture,  perhaps, always springs out of vegetal nature, and each zone may have  its own edifices as well as plants; in this way oriental architectures  might be comprehended--the vague idea of the slender palm and of its  bouquet of leaves with the Arabs, and the vague idea of the colossal,  prolific, dilated and bristling vegetation of India.    In any event I have never seen a church in which the aspect of northern  forests was more striking, or where one more involuntarily imagines long  alleys of trunks terminating in glimpses of daylight, curved branches  meeting in acute angles, domes of irregular and commingling foliage,  universal shade scattered with lights through colored and diaphanous  leaves. Sometimes a section of yellow panes, through which the sun  darts, launches into the obscurity its shower of rays and a portion of  the nave glows like a luminous glade. A vast rosace behind the choir, a  window with tortuous branchings above the entrance, shimmer with the  tints of amethyst, ruby, emerald and topaz like leafy labyrinths in  which lights from above break in and diffuse themselves in shifting  radiance. Near the sacristy a small door-top, fastened against the wall,  exposes an infinity of intersecting moldings similar to the delicate  meshes of some marvelous twining and climbing plant. A day might be  passed here as in a forest, in the presence of grandeurs as solemn as  those of nature, before caprices as fascinating, amid the same  intermingling of sublime monotony and inexhaustible fecundity, before  contrasts and metamorphoses of light as rich and as unexpected. A mystic  reverie, combined with a fresh sentiment of northern nature, such is the  source of Gothic architecture.          PISA'S FOUR GLORIES[4]    BY HIPPOLYTE ADOLPHE TAINE      There are two Pisas--one in which people have lapsed into ennui, and  live from hand to mouth since the decadence, which is in fact the entire  city, except a remote corner; the other is this corner, a marble  sepulcher where the Duomo, Baptistery, Leaning Tower and Campo-Santo  silently repose like beautiful dead beings. This is the genuine Pisa,  and in these relics of a departed life, one beholds a world.    In 1083 in order to honor the Virgin, who had given them a victory over  the Saracens of Sardignia, they [the Pisans] laid the foundations of  their Duomo. This edifice is almost a Roman basilica, that is to say a  temple surmounted by another temple, or, if you prefer it, a house  having a gable for its facade which gable is cut off at the peak to  support another house of smaller dimensions. Five stories of columns  entirely cover the facade with their superposed porticos. Two by two  they stand coupled together to support small arcades; all these pretty  shapes of white marble under their dark arcades form an aerial  population of the utmost grace and novelty. Nowhere here are we  conscious of the dolorous reverie of the medieval north; it is the fete  of a young nation which is awakening, and, in the gladness of its recent  prosperity, honoring its gods. It has collected capitals, ornaments,  entire columns obtained on the distant shores to which its wars and its  commerce have led it, and these ancient fragments enter into its work  without incongruity; for it is instinctively cast in the ancient mold,  and only developed with a tinge of fancy on the side of finesse and the  pleasing. Every antique form reappears, but reshaped in the same sense  by a fresh and original impulse.    The outer columns of the Greek temple are reduced, multiplied and  uplifted in the air, and from a support have become an ornament. The  Roman or Byzantine dome is elongated and its natural heaviness  diminished under a crown of slender columns with a miter ornament, which  girds it midway with its delicate promenade. On the two sides of the  great door two Corinthian columns are enveloped with luxurious foliage,  calyxes and twining or blooming acanthus; and from the threshold we see  the church with its files of intersecting columns, its alternate courses  of black and white marble and its multitude of slender and brilliant  forms, rising upward like an altar of candelabra. A new spirit appears  here, a more delicate sensibility; it is not excessive and disordered as  in the north, and yet it is not satisfied with the grave simplicity, the  robust nudity of antique architecture. It is the daughter of the pagan  mother, healthy and gay, but more womanly than its mother.    She is not yet an adult, sure in all her steps--she is somewhat awkward.  The lateral facades on the exterior are monotonous; the cupola within  is a reversed funnel of a peculiar and disagreeable form. The junction  of the two arms of the cross is unsatisfactory and so many modernized  chapels dispel the charm due to purity, as at Sienna. At the second  glance however all this is forgotten, and we again regard it as a  complete whole. Four rows of Corinthian columns, surmounted with  arcades, divide the church into five naves, and form a forest. A second  passage, as richly crowded, traverses the former crosswise, and, above  the beautiful grove, files of still smaller columns prolong and  intersect each other in order to uphold in the air the prolongation and  intersection of the quadruple gallery. The ceiling is flat; the windows  are small, and for the most part, without sashes; they allow the walls  to retain the grandeur of their mass and the solidity of their position;  and among these long, straight and simple lines, in this natural light,  the innumerable shafts glow with the serenity of an antique temple....    Nothing more can be added in relation to the Baptistery or the Leaning  Tower; the same ideas prevail in these, the same taste, the same style.  The former is a simple, isolated dome, the latter a cylinder, and each  has an outward dress of small columns. And yet each has its own distinct  and expressive physiognomy; but description and writing consume too much  time, and too many technical "]]]
