[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17987"],[0,"The Mound Builders (#2)"],[1,"et. The  mound is eliptical at the base. The longest diameter, that is from  east to west, the same direction as the course of the river, is 117  feet. The corresponding shorter diameter from north to south is 90  feet. The circumference of the mound is consequently 325 feet. The  highest point of the mound is 45 feet above the surrounding level of  the earth. As to height the mound does not compare unfavorably with  the celebrated mound at Miamisburg, Ohio, known as one of the class of  \"observation mounds,\" which is 68 feet high and 852 feet around the  base. In addition to its purpose of sepulture, everything goes to show  that the \"Grand Mound\" of Rainy River was for observation as well.    THE EXCAVATION.    Two former attempts had been made to open this mound. One of these had  been made in the top, and the large skull before you was then  obtained. A more extensive effort was that made in 1883, by Mr. E.  McColl, Indian agent, Mr. Crowe, H. B. Co. officer of Fort Frances,  and a party of men. Their plan was to run a tunnel from north to south  through the base of the mound. They had penetrated some ten or fifteen  feet, found some articles of interest, and had then given up the  undertaking. Having employed a number of men, settlers in the  neighborhood, I determined to continue the tunnel for a certain  distance through the mound, all the way if indications were favorable,  and then to pierce the mound from the top. The men in two parties went  industriously to work on the opposite sides, working toward each  other, making a tunnel about eight feet in diameter. The earth though  originally soft soil had become so hard that it was necessary to use a  pick axe to loosen it for the spade. A number of skeletons were found  on the south side, but all I should say within ten feet from the  original surface of the mound. As we penetrated the interior fewer  remains were continually found. The earth gave many indications of  having been burnt. At one point the pick-axe sank ten inches into the  hard wall. This was about fifteen feet from the outside. The excavator  then dug out with his hand from a horizontal pocket in the earth eight  or ten inches wide and eighteen or twenty inches deep, a quantity of  soft brown dust, and a piece of bone some four inches long, a part of  a human forearm bone. This pocket was plainly the original resting  place of a skeleton, probably in a sitting posture. As deeper  penetration was made brown earthy spots without a trace of bone  remaining were come upon. The excavation on the south side was  continued for thirty feet into the mound, but at this stage it was  evident that bones, pottery, etc., had been so long interred that they  were reduced to dust. No hope seemed to remain now of finding objects  of interest in this direction, and so with about forty feet yet  wanting to complete, the tunnel, the search was transferred to the top  of the mound.    THE UPPER CUT.    Beginning on the crest of the mound, the mould was removed over a  considerable space, and though some trouble was found from the  presence of the roots of the growing trees, yet three or four feet  from the surface human bones and skeletons began to occur. In some  cases a complete skeleton was found, in other cases what seemed to be  a circle of skulls, buried alongside charred bones, fragments of  pottery and other articles. Several different excavations were made on  the mound surface, and it was found that every part from the base to  the crest contained bones and skeletons, to the depth of from six to  ten feet as already said; bones and articles of interest were found  thus far; deeper than this nothing. I shall now describe the articles  found in this mound, and refer in some cases to what has been found in  the other mounds of the Takawgamis.    NATURAL PRODUCTS.    1. _Bones_. Of the bones found, the skulls were the most interesting.  In some cases it would seem as if they alone of the bones had been  carried from a distance, perhaps from a distant part of the mound  builders' territory, from a battle field or some other spot. In some  cases this was proved, by the presence in the eye-sockets and cavities  of clay of a different kind from that of the mound, showing a previous  interment. The mound was plainly a sacred spot of the family or sept.  Before you are pieces of charred bone. Of the bones unburnt some were  of large size. There are before us two skulls, one from the grand  mound, the other from the Red River mound opened by the Society in  1879. The following are the measurements of the two skulls which I  have made carefully; and alongside the average measurements of the  Brachycephalic type given by Dr. Daniel Wilson, as well as of the  Dolichocephalic:                              AVERAGE      RAINY      RED       AVERAGE                            DOLICHO-     RIVER      RIVER     BRACHY-                            CEPHALIC.

As already stated it is only in some of the mounds that  charred wood is found. This specimen is from the mound at  Contcheteheng, at the head of Rainy River. It stands beside the  Rapids. This mound has supplied many interesting remains. From this  fact as well as from its situation, I would hazard the opinion that  here, as at the great Rainy River Falls, three miles farther down,  there were villages in the old mound building days. It is a fact  worthy of notice that the site of the first French Fort on Rainy  River, St. Pierre built by Verandrye in 1731, was a few hundred yards  from this mound.    3. _Bark_. Specimens of birch bark were found near by the bones. It  was no doubt originally used for swathing or wrapping the corpses  buried. That a soft decayable substance such as bark, should have  lasted while a number of bones had decayed may seem strange. No doubt  this may be explained in the same way as the presence among the  remains in Hochelaga, on the Island of Montreal, of preserved  fragments of maize, viz., by its having been scorched. The pieces of  bark seem to have been hardened by scorching.    4. _Earth_. The main earth of the mound is plainly the same as that of  the soil surrounding it. By what means the earth was piled up, is a  question for speculation. It seems a matter of small moment. Possibly  that the earth was carried in baskets, or vessels of considerable size  is sufficient to account for it. My theory is that the mound was not  erected by a vast company of busy workers as were the pyramids, but  that it was begun at first for purposes of observation, that as  interments were from time to time made in it sufficient earth was  carried up to effect the purpose, until in centuries the enormous  aggregate of earth was formed. Among the earth of the mound are also  found in spots, quantities of red and yellow ochre. The fact that the  skulls and bones seem often to have a reddish tinge, goes to show that  the ochre was used for the purpose of ornamentation. Sometimes a skull  is drawn out of the firm cast made by it in the earth, and the cast is  seen to be reddened by the ochre which was probably smeared over the  face of the slain warrior. The ochre is entirely foreign to the earth  of which the mound is made, but being earthy remains long after even  pottery has gone to decay.    5. _Ore_. Lying near this skull as if they had been placed in the  hands of the corpse were two pieces of metallic ore, one of which is  before you. A fresh section of it shows it to be Arsenical Iron  Pyrites, each piece weighing four or five ounces. No doubt the shining  ore and its heavy weight attracted notice, although it is of no  commercial value. The probabilities are that this ore was regarded as  sacred, and possibly having been considered valuable was placed beside  the corpse as the ancient obolus was laid beside the departed Greek to  pay his fare to crusty Charon.    [Illustration: FIGURE 1. MOUND BUILDERS' IMPLEMENTS.]    MANUFACTURED ARTICLES.    1. _Stone Implements_. The stone articles found, no doubt form a very  small proportion of the implements used by the lost race. I am able to  show you three classes of implements.    (_a_.) _Scrapers_. (See C. Figure 1.) These were made after the same  manner and from the same material as the flint arrow heads, found so  commonly all over this continent. They are usually of an oval or  elongated diamond shape, of various thicknesses, but thin at the  edges. Their purpose seems to have been to assist in skinning the  game, the larger for larger game, the smaller for rabbits and the  smaller fur bearing animals. Probably these implements were also used  for scraping the hides or skins manufactured into useful articles.    (_b_.) _Stone Axes and Malls_. In the mound on Red River was found the  beautiful axe of crystalline limestone, which approaches marble. From  the absence of stone so far as we know of this kind in this  neighborhood, it is safe to conclude that it came from a distant  locality. There are also gray stone celts and hammers used for  crushing corn, for hammering wood and bark for the canoes, and other  such like purposes, in time of peace; and serving as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/180"],[0,"The 1994 CIA World Factbook (#2)"],[1," midyear; also known as crude birth rate.    Dates of information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1994 was  used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are estimates for 1  July 1994, with population growth rates estimated for calendar year 1994. Major  political events have been updated through May 1994.    Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per l,000  population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.    Digraphs: The digraph is a two-letter \"country code\" that precisely identifies  every entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is the  digraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized geopolitical data element  promulgated in the  Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS)  10-3 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (US Department of  Commerce) and maintained by the Office of the Geographer (US Department of  State). The digraph is used to eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the  collection, processing, and dissemination of area-specific data and is  particularly useful for interchanging data between databases.    Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations with 183  nations, including 177 of the 184 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan,  Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Vietnam, and former Yugoslavia). In addition, the  US has diplomatic relations with 6 nations that are not in the UN - Holy See,  Kiribati, Nauru, Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.    Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official development  assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is defined as financial  assistance which is concessional in character, has the main objective to promote  economic development and welfare of LDCs. and contains a grant element of at  least 25%. OOF transactions are also official government assistance, but with a  main objective other than development and with a grant element less than 25%.  OOF transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im Bank credits),  official equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the  official sector that does not meet concessional terms. Aid is considered to have  been committed when agreements are initialed by the parties involved and  constitute a formal declaration of intent.    Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,  and governments included in this publication are not independent, and others are  not officially recognized by the US Government. \"Nation\" refers to a people  politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.  \"Dependent area\" refers to a broad category of political entities that are  associated in some way with a nation.

Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all final goods and services produced  within a nation in a given year.    Gross national product (GNP): The value of all final goods and services produced  within a nation in a given year, plus income earned abroad, minus income earned  by foreigners from domestic production.    Gross world product (GWP): The aggregate value of all goods and services  produced worldwide in a given year.    GNP/GDP methodology: In the \"Economy\" section, GNP/GDP dollar estimates for the  great majority of countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)  calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange rates.  The PPP method normally involves the use of international dollar price weights,  which are applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given  economy. In addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of  countries, the statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying,  and allowing for the quality of goods and services. The division of a GNP/GDP  estimate in local currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives  the PPP conversion rate. On average, one thousand dollars will buy the same  market basket of goods in the US as one thousand dollars--converted to the local  currency at the PPP conversion rate--will buy in the other country.  Whereas PPP  estimates for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing  countries are often rough approximations.  The latter estimates are based on  extrapolation of numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program  and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of  Pennsylvania and their colleagues.  Because currency exchange rates depend on a  variety of international and domestic financial forces that often have little  relation to domestic output, use of these rates is less satisfactory for  calculating GNP/GDP than the PPP method.  In developing countries with weak  currencies the exchange rate estimate of GNP/GDP in dollars is typically one-  fourth to one-half the PPP estimate.  Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly  go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas  real output has remained unchanged.  On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14  countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are tied to the  French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%.  This move, of course, did not  cut the real output of these countries by half.  One additional caution: the  proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP in local  currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNP/GDP  accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer estimates  the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures;    Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population, resulting  from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants  entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative.    Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs--narcotics,  stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These  categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well  as those illegally produced and sold outside medical channels.    Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides  hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,  Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish  (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).    Coca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the stimulant  cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and  is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.    Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.    Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include  chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital),  benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide  (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).    Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional, or  behavioral change in an individual.    Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in  physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual.    Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-awareness, and  emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc,  buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP,  angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others  (psilocybin, psilocyn).    Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).    Heroin is a"]]]
