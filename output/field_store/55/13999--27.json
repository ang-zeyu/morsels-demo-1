The _note_ (from _nota_--Latin--a mark or sign) consists of either  one, two, or three parts, ([Illustration]) these being referred to  respectively as head, stem, and hook. The hook is often called _tail_ or  cross-stroke. The stem appears on the right side of the head when turned  up, but on the left side when turned down.[1] [Illustration] The hook is  always on the right side.[2] [Illustration]    [Footnote 1: It should be noted at the outset that this statement  regarding the down-turned stem on the left side of the note-head, and  also a number of similar principles here cited, refer more specifically  to music as it appears on the printed page. In the case of hand-copied  music the down-turned stem appears on the right side of the note, thus  [note symbol]. This is done because of greater facility in writing, and  for the same reason other slight modifications of the notation here  recommended may sometimes be encountered. In dealing with children it is  best usually to follow as closely as possible the principles according  to which _printed_ music is notated, in order to avoid those  non-satisfying and often embarrassing explanations of differences which  will otherwise be unavoidable.]    [Footnote 2: An exception to this rule occurs in the case of notes of  unequal value stroked together, when the hook appears on the left side,  thus [Illustration].]         In writing music with pen the head and hook are best made with       a heavy pressure on the pen point, but in writing at the board       they are most easily made by using a piece of chalk about an       inch long, turned on its side.    2. When only one part (or voice) is written on the staff, the following  _rules for turning stems_ apply: (1) If the note-head is _below_ the  third line, the stem must turn up. (2) If the note-head is _above_ the  third line the stem must turn down. (3) If the note-head is _on_ the  third line the stem is turned either up or down with due regard to the  symmetrical appearance of the measure in which the note occurs. The  following examples will illustrate these points.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    3. When two parts are written on the same staff, the stems of the upper  part all turn up, and those of the lower part turn down, in order that  the parts may be clearly distinguished. (Fig. 2.) But in music for piano  and other instruments on which complete chords can be sounded by _one_  performer and also in simple, four-part vocal music in which all voices  have approximately the same rhythm, several notes often have one stem in  common as in Fig. 3.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]    4. Notes of small denomination (eighths and smaller) are often written  in groups of two or more, all stems in the group being then connected by  _one cross-stroke_. In such a case all the stems must of course be  turned the same way, the direction being determined by the position of  the majority of note-heads in the group. Notes thus _stroked_ may be of  the same or of different denomination. See Fig. 4.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]    In vocal music notes are never thus stroked when a syllable is given to  each note. (See p. 19, Sec. 55, C.)    5. _Rests_, like notes, are best made with a heavy pen stroke or by  using a piece of chalk on its side. (See note under Sec. 1.) The  double-whole rest, whole rest, and half rest occupy the third space  unless for the sake of clearness in writing two parts on the same staff  they are written higher or lower. The rests of smaller denomination may  be placed at any point on the staff, the hooks being always placed on  the spaces. The hook of the eighth rest is usually placed on the  _third_ space. Rests are sometimes dotted, but are never tied.    6. The _G clef_ should be begun at the second line rather than below the  staff. Experiments have shown clearly that beginners learn to make it  most easily in this way, and the process may be further simplified by  dividing it into two parts, thus, [Illustration]. The descending stroke  crosses the ascending curve at or near the fourth line. The circular  part of the curve occupies approximately the first and second spaces.    7. The _F clef_ is made either thus, [bass clef symbol], or thus, [old  bass clef symbol], the dots being placed one on either side of the  fourth line of the staff, which is the particular point that the clef  marks. The C _clef_ has also two forms, [C clef symbol] and [tenor clef  symbol].    8. The _sharp_ is made with two light vertical strokes, and two heavy  slanting ones, the slant of the latter being upward from left to right,  [sharp]. The sharp should never be made thus, [Illustration].    The _double sharp_ is made either thus [double-sharp symbol] or [old  double-sharp symbol], the first form being at present the more common.    9. The _flat_ is best made by a down stroke retraced part way up, the  curve being made without lifting pen from paper. The _double flat_  consists of two flats,[3] [flat][flat]. The _natural_ or _cancel_ is  made in two strokes, down-right and right-down, thus [Illustration].    [Footnote 3: It is to be hoped that the figure for the double-flat  suggested by Mattheson (who also suggested the St. Andrew's cross  ([symbol]) for the double-sharp) may some time be readopted. This figure  was the Greek letter B, made thus, [Greek: b], and its use would make  our notation one degree more uniform than it is at present.]    10. The _tie_ usually connects the _heads_ of notes, thus [tie symbol].    11. The _dot after a note_ always appears on a space, whether the  note-head is on a line or space. (See Fig. 5.) In the case of a dot  after a note on a line, the dot usually appears on the space _above_  that line if the next note is higher in position and on the space below  it if the following note is lower.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.]         _Note._--Correct notation must be made a habit rather than a       theory, and in order to form the habit of writing correctly,       _drill_ is necessary. This may perhaps be best secured by       asking students to write (at the board or on ruled paper) from       verbal dictation, thus: Teacher says,         \"Key of B[flat], three-quarter measure: First measure, DO a       quarter note, RE a quarter, and MI a quarter. Second measure,       SOL a quarter, LA a quarter, and SOL a quarter. Third measure,       LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, eighths, stroked in pairs. Fourth measure,       high DO a dotted half.\" Pupils respond by writing the exercise       dictated, after which mistakes in the turning of stems, etc.,       are corrected. The _pitch names_ may be dictated instead of       the syllables if desired, and still further practice may be       provided by asking that the exercise be transposed to other       keys.

I was alone in this strange  world, amidst the bowels of the earth.        Chapter III.      Slowly and cautiously I went my solitary way down the lamplit road and  towards the large building I have described. The road itself seemed like  a great Alpine pass, skirting rocky mountains of which the one through  whose chasm I had descended formed a link. Deep below to the left lay  a vast valley, which presented to my astonished eye the unmistakeable  evidences of art and culture. There were fields covered with a strange  vegetation, similar to none I have seen above the earth; the colour of  it not green, but rather of a dull and leaden hue or of a golden red.    There were lakes and rivulets which seemed to have been curved into  artificial banks; some of pure water, others that shone like pools of  naphtha. At my right hand, ravines and defiles opened amidst the rocks,  with passes between, evidently constructed by art, and bordered by trees  resembling, for the most part, gigantic ferns, with exquisite varieties  of feathery foliage, and stems like those of the palm-tree. Others were  more like the cane-plant, but taller, bearing large clusters of flowers.  Others, again, had the form of enormous fungi, with short thick stems  supporting a wide dome-like roof, from which either rose or drooped long  slender branches. The whole scene behind, before, and beside me far as  the eye could reach, was brilliant with innumerable lamps. The world  without a sun was bright and warm as an Italian landscape at noon, but  the air less oppressive, the heat softer. Nor was the scene before me  void of signs of habitation. I could distinguish at a distance, whether  on the banks of the lake or rivulet, or half-way upon eminences,  embedded amidst the vegetation, buildings that must surely be the homes  of men. I could even discover, though far off, forms that appeared to  me human moving amidst the landscape. As I paused to gaze, I saw to  the right, gliding quickly through the air, what appeared a small  boat, impelled by sails shaped like wings. It soon passed out of sight,  descending amidst the shades of a forest. Right above me there was no  sky, but only a cavernous roof. This roof grew higher and higher at the  distance of the landscapes beyond, till it became imperceptible, as an  atmosphere of haze formed itself beneath.    Continuing my walk, I started,--from a bush that resembled a great  tangle of sea-weeds, interspersed with fern-like shrubs and plants of  large leafage shaped like that of the aloe or prickly-pear,--a curious  animal about the size and shape of a deer. But as, after bounding away  a few paces, it turned round and gazed at me inquisitively, I perceived  that it was not like any species of deer now extant above the earth,  but it brought instantly to my recollection a plaster cast I had seen  in some museum of a variety of the elk stag, said to have existed before  the Deluge. The creature seemed tame enough, and, after inspecting me a  moment or two, began to graze on the singular herbiage around undismayed  and careless.        Chapter IV.      I now came in full sight of the building. Yes, it had been made by  hands, and hollowed partly out of a great rock. I should have supposed  it at the first glance to have been of the earliest form of Egyptian  architecture. It was fronted by huge columns, tapering upward from  massive plinths, and with capitals that, as I came nearer, I perceived  to be more ornamental and more fantastically graceful that Egyptian  architecture allows. As the Corinthian capital mimics the leaf of the  acanthus, so the capitals of these columns imitated the foliage of the  vegetation neighbouring them, some aloe-like, some fern-like. And now  there came out of this building a form--human;--was it human? It stood  on the broad way and looked around, beheld me and approached. It  came within a few yards of me, and at the sight and presence of it an  indescribable awe and tremor seized me, rooting my feet to the ground.  It reminded me of symbolical images of Genius or Demon that are seen on  Etruscan vases or limned on the walls of Eastern sepulchres--images that  borrow the outlines of man, and are yet of another race. It was tall,  not gigantic, but tall as the tallest man below the height of giants.    Its chief covering seemed to me to be composed of large wings folded  over its breast and reaching to its knees; the rest of its attire was  composed of an under tunic and leggings of some thin fibrous material.  It wore on its head a kind of tiara that shone with jewels, and carried  in its right hand a slender staff of bright metal like polished steel.  But the face! it was that which inspired my awe and my terror. It was  the face of man, but yet of a type of man distinct from our known extant  races. The nearest approach to it in outline and expression is the  face of the sculptured sphinx--so regular in its calm, intellectual,  mysterious beauty. Its colour was peculiar, more like that of the red  man than any other variety of our species, and yet different from it--a  richer and a softer hue, with large black eyes, deep and brilliant, and  brows arched as a semicircle. The face was beardless; but a nameless  something in the aspect, tranquil though the expression, and beauteous  though the features, roused that instinct of danger which the sight of  a tiger or serpent arouses. I felt that this manlike image was endowed  with forces inimical to man. As it drew near, a cold shudder came over  me. I fell on my knees and covered my face with my hands.        Chapter V.      A voice accosted me--a very quiet and very musical key of voice--in a  language of which I could not understand a word, but it served to  dispel my fear. I uncovered my face and looked up. The stranger (I could  scarcely bring myself to call him man) surveyed me with an eye that  seemed to read to the very depths of my heart. He then placed his left  hand on my forehead, and with the staff in his right, gently touched my  shoulder. The effect of this double contact was magical. In place of my  former terror there passed into me a sense of contentment, of joy, of  confidence in myself and in the being before me. I rose and spoke in  my own language. He listened to me with apparent attention, but with a  slight surprise in his looks; and shook his head, as if to signify that  I was not understood. He then took me by the hand and led me in silence  to the building. The entrance was open--indeed there was no door to it.  We entered an immense hall, lighted by the same kind of lustre as in the  scene without, but diffusing a fragrant odour. The floor was in large  tesselated blocks of precious metals, and partly covered with a sort of  matlike carpeting. A strain of low music, above and around, undulated as  if from invisible instruments, seeming to belong naturally to the place,  just as the sound of murmuring waters belongs to a rocky landscape, or  the warble of birds to vernal groves.    A figure in a simpler garb than that of my guide, but of similar  fashion, was standing motionless near the threshold. My guide touched  it twice with his staff, and it put itself into a rapid and gliding  movement, skimming noiselessly over the floor. Gazing on it, I then saw  that it was no living form, but a mechanical automaton. It might be two  minutes after it vanished through a doorless opening, half screened by  curtains at the other end of the hall, when through the same opening  advanced a boy of about twelve years old, with features closely  resembling those of my guide, so that they seemed to me evidently son  and father. On seeing me the child uttered a cry, and lifted a staff  like that borne by my guide, as if in menace. At a word from the elder  he dropped it. The two then conversed for some moments, examining me  while they spoke. The child touched my garments, and stroked my face  with evident curiosity, uttering a sound like a laugh, but with an  hilarity more subdued that the mirth of our laughter. Presently the roof  of the hall opened, and a platform descended, seemingly constructed  on the same principle as the 'lifts' used in hotels and warehouses for  mounting from one story to another.    The stranger placed himself and the child on the platform, and motioned  to me to do the same, which I did. We ascended quickly and safely, and  alighted in the midst of a corridor with doorways on either side.    Through one of these doorways I was conducted into a chamber fitted up  with an oriental splendour; the walls were tesselated with spars, and  metals, and uncut jewels; cushions and divans abounded; apertures as for  windows but unglazed, were made in the chamber opening to the floor;  and as I passed along I observed that these openings led into spacious  balconies, and commanded views of the illumined landscape without. In  cages suspended from the ceiling there were birds of strange form and  bright plumage, which at our entrance set up a chorus of song, modulated  into tune as is that of our piping bullfinches. A delicious fragrance,  from censers of gold elaborately sculptured, filled the air. Several  automata, like the one I had seen, stood dumb and motionless by the  walls. The stranger placed me beside him on a divan and again spoke  to me, and again I spoke, but without the least advance towards  understanding each other.    But now I began to feel the effects of the blow I had received from the  splinters of the falling rock more acutely that I had done at first.    There came over me a sense of sickly faintness, accompanied with acute,  lancinating pains in the head and neck. I sank back on the seat and  strove in vain to stifle a groan. On this the child, who had hitherto  seemed to eye me with distrust or dislike, knelt by my side to support"]]]
