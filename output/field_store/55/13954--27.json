They began to climb again, across slimed rock where there were evil  trails of other things which lived in this haunted darkness. But the sun  of Asti lighted their way and perhaps some virtue in the rays from it  kept away the makers of such trails.    When they pulled themselves up onto a wide ledge the talons on Varta's  gloves were worn to splintered stubs and there was a bright girdle of  pain about her aching body. Lur lay panting beside her, his red-forked  tongue protruding from his foam ringed mouth.    \"We walk again the ways of men,\" Lur was the first to note the tool  marks on the stone where they lay. \"By the Will of Asti, we may win out  of this maze after all.\"    Since there were no signs of the deadly steam Varta dared to push off  her hood and share with her companion the sustaining power she carried  in her pouch. There was a freshness to the air they breathed, damp and  cold though it was, which hinted of the upper world.    The ledge sloped upwards, at a steep angle at first, and then more  gently. Lur slipped past her and thrust head and shoulders through a  break in the rock. Grasping his neck spines she allowed him to pull her  through that narrow slit into the soft blackness of a surface night.  They tumbled down together, Varta's head pillowed on Lur's smooth side,  and so slept as the sun and worlds of Asti whirled protectingly above  them.    A whir of wings in the air above her head awakened Varta. One of the  small, jewel bright flying lizard creatures of the deep jungle poised  and dipped to investigate more closely the worlds of Asti. But at  Varta's upflung arm it uttered a rasping cry and planed down into the  mass of vegetation below. By the glint of sunlight on the stone around  them the day was already well advanced. Varta tugged at Lur's mane until  he roused.    There was a regularity to the rocks piled about their sleeping place  which hinted that they had lain among the ruins left by man. But of this  side of the mountains both were ignorant, for Memphir's rule had not run  here.    \"Many dead things in times past,\" Lur's scarlet nostril pits were  extended to their widest. \"But that was long ago. This land is no longer  held by men.\"    Varta laughed cheerfully. \"If here there are no men, then there will  rise no barbarian hordes to dispute our rule. Asti has led us to safety.  Let us see more of the land He gives us.\"    There was a road leading down from the ruins, a road still to be  followed in spite of the lash of landslip and the crack of time. And it  brought them into a cup of green fertility where the lavishness of  Asti's sowing was unchecked by man. Varta seized eagerly upon globes of  blood red fruit which she recognized as delicacies which had been  cultivated in the Temple gardens, while Lur went hunting into the  fringes of the jungle, there dining on prey so easily caught as to be  judged devoid of fear.    The jungle choked highway curved and they were suddenly fronted by a  desert of sere desolation, a desert floored by glassy slag which sent  back the sun beams in a furnace glare. Varta shaded her eyes and tried  to see the end of this, but, if there was a distant rim of green beyond,  the heat distortions in the air concealed it.    Lur put out a front paw to test the slag but withdrew it instantly.    \"It cooks the flesh, we can not walk here,\" was his verdict.    Varta pointed with her chin to the left where, some distance away, the  mountain wall paralleled their course.    \"Then let us keep to the jungle over there and see if it does not bring  around to the far side. But what made this--?\" She leaned out over the  glassy stuff, not daring to touch the slick surface.    \"War.\" Lur's tongue shot out to impale a questing beetle. \"These  forgotten people fought with fearsome weapons.\"    \"But what weapon could do this? Memphir knew not such--.\"    \"Memphir was old. But mayhap there were those who raised cities on Erb  before the first hut of Memphir squatted on tidal mud. Men forget  knowledge in time. Even in Memphir the lords of the last days forgot the  wisdom of their earlier sages--they fell before the barbarians easily  enough.\"    \"If ever men had wisdom to produce this--it was not of Asti's giving,\"  she edged away from the glare. \"Let us go.\"    But now they had to fight their way through jungle and it was  hard--until they reached a ridge of rock running out from the mountain  as a tongue thrust into the blasted valley. And along this they picked  their slow way.    \"There is water near--,\" Lur's thought answered the girl's desire. She  licked dry lips longingly. \"This way--,\" her companion's sudden turn was  to the left and Varta was quick to follow him down a slide of rock.    Lur's instinct was right, as it ever was. There was water before them, a  small lake of it. But even as he dipped his fanged muzzle toward that  inviting surface, Lur's spined head jerked erect again. Varta snatched  back the hand she had put out, staring at Lur's strange actions. His  nostrils expanded to their widest, his long neck outstretched, he was  swinging his head back and forth across the limpid shallows.    \"What is it--?\"    \"This is no water such as we know,\" the scaled one answered flatly. \"It  has life within it.\"    Varta laughed. \"Fish, water snakes, your own distant kin, Lur. It is the  scent of them which you catch--\"    \"No. It is the water itself which lives--and yet does not live--\" His  thought trailed away from her as he struggled with some problem. No  human brain could follow his unless he willed it so.    Varta squatted back on her heels and began to look at the water and then  at the banks with more care. For the first time she noted the odd  patches of brilliant color which floated just below the surface of the  liquid. Blue, green, yellow, crimson, they drifted slowly with the tiny  waves which lapped the shore. But they were not alive, she was almost  sure of that, they appeared more a part of the water itself.    Watching the voyage of one patch of green she caught sight of the  branch. It was a drooping shoot of the turbi, the same tree vine which  produced the fruit she had relished less than an hour before. Above the  water dangled a cluster of the fruit, dead ripe with the sweet pulp  stretching its skin. But below the surface of the water--    Varta's breath hissed between her teeth and Lur's head snapped around as  he caught her thought.    The branch below the water bore a perfect circle of green flowers close  to its tip, the flowers which the turbi had borne naturally seven months  before and which should long ago have turned into just such sweetness as  hung above.    With Lur at her heels the girl edged around to pull cautiously at the  branch. It yielded at once to her touch, swinging its tip out of the  lake. She sniffed--there was a languid perfume in the air, the perfume  of the blooming turbi. She examined the flowers closely, to all  appearances they were perfect and natural.    \"It preserves,\" Lur settled back on his haunches and waved one front paw  at the quiet water. \"What goes into it remains as it was just at the  moment of entrance.\"    \"But if this is seven months old--\"    \"It may be seven years old,\" corrected Lur. \"How can you tell when that  branch first dipped into the lake? Yet the flowers do not fade even when  withdrawn from the water. This is indeed a mystery!\"    \"Of which I would know more!\" Varta dropped the turbi and started on  around the edge of the lake.    Twice more they found similar evidence of preservation in flower or  leaf, wherever it was covered by the opaline water.    The lake itself was a long and narrow slash with one end cutting into  the desert of glass while the other wet the foot of the mountain. And it  was there, on the slope of the mountain that they found the greatest  wonder of all, Lur scenting it before they sighted the remains among the  stones.    \"Man made,\" he cautioned, \"but very, very old.\"    And truly the wreckage they came upon must have been old, perhaps even  older than Memphir. For the part which rested above the water was almost  gone, rusty red stains on the rocks outlining where it had lain. But  under water was a smooth silver hull, shining and untouched by the  years. Varta laid her hand upon a ruddy scrap between two rocks and it  became a drift of powdery dust. And yet--there a few feet below was  strong metal!    Lur padded along the scrap of shore surveying the thing.    \"It was a machine in which men traveled,\" his thoughts arose to her.  \"But they were not as the men of Memphir. Perhaps not even as the sons  of Erb--\"    \"Not as the sons of Erb!\" her astonishment broke into open speech.    Lur's neck twisted as he looked up at her. \"Did the men of Erb, even in  the old chronicles fight with weapons such as would make a desert of  glass? There are other worlds than Erb, mayhap this strange thing was a  sky ship from such a world. All things are possible by the Will of  Asti.\"    Varta nodded. \"All things are possible by the Will of Asti,\" she  repeated. \"But, Lur,\" her eyes were round with wonder, \"perhaps it is  Asti's Will which brought us here to find this marvel! Perhaps He has  some use for us and it!\"    \"At least we may discover what lies within it,\" Lur had his own share of  curiosity.    \"How? The two of us can not draw that out of the water!\"    \"No, but we can enter into it!\"    Varta fingered the folds of the hood on her shoulders. She knew what Lur  meant, the suit which had protected her in the underworld was impervious  to everything outside its surface--or to every substance its makers  knew--just as Lur's own hide made his flesh impenetrable. But the  fashioners of her suit had probably never known of the living lake and  what if she had no defense against the strange properties of the water?    She leaned back against a rock.

PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.      Of all the frauds practised by mercenary dealers, there is none more  reprehensible, and at the same time more prevalent, than the  sophistication of the various articles of food.    This unprincipled and nefarious practice, increasing in degree as it has  been found difficult of detection, is now applied to almost every  commodity which can be classed among either the necessaries or the  luxuries of life, and is carried on to a most alarming extent in every  part of the United Kingdom.    It has been pursued by men, who, from the magnitude and apparent  respectability of their concerns, would be the least obnoxious to public  suspicion; and their successful example has called forth, from among the  retail dealers, a multitude of competitors in the same iniquitous  course.    To such perfection of ingenuity has this system of adulterating food  arrived, that spurious articles of various kinds are every where to be  found, made up so skilfully as to baffle the discrimination of the most  experienced judges.    Among the number of substances used in domestic economy which are now  very generally found sophisticated, may be distinguished--tea, coffee,  bread, beer, wine, spiritous liquors, salad oil, pepper, vinegar,  mustard, cream, and other articles of subsistence.    Indeed, it would be difficult to mention a single article of food which  is not to be met with in an adulterated state; and there are some  substances which are scarcely ever to be procured genuine.    Some of these spurious compounds are comparatively harmless when used  as food; and as in these cases merely substances of inferior value are  substituted for more costly and genuine ingredients, the sophistication,  though it may affect our purse, does not injure our health. Of this kind  are the manufacture of factitious pepper, the adulterations of mustard,  vinegar, cream, &c. Others, however, are highly deleterious; and to this  class belong the adulterations of beer, wines, spiritous liquors,  pickles, salad oil, and many others.    There are particular chemists who make it a regular trade to supply  drugs or nefarious preparations to the unprincipled brewer of porter or  ale; others perform the same office to the wine and spirit merchant; and  others again to the grocer and the oilman. The operators carry on their  processes chiefly in secresy, and under some delusive firm, with the  ostensible denotements of a fair and lawful establishment.    These illicit pursuits have assumed all the order and method of a  regular trade; they may severally claim to be distinguished as an _art  and mystery_; for the workmen employed in them are often wholly ignorant  of the nature of the substances which pass through their hands, and of  the purposes to which they are ultimately applied.    To elude the vigilance of the inquisitive, to defeat the scrutiny of the  revenue officer, and to ensure the secresy of these mysteries, the  processes are very ingeniously divided and subdivided among individual  operators, and the manufacture is purposely carried on in separate  establishments. The task of proportioning the ingredients for use is  assigned to one individual, while the composition and preparation of  them may be said to form a distinct part of the business, and is  entrusted to another workman. Most of the articles are transmitted to  the consumer in a disguised state, or in such a form that their real  nature cannot possibly be detected by the unwary. Thus the extract of  _coculus indicus_, employed by fraudulent manufacturers of malt-liquors  to impart an intoxicating quality to porter or ales, is known in the  market by the name of _black extract_, ostensibly destined for the use  of tanners and dyers. It is obtained by boiling the berries of the  coculus indicus in water, and converting, by a subsequent evaporation,  this decoction into a stiff black tenacious mass, possessing, in a high  degree, the narcotic and intoxicating quality of the poisonous berry  from which it is prepared. Another substance, composed of extract of  quassia and liquorice juice, used by fraudulent brewers to economise  both malt and hops, is technically called _multum_.[1]    The quantities of coculus indicus berries, as well as of black extract,  imported into this country for adulterating malt liquors, are enormous.  It forms a considerable branch of commerce in the hands of a few  brokers: yet, singular as it may seem, no inquiry appears to have been  hitherto made by the officers of the revenue respecting its application.  Many other substances employed in the adulteration of beer, ale, and  spiritous liquors, are in a similar manner intentionally disguised; and  of the persons by whom they are purchased, a great number are totally  unacquainted with their nature or composition.    An extract, said to be innocent, sold in casks, containing from half a  cwt. to five cwt. by the brewers' druggists, under the name of  _bittern_, is composed of calcined sulphate of iron (copperas), extract  of coculus indicus berries, extract of quassia, and Spanish liquorice.    It would be very easy to adduce, in support of these remarks, the  testimony of numerous individuals, by whom I have been professionally  engaged to examine certain mixtures, said to be perfectly innocent,  which are used in very extensive manufactories of the above description.  Indeed, during the long period devoted to the practice of my  profession, I have had abundant reason to be convinced that a vast  number of dealers, of the highest respectability, have vended to their  customers articles absolutely poisonous, which they themselves  considered as harmless, and which they would not have offered for sale,  had they been apprised of the spurious and pernicious nature of the  compounds, and of the purposes to which they were destined.    For instance, I have known cases in which brandy merchants were not  aware that the substance which they frequently purchase under the  delusive name of _flash_, for strengthening and clarifying spiritous  liquors, and which is held out as consisting of burnt sugar and  isinglass only, in the form of an extract, is in reality a compound of  sugar, with extract of capsicum; and that to the acrid and pungent  qualities of the capsicum is to be ascribed the heightened flavour of  brandy and rum, when coloured with the above-mentioned matter.    In other cases the ale-brewer has been supplied with ready-ground  coriander seeds, previously mixed with a portion of _nux vomica_ and  quassia, to give a bitter taste and narcotic property to the beverage.    The retail venders of mustard do not appear to be aware that mustard  seed alone cannot produce, when ground, a powder of so intense and  brilliant a colour as that of the common mustard of commerce. Nor would  the powder of real mustard, when mixed with salt and water, without the  addition of a portion of pulverised capsicum, keep for so long a time as  the mustard usually offered for sale.    Many other instances of unconscious deceptions might be mentioned, which  were practised by persons of upright and honourable minds.    It is a painful reflection, that the division of labour which has been  so instrumental in bringing the manufactures of this country to their  present flourishing state, should have also tended to conceal and  facilitate the fraudulent practices in question; and that from a  correspondent ramification of commerce into a multitude of distinct  branches, particularly in the metropolis and the large towns of the  empire, the traffic in adulterated commodities should find its way  through so many circuitous channels, as to defy the most scrutinising  endeavour to trace it to its source.    It is not less lamentable that the extensive application of chemistry to  the useful purposes of life, should have been perverted into an  auxiliary to this nefarious traffic. But, happily for the science, it  may, without difficulty, be converted into a means of detecting the  abuse; to effect which, very little chemical skill is required; and the  course to be pursued forms the object of the following pages.    The baker asserts that he does not put alum into bread; but he is well  aware that, in purchasing a certain quantity of flour, he must take a  sack of _sharp whites_ (a term given to flour contaminated with a  quantity of alum), without which it would be impossible for him to  produce light, white, and porous bread, from a half-spoiled material.    The wholesale mealman frequently purchases this spurious commodity,  (which forms a separate branch of business in the hands of certain  individuals,) in order to enable himself to sell his decayed and  half-spoiled flour.    Other individuals furnish the baker with alum mixed up with salt, under  the obscure denomination of _stuff_. There are wholesale manufacturing  chemists, whose sole business is to crystallise alum, in such a form as  will adapt this salt to the purpose of being mixed in a crystalline  state with the crystals of common salt, to disguise the character of  the compound. The mixture called _stuff_, is composed of one part of  alum, in minute crystals, and three of common salt. In many other trades  a similar mode of proceeding prevails. Potatoes are soaked in water to  augment their weight.    The practice of sophisticating the necessaries of life, being reduced to  systematic regularity, is ranked by public opinion among other  mercantile pursuits; and is not only regarded with less disgust than  formerly, but is almost generally esteemed as a justifiable way to  wealth.    It is really astonishing that the penal law is not more effectually  enforced against practices so inimical to the public welfare. The man  who robs "]]]
