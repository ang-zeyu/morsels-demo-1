O My Brother! Until thou enter the Egypt of love, thou shalt never come to  the Joseph of the Beauty of the Friend; and until, like Jacob, thou  forsake thine outward eyes, thou shalt never open the eye of thine inward  being; and until thou burn with the fire of love, thou shalt never commune  with the Lover of Longing.    A lover feareth nothing and no harm can come nigh him: Thou seest him  chill in the fire and dry in the sea.      A lover is he who is chill in hell fire;    A knower is he who is dry in the sea.(15)    Love accepteth no existence and wisheth no life: He seeth life in death,  and in shame seeketh glory. To merit the madness of love, man must abound  in sanity; to merit the bonds of the Friend, he must be full of spirit.  Blessed the neck that is caught in His noose, happy the head that falleth  on the dust in the pathway of His love. Wherefore, O friend, give up thy  self that thou mayest find the Peerless One, pass by this mortal earth  that thou mayest seek a home in the nest of heaven. Be as naught, if thou  wouldst kindle the fire of being and be fit for the pathway of love.      Love seizeth not upon a living soul,    The falcon preyeth not on a dead mouse.(16)    Love setteth a world aflame at every turn, and he wasteth every land where  he carrieth his banner. Being hath no existence in his kingdom; the wise  wield no command within his realm. The leviathan of love swalloweth the  master of reason and destroyeth the lord of knowledge. He drinketh the  seven seas, but his heart's thirst is still unquenched, and he saith, \"Is  there yet any more?\"(17) He shunneth himself and draweth away from all on  earth.      Love's a stranger to earth and heaven too;    In him are lunacies seventy-and-two.(18)    He hath bound a myriad victims in his fetters, wounded a myriad wise men  with his arrow. Know that every redness in the world is from his anger,  and every paleness in men's cheeks is from his poison. He yieldeth no  remedy but death, he walketh not save in the valley of the shadow; yet  sweeter than honey is his venom on the lover's lips, and fairer his  destruction in the seeker's eyes than a hundred thousand lives.    Wherefore must the veils of the satanic self be burned away at the fire of  love, that the spirit may be purified and cleansed and thus may know the  station of the Lord of the Worlds.      Kindle the fire of love and burn away all things,    Then set thy foot into the land of the lovers.(19)    And if, confirmed by the Creator, the lover escapes from the claws of the  eagle of love, he will enter          The Valley of Knowledge      and come out of doubt into certitude, and turn from the darkness of  illusion to the guiding light of the fear of God. His inner eyes will open  and he will privily converse with his Beloved; he will set ajar the gate  of truth and piety, and shut the doors of vain imaginings. He in this  station is content with the decree of God, and seeth war as peace, and  findeth in death the secrets of everlasting life. With inward and outward  eyes he witnesseth the mysteries of resurrection in the realms of creation  and the souls of men, and with a pure heart apprehendeth the divine wisdom  in the endless Manifestations of God. In the ocean he findeth a drop, in a  drop he beholdeth the secrets of the sea.      Split the atom's heart, and lo!    Within it thou wilt find a sun.(20)    The wayfarer in this Valley seeth in the fashionings of the True One  nothing save clear providence, and at every moment saith: \"No defect canst  thou see in the creation of the God of Mercy: Repeat the gaze: Seest thou  a single flaw?\"(21) He beholdeth justice in injustice, and in justice,  grace. In ignorance he findeth many a knowledge hidden, and in knowledge a  myriad wisdoms manifest. He breaketh the cage of the body and the  passions, and consorteth with the people of the immortal realm. He  mounteth on the ladders of inner truth and hasteneth to the heaven of  inner significance. He rideth in the ark of \"we shall show them our signs  in the regions and in themselves,\"(22) and journeyeth over the sea of  \"until it become plain to them that (this Book) is the truth.\"(23) And if  he meeteth with injustice he shall have patience, and if he cometh upon  wrath he shall manifest love.    There was once a lover who had sighed for long years in separation from  his beloved, and wasted in the fire of remoteness. From the rule of love,  his heart was empty of patience, and his body weary of his spirit; he  reckoned life without her as a mockery, and time consumed him away. How  many a day he found no rest in longing for her; how many a night the pain  of her kept him from sleep; his body was worn to a sigh, his heart's wound  had turned him to a cry of sorrow. He had given a thousand lives for one  taste of the cup of her presence, but it availed him not. The doctors knew  no cure for him, and companions avoided his company; yea, physicians have  no medicine for one sick of love, unless the favor of the beloved one  deliver him.    At last, the tree of his longing yielded the fruit of despair, and the  fire of his hope fell to ashes. Then one night he could live no more, and  he went out of his house and made for the marketplace. On a sudden, a  watchman followed after him. He broke into a run, with the watchman  following; then other watchmen came together, and barred every passage to  the weary one. And the wretched one cried from his heart, and ran here and  there, and moaned to himself: \"Surely this watchman is Izra'il, my angel  of death, following so fast upon me; or he is a tyrant of men, seeking to  harm me.\" His feet carried him on, the one bleeding with the arrow of  love, and his heart lamented. Then he came to a garden wall, and with  untold pain he scaled it, for it proved very high; and forgetting his  life, he threw himself down to the garden.    And there he beheld his beloved with a lamp in her hand, searching for a  ring she had lost. When the heart-surrendered lover looked on his  ravishing love, he drew a great breath and raised up his hands in prayer,  crying: \"O God! Give Thou glory to the watchman, and riches and long life.  For the watchman was Gabriel, guiding this poor one; or he was Israfil,  bringing life to this wretched one!\"    Indeed, his words were true, for he had found many a secret justice in  this seeming tyranny of the watchman, and seen how many a mercy lay hid  behind the veil. Out of wrath, the guard had led him who was athirst in  love's desert to the sea of his loved one, and lit up the dark night of  absence with the light of reunion. He had driven one who was afar, into  the garden of nearness, had guided an ailing soul to the heart's  physician.    Now if the lover could have looked ahead, he would have blessed the  watchman at the start, and prayed on his behalf, and he would have seen  that tyranny as justice; but since the end was veiled to him, he moaned  and made his plaint in the beginning. Yet those who journey in the garden  land of knowledge, because they see the end in the beginning, see peace in  war and friendliness in anger.    Such is the state of the wayfarers in this Valley; but the people of the  Valleys above this see the end and the beginning as one; nay, they see  neither beginning nor end, and witness neither \"first\" nor \"last.\"(24) Nay  rather, the denizens of the undying city, who dwell in the green garden  land, see not even \"neither first nor last\"; they fly from all that is  first, and repulse all that is last. For these have passed over the worlds  of names, and fled beyond the worlds of attributes as swift as lightning.  Thus is it said: \"Absolute Unity excludeth all attributes.\"(25) And they  have made their dwelling-place in the shadow of the Essence.    Wherefore, relevant to this, Khajih 'Abdu'llah(26)--may God the Most High  sanctify his beloved spirit--hath made a subtle point and spoken an  eloquent word as to the meaning of \"Guide Thou us on the straight  path,\"(27) which is: \"Show us the right way, that is, honor us with the  love of Thine Essence, that we may be freed from turning toward ourselves  and toward all else save Thee, and may become wholly Thine, and know only  Thee, and see only Thee, and think of none save Thee.\"    Nay, these even mount above this station, wherefore it is said:      Love is a veil betwixt the lover and the loved one;    More than this I am not permitted to tell.(28)    At this hour the morn of knowledge hath arisen and the lamps of wayfaring  and wandering are quenched.(29)      Veiled from this was Moses    Though all strength and light;    Then thou who hast no wings at all,    Attempt not flight.(30)    If thou be a man of communion and prayer, soar up on the wings of  assistance from Holy Souls, that thou mayest behold the mysteries of the  Friend and attain to the lights of the Beloved, \"Verily, we are from God  and to Him shall we return.\"(31)    After passing through the Valley of knowledge, which is the last plane of  limitation, the wayfarer cometh to          The Valley of Unity      and drinketh from the cup of the Absolute, and gazeth on the  Manifestations of Oneness. In this station he pierceth the veils of  plurality, fleeth from the worlds of the flesh, and ascendeth into the  heaven of singleness. With the ear of God he heareth, with the eye of God  he beholdeth the mysteries of divine creation. He steppeth into the  sanctuary of the Friend, and shareth as an intimate the pavilion of the  Loved One. He stretcheth out the hand of truth from the sleeve of the  Absolute; he revealeth the secrets of power. He seeth in himself neither  name nor fame nor rank, but findeth his own praise in praising God. He  beholdeth in his own name the name of God; to him, \"all songs are from the  King,\"(32) and every melody from Him.

Even so the sterner  phenomena of nature--whirlwind and tempest, lightning and thunder, flood  and storm-wave, plague, pestilence, and famine; all of these oftentimes  assume in the East a character of awful majesty before which man cowers  in helplessness and despair. The conceptions and feelings hence arising  have from the beginning powerfully affected the religion of the Hindus.  Every-where we can trace the impress of the grander manifestations of  nature--the impress of their beneficence, their beauty, their might,  their mystery, or their terribleness.    [Sidenote: The deities are \"the bright ones,\" according to the language  of the sacred books of India.]  The Sanskrit word for god is _deva_, which means _bright, shining_. Of  physical phenomena it was especially those connected with light that  enkindled feelings of reverence. The black thunder-cloud that enshrouded  nature, in which the demon had bound the life-giving waters, passed  away; for the glittering thunder-bolt was launched, and the streams  rushed down, exulting in their freedom; and then the heaven shone out  again, pure and peaceful as before. But such a wonder as the dawn--with  far-streaming radiance, returning from the land of mystery, fresh in  eternal youth, and scattering the terrors of the night before her--who  could sufficiently admire? And let it be remembered that in the Hindu  mind the interval between admiration and adoration is exceedingly small.  Yet, while it is the dawn which has evoked the truest poetry, she has  not retained the highest place in worship.    [Sidenote: Fire much worshiped.]  No divinity has fuller worship paid him than Agni, the Fire (_Ignis_).  More hymns are dedicated to him than to any other being. Astonishment at  the properties of fire; a sense of his condescension in that he, a  mighty god, resides in their dwellings; his importance as the messenger  between heaven and earth, bearing the offerings aloft; his kindness at  night in repelling the darkness and the demons which it hides--all these  things raised Agni to an exalted place. He is fed with pure clarified  butter, and so rises heavenward in his brightness. The physical  conception of fire, however, adheres to him, and he never quite ceases  to be the earthly flame; yet mystical conceptions thickly gather round  this root-idea; he is fire pervading all nature; and he often becomes  supreme, a god of gods.    [Sidenote: Soma highly exalted.  Soma becomes a very mighty god.]  All this seems natural enough; but one is hardly prepared for the high  exaltation to which Soma is raised. Soma is properly the juice of a  milky plant (_asclepias acida_, or _sarcostemma viminale_), which, when  fermented, is intoxicating. The simple-minded Aryas were both astonished  and delighted at its effects; they liked it themselves; and they knew  nothing more precious to present to their gods. Accordingly, all of  these rejoice in it. Indra in particular quaffs it \"like a thirsty  stag;\" and under its exhilarating effects he strides victoriously to  battle. Soma itself becomes a god, and a very mighty one; he is even the  creator and father of the gods;[3] the king of gods and men;[4] all  creatures are in his hand. It is surely extraordinary that the Aryas  could apply such hyperbolical laudations to the liquor which they had  made to trickle into the vat, and which they knew to be the juice of a  plant they had cut down on the mountains and pounded in a mortar; and  that intoxication should be confounded with inspiration. Yet of such  aberrations we know the human mind is perfectly capable.    [Sidenote: Connection with Persian, Greek, and Roman systems.  Varuna, the god of heaven.  The sublimity of the Vedic description of him.]  We have first referred to Agni and Soma, as being the only divinities of  highest rank which still retain their physical character. The worship  paid to them was of great antiquity; for it is also prescribed in the  Persian Avesta, and must have been common to the Indo-Iranian branch of  the Aryan race before the Hindus entered India. But we can inferentially  go still further back and speak of a deity common to the Greeks, Romans,  Persians, and Hindus. This deity is Varuna, the most remarkable  personality in the Veda. The name, which is etymologically connected  with [Greek: Ouranos], signifies \"the encompasser,\" and is applied to  heaven--especially the all-encompassing, extreme vault of heaven--not  the nearer sky, which is the region of cloud and storm. It is in  describing Varuna that the Veda rises to the greatest sublimity which it  ever reaches. A mysterious presence, a mysterious power, a mysterious  knowledge amounting almost to omniscience, are ascribed to Varuna. The  winkings of men's eyes are numbered by him. He upholds order, both  physical and moral, throughout the universe.    [Sidenote: Contrast with the laudations of Agni and Soma.  The loftier conceptions of divinity the earlier.]  The winds are his breath, the sun his eye, the sky his garment. He  rewards the good and punishes the wicked. Yet to the truly penitent he  is merciful. It is absolutely confounding to pass from a hymn that  celebrates the serene majesty and awful purity of Varuna to one filled  with measureless laudations of Soma or Agni. Could conceptions of  divinity so incongruous co-exist? That they could not spring up in the  same mind, or even in the same age, is abundantly manifest. And, as we  have mentioned, the loftier conceptions of divinity are unquestionably  the earlier. It is vain to speak, as certain writers do, of religion  gradually refining itself, as a muddy stream can run itself pure;  Hinduism resembles the Ganges, which, when it breaks forth from its  mountain cradle at Hardwar, is comparatively pellucid, but, as it rolls  on, becomes more and more muddy, discolored, and unclean.[5]    [Sidenote: Indra.  His achievements.]  Various scholars affirm that Varuna, in more ancient pre-Vedic times,  held a position still higher than the very high one which he still  retains. This is probable; indeed, it is certain that, before later  divinities had intruded, he held a place of unrivaled majesty. But, in  the Vedas, Indra is a more conspicuous figure. He corresponds to the  Jupiter Pluvius of the Romans. In north-western India, after the burning  heat, the annual return of the rains was hailed with unspeakable joy; it  was like life succeeding death. The clouds that floated up from the  ocean were at first thin and light; ah! a hostile demon was in them,  carrying off the healing waters and not permitting them to fall; but the  thunder-bolt of Indra flashed; the demon was driven away howling, and  the emancipated streams refreshed the thirsty earth. Varuna was not  indeed dethroned, but he was obscured, by the achievements of the  warlike Indra; and the supersensuous, moral conceptions that were  connected with the former gradually faded from the minds of the people,  and Varuna erelong became quite a subordinate figure in the Pantheon.    [Sidenote: Number and relations of deities uncertain.]  The deities are generally said in the Veda to be \"thrice eleven\" in  number. We also hear of three thousand three hundred and thirty-nine.  There is no _system_, no fixed order in the hierarchy; a deity who in  one hymn is quite subordinate becomes in another supreme; almost every  god becomes supreme in turn; in one hymn he is the son of some deity and  in another that deity's father, and so (if logic ruled) his own  grandfather. Every poet exalts his favorite god, till the mind becomes  utterly bewildered in tracing the relationships.    We have already spoken of Agni, Varuna, and Indra, as well as Soma. Next  to these in importance may come the deities of light, namely, the sun,  the dawn, and the two Asvina or beams that accompany the dawn. The winds  come next. The earth is a goddess. The waters are goddesses. It is  remarkable that the stars are very little mentioned; and the moon holds  no distinguished place.    [Sidenote: Hardly any fetichism in the Rig Veda.]  In the religion of the Rig Veda we hardly see fetichism--if by fetichism  we mean the worship of small physical objects, such as stones, shells,  plants, etc., which are believed to be charged (so to speak) with  divinity, though this appears in the fourth Veda--the Atharva. But even  in the Rig Veda almost any object that is grand, beneficent, or terrible  may be adored; and implements associated with worship are themselves  worshiped. Thus, the war-chariot, the plow, the furrow, etc., are  prayed to.    [Sidenote: Early tendency toward pantheism.]  A pantheistic conception of nature was also present in the Indian mind  from very early times, although its development was later. Even in the  earliest hymns any portion of nature with which man is brought into  close relation may be adored.[6]    [Sidenote: Reverence of the dead.]  We must on no account overlook the reverence paid to the dead. The  _pitris_ (_patres_) or fathers are frequently referred to in the Veda.  They are clearly distinguished from the _devas_ or gods. In later  writings they are also distinguished from men, as having been created  separately from them; but this idea does not appear in the Veda. Yama,  the first mortal, traveled the road by which none returns, and now  drinks the Soma in the innermost of heaven, surrounded by the other  fathers. These come also, along with the gods, to the banquets prepared  for them on earth, and, sitting on the sacred grass, rejoice in the  exhilarating draught.    [Sidenote: The subjects of the hymns of the Rig Veda.]  The hymns of the Rig Veda celebrate the power, exploits, or generosity  of the deity invoked, and sometimes his personal beauty.
