Buckle, who finds in the constant consumption  of rice among the Hindoos a reason for the inclination to the  prodigious and grotesque, the depression of spirits, and the weariness  of life manifest in that nation, likewise considers that the morbid  temperament of the Arab is a sequence of vegetarianism. He points out  that rice contains an unusual amount of starch, namely, between 83 and  85 per cent; and that dates possess precisely the same nutritious  substances as rice does, with the single difference that the starch is  already converted into sugar. To live, therefore, on such food is not  to satisfy hunger; and hunger, like all other cravings, even if  partially satisfied, exercises control over the imagination. \"This  biological fact,\" says Peschel, \"was and still is the origin of the  rigid fastings prescribed by religions so widely different, which are  made use of by Shamans in every quarter of the world when they wish to  enter into communication with invisible powers.\" Peschel and Buckle,  however, are at variance as to the influence of the date diet as  affecting a race; and the former remarks that, \"while no one will deny  that the nature of the food reacts upon the mental powers of man, the  temperament evoked by different sorts is different;\" yet \"we are still  far from having ascertained anything in regard to the permanent  effects of daily food, especially as the human stomach has, to a great  degree, the power of accommodating itself to various food substances,  so that with use even narcotics lose much of their effect.\" The same  author also adds that the date \"trains up independent and warlike  desert tribes, which have not the most remote mental relationship to  the rice-eating Hindoos.\"    It remains for the reader to reconcile this disagreement of learned  doctors according to his own judgment. The evidence of those who  subsist on the date is certainly overwhelming in its favor. The  Assyrians, tradition says, asserted that it was such a great gift to  them that its worth could not be too extravagantly told; for they had  found, for the leaves, the fruit, the juices, and the wood of the  tree, three hundred and sixty different uses. The Mohammedans adopt  the date palm into their religion as an emblem of uprightness, and say  that it miraculously sprang into existence, fully grown, at the  command of the Prophet. Palm branches still enter as symbols of  rejoicing into Christian religious ceremonies; and throughout  Palestine constant reference is found to the date and the palm in the  naming of towns. Bethany means \"a house of dates.\" Ancient Palmyra was  a \"city of palms,\" and the Hebrew female name Tamar is derived from  the word in that language signifying palm. In Africa there is an  immense tract of land between Barbary and the great desert named  Bilidulgerid, \"the land of dates,\" from the profusion of the trees  there growing.    [Illustration: GATHERING DATES IN CEYLON.]    In this country, the date as an article of food is classed with the  prune, the fig, and the tamarind, to be used merely as a luxury. We  find it coming to the markets at just about this time of year in the  greatest quantities, packed in baskets roughly made from dried palm  leaves. The dates, gathered while ripe and soft, are forced into these  receptacles until almost a pasty mass, often not over clean, is  formed. Their natural sugar tends to preserve them; but after long  keeping they become dry and hard. This renders them unfit for use; but  they still find a sale to the itinerant vendors who, after steaming  them to render them soft (of course at the expense of the flavor),  hawk them about the streets. Dates in the pasty condition are not  relished by those who live on them; nor, on the other hand, would we  probably fancy the dried, almost tasteless fruit which, strung on long  straws, is carried in bunches by the Arabs in their pouches.    The date palm (_phoenix dactylifera_) is the most important species  of the dozen which make up its genus. Though slow in growth, it  shoots up a magnificent stem, to the height sometimes of eighty feet,  the summit of which is covered with a graceful crown of pinnated  leaves. The trunk is exceedingly rough and spiny; the flower spathes,  which appear in the axils of the leaves, are woody, and contain  branched spadices with many flowers; more than 11,000 have been  counted on a single male spadix. As the flowers are dioecious, it is  necessary to impregnate the female blossoms artificially in order to  insure a good crop; and to this end the male spadices are cut off when  the pollen is ripe and carefully shaken over the female ones. At from  six to ten years of age, the tree bears, and then remains fruitful for  upward of 200 years. An excellent idea of the palm in full bearing may  be obtained from our illustration, which represents the mode of  gathering the dates, of which a single tree will often yield from one  to four hundredweight in a season. The fruit varies much in size and  quality; and in the oases of the Sahara forty-six varieties have been  named.    The utilizations of the date palm and its products are very numerous.  The stem yields starch, and timber for houses, boats, fences, fuel,  etc., as well as an inferior kind of sago. The leaves serve as  parasols and umbrellas, and for material for roof covering, baskets,  brushes, mats, and innumerable utensils. At their base is a fiber,  which is spun into excellent rope. When the heart of the leaf is cut,  a thick honey-like juice exudes, which, by fermentation, becomes wine  (the \"toddy\" of India), or vinegar, and is also boiled down into  sugar. The young shoots, when cooked, resemble asparagus; and the  dates themselves are dried and ground into meal, from which bread is  prepared.           *       *       *       *       *      PANTHERS AS SEED DISTRIBUTORS.    It is well known that bees carry pollen from flower to flower, and  that eggs of marine animals are often carried long distances in the  stomachs of aquatic birds. A very curious instance of this kind,  showing how vegetable species may be diffused by means which no  botanist, however acute, would be likely to think of, is mentioned by  Mr. Alfred Smee, who states that, attached to the skin of a panther  recently shot in India, were found numerous seeds, each of which had  two perfect hooks, manifestly designed to attach themselves to foreign  bodies. As the panther moved about it collected the seeds on the skin  and carried them about wherever it went; but when it rubbed against  the shrubs, it of necessity brushed some off, and thus distributed  them. One of the seeds produced a handsome plant, and beautiful  clusters of tubular flowers. It was immediately recognized to be the  _Martynia diandra_--a plant which, although introduced into England as  far back as 1731, has scarcely ever been cultivated, although it has  been commented on by botanists and other writers.           *       *       *       *       *          FOR POSTERITY--A SUGGESTION.      The Irish gentleman who declined to aid an enterprise for the benefit  of posterity, remarking that posterity had never done anything for  him, was, after all the sport made of him, no unfair representative of  the bulk of mankind. There is talk enough about doing great things for  the advantage of future ages, but the real motive is apt to be  something very different. To perpetuate their own name or fame, men or  nations often set up lasting monuments, and sometimes unintentionally  convey thereby to after times a few more or less instructive  indications of the artistic or industrial skill of their day and  generation. To further their own immediate ends, or to secure some  benefit to their immediate descendants, men frequently undertake great  material enterprises, and sometimes the work so done remains for ages  the source of perennial good. But very rarely, if ever, can it be said  that any work of man was undertaken solely, or even chiefly, for the  benefit of posterity--more rarely still, for remote posterity.    Hence it happens that we owe far more to accident, to fire, rapine,  volcanic outbursts, and the protecting care of desolation, for the  knowledge we have of times long past, than to any intentional legacies  of art or learning left us by the men of those times. The lost and  abandoned tools, weapons, and ornaments of the stone age are all that  we have to tell us of the childhood of humanity. Had no fiery  disasters ever overtaken the pile-dwellers of the Swiss lakes, we  should probably have never heard of such a people.    To the mud and ashes of Vesuvius, rather than to the historians of the  Roman Empire, we owe the best of our knowledge of how Roman cities  looked and Roman citizens lived eighteen hundred years ago. In the  fragments of a _terra cotta_ library, buried in the ruins of a royal  palace, we find almost our only records of the arts and sciences of  ancient Assyria. Under the ash heaps of a forgotten age, in Cyprus,  Cesnola finds the only known vestiges of a primitive civilization,  reaching far back into the domain of mythology. Thanks to the  destroyers of Troy and Mycenae, and the protective care of temporary  oblivion, Schliemann is now able to verify tradition and lay before an  astonished and delighted world numerous precious relics of heroic ages  hitherto remembered only in song.    Who can estimate the value of these and similar findings to us--the  value of the revelations they bring of man's condition in those remote  ages? Who can say how many or how few the ages will be ere the time  comes when the antiquaries of the future will be rejoicing over  equally fragmentary vestiges of the doings"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19415"],[0,"Libraries in the Medieval and Renaissance Periods (#2)"],[1,"occupy themselves with manual labour, and      again, at certain hours, with holy reading....        Between Easter and the calends of October let them apply      themselves to reading from the fourth hour till near the sixth      hour. After the sixth hour, when they rise from table, let      them rest on their beds in complete silence; or, if any one      should wish to read to himself, let him do so in such a way as      not to disturb any one else....        From the calends of October to the beginning of Lent let them      apply themselves to reading until the second hour.... During      Lent, let them apply themselves to reading from morning until      the end of the third hour ... and, in these days of Lent, let      them receive a book apiece from the library, and read it      straight through. These books are to be given out at the      beginning of Lent. It is important that one or two seniors      should be appointed to go round the monastery at the hours      when brethren are engaged in reading, in case some      ill-conditioned brother should be giving himself up to sloth      or idle talk, instead of reading steadily; so that not only is      he useless to himself, but incites others to do wrong.    \"Behold! how great a matter a little fire kindleth!\" These simple words,  uttered by one who in power of far-reaching influence has had no equal,  gave an impulse to study in the ages it once was the fashion to call dark  which grew with the growth of the Order--till wherever a Benedictine house  arose--or a monastery of any one of the Orders which were but off-shoots  from the Benedictine tree--books were multiplied, and a library came into  being, small indeed at first, but increasing year by year, till the  wealthier houses had gathered together a collection of books that would do  credit to a modern University.    It is very interesting to notice, as Order after Order was founded, a  steady development of feeling with regard to books, and an ever increasing  care for their safe-keeping. S. Benedict had contented himself with  general directions for study; the Cluniacs prescribe the selection of a  special officer to take charge of the books, with an annual audit of them,  and the assignment of a single volume to each brother; the Carthusians and  the Cistercians provide for the loan of books to extraneous persons under  certain conditions--a provision which the Benedictines in their turn  adopted. Further, by the time that the Cluniac Customs were drawn up in  the form in which they have come down to us, it is evident that the number  of books exceeded the number of brethren; for both in them, and in the  statutes which Lanfranc promulgated for the use of the English  Benedictines in 1070, the keeper of the books is directed to bring all the  books of the House into Chapter, after which the brethren, one by one, are  to bring in the books they had borrowed on the same day in the previous  year. Some of the former class of books were probably service-books, but,  after this deduction has been made, we may fairly conclude that by the end  of the eleventh century Benedictine Houses possessed two sets of books:  (1) those which were distributed among the brethren; (2) those which were  kept in some safe place, probably the church, as part of the valuables of  the House: or, to adopt modern phrases, they had a lending library and a  library of reference. The Augustinians go a step farther than the  Benedictines and the Orders derived from them, for they prescribe the kind  of press in which the books are to be kept. Both they and the  Premonstratensians permit their books to be lent on the receipt of a  pledge of sufficient value. Lastly, the Friars, though they were  established on the principle of holding no possessions of any kind, soon  found that books were indispensable; that, in the words of a Norman  Bishop, _Claustrum sine armario, castrum sine armamentario_. So, by a  strange irony, it came to pass that their libraries excelled those of most  other Orders, as Richard de Bury testifies in the _Philobiblon_.        Whenever we turned aside to the cities and places where the      Mendicants had their convents ... we found heaped up amidst      the utmost poverty the utmost riches of wisdom....        These men are as ants ever preparing their meat in the summer,      and ingenious bees continually fabricating cells of honey....      And to pay due regard to truth, although they lately at the      eleventh hour have entered the Lord's vineyard ..., they have      added more in this brief hour to the stock of the sacred books      than all the other vine-dressers; following in the footsteps      of Paul, the last to be called but the first in preaching, who      spread the gospel of Christ more widely than all others.    It might have been expected, from the use of the word _library_ in the  Rule of S. Benedict, that a special room assigned to books would have been  one of the primitive component parts of every Benedictine House. This,  however, is not the case. Such a room does usually occur in these Houses,  but it will be found, on examination, that it was added to some previously  existing structure in the fourteenth or fifteenth century. Its absence  from the primitive plan brings out two points very clearly: (1) how few  books even a wealthy community could afford to possess for several  centuries after the foundation of the Order; (2) how strictly the Order  adhered to prescribed arrangements in laying out its Houses, for even  those built, or rebuilt, after books had become plentiful, do not admit a  Library as an indispensable item in their ground-plan.    How then did they bestow their books after they had become too numerous to  be kept in the church? The answer to this question is a very curious one,  when we consider what our climate is, and indeed what the climate of the  whole of Europe is, during the winter months. The centre of the monastic  life was the cloister. Brethren were not allowed to congregate in any  other part of the conventual buildings, except when they went into the  frater, or dining-hall, for their meals, or at certain hours in certain  seasons into the warming-house (_calefactorium_). In the cloister  accordingly they kept their books; and there they sat and studied, or  conducted the schooling of the novices and choir-boys in winter and in  summer alike.    Such a locality as this could not have been very favourable to the  preservation of the books themselves. They, however, had a certain amount  of protection which was denied to their readers, for they were shut up in  presses. The word used for these, _armarium_, is the same as that which  was applied by the Romans to their bookcases; and probably the idea of  such a piece of furniture was due to a far-off echo of ancient usage. The  official who had charge of the books did not derive his name from them, as  in modern times, but from the presses which contained them--for he was  uniformly styled _armarius_.    As time went on, greater comfort was introduced. The windows of the walk  of the cloister where the presses stood, usually the walk next the Church,  were glazed--and sometimes not merely with white glass, but with mottoes  alluding to the authors whose works were near at hand; while in some  monasteries the elder monks were provided with small wooden studies,  called \"carrells.\" A description of the whole system has been preserved  for us in that curious book _The Rites of Durham_; but it must be  remembered that this represents the customs of the convent just before the  suppression, and therefore gives no idea of the rigour of an earlier time.      _Part of the north walk of the cloister, Durham._          In the north syde of the Cloister, from the corner over      against the Church dour to the corner over againste the Dorter      dour, was all fynely glased from the hight to the sole within      a litle of the grownd into the Cloister garth. And in every      wyndowe iij Pewes or Carrells, where every one of the old      Monks had his carrell, severall by himselfe, that, when they      had dyned, they dyd resort to that place of Cloister, and      there studyed upon there books, every one in his carrell, all      the after nonne, unto evensong tyme. This was there exercise      every daie.        All there pewes or carrells was all fynely wainscotted and      verie close, all but the forepart, which had carved wourke      that gave light in at ther carrell doures of wainscott. And in      every carrell was a deske to lye there bookes on. And the      carrells was no greater then from one stanchell of the wyndowe      to another.        And over against the carrells against the church wall did      stande certaine great almeries [or cupbords] of waynscott all      full of bookes [with great store of ancient manuscripts to      help them in their study], wherein did lye as well the old      auncyent written Doctors of the Church as other prophane      authors with dyverse other holie mens wourks, so that every      one dyd studye what Doctor pleased them best, havinge the      Librarie at all tymes to goe studie in besydes there carrells.    No example of an English monastic book-press has survived, so far as I  have been able to discover; but it would be rash to say that none exists.  Meanwhile I will shew you a French example of a press, from the sacristy  of the Cathedral at Bayeux, but I cannot be sure that it was originally  intended to hold books. M. Viollet-Le-Duc, from whom I borrow it, decides  that it was probably made early in the thirteenth century.      _Cupboard from sacristy of Bayeux Cathedral._      The Durham _Rites_ speak only of book-presses standing in the cloister  against the walls; but it was not unusual to have recesses in the wall  itself, fitted with shelves, and probably closed by a door.
