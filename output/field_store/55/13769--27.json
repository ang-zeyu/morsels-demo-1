[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],[0,"How To Write Special Feature Articles (#2)"],[1,"the last thirty years has  resulted in a type of writing known as the \"special feature article.\"  Such articles, presenting interesting and timely subjects in popular  form, are designed to attract a class of readers that were not reached  by the older literary periodicals. Editors of newspapers and magazines a  generation ago began to realize that there was no lack of interest on  the part of the general public in scientific discoveries and inventions,  in significant political and social movements, in important persons and  events. Magazine articles on these themes, however, had usually been  written by specialists who, as a rule, did not attempt to appeal to the  \"man in the street,\" but were satisfied to reach a limited circle of  well-educated readers.    To create a larger magazine-reading public, editors undertook to develop  a popular form and style that would furnish information as attractively  as possible. The perennial appeal of fiction gave them a suggestion for  the popularization of facts. The methods of the short story, of the  drama, and even of the melodrama, applied to the presentation of general  information, provided a means for catching the attention of the casual  reader.    Daily newspapers had already discovered the advantage of giving the  day's news in a form that could be read rapidly with the maximum degree  of interest by the average man and woman. Certain so-called sensational  papers had gone a step further in these attempts to give added  attractiveness to news and had emphasized its melodramatic aspects.  Other papers had seen the value of the \"human interest\" phases of the  day's happenings. It was not surprising, therefore, that Sunday editors  of newspapers should undertake to apply to special articles the same  methods that had proved successful in the treatment of news.    The product of these efforts at popularization was the special feature  article, with its story-like form, its touches of description, its  \"human interest,\" its dramatic situations, its character portrayal--all  effectively used to furnish information and entertainment for that rapid  reader, the \"average American.\"    DEFINITION OF A SPECIAL ARTICLE. A special feature article may be  defined as a detailed presentation of facts in an interesting form  adapted to rapid reading, for the purpose of entertaining or informing  the average person. It usually deals with (1) recent news that is of  sufficient importance to warrant elaboration; (2) timely or seasonal  topics not directly connected with news; or (3) subjects of general  interest that have no immediate connection with current events.    Although frequently concerned with news, the special feature article is  more than a mere news story. It aims to supplement the bare facts of the  news report by giving more detailed information regarding the persons,  places, and circumstances that appear in the news columns. News must be  published as fast as it develops, with only enough explanatory material  to make it intelligible. The special article, written with the  perspective afforded by an interval of a few days or weeks, fills in the  bare outlines of the hurried news sketch with the life and color that  make the picture complete.    The special feature article must not be confused with the type of news  story called the \"feature,\" or \"human interest,\" story. The latter  undertakes to present minor incidents of the day's news in an  entertaining form. Like the important news story, it is published  immediately after the incident occurs. Its purpose is to appeal to  newspaper readers by bringing out the humorous and pathetic phases of  events that have little real news value. It exemplifies, therefore,  merely one distinctive form of news report.    The special feature article differs from the older type of magazine  article, not so much in subject as in form and style. The most marked  difference lies in the fact that it supplements the recognized methods  of literary and scientific exposition with the more striking devices of  narrative, descriptive, and dramatic writing.    SCOPE OF FEATURE ARTICLES. The range of subjects for special  articles is as wide as human knowledge and experience. Any theme is  suitable that can be made interesting to a considerable number of  persons. A given topic may make either a local or a general appeal. If  interest in it is likely to be limited to persons in the immediate  vicinity of the place with which the subject is connected, the article  is best adapted to publication in a local newspaper. If the theme is one  that appeals to a larger public, the article is adapted to a periodical  of general circulation. Often local material has interest for persons in  many other communities, and hence is suitable either for newspapers or  for magazines.    Some subjects have a peculiar appeal to persons engaged in a particular  occupation or devoted to a particular avocation or amusement. Special  articles on these subjects of limited appeal are adapted to  agricultural, trade, or other class publications, particularly to such  of these periodicals as present their material in a popular rather than  a technical manner.    THE NEWSPAPER FIELD. Because of their number and their local  character, daily newspapers afford a ready medium for the publication of  special articles, or \"special feature stories,\" as they are generally  called in newspaper offices. Some newspapers publish these articles from  day to day on the editorial page or in other parts of the paper. Many  more papers have magazine sections on Saturday or Sunday made up  largely of such \"stories.\" Some of these special sections closely  resemble regular magazines in form, cover, and general make-up.    The articles published in newspapers come from three sources: (1)  syndicates that furnish a number of newspapers in different cities with  special articles, illustrations, and other matter, for simultaneous  publication; (2) members of the newspaper's staff; that is, reporters,  correspondents, editors, or special writers employed for the purpose;  (3) so-called \"free-lance\" writers, professional or amateur, who submit  their \"stories\" to the editor of the magazine section.    Reporters, correspondents, and other regular members of the staff may be  assigned to write special feature stories, or may prepare such stories  on their own initiative for submission to the editor of the magazine  section. In many offices regular members of the staff are paid for  special feature stories in addition to their salaries, especially when  the subjects are not assigned to them and when the stories are prepared  in the writer's own leisure time. Other papers expect their regular  staff members to furnish the paper with whatever articles they may  write, as a part of the work covered by their salary. If a paper has one  or more special feature writers on its staff, it may pay them a fixed  salary or may employ them \"on space\"; that is, pay them at a fixed  \"space rate\" for the number of columns that an article fills when  printed.    Newspaper correspondents, who are usually paid at space rates for news  stories, may add to their monthly \"string,\" or amount of space, by  submitting special feature articles in addition to news. They may also  submit articles to other papers that do not compete with their own  paper. Ordinarily a newspaper expects a correspondent to give it the  opportunity of printing any special feature stories that he may write.    Free-lance writers, who are not regularly employed by newspapers or  magazines as staff members, submit articles for the editor's  consideration and are paid at space rates. Sometimes a free lance will  outline an article in a letter or in personal conference with an editor  in order to get his approval before writing it, but, unless the editor  knows the writer's work, he is not likely to promise to accept the  completed article. To the writer there is an obvious advantage in  knowing that the subject as he outlines it is or is not an acceptable  one. If an editor likes the work of a free lance, he may suggest  subjects for articles, or may even ask him to prepare an article on a  given subject. Freelance writers, by selling their work at space rates,  can often make more money than they would receive as regular members of  a newspaper staff.    For the amateur the newspaper offers an excellent field. First, in every  city of any size there is at least one daily newspaper, and almost all  these papers publish special feature stories. Second, feature articles  on local topics, the material for which is right at the amateur's hand,  are sought by most newspapers. Third, newspaper editors are generally  less critical of form and style than are magazine editors. With some  practice an inexperienced writer may acquire sufficient skill to prepare  an acceptable special feature story for publication in a local paper,  and even if he is paid little or nothing for it, he will gain experience  from seeing his work in print.    The space rate paid for feature articles is usually proportionate to the  size of the city in which the newspaper is published. In small cities  papers seldom pay more than $1 a column; in larger places the rate is  about $3 a column; in still larger ones, $5; and in the largest, from $8  to $10. In general the column rate for special feature stories is the  same as that paid for news stories.    WHAT NEWSPAPERS WANT. Since timeliness is the keynote of the newspaper,  current topics, either growing out of the news of the week or  anticipating coming events, furnish the subjects for most special  feature stories. The news columns from day to day provide room for only  concise announcements of such news as a scientific discovery, an  invention, the death of an interesting person, a report on social or  industrial conditions, proposed legislation, the razing of a landmark,  or the dedication of a new building.

Educated at Harrow, where he had excelled in sport and captained the  Eleven at Lord's for two succeeding years; respected by the upper Forms  and worshipped by the lower, he had developed the English side of his  dual nationality until masters and schoolfellows had come to look upon  him as one of themselves.    From Harrow he had gone to Brazenose; then had quite suddenly thrown up  the 'Varsity and returned to Egypt.    Love?    Not at all, for was not his indifference to woman supreme and sincere?    Just the inevitable ending of a very commonplace, sordid little story  which had taught the youth one of life's bitterest lessons.    One of a multitude of guests at Hurdley Castle, he had met a woman,  beautiful but predatory, whose looks were taking on an autumnal tint,  and whose banking account had shrivelled under the frost of  extravagance.    His utter indifference to her wiles and her beauty had culminated in a  degrading scene of anger on her part, when, forgetting her breeding,  her birth and her nationality, she had first of all twitted him and  then openly laughed at his mixed parentage.    He had stood without uttering a word, white to the lips during her  tirade.    \"Do you think that any white woman would marry you--a _half-caste_?\"  had cried the woman, whose bills were coming in in shoals.    \"Yes, many,\" he had quietly answered as he bent to pick up her torn,  handkerchief.  \"Am I not a rich man?\"    He had returned to Egypt upon a visit to the Flat Oasis where dwelt his  parents, who, though noting the indescribable hurt in the eyes of their  firstborn, yet asked no question, for in Egypt a youth is his own  master and ofttimes married at the age of fourteen; how much more,  therefore, is he a man at over twenty years?    He had visited his own house in the Oasis of Khargegh, with the purpose  of putting his stables in order and his falconers through a stiff  catechism, and had finally set out to see something of the world.    Not in a desire to cover his hurt, for he was as stoical as any  high-bred Arab; and, Mohammedan from belief as well as early training,  did not kick against what he looked upon as the commands of Allah.    As for women--well!  The sweet, docile woman of his father's race  interested him not at all, so that he refused to listen to any hint  anent the desirability of his taking a wife and establishing the  succession of the House 'an Mahabbha, which is the eldest branch of the  House el-Umbar; and racial distinction barred him from the virile,  lovely women of his mother's race.    He had his horses, his hawks, his hunting cheetahs, his dogs; one great  treasure which he prized and one little conceit.    The treasure had been found in the ruins of the Temple Deir-el-Bahari.  An ornament of gold set with precious stones.  Its shape was that of  the Hawk, which had stood as the symbol of the North in the glorious  days of Ancient Egypt.  The wings were of emeralds tipped with rubies;  gold were the claws and gold the Symbol of Life they held; the body and  tail were a mass of precious stones; and the eye of some jet-black  stone, unknown to the present century.    As an ornament it was of great value; as an antiquity found in the  Shrine of Anubis, the God of Death, its value could not even be guessed  at; and how it had come into the possession of Hugh Garden Ali will  never be known, though of a truth, unlimited wealth works wonders.    And upon his horses' saddle-cloths, his falcons' hoods, his hounds'  coats, and the fine linen and satins of his Eastern raiment he had the  emblem worked in thread or silk or jewels, or painted in soft colours.    It was just a pretty conceit, but in conjunction with one-half of his  lineage and his love for his birds, it had earned him the title of \"The  Hawk of Egypt.\"    And such was the man as he stood in the market-place, having followed  the path which Fate had marked out for him through the twisting lanes  of the bazaar.          CHAPTER II      \"_Dog, ounce, bear and bull,    Wolf, lion, horse_.\"            DU BARTAS.      Damaris should not have been strolling by herself in the native quarter.    If you are drab or flat of chest or soul or face, you can saunter your  fill in any bazaar without adventure befalling you; if, however, nature  should have endowed you with the colouring of a desert sunset, if, in  short, you _can_ add a splash of colour to anything so colourful as a  native bazaar, then 'twere wise to do your sauntering under the wing of  a vigilant chaperon, so that the curiosity and interest resultant on  your splash may reach you obliquely and \"as through a glass, darkly.\"    But there was no one to worry the girl at this hour before sunset, so  that little by little and quite unconsciously she moved forward until  she stood outside the doorway.    She stood, outlined against a background of blazing colours, which  served in no way to dim her beauty.  Through the yellow-white arch of  the doorway showed a stretch of turquoise-blue sky across which, upon a  string, swung golden onions and scarlet peppercorns, whilst underneath  ruminated a fine, superbly indifferent dromedary.    For a moment Hugh Carden Ali, jogged by Fate, looked straight across at  the beautiful picture, staying his talk with Abdul, who, with the  courtesy of the East, did not turn his head as he stroked the breast  and head of the _shahin_ on his fist.    But Damaris, with envy rampant in her heart, had no eyes for mere man;  she wanted to walk across and get near the coal-black stallion from  Unayza, a district famous for its breed of large, heavy-built horses.  He stood impatiently, with an occasional plunk of a hoof on the sandy  stones, or nuzzled his master's sleeve, or pulled at it with his teeth,  whilst two shaggy dogs of Billi lay stretched out awaiting the signal  to be up and going, perhaps, in a sprint across the desert after the  _hosseny_ or red rascal of a fox which had been trapped and caged for  the sole purpose of hunting.    Ride out with the caged _hosseny_ on a thoroughbred camel or  thoroughbred horse, take with you a couple of greyhounds and a dog or  so from Billi, get right off the tourist track and let the red rascal  out, and see if you don't have some fun before breakfast.    Only get off the tourist track, else you will have all the bazaar  camels and ponies loping along behind you.    The only wild beast this afternoon for sale was a jaguar, black as ink,  smooth as satin, short, heavy, with half-closed green eyes fixed  steadfastly upon a plump white pigeon foolishly strutting just out of  reach of the steel-pointed claws.    \"Take her upon thy fist, O Master,\" said Abdul of Shammar, as he  lengthened the jesses, the short, narrow straps of leather or woven  silk or cotton with which to hold the hawk.  \"See, she is well  reclaimed, being tame and gentle and altogether amiable.  When thrown,  she is as a bullet from a rifle, binding her quarry in high air even as  a man holds his woman to his heart upon the roof-top under the stars.  She is full summed\"--and he ran his slender fingers through the new  feathers, full and soft after moulting; \"she is keen as the winter  wind--behold the worn and blunted nails; she will not give up, my  master, yet will she come to the lure as quickly, as joyfully as a maid  to her lover.\"    Hugh Carden Ali, the greatest authority after Abdul on the _shahin_,  took the bird upon his fist, looked at the sunken, piercing eyes which  were partially seeled; ran his hand over the narrow body, short tail  and black back, and a finger over the large beak and deep mouth; held  up the ugly face to the light, examined the flight-feathers and, moving  his hand quickly up and down, caused the bird to flutter its wings--and  so give him a chance of measuring the distance of the wings from the  body.  Finding her altogether lovely, he nodded and handed her back to  the delighted falconer of Shammar, just as with a decisive pat the  jaguar landed, its huge paw upon the strutting pigeon, which had  forgotten to keep its distance.    For a moment the attention of the spectators, who were mostly squatting  on their heels, was diverted from the master and the falconer.  They  laughed, they moved, whilst some in the back row stood up to see the  fun, leaving for one second an open space through which Damaris could  see the fluttering white bird.    \"Ah!\" she cried, heartbroken at the sight; then, \"Fetch!\" she commanded  the dog, pointing across the square.    Now, the dog, who had dispensed with his spiked collar on account of  the heat, had no more idea than the man in the moon what he had to  fetch for his beloved mistress; but, restless from prolonged inactivity  and the smell of strange beasts, he hurled himself in the direction  pointed; and his speed, once he got going, was as surprising as that of  the elephant or rhinoceros and other clumsy-looking animals, and in  very truth, his appearance was just as terrifying.    He crashed head-foremost into the back row of spectators, which, as one  man, yelled and fled; tore along the path made clear for him, and  sensing an enemy in the growling jaguar, was at its throat like a  thrown spear; missing it by an inch as the black beast flung itself  back to the full length of the steel chain which fastened it to an iron  ring in the ground.    Damaris in her turn rushed, across the square, passing the astounded  spectators, who salaamed as she ran.  And as she ran she shouted:    \"Let the animal loose,\" she cried.  \"Give it a chance; let it loose.\"    But Hugh Carden Ali, not in the least understanding the sudden  onslaught, but with every sporting instinct uppermost, had already  leant down in the seething, growling mass of fur and hate, and loosened  the chain; whilst, with screams of fear and delight, the crowd raced  for the adjacent "]]]
