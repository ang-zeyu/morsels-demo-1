[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17615"],[0,"In Search of the Okapi (#2)"],[1," two friends who had just left school  entered a room which was part library, part museum, armoury, dining-  room, and cabin, so crammed it was.    \"This is my friend Venning, Mr. Hume.\"    \"Glad to see you, Venning. Sit down anywhere.\"    Compton sat down between the horns of a bleached buffalo skull, but  Venning stood like one in a trance. His hand had been swallowed up  by a huge palm and thick iron-like fingers, and he was staring down  on a pair of the broadest shoulders he had seen, with an arching  chest to match. This was the pigmy he had imagined--this man with  the shoulders of a giant and the chest of a Hercules. Then his eyes  ranged over the walls, gradually recovering their animation.    \"Know 'em,\" said Mr. Hume, waving a bronzed hand towards the wall.    \"I think so, sir.\"    \"Just reel off the names.\"    Venning reeled off the names of a score or more of animals without  hesitation, and Mr. Hume looked pleased.    \"There are some men,\" he said, \"who come in here and talk over me  and round me and under me about fur and feather, and they can't tell  a bighorn from a koodoo by the horns on the wall. Now, my friend,  you knew those over there in the corner were the horns of a koodoo,  but do you know his habits?\"    \"No, sir; but I spent a month watching a Dartmoor deer.\"    \"A month! Can't learn anything in a month, boy; but you've struck  the right book. The pages that are spread out under the sky hold the  right teaching, for those who wish to learn about animals. There are  writers who make a study of structure; they argue from bones, and  classify; but bones don't tell us about the living flesh and blood.  You take my meaning?\"    \"You make a difference between the structure of animals and their  habits.\"    \"That's so, my lad. Ever read Jeffreys, and the sketches by the 'Son  of the Marshes'?\"    \"They're splendid.\"    Mr. Hume nodded and filled a pipe, having a footlong stem, made out  of the wing-bone of an albatross.    \"I want to describe the personal habits of animals in their  surroundings. I said 'personal' habits. Do you take me?\"    \"No, sir.\"    \"You think I should use another word, and say, perhaps,  'distinctive' habits. I say personal. Now, you take a lion--a bush  lion or a veld lion, a yellow lion or a black lion, young or old.  That lion, whichever one you take, is a lion by himself. He's got  his own character and his own experience. All lions have ways in  common because they're built alike. They're heavy and muscular  because they've got to pull down big game; and because they're heavy  they move slowly, and because they move slowly they've got to adopt  common tactics in hunting. Good; but one lion differs from another,  and so with other animals, right away through the list. So, I say,  one must study the personal habits of animals in their own back  yard, so to say, before he can give a true description of them. Do  you take my meaning?\"    \"I should like nothing better than to study animals in their home,\"  said the boy, burning with excitement.    \"And the two of you think you would like to join me in my  expedition?\"    Mr. Hume looked at them out of calm yellowish eyes as if he were  studying them.    \"We should,\" they said eagerly.    \"Think it will turn out a picnic--a glorified sort of camping-out,  with black fellows to wait on you, and a lot of shooting and  fishing? Is that your idea?\"    \"We were talking about that this morning,\" said Compton, \"and we  came to the conclusion that exploring was hard work. We are prepared  for rough living.\"    \"That's right. And you tell me that you are free to go without  giving anxiety to relatives, eh?\"    \"We neither of us have near relatives.\"    Mr. Hume stood up and felt each one over in turn, making them draw  deep breaths.    \"Seem sound,\" he mused, \"in wind and limb. But there is one thing.  The great danger in Central Africa is from fever--not from animals  or blacks.\" Here he took down a bottle of white powder, and placed a  large pinch in a wine-glass of water.  \"Quinine is the traveler's  stand-by, but there are some who cannot take quinine, It has no  effect on them, and such people have no business to set foot in  fever districts. Drink this?\"    Compton emptied the glass with a wry face, and Venning, when his  turn came, shuddered; but they got the dose down, and smiled.    \"Now,\" said Mr. Hume, \"you both of you give me references to the  headmaster of your school, and I will give you one in return. I will  make inquiries about you, and I would advise you to make inquiries  about me. You can come back here to-morrow afternoon, and if we are  mutually satisfied, we will then fix up a contract.\"    \"I don't think we require a reference,\" said Venning.    \"Why not?\" said Mr. Hume, sharply.    \"Because,\" blurted out Venning, turning red--\"because you have lived  among animals.\"    Mr. Hume laughed heartily with a deep rumbling laugh.    \"Animals are tricky, boy; and yet,\" he added, \"there may be a  meaning in what you say. They have a dignity in death that is grand.  Go and make your inquiries, lads. I am Dave Hume, the hunter, and my  life has been passed in wild lands, but there are some in London who  know me.\"    He rose up to open the door, and Venning overtopped him by inches,  yet he did not look either small or unwieldy. His step was springy,  and his head, poised on a massive neck, was well set, with the chin  raised. He was a man, evidently, who had always looked the world  straight in the face. His eyes had a yellowish tinge, and in their  colour and their calm they reminded Venning somehow of a lion, an  impression heightened by the tawny hue of a long beard.    The next day, the references having been satisfactorily followed up,  the contract was entered upon, and the two boys paid over the sum of  Pounds 50 each to David Hume, who in his turn agreed to let them  share in any profits which the expedition might make, from any  source whatever.    \"Profits, Mr. Hume?\" they asked.    \"Profits from hunting, from trading, or from discovery. I don't say  that we shall make anything. The chances are, of course, that we may  lose all before we are a month out, but it is always well to be  business-like. There is gold in Central Africa. We may discover a  gold reef. There are new animals in the forest. We may catch an  okapi, and if we could land it in England it would fetch a large  sum. We might snare a live gorilla, and there is not a gorilla in  the zoological gardens of Europe.\"    \"A gorilla!\" said Venning, thinking of a picture he had seen of an  erect man-ape bending a rifle-barrel into an arch as if it were a  cane.    \"A gorilla!\" said Compton. \"I should like to find the Garden of  Rest.\"    \"You have heard his story, Mr. Venning?\" said the hunter, nodding  his head at Compton.    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Well, it was because of that story that I have taken you two into  my expedition; otherwise I should have been obliged to decline your  services on account of your youth. But the story interested me, and  I will do my best to help Compton in his search.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Compton, quietly.    \"The Garden of Rest!\" mused the hunter. \"That, I take it, would be  an Arabian phrase; for such a term would not occur to a native, who  is too often idle to  attach much value to a state of rest. It  sounds peaceful;  but I have it in my mind that if we ever reach the  place,  it will be only after much hard work, much suffering, and  danger. You understand that this is no pleasure excursion?\"    \"We do, sir,\" said Compton; \"yet we expect to get much pleasure from  the expedition.\"    \"Another word. I am not an exacting man; but there is one thing I  will not tolerate, and that is disobedience. It is well to  understand that now;\" and there came a stern expression into those  singular eyes.    \"That is only right,\" said Compton; and Venning agreed.        CHAPTER II    A NOVEL CRAFT    A month was devoted to preparation--a month that was full of  pleasure to the two friends, for they came into close touch with  Dave Hume the hunter, and learnt to regard him almost as a brother.  Ordinarily, he was curt in his speech and cold in manner, especially  with strangers; but at night, when he had shed his boots and coat,  he would talk to them freely of his hunting experiences, and listen  with interest to their opinions. He never laughed at their mistakes,  nor damped their enthusiasm, but he got the best out of them by a  fine courtesy that seemed part of his nature.    Thus it was that when, early in the first week, Venning said he had  an idea for a boat that could be easily carried round the cataracts  and worked without much labour, he was at once encouraged to give  plans and specifications.    \"I read once about a 'sneak-box'--a flat-bottomed shooting canoe--  that could carry a sail and serve at the same time as a cabin.\"    \"I have used one myself duck-shooting. Go on.\"    \"Well, sir, I built a boat on the plan given, and spent a holiday  one year on the Broads. It drew very little water, and was easily  managed. However, you know all that. But what I was thinking about  was a design for a larger boat of the kind, with a propeller  attached to it which could be worked by lever.\"    \"By a lever?\"    \"Perhaps you have seen a lame man working a bicycle by a lever--  well, after that principle. There would be a steel rod with cog-  wheels, and one man could work the lever as the lame cyclist does  without the labour of  rowing.\" Venning waited nervously for the  criticism.    \"At any rate the lever would be a relief after the paddles,\" said  Mr. Hume, gravely.    \"But that is not all,\" continued the inventor, hastily. \"I would rig  up a light American windmill amidships, which could work the screw  and get more speed with a following wind in conjunction with a sail  rigged up forward.\"    \"Bravo, my boy!\" said Mr. Hume, laughing. \"How many revolutions of  the screw to the minute do you expect to get out of your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17636"],[0,"The Mystery at Putnam Hall: The School Chums' Strange Discovery (#2)"],[1," Ritter and Nick Paxton  had been left, he scrambled out again, and his place was taken by Fred  Century, another student.    \"Hello, Peleg, old sport!\" cried Pepper, gaily, to the driver of the  turnout. \"How have you been for the past fifty years?\"    \"Oh, I'm very well, thank you,\" responded Peleg Snuggers.    \"Heard you had a fortune left to you,\" went on Pepper, with a wink at  his chums. \"Old uncle died and left you half a million.\"    \"Three-quarters of a million,\" put in Andy Snow, scenting fun. \"All in  gold, too.\"    \"Isn't that fine!\" said Jack. \"Peleg, how about lending me ten or  fifteen dollars?\"    \"I could use a five-spot myself,\" added Dale.    \"I'd like to borrow about fifty for a new bicycle,\" came from Fred  Century.    \"Don't be modest about lending us the cash,\" went on Pepper. \"Just hand  it out as if you had always had it.\"    \"I ain't had no fortune left to me!\" burst out the general utility man,  desperately. \"Who said I had?\"    \"Why, everybody knows it, Peleg,\" responded Pepper. \"Come, don't be  modest about it. Was it really three-quarters of a million?\"    \"Maybe it was more,\" suggested Jack.    \"If I were you, Peleg, I'd not carry so much around in my pockets,\" said  Dale.    \"I ain't had a cent left to me!\" shouted the driver of the carryall.  \"This is some of your jokes, an' I want you to stop it! Oh, dear, now  the school's opened ag'in I suppose there won't be no rest fer nobuddy!\"  And he heaved a mountainous sigh.    \"Oh, Peleg! Don't be angry with me!\" murmured Pepper, with a trace of  tears in his voice. \"If you get angry I'll die!\"    \"You behave yourself, Pepper Ditmore, or I won't drive you to the Hall.\"    \"Peleg, don't you want me to drive?\" asked Andy, who was on the front  seat. \"I'm a cracker-jack at driving.\"    \"Not much! Don't you tech them hosses!\" shouted the general utility man  in alarm. \"That off hoss is a new one an' he's mighty skittish, I can  tell you. This mornin' when I was hookin' him up he nigh kicked the leg  off o' me!\"    \"Say, how are we going to get to the Hall?\" came in ugly tones from Reff  Ritter. He, with six other boys, was standing beside the carryall.    \"Captain Putnam said he'd send down some carriages,\" answered Peleg  Snuggers. \"There they come now,\" and he pointed to the turnouts.    \"Pshaw! I wanted to go in the carryall,\" grumbled Ritter.    \"So did I,\" added Gus Coulter.    \"Well, this is full, so you'll have to take the carriages,\" answered  Peleg Snuggers. \"Everybody hold fast!\" he shouted, as he took up the  reins.    \"We are off!\" shouted Pepper, gaily. \"Farewell to Cedarville and ho! for  Putnam Hall!\"    \"Wish I had room, I'd turn a handspring for you,\" came from Andy, who  was quite an acrobat.    \"Now don't you cut up any monkey-shines,\" pleaded the driver of the  carryall. \"That new hoss won't stand for 'em.\"    \"All right, Peleg, I'll keep as quiet as a lamb without a tail.\"    \"Why is a lamb without a tail quiet?\" asked Fred Century, quickly.    \"Give it up, Fred. Why?\"    \"Because he has no tale to tell.\"    \"Wow!\"    \"What a joke!\"    \"Throw him out!\"    \"Give him some cotton to eat!\"    \"Say, do keep quiet!\" pleaded Peleg Snuggers, as the boys in the  carryall commenced to push Fred from one seat to another. \"Want these  hosses to ran away with you?\"    \"Better draw it mild,\" suggested Major Jack. \"We don't want any accident  on the way to the Hall.\" He looked back at the crowd left on the dock.  \"Has anybody seen Bert Field?\" he asked.    \"Yes, I saw him last week,\" answered a student named Paul Singleton.  \"He'll be here to-morrow.\"    \"How about Emerald?\" asked Pepper.    \"Coming to-night,\" answered Andy. \"He went to Ireland this summer, and  his brogue is worse than ever.\"    \"Never mind, Emerald is a good fellow,\" said Major Jack. \"His heart is  as big as a barrel.\"    \"Say, but wasn't Reff Ritter mad!\" came from Dale.    \"Oh, he makes me tired,\" answered Pepper. \"After all that happened last  term wouldn't you think he'd behave himself better?\"    \"It isn't in him to behave himself,\" answered Fred Century. \"He is a  bully and always will be.\"    \"Well, he has got to keep his distance this term,\" said Major Jack, with  a firm look on his face. \"I am not going to stand for what I have in the  past.\"    \"Nor I,\" added Pepper. \"If he doesn't keep his distance he'll suffer for  it.\"    The carryall was now leaving the little village of Cedarville. Soon it  came out on a country road that ran in the direction of Putnam Hall.    It was an ideal day in early September, and the cadets returning to the  school were in high spirits. One started to sing and the others joined  in.    \"Hello, there goes the Pornell Academy stage!\" cried Pepper, presently.    \"And there are some fellows we know!\" returned Jack, as the turnout  belonging to a rival school came closer. \"Roy Bock and Bat Sedley.\"    \"I'll bet they are sore over what happened last June,\" cried Pepper.    \"It was their own fault that they suffered,\" came from Andy.    \"Look out!\" sang out Dale, and dodged down in the carryall.    Spat! A half-decayed apple struck the side of the turnout. Spat! came  one through the open window. Then the skin of a banana followed, landing  in Jack's lap.    \"Stop that, Bock!\"    \"Don't throw things in here, Sedley!\"    \"Something to remember us by!\" shouted Roy Bock, the bully of Pornell  Academy, and he threw another soft apple into the carryall. It landed on  Pepper's arm, leaving quite a mess there.    \"All right, if that's your game!\" cried Pepper, and feeling in his  pocket he brought forth an orange he had purchased on the boat. Taking  careful aim, he let fly with all force. The orange landed fairly and  squarely on Roy Bock's nose.    \"Ouch!\" roared Roy Bock, and clapped his hand to his nose, which began  to bleed.    \"Here's something for you, Sedley!\" cried Andy, and sent a handful of  peanut shells into the Pornell student's face.    \"I'll fix you fellows!\" roared Roy Bock in a rage, and catching up a  heavy book that was on the seat beside him he started to throw the  volume at Jack and Pepper.    But the volume slipped and went sailing in the air in another direction,  catching poor Peleg Snuggers on the cheek. The driver of the carryall  was so startled that he let go the reins and fell from his seat into the  dust of the road.    As the reins dropped at their heels, one of the horses--the new  one--threw up his head in sudden fright. Then he made a mad lunge  forward, dragging his mate with him. The carryall gave a lurch and a  bound that sent the occupants flying into each other's laps.    \"Stop the team!\" was the cry.    \"The horses are running away!\"          CHAPTER II    THE CADETS OF PUTNAM HALL      It was true, the team was running away. One of the horses was a spirited  animal and he now had the bit in his teeth. The boys in the rear of the  turnout looked back, to see Peleg Snuggers still lying in the highway.  The stage belonging to Pornell Academy had turned down a side road.    \"Can't you stop them, Andy?\" asked Jack Ruddy.    \"I don't see how,\" was the answer from the youth on the front seat. \"I  can't get hold of the lines.\"    \"We must stop 'em somehow!\" cried Fred Century. \"Otherwise we'll have a  smash-up, sure!\"    \"Whoa! whoa!\" yelled half a dozen, but these cries only served to scare  the team more, and away they shot along the country road, sending the  carryall swaying from side to side.    \"Look! look!\" yelled Andy, suddenly. \"The regular road is shut off! They  are repairing it!\"    The boys gazed ahead and saw that some wooden horses and planking had  been placed across the highway. This side of the barrier some bars had  been taken from a fence, so that those using the road might drive  around, through an orchard belonging to a farmer named Darrison.    \"We are going to strike those planks!\" cried Dale Blackmore.    \"Maybe the team will try to jump them!\" came from Fred.    \"If they do, they'll smash the carryall sure!\" answered Pepper. \"Perhaps  we had better drop out at the rear.\"    \"Look out!\" sang out somebody, and just then the carryall left the  highway and turned into the orchard. Then came a scraping, as the top of  the turnout hit the low-hanging branches of some apple trees.    \"Whoa! stop that wagon!\" yelled a man's voice, and Amos Darrison  appeared from among the trees. He made a leap for the team, but they  swerved to one side. Then came a crash, as one of the wheels caught in a  stump. Over went the carryall, with the boys in it. Andy, quick to act,  used his acrobatic abilities by leaping into the branches of a nearby  tree. Then the farmer caught the team and stopped them.    \"Anybody hurt?\" was Pepper's question, as he crawled out of the wreck.    \"I'm all right,\" answered Fred.    \"I got a twisted ankle, that's all,\" came from Dale, as he limped out.    \"Look at Jack!\" cried several. \"He's hurt!\"    All looked and saw the young major of the school battalion lying flat on  his back in the front of the carryall. He had a nasty cut on the temple  and his eyes were closed.    \"He is dead!\" murmured Pepper, hoarsely.    \"Oh, don't say that!\" said Andy, in sudden terror. He had just dropped  to the ground.    \"If he ain't dead he's putty badly hurted,\" said the farmer who owned  the orchard.    Pepper caught his chum in his arms and brought him out and laid him on  the grass.    \"He is still breathing!\" he cried. \"Get some water and we'll bathe his  face. Maybe that will bring him around.\"    \"I'll get the water!\" exclaimed Dale, and ran towards a well located at  the side of the orchard.    To those who have read the other volumes in this \"Putnam Hall Series,\"  the lads already mentioned will need no special introduction. For the  benefit of others, let me state that Jack Ruddy and Pepper Ditmore were  close chums, living, when at home, in the western part of New York  State. Jack was slightly the older of the two and was of rather a  serious turn of mind. Pepper was full "]]]
