Allah is able to do all things.    S: The lightning almost takes away their sight; whenever it shines on  them they walk in it, and when it becomes dark to them they stand  still; and if Allah had pleased He would certainly have taken away  their hearing and their sight; surely Allah has power over all things.    002.021  Y: O ye people! Adore your Guardian-Lord, who created you and those who  came before you, that ye may have the chance to learn righteousness;    P: O mankind! worship your Lord, Who hath created you and those before  you, so that ye may ward off (evil).    S: O men! serve your Lord Who created you and those before you so that  you may guard (against evil).    002.022  Y: Who has made the earth your couch, and the heavens your canopy; and  sent down rain from the heavens; and brought forth therewith Fruits for  your sustenance; then set not up rivals unto Allah when ye know (the  truth).    P: Who hath appointed the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky a  canopy; and causeth water to pour down from the sky, thereby producing  fruits as food for you. And do not set up rivals to Allah when ye know  (better).    S: Who made the earth a resting place for you and the heaven a canopy  and (Who) sends down rain from the cloud then brings forth with it  subsistence for you of the fruits; therefore do not set up rivals to  Allah while you know.    002.023  Y: And if ye are in doubt as to what We have revealed from time to time  to Our servant, then produce a Sura like thereunto; and call your  witnesses or helpers (If there are any) besides Allah, if your (doubts)  are true.    P: And if ye are in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto Our slave  (Muhammad), then produce a surah of the like thereof, and call your  witness beside Allah if ye are truthful.    S: And if you are in doubt as to that which We have revealed to Our  servant, then produce a Chapter like it and call on your witnesses  besides Allah if you are truthful.    002.024  Y: But if ye cannot- and of a surety ye cannot- then fear the Fire whose  fuel is men and stones,- which is prepared for those who reject Faith.    P: And if ye do it not- and ye can never do it - then guard yourselves  against the Fire prepared for disbelievers, whose fuel is of men and  stones.    S: But if you do (it) not and never shall you do (it), then be on your  guard against the fire of which men and stones are the fuel; it is  prepared for the unbelievers.    002.025  Y: But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness,  that their portion is Gardens, beneath which rivers flow. Every time  they are fed with fruits therefrom, they say: \"Why, this is what we  were fed with before,\" for they are given things in similitude; and  they have therein companions pure (and holy); and they abide therein  (for ever).    P: And give glad tidings (O Muhammad) unto those who believe and do good  works; that theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow; as often  as they are regaled with food of the fruit thereof, they say: this is  what was given us aforetime; and it is given to them in resemblance.  There for them are pure companions; there forever they abide.    S: And convey good news to those who believe and do good deeds, that  they shall have gardens in which rivers flow; whenever they shall be  given a portion of the fruit thereof, they shall say: This is what was  given to us before; and they shall be given the like of it, and they  shall have pure mates in them, and in them, they shall abide.    002.026  Y: Allah disdains not to use the similitude of things, lowest as well as  highest. Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; but  those who reject Faith say: \"What means Allah by this similitude?\" By  it He causes many to stray, and many He leads into the right path; but  He causes not to stray, except those who forsake (the path),-    P: Lo! Allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude even of a gnat. Those  who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord; but those who  disbelieve say: What doth Allah wish (to teach) by such a similitude?  He misleadeth many thereby, and He guideth many thereby; and He  misleadeth thereby only miscreants;    S: Surely Allah is not ashamed to set forth any parable-- (that of) a  gnat or any thing above that; then as for those who believe, they know  that it is the truth from their Lord, and as for those who disbelieve,  they say: What is it that Allah means by this parable: He causes many  to err by it and many He leads aright by it! but He does not cause to  err by it (any) except the transgressors,    002.027  Y: Those who break Allah's Covenant after it is ratified, and who sunder  what Allah has ordered to be joined, and do mischief on earth: These  cause loss (only) to themselves.    P: Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever  that which Allah ordered to be joined, and (who) make mischief in the  earth: Those are they who are the losers.    S: Who break the covenant of Allah after its confirmation and cut  asunder what Allah has ordered to be joined, and make mischief in the  land; these it is that are the losers.    002.028  Y: How can ye reject the faith in Allah?- seeing that ye were without  life, and He gave you life; then will He cause you to die, and will  again bring you to life; and again to Him will ye return.    P: How disbelieve ye in Allah when ye were dead and He gave life to you!  Then He will give you death, then life again, and then unto Him ye will  return.    S: How do you deny Allah and you were dead and He gave you life? Again  He will cause you to die and again bring you to life, then you shall be  brought back to Him.    002.029  Y: It is He Who hath created for you all things that are on earth;  Moreover His design comprehended the heavens, for He gave order and  perfection to the seven firmaments; and of all things He hath perfect  knowledge.    P: He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth. Then turned He  to the heaven, and fashioned it as seven heavens. And He is knower of  all things.    S: He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth, and He  directed Himself to the heaven, so He made them complete seven heavens,  and He knows all things.    002.030  Y: Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: \"I will create a vicegerent on  earth.\" They said: \"Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief  therein and shed blood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify  Thy holy (name)?\" He said: \"I know what ye know not.\"    P: And when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am about to place a  viceroy in the earth, they said: Wilt thou place therein one who will  do harm therein and will shed blood, while we, we hymn Thy praise and  sanctify Thee? He said: Surely I know that which ye know not.    S: And when your Lord said to the angels, I am going to place in the  earth a khalif, they said: What! wilt Thou place in it such as shall  make mischief in it and shed blood, and we celebrate Thy praise and  extol Thy holiness? He said: Surely I know what you do not know.    002.031  Y: And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them  before the angels, and said: \"Tell me the names of these if ye are  right.\"    P: And He taught Adam all the names, then showed them to the angels,  saying: Inform Me of the names of these, if ye are truthful.    S: And He taught Adam all the names, then presented them to the angels;  then He said: Tell me the names of those if you are right.    002.032  Y: They said: \"Glory to Thee, of knowledge We have none, save what Thou  Hast taught us: In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and  wisdom.\"    P: They said: Be glorified! We have no knowledge saving that which Thou  hast taught us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower, the Wise.    S: They said: Glory be to Thee! we have no knowledge but that which Thou  hast taught us; surely Thou art the Knowing, the Wise.    002.033  Y: He said: \"O Adam! Tell them their names.\" When he had told them,  Allah said: \"Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and  earth, and I know what ye reveal and what ye conceal?\"    P: He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names, and when he had informed  them of their names, He said: Did I not tell you that I know the secret  of the heavens and the earth? And I know that which ye disclose and  which ye hide.    S: He said: O Adam! inform them of their names. Then when he had  informed them of their names, He said: Did I not say to you that I  surely know what is ghaib in the heavens and the earth and (that) I  know what you manifest and what you hide?    002.034  Y: And behold, We said to the angels: \"Bow down to Adam\" and they bowed  down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who  reject Faith.    P: And when We said unto the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam,  they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He demurred through pride, and so  became a disbeliever.    S: And when We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam they did  obeisance, but Iblis (did it not). He refused and he was proud, and he  was one of the unbelievers.    002.035  Y: We said: \"O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of  the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach  not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression.\"    P: And We said: O Adam! Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat  ye freely (of the fruits) thereof where ye will; but come not nigh this  tree lest ye become wrong-doers.    S: And We said: O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the garden and eat  from it a plenteous (food) wherever you wish and do not approach this  tree, for then you will be of the unjust.    002.036  Y: Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of  the state (of felicity) in which they had been.

Indeed, we believe it would  have been worth Snip and Co.'s while to have let him have them for nothing.  They were easy without being tight, or rather they looked tight without  being so; there wasn't a bag, a wrinkle, or a crease that there shouldn't  be, and strong and storm-defying as they seemed, they were yet as soft and  as supple as a lady's glove. They looked more as if his legs had been blown  in them than as if such irreproachable garments were the work of man's  hands. Many were the nudges, and many the 'look at this chap's trousers,'  that were given by ambitious men emulous of his appearance as he passed  along, and many were the turnings round to examine their faultless fall  upon his radiant boot. The boots, perhaps, might come in for a little of  the glory, for they were beautifully soft and cool-looking to the foot,  easy without being loose, and he preserved the lustre of their polish, even  up to the last moment of his walk. There never was a better man for getting  through dirt, either on foot or horseback, than our friend.    To the frequenters of the 'corner,' it were almost superfluous to mention  that he is a constant attendant. He has several volumes of 'catalogues,'  with the prices the horses have brought set down in the margins, and has a  rare knack at recognizing old friends, altered, disguised, or disfigured as  they may be--'I've seen that rip before,' he will say, with a knowing shake  of the head, as some woe-begone devil goes, best leg foremost, up to the  hammer, or, 'What! is that old beast back? why he's here every day.' No man  can impose upon Soapy with a horse. He can detect the rough-coated  plausibilities of the straw-yard, equally with the metamorphosis of the  clipper or singer. His practised eye is not to be imposed upon either by  the blandishments of the bang-tail, or the bereavements of the dock.  Tattersall will hail him from his rostrum with--'Here's a horse will suit  you, Mr. Sponge! cheap, good, and handsome! come and buy him.' But it is  needless describing him here, for every out-of-place groom and  dog-stealer's man knows him by sight.          CHAPTER II    MR. BENJAMIN BUCKRAM      Having dressed and sufficiently described our hero to enable our readers to  form a general idea of the man, we have now to request them to return to  the day of our introduction. Mr. Sponge had gone along Oxford Street at a  somewhat improved pace to his usual wont--had paused for a shorter period  in the ''bus' perplexed 'Circus,' and pulled up seldomer than usual between  the Circus and the limits of his stroll. Behold him now at the Edgeware  Road end, eyeing the 'buses with a wanting-a-ride like air, instead of the  contemptuous sneer he generally adopts towards those uncouth productions.  Red, greenn, blue, drab, cinnamon-colour, passed and crossed, and jostled,  and stopped, and blocked, and the cads telegraphed, and winked, and nodded,  and smiled, and slanged, but Mr. Sponge regarded them not. He had a sort of  ''bus' panorama in his head, knew the run of them all, whence they started,  where they stopped, where they watered, where they changed, and, wonderful  to relate, had never been entrapped into a sixpenny fare when he meant to  take a threepenny one. In cab and ''bus' geography there is not a more  learned man in London.    Mark him as he stands at the corner. He sees what he wants, it's the  chequered one with the red and blue wheels that the Bayswater ones have got  between them, and that the St. John's Wood and two Western Railway ones are  trying to get into trouble by crossing. What a row! how the ruffians whip,  and stamp, and storm, and all but pick each other's horses' teeth with  their poles, how the cads gesticulate, and the passengers imprecate! now  the bonnets are out of the windows, and the row increases. Six coachmen  cutting and storming, six cads sawing the air, sixteen ladies in flowers  screaming, six-and-twenty sturdy passengers swearing they will 'fine them  all,' and Mr. Sponge is the only cool person in the scene. He doesn't rush  into the throng and 'jump in,' for fear the 'bus should extricate itself  and drive on without him; he doesn't make confusion worse confounded by  intimating his behest; he doesn't soil his bright boots by stepping off the  kerb-stone; but, quietly waiting the evaporation of the steam, and the  disentanglement of the vehicles, by the smallest possible sign in the  world, given at the opportune moment, and a steady adhesion to the flags,  the 'bus is obliged either to 'come to,' or lose the fare, and he steps  quietly in, and squeezes along to the far end, as though intent on going  the whole hog of the journey.    Away they rumble up the Edgeware Road; the gradual emergence from the brick  and mortar of London being marked as well by the telling out of passengers  as by the increasing distances between the houses. First, it is all close  huddle with both. Austere iron railings guard the subterranean kitchen  areas, and austere looks indicate a desire on the part of the passengers to  guard their own pockets; gradually little gardens usurp the places of the  cramped areas, and, with their humanizing appearance, softer looks assume  the place of frowning _anti_ swell-mob ones.    Presently a glimpse of green country or of distant hills may be caught  between the wider spaces of the houses, and frequent settings down increase  the space between the passengers; gradually conservatories appear and  conversation strikes up; then come the exclusiveness of villas, some  detached and others running out at last into real pure green fields studded  with trees and picturesque pot-houses, before one of which latter a sudden  wheel round and a jerk announces the journey done. The last passenger (if  there is one) is then unceremoniously turned loose upon the country.    Our readers will have the kindness to suppose our hero, Mr. Sponge, shot  out of an omnibus at the sign of the Cat and Compasses, in the full  rurality of grass country, sprinkled with fallows and turnip-fields. We  should state that this unwonted journey was a desire to pay a visit to Mr.  Benjamin Buckram, the horse-dealer's farm at Scampley, distant some mile  and a half from where he was set down, a space that he now purposed  travelling on foot.    Mr. Benjamin Buckram was a small horse-dealer--small, at least, when he was  buying, though great when he was selling. It would do a youngster good to  see Ben filling the two capacities. He dealt in second hand, that is to  say, past mark of mouth horses; but on the present occasion, Mr. Sponge  sought his services in the capacity of a letter rather than a seller of  horses. Mr. Sponge wanted to job a couple of plausible-looking horses, with  the option of buying them, provided he (Mr. Sponge) could sell them for  more than he would have to give Mr. Buckram, exclusive of the hire. Mr.  Buckram's job price, we should say, was as near twelve pounds a month,  containing twenty-eight days, as he could screw, the hirer, of course,  keeping the animals.    Scampley is one of those pretty little suburban farms, peculiar to the  north and north-west side of London--farms varying from fifty to a hundred  acres of well-manured, gravelly soil; each farm with its picturesque little  buildings, consisting of small, honey-suckled, rose-entwined brick houses,  with small, flat, pan-tiled roofs, and lattice-windows; and, hard by, a  large hay-stack, three times the size of the house, or a desolate barn,  half as big as all the rest of the buildings. From the smallness of the  holdings, the farmhouses are dotted about as thickly, and at such varying  distances from the roads, as to look like inferior 'villas,' falling out of  rank; most of them have a half-smart, half-seedy sort of look.    The rustics who cultivate them, or rather look after them, are neither  exactly town nor country. They have the clownish dress and boorish gait of  the regular 'chaws,' with a good deal of the quick, suspicious, sour  sauciness of the low London resident. If you can get an answer from them at  all, it is generally delivered in such a way as to show that the answerer  thinks you are what they call 'chaffing them,' asking them what you know.    These farms serve the double purpose of purveyors to the London stables,  and hospitals for sick, overworked, or unsaleable horses. All the great  job-masters and horse-dealers have these retreats in the country, and the  smaller ones pretend to have, from whence, in due course, they can draw any  sort of an animal a customer may want, just as little cellarless  wine-merchants can get you any sort of wine from real establishments--if  you only give them time.    There was a good deal of mystery about Scampley. It was sometimes in the  hands of Mr. Benjamin Buckram, sometimes in the hands of his assignees,  sometimes in those of his cousin, Abraham Brown, and sometimes John Doe and  Richard Roe were the occupants of it.    Mr. Benjamin Buckram, though very far from being one, had the advantage of  looking like a respectable man. There was a certain plump, well-fed  rosiness about him, which, aided by a bright-coloured dress, joined to a  continual fumble in the pockets of his drab trousers, gave him the air of a  'well-to-do-in-the-world' sort of man. Moreover, he sported a velvet collar  to his blue coat, a more imposing ornament than it appears at first sight.  To be sure, there are two sorts of velvet collars--the legitimate velvet  collar, commencing with the coat, and the adopted velvet collar, put on  when the cloth one gets shabby.    Buckram's was always the legitimate velvet collar, new from the first, and,  we really believe, a permanent velvet collar, adhered to in storm and in  sunshine, has a very money-making impression on the world. It shows a  spirit superior to feelings of paltry"]]]
