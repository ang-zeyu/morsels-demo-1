To the Present Time, Volume 10 (of 12) (#2)"],[1,"of the ruins of political independence still towered the monuments  of civilisation of a mighty past which gave to this country moral  independence, and prevented the obliteration of nationality. It would  have mattered very little in the vast empire of Alexander if one  province had a special physiognomy. It was different, however, with the  Lagidae: their power was concentrated in Egypt, and they were therefore  compelled to obliterate the separation existing between the conquering  and the conquered races, and fuse them, if possible, into one. A  great obstacle which confronted the Macedonian rulers in Egypt was  the religion of the country. The interest and the policy of the Lagidae  demanded the removal of this obstacle, not by force but by diplomacy.  Greek gods were therefore identified with Egyptian; Phtah became  Hephaestos; Thot, Hermes; Ra, Helios; Amon, Zeus; and, in consequence of  a dream which commanded him to offer adoration to a foreign god, Ptolemy  Soter created a new Greek god who was of Egyptian origin. Osiris at that  period was the great god of Egypt; Memphis was the religious centre of  the cult of Apis, the representative of Osiris, and who, when living,  was called Apis-Osiris, and when dead Osiris-Apis. Cambyses had killed  the god or his representative: it was a bad move. Alexander made  sacrifices to him: Ptolemy Soter did more. He endeavoured to persuade  the Egyptians that Osirapi or Osiris-Apis was also sacred to the Greeks,  and to identify him with some Greek divinity. There was a Greek deity  known as Serapis, identified with Pluton, the god of Hades. Serapis,  by a clever manouvre, a _coup de religion_, was identified with  Osiris-Apis. The lingual similarity and the fact that Osirapi was the  god of the Egyptian Hades made the identification acceptable.    Like true Greek princes, the Ptolemies had broad views and were very  tolerant. Keeping the Greek religion themselves, they were favourably  disposed towards the creeds of other nationalities under their  dominion. Thanks to this broad-mindedness and tolerance which had  become traditional in the Lagidas family, and which has only rarely been  imitated--to the detriment of civilisation--in the history of European  dynasties, Oriental and Hellenic culture could flourish side by side.  This benign government attracted many scholars, scientists, poets,  and philosophers. Alexandria became the intellectual metropolis of the  world; and it might truly be said to have been the Paris of antiquity.  At the courts of the Ptolemies, the Medicis of Egypt, the greatest  men of the age lived and taught. Demetrius Phalerius, one of the most  learned and cultured men of an age of learning and knowledge, when  driven from his luxurious palace at Athens, found hospitality at the  court of Ptolemy Soter. The foundation of the famous Museion and  library of Alexandria was most probably due to his influence. He  advised the first Ptolemy to found a building where poets, scholars, and  philosophers would have facilities for study, research, and speculation.  The Museion was similar in some respects to the Academy of Plato. It  was an edifice where scholars lived and worked together. Mental  qualification was the only requirement for admission. Nationality and  creed were no obstacles to those whose learning rendered them worthy of  becoming members of this ideal academy and of being received among the  immortals of antiquity. The Museion was in no sense a university, but an  academy for the cultivation of the higher branches of learning. It might  be compared in some respects to the College de France, or regarded as  a development of the system under which scholars had already lived and  worked together in the Ramesseum under Ramses II. The generosity of the  Lagidas provided amply for this new centre of learning and study. Free  from worldly cares, the scholars could leisurely gather information and  hand down to posterity the fruits of their researches. From all parts  of the world men flocked to this centre of fashionable learning, the  birthplace of modern science. All that was brilliant and cultured,  all the coryphees in the domain of intellect, were attracted by that  splendid court.    In the shade of the Museion a brilliant assembly--Ptolemy, Euclid,  Hipparchus, Apollonius, and Eratosthenes--made great discoveries and  added materially to the sum of human knowledge. Here Euclid wrote  his immortal \"Elements;\" and Herophilos, the father of surgery, added  valuable information to the knowledge of anatomy. The art and process  of embalming, in such vogue among the Egyptians, naturally fostered the  advance of this science. Whilst Alexandria in abstract speculation could  not rival Greece, yet it became the home of the pioneers of positive  science, who left a great and priceless legacy to modern civilisation.  The importance of this event (the foundation of the Museion), says  Draper, in his _Intellectual Development of Europe_, though hitherto  little understood, admits of no exaggeration so far as the intellectual  progress of Europe is concerned. The Museum made an impression upon the  intellectual career of Europe so powerful and enduring that we still  enjoy its results. If the purely literary productions of that age have  sometimes been looked upon with contempt, European intellectual  culture is still greatly indebted to Alexandria, and especially for the  patronage she accorded to the works of Aristotle. Whilst the speculative  mind was in later centuries allured by the supernatural, and the  discussion of the criterion of truth and the principles of morality  ended in the mystic doctrines of Neo-Platonism, the practical  tendencies of the great Alexandrine scholars were instrumental in laying  the foundations of science. To the Museion were attached the libraries:  one in the Museion itself, and another in the quarter Rhacotis in the  temple of Serapis, which contained about 700,000 volumes. New books were  continually acquired. The librarians had orders to pay any sum for the  original of the works of great masters. The Ptolemies were not only  patrons of learning but were themselves highly educated. Ptolemy Soter  was an historian of no mean talent, and his son Philadelphus, as a pupil  of the poet Philetas and the philosopher Strabo, was a man of great  learning. Ptolemy III. was a mathematician, and Ptolemy Philopator,  who had erected and dedicated a temple to Homer, was the writer of a  tragedy. The efforts of the Ptolemies to bring the two nationalities,  Hellenic and Egyptian, nearer to each other, to mould and weld them  into one if possible, to mix and mingle the two civilisations and thus  strengthen their own power, was greatly aided by the national character  of the Greeks and the political position of the Egyptians.    The Greeks found in Egypt a national culture and especially a religious  system. The pliant Hellenic genius could not remain insensible to that  ancient and marvellous civilisation with its sphinxes and hieroglyphics,  its pyramids and temples, its learning and thought, so strangely  perplexing and interesting to the Greek mind. Not only the magnificence  of Egyptian art, the majesty of her temples and palaces, but the wisdom  of her social and political institutions impressed the conquerors. They  made themselves acquainted with the institutions of the country; they  studied its history and took an interest in its religion and mythology.  Similarly, the conquered Egyptians, who had preferred the Macedonian  ruler to their Persian oppressors, exhibited a natural desire to learn  the languages and habits of their rulers, to make themselves acquainted  with their knowledge and phases of thought, and art and science. The  interest of the Greeks was strengthened by this, and the Egyptians were  made to see their history in its proper light. To this endeavour we owe  the history of Manetho. But, in spite of the policy of the Ptolemies,  the impressionable nature of the Hellenic character and the interest of  the Egyptians,--in spite of all that tended to a fusion of Hellenism and  Orientalism, it never came to a proper amalgamation. The contradiction  between the free-thought philosophy of Greece, which was fast outgrowing  its polytheism and Olympian worship, and the deeply rooted sacerdotal  system of the Pharaonian institutions, was too great and too flagrant.  Thus there never was an Egypto-Hellenic phase of thought. But there was  another civilisation of great antiquity, possessing peculiar features,  not less interesting for the Greek mind than that of Egypt itself, with  which Hellenism found itself face to face in the ancient land of the  Pharaohs. It was the civilisation of Judaea, between which and Greek  thought a greater fusion was effected.      II.    From time immemorial the Hebrew race, with all its conservative  tendencies in religious matters, has been amenable to the influence  of foreign culture and civilian. Egypt and Phoenicia, Babylonia and  Assyria, Hellas and Rome have exercised an immense influence over it.  It still is and always has been endeavouring to bring into harmony  the exclusiveness of its national religion, with a desire to adopt the  habits culture, language, and manners of its neighbours; an attempt in  which it may be apparently successful, for a certain period at least,  but which must always have a tragic end. It is impossible to be  conservative and progressive at the same time, to be both national and  cosmopolitan. The attempts to reconcile religious formalism and free  reasoning have never succeeded in the history of human thought. It soon  led to the conviction that one factor must be sacrificed, and, as soon  as this was perceived, the party of zealots was quickly at hand to  preach reaction. In the times of the successors of Alexander, the  Diadochae and Epigones, the Seleucidae and the Lagidae, who had divided the  vast dominion among them, Greek"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17331"],[0,"History of Egypt From 330 B.C. To the Present Time, Volume 11 (of 12) (#2)"],[1,"bull, Alexander had sacrificed to it;  had Augustus had the violent temper of either, he would have copied  Cambyses. The Egyptians always found the treatment of the sacred bull a  foretaste of what they were themselves to receive from their sovereigns.    The Greeks of Alexandria, who had for some time past very unwillingly  yielded to the Jews the right of citizenship, now urged upon Augustus  that it should no longer be granted. Augustus, however, had received  great services from the Jews, and at once refused the prayer; and he set  up in Alexandria an inscription granting to the Jews the full privileges  of Macedonians, which they claimed and had hitherto enjoyed under  the Ptolemies. They were allowed their own magistrates and courts  of justice, with the free exercise of their own religion; and soon  afterwards, when their high priest died, they were allowed as usual  to choose his successor. The Greek Jews of Alexandria were indeed very  important, both from their numbers and their learning; they spread over  Syria and Asia Minor: they had a synagogue in Jerusalem in common with  the Jews of Cyrene and Libya; and we find that one of the chief teachers  of Christianity after the apostles was Apollos, the Alexandrian, who  preached the new religion in Ephesus, in Corinth, and in Crete.    On his return to Rome, Augustus carried with him the whole of the royal  treasure; and though perhaps there might have been less gold and silver  than usual in the palace of the Ptolemies, still it was so large a sum  that when, upon the establishment of peace over all the world, the rate  of interest upon loans fell in Rome, and the price of land rose, the  change was thought to have been caused by the money from Alexandria.  At the same time were carried away the valuable jewels, furniture, and  ornaments, which had been handed down from father to son, with the  crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. These were drawn in waggons through the  streets of Rome in triumph; and with them were shown in chains to the  wondering crowd Alexander Helius and Cleopatra Selene, the children of  Cleopatra and Antony.    Augustus threatened a severe punishment to the Alexandrians in the  building of a new capital. Only four miles from the Canopic or eastern  gate of Alexandria he laid out the plan of his new city of Meopolis, on  the spot where he had routed Mark Antony's forces. Here he began  several large temples, and removed to them the public sacrifices and the  priesthood from the temples of Alexandria. But the work was carried  no farther, and soon abandoned; and the only change made by it in  Alexandria was that the temple of Serapis and the other temples were for  a time deserted.    The rest of the world had long been used to see their finest works of  art carried away by their conquerors; and the Egyptians soon learned  that, if any of the monuments of which they were so justly proud were  to be left to them, it would only be because they were too heavy to be  moved by the Roman engineers. Beside many other smaller Egyptian works,  two of the large obelisks, which even now ornament Rome, were carried  away by Augustus, that of Thutmosis IV., which stands in the Piazza del  Popolo, and that of Psammetichus, on Monte Citorio.    Cornelius Gallus, the prefect of Egypt, seems either to have  misunderstood, or soon forgotten, the terms of his appointment. He set  up statues of himself in the cities of Egypt, and, copying the kings  of the country, he carved his name and deeds upon the pyramids. On this  Augustus recalled him, and he killed himself to avoid punishment. The  emperor's wish to check the tyranny of the prefects and tax-gatherers  was strongly marked in the case of the champion fighting-cock. The  Alexandrians bred these birds with great care, and eagerly watched their  battles in the theatre. A powerful cock, that had hitherto slain all  its rivals and always strutted over the table unconquered, had gained a  great name in the city; and this bird, Eros, a tax-gatherer, roasted  and ate. Augustus, on hearing of this insult to the people, sent for the  man, and, on his owning what he had done, ordered him to be crucified.  Three legions and nine cohorts were found force enough to keep this  great kingdom in quiet obedience to their new masters; and when  Heroopolis revolted, and afterwards when a rebellion broke out in the  Thebaid against the Roman tax-gatherers, these risings were easily  crushed. The spirit of the nation, both of the Greeks and Egyptians,  seems to have been wholly broken; and Petronius, who succeeded  Cornelius Gallus, found no difficulty in putting down a rising of the  Alexandrians.    The canals, through which the overflowing waters of the Nile were  carried to the more distant fields, were, of course, each year more or  less blocked up by the same mud which made the fields fruitful; and the  clearing of these canals was one of the greatest boons that the monarch  could bestow upon the tillers of the soil. This had often been neglected  by the less powerful and less prudent kings of Egypt, in whose reigns  the husbandman believed that Heaven in its displeasure withheld part  of the wished-for overflow; but Petronius employed the leisure of his  soldiers on this wise and benevolent work. In order better to understand  the rise of the Nile, to fix the amount of the land-tax, and more fairly  to regulate the overflow through the canals, the Nilometer on the Island  of Elephantine was at this time made.    [Illustration: 011.jpg THE NILOMETER AT ELEPHANTINE]    It was under AElius Gallus, the third prefect, that Egypt was visited by  Strabo, the most careful and judicious of all the ancient travellers. He  had come to study mathematics, astronomy, and geography in the museum,  under the successors of Euclid, Eratosthenes, and Hipparchus. He  accompanied the prefect in a march to Syene (Aswan), the border town,  and he has left us a valuable account of the state of the country at  that time. Alexandria was the chief object that engaged his attention.  Its two harbours held more ships than were to be seen in any other port  in the world, and its export trade was thought greater than that of all  Italy. The docks on each side of the causeway, and the ship canal, from  the harbour of Eunostus to the Mareotic Lake, were full of bustle and  activity. The palace or citadel on the promontory of Lochias on one side  of the great harbour was as striking an object as the lighthouse on the  other. The temples and palaces covered a space of ground equal to more  than one-fourth part of the city, and the suburbs reached even beyond  the Mareotic Lake. Among the chief buildings were the Soma, which held  the bodies of Alexander and of the Ptolemies; the court of justice;  the museum of philosophy, which had been rebuilt since the burning by  Caesar's soldiers; the exchange, crowded with merchants, the temple of  Neptune, and Mark Antony's fortress, called the Timonium, on a point of  land which jutted into the harbour; the Caesarium, or new palace; and the  great temple of Serapis, which was on the western side of the city, and  was the largest and most ornamented of all these buildings. Farther off  was the beautiful gymnasium for wrestlers and boxers, with its porticoes  of a stadium in length, where the citizens used to meet in public  assembly. From the top of the temple of Pan, which rose like a  sugar-loaf in the middle of the city, and was mounted by a winding  staircase, the whole of this remarkable capital might be seen spread  out before the eye. On the east of the city was the circus, for  chariot races, and on the west lay the public gardens and pale green  palm-groves, and the Necropolis ornamenting the roadside with tombs for  miles along the seashore. Other tombs were in the catacombs underground  on the same side of the city. The banks of the Mareotic Lake were  fringed with vineyards, which bore the famed wine of the same name,  and which formed a pleasant contrast with the burning whiteness of the  desert beyond. The canal from the lake to the Nile marked its course  through the plain by the greater freshness of the green along its banks.  In the distance were the new buildings of Augustus' city of Nicopolis.  The arts of Greece and the wealth of Egypt had united to adorn the  capital of the Ptolemies. Heliopolis, the ancient seat of Egyptian  learning, had never been wholly repaired since its siege by Cambyses,  and was then almost a deserted city. Its schools were empty, its  teachers silent; but the houses in which Plato and his friend Eudoxus  were said to have dwelt and studied were pointed out to the traveller,  to warm his love of knowledge and encourage him in the pursuit of  virtue. Memphis was the second city in Egypt, while Thebes and Abydos,  the former capitals, had fallen to the size and rank of villages. At  Memphis Strabo saw the bull-fights in the circus, and was allowed to  look at the bull Apis through a window of his stable. At Crocodilopolis  he saw the sacred crocodile caught on the banks of the lake and fed  with cakes and wine. Ptolemais, which was at first only an encampment of  Greek soldiers, had risen under the sovereigns to whom it owed its name  to be the largest city in the Thebaid, and scarcely less than Memphis.  It was built wholly by the Greeks, and, like Alexandria, it was under  Greek laws, while the other cities in Egypt were under Egyptian laws and  magistrates. It was situated between Panopolis and Abydos; but, while  the temples of Thebes, which were built so many centuries earlier, are  still standing in awful grandeur, scarcely a trace of this Greek city  can be found in the villages of El Menshieh and Girgeh (Cerkasoros),  which now stand on the spot. Strabo and the Roman generals did not  forget to visit the broken colossal statue of Amenhothes, near Thebes,  which sent forth its musical sounds every morning, as the sun, rising  over the Arabian hills,"]]]
