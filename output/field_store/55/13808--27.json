As showing the opinion of those with whom Mr. Clark was  intimately and officially associated for so long a time, the  following resolutions passed by the Board of Commissioners upon  his voluntary retirement from the office of Guardian, are herein  given:         Whereas, Galen Clark has for a long number of years been       closely identified with Yosemite Valley, and has for a       considerable portion of that time been its Guardian; and         Whereas, he has now, by his own choice and will,       relinquished the trust confided in him and retired into       private life; and         Whereas, his faithful and eminent services as Guardian, his       constant efforts to preserve, protect and enhance the       beauties of Yosemite; his dignified, kindly and courteous       demeanor to all who have come to see and enjoy its wonders,       and his upright and noble life, deserve from us a fitting       recognition and memorial; Now, Therefore, be it         Resolved, That the cordial assurance of the appreciation by       this Commission of the efforts and labors of Galen Clark, as       Guardian of Yosemite, in its behalf, be tendered and       expressed to him.         That we recognize in him a faithful, efficient and worthy       citizen and officer of this Commission and of the State;       that he will be followed into his retirement by the       sincerest and best wishes of this Commission, individually       and as a body, for continued long life and constant       happiness.    The subject of this sketch is one of the most modest of men; but  perfectly self-reliant, and always actively engaged in some  useful work. He has resided in the Valley for more than twenty  summers, and has also been a resident during many winters, and  his descriptions of the Valley, when wrapped in snow and ice, are  intensely interesting. Though always ready to give information,  he is naturally reticent, and never forces his stories or  reminiscences upon visitors; indeed it requires some persuasion  to hear him talk about himself at all. For some years Mr. Clark  was postmaster of Yosemite; and he has made many trips on foot,  both in winter and summer, in and out of the Valley.    In September, 1903, this writer made a trip through the high  Sierras from Yosemite, and, upon reaching the top of the Valley  Mr. Clark was met coming down the trail, having in charge a party  of his friends, amongst whom was a lady with her two small  children. This was at a point 2700 feet above the floor of the  Valley, which is itself 4000 feet above the level of the sea.    Needless to say, he is perfectly familiar with all the mountain  trails, and, notwithstanding his great age, he easily makes long  trips on foot and horseback which would fatigue a much younger  man. Mr. Clark is thoroughly familiar with the flora, fauna and  geology of the Valley and its surroundings. His knowledge of  botany is particularly accurate, a knowledge gleaned partly from  books, but mainly from close personal observation, the best  possible teacher.    His long residence in Yosemite has made him familiar with every  spot, his love for the Valley is deep and strong, and when he  departs this life his remains will rest close to the Yosemite  Falls, in the little grave yard where other pioneers are buried.    With his own hands he has dug his grave, and quarried his own  tombstone from one of the massive blocks of granite found in the  immediate neighborhood. His monument now rests in his grave, and  when it is removed to receive his remains, will be used to mark  his last resting place. His grave is surrounded by a neat fence,  and trees, shrubs and vines, which he has himself planted, grow  around in great profusion. In each corner of the lot is a young  _Sequoia_.    May it be many years before he is called to occupy his last  earthly tenement.    W.W. FOOTE.    _San Francisco,  February, 1904_.          INDIANS OF THE YOSEMITE          INDIANS OF THE YOSEMITE          Chapter One.    EARLY HISTORY.      During the past few years a rapidly growing interest in the  native Indians has been manifested by a large majority of  visitors to the Yosemite Valley. They have evinced a great desire  to see them in their rudely constructed summer camps, and to  purchase some articles of their artistic basket and bead work, to  take away as highly prized souvenirs.    They are also anxious to learn something of their former modes of  life, habits and domestic industries, before their original  tribal relations were ruthlessly broken up by the sudden advent  of the white population of gold miners and others in 1850, and  the subsequent war, in which the Indians were defeated, and, as  a result, nearly exterminated.      ORIGIN OF THE YOSEMITE INDIANS.    According to statements made by Teneiya _(Ten-eye'-ya)_ [see  footnote] chief of the Yosemites, to Dr. L.H. Bunnell, and  published by him in his book on the \"Discovery of the Yosemite\",  the original Indian name of the Valley was Ah-wah'-nee, which  has been translated as \"deep grassy valley\", and the Indians  living there were called Ah-wah-nee'-chees, which signified  \"dwellers in Ah-wah'-nee.\"    [Footnote: The Indian names are usually pronounced exactly as  spelled, with each syllable distinctly sounded, and the principal  accent on the penult, as in Ah-wah'-nee, or the antepenult, as  in Yo-sem'-i-te. Where doubt might exist, the accent will be  indicated, or the pronunciation given in parenthesis.]    [Transcriber's note: The remaining footnotes in the original text are  moved, in the present version, into the line of text and are  marked by square brackets, thus: Ah-wah'-nee [Yosemite Valley].]    Many years ago, the old chief said, the Ah-wah-nee'-chees had  been a large and powerful tribe, but by reason of wars and a  fatal black sickness, nearly all had been destroyed, and the  survivors of the band fled from the Valley and joined other  tribes.    [Illustration: _Photograph by Fiske_.  YOSEMITE FALLS (CHO'-LACK), 2,634 Feet.  Near the foot of these falls was located the village of  Ah-wah'-nee, the Indian capital and residence of Chief Teneiya.  There were eight other villages in the Valley.]    For years afterwards this locality was uninhabited, but finally  Teneiya, who claimed to be descended from an Ah-wah-nee'-chee  chief, left the Mo'nos, where he had born and brought up,  and, gathering of his father's old tribe around him, visited the  Valley and claimed it as the birthright of his people. He then  became the founder of a new tribe or band, which received the  name \"Yo-sem'-i-te.\" This word signifies a full-grown grizzly  bear, and Teneiya said that the name had been given to his band  because they occupied the mountains and valley which were the  favorite resort of the grizzly bears, and his people were expert  in killing them; that his tribe had adopted the name because  those who had bestowed it were afraid of the grizzlies, and also  feared his band.    The Yosemites were perhaps the most warlike of any of the tribes  in this part of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, who were, as a rule,  a peaceful people, dividing the territory among them, and  indulging in few controversies. In fact, these Indians in general  were less belligerent and warlike than any others on the Pacific  Coast. When difficulties arose, they were usually settled  peacefully by arbitration, in a grand council of the chiefs and  head men of the tribes involved, without resorting to open  hostilities.      OTHER TRIBES.    Other bands of Indians in the vicinity of the Yosemite Valley  were the Po-ho-nee'-chees who lived near the headwaters of the  Po-ho'-no or Bridal Veil Creek in summer, and on the South Fork  of the Merced' River in winter, about twelve miles below  Wawo'na; the Po-to-en'-cies, who lived on the Merced River;  Wil-tuc-um'-nees, Tuol'-unme River; Noot'-choos and  Chow-chil'-las, Chowchilla Valley; Ho-na'-ches and  Me'-woos, Fresno River and vicinity; and Chook-chan'-ces, San  Joaquin River and vicinity.    These tribes, including the Yosemites, were all somewhat  affiliated by common ancestry or by intermarriage, and were  similar in their general characteristics and customs. They were  all called by the early California settlers, \"Digger Indians,\" as  a term of derision, on account of their not being good fighters,  and from their practice of digging the tuberous roots of certain  plants, for food.      INDIAN WAR OF 1851.    Dr. Bunnell, in his book already referred to, has given the  soldiers' and white men's account of the cause of the Indian war  of 1851, but a statement of the grievances on the part of the  Indians, which caused the uniting of all the different tribes in  the mining region adjacent to Yosemite, in an attempt to drive  the white invaders from their country, has never been published,  and a brief account of these grievances may be interesting.      AGGRESSIONS BY THE WHITE SETTLERS.    The first parties of prospecting miners were welcomed by the  Indians with their usual friendliness and hospitality toward  strangers--a universal characteristic of these tribes,--and the  mining for gold was watched with great interest. They soon  learned the value of the gold dust, and some of them engaged in  mining, and exchanged their gold at the trading stations for  blankets and fancy trinkets, at an enormous profit to the  traders, and peace and good feeling prevailed for a short time.    The report of the rich gold \"diggin's\" on the waters of the  Tuolumne, Merced, Mariposa, Chowchilla, and Fresno Rivers, soon  spread, and miners by thousands came and took possession of the  whole country, paying no regard to the natural rights or wishes  of the Indians.    Some of the Indian chiefs made the proposition that if the miners  would give them some of the gold which they found in their part  of the country, they might stay and work.

At length entering into some animal of a nature congenial to  her former life of sensuality or violence, she takes the form of an ass,  a wolf or a kite. And of these earthly souls the happiest are those who  have practised virtue without philosophy; they are allowed to pass into  gentle and social natures, such as bees and ants. (Compare Republic,  Meno.) But only the philosopher who departs pure is permitted to enter  the company of the gods. (Compare Phaedrus.) This is the reason why he  abstains from fleshly lusts, and not because he fears loss or disgrace,  which is the motive of other men. He too has been a captive, and the  willing agent of his own captivity. But philosophy has spoken to him,  and he has heard her voice; she has gently entreated him, and brought  him out of the 'miry clay,' and purged away the mists of passion and  the illusions of sense which envelope him; his soul has escaped from the  influence of pleasures and pains, which are like nails fastening her to  the body. To that prison-house she will not return; and therefore she  abstains from bodily pleasures--not from a desire of having more or  greater ones, but because she knows that only when calm and free from  the dominion of the body can she behold the light of truth.    Simmias and Cebes remain in doubt; but they are unwilling to raise  objections at such a time. Socrates wonders at their reluctance. Let  them regard him rather as the swan, who, having sung the praises of  Apollo all his life long, sings at his death more lustily than ever.  Simmias acknowledges that there is cowardice in not probing truth to the  bottom. 'And if truth divine and inspired is not to be had, then let  a man take the best of human notions, and upon this frail bark let him  sail through life.' He proceeds to state his difficulty: It has been  argued that the soul is invisible and incorporeal, and therefore  immortal, and prior to the body. But is not the soul acknowledged to  be a harmony, and has she not the same relation to the body, as the  harmony--which like her is invisible--has to the lyre? And yet the  harmony does not survive the lyre. Cebes has also an objection, which  like Simmias he expresses in a figure. He is willing to admit that the  soul is more lasting than the body. But the more lasting nature of the  soul does not prove her immortality; for after having worn out many  bodies in a single life, and many more in successive births and  deaths, she may at last perish, or, as Socrates afterwards restates the  objection, the very act of birth may be the beginning of her death, and  her last body may survive her, just as the coat of an old weaver is left  behind him after he is dead, although a man is more lasting than his  coat. And he who would prove the immortality of the soul, must prove not  only that the soul outlives one or many bodies, but that she outlives  them all.    The audience, like the chorus in a play, for a moment interpret the  feelings of the actors; there is a temporary depression, and then the  enquiry is resumed. It is a melancholy reflection that arguments, like  men, are apt to be deceivers; and those who have been often deceived  become distrustful both of arguments and of friends. But this  unfortunate experience should not make us either haters of men or haters  of arguments. The want of health and truth is not in the argument, but  in ourselves. Socrates, who is about to die, is sensible of his own  weakness; he desires to be impartial, but he cannot help feeling that he  has too great an interest in the truth of the argument. And therefore he  would have his friends examine and refute him, if they think that he is  in error.    At his request Simmias and Cebes repeat their objections. They do not  go to the length of denying the pre-existence of ideas. Simmias is of  opinion that the soul is a harmony of the body. But the admission of the  pre-existence of ideas, and therefore of the soul, is at variance with  this. (Compare a parallel difficulty in Theaet.) For a harmony is  an effect, whereas the soul is not an effect, but a cause; a harmony  follows, but the soul leads; a harmony admits of degrees, and the soul  has no degrees. Again, upon the supposition that the soul is a harmony,  why is one soul better than another? Are they more or less harmonized,  or is there one harmony within another? But the soul does not admit of  degrees, and cannot therefore be more or less harmonized. Further, the  soul is often engaged in resisting the affections of the body, as Homer  describes Odysseus 'rebuking his heart.' Could he have written this  under the idea that the soul is a harmony of the body? Nay rather, are  we not contradicting Homer and ourselves in affirming anything of the  sort?    The goddess Harmonia, as Socrates playfully terms the argument of  Simmias, has been happily disposed of; and now an answer has to be given  to the Theban Cadmus. Socrates recapitulates the argument of Cebes,  which, as he remarks, involves the whole question of natural growth or  causation; about this he proposes to narrate his own mental experience.  When he was young he had puzzled himself with physics: he had enquired  into the growth and decay of animals, and the origin of thought, until  at last he began to doubt the self-evident fact that growth is the  result of eating and drinking; and so he arrived at the conclusion that  he was not meant for such enquiries. Nor was he less perplexed with  notions of comparison and number. At first he had imagined himself to  understand differences of greater and less, and to know that ten is two  more than eight, and the like. But now those very notions appeared to  him to contain a contradiction. For how can one be divided into two? Or  two be compounded into one? These are difficulties which Socrates cannot  answer. Of generation and destruction he knows nothing. But he has a  confused notion of another method in which matters of this sort are to  be investigated. (Compare Republic; Charm.)    Then he heard some one reading out of a book of Anaxagoras, that mind is  the cause of all things. And he said to himself: If mind is the cause  of all things, surely mind must dispose them all for the best. The new  teacher will show me this 'order of the best' in man and nature. How  great had been his hopes and how great his disappointment! For he found  that his new friend was anything but consistent in his use of mind as  a cause, and that he soon introduced winds, waters, and other eccentric  notions. (Compare Arist. Metaph.) It was as if a person had said that  Socrates is sitting here because he is made up of bones and muscles,  instead of telling the true reason--that he is here because the  Athenians have thought good to sentence him to death, and he has thought  good to await his sentence. Had his bones and muscles been left by him  to their own ideas of right, they would long ago have taken themselves  off. But surely there is a great confusion of the cause and condition  in all this. And this confusion also leads people into all sorts of  erroneous theories about the position and motions of the earth. None of  them know how much stronger than any Atlas is the power of the best. But  this 'best' is still undiscovered; and in enquiring after the cause, we  can only hope to attain the second best.    Now there is a danger in the contemplation of the nature of things, as  there is a danger in looking at the sun during an eclipse, unless the  precaution is taken of looking only at the image reflected in the water,  or in a glass. (Compare Laws; Republic.) 'I was afraid,' says Socrates,  'that I might injure the eye of the soul. I thought that I had better  return to the old and safe method of ideas. Though I do not mean to say  that he who contemplates existence through the medium of ideas sees  only through a glass darkly, any more than he who contemplates actual  effects.'    If the existence of ideas is granted to him, Socrates is of opinion that  he will then have no difficulty in proving the immortality of the soul.  He will only ask for a further admission:--that beauty is the cause of  the beautiful, greatness the cause of the great, smallness of the small,  and so on of other things. This is a safe and simple answer, which  escapes the contradictions of greater and less (greater by reason of  that which is smaller!), of addition and subtraction, and the other  difficulties of relation. These subtleties he is for leaving to wiser  heads than his own; he prefers to test ideas by the consistency of their  consequences, and, if asked to give an account of them, goes back to  some higher idea or hypothesis which appears to him to be the best,  until at last he arrives at a resting-place. (Republic; Phil.)    The doctrine of ideas, which has long ago received the assent of the  Socratic circle, is now affirmed by the Phliasian auditor to command  the assent of any man of sense. The narrative is continued; Socrates is  desirous of explaining how opposite ideas may appear to co-exist but do  not really co-exist in the same thing or person. For example, Simmias  may be said to have greatness and also smallness, because he is greater  than Socrates and less than Phaedo. And yet Simmias is not really great  and also small, but only when compared to Phaedo and Socrates. I use the  illustration, says Socrates, because I want to show you not only that  ideal opposites exclude one another, but also the opposites in us. I,  for example, having the attribute of smallness remain small, and cannot  become great: the smallness which is in me drives out greatness.    One of the company here remarked that this was inconsistent with the  old assertion that opposites generated opposites. But that, replies  Socrates, was affirmed, not of opposite ideas either in us or in  nature, but of opposition in the concrete--not of life and death, but  of individuals living "]]]
