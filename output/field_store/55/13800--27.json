Mother-less, and her father a recluse, she was  left to bring herself up, and to bestow her affections where she might. To  Kenelm's ardour she responded readily; and he philandered about her for a  year or two. But his mother would hear nothing of the match; and at  seventeen he was sent out on the grand tour, the object of which, we learn  from his _Memoirs_, was \"to banish admiration, which for the most part  accompanieth home-bred minds, and is daughter of ignorance.\" Kenelm proved  better than the ideal set before him; and the more he travelled the more he  admired.    Into this tale of love and adventure I must break with the disturbing  intelligence that the handsome and romantic and spirited youth was in all  probability already procuring material for the compilation on _Physick and  Chirurgery_, which Hartman, his steward, published after his death. It was  not as a middle-aged _bon viveur_, nor as an elderly hypochondriac, that he  began his medical studies, but in the heyday of youth, and quite seriously,  too. The explanation brings with it light on some other of his interests as  well. When he set out on the grand tour, his head full of love and the  prospects of adventure, he found the spare energy to write from London to a  good friend of his, the Rev. Mr. Sandy, Parson of Great Lindford. In this  letter--the original is in the Ashmolean--Kenelm asks for the good parson's  prayers, and sends him \"a manuscript of elections of divers good authors.\"  Mr. Longueville, who gives the letter, has strangely failed to identify  Sandy with the famous Richard Napier, parson, physician, and astrologer, of  the well-known family of Napier of Merchistoun. His father, Alexander  Napier, was often known as \"Sandy\"; and the son held the alternative names  also. Great Lindford is two and a half miles from Gothurst; and it is  possible that Protestant friends, perhaps Laud himself, urged on the good  parson the duty of looking after the young Catholic gentleman. Sandy  (Napier) was also probably his mother's medical adviser: he certainly acted  as such to some members of her family. A man of fervent piety--his \"knees  were horny with frequent praying,\" says Aubrey--he was, besides, a zealous  student of alchemy and astrology, a friend of Dee, of Lilly, and of  Booker. Very likely Kenelm had been entrusted to Allen's care at Oxford on  the recommendation of Sandy; for Allen, one of his intimates, was a serious  occultist, who, according to his servant's account, \"used to meet the  spirits on the stairs like swarms of bees.\" With these occupations Napier  combined a large medical practice in the Midlands, the proceeds of which he  gave to the poor, living ascetically himself. His favourite nephew, Richard  Napier the younger, his pupil in all these arts and sciences, was about the  same age as Kenelm, and spent his holidays at Great Lindford. The  correspondence went on. Digby continued his medical observations abroad;  and after his return we find him writing to Sandy, communicating \"some  receipts,\" and asking for pills that had been ordered. Thus we have arrived  at the early influences which drew the young Catholic squire towards the  art of healing and the occult sciences. The latter he dabbled in all his  life. In the former his interest was serious and steadfast.    He remained out of England three years. From Paris the plague drove him to  Angers, where the appearance of the handsome English youth caused such  commotion in the heart of the Queen Mother, Marie de Medicis, that she  evidently lost her head. His narrative of her behaviour had to be  expurgated when his _Memoirs_ were published in 1827. He fled these royal  attentions; spread a report of his death, and made his way to Italy. His  two years in Florence were not all spent about the Grand-ducal Court. His  mind, keen and of infinite curiosity, was hungering after the universal  knowledge he aspired to; and Galileo, then writing his Dialogues in his  retirement at Bellosguardo, could not have been left unvisited by the eager  young student. In after years, Digby used to say that it was in Florence he  met the Carmelite friar who brought from the East the secret of the Powder  of Sympathy, which cured wounds without contact. The friar who had refused  to divulge the secret to the Grand Duke confided it to him--of which more  hereafter.    From Florence he passed to Spain; and his arrival was happily  timed--probably by his ever anxious kinsman; for a few days later Prince  Charles and Buckingham landed, on the Spanish Marriage business; and so  agreeable was young Digby that, in spite of Buckingham's dislike of his  name, he became part of the Prince's household, and returned with the party  in October, 1623. Court favours seemed now to open out a career for him.  King James knighted him, in what might have proved a fatal ceremony; for so  tremblingly nervous of the naked steel was the royal hand, that Buckingham  had to turn the sword aside from doing damage instead of honour. He was  also made Gentleman of the Bedchamber to Prince Charles. But no other  signal favours followed these. For all his agreeableness he was not of the  stuff courtiers are made of--though James had a kindness for him, and was  entertained by his eagerness and ingenuity. Bacon, too, just before his  death, had come across this zealous young student of the experimental  methods, and had meant, Digby said, to include an account of the Powder of  Sympathy in an appendix to his _Natural History_.    In Spain, Kenelm had flirted with some Spanish ladies, notably with the  beautiful Donna Anna Maria Manrique, urged thereto by gibes at his  coldness; but Venetia was still the lady of his heart. Her amorous  adventures, in the meanwhile, had been more serious and much more  notorious. His letters had miscarried, and had been kept back by his  mother. Venetia pleaded her belief in his death. Aubrey's account of her is  a mass of picturesque scandal. \"She was a most beautiful desirable  creature.... The young eagles had espied her, and she was sanguine and  tractable, and of much suavity (which to abuse was great pittie).\" Making  all allowance for gossip, the truth seems to be that in Kenelm's absence  she had been at least the mistress of Sir Edward Sackville, afterwards the  fourth Earl of Dorset; that Dorset tired of her; and on Digby's return she  was more than willing to return to her old love. But, alas! Sackville had  her picture, which seemed to her compromising. Digby, therefore, having  accepted her apologies and extenuations, challenged Sackville to a duel;  whereupon the faithless one proved at least magnanimous; refused to fight,  gave up the picture, and swore that Venetia was blameless as she was fair.  A private marriage followed; and it was only on the birth of his second son  John that Sir Kenelm acknowledged it to the world. To read nearly all his  _Memoirs_ is to receive the impression that he looked on his wife as a  wronged innocent. To read the whole is to feel he knew the truth and took  the risk, which was not very great after all; for the lady of the many  suitors and several adventures settled down to the mildest domesticity.  They say he was jealous; but no one has said she gave him cause. The tale  runs that Dorset visited them once a year, and \"only kissed her hand, Sir  Kenelm being by.\"    But Digby was a good lover. All the absurd rhodomontade of his strange  _Memoirs_ notwithstanding, there are gleams of rare beauty in the story of  his passion, which raise him to the level of the great lovers. His  _Memoirs_ were designed to tell \"the beginning, progress, and consummation  of that excellent love, which only makes me believe that our pilgrimage in  this world is not indifferently laid upon all persons for a curse.\" And  here is a very memorable thing. \"Understanding and love are the natural  operation of a reasonable creature; and this last, which is a gift that of  his own nature must always be bestowed, _being the only thing that is  really in his power to bestow_, it is the worthiest and noblest that can be  given.\"    But, as he naively says, \"the relations that follow marriage are ... a clog  to an active mind\"; and his kinsman Bristol was ever urging him to show his  worth \"by some generous action.\" The result of this urging was Scanderoon.  His object, plainly stated, was to ruin Venetian trade in the Levant, to  the advantage of English commerce. The aid and rescue of Algerian slaves  were afterthoughts. King James promised him a commission; but Buckingham's  secretary, on behalf of his master absent in the Ile de Re, thought his  privileges were being infringed, and the King drew back. Digby acted  throughout as if he had a \"publike charge,\" but he was really little other  than a pirate. He sailed from Deal in December, 1627, his ships the \"Eagle\"  and the \"George and Elizabeth.\" It was six months before the decisive fight  took place; but on the way he had captured some French and Spanish ships  near Gibraltar; and what with skirmishes and sickness, his voyage did not  want for risk and episode at any time. Digby the landsman maintained  discipline, reconciled quarrels, doctored his men, ducked them for  disorderliness, and directed the naval and military operations like any old  veteran. At Scanderoon [now Alexandretta in the Levant] the French and  Venetians, annoyed by his presence, fired on his ships. He answered with  such pluck and decision that, after a three hours' fight, the enemy was  completely at his mercy, and the Venetians \"quitted to him the signiority  of the roade.\" In his Journal of the Voyage you may read a sober account,  considering who was the teller of the tale, of a brilliant exploit. He does  not disguise the fact that he was acting in defiance of his own countrymen  in the Levant. The Vice-Consul at Scanderoon kept telling him"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16444"],[0,"Indian Unrest (#2)"],[1,"secular dominion, may  be ascribed the tendency to disloyalty among the Maratha Brahmins.    The case of Bengal is very different. Poona and Calcutta are separated  geographically almost by the whole breadth of India between two seas;  yet the historical antecedents of the Bengalees and Marathas are even  further apart. The Marathas were the leaders of revolt against the  Moghal Empire; they were formidable opponents to the rise of the British  power; their chiefs fought hard before yielding to British authority. On  the other hand, Lower Bengal belonged to a province that had fallen away  from the Moghal Empire, and which was transferred from its Mahomedan  Governor to a British General by the result of a single battle at  Plassey. The Bengalees took no part in the contest, and they had very  good reason for willing acquiescence in the change of masters.    In a comparison, therefore, of the Marathas with the people of Bengal,  we have a remarkable instance of the production of similar effects from  causes very distinct and dissimilar. In the former case their present  unrest may be traced, in a large degree, to the memories of early  rulership and to warlike traditions. In the latter case there can be no  such recollections, military or political, for the country has had no  experience whatever of a state of war, since Lower Bengal is perhaps the  only considerable province of India which has enjoyed profound peace  during nearly 150 years. It is no paradox to suggest that this prolonged  tranquillity has had some share in stimulating the audacity of Bengalee  unrest, for the literary classes seem to have no clear notion that the  real game of revolutionary politics is necessarily rough and  dangerous--certain, moreover, to fail whenever the British Government  shall have resolved that it is being carried too far, and must end.    But it is beyond question that the promoters of disaffection on both  sides of India have been making strenuous exertions to enlist in the  movement the influence of Brahminism; and upon this point the book  rightly lays particular stress.    The position and privileges of the Brahmins are rightly compared to  those of the Levites; they are the depositories of orthodox tradition;  they preside over and hold (not exclusively) a monopoly for the  performance of the sacred rites and offices; and ritual in Hinduism, as  in most of the ancient religions, is the essential element; it is  closely connected with the rules of caste, which unite and divide  innumerable groups within the pale of Hinduism. And in India the  peculiar institution of caste, the strict regulation of social  intercourse, particularly in regard to inter-marriage and the sharing of  food, prevails to an extent quite unknown elsewhere in the world. The  divisions of caste have always operated to weaken the body politic in  India, and thus to facilitate foreign conquest; but, on the other hand,  they have opposed a stiff barrier to the invasion of foreign religions,  to the fusion of alien races with the Hindu people, and to any success  in what may be called national unification.    One can easily understand the formidable power invested by this system  in the Brahmins, and the enormous obstacles that it might raise against  the introduction of Western ideas, manners, and education. Nevertheless  we all know, and we have seen it with real satisfaction, that the  Brahmins, very much to the credit of their intelligence and sagacity,  have been forward in accepting the new learning, the expansion of  general knowledge, offered to them by English schools and Universities;  they have acquired our language, they have studied our sciences; they  are prominent in the professions of law and medicine, which the English  have created; they enter our civil services, they even serve in the  Indian Army. Yet their readiness to adopt secular culture does not seem  to have abated their religious authority, or to have sensibly weakened  their influence over the people at large. And indeed the fact that the  Brahmins, with others of the educated classes, should have been able,  for their own purposes, to appeal simultaneously to the darkest  superstitions of Hinduism and to extreme ideas of Western democracy--to  disregard caste rules personally and to stir up caste prejudices among  the masses--will not greatly surprise those who have observed the  extraordinary elasticity of practical Hinduism, the fictions and  anomalies which can be invented or tolerated at need. But the beliefs  and practices of popular Hinduism are obviously irreconcilable with the  principles of modern civilization; and the various indications of a  desire to reform and purify their ancient religion may be partly due to  the perception among educated Hindus that so contradictory a position is  ultimately untenable, that the incongruity between sacrifices to the  goddess Kali and high University degrees is too manifest.    The course and consequences of the measures taken by the British  Government to promote Western education in India has been attentively  studied by the author of this volume. It is a story of grave political  miscalculation, containing a lesson that has its significance for other  nations which have undertaken a similar enterprise. Ignorance is  unquestionably the root of many evils; and it was natural that in the  last century certain philosophers should have assumed education to be  the certain cure for human delusions; and that statesmen like Macaulay  should have declared education to be the best and surest remedy for  political discontent and for law-breaking. In any case it was the clear  and imperative duty of the British Government to attempt the  intellectual emancipation of India as the best justification of British  rule. We have since discovered, by experience, that, although education  is a sovereign remedy for many ills--is indeed indispensable to healthy  progress--yet an indiscriminate or superficial administration of this  potent medicine may engender other disorders. It acts upon the frame of  an antique society as a powerful dissolvent, heating weak brains,  stimulating rash ambitions, raising inordinate expectations of which the  disappointment is bitterly resented. That these effects are well known  even in Europe may be read in a remarkable French novel published not  long ago, \"Les Deracines,\" which, describes the road to ruin taken by  poor collegians who had been uprooted from the soil of their humble  village. And in Asia the disease is necessarily much more virulent,  because the transition has been more sudden, and the contrast between  old ideas of life and new aspirations is far sharper. From the report of  an able French official upon the Indo-Chinese Colonies we may learn that  the existing system of educating the natives has proved to be  mischievous, needing radical reform. Of the Levantine youths in the  Syrian towns, the product of European schools, a French traveller writes  (1909), \"C'est une tourbe de declasses\"; while in China some leaders of  agitation for democratic changes in the oldest of all Empires are said  to be those who have qualified by competitive examination for public  employ, and have failed to obtain it. In every country the crowd of  expectants far outnumbers the places available. If, indeed, the  Government which introduced Western education into Bengal had been  native instead of foreign, it would have found itself entangled in  difficulties no less grave than those which now confront the British  rulers; and there can be little doubt that it would probably have broken  down under them.    The phases through which the State's educational policy in India have  passed during the last fifty years are explained at length in this  volume. The Government was misled in the wrong direction by the reports  of two Commissions between 1880 and 1890, whose mistakes were discerned  at the time by those who had some tincture of political prudence. The  problem is now to reconstruct on a better plan, to try different lines  of advance. But some of us have heard of an enterprising pioneer in a  difficult country, who confidently urged travellers to take a new route  by assuring them that it avoided the hills on the old road. Whether the  hills were equally steep on his other road he did not say. And in the  present instance it may not be easy to strike out a fresh path which may  be clear from the complications that have been suffered to grow up  round our system of Indian education; while no one proposes to turn  back. The truth is that in India the English have been throughout  obliged to lay out their own roads, and to feel their way, without any  precedents to guide them. No other Government, European or Asiatic, has  yet essayed to administer a great Oriental population, alien in race and  religion, by institutions of a representative type, reckoning upon free  discussion and an unrestricted Press for reasonable consideration of its  measures and fair play, relying upon secular education and absolute  religious neutrality to control the unruly affections of sinful men. It  is now seen that our Western ideas and inventions, moral and material,  are being turned against us by some of those to whom we have imparted an  elementary aptitude for using them. And thus we have the strange  spectacle, in certain parts of India, of a party capable of resorting to  methods that are both reactionary and revolutionary, of men who offer  prayers and sacrifices to ferocious divinities and denounce the  Government by seditious journalism, preaching primitive superstition in  the very modern form of leading articles. The mixture of religion with  politics has always produced a highly explosive compound, especially in  Asia.    These agitations are in fact the symptoms of what are said by  Shakespeare to be the \"cankers of a calm world\"; they are the natural  outcome of artificial culture in an educational"]]]
