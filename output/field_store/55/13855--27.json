[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17309"],[0,"The Summons of the Lord of Hosts (#2)"],[1," to  undertake and review these translations the deep gratitude we feel for the  care and sensitivity they have brought to the task. Baha'is will recognize  key passages from several of the Tablets that were introduced to the West  by Shoghi Effendi. His translations into English of the Baha'i Holy Texts  provide an enduring standard for the efforts of those who rise to the  challenge of preparing appropriate renderings into English of these  treasures of the Faith.                                                The Universal House of Justice            SURIY-I-HAYKAL      _This is the Surih of the Temple which God hath ordained to be the Mirror     of His Names between the heavens and the earth, and the Sign of His                Remembrance amidst the peoples of the world._                    He is the Most Wondrous, the All-Glorious!    1 Glorified is He Who hath revealed His verses to those who understand.  Glorified is He Who sendeth down His verses to those who perceive.  Glorified is He Who guideth whomsoever He pleaseth unto His path. Say: I,  verily, am the Path of God unto all who are in the heavens and all who are  on the earth; well is it with them that hasten thereunto!    2 Glorified is He Who sendeth down His verses to those who comprehend.  Glorified is He Who speaketh forth from the Kingdom of His Revelation, and  Who remaineth unknown to all save His honoured servants. Glorified is He  Who quickeneth whomsoever He willeth by virtue of His word \"Be\", and it  is! Glorified is He Who causeth whomsoever He willeth to ascend unto the  heaven of grace, and sendeth down therefrom whatsoever He desireth  according to a prescribed measure.    3 Blessed is He Who doeth as He willeth by a word of His command. He,  verily, is the True One, the Knower of things unseen. Blessed is He Who  inspireth whomsoever He willeth with whatsoever He desireth, through His  irresistible and inscrutable command. Blessed is He Who aideth whomsoever  He desireth with the hosts of the unseen. His might is, in truth, equal to  His purpose, and He, verily, is the All-Glorious, the Self-Subsisting.  Blessed is He Who exalteth whomsoever He willeth by the power of His  sovereign might, and confirmeth whomsoever He chooseth in accordance with  His good pleasure; well is it with them that understand!    4 Blessed is He Who, in a well-guarded Tablet, hath prescribed a fixed  measure unto all things. Blessed is He Who hath revealed unto His Servant  that which shall illumine the hearts and minds of men. Blessed is He Who  hath sent down upon His Servant such tribulations as have melted the  hearts of them that dwell within the Tabernacle of eternity and the souls  of those who have drawn nigh unto their Lord. Blessed is He Who hath  showered upon His Servant, from the clouds of His decree, the darts of  affliction, and Who beholdeth Me enduring them with patience and  fortitude. Blessed is He Who hath ordained for His Servant that which He  hath destined for no other soul. He, verily, is the One, the Incomparable,  the Self-Subsisting.    5 Blessed is He Who hath caused to rain down upon His Servant from the  clouds of enmity, and at the hands of the people of denial, the shafts of  tribulation and trial; and yet seeth Our heart filled with gratitude.  Blessed is He Who hath laid upon the shoulders of His Servant the burden  of the heavens and of the earth--a burden for which We yield Him every  praise, though none may grasp this save them that are endued with  understanding. Glorified is He Who hath surrendered the embodiment of His  Beauty to the clutches of the envious and the wicked--a fate unto which We  are fully resigned, though none may perceive this save those who are  endued with insight. Glorified is He Who hath left Husayn to make His  dwelling amidst the hosts of His enemies, and exposed His body with every  breath to the spears of hatred and anger; yet do We yield Him thanks for  all that He hath destined to befall His Servant Who repaireth unto Him in  His affliction and grief.    6 While engulfed in tribulations I heard a most wondrous, a most sweet  voice, calling above My head. Turning My face, I beheld a Maiden--the  embodiment of the remembrance of the name of My Lord--suspended in the air  before Me. So rejoiced was she in her very soul that her countenance shone  with the ornament of the good pleasure of God, and her cheeks glowed with  the brightness of the All-Merciful. Betwixt earth and heaven she was  raising a call which captivated the hearts and minds of men. She was  imparting to both My inward and outer being tidings which rejoiced My  soul, and the souls of God's honoured servants.    7 Pointing with her finger unto My head, she addressed all who are in  heaven and all who are on earth, saying: By God! This is the Best-Beloved  of the worlds, and yet ye comprehend not. This is the Beauty of God  amongst you, and the power of His sovereignty within you, could ye but  understand. This is the Mystery of God and His Treasure, the Cause of God  and His glory unto all who are in the kingdoms of Revelation and of  creation, if ye be of them that perceive. This is He Whose Presence is the  ardent desire of the denizens of the Realm of eternity, and of them that  dwell within the Tabernacle of glory, and yet from His Beauty do ye turn  aside.    8 O people of the Bayan! If ye aid Him not, God will assuredly assist Him  with the powers of earth and heaven, and sustain Him with the hosts of the  unseen through His command \"Be\", and it is! The day is approaching when  God will have, by an act of His Will, raised up a race of men the nature  of which is inscrutable to all save God, the All-Powerful, the  Self-Subsisting. He shall purify them from the defilement of idle fancies  and corrupt desires, shall lift them up to the heights of holiness, and  shall cause them to manifest the signs of His sovereignty and might upon  earth. Thus hath it been ordained by God, the All-Glorious, the  All-Loving.    9 O people of the Bayan! Would ye deny Him Whose presence is the very  object of your creation, while ye rejoice idly upon your couches? Would ye  laugh to scorn and contend with Him, a single hair of Whose head  excelleth, in the sight of God, all that are in the heavens and all that  are on the earth? O people of the Bayan! Produce, then, that which ye  possess, that I may know by what proof ye believed aforetime in the  Manifestations of His Cause, and by what reason ye now wax so disdainful!    10 I swear by Him Who hath fashioned Me from the light of His own Beauty!  None have I ever seen that surpasseth you in heedlessness or exceedeth you  in ignorance. Ye seek to prove your faith in God through such holy Tablets  as ye possess, yet when the verses of God were revealed and His Lamp was  lighted, ye disbelieved in Him Whose very Pen hath fixed the destinies of  all things in the Preserved Tablet. Ye recite the sacred verses and yet  repudiate Him Who is their Source and Revealer. Thus hath God blinded your  eyes in requital for your deeds, would ye but understand. Day and night ye  transcribe the verses of God, and yet ye remain shut out, as by a veil,  from Him Who hath revealed them.    11 In this Day the Concourse on high beholdeth you in your evil doings and  shunneth your company, and yet ye perceive it not. They ask of one  another: \"What words do these fools utter, and in what valley are they  wont to graze? Do they deny that whereunto their very souls testify, and  shut their eyes to that which they plainly behold?\" I swear by God, O  people! They that inhabit the Cities of the Names of God are bewildered at  your actions, while ye roam, aimless and unconscious, in a parched and  barren land.    12 O Pen of the Most High! Hearken unto the Call of Thy Lord, raised from  the Divine Lote-Tree in the holy and luminous Spot, that the sweet accents  of Thy Lord, the All-Merciful, may fill Thy soul with joy and fervour, and  that the breezes that waft from My name, the Ever-Forgiving, may dispel  Thy cares and sorrows. Raise up, then, from this Temple, the temples of  the Oneness of God, that they may tell out, in the kingdom of creation,  the tidings of their Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, and be of  them that are illumined by His light.    13 We, verily, have ordained this Temple to be the source of all existence  in the new creation, that all may know of a certainty My power to  accomplish that which I have purposed through My word \"Be\", and it is!  Beneath the shadow of every letter of this Temple We shall raise up a  people whose number none can reckon save God, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting. Erelong shall God bring forth from His Temple such souls  as will remain unswayed by the insinuations of the rebellious, and who  will quaff at all times of the cup that is life indeed. These, truly, are  of the blissful.    14 These are servants who abide beneath the shelter of the tender mercy of  their Lord, and who remain undeterred by those who seek to obstruct their  path. Upon their faces may be seen the brightness of the light of the  All-Merciful, and from their hearts may be heard the remembrance of Mine  all-glorious and inaccessible Name. Were they to unloose their tongues to  extol their Lord, the denizens of earth and heaven would join in their  anthems of praise--yet how few are they who hear! And were they to glorify  their Lord, all created things would join in their hymns of glory. Thus  hath God exalted them above the rest of His creation, and yet the people  remain unaware!    15 These are they who circle round the Cause of God even as the shadow  doth revolve around the sun. Open, then, your eyes, O people of the Bayan,  that haply ye may behold them! It is by virtue of their movement that all  things are set in motion, and by reason of their stillness all things are  brought to rest, would that ye might be assured thereof! Through them the  believers in the Divine Unity"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17310"],[0,"Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas (#2)"],[1,"  secluded themselves in their churches, calling upon the Spirit, but when  He appeared through the power of Truth, they failed to draw nigh unto Him  and are numbered with those that have gone far astray. Happy are they that  have abandoned them and set their faces towards Him Who is the Desire of  all that are in the heavens and all that are on the earth.    They read the Evangel and yet refuse to acknowledge the All-Glorious Lord,  notwithstanding that He hath come through the potency of His exalted, His  mighty and gracious dominion. We, verily, have come for your sakes, and  have borne the misfortunes of the world for your salvation. Flee ye the  One Who hath sacrificed His life that ye may be quickened? Fear God, O  followers of the Spirit, and walk not in the footsteps of every divine  that hath gone far astray. Do ye imagine that He seeketh His own  interests, when He hath, at all times, been threatened by the swords of  the enemies; or that He seeketh the vanities of the world, after He hath  been imprisoned in the most desolate of cities? Be fair in your judgement  and follow not the footsteps of the unjust.    Open the doors of your hearts. He Who is the Spirit verily standeth before  them. Wherefore keep ye afar from Him Who hath purposed to draw you nigh  unto a Resplendent Spot? Say: We, in truth, have opened unto you the gates  of the Kingdom. Will ye bar the doors of your houses in My face? This  indeed is naught but a grievous error. He, verily, hath again come down  from heaven, even as He came down from it the first time. Beware lest ye  dispute that which He proclaimeth, even as the people before you disputed  His utterances. Thus instructeth you the True One, could ye but perceive  it.    The river Jordan is joined to the Most Great Ocean, and the Son, in the  holy vale, crieth out: 'Here am I, here am I O Lord, my God!', whilst  Sinai circleth round the House, and the Burning Bush calleth aloud: 'He  Who is the Desired One is come in His transcendent majesty.' Say, Lo! The  Father is come, and that which ye were promised in the Kingdom is  fulfilled! This is the Word which the Son concealed, when to those around  Him He said: 'Ye cannot bear it now.' And when the appointed time was  fulfilled and the Hour had struck, the Word shone forth above the horizon  of the Will of God. Beware, O followers of the Son, that ye cast it not  behind your backs. Take ye fast hold of it. Better is this for you than  all that ye possess. Verily He is nigh unto them that do good. The Hour  which We had concealed from the knowledge of the peoples of the earth and  of the favoured angels hath come to pass. Say, verily, He hath testified  of Me, and I do testify of Him. Indeed, He hath purposed no one other than  Me. Unto this beareth witness every fair-minded and understanding soul.    Though beset with countless afflictions, We summon the people unto God,  the Lord of names. Say, strive ye to attain that which ye have been  promised in the Books of God, and walk not in the way of the ignorant. My  body hath endured imprisonment that ye may be released from the bondage of  self. Set your faces then towards His countenance and follow not the  footsteps of every hostile oppressor. Verily, He hath consented to be  sorely abased that ye may attain unto glory, and yet, ye are disporting  yourselves in the vale of heedlessness. He, in truth, liveth in the most  desolate of abodes for your sakes, whilst ye dwell in your palaces.    Say, did ye not hearken to the Voice of the Crier, calling aloud in the  wilderness of the Bayan, bearing unto you the glad-tidings of the coming  of your Lord, the All-Merciful? Lo! He is come in the sheltering shadow of  Testimony, invested with conclusive proof and evidence, and those who  truly believe in Him regard His presence as the embodiment of the Kingdom  of God. Blessed is the man who turneth towards Him, and woe betide such as  deny or doubt Him.    Announce thou unto the priests: Lo! He Who is the Ruler is come. Step out  from behind the veil in the name of thy Lord, He Who layeth low the necks  of all men. Proclaim then unto all mankind the glad-tidings of this  mighty, this glorious Revelation. Verily, He Who is the Spirit of Truth is  come to guide you unto all truth. He speaketh not as prompted by His own  self, but as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    Say, this is the One Who hath glorified the Son and hath exalted His  Cause. Cast away, O peoples of the earth, that which ye have and take fast  hold of that which ye are bidden by the All-Powerful, He Who is the Bearer  of the Trust of God. Purge ye your ears and set your hearts towards Him  that ye may hearken to the most wondrous Call which hath been raised from  Sinai, the habitation of your Lord, the Most Glorious. It will, in truth,  draw you nigh unto the Spot wherein ye will perceive the splendour of the  light of His countenance which shineth above this luminous Horizon.    O concourse of priests! Leave the bells, and come forth, then, from your  churches. It behoveth you, in this day, to proclaim aloud the Most Great  Name among the nations. Prefer ye to be silent, whilst every stone and  every tree shouteth aloud: 'The Lord is come in His great glory!'? Well is  it with the man who hasteneth unto Him. Verily, he is numbered among them  whose names will be eternally recorded and who will be mentioned by the  Concourse on High. Thus hath it been decreed by the Spirit in this  wondrous Tablet. He that summoneth men in My name is, verily, of Me, and  he will show forth that which is beyond the power of all that are on  earth. Follow ye the Way of the Lord and walk not in the footsteps of them  that are sunk in heedlessness. Well is it with the slumberer who is  stirred by the Breeze of God and ariseth from amongst the dead, directing  his steps towards the Way of the Lord. Verily, such a man is regarded, in  the sight of God, the True One, as a jewel amongst men and is reckoned  with the blissful.    Say: In the East the light of His Revelation hath broken; in the West have  appeared the signs of His dominion. Ponder this in your hearts, O people,  and be not of those who have turned a deaf ear to the admonitions of Him  Who is the Almighty, the All-Praised. Let the Breeze of God awaken you.  Verily, it hath wafted over the world. Well is it with him that hath  discovered the fragrance thereof and been accounted among the  well-assured.    O concourse of bishops! Ye are the stars of the heaven of My knowledge. My  mercy desireth not that ye should fall upon the earth. My justice,  however, declareth: 'This is that which the Son hath decreed.' And  whatsoever hath proceeded out of His blameless, His truth-speaking,  trustworthy mouth, can never be altered. The bells, verily, peal out My  Name, and lament over Me, but My spirit rejoiceth with evident gladness.  The body of the Loved One yearneth for the cross, and His head is eager  for the spear, in the path of the All-Merciful. The ascendancy of the  oppressor can in no wise deter Him from His purpose. We have summoned all  created things to attain the presence of thy Lord, the King of all names.  Blessed is the man that hath set his face towards God, the Lord of the Day  of Reckoning.    O concourse of monks! If ye choose to follow Me, I will make you heirs of  My Kingdom; and if ye transgress against Me, I will, in My long-suffering,  endure it patiently, and I, verily, am the Ever-Forgiving, the  All-Merciful.    O land of Syria! What hath become of thy righteousness? Thou art, in  truth, ennobled by the footsteps of thy Lord. Hast thou perceived the  fragrance of heavenly reunion, or art thou to be accounted of the  heedless?    Bethlehem is astir with the Breeze of God. We hear her voice saying: 'O  most generous Lord! Where is Thy great glory established? The sweet  savours of Thy presence have quickened me, after I had melted in my  separation from Thee. Praised be Thou in that Thou hast raised the veils,  and come with power in evident glory.' We called unto her from behind the  Tabernacle of Majesty and Grandeur: 'O Bethlehem! This Light hath risen in  the orient, and travelled towards the occident, until it reached thee in  the evening of its life. Tell Me then: Do the sons recognize the Father,  and acknowledge Him, or do they deny Him, even as the people aforetime  denied Him (Jesus)?' Whereupon she cried out saying: 'Thou art, in truth,  the All-Knowing, the Best-Informed.' Verily, We behold all created things  moved to bear witness unto Us. Some know Us and bear witness, while the  majority bear witness, yet know Us not.    Mount Sinai is astir with the joy of beholding Our countenance. She hath  lifted her enthralling voice in glorification of her Lord, saying: 'O  Lord! I sense the fragrance of Thy garment. Methinks Thou art near,  invested with the signs of God. Thou hast ennobled these regions with Thy  footsteps. Great is the blessedness of Thy people, could they but know  Thee and inhale Thy sweet savours; and woe betide them that are fast  asleep.'    Happy art thou who hast turned thy face towards My countenance, inasmuch  as thou hast rent the veils asunder, hast shattered the idols and  recognized thine eternal Lord. The people of the Qur'an have risen up  against Us without any clear proof or evidence, tormenting Us at every  moment with a fresh torment. They idly imagine that tribulations can  frustrate Our Purpose. Vain indeed is that which they have imagined.  Verily, thy Lord is the One Who ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth.    I never passed a tree but Mine heart addressed it saying: 'O would that  thou wert cut down in My name, and My body crucified upon thee.' We  revealed this passage in the Epistle to the Shah that it might serve as a  warning to the followers of religions. Verily, thy Lord is the  All-Knowing, the All-Wise.    Let not the things they have perpetrated grieve thee. Truly they are even  as dead, "]]]
