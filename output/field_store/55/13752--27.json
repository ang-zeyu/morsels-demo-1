The sinking of the British passenger steamer Falaba by a German  submarine on March 28, through which Leon C. Thrasher, an American  citizen, was drowned; the attack on April 28 on the American vessel  Cushing by a German aeroplane; the torpedoing on May 1 of the American  vessel Gulflight by a German submarine, as a result of which two or more  American citizens met their death; and, finally, the torpedoing and  sinking of the steamship Lusitania, constitute a series of events which  the Government of the United States has observed with growing concern,  distress, and amazement.    Recalling the humane and enlightened attitude hitherto assumed by the  Imperial German Government in matters of international right, and  particularly with regard to the freedom of the seas; having learned to  recognize the German views and the German influence in the field of  international obligation as always engaged upon the side of justice and  humanity; and having understood the instructions of the Imperial German  Government to its naval commanders to be upon the same plane of humane  action prescribed by the naval codes of other nations, the Government of  the United States was loath to believe--it cannot now bring itself to  believe--that these acts, so absolutely contrary to the rules, the  practices, and the spirit of modern warfare, could have the countenance  or sanction of that great Government. It feels it to be its duty,  therefore, to address the Imperial German Government concerning them  with the utmost frankness and in the earnest hope that it is not  mistaken in expecting action on the part of the Imperial German  Government which will correct the unfortunate impressions which have  been created, and vindicate once more the position of that Government  with regard to the sacred freedom of the seas.    The Government of the United States has been apprised that the Imperial  German Government considered themselves to be obliged by the  extraordinary circumstances of the present war and the measures adopted  by their adversaries in seeking to cut Germany off from all commerce, to  adopt methods of retaliation which go much beyond the ordinary methods  of warfare at sea, in the proclamation of a war zone from which they  have warned neutral ships to keep away. This Government has already  taken occasion to inform the Imperial German Government that it cannot  admit the adoption of such measures or such a warning of danger to  operate as in any degree an abbreviation of the rights of American  shipmasters or of American citizens bound on lawful errands as  passengers on merchant ships of belligerent nationality, and that it  must hold the Imperial German Government to a strict accountability for  any infringement of those rights, intentional or incidental. It does not  understand the Imperial German Government to question those rights. It  assumes, on the contrary, that the Imperial Government accept, as of  course, the rule that the lives of noncombatants, whether they be of  neutral citizenship or citizens of one of the nations at war, cannot  lawfully or rightfully be put in jeopardy by the capture or destruction  of an unarmed merchantman, and recognize also, as all other nations do,  the obligation to take the usual precaution of visit and search to  ascertain whether a suspected merchantman is in fact of belligerent  nationality or is in fact carrying contraband of war under a neutral  flag.    The Government of the United States, therefore, desires to call the  attention of the Imperial German Government with the utmost earnestness  to the fact that the objection to their present method of attack against  the trade of their enemies lies in the practical impossibility of  employing submarines in the destruction of commerce without disregarding  those rules of fairness, reason, justice, and humanity which all modern  opinion regards as imperative. It is practically impossible for the  officers of a submarine to visit a merchantman at sea and examine her  papers and cargo. It is practically impossible for them to make a prize  of her; and, if they cannot put a prize crew on board of her, they  cannot sink her without leaving her crew and all on board of her to the  mercy of the sea in her small boats. These facts it is understood the  Imperial German Government frankly admit. We are informed that in the  instances of which we have spoken time enough for even that poor measure  of safety was not given, and in at least two of the cases cited not so  much as a warning was received. Manifestly, submarines cannot be used  against merchantmen, as the last few weeks have shown, without an  inevitable violation of many sacred principles of justice and humanity.    American citizens act within their indisputable rights in taking their  ships and in traveling wherever their legitimate business calls them  upon the high seas, and exercise those rights in what should be the  well-justified confidence that their lives will not be endangered by  acts done in clear violation of universally acknowledged international  obligations, and certainly in the confidence that their own Government  will sustain them in the exercise of their rights.    There was recently published in the newspapers of the United States, I  regret to inform the Imperial German Government, a formal warning,  purporting to come from the Imperial German Embassy at Washington,  addressed to the people of the United States, and stating, in effect,  that any citizen of the United States who exercised his right of free  travel upon the seas would do so at his peril if his journey should take  him within the zone of waters within which the Imperial German Navy was  using submarines against the commerce of Great Britain and France,  notwithstanding the respectful but very earnest protest of his  Government, the Government of the United States. I do not refer to this  for the purpose of calling the attention of the Imperial German  Government at this time to the surprising irregularity of a  communication from the Imperial German Embassy at Washington addressed  to the people of the United States through the newspapers, but only for  the purpose of pointing out that no warning that an unlawful and  inhumane act will be committed can possibly be accepted as an excuse or  palliation for that act or as an abatement of the responsibility for its  commission.    Long acquainted as this Government has been with the character of the  Imperial Government, and with the high principles of equity by which  they have in the past been actuated and guided, the Government of the  United States cannot believe that the commanders of the vessels which  committed these acts of lawlessness did so except under a  misapprehension of the orders issued by the Imperial German naval  authorities. It takes it for granted that, at least within the practical  possibilities of every such case, the commanders even of submarines were  expected to do nothing that would involve the lives of noncombatants or  the safety of neutral ships, even at the cost of failing of their object  of capture or destruction. It confidently expects, therefore, that the  Imperial German Government will disavow the acts of which the Government  of the United States complains; that they will make reparation so far as  reparation is possible for injuries which are without measure, and that  they will take immediate steps to prevent the recurrence of anything so  obviously subversive of the principles of warfare for which the Imperial  German Government have in the past so wisely and so firmly contended.    The Government and people of the United States look to the Imperial  German Government for just, prompt, and enlightened action in this vital  matter with the greater confidence, because the United States and  Germany are bound together not only by special ties of friendship, but  also by the explicit stipulations of the Treaty of 1828, between the  United States and the Kingdom of Prussia.    Expressions of regret and offers of reparation in case of the  destruction of neutral ships sunk by mistake, while they may satisfy  international obligations, if no loss of life results, cannot justify or  excuse a practice the natural and necessary effect of which is to  subject neutral nations and neutral persons to new and immeasurable  risks.    The Imperial German Government will not expect the Government of the  United States to omit any word or any act necessary to the performance  of its sacred duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and  its citizens and of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.    BRYAN.          THE WARNING AND THE CONSEQUENCE--      THE GERMAN WARNING.    [On Saturday, May 1, the day that the Lusitania left New York on her  last voyage, the following advertisement bearing the authentication of  the German Embassy at Washington appeared in the chief newspapers of the  United States, placed next the advertisement of the Cunard Line:         NOTICE!         TRAVELLERS intending to embark on the Atlantic voyage are       reminded that a state of war exists between Germany and her       allies and Great Britain and her allies; that the zone of war       includes the waters adjacent to the British Isles; that, in       accordance with formal notice given by the Imperial German       Government vessels flying the flag of Great Britain, or of any       of her allies, are liable to destruction in those waters and       that travellers sailing in the war zone on ships of Great       Britain or her allies do so at their own risk.

EDITOR'S PREFACE (1893)[1]      The _Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official_, always a  costly book, has been scarce and difficult to procure for many years  past. Among the crowd of books descriptive of Indian scenery,  manners, and customs, the sterling merits of Sir William Sleeman's  work have secured it pre-eminence, and kept it in constant demand,  notwithstanding the lapse of nearly fifty years since its  publication. The high reputation of this work does not rest upon its  strictly literary qualities. The author was a busy man, immersed all  his life in the practical affairs of administration, and too full of  his subject to be careful of strict correctness of style or minute  accuracy of expression. Yet, so great is the intrinsic value of his  observations, and so attractive are the sincerity and sympathy with  which he discusses a vast range of topics, that the reader refuses to  be offended by slight formal defects in expression or arrangement,  and willingly yields to the charm of the author's genial and  unstudied conversation.    It would be difficult to name any other book so full of instruction  for the young Anglo-Indian administrator. When this work was  published in 1844 the author had had thirty-five years' varied  experience of Indian life, and had accumulated and assimilated an  immense store of knowledge concerning the history, manners, and modes  of thought of the complex population of India. He thoroughly  understood the peculiarities of the various native races, and the  characteristics which distinguish them from the nations of Europe;  while his sympathetic insight into Indian life had not orientalized  him, nor had it ever for one moment caused him to forget his position  and heritage as an Englishman. This attitude of sane and  discriminating sympathy is the right attitude for the Englishman in  India.    To enumerate the topics on which wise and profitable observations  will be found in this book would be superfluous. The wine is good,  and needs no bush. So much may be said that the book is one to  interest that nondescript person, the general reader in Europe or  America, as well as the Anglo-Indian official. Besides good advice  and sound teaching on matters of policy and administration, it  contains many charming, though inartificial, descriptions of scenery  and customs, many ingenious speculations, and some capital stories.  The ethnologist, the antiquary, the geologist, the soldier, and the  missionary will all find in it something to suit their several  tastes.    In this edition the numerous misprints of the original edition have  been all, and, for the most part, silently corrected. The extremely  erratic punctuation has been freely modified, and the spelling of  Indian words and names has been systematized. Two paragraphs,  misplaced in the original edition at the end of Chapter 48 of Volume  I, have been removed, and inserted in their proper place at the end  of Chapter 47; and the supplementary notes printed at the end of the  second volume of the original edition have been brought up to the  positions which they were intended to occupy. Chapters 37 to 46 of  the first volume, describing the contest for empire between the sons  of Shah Jahan, are in substance only a free version of Bernier's work  entitled, _The Late Revolution of the Empire of the Great Mogol_.  These chapters have not been reprinted because the history of that  revolution can now be read much more satisfactorily in Mr.  Constable's edition of Bernier's Travels. Except as above stated, the  text of the present edition of the Rambles and Recollections is a  faithful reprint of the Author's text.    In the spelling of names and other words of Oriental languages the  Editor has 'endeavoured to strike a mean between popular usage and  academic precision, preferring to incur the charge of looseness to  that of pedantry'. Diacritical marks intended to distinguish between  the various sibilants, dentals, nasals, and so forth, of the Arabic  and Sanskrit alphabets, have been purposely omitted. Long vowels are  marked by the sign ^. Except in a few familiar words, such as  Nerbudda and Hindoo, which are spelled in the traditional manner,  vowels are to be pronounced as in Italian, or as in the following  English examples, namely: a, as in 'call'; e, or e, as the medial  vowel in 'cake'; i, as in 'kill'; i, as the medial vowels in 'keel';  u, as in 'full'; u, as the medial vowels in 'fool'; o, or o, as in  'bone'; ai, or ai, as 'eye' or 'aye', respectively; and au, as the  medial sound in 'fowl'. Short a, with stress, is pronounced like the  u in 'but'; and if without stress, as an indistinct vowel, like the A  in 'America'.    The Editor's notes, being designed merely to explain and illustrate  the text, so as to render the book fully intelligible and helpful to  readers of the present day, have been compressed into the narrowest  possible limits. Even India changes, and observations and criticisms  which were perfectly true when recorded can no longer be safely  applied without explanation to the India of to-day. The Author's few  notes are distinguished by his initials.    A copious analytical index has been compiled. The bibliography is as  complete as careful inquiry could make it, but it is possible that  some anonymous papers by the Author, published in periodicals, may  have escaped notice.    The memoir of Sir William Sleeman is based on the slight sketch  prefixed to the _Journey through the Kingdom of Oude_, supplemented  by much additional matter derived from his published works and  correspondence, as well as from his unpublished letters and other  papers generously communicated by his only son, Captain Henry  Sleeman. Ample materials exist for a full account of Sir William  Sleeman's noble and interesting life, which well deserves to be  recorded in detail; but the necessary limitations of these volumes  preclude the Editor from making free use of the biographical matter  at his command.    The reproduction of the twenty-four coloured plates of varying merit  which enrich the original edition has not been considered desirable.  The map shows clearly the route taken by the Author in the journey  the description of which is the leading theme of the book.          EDITOR'S PREFACE (1915)    My edition published by Archibald Constable and Company in 1893 being  out of print but still in demand, Mr. Humphrey Milford, the present  owner of the copyright, has requested me to revise the book and bring  it up to date.    This new edition is issued uniform with Mr. Beauchamp's third edition  of _Hindu Manners, Customs, and Ceremonies_ by the Abbe J. A. Dubois  (Oxford: at the Clarendon Press, 1906), a work bearing a strong  resemblance in substance to the _Rambles and Recollections_, and,  also like Sleeman's book in that it 'is as valuable to-day as ever it  was--even more valuable in some respects'.    The labour of revision has proved to be far more onerous than was  expected. In the course of twenty-one years the numerous changes  which have occurred in India, not only in administrative  arrangements, but of various other kinds, necessitate the emendation  of notes which, although accurate when written, no longer agree with  existing facts. The appearance of many new books and improved  editions involves changes in a multitude of references. Such  alterations are most considerable in the annotations dealing with the  buildings at Agra, Sikandara, Fathpur-Sikri, and Delhi, and the  connected political history, concerning which much new information is  now available. Certain small misstatements of fact in my old notes  have been put right. Some of those errors which escaped the notice of  critics have been detected by me, and some have been rectified by the  aid of criticisms received from Sir George Grierson, C.I.E., Mr.  William Crooke, sometime President of the Folklore Society, and other  kind correspondents, to all of whom I am grateful. Naturally, the  opportunity has been taken to revise the wording throughout and to  eliminate misprints and typographical defects. The Index has been  recast so as to suit the changed paging and to include the new  matter.    Captain James Lewis Sleeman of the Royal Sussex Regiment has been  good enough to permit the reproduction of his grandfather's portrait,  and has communicated papers which have enabled me to make corrections  in and additions to the Memoir, largely enhancing the interest and  value of that section of the book.    Notes:    1. Certain small changes have been made.      MEMOIR  OF  MAJ.-GEN. SIR WILLIAM HENRY SLEEMAN, K.C.B.    The Sleemans, an ancient Cornish family, for several generations  owned the estate of Pool Park in the parish of Saint Judy, in the  county of Cornwall. Captain Philip Sleeman, who married Mary Spry, a  member of a distinguished family in the same county, was stationed at  Stratton, in Cornwall, on August 8, 1788, when his son William Henry  was born.    In 1809, at the age of twenty-one, William Henry Sleeman was  nominated, through the good offices of Lord De Dunstanville, to an  Infantry Cadetship in the Bengal army. On the 24th of March, in the  same year, he sailed from Gravesend in the ship Devonshire, and,  having touched at Madeira and"]]]
