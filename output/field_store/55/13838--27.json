The knowledge thus obtained was of great service to him, for after a  while he became not only conversant with the life of a mariner, but also  with the science of geography and of astronomy. When Samuel Champlain  was about twenty years of age, he tendered his services to Marshal  d'Aumont, one of the chief commanders of the Catholic army in its  expedition against the Huguenots.    When the League had done its work and the army was disbanded in 1598,  Champlain returned to Brouage, and sought a favourable opportunity to  advance his fortune in a manner more agreeable, if possible, to his  tastes, and more compatible with his abilities. In the meantime  Champlain did not remain idle, for he resolved to find the means of  making a voyage to Spain in order \"to acquire and cultivate  acquaintance, and make a true report to His Majesty (Henry IV) of the  particularities which could not be known to any Frenchmen, for the  reason that they have not free access there.\" He left Blavet at the  beginning of the month of August, and ten days after he arrived near  Cape Finisterre. Having remained for six days at the Isle of Bayona, in  Galicia, he proceeded towards San Lucar de Barameda, which is at the  mouth of the river Seville, where he remained for three months. During  this time he went to Seville and made surveys of the place. While  Champlain was at Seville, a _patache_, or advice boat, arrived from  Porto Rico bearing a communication addressed to the king of Spain,  informing him that a portion of the English army had put out to sea with  the intention of attacking Porto Rico.    The king fitted out twenty ships to oppose the English, one of which,  the _Saint Julien_, was commanded by Provencal, Champlain's uncle.  Champlain proposed to join the expedition under his uncle, but Provencal  was ordered elsewhere, and General Soubriago offered the command of the  _Saint Julien_ to Champlain, which he gladly accepted.    The armada set sail in the beginning of January, 1599, and within six  days, favoured by a fresh breeze, the vessels sighted the Canary  Islands. Two months and six days later the armada drew near to the  island called La Desirade, which is the first island approached in this  passage to the Indies. The ships anchored for the first time at Nacou,  which is one of the finest ports of the Guadeloupe. After having passed  Marguerite Island and the Virgins, Champlain proceeded to San Juan de  Porto Rico,[1] where he found that both the town and the castle or  fortress had been abandoned, and that the merchants had either made  their escape or had been taken prisoners. The English army had left the  town and had taken the Spanish governor with them, as he had surrendered  on the condition that his life should be spared.    On leaving Porto Rico the general divided the galleons into three  squadrons, and retained four vessels under his own command. Three were  sent to Porto Bello, and three, including Champlain's vessel, to New  Spain. Champlain arrived at Saint Jean de Luz eight days afterwards,  although the place is fully four hundred leagues from Porto Rico. This  fortress bore the name of San Juan d'Ulloa. Fifteen days afterwards we  find Champlain setting sail for Mexico, situated at a distance of over  one hundred leagues from San Juan.    Champlain was evidently very much interested in this country, and his  description is that of an enthusiast: \"It is impossible to see or desire  a more beautiful country than this kingdom of New Spain, which is three  hundred leagues in length, and two hundred in breadth.... The whole of  this country is ornamented with very fine rivers and streams ... the  land is very fertile, producing corn twice in the year ... the trees are  never devoid of fruit and are always green.\" The voyage to Mexico  occupied a month, and Champlain gave an animated description of the city  of Mexico, of its superb palaces, temples, houses and buildings, and  well laid streets, as well as of the surrounding country.    After leaving Mexico, Champlain returned to San Juan de Luz, and from  there sailed in a _patache_ to Porto Bello, \"the most pitiful and evil  residence in the world.\" The harbour, however, was good, and well  fortified. From Porto Bello to Panama, which is on the sea, the distance  is only seventeen leagues, and it is interesting to read Champlain's  description:--    \"One may judge that if the four leagues of land which there are from  Panama to this river were cut through, one might pass from the South  Sea to the ocean on the other side, and thus shorten the route by more  than fifteen hundred leagues; and from Panama to the Straits of Magellan  would be an island, and from Panama to the New-found-lands would be  another island, so that the whole of America would be in two islands.\"    It is thus seen that the idea of connecting the Atlantic ocean with the  Pacific by cutting through the Isthmus of Panama is not a modern one, as  it was promulgated by Champlain over three hundred years ago.    At this time Spain was in great need of a good transportation service at  the isthmus. The treasures of Peru were sent to Europe by the Panama  route to Porto Bello, from where the ships sailed to the old continent.  The route between the Pacific coast and the Gulf of Mexico was  exceedingly bad. Sometimes the merchants forwarded European goods to  Panama, having them transported to Chagres. Here they were landed in  boats and conveyed to Cruces. From Cruces to Panama mules were employed  for the remainder of the journey. It was, however, the route taken by  travellers visiting Peru, Chili, New Granada, Venezuela, and other  Spanish possessions on the Pacific coast. The most regular connection  between the two oceans was from Fort Acapulco to Vera Cruz, through  Mexico. If Spain had adopted a better line of communication with her  western territories in the New World she might have derived vast  treasure from that source. In the year 1551 Lopez de Gomara, the author  of a \"History of Indies,\" a work written with care and displaying  considerable erudition, proposed to unite the two oceans by means of  canals at three different points, Chagres, Nicaragua and Tehuantepec.  Gomara's proposals were not acted upon, and the honour of carrying out  the project was reserved for France. Ferdinand de Lesseps, who succeeded  in connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, was the man who,  after the lapse of centuries, seriously interested his fellow-countrymen  in boring the Isthmus of Panama.    Champlain returned to San Juan de Luz, where he remained for fifteen  days, and he then proceeded to Havana, the rendezvous of the army and of  the fleet. Eighteen days later he embarked in a vessel bound for  Cartagena, where there was a good port, sheltered from all winds. Upon  his return to Havana Champlain met his general and spent four months in  collecting valuable information relating to the interesting island of  Cuba. From Havana he proceeded past the Bahama channel, approached  Bermuda Island, Terceira, one of the Azores, and sighted Cape St.  Vincent, where he captured two armed English vessels, which were taken  to Seville.    Champlain returned to France in March, 1601, having been absent on his  first voyage for a period of two years and two months, during which time  he collected much valuable information. He also published a small  volume containing plans, maps and engravings, fairly well executed for  the time, and now exceedingly scarce. The manuscript of this volume is  still preserved; it covers one hundred and fifteen pages with sixty-two  drawings, coloured and surrounded with blue and yellow lines. It appears  to have been written between the years 1601 and 1603.[2]    The first voyage of Champlain across the Atlantic, though important from  a military standpoint, did not suffice to satisfy the ambition of a man  whose thoughts were bent upon discovery and colonization. Champlain was  a navigator by instinct, and in his writings he gave to nautical science  the first place.    \"Of all the most useful and excellent arts,\" he writes, \"that of  navigation has always seemed to me to occupy the first place. For the  more hazardous it is, the greater the perils and losses by which it is  attended, so much the more is it esteemed and exalted above all others,  being wholly unsuited to the timid and irresolute. By this art we obtain  a knowledge of different countries, regions and realms. By it we  attract and bring to our own land all kinds of riches; by it the  idolatry of Paganism is overthrown and Christianity proclaimed  throughout all the regions of the earth. This is the art which won my  love in my early years and induced me to expose myself almost all my  life to the impetuous waves of the ocean, and led me to explore the  coasts of a portion of America, especially those of New France, where I  have always desired to see the lily flourish, together with the only  religion, Catholic, Apostolic and Roman.\"    After his return to France in the year 1601, Champlain received a  pension, together with the appointment of geographer to the king. Pierre  de Chauvin, Sieur de Tontuit, who had unsuccessfully endeavoured to  establish a settlement at Tadousac, died at this time, while Champlain  was residing in Paris. Here he had the good fortune to meet Aymar de  Chastes, governor of the town and chateau of Dieppe, under whose orders  he had served during the latter years of the war with the League.    De Chastes, who had resolved to undertake the colonization of Canada,  obtained a commission from the king, and formed a company, composed of  several gentlemen and the principal merchants of Rouen. Francois Grave,  Sieur du Pont, who had already accompanied Chauvin to Tadousac, was  chosen to return there and to examine the Sault St. Louis and the  country beyond.    \"Going from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17144"],[0,"The House of the Vampire (#2)"],[1,"thrill, that redeemed the execrable  faultiness of her singing, and brought the rude audience under her  spell.    Clarke, too, was captivated by that tremour, the infinite sadness of  which suggested the plaint of souls moaning low at night, when lust  preys on creatures marked for its spoil.    The singer paused. Still those luminous eyes were upon her. She grew  nervous. It was only with tremendous difficulty that she reached the  refrain. As she sang the opening lines of the last stanza, an  inscrutable smile curled on Clarke's lips. She noticed the man's  relentless gaze and faltered. When the burden came, her singing was hard  and cracked: the tremour had gone from her voice.          III      Long before the appointed time Ernest walked up and down in front of the  abode of Reginald Clarke, a stately apartment-house overlooking  Riverside Drive.    Misshapen automobiles were chasing by, carrying to the cool river's  marge the restlessness and the fever of American life. But the bustle  and the noise seemed to the boy only auspicious omens of the future.    Jack, his room-mate and dearest friend, had left him a month ago, and,  for a space, he had felt very lonely. His young and delicate soul found  it difficult to grapple with the vague fears that his nervous brain  engendered, when whispered sounds seemed to float from hidden corners,  and the stairs creaked under mysterious feet.    He needed the voice of loving kindness to call him back from the valley  of haunting shadows, where his poet's soul was wont to linger overlong;  in his hours of weakness the light caress of a comrade renewed his  strength and rekindled in his hand the flaming sword of song.    And at nightfall he would bring the day's harvest to Clarke, as a  worshipper scattering precious stones, incense and tapestries at the  feet of a god.    Surely he would be very happy. And as the heart, at times, leads the  feet to the goal of its desire, while multicoloured dreams, like  dancing-girls, lull the will to sleep, he suddenly found himself  stepping from the elevator-car to Reginald Clarke's apartment.    Already was he raising his hand to strike the electric bell when a sound  from within made him pause half-way.    \"No, there's no help!\" he heard Clarke say. His voice had a hard,  metallic clangour.    A boyish voice answered plaintively. What the words were Ernest could  not distinctly hear, but the suppressed sob in them almost brought the  tears to his eyes. He instinctively knew that this was the finale of  some tragedy.    He withdrew hastily, so as not to be a witness of an interview that was  not meant for his ears.    Reginald Clarke probably had good reason for parting with his young  friend, whom Ernest surmised to be Abel Felton, a talented boy, whom the  master had taken under his wings.    In the apartment a momentary silence had ensued.    This was interrupted by Clarke: \"It will come again, in a month, in a  year, in two years.\"    \"No, no! It is all gone!\" sobbed the boy.    \"Nonsense. You are merely nervous. But that is just why we must part.  There is no room in one house for two nervous people.\"    \"I was not such a nervous wreck before I met you.\"    \"Am I to blame for it--for your morbid fancies, your extravagance, the  slow tread of a nervous disease, perhaps?\"    \"Who can tell? But I am all confused. I don't know what I am saying.  Everything is so puzzling--life, friendship, you. I fancied you cared  for my career, and now you end our friendship without a thought!\"    \"We must all follow the law of our being.\"    \"The laws are within us and in our control.\"    \"They are within us and beyond us. It is the physiological structure of  our brains, our nerve-cells, that makes and mars our lives.    \"Our mental companionship was so beautiful. It was meant to last.\"    \"That is the dream of youth. Nothing lasts. Everything flows--panta rei.  We are all but sojourners in an inn. Friendship, as love, is an  illusion. Life has nothing to take from a man who has no illusions.\"    \"It has nothing to give him.\"    They said good-bye.    At the door Ernest met Abel.    \"Where are you going?\" he asked.    \"For a little pleasure trip.\"    Ernest knew that the boy lied.    He remembered that Abel Felton was at work upon some book, a play or a  novel. It occurred to him to inquire how far he had progressed with it.    Abel smiled sadly. \"I am not writing it.\"    \"Not writing it?\"    \"Reginald is.\"    \"I am afraid I don't understand.\"    \"Never mind. Some day you will.\"          IV      \"I am so happy you came,\" Reginald Clarke said, as he conducted Ernest  into his studio. It was a large, luxuriously furnished room overlooking  the Hudson and Riverside Drive.    Dazzled and bewildered, the boy's eyes wandered from object to object,  from picture to statue. Despite seemingly incongruous details, the whole  arrangement possessed style and distinction.    A satyr on the mantelpiece whispered obscene secrets into the ears of  Saint Cecilia. The argent limbs of Antinous brushed against the garments  of Mona Lisa. And from a corner a little rococo lady peered coquettishly  at the gray image of an Egyptian sphinx. There was a picture of Napoleon  facing the image of the Crucified. Above all, in the semi-darkness,  artificially produced by heavy draperies, towered two busts.    \"Shakespeare and Balzac!\" Ernest exclaimed with some surprise.    \"Yes,\" explained Reginald, \"they are my gods.\"    His gods! Surely there was a key to Clarke's character. Our gods are  ourselves raised to the highest power.    Clarke and Shakespeare!    Even to Ernest's admiring mind it seemed almost blasphemous to name a  contemporary, however esteemed, in one breath with the mighty master of  song, whose great gaunt shadow, thrown against the background of the  years has assumed immense, unproportionate, monstrous dimensions.    Yet something might be said for the comparison. Clarke undoubtedly was  universally broad, and undoubtedly concealed, with no less exquisite  taste than the Elizabethan, his own personality under the splendid  raiment of his art. They certainly were affinities. It would not have  been surprising to him to see the clear calm head of Shakespeare rise  from behind his host.    Perhaps--who knows?--the very presence of the bust in his room had, to  some extent, subtly and secretly moulded Reginald Clarke's life. A man's  soul, like the chameleon, takes colour from its environment. Even  comparative trifles, the number of the house in which we live, or the  colour of the wallpaper of a room, may determine a destiny.    The boy's eyes were again surveying the fantastic surroundings in which  he found himself; while, from a corner, Clarke's eyes were watching his  every movement, as if to follow his thoughts into the innermost  labyrinth of the mind. It seemed to Ernest, under the spell of this  passing fancy, as though each vase, each picture, each curio in the  room, was reflected in Clarke's work. In a long-queued, porcelain  Chinese mandarin he distinctly recognised a quaint quatrain in one of  Clarke's most marvellous poems. And he could have sworn that the grin of  the Hindu monkey-god on the writing-table reappeared in the weird rhythm  of two stanzas whose grotesque cadence had haunted him for years.    At last Clarke broke the silence. \"You like my studio?\" he asked.    The simple question brought Ernest back to reality.    \"Like it? Why, it's stunning. It set up in me the queerest train of  thought.\"    \"I, too, have been in a whimsical mood to-night. Fancy, unlike genius,  is an infectious disease.\"    \"What is the peculiar form it assumed in your case?\"    \"I have been wondering whether all the things that environ us day by day  are, in a measure, fashioning our thought-life. I sometimes think that  even my little mandarin and this monkey-idol which, by the way, I  brought from India, are exerting a mysterious but none the less real  influence upon my work.\"    \"Great God!\" Ernest replied, \"I have had the identical thought!\"    \"How very strange!\" Clarke exclaimed, with seeming surprise.    \"It is said tritely but truly, that great minds travel the same roads,\"  Ernest observed, inwardly pleased.    \"No,\" the older man subtly remarked, \"but they reach the same  conclusion by a different route.\"    \"And you attach serious importance to our fancy?\"    \"Why not?\"    Clarke was gazing abstractedly at the bust of Balzac.    \"A man's genius is commensurate with his ability of absorbing from life  the elements essential to his artistic completion. Balzac possessed this  power in a remarkable degree. But, strange to say, it was evil that  attracted him most. He absorbed it as a sponge absorbs water; perhaps  because there was so little of it in his own make-up. He must have  purified the atmosphere around him for miles, by bringing all the evil  that was floating in the air or slumbering in men's souls to the point  of his pen.    \"And he\"--his eyes were resting on Shakespeare's features as a man might  look upon the face of a brother--\"he, too, was such a nature. In fact,  he was the most perfect type of the artist. Nothing escaped his mind.  From life and from books he drew his material, each time reshaping it  with a master-hand. Creation is a divine prerogative. Re-creation,  infinitely more wonderful than mere calling into existence, is the  prerogative of the poet. Shakespeare took his colours from many  palettes. That is why he is so great, and why his work is incredibly  greater than he. It alone explains his unique achievement. Who was he?  What education did he have, what opportunities? None. And yet we find in  his work the wisdom of Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh's fancies and  discoveries, Marlowe's verbal thunders and the mysterious loveliness of  Mr. W.H.\"    Ernest listened, entranced by the sound of Clarke's mellifluous voice.  He was, indeed, a master of the spoken word, and possessed a miraculous  power of giving to the"]]]
