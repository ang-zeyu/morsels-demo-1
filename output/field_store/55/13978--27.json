The use of a reversed capital in place of a base for the centre column  is also a peculiar treatment frequently found in Romanesque work.          [Illustration: XXVIII. Windows in the Facade of S. Gregorio, Bari,  Italy.]      XXVIII.    WINDOWS IN THE FACADE OF S. GREGORIO, BARI, ITALY.          [Illustration: XXIX. Triforium Window in the Church of S. Gregorio,  Bari, Italy.]      XXIX.    TRIFORIUM WINDOW IN THE CHURCH OF S. GREGORIO, BARI, ITALY.    The Byzantine architects used pierced stonework with great effect both  in exterior and interior detail. The examples here shown are rather  crude, but effective in the relative scale of parts.          [Illustration: XXX. Window in the Apse of the Cathedral, Bari, Italy.]      XXX.    WINDOW IN THE APSE OF THE CATHEDRAL, BARI, ITALY.    The ornament about this window, especially that in the long panel below  it and upon the cyma of the soffit above, is Byzantine in character,  while the columns, with the exception of the capital of the one at the  left, are much more Romanesque.          [Illustration: XXXI. A Window in Bittonto, Italy.]      XXXI.    A WINDOW IN BITTONTO, ITALY.    This is not an especially beautiful example, but is an illustration of  the direct and vigorous treatment of the early barbarian Romanesque  builders.          [Illustration: XXXII. Window in the Apse of the Cathedral, Bittonto,  Italy.]      XXXII.    WINDOW IN THE APSE OF THE CATHEDRAL, BITTONTO, ITALY.    In this case the beautiful and delicate Byzantine leafage can be seen on  the mouldings of the arch above the window. As in several of the  preceding examples, there is a curious mixture of the two styles.          The Brochure Series    of Architectural Illustration.

Cass Gilbert, George B. Post, and Frank Miles Day,  have awarded the scholarship to William S. Aldrich. Mr. Aldrich has  taken the examinations this year for the first time, although several of  his unsuccessful rivals for the honor have entered before in years past.  He has been for some time in the office of Mr. C. H. Blackall, and has  been engaged upon important work, such as the new Tremont Temple, which  is now approaching completion.    In 1884 he entered the Department of Architecture at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, and completed the two years' special course in  1887, and then went to the office of Mr. John Calvin Stevens in  Portland, Me. He afterwards worked in the Boston office of McKim, Mead &  White, and in the office of Peabody & Stearns, where he was engaged upon  the drawings for the buildings at the World's Fair. As will be seen, he  has had a varied experience and is well equipped to make the best use of  his opportunities for the next two years.    It has been the custom in recent years with the winners of the  scholarship to delay their departure until midsummer or early fall, but  Mr. Aldrich proposes to start in June. His plan of work has not yet been  entirely fixed, but he will probably spend a large part of his time in  Italy, working in conjunction with the American atelier at Rome.           *       *       *       *       *    The three other scholarships in which the same problem in design was  employed have also been awarded. For the McKim Fellowship of Columbia  College ten designs were submitted. The award was made to Mr. John  Russell Pope of New York, a graduate from the school in the class of  1894. The Roman Scholarship was also awarded to Mr. Pope. In the  competition for the latter twenty-three designs were entered, and  besides the first award honorable mention was given to Mr. Henry E.  Emery of Nyack, N. Y., Mr. Fellows of Chicago, and Mr. Bossange and Mr.  Ayres of New York, graduates of Columbia College, and to Mr. Percy Ash  of Philadelphia.    In the University of Pennsylvania Scholarship in Architecture there were  six competitors, and the award was made to Mr. Percy Ash, a graduate of  the University. Mr. Ash has also had several years' practical experience  in the best offices of Philadelphia, such as those of Cope & Stewardson  and Frank Miles Day & Bro.    Mr. H. L. Duhring, Jr., of the Senior class in the University, was given  second place.           *       *       *       *       *    The _American Architect_, in an interesting notice of the recent  exhibition of the Boston Society of Architects and Boston Architectural  Club, takes the occasion to comment unfavorably upon the disfigurement  of the catalogue by advertisements, which it says are \"most excellent  things in their proper place, but wholly out of place in an exhibition  catalogue.\" Why this is so it is hard to see, unless the _Architect_  believes that there is not advertising enough to go round, and that it  should all be reserved for the trade and professional papers. At all  events this is \"kicking against the pricks,\" for it is well known that  the expenses of such exhibitions cannot be met without some outside  assistance, and the most feasible plan that has been found for making  both ends meet is to interest the dealers in materials used in the  buildings represented in the exhibitions. As these dealers are seldom  named on the drawings exhibited, it seems proper that some return should  be made for their most valuable assistance, without which the exhibition  would not be possible.    The _Architect_ further says: \"The position taken by the St. Louis  Chapter A. I. A. was the proper and dignified one, and it ought to be  followed elsewhere. The catalogue of their recent exhibition, although a  much more costly one than either the Boston or the League catalogue,  contains not a line of advertising matter.\" This is certainly an amusing  misstatement. Instead of \"not a line,\" this catalogue has more space  devoted to advertising than any of the others mentioned. What it would  have been without its sixty-four pages of advertising, yielding an  income of at least $50 a page, we leave others to figure out. Some of  these pages we should prefer to see treated differently, as they do  detract from the illustrations which they face, and they are sprinkled  full of water-closets, radiators, bath-tubs, and various other building  appliances not especially artistic in their suggestiveness. Still there  is considerable taste and care evinced in the arrangement of many of the  pages, and they are well printed on good paper. Possibly this accounts  for the failure of the _Architect_ to recognize them as advertisements.    The dignified course, it seems to us, is that followed by the committee  of the Boston exhibition. In this case a certain number of pages was  reserved in the catalogue to be devoted to advertising, and the houses  to be represented were given to understand that all would be treated  alike. No cuts would be used, and the pages would all be set in type of  uniform style, thus insuring a desirable ensemble. We think that the  advertising when well presented adds to, rather than detracts from, the  interest of a catalogue. Our only desire is to see it done in good  taste. The display of plumbing apparatus and all manner of building  appliances we do not consider in good taste in this place.    The secretaries of a number of the architectural clubs have very kindly  responded to our request for notices and reports of their meetings and  proceedings, and we are pleased to be able to give short reports of such  occurrences as are of general interest. There are some clubs, however,  from whom we have not yet heard, and we would suggest that it will be a  help to all concerned if the secretaries of all the architectural clubs  will furnish us with short accounts of their regular meetings and of any  other occasions of importance. We shall be pleased also to publish any  correspondence which will in any way further the interests of these  organizations. We shall be glad to have THE BROCHURE SERIES considered  as the organ of communication between the various clubs, and will place  our services at their command.

How much the revival of the classic influence of the early colonial and  the immediately succeeding period is going to prevail in the  establishment of a distinctive American style of architecture it is now  difficult or indeed impossible to determine; but at all events the  reaction from the Queen Anne vagaries of ten years ago to the more  severe mass and chaste detail of the recent so-called colonial houses is  a step in the right direction, and we have much to be thankful for in  the improvement which this tendency has wrought in our recent domestic  architecture. Beautiful and admirable as some of the recent examples of  this work are, very few show the subtle appreciation of design to be  found in many of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19270"],[0,"Directives from the Guardian (#2)"],[1,"E: WORLD OBJECTIVES)      \"As to the three aims which Shoghi Effendi has stated in his America and  the Most Great Peace to have been the chief objectives of 'Abdu'l-Baha's  ministry, it should be pointed out that the first was: The establishment  of the Cause in America; the erection of the Baha'i Temple in I_sh_qabad,  and the building on Mt. Carmel of a mausoleum marking the resting-place of  the Bab, were the two remaining ones.\"            3: ADMINISTRATION--ATTITUDE TOWARDS (NATIONAL ASSEMBLY'S STATEMENT  APPROVED)      \"He also wishes me to express his approval of your statement in the  November issue of the Baha'i News to the effect of creating within the  Assemblies and individual believers a more positive and active attitude  towards the Administration. The need for positive action seems, indeed, to  be one of the most urgent needs of the Cause at present.\"            4: ADMINISTRATION, BAHA'I--(RULES AND REGULATIONS)      \"The various rulings and regulations recorded in the 'Baha'i  Administration', and the supplementary statements already issued by the  National Assembly, he feels, are for the present sufficiently detailed to  guide the friends in their present-day activities... The American  believers, as well as their National representatives, must henceforth  direct their attention to the greater and vital issues which an already  established Administration is called upon to face and handle, rather than  allow their energies to be expended in the consideration of purely  secondary administrative matters.\"            5: ADMINISTRATION (STUDY AND APPLY)      \"Without the study and application of the administration the teaching of  the Cause becomes not only meaningless, but loses in effectiveness and  scope.\"            6: ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY (RELATED TO AMERICA)      \"Now that they (the American believers) have erected the administrative  machinery of the Cause they must put it to its real use--serving only as  an instrument to facilitate the flow of the spirit of the Faith out into  the world. Just as the muscles enable the body to carry out the will of  the individual, all Assemblies and committees must enable the believers to  carry forth the Message of God to the waiting public, the love of  Baha'u'llah, and the healing laws and principles of the Faith to all men.\"            7: AFRICAN STUDENTS AND VISITORS      \"He hopes that wherever it is possible the believers will make every  effort to contact African students and visitors, and to show them kindness  and hospitality. This may not only lead to the conversion of some while in  America, but will also make friends for the Faith in Africa.\"            8: AGES AND EPOCHS (DEFINE)      \"The Faith is divided into three Ages: the Heroic, the Formative, the  Golden Age, as has been outlined in His Writings. The Heroic Age closed  with the Ascension of 'Abdu'l-Baha. The Formative Age is divided into  epochs. The first epoch lasted 25 years. We are now actually in the second  epoch of the Formative Age. How long the Formative Age will last is not  known, and there will probably be a number of epochs in it.    \"The Divine Plan of 'Abdu'l-Baha is divided into epochs. The first  Seven-Year Plan constituted the first stage of the first epoch; the second  Seven-Year Plan constitutes the second stage; while the Ten-Year Crusade  will constitute the third stage of the first epoch of the Divine Plan. The  first epoch of the Divine Plan will conclude with the conclusion of the  Ten-Year Crusade.\"            9: ALLAH-U-ABHA (BAHA'I GREETING)      \"The Baha'is are free to greet each other with Allah-u-Abha when they  meet, if they want to, but they should avoid anything which to outsiders,  in a western country, might seem like some strange Oriental password. We  must be very firm on principles and laws, but very normal and natural in  our ways, so as to attract strangers.\"            10: ANNUAL CONVENTION      \"I am deeply convinced that if the Annual Convention of the friends in  America, as well as the National Spiritual Assembly, desire to become  potent instruments for the speedy realization of the Beloved's fondest  hopes for the future of that country, they should endeavor, first and  foremost, to exemplify, in an increasing degree, to all Baha'is and to the  world at large the high ideals of fellowship and service which Baha'u'llah  and the beloved Master repeatedly set before them.\"            11: AQDAS (THE)--LAWS OF      \"In view of the importance of such a statement, he feels it is his duty to  explain that the Laws revealed by Baha'u'llah in the Aqdas are, whenever  practical and not in direct conflict with the Civil laws of the land,  absolutely binding on every believer or Baha'i institution whether in the  East or in the West. Certain laws, such as fasting, obligatory prayers,  the consent of the parents before marriage, avoidance of alcoholic drinks,  monogamy, should be regarded by all believers as universally and vitally  applicable at the present time. Others have been formulated in  anticipation of a state of society destined to emerge from the chaotic  conditions that prevail today.    \"When the Aqdas is published, this matter will be further explained and  elucidated. What has not been formulated in the Aqdas, in addition to  matters of detail and of secondary importance arising out of the  application of the laws already formulated by Baha'u'llah, will have to be  enacted by the Universal House of Justice. This body can supplement but  never invalidate or modify in the least degree what has already been  formulated by Baha'u'llah. Nor has the Guardian any right whatsoever to  lessen the binding effect much less to abrogate the provisions of so  fundamental and sacred a Book...\"            12: ARCHIVES (THE IMPORTANCE OF)      \"The importance of the institution of Baha'i Archives is not due only to  the many teaching facilities it procures, but is especially to be found in  the vast amount of historical data and information it offers both to the  present-day administrators of the Cause, and to the Baha'i historians of  the future. The institution of Baha'i Archives is indeed a most valuable  storehouse of information regarding all the aspects of the Faith,  administrative as well as doctrinal. Future generations of believers will  be surely in a better position than we are to truly and adequately  appreciate the many advantages and facilities which the institution of the  Archives offers to individual believers and also to the community at  large. Now that the Cause is rapidly passing through so many different  phases of its evolution, is the time for the friends to exert their utmost  in order to preserve as much as they can of the sacred relics and various  other precious objects that are associated with the lives of the Founders  of the Faith, and particularly the Tablets They have revealed. Every  believer should realize that he has a definite responsibility to shoulder  in this matter, and to help, to whatever extent he can, in rendering  successful and valuable work which National and local Baha'i Archives  committees are so devotedly accomplishing for the Faith in America.\"            13: ARCHIVES      \"The general principle should be that any object used by Him in person  should be preserved for posterity, whether in the local or National  Archives. It is the duty and responsibility of the Baha'i Assemblies to  ascertain carefully whether such objects are genuine or not, and to  exercise the utmost caution in the matter.\"            14: ASSEMBLIES--UNITY OF (BAHA'U'LLAH'S PROMISE)      \"Baha'u'llah has given the promise that in every Assembly where unity and  harmony prevail, there His glorious spirit will not only be present, but  will animate, sustain and guide all the friends in all their  deliberations.    \"It is to unity that the Guardian has been continually calling the  friends: For where a united will exists, nothing can effectively oppose  and hamper the forces of constructive development.\"            15: ASSEMBLY MEETINGS      \"The Spiritual Assembly must decide how often it should meet in order to  properly handle the affairs of the Cause under its jurisdiction. Twice a  week or twice a month is not the point, the point is that it should be  alert and carry on the work adequately.\"            16: ASSEMBLY VACANCY      \"...It is establishing a dangerous precedent to allow Assemblies to put a  time limit on non-attendance of their members at meetings of the S.A.,  beyond which that person is automatically dropped from the Assembly and a  vacancy declared ... there should be no time limit fixed by Assemblies  beyond which a person is dropped. Every case of prolonged absence from the  sessions of the Assembly should be considered separately by that Assembly,  and if the person is seen to not want to attend meetings or to be held  away from them indefinitely because of illness or travel, then a vacancy  could legitimately be declared and a new member be elected.\"            17: ASSOCIATE COMMITTEE MEMBERS (APPOINTING OF)      \"The Guardian wishes your Assembly to abandon the practice of appointing  associate members to some of the committees... Such a practice, he feels,  tends to create confusion and misunderstanding.\"            18: ATTACKS FROM CHURCH MISSIONARIES      \"The Guardian has read very carefully the letters your Assembly has  received from the Spiritual Assemblies of Urbana and Chicago, reporting  the criticisms that have been advanced by Rev. John Elder, a missionary  from Iran. While he is certain that such attacks from church missionaries  are destined to increase in number and force in the future, he feels that  for the present they do not constitute a challenge so grave and widespread  as to justify any strong action by your Assembly.
