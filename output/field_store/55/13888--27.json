The rest of his time he spent either on the seashore, or in the boats  of the fishermen; and he could swim, row, or handle a boat under sail  in all weather, as well or better than any lad in the village of his  own age.    His disposition was a happy one, and he was a general favourite among  the boatmen. He had not, as yet, made up his mind as to his future. His  mother wanted him to follow his father's profession. He himself longed  to go to sea, but he had promised his mother that he would never do so  without her consent, and that consent he had no hope of obtaining.    The better-class people in the village shook their heads gravely over  James Walsham, and prophesied no good things of him. They considered  that he demeaned himself greatly by association with the fisher boys,  and more than once he had fallen into disgrace, with the more quiet  minded of the inhabitants, by mischievous pranks. His reputation that  way once established, every bit of mischief in the place, which could  not be clearly traced to someone else, was put down to him; and as he  was not one who would peach upon others to save himself, he was seldom  in a position to prove his innocence.    The parson had once called upon Mrs. Walsham, and had talked to her  gravely over her son's delinquencies, but his success had not been  equal to his anticipations. Mrs. Walsham had stood up warmly for her  son.    \"The boy may get into mischief sometimes, Mr. Allanby, but it is the  nature of boys to do so. James is a good boy, upright and honourable,  and would not tell a lie under any consideration. What is he to do? If  I could afford to send him to a good school it would be a different  thing, but that you know I cannot do. From nine in the morning, until  five in the afternoon, my time is occupied by teaching, and I cannot  expect, nor do I wish, that he should sit moping indoors all day. He  had far better be out in the boats with the fishermen, than be hanging  about the place doing nothing. If anything happened to me, before he is  started in life, there would be nothing for him but to take to the sea.  I am laying by a little money every month, and if I live for another  year there will be enough to buy him a fishing boat and nets. I trust  that it may not come to that, but I see nothing derogatory in his  earning an honest living with his own hands. He will always be  something better than a common fisherman. The education I have striven  to give him, and his knowledge that he was born a gentleman, will nerve  him to try and rise.    \"As to what you say about mischief, so far as I know all boys are  mischievous. I know that my own brothers were always getting into  scrapes, and I have no doubt, Mr. Allanby, that when you look back upon  your own boyhood, you will see that you were not an exception to the  general rule.\"    Mr. Allanby smiled. He had come rather against his own inclinations;  but his wife had urged him to speak to Mrs. Walsham, her temper being  ruffled by the disappearance of two favourite pigeons, whose loss she,  without a shadow of evidence, most unjustly put down to James Walsham.    The parson was by no means strict with his flock. He was a tall man,  inclined to be portly, a good shot and an ardent fisherman; and  although he did not hunt, he was frequently seen on his brown cob at  the meet, whenever it took place within a reasonable distance of  Sidmouth; and without exactly following the hounds, his knowledge of  the country often enabled him to see more of the hunt than those who  did.    As Mrs. Walsham spoke, the memory of his old school and college days  came across him.    \"That is the argumentum ad hominem, Mrs. Walsham, and when a lady takes  to that we can say no more. You know I like your boy. There is much  that is good in him; but it struck me that you were letting him run a  little too wild. However, there is much in what you say, and I don't  believe that he is concerned in half the mischief that he gets credit  for. Still, you must remember that a little of the curb, just a little,  is good for us all. It spoils a horse to be always tugging at his  mouth, but he will go very badly if he does not feel that there is a  hand on the reins.    \"I have said the same thing to the squire. He spoils that boy of his,  for whom, between ourselves, I have no great liking. The old man will  have trouble with him before he is done, or I am greatly mistaken.\"    Nothing came of Mr. Allanby's visit. Mrs. Walsham told James that he  had been there to remonstrate with her.    \"I do not want to stop you from going out sailing, Jim; but I wish you  would give up your mischievous pranks, they only get you bad will and a  bad name in the place. Many people here think that I am wrong in  allowing you to associate so much with the fisher boys, and when you  get into scrapes, it enables them to impress upon me how right they  were in their forecasts. I do not want my boy to be named in the same  breath with those boys of Robson's, or young Peterson, or Blame.\"    \"But you know I have nothing to do with them, mother,\" James said  indignantly. \"They spend half their time about the public house, and  they do say that when Peterson has been out with that lurcher of his,  he has been seen coming back with his coat bulged out, and there is  often a smell of hare round his father's cottage at supper time. You  know I wouldn't have anything to do with them.\"    \"No, Jim, I am sure you would not; but if people mix up your name with  theirs it is almost as bad for you as if you had. Unfortunately, people  are too apt not to distinguish between tricks which are really only the  outcome of high spirit, and a lack of something better to do, and real  vice. Therefore, Jim, I say, keep yourself from mischief. I know that,  though you are out of doors so many hours of the day, you really do get  through a good deal of work; but other people do not give you credit  for this. Remember how your father was respected here. Try to act  always as you would have done had he been alive, and you cannot go far  wrong.\"    James had done his best, but he found it hard to get rid of his  reputation for getting into mischief, and more than once, when falsely  suspected, he grumbled that he might just as well have the fun of the  thing, for he was sure to have the blame.    As Jim Walsham and his companions were chatting in the shade of a boat,  their conversation was abruptly broken off by the sight of a figure  coming along the road. It was a tall figure, with a stiff military  bearing. He was pushing before him a large box, mounted on a framework  supported by four wheels. Low down, close to the ground, swung a large  flat basket. In this, on a shawl spread over a thick bed of hay, sat a  little girl some five years old.    \"It is the sergeant,\" one of the boys exclaimed. \"I wonder whether he  has got a fresh set of views? The last were first-rate ones.\"    The sergeant gave a friendly nod to the boys as he passed, and then,  turning up the main street from the beach, went along until he came to  a shaded corner, and there stopped. The boys had all got up and  followed him, and now stood looking on with interest at his  proceedings. The little girl had climbed out of her basket as soon as  he stopped, and after asking leave, trotted back along the street to  the beach, and was soon at play among the seaweed and stones.    She was a singularly pretty child, with dark blue eyes, and brown hair  with a touch of gold. Her print dress was spotlessly clean and neat; a  huge flapping sunbonnet shaded her face, whose expression was bright  and winning.    \"Well, boys,\" the sergeant said cheerfully, \"how have you been getting  on since I was here last? Nobody drowned, I hope, or come to any ill.  Not that we must grumble, whatever comes. We have all got to do our  duty, whether it be to march up a hill with shot and shell screaming  and whistling round, as I have had to do; or to be far out at sea with  the wind blowing fit to take the hair off your head, as comes to your  lot sometimes; or following the plough from year's end to year's end,  as happens to some. We have got to make the best of it, whatever it is.    \"I have got a grand new set of pictures from Exeter. They came all the  way down from London town for me by waggon. London Bridge, and Windsor  Castle, with the flag flying over it, telling that the king--God bless  his gracious majesty--is at home.    \"Then, I have got some pictures of foreign parts that will make you  open your eyes. There's Niagara. I don't know whether you've heard of  it, but it's a place where a great river jumps down over a wall of  rock, as high as that steeple there, with a roar like thunder that can  be heard, they say, on a still night, for twenty miles round.    \"I have got some that will interest you more still, because you are  sailors, or are going to be sailors. I have got one of the killing of a  whale. He has just thrown a boat, with five sailors, into the air, with  a lash of his tail; but it's of no use, for there are other boats  round, and the harpoons are striking deep in his flesh. He is a big  fish, and a strong one; but he will be beaten, for he does not know how  to use his strength. That's the case with many men. They throw away  their life and their talents, just because they don't know what's in  them, and what they might do if they tried.    \"And I have got a picture of the fight with the Spanish Armada. You  have heard about that, boys, surely; for it began out there, over the  water, almost in sight of Sidmouth, and went on all the way up the  Channel; our little ships hanging on to the great Spaniards and giving  them no rest, but worrying them, and battering them, till they were  glad to sail away to the Dutch coast. But they were not safe there, for  we sent fire ships at them, and they had to cut and run; and then a  storm came on,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17770"],[0,"Christmas Stories And Legends (#2)"],[1,"ren's giving a  part of your Christmas celebration, have you not?\"    \"Certainly!\" rejoined Marcia. \"They have always brought their little  gifts for the poor, and that is all right; but this time there are no  gifts to the Sunday school at all.\"    \"Not even to the Primary School?\" asked Augusta.    \"Well,\" admitted Marcia, \"Mr. Robinson gave the children their choice  today, whether they would have the old Christmas or the 'White Gift  Christmas,' and they all voted for the new idea.\"    \"Why then should the children be obliged to have gifts, if they don't  want them?\" laughed Augusta.    \"Oh, children are always taken with novelty, and Mr. Robinson told it  to them in such a way that fancy was captivated; but I don't think  they really understood what they were giving up.\"    \"Marcia, it seems to me that your are emphasizing the wrong side of  the subject if I understand it aright,\" said Jack.    \"Why, do you know about it?\" asked Marcia, in surprise.    \"Not much,\" replied Jack; \"but I read the White Gift story in the  'Sunday School Times,' and the report of the Painesville experiment.\"    \"Well, Jack, tell us what you know about this mysterious 'White  Gift',\" commanded his father.    \"I would rather Marcia should tell it, father; I know so little.\"    \"Oh, go on, Jack,\" urged Marcia; \"you can't possibly know less about  it than I do, for I confess I was so full of the disappointment of the  little ones that the other side of it didn't impress me very much.\"    \"Well, as I remember it,\" said Jack, \"the gist of the plan is  this--that Christmas is Christ's birthday, and we should make our  gifts to him, instead of to one another; and the idea of the White  Gift was suggested by the story of the Persian king named Kublah Khan,  who was a wise and good ruler, and greatly beloved. On his birthday  his subjects kept what they called the 'White Feast.' This was  celebrated in an immense great white banqueting-hall, and each one of  his subjects brought to their king a white gift to express that the  love and loyalty of their hearts was without stain. The rich brought  white chargers, ivory and alabaster; the poor brought white pigeons,  or even a measure of rice; and the great king regarded all gifts  alike, so long as they were white. Have I told it right, cousin?\"  queried Jack.    \"Yes, I think so. It is a beautiful thought, I must confess, and might  be all right in a large, rich Sunday school; but in a mission school  like ours I am sure it will be a failure. It will end in our losing  our scholars. I don't believe in taking up new ideas without  considering whether they are adapted to our needs or not. But please,  dear folkses, don't let us say anything more about it,\" pleaded  Marcia, and so the subject was dropped.    That evening as Jack Thornton bade his cousin good-bye, he placed in  her hand a little package, saying: \"I am so sorry, Marcia, that I  can't be here for your birthday, but here is my remembrance. Now don't  you dare open it before Tuesday, and, dear, you may be sure it is a  'white gift,' and may you have a 'white birthday'.\" And before she  could say a word, he had opened the door, and was gone.    Touched by his thoughtful gift and his words, she said to herself: \"A  'white birthday!' I always have perfectly beautiful birthdays.\" And so  she did; for she was always looking out for other people's birthdays,  and making much of them; and so she always got the gospel measure:  \"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and  shaken together, and running over, shall man give into your bosom.\"    But these thoughts were crowded out by the pressure of things to be  done--father and mother had gone into the country to visit a sick  friend, and the younger brothers and sisters surrounded her and  clamored for songs and Bible stories, and as she was a good older  sister she devoted herself to them until their bedtime. Then, turning  out the lights, she sat down in an easy chair before the library  grate, and yielded herself to the spell of the quiet hour. The  strained, irritated nerves relaxed, and a strange, sweet peace stole  over her. As she gazed dreamily into the fire, a star seemed to rise  out of the glowing coals, and beam at her with a beautiful soft  radiance, and the words of the Evangel came into her mind: \"And when  they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding joy; and when they  were come into the house they saw the young child, with Mary his  mother, and they fell down and worshipped him; and when they had  opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts, gold,  frankincense and myrrh.\" She repeated the words over and over to  herself. How simple and restful they were; how direct and genuine and  satisfying was this old-time giving! There it was--Gifts for the  Christ-Child--\"They presented unto him gifts, gold, frankincense and  myrrh.\" She remembered reading somewhere that the gold represented our  earthly possessions, the frankincense typified our service and the  myrrh our suffering for his sake.    As she gazed into the fire, and mused, she fell asleep, and all these  thoughts were woven into the fabric of a dream--and who shall say that  God does not speak to his children still in dreams?    She dreamed that it was the morning of her birthday. She heard cheery  voices in the hall calling out to one another: \"This is Marcia's  birthday. Wish you many returns of the day!\" There was an excited  running to and fro between the different rooms, and gleeful  exclamations--but no one came near her! She sat up in bed listening,  and wondering what it could mean! Why, mother always came into her  room, and folded her to her heart, and said those precious things that  only a mother can say; and the children always scrambled to see who  should be the first to give sister a birthday kiss. Were they playing  some joke on her? She would be quiet and watch, and so not be taken  unawares.    Presently they went trooping happily downstairs into the dining-room,  and she heard father's voice say: \"Good morning, children; I wish you  many happy returns of Marcia's birthday.\"    What did it all mean? Was she going crazy? Or were they just going to  surprise her by some novel way of celebrating her birthday? She arose,  and with trembling fingers dressed herself hastily, and stole softly  down the stairs, and looked into the dining-room. Hush!--father was  asking a blessing. He returned thanks for dear Marcia's birthday, and  asked that it should be a happy day for them all. Beside each plate  save her own, were various packages; and these were opened amid  ejaculations of surprise and pleasure, and sundry hugs and kisses.    After the first burst of happiness had subsided, Marcia braced herself  and entered the dining-room, saying with forced gayety: \"Good morning,  dear ones all.\" They looked up with blank, unanswering faces, and  said: \"Good morning, Marcia\"--that was all. But Marcia's heart leaped  at the recognition of her presence, for she had begun to fear that she  was dead, and that it was her spirit that was wandering about.    She stooped and kissed her mother, who murmured abstractedly, \"Yes,  dear,\" never once looking up from the presents she was examining. With  a sinking heart she turned away from her mother and went and stood  behind her father's chair, and leaning over whispered in his ear:  \"Dear father, have you forgotten that this is my birthday?\" He  answered kindly but absent-mindedly: \"Why, daughter, am I likely to  forget it with all these tokens around me?\"--and he waved his hand  toward the gifts piled around his plate. This was almost more than  Marcia could bear, for father was always specially tender and  attentive to her on her birthday. She always sat on his knee a while;  and he told her what a joy and comfort she was to him, and he always  paid her some pretty compliment that made her girlish heart swell with  innocent pride, for every girl knows that compliments from one's  father are a little sweeter than any others.    In vain she hung around waiting for some clue to this mysterious,  unnatural conduct of the family. They were all absorbed in plans for  spending this birthday--Marcia's birthday, but no reference whatever  was made to what she liked; no one consulted her as to what she wanted  to do, or to have done. The boys were going skating in the forenoon;  the little girls were to invite four of their friends to help serve  the first dinner in the new doll's house, and in the afternoon father  would take them all for an automobile ride into the country to a dear  friend's--all but Marcia, who couldn't bear to get into an auto since  a terrible accident she had been in a few weeks ago. A troop of her  girl friends came in, and in a conventional way wished her \"many happy  returns\" of the day; and then proceeded to ignore her, and gave gifts  to other members of the family. \"It is a wonder,\" thought Marcia,  bitterly, \"that they didn't have a birthday party for Marcia with  Marcia left out.\"    And so it went on all through that strange, miserable day; while they  were all busy celebrating her birthday, she herself was neglected and  ignored as she sat in the quiet house alone in the twilight--for she  had no heart to light the gas--just homesick for the personal love  which had characterized all her birthdays and all her home life  heretofore, there came a timid knock on the door, and as Marcia opened  it, there stood little crippled Joe, one of her scholars in the  Mission Sunday school. As he saw her, he gave a little exclamation of  surprise and delight, and said: \"O Miss Marshay! I hearn last night  'twas yer berthday today, an' I wanted to guv yer suthin' white, like  Mr. Robinson he told us 'bout, don't yer know?--an' 'caus yer has  allers treated me so white--'n'--'n' I didn't hev nuthin', 'n so I  axed Him, ye know, what yer telled us 'bout in Sunday school--Jesus;  who died on the cross, and who's allers willin' "]]]
