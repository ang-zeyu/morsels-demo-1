Her mind was busy at once,  going over all the things which he had said to her and she had said to  him--quiet-like. \"Directly I saw him I said to myself--\" Why, you could  have knocked her over with a feather. Feathers, indeed, were a perpetual  menace to Audrey.    However, the immediate business was to find the master. She walked  across the hall to the library, glanced in, came back a little  uncertainly, and stood in front of Cayley.    \"If you please, sir,\" she said in a low, respectful voice, \"can you tell  me where the master is? It's Mr. Robert called.\"    \"What?\" said Cayley, looking up from his book. \"Who?\"    Audrey repeated her question.    \"I don't know. Isn't he in the office? He went up to the Temple after  lunch. I don't think I've seen him since.\"    \"Thank you, sir. I will go up to the Temple.\"    Cayley returned to his book.    The \"Temple\" was a brick summer-house, in the gardens at the back of  the house, about three hundred yards away. Here Mark meditated sometimes  before retiring to the \"office\" to put his thoughts upon paper. The  thoughts were not of any great value; moreover, they were given off at  the dinner-table more often than they got on to paper, and got on to  paper more often than they got into print. But that did not prevent  the master of The Red House from being a little pained when a visitor  treated the Temple carelessly, as if it had been erected for the  ordinary purposes of flirtation and cigarette-smoking. There had been an  occasion when two of his guests had been found playing fives in it. Mark  had said nothing at the time, save to ask with a little less than his  usual point--whether they couldn't find anywhere else for their game,  but the offenders were never asked to The Red House again.    Audrey walked slowly up to the Temple, looked in and walked slowly back.  All that walk for nothing. Perhaps the master was upstairs in his room.  \"Not well-dressed enough for the drawing-room.\" Well, now, Auntie, would  you like anyone in your drawing-room with a red handkerchief round his  neck and great big dusty boots, and--listen! One of the men shooting  rabbits. Auntie was partial to a nice rabbit, and onion sauce. How hot  it was; she wouldn't say no to a cup of tea. Well, one thing, Mr. Robert  wasn't staying the night; he hadn't any luggage. Of course Mr. Mark  could lend him things; he had clothes enough for six. She would have  known him anywhere for Mr. Mark's brother.    She came into the house. As she passed the housekeeper's room on her  way to the hall, the door opened suddenly, and a rather frightened face  looked out.    \"Hallo, Aud,\" said Elsie. \"It's Audrey,\" she said, turning into the  room.    \"Come in, Audrey,\" called Mrs. Stevens.    \"What's up?\" said Audrey, looking in at the door.    \"Oh, my dear, you gave me such a turn. Where have you been?\"    \"Up to the Temple.\"    \"Did you hear anything?\"    \"Hear what?\"    \"Bangs and explosions and terrible things.\"    \"Oh!\" said Audrey, rather relieved. \"One of the men shooting rabbits.  Why, I said to myself as I came along, 'Auntie's partial to a nice  rabbit,' I said, and I shouldn't be surprised if--\"    \"Rabbits!\" said her aunt scornfully. \"It was inside the house, my girl.\"    \"Straight it was,\" said Elsie. She was one of the housemaids. \"I said to  Mrs. Stevens--didn't I, Mrs. Stevens?--'That was in the house,' I said.\"    Audrey looked at her aunt and then at Elsie.    \"Do you think he had a revolver with him?\" she said in a hushed voice.    \"Who?\" said Elsie excitedly.    \"That brother of his. From Australia. I said as soon as I set eyes on  him, 'You're a bad lot, my man!' That's what I said, Elsie. Even before  he spoke to me. Rude!\" She turned to her aunt. \"Well, I give you my  word.\"    \"If you remember, Audrey, I always said there was no saying with anyone  from Australia.\" Mrs. Stevens lay back in her chair, breathing rather  rapidly. \"I wouldn't go out of this room now, not if you paid me a  hundred thousand pounds.\"    \"Oh, Mrs. Stevens!\" said Elsie, who badly wanted five shillings for a  new pair of shoes, \"I wouldn't go as far as that, not myself, but--\"    \"There!\" cried Mrs. Stevens, sitting up with a start. They listened  anxiously, the two girls instinctively coming closer to the older  woman's chair.    A door was being shaken, kicked, rattled.    \"Listen!\"    Audrey and Elsie looked at each other with frightened eyes.    They heard a man's voice, loud, angry.    \"Open the door!\" it was shouting. \"Open the door! I say, open the door!\"    \"Don't open the door!\" cried Mrs. Stevens in a panic, as if it was her  door which was threatened. \"Audrey! Elsie! Don't let him in!\"    \"Damn it, open the door!\" came the voice again.    \"We're all going to be murdered in our beds,\" she quavered. Terrified,  the two girls huddled closer, and with an arm round each, Mrs. Stevens  sat there, waiting.          CHAPTER II. Mr. Gillingham Gets Out at the Wrong Station      Whether Mark Ablett was a bore or not depended on the point of view, but  it may be said at once that he never bored his company on the subject of  his early life. However, stories get about. There is always somebody  who knows. It was understood--and this, anyhow, on Mark's own  authority--that his father had been a country clergyman. It was said  that, as a boy, Mark had attracted the notice, and patronage, of some  rich old spinster of the neighbourhood, who had paid for his education,  both at school and university. At about the time when he was coming down  from Cambridge, his father had died; leaving behind him a few debts,  as a warning to his family, and a reputation for short sermons, as an  example to his successor. Neither warning nor example seems to have been  effective. Mark went to London, with an allowance from his patron, and  (it is generally agreed) made acquaintance with the money-lenders.  He was supposed, by his patron and any others who inquired, to be  \"writing\"; but what he wrote, other than letters asking for more time  to pay, has never been discovered. However, he attended the theatres  and music halls very regularly--no doubt with a view to some serious  articles in the \"Spectator\" on the decadence of the English stage.    Fortunately (from Mark's point of view) his patron died during his third  year in London, and left him all the money he wanted. From that moment  his life loses its legendary character, and becomes more a matter of  history. He settled accounts with the money-lenders, abandoned his  crop of wild oats to the harvesting of others, and became in his turn a  patron. He patronized the Arts. It was not only usurers who discovered  that Mark Ablett no longer wrote for money; editors were now offered  free contributions as well as free lunches; publishers were given  agreements for an occasional slender volume, in which the author paid  all expenses and waived all royalties; promising young painters and  poets dined with him; and he even took a theatrical company on tour,  playing host and \"lead\" with equal lavishness.    He was not what most people call a snob. A snob has been defined  carelessly as a man who loves a lord; and, more carefully, as a mean  lover of mean things--which would be a little unkind to the peerage if  the first definition were true. Mark had his vanities undoubtedly, but  he would sooner have met an actor-manager than an earl; he would have  spoken of his friendship with Dante--had that been possible--more glibly  than of his friendship with the Duke. Call him a snob if you like, but  not the worst kind of snob; a hanger-on, but to the skirts of Art, not  Society; a climber, but in the neighbourhood of Parnassus, not Hay Hill.    His patronage did not stop at the Arts. It also included Matthew Cayley,  a small cousin of thirteen, whose circumstances were as limited as had  been Mark's own before his patron had rescued him. He sent the Cayley  cousin to school and Cambridge. His motives, no doubt, were unworldly  enough at first; a mere repaying to his account in the Recording Angel's  book of the generosity which had been lavished on himself; a laying-up  of treasure in heaven. But it is probable that, as the boy grew up,  Mark's designs for his future were based on his own interests as much  as those of his cousin, and that a suitably educated Matthew Cayley of  twenty-three was felt by him to be a useful property for a man in his  position; a man, that is to say, whose vanities left him so little time  for his affairs.    Cayley, then, at twenty-three, looked after his cousin's affairs. By  this time Mark had bought the Red House and the considerable amount of  land which went with it. Cayley superintended the necessary staff.  His duties, indeed, were many. He was not quite secretary, not quite  land-agent, not quite business-adviser, not quite companion, but  something of all four. Mark leant upon him and called him \"Cay,\"  objecting quite rightly in the circumstances to the name of Matthew.  Cay, he felt was, above all, dependable; a big, heavy-jawed, solid  fellow, who didn't bother you with unnecessary talk--a boon to a man who  liked to do most of the talking himself.    Cayley was now twenty-eight, but had all the appearance of forty, which  was his patron's age. Spasmodically they entertained a good deal at the  Red House, and Mark's preference--call it kindliness or vanity, as  you please--was for guests who were not in a position to repay his  hospitality. Let us have a look at them as they came down to that  breakfast, of which Stevens, the parlour-maid, has already given us a  glimpse.    The first to appear was Major Rumbold, a tall, grey-haired,  grey-moustached, silent man, wearing a Norfolk coat and grey flannel  trousers, who lived on his retired pay and wrote natural history  articles for the papers. He inspected the dishes on the side-table,  decided carefully on kedgeree, and got to work on it. He had passed on  to a sausage by the time of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],[0,"The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#2)"],[1," and watched the long lines of Red Coats go down  before us. Just a lot of raw recruits with old flintlocks! The men who  charged us, the picked veterans of England's grand army. But we cut 'em  to pieces, Boy! I fired a cannon loaded with grape shot that mowed a  lane straight through 'em. It must have killed two hundred men. They  burned our Capitol at Washington and the Federalist traitors at Hartford  were firin' on us in the rear, but Old Hickory showed the world that we  could lick England with one hand tied behind our back. And we did it. We  drove 'em like sheep--drove 'em into the sea.    \"There's but one name on every lip in this country now, Boy, and that's  Old Hickory. He'd be President next time--but for one thing,--just one  thing--he didn't have a chance to learn when he was a boy. He's not  educated.\"    The brother paused, and a dreamy look came into his eyes. \"We may make  him President anyhow. But if he'd been educated--there wouldn't be any  if or and about it. Washington and Jefferson and Madison belong to the  rich and powerful class. Jackson is a yeoman like your father. But he'd  be President. Boy, if he'd been educated! Nothing could stop him. Don't  you see this is your country? This is a poor man's world. All you have  to do is to train your mind. You've got to do this--you  understand--you've got to do it--\"    The man paused suddenly and looked into the Boy's wondering eyes. He had  forgotten the child's rebellion. The young pioneer of the wilderness was  talking to himself. Again he had seen a vision.    He seized the Boy's arms:    \"Don't you see, Boy, don't you?\"    The child's mouth hardened again:    \"No, I don't. I'm just a little boy. I love my Mamma. She's good and  sweet to me and I'm not going to leave her--\"    Again Polly laughed.    A smile slowly played about the brother's lips and eyes. He must show  his trump card.    \"But you don't know what I've got for you--\"    \"What?\"    \"Something you've always wanted to have for your own--\"    \"A pony?\"    The man slowly rose:    \"Come out to the big road--\"    The Boy seized his sister's hand:    \"Polly, let's see!\"    The girl's eyes grew dim:    \"Oh, Jeff, I know you're goin'!\"    \"No--we'll just see what it is--come on!\"    In five minutes they emerged from the deep woods into the clearing  around a cabin. Beside the roadway stood a horse and pony, both bridled  and saddled.    The swift feet of the Boy flew across the opening, the sister wide-eyed  and trembling, close on his heels. He threw his arms around the pony's  neck and stroked his head with gentle touch. The pony pressed his mouth  against the Boy's cheek in friendly response.    \"Did you see him kiss me, Polly?\" he cried tremblingly.    \"Yes, I saw him,\" was the solemn response.    \"Isn't he a beauty? Look, Polly--he's got a white spot on every foot and  one in his forehead and black as a coal all over--and Oh--what a  saddle--a red belt and red martingales!\"    He touched the saddle lovingly and circled the pony's neck with his  arms.    The brother smiled again:    \"Well, what do you think of that?\"    The Boy was trembling now from head to foot, his heart in his throat as  he slowly asked:    \"You mean that--you'll--give--him--to me--for--all my own?\"    \"If you'll be a good boy, go to school and work hard--yes.\"    \"All right, Big Brother,\" was the quick answer, \"I'll go. Help me on him  quick, and let me try him!\"    The Boy lifted his bare foot into the strong hand, sprang into the  saddle, bounded down the road, wheeled, flew back and leaped to the  ground.    \"He's a dandy!\"    Polly dropped her head and started home, making a brave fight to keep  back the tears. Half way across the clearing she gave up in a long  pitiful wail.    The Boy, busy with his pony, had not missed her. In a moment he was by  her side, his arms about her neck.    \"Don't cry, Polly honey, I'll be back before long,\" he pleaded.    The only answer was a sob:    \"Good-by, Jeff--\"    Her hands slowly slipped through his.    \"Good-by, Polly--\"    He watched her go with quivering lips, and as the little figure slowly  faded into the shadows of the woods he called in broken accents:    \"Kiss Mamma for me--and tell her I wanted to go back and say  good-by--but Joe wouldn't let me!\"    \"Yes, honey!\"    \"And you--watch out for that old drunk man we saw once in the woods,  Polly!\"    \"Yes!\"    \"Don't let him get you--\"    \"No--I won't--good--good-by!\"    \"Good-by--\"    The last good-by stuck in the Boy's throat, but he lifted his blue eyes,  saw his pony and smiled through the tears.          II    THE WILDERNESS      A journey of a thousand miles through the unbroken wilderness--the home  of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian Nations and all on his own beautiful  pony! It was no time for tears.    The Boy's soul leaped for joy.    The party was a delightful one. Major Hinds, a veteran of General  Jackson's campaign, the commander of the famous Mississippi Dragoons at  the battle of New Orleans, was the leader, accompanied by his wife, her  sister and niece, and best of all a boy his own age, the Major's little  son Howell.    Howell also was riding a pony. He was a nice enough pony, of course, as  ponies went, but couldn't compare with his own. He made up his mind to  race the first chance they got, and show those pretty white heels to  his rival. He was just dying to tell him how fast they could beat the  ground--but he'd wait and surprise the party.    A negro maid accompanied the ladies and a stalwart black man rode a  pack-mule laden with tents, blankets and a cooking outfit. They stopped  at houses when one could be reached at nightfall. If not, they camped in  the woods beneath the towering trees. There was no need of the tents  unless it rained. So dense was the foliage that only here and there a  bright star peeped through, or a moonbeam shot its silvery thread to the  ground. The Indians were all friendly. It was the boast of the Choctaws  that no man of their breed had ever shed the blood of a white man.    For days they followed the course of the majestic river rolling its  yellow flood to the sea and watched the lazy flat and keel boats drift  slowly down to New Orleans bearing the wealth of the new Western World.  The men who had manned these rude craft were slowly tramping on foot  back to their homes in the North. Their boats could not stem the tide  for the return trip. Every day they passed these weary walkers. The Boy  was sorry they couldn't ride. His pony's step was so firm and quick and  strong.    He raced with Howell the first day and beat him so far there was no fun  in it. He never challenged his rival again. He was the guest of Major  Hinds on this trip. It would be rude. But he slipped out in the dark  that night, and hugged his pony:    \"You're the finest horse that ever was!\" he whispered.    \"Of course I am!\" the pony laughed.    \"I love you--\"    \"And I love you,\" was the quick response as the warm nose touched his  cheek.    In the second week, they reached the first stand, \"Folsoms',\" on the  border of the Choctaw Nation. These stands were log cabins occupied by  squaw men--whites who had married Indian women. They must pass three  more of these stands the Major said--the \"Leflores,\" known as the first  and second French camps, and the one at the crossing of the Tennessee  River, which had the unusual distinction of being kept by a half-breed  Chickasaw Indian.    Here, weary, footsore travelers stopped to rest and refresh  themselves--and many dropped and died miles from those they loved. The  little graveyard with its rude, wooden-marked mounds the Boy saw with a  dull ache in his heart.    And then the first bitter pang of homesickness came. He wondered if his  sweet mother were well. He wondered what she said when they told her he  had gone. He knew she had cried. What if she were dead and he could  never see her again? He sat down on a log, buried his face in his hands  and tried to cry the ache out of his heart. He felt that he must turn  back or die. But it wouldn't do. He had promised his Big Brother. He  rose, brushed the tears away, fed and watered his pony and tenderly  rubbed down every inch of his beautiful black skin. He forgot the ache  in his new-found love and the strength which had come into his boy's  soul from the sense of kinship with Nature which this beautiful dumb  four-footed friend had brought him. No man could be friendless or  forsaken who possessed the love of a horse. His horse knew and loved  him. He said it in a hundred ways. His wide, deep, lustrous eyes,  shining with intelligence, had told him! So had the touch of his big  warm mouth in many a friendly pony kiss. His pony could laugh, too. He  had seen the smiles flicker about his mouth and eyes as he pretended to  bite his bare legs. How could any human being be cruel or mean to a  horse! His pony had given him new courage and conscious power. He was  the master of Nature now when they flew along the trail through the deep  woods. His horse had given him wings.    He looked up into the star-sown sky, and promised God to be kind and  gentle to all the dumb world for the love of the beautiful friend He had  given.          III    THE HERMITAGE      At the last stand on the banks of the winding Tennessee, the Major sat  up late in eager discussion about Old Hickory with an enthusiastic  Tennesseean. The ladies had retired, and the Boy listened with quiet  eagerness to the talk.    \"Waal, we're goin' ter make Andrew Jackson President anyhow, Major!\" the  Tennesseean drawled.    \"I'm afraid they'll beat us,\" the Major answered, with a shake of his  head.    \"How'll they beat us when we git ready ter make the fight?\"    \"Old Hickory says himself, he ain't fit--\"    \"I reckon we know more about that than he does,\" persisted the man from  Tennessee.    \"The aristocrats don't think so--\"    \"What t'ell they got agin him? Ain't he the biggest man in this country  to-day? Didn't"]]]
