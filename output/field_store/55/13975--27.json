Whoso reciteth, in the privacy of his  chamber,  the verses revealed by God, the scattering angels of the Almighty  shall scatter abroad the fragrance of the words uttered by his mouth,  and shall cause the heart of every righteous man to throb.  Though he may, at first, remain unaware of its effect, yet the virtue  of the grace vouchsafed unto him must needs sooner or later exercise  its influence upon his soul. Thus have the mysteries of the Revelation  of God been decreed by virtue of the Will of Him  Who is the Source of power and wisdom.    --BAHA'U'LLAH            OBLIGATORY PRAYERS          \"The daily obligatory prayers are three in number....\"      \"The daily obligatory prayers are three in number. ... The believer is  entirely free to choose any one of these three prayers, but is under the  obligation of reciting one of them, and in accordance with any specific  directions with which they may be accompanied.\"    --from a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi    \"By 'morning,' 'noon' and 'evening,' mentioned in connection with the  Obligatory Prayers, is meant respectively the intervals between sunrise  and noon, between noon and sunset, and from sunset till two hours after  sunset.\"--Synopsis and Codification of the Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 36          SHORT OBLIGATORY PRAYER                  _TO BE RECITED ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS, AT NOON_    I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to  worship Thee.    I testify, at this moment, to my powerlessness and to Thy might, to my  poverty and to Thy wealth.    There is none other God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.          MEDIUM OBLIGATORY PRAYER          _TO BE RECITED DAILY, IN THE MORNING, AT NOON, AND IN THE EVENING_    Whoso wisheth to pray, let him wash his hands, and while he washeth, let  him say:    Strengthen my hand, O my God, that it may take hold of Thy Book with such  steadfastness that the hosts of the world shall have no power over it.  Guard it, then, from meddling with whatsoever doth not belong unto it.  Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.    And while washing his face, let him say:    I have turned my face unto Thee, O my Lord! Illumine it with the light of  Thy countenance. Protect it, then, from turning to anyone but Thee.    Then let him stand up, and facing the Qiblih (Point of Adoration, i.e.  Bahji, Akka), let him say:    God testifieth that there is none other God but Him. His are the kingdoms  of Revelation and of creation. He, in truth, hath manifested Him Who is  the Dayspring of Revelation, Who conversed on Sinai, through Whom the  Supreme Horizon hath been made to shine, and the Lote-Tree beyond which  there is no passing hath spoken, and through Whom the call hath been  proclaimed unto all who are in heaven and on earth: \"Lo, the  All-Possessing is come. Earth and heaven, glory and dominion are God's,  the Lord of all men, and the Possessor of the Throne on high and of earth  below!\"    Let him, then, bend down, with hands resting on the knees, and say:    Exalted art Thou above my praise and the praise of anyone beside me, above  my description and the description of all who are in heaven and all who  are on earth!    Then, standing with open hands, palms upward toward the face, let him say:    Disappoint not, O my God, him that hath, with beseeching fingers, clung to  the hem of Thy mercy and Thy grace, O Thou Who of those who show mercy art  the Most Merciful!    Let him, then, be seated and say:    I bear witness to Thy unity and Thy oneness, and that Thou art God, and  that there is none other God beside Thee. Thou hast, verily, revealed Thy  Cause, fulfilled Thy Covenant, and opened wide the door of Thy grace to  all that dwell in heaven and on earth. Blessing and peace, salutation and  glory, rest upon Thy loved ones, whom the changes and chances of the world  have not deterred from turning unto Thee, and who have given their all, in  the hope of obtaining that which is with Thee. Thou art, in truth, the  Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.    (If anyone choose to recite instead of the long verse these words: \"God  testifieth that there is none other God but Him, the Help in Peril, the  Self-Subsisting,\" it would be sufficient. And likewise, it would suffice  were he, while seated, to choose to recite these words: \"I bear witness to  Thy unity and Thy oneness, and that Thou art God, and that there is none  other God beside Thee.\")    --Baha'u'llah          LONG OBLIGATORY PRAYER                      _TO BE RECITED ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS_    Whoso wisheth to recite this prayer, let him stand up and turn unto God,  and, as he standeth in his place, let him gaze to the right and to the  left, as if awaiting the mercy of his Lord, the Most Merciful, the  Compassionate. Then let him say:    O Thou Who art the Lord of all names and the Maker of the heavens! I  beseech Thee by them Who are the Daysprings of Thine invisible Essence,  the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious, to make of my prayer a fire that will  burn away the veils which have shut me out from Thy beauty, and a light  that will lead me unto the ocean of Thy Presence.    Let him then raise his hands in supplication toward God--blessed and  exalted be He--and say:    O Thou the Desire of the world and the Beloved of the nations! Thou seest  me turning toward Thee, and rid of all attachment to anyone save Thee, and  clinging to Thy cord, through whose movement the whole creation hath been  stirred up. I am Thy servant, O my Lord, and the son of Thy servant.  Behold me standing ready to do Thy will and Thy desire, and wishing naught  else except Thy good pleasure. I implore Thee by the Ocean of Thy mercy  and the Daystar of Thy grace to do with Thy servant as Thou willest and  pleasest. By Thy might which is far above all mention and praise!  Whatsoever is revealed by Thee is the desire of my heart and the beloved  of my soul. O God, my God! Look not upon my hopes and my doings, nay  rather look upon Thy will that hath encompassed the heavens and the earth.  By Thy Most Great Name, O Thou Lord of all nations! I have desired only  what Thou didst desire, and love only what Thou dost love.    Let him then kneel, and bowing his forehead to the ground, let him say:    Exalted art Thou above the description of anyone save Thyself, and the  comprehension of aught else except Thee.    Let him then stand and say:    Make my prayer, O my Lord, a fountain of living waters whereby I may live  as long as Thy sovereignty endureth, and may make mention of Thee in every  world of Thy worlds.    Let him again raise his hands in supplication, and say:    O Thou in separation from Whom hearts and souls have melted, and by the  fire of Whose love"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19243"],[0,"The Advent of Divine Justice (#2)"],[1," followers of the three  leading Faiths in that distracted country, have, at times, threatened to  sever all normal communications both within its confines as well as with  the outside world. Perilous though the situation has been, the Baha'i Holy  Places, the object of the adoration of a world-encircling Faith, have,  notwithstanding their number and exposed position, and though to outward  seeming deprived of any means of protection, been vouchsafed a  preservation little short of miraculous.    A world, torn with conflicting passions, and perilously disintegrating  from within, finds itself confronted, at so crucial an epoch in its  history, by the rising fortunes of an infant Faith, a Faith that, at  times, seems to be drawn into its controversies, entangled by its  conflicts, eclipsed by its gathering shadows, and overpowered by the  mounting tide of its passions. In its very heart, within its cradle, at  the seat of its first and venerable Temple, in one of its hitherto  flourishing and potentially powerful centers, the as-yet unemancipated  Faith of Baha'u'llah seems indeed to have retreated before the onrushing  forces of violence and disorder to which humanity is steadily falling a  victim. The strongholds of such a Faith, one by one and day after day, are  to outward seeming being successively isolated, assaulted and captured. As  the lights of liberty flicker and go out, as the din of discord grows  louder and louder every day, as the fires of fanaticism flame with  increasing fierceness in the breasts of men, as the chill of irreligion  creeps relentlessly over the soul of mankind, the limbs and organs that  constitute the body of the Faith of Baha'u'llah appear, in varying  measure, to have become afflicted with the crippling influences that now  hold in their grip the whole of the civilized world.    How clearly and strikingly the following words of 'Abdu'l-Baha are being  demonstrated at this hour: \"The darkness of error that has enveloped the  East and the West is, in this most great cycle, battling with the light of  Divine Guidance. Its swords and its spears are very sharp and pointed; its  army keenly bloodthirsty.\" \"This day,\" He, in another passage has written,  \"the powers of all the leaders of religion are directed towards the  dispersion of the congregation of the All-Merciful, and the shattering of  the Divine Edifice. The hosts of the world, whether material, cultural or  political are from every side launching their assault, for the Cause is  great, very great. Its greatness is, in this day, clear and manifest to  men's eyes.\"    The one chief remaining citadel, the mighty arm which still raises aloft  the standard of an unconquerable Faith, is none other than the blessed  community of the followers of the Most Great Name in the North American  continent. By its works, and through the unfailing protection vouchsafed  to it by an almighty Providence, this distinguished member of the body of  the constantly interacting Baha'i communities of East and West, bids fair  to be universally regarded as the cradle, as well as the stronghold, of  that future New World Order, which is at once the promise and the glory of  the Dispensation associated with the name of Baha'u'llah.    Let anyone inclined to either belittle the unique station conferred upon  this community, or to question the role it will be called upon to play in  the days to come, ponder the implication of these pregnant and highly  illuminating words uttered by 'Abdu'l-Baha, and addressed to it at a time  when the fortunes of a world groaning beneath the burden of a devastating  war had reached their lowest ebb. \"The continent of America,\" He so  significantly wrote, \"is, in the eyes of the one true God, the land  wherein the splendors of His light shall be revealed, where the mysteries  of His Faith shall be unveiled, where the righteous will abide, and the  free assemble.\"    Already, the community of the believers of the North American continent--at  once the prime mover and pattern of the future communities which the Faith  of Baha'u'llah is destined to raise up throughout the length and breadth  of the Western Hemisphere--has, despite the prevailing gloom, shown its  capacity to be recognized as the torchbearer of that light, the repository  of those mysteries, the exponent of that righteousness and the sanctuary  of that freedom. To what other light can these above-quoted words possibly  allude, if not to the light of the glory of the Golden Age of the Faith of  Baha'u'llah? What mysteries could 'Abdu'l-Baha have contemplated except  the mysteries of that embryonic World Order now evolving within the matrix  of His Administration? What righteousness if not the righteousness whose  reign that Age and that Order can alone establish? What freedom but the  freedom which the proclamation of His sovereignty in the fullness of time  must bestow?    The community of the organized promoters of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in  the American continent--the spiritual descendants of the dawn-breakers of  an heroic Age, who by their death proclaimed the birth of that Faith--must,  in turn, usher in, not by their death but through living sacrifice, that  promised World Order, the shell ordained to enshrine that priceless jewel,  the world civilization, of which the Faith itself is the sole begetter.  While its sister communities are bending beneath the tempestuous winds  that beat upon them from every side, this community, preserved by the  immutable decrees of the omnipotent Ordainer and deriving continual  sustenance from the mandate with which the Tablets of the Divine Plan have  invested it, is now busily engaged in laying the foundations and in  fostering the growth of those institutions which are to herald the  approach of the Age destined to witness the birth and rise of the World  Order of Baha'u'llah.    A community, relatively negligible in its numerical strength; separated by  vast distances from both the focal-center of its Faith and the land  wherein the preponderating mass of its fellow-believers reside; bereft in  the main of material resources and lacking in experience and in  prominence; ignorant of the beliefs, concepts and habits of those peoples  and races from which its spiritual Founders have sprung; wholly unfamiliar  with the languages in which its sacred Books were originally revealed;  constrained to place its sole reliance upon an inadequate rendering of  only a fragmentary portion of the literature embodying its laws, its  tenets, and its history; subjected from its infancy to tests of extreme  severity, involving, at times, the defection of some of its most prominent  members; having to contend, ever since its inception, and in an  ever-increasing measure, with the forces of corruption, of moral laxity,  and ingrained prejudice--such a community, in less than half a century, and  unaided by any of its sister communities, whether in the East or in the  West, has, by virtue of the celestial potency with which an all-loving  Master has abundantly endowed it, lent an impetus to the onward march of  the Cause it has espoused which the combined achievements of its  coreligionists in the West have failed to rival.    What other community, it can confidently be asked, has been instrumental  in fixing the pattern, and in imparting the original impulse, to those  administrative institutions that constitute the vanguard of the World  Order of Baha'u'llah? What other community has been capable of  demonstrating, with such consistency, the resourcefulness, the discipline,  the iron determination, the zeal and perseverance, the devotion and  fidelity, so indispensable to the erection and the continued extension of  the framework within which those nascent institutions can alone multiply  and mature? What other community has proved itself to be fired by so noble  a vision, or willing to rise to such heights of self-sacrifice, or ready  to achieve so great a measure of solidarity, as to be able to raise, in so  short a time and in the course of such crucial years, an edifice that can  well deserve to be regarded as the greatest contribution ever made by the  West to the Cause of Baha'u'llah? What other community can justifiably lay  claim to have succeeded, through the unsupported efforts of one of its  humble members, in securing the spontaneous allegiance of Royalty to its  Cause, and in winning such marvelous and written testimonies to its truth?  What other community has shown the foresight, the organizing ability, the  enthusiastic eagerness, that have been responsible for the establishment  and multiplication, throughout its territory, of those initial schools  which, as time goes by, will, on the one hand, evolve into powerful  centers of Baha'i learning, and, on the other, provide a fertile  recruiting ground for the enrichment and consolidation of its teaching  force? What other community has produced pioneers combining to such a  degree the essential qualities of audacity, of consecration, of tenacity,  of self-renunciation, and unstinted devotion, that have prompted them to  abandon their homes, and forsake their all, and scatter over the surface  of the globe, and hoist in its uttermost corners the triumphant banner of  Baha'u'llah? Who else but the members of this community have won the  eternal distinction of being the first to raise the call of Ya  Baha'u'l-Abha in such highly important and widely scattered centers and  territories as the hearts of both the British and French empires, Germany,  the Far East, the Balkan States, the Scandinavian countries, Latin  America, the Islands of the Pacific, South Africa, Australia and New  Zealand, and now more recently the Baltic States? Who else but those same  pioneers have shown themselves ready to undertake the labor, to exercise  the patience, and to provide the funds, required for the translation and  publication, in no less than forty languages, of their sacred"]]]
