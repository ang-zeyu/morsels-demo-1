I should go away very happy,  if I knew that you would be able to get on comfortably. Of course it's  a long way off, Mother, and I should have liked to stay at home, to be  a help to you and the girls; but one can't have all one wishes. As far  as I am concerned, myself, I would rather go out as a writer there,  where I shall see strange sights and a strange country, than be stuck  all my life at a desk in London.    \"What is Uncle like?\"    \"He is a short man, my dear, rather stiff and pompous, with a very  stiff cravat. He used to give me his finger to shake, when I was a  child, and I was always afraid of him. He married a most disagreeable  woman, only a year or two before I married, myself. But I heard she  died not very long afterwards;\" and so Mrs. Marryat got talking of her  early days and relations, and was quite in good spirits again, by the  time her daughters returned from school; and she told them what she  was now coming to regard as the good fortune which had befallen their  brother.    The girls were greatly affected. They adored their brother, and the  thought that he was going away for years was terrible to them. Nothing  that could be said pacified them in the slightest degree, and they did  nothing but cry, until they retired to bed. Charlie was much affected  by their sorrow; but when they had retired, he took his hat and went  out to tell the news of his approaching departure to some of his  chums.    The next day, Mrs. Marryat wrote thanking her uncle for his kindness,  and saying that Charlie would go round to London by the packet which  sailed on the following Monday; and would, if the wind were fair and  all went well, reach London on the Wednesday.    School was, of course, at once given up, and the girls also had a  holiday till their brother's departure. When the necessary clothes  were ordered, there was little more to do; and Charlie spent the time,  when his boy friends were in school, in walking with the girls along  the shore, talking to them of the future, of the presents he would  send them home, and of the life he should lead in India; while at  other times he went out with his favourite schoolfellows, and joined  in one last grand battle with the smack boys.    On Monday morning, after a sad farewell to his family, Charlie  embarked on board the Yarmouth Belle, a packet which performed the  journey to and from London once a fortnight. She was a roomy lugger,  built for stowage rather than speed, and her hold was crammed and her  deck piled with packages of salted fish. There were five or six other  persons also bound for London, the journey to which was, in those  days, regarded as an arduous undertaking.    As soon as the Yarmouth Belle issued from the mouth of the river, she  began to pitch heavily; and Charlie, who from frequently going out  with his father in the revenue cutter, was a good sailor, busied  himself in doing his best for his afflicted fellow passengers. Towards  evening the wind got up, and shifting ahead, the captain dropped  anchor off Lowestoft. The next morning was finer, and the Yarmouth  Belle continued her way. It was not, however, till Thursday afternoon  that she dropped anchor in the Pool.    Charlie was soon on shore, and giving his trunk to a porter, desired  him to lead the way to Bread Street, in which his uncle resided; for  in the last century, such things as country villas were almost  unknown, and the merchants of London for the most part resided in the  houses where they carried on their business. Keeping close to the  porter, to see that he did not make off with his trunk, for Charlie  had received many warnings as to the extreme wickedness of London, he  followed him through the busy streets, and arrived safely at his  uncle's door.    It was now dusk, and Charlie, on giving his name, was shown upstairs  to a large room, which was lighted by a fire blazing in the hearth.  Standing with his back to this was a gentleman whom he at once  recognized, from his mother's description, as her uncle, although he  was a good deal more portly than when she had seen him last.    \"So you are my grandnephew,\" he said, holding out what Charlie  considered to be a very limp and flabby hand towards him.    \"Yes, Uncle,\" Charlie said cheerfully; \"and we are very much obliged  to you, Mamma and I, for your kindness.\"    \"Humph!\" the old gentleman grunted.    \"And how is it,\" he asked severely, \"that you were not here yesterday?  My niece's letter led me to expect that you would arrive yesterday.\"    \"We came as fast as we could, Uncle,\" Charlie laughed; \"but of course  the time depends upon the wind. The captain tells me that he has been  as much as three weeks coming round.\"    Mr. Tufton grunted again as if to signify that such unpunctuality was  altogether displeasing to him.    \"You are tall,\" he said, looking up at Charlie, who stood half a head  above him, \"and thin, very thin. You have a loose way of standing,  which I don't approve of.\"    \"I'm sorry I'm loose, sir,\" Charlie said gravely, \"if you do not  approve of it; but you see, running about and playing games make one  lissome. I suppose, now that's all over and I am going to spend my  time in writing, I shall get stiffer.\"    \"I hope so, I hope so,\" Mr. Tufton said encouragingly, and as if  stiffness were one of the most desirable things in life. \"I like to  see young men with a sedate bearing.    \"And you left my niece and grandnieces well, I hope?\"    \"Quite well, thank you, sir,\" Charlie said; \"but, of course, a good  deal upset with parting from me.\"    \"Yes,\" Mr. Tufton said; \"I suppose so. Women are so emotional. Now  there's nothing I object to more than emotion.\"    As Charlie thought that this was probably the case, he was silent,  although the idea vaguely occurred to him that he should like to  excite a little emotion in his uncle, by the sudden insertion of a  pin, or some other such means. The silence continued for some little  time, and then Mr. Tufton said:    \"I always dine at two o'clock; but as probably you are hungry--I have  observed that boys always are hungry--some food will be served you in  the next room. I had already given my housekeeper orders. No doubt you  will find it prepared. After that, you may like to take a walk in the  streets. I have supper at nine, by which hour you will, of course,  have returned.\"    Charlie, as he ate his meal, thought to himself that his uncle was a  pompous old gentleman, and that it would be very hard work getting on  with him, for the next three weeks. However, he consoled himself by  the thought:    \"Kind is as kind does after all, and I expect the old gentleman is not  as crusty as he looks.\"    Charlie had handed to Mr. Tufton a letter which his mother had given  him, and when he returned from a ramble through the streets, he found  that gentleman sitting by the fire, with lights upon a small table  beside him. Upon this Mrs. Marryat's letter lay open.    \"So you have soon become tired of the streets of London, Grandnephew!\"  he said.    \"There is not much to see, sir. The lamps do not burn very brightly,  and the fog is coming on. I thought that, if it grew thicker, I might  lose my way, and in that case I might not have been in at the hour you  named for supper.\"    \"Humph!\" the other gentleman grunted. \"So your mother has taught you  to be punctual to meals. But, no; boys' appetites teach them to be  punctual then, if never at any other time.    \"And why, sir?\" he asked severely, \"Did my niece not write to me  before?\"    \"I don't know, sir,\" Charlie said. \"I suppose she did not like--that  is, she didn't think--that is--\"    \"Think, sir! Like, sir!\" said his uncle. \"What right had she either to  think or to like? Her duty clearly was to have made me acquainted, at  once, with all the circumstances. I suppose I had a right to say  whether I approved of my grandnieces going tramping about the world as  governesses, or not. It isn't because a woman chooses, by her folly,  to separate herself from her family, that they are to be deprived of  their rights in a matter of this kind. Eh, sir, what do you say to  that?\" and Mr. Tufton looked very angry, indeed.    \"I don't know, sir,\" Charlie said. \"I have never thought the matter  over.\"    \"Why, sir, suppose she had made you a tinker, sir, and you turned out  a thief, as likely as not you would have done, and you'd been hung,  sir, what then? Am I to have such discredit as this brought upon me,  without my having any option in the matter?\"    \"I suppose not, sir,\" Charlie said. \"I hope I shouldn't have turned  out a thief, even if I'd been a tinker; but perhaps it was because my  mother feared that this might be the case, that she did give you the  option.\"    His uncle looked at him keenly; but Charlie, though with some  difficulty, maintained the gravest face.    \"It is well she did so,\" Mr. Tufton said; \"very well. If she had not  done so, I should have known the reason why. And you, sir, do you like  the thought of going to India?\"    \"Yes, Uncle, I like the thought very much, though I would rather, if I  may say so, have gone as a cadet.\"    \"I thought so,\" Mr. Tufton said, sarcastically. \"I was sure of it. You  wanted to wear a red coat and a sword, and to swagger about the  streets of Calcutta, instead of making an honorable living and  acquiring a fortune.\"    \"I don't think, sir,\" Charlie said, \"that the idea of the red coat and  sword entered into my mind; but it seemed to me the choice of a life  of activity and adventure, against one as a mere clerk.\"    \"Had you entered the military service of the Company, even if you  didn't get shot, you could only hope to rise to the command of a  regiment, ranking with a civilian very low down on the list.

His aliquantum itineris  progressis, cum iam extremi essent in prospectu, equites a Quinto Atrio  ad Caesarem venerunt, qui nuntiarent superiore nocte maxima coorta  tempestate prope omnes naves adflictas atque in litore eiectas esse,  quod neque ancorae funesque subsisterent, neque nautae gubernatoresque  vim tempestatis pati possent; itaque ex eo concursu navium magnum esse  incommodum acceptum.      11    His rebus cognitis Caesar legiones equitatumque revocari atque in  itinere resistere iubet, ipse ad naves revertitur; eadem fere quae ex  nuntiis litterisque cognoverat coram perspicit, sic ut amissis circiter  XL navibus reliquae tamen refici posse magno negotio viderentur. Itaque  ex legionibus fabros deligit et ex continenti alios arcessi iubet;  Labieno scribit, ut quam plurimas posset eis legionibus, quae sunt apud  eum, naves instituat. Ipse, etsi res erat multae operae ac laboris,  tamen commodissimum esse statuit omnes naves subduci et cum castris una  munitione coniungi. In his rebus circiter dies X consumit ne nocturnis  quidem temporibus ad laborem militum intermissis. Subductis navibus  castrisque egregie munitis easdem copias, quas ante, praesidio navibus  reliquit: ipse eodem unde redierat proficiscitur. Eo cum venisset,  maiores iam undique in eum locum copiae Britannorum convenerant summa  imperi bellique administrandi communi consilio permissa Cassivellauno,  cuius fines a maritimis civitatibus fiumen dividit, quod appellatur  Tamesis, a mari circiter milia passuum LXXX. Huic superiore tempore cum  reliquis civitatibus continentia bella intercesserant; sed nostro  adventu permoti Britanni hunc toti bello imperioque praefeceraut.      12    Britanniae pars interior ab eis incolitur quos natos in insula ipsi  memoria proditum dicunt, maritima ab eis, qui praedae ac belli inferendi  causa ex Belgio transierunt (qui omnes fere eis nominibus civitatum  appellantur, quibus orti ex civitatibus eo pervenerunt) et bello illato  ibi permanserunt atque agros colere coeperunt. Hominum est infinita  multitudo creberrimaque aedificia fere Gallicis consimilia, pecorum  magnus numerus. Vtuntur aut aere aut nummo aureo aut taleis ferreis ad  certum pondus examinatis pro nummo. Nascitur ibi plumbum album in  mediterraneis regionibus, in maritimis ferrum, sed eius exigua est  copia; aere utuntur importato. Materia cuiusque generis ut in Gallia  est, praeter fagum atque abietem. Leporem et gallinam et anserem gustare  fas non putant; haec tamen alunt animi voluptatisque causa. Loca sunt  temperatiora quam in Gallia, remissioribus frigoribus.      13    Insula natura triquetra, cuius unum latus est contra Galliam. Huius  lateris alter angulus, qui est ad Cantium, quo fere omnes ex Gallia  naves appelluntur, ad orientem solem, inferior ad meridiem spectat. Hoc  pertinet circiter mila passuum quingenta. Alterum vergit ad Hispaniam  atque occidentem solem; qua ex parte est Hibernia, dimidio minor, ut  aestimatur, quam Britannia, sed pari spatio transmissus atque ex Gallia  est in Britanniam. In hoc medio cursu est insula, quae appellatur Mona:  complures praeterea minores subiectae insulae existimantur, de quibus  insulis nonnulli scripserunt dies continuos triginta sub bruma esse  noctem. Nos nihil de eo percontationibus reperiebamus, nisi certis ex  aqua mensuris breviores esse quam in continenti noctes videbamus. Huius  est longitudo lateris, ut fert illorum opinio, septingentorum milium.  Tertium est contra septentriones; cui parti nulla est obiecta terra, sed  eius angulus lateris maxime ad Germaniam spectat. Hoc milia passuum  octingenta in longitudinem esse existimatur. Ita omnis insula est in  circuitu vicies centum milium passuum.      14    Ex his omnibus longe sunt humanissimi qui Cantium incolunt, quae regio  est maritima omnis, neque multum a Gallica differunt consuetudine.  Interiores plerique frumenta non serunt, sed lacte et carne vivunt  pellibusque sunt vestiti. Omnes vero se Britanni vitro inficiunt, quod  caeruleum efficit colorem, atque hoc horridiores sunt in pugna aspectu;  capilloque sunt promisso atque omni parte corporis rasa praeter caput et  labrum superius. Vxores habent deni duodenique inter se communes et  maxime fratres cum fratribus parentesque cum liberis; sed qui sunt ex  his nati, eorum habentur liberi, quo primum virgo quaeque deducta est.      15    Equites hostium essedariique acriter proelio cum equitatu nostro in  itinere conflixerunt, tamen ut nostri omnibus partibus superiores  fuerint atque eos in silvas collesque compulerint; sed compluribus  interfectis cupidius insecuti nonnullos ex suis amiserunt. At illi  intermisso spatio imprudentibus nostris atque occupatis in munitione  castrorum subito se ex statione pro castris collocati, acriter  pugnaverunt, duabusque missis subsidio cohortibus a Caesare atque eis  primis legionum duarum, cum hae perexiguo intermisso loci spatio inter  se constitissent, novo genere pugnae perterritis nostris per medios  audacissime perruperunt seque inde incolumes receperunt. Eo die Quintus  Laberius Durus, tribunus militum, interficitur. Illi pluribus submissis  cohortibus repelluntur.      16    Toto hoc in genere pugnae, cum sub oculis omnium ac pro castris  dimicaretur, intellectum est nostros propter gravitatem armorum, quod  neque insequi cedentes possent neque ab signis discedere auderent, minus  aptos esse ad huius generis hostem, equites autem magno cum periculo  proelio dimicare, propterea quod illi etiam consulto plerumque cederent  et, cum paulum ab legionibus nostros removissent, ex essedis desilirent  et pedibus dispari proelio contenderent. Equestris autem proeli ratio et  cedentibus et insequentibus par atque idem periculum inferebat.  Accedebat huc ut numquam conferti sed rari magnisque intervallis  proeliarentur stationesque dispositas haberent, atque alios alii  deinceps exciperent, integrique et recentes defetigatis succederent.      17    Postero die procul a castris hostes in collibus constiterunt rarique se  ostendere et lenius quam pridie nostros equites proelio lacessere  coeperunt. Sed meridie, cum Caesar pabulandi causa tres legiones atque  omnem equitatum cum Gaio Trebonio legato misisset, repente ex omnibus  partibus ad pabulatores advolaverunt, sic uti ab signis legionibusque  non absisterent. Nostri acriter in eos impetu facto reppulerunt neque  finem sequendi fecerunt, quoad subsidio confisi equites, cum post se  legiones viderent, praecipites hostes egerunt magnoque eorum numero  interfecto neque sui colligendi neque consistendi aut ex essedis  desiliendi facultatem dederunt. Ex hac fuga protinus, quae undique  convenerant, auxilia discesserunt, neque post id tempus umquam summis  nobiscum copiis hostes contenderunt.      18    Caesar cognito consilio eorum ad flumen Tamesim in fines Cassivellauni  exercitum duxit; quod flumen uno omnino loco pedibus, atque hoc aegre,  transiri potest. Eo cum venisset, animum advertit ad alteram fluminis  ripam magnas esse copias hostium instructas. Ripa autem erat acutis  sudibus praefixis munita, eiusdemque generis sub aqua defixae sudes  flumine tegebantur. His rebus cognitis a captivis perfugisque Caesar  praemisso equitatu confestim legiones subsequi iussit. Sed ea celeritate  atque eo impetu milites ierunt, cum capite solo ex aqua exstarent, ut  hostes impetum legionum atque equitum sustinere non possent ripasque  dimitterent ac se fugae mandarent.      19    Cassivellaunus, ut supra demonstravimus, omni deposita spe contentionis  dimissis amplioribus copiis milibus circiter quattuor essedariorum  relictis itinera nostra servabat paulumque ex via excedebat locisque  impeditis ac silvestribus sese occultabat, atque eis regionibus quibus  nos iter facturos cognoverat pecora atque homines ex agris in silvas  compellebat et, cum equitatus noster liberius praedandi vastandique  causa se in agros eiecerat, omnibus viis semitisque essedarios ex silvis  emittebat et magno cum periculo nostrorum equitum cum eis confligebat  atque hoc metu latius vagari prohibebat. Relinquebatur ut neque longius  ab agmine legionum discedi Caesar pateretur, et tantum in agris  vastandis incendiisque faciendis hostibus noceretur, quantum labore  atque itinere legionarii milites efficere poterant.      20    Interim Trinobantes, prope firmissima earum regionum civitas, ex qua  Mandubracius adulescens Caesaris fidem secutus ad eum in continentem  Galliam venerat, cuius pater in ea civitate regnum obtinuerat  interfectusque erat a Cassivellauno, ipse fuga mortem vitaverat, legatos  ad Caesarem mittunt pollicenturque sese ei dedituros atque imperata  facturos; petunt, ut Mandubracium ab iniuria Cassivellauni defendat  atque in civitatem mittat, qui praesit imperiumque obtineat. His Caesar  imperat obsides quadraginta frumentumque exercitui Mandubraciumque ad  eos mittit. Illi imperata celeriter fecerunt, obsides ad numerum  frumentumque miserunt.      21    Trinobantibus defensis adque ab omni militum niuria prohibitis  Cenimagni, Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bibroci, Cassi legationibus missis  sese Caesari dedumt. Ab his cognoscit non longe ex eo loco oppidum  Cassivellauni abesse silvis paludibusque munitum, quo satis magnus  hominum pecorisque numerus onvenerit. Oppidum autem Britanni vocant, cum  silvas impeditas vallo atque fossa munierunt, quo incursionis hostium  vitandae causa convenire consuerunt. Eo proficiscitur cum legionibus:  locum reperit egregie natura atque opere munitum; tamen hunc duabus ex  partibus oppugnare contendit. Hostes paulisper morati militum nostrorum  impetum non tulerunt seseque alia ex parte oppidi eiecerunt. Magnus ibi  numerus pecoris repertus, multique in fuga sunt comprehensi atque  interfecti.      22    Dum haec in his locis geruntur, Cassivellaunus ad Cantium, quod esse ad  mare supra"]]]
