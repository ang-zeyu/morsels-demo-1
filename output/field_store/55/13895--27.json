He was incredibly gaunt, so that the suit of  tropical twill which he wore hung upon him in folds, showing if such  evidence were necessary, how terribly he was fallen away from his  constitutional habit. He wore a beard of at least ten days' growth,  which served to accentuate the cavitous hollowness of his face. His  eyes seemed starting from their sockets as he lay upon his back  uttering inarticulate sounds and plucking with skinny fingers at his  lips.    Smith bent forward peering into the wasted face; and then started back  with a suppressed cry.    \"Merciful God! can it be Hale?\" he muttered. \"What does it mean? what  does it mean?\"    I ran to the opposite side of the bed, and placing my arms under the  writhing man, raised him and propped a pillow at his back. He  continued to babble, rolling his eyes from side to side hideously;  then by degrees they seemed to become less glazed, and a light of  returning sanity entered them. They became fixed; and they were fixed  upon Nayland Smith, who bending over the bed, was watching Sir Gregory  (for Sir Gregory I concluded this pitiable wreck to be) with an  expression upon his face compound of many emotions.    \"A glass of water,\" I said, catching the glance of the man Beeton,  who stood trembling at the open doorway.    Spilling a liberal quantity upon the carpet, Beeton ultimately  succeeded in conveying the glass to me. Hale, never taking his gaze  from Smith, gulped a little of the water and then thrust my hand away.  As I turned to place the tumbler upon a small table the resumed the  wordless babbling, and now, with his index finger, pointed to his  mouth.    \"He has lost the power of speech!\" whispered Smith.    \"He was stricken dumb, gentlemen, ten minutes ago,\" said Beeton in a  trembling voice. \"He dropped off to sleep out there on the floor, and  I brought him in here and laid him on the bed. When he woke up he was  like that!\"    The man on the bed ceased his inchoate babbling and now, gulping  noisily, began to make quick nervous movements with his hands.    \"He wants to write something,\" said Smith in a low voice. \"Quick! hold  him up!\" He thrust his notebook, open at a blank page, before the man  whose movement were numbered, and placed a pencil in the shaking  right hand.    Faintly and unevenly Sir Gregory commenced to write--whilst I  supported him. Across the bent shoulders Smith silently questioned me,  and my reply was a negative shake of the head.    The lamp above the bed was swaying as if in a heavy draught; I  remembered that it had been swaying as we entered. There was no fog in  the room, but already from the bleak corridor outside it was entering;  murky, yellow clouds steaming in at the open door. Save for the gulping  of the dying man, and the sobbing breaths of Beeton, there was no  sound. Six irregular lines Sir Gregory Hale scrawled upon the page;  then suddenly his body became a dead weight in my arms. Gently I laid  him back upon the pillows, gently his finger from the notebook, and,  my head almost touching Smith's as we both craned forward over the  page, read, with great difficulty, the following:--      \"Guard my diary.... Tibetan frontier ... Key of India. Beware man ...    with the limp. Yellow ... rising.   Watch Tibet ... the _Si-Fan_....\"    From somewhere outside the room, whether above or below I could not be  sure, came a faint, dragging sound, accompanied by a _tap--tap--tap_....        CHAPTER III    \"SAKYA MUNI\"      The faint disturbance faded into silence again. Across the dead man's  body I met Smith's gaze. Faint wreaths of fog floated in from the  outer room. Beeton clutched the foot of the bed, and the structure  shook in sympathy with his wild trembling. That was the only sound  now; there was absolutely nothing physical so far as my memory serves  to signalize the coming of the brown man.    Yet, stealthy as his approach had been, something must have warned us.  For suddenly, with one accord, we three turned upon the bed, and  stared out into the room from which the fog wreaths floated in.    Beeton stood nearest to the door, but, although he turned, he did not  go out, but with a smothered cry crouched back against the bed. Smith  it was who moved first, then I followed, and close upon his heels  burst into the disordered sitting-room. The outer door had been closed  but not bolted, and what with the tinted light, diffused through the  silken Japanese shade, and the presence of fog in the room, I was  almost tempted to believe myself the victim of a delusion. What I saw  or thought I saw was this:--    A tall screen stood immediately inside the door, and around its end,  like some materialization of the choking mist, glided a lithe, yellow  figure, a slim, crouching figure, wearing a sort of loose robe. An  impression I had of jet-black hair, protruding from beneath a little  cap, of finely chiseled features and great, luminous eyes, then, with  no sound to tell of a door opened or shut, the apparition was gone.    \"You saw him, Petrie!--you saw him!\" cried Smith.    In three bounds he was across the room, had tossed the screen aside  and thrown open the door. Out he sprang into the yellow haze of the  corridor, tripped, and, uttering a cry of pain, fell sprawling upon  the marble floor. Hot with apprehension I joined him, but he looked  up with a wry smile and began furiously rubbing his left shin.    \"A queer trick, Petrie,\" he said, rising to his feet; \"but  nevertheless effective.\"    He pointed to the object which had occasioned his fall. It was a small  metal chest, evidently of very considerable weight, and it stood  immediately outside the door of Number 14a.    \"That was what he came for, sir! That was what he came for! You were  too quick for him!\"    Beeton stood behind us, his horror-bright eyes fixed upon the box.    \"Eh?\" rapped Smith, turning upon him.    \"That's what Sir Gregory brought to England,\" the man ran on almost  hysterically; \"that's what he's been guarding this past two weeks,  night and day, crouching over it with a loaded pistol. That's what  cost him his life, sir. He's had no peace, day or night, since he  got it....\"    We were inside the room again now, Smith bearing the coffer in his  arms, and still the man ran on:    \"He's never slept for more than an hour at a time, that I know of, for  weeks past. Since the day we came here he hasn't spoken to another  living soul, and he's lain there on the floor at night with his head  on that brass box, and sat watching over it all day.\"    \"'Beeton!' he'd cry out, perhaps in the middle of the night--'Beeton--  do you hear that damned woman!' But although I'd begun to think I  could hear something, I believe it was the constant strain working on  my nerves and nothing else at all.    \"Then he was always listening out for some one he called 'the man with  the limp.' Five and six times a night he'd have me up to listen with  him. 'There he goes, Beeton!' he'd whisper, crouching with his ear  pressed flat to the door. 'Do you hear him dragging himself along?'    \"God knows how I've stood it as I have; for I've known no peace since  we left China. Once we got here I thought it would be better, but it's  been worse.    \"Gentlemen have come (from the India Office, I believe), but he would  not see them. Said he would see no one but Mr. Nayland Smith. He had  never lain in his bed until to-night, but what with taking no proper  food nor sleep, and some secret trouble that was killing him by inches,  he collapsed altogether a while ago, and I carried him in and laid him  on the bed as I told you. Now he's dead--now he's dead.\"    Beeton leant up against the mantelpiece and buried his face in his  hands, whilst his shoulders shook convulsively. He had evidently been  greatly attached to his master, and I found something very pathetic in  this breakdown of a physically strong man. Smith laid his hands upon  his shoulders.    \"You have passed through a very trying ordeal,\" he said, \"and no man  could have done his duty better; but forces beyond your control have  proved too strong for you. I am Nayland Smith.\"    The man spun around with a surprising expression of relief upon his  pale face.    \"So that whatever can be done,\" continued my friend, \"to carry out  your master's wishes, will be done now. Rely upon it. Go into your  room and lie down until we call you.\"    \"Thank you, sir, and thank God you are here,\" said Beeton dazedly, and  with one hand raised to his head he went, obediently, to the smaller  bedroom and disappeared within.    \"Now, Petrie,\" rapped Smith, glancing around the littered floor,  \"since I am empowered to deal with this matter as I see fit, and since  you are a medical man, we can devote the next half-hour, at any rate,  to a strictly confidential inquiry into this most perplexing case. I  propose that you examine the body for any evidences that may assist  you determining the cause of death, whilst I make a few inquiries here.\"    I nodded, without speaking, and went into the bedroom. It contained not  one solitary item of the dead man's belongings, and in every way bore  out Beeton's statement that Sir Gregory had never inhabited it. I bent  over Hale, as he lay fully dressed upon the bed.    Saving the singularity of the symptom which had immediately preceded  death--viz., the paralysis of the muscles of articulation--I should  have felt disposed to ascribe his end to sheer inanition; and a  cursory examination brought to light nothing contradictory to that  view. Not being prepared to proceed further in the matter at the moment  I was about to rejoin Smith, whom I could hear rummaging about amongst  the litter of the outer room, when I made a curious discovery.    Lying in a fold of the disordered bed linen were a few petals of some  kind of blossom, three of them still attached to a fragment of slender  stalk.    I collected the tiny petals, mechanically, and held them in the palm  of my hand"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17966"],[0,"Life History of the Kangaroo Rat (#2)"],[1,"two; (_b_) the pocket mice (_Perognathus_), which are considerably  smaller than the kangaroo rats and lack the conspicuous white hip  stripe possessed by all the latter; and (_c_) the kangaroo rats  (_Dipodomys_).    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Range, east of the Colorado River, of _Dipodomys  spectabilis spectabilis_ compared with that of _Dipodomys merriami_.  Cross hatching indicates area of overlapping of the two forms. The range  of _Dipodomys deserti_, not shown on the map, is west of that of  _spectabilis_, and so far as known the two do not overlap.]    _Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam requires comparison with  three other forms of kangaroo rats in the same general region, namely,  _D. deserti_ Stephens, of approximately the same size, and _D. merriami_  Mearns and _D. ordii_ Woodhouse, the last two of decidedly smaller size.  The range of _deserti_ lies principally to the west of that of  _spectabilis_, and the two do not, so far as known, overlap. On the  other hand, _merriami_ and _ordii_, and subspecies, occur over a large  part of the range of _spectabilis_, living in very close proximity to  its burrows; _merriami_ is even suspected of pillaging the stores of  _spectabilis_. The range of _merriami_, however, is much more extensive  than that of _spectabilis_ (Fig. 1), which argues against a definite  ecological dependence or relationship. Separation of the four forms  mentioned may be easily accomplished by the following key:    _Key to Species of_ Dipodomys _in Arizona._    _a^1_. Size much larger (hind foot and greatest length of skull more  than 42 millimeters); tail tipped with white.         _b^1_. Upper parts dark brownish buffy; tail dark brownish or       blackish with more sharply contrasted white tip; interparietal       broader, distinctly separating mastoids (range in Arizona mainly       southeastern part)                          =Dipodomys spectabilis.=         _b^2_. Upper parts light ochraceous-buffy; tail pale brownish with       less sharply contrasted white tip; interparietal narrower, reduced       to mere spicule between mastoids (range in Arizona mainly       southwestern part)                              =Dipodomys deserti.=    _a^2_. Size much smaller (hind foot and greatest length of skull less  than 42 millimeters); tail not tipped with white.         _b^1_. Hind foot with four toes                =Dipodomys merriami.=         _b^2_. Hind foot with five toes                   =Dipodomys ordii.=    On account of the small size, _merriami_ and _ordii_ do not require  detailed color comparison with the other two. The general color of the  upperparts of _spectabilis_ is much darker than that of _deserti_;  whereas _spectabilis_ is ochraceous-buff or light ochraceous-buff  grizzled with blackish, _deserti_ is near pale ochraceous-buff and lacks  the blackish.    The color of the upperparts alone amply suffices to distinguish  _spectabilis_ and _deserti_; but the different coloration of the tail is  the most obvious diagnostic feature. The near black of the middle  portion of the tail, the conspicuous white side stripes, and the pure  white tip make the tail of _spectabilis_ stand in rather vivid contrast  to the pale-brown and whitish tail of _deserti_.    The dens of the two larger species of _Dipodomys_--_spectabilis_ and  _deserti_--can be distinguished at a glance from those of the two  smaller--_merriami_ and _ordii_--by the fact that the mounds of the  former are usually of considerable size and the burrow mouths are of  greater diameter. On the Range Reserve _merriami_ erects no mounds, but  excavates its burrows in the open or at the base of _Prosopis_,  _Lycium_, or other brush. The mounds of _spectabilis_ are higher than  those of _deserti_, the entrances are larger, and they are located in  harder soil (Pl. III, Fig. 1). The dens of _deserti_ are usually more  extensive in surface area than those of _spectabilis_, and have a  greater number of openings (Pl. III, Fig. 2).      [Illustration: PLATE II.

This is  typical of a large section of country occupied by _Dipodomys spectabilis  spectabilis_ and _Dipodomys merriami_. The brush is mesquite  (_Prosopis_), cat's-claw (_Acacia_), and paloverde (_Cercidium_).]    [Illustration: PLATE II. FIG. 2.--KANGAROO RAT COUNTRY FOLLOWING SUMMER  DROUGHT.    An area of the U. S.

Size large; ears moderate, ear from crown (taken in dry skin) 9 or 10  millimeters; eyes prominent; whiskers long and sensitive; fore feet  short and weak; hind feet long and powerful, provided with four  well-developed toes; tail very long, usually 30 to 40 per cent longer  than the body. Cranium triangular, the occiput forming the base and the  point of the nose the apex of the triangle, much flattened, auditory and  particularly mastoid bullae conspicuously inflated.      COLOR.    General color above, brownish buffy, varying in some specimens to  lighter buffy tints, grizzled with black; oblique hip stripes white;  tail with dark-brown or blackish stripes above and below, running into  blackish about halfway between base and tip, and with two lateral side  stripes of white to a point about halfway back; tail tipped with pure  white for about 40 millimeters (Pl. I). Underparts white, hairs white to  bases, with some plumbeous and buffy hairs about base of tail; fore legs  and fore feet white all around; hind legs like back, brown above, hairs  with gray bases, becoming blackish (fuscous-black or chaetura-black)  about ankles, hairs on under side white to bases; hind feet white above,  dark-brown or blackish (near fuscous) below.    Color variations in a series of 12 specimens from the type locality and  points widely scattered through the range of _spectabilis_ consist in  minor modifications of the degree of coloration, length of white tip of  tail, and length of white lateral tail stripes. In general the color  pattern and characters are remarkably uniform. Young specimens, while  exhibiting the color pattern and general color of adults, are  conspicuously less brown, and more grayish.    There appears to be little variation in color with season. In the series  at hand, most specimens taken during the fall, winter, and spring are  very slightly browner than those of summer, suggesting that the fresh  pelage following the fall molt is a little brighter than is the pelage  after being worn all winter and into the following summer. But at most  the difference is slight.      OIL GLAND.    Upon separating the hairs of the middle region of the back about a third  of the distance between the ears and the rump, one uncovers a prominent  gland, elliptical in outline, with long axis longitudinal and about 9  millimeters in length. The gland presents a roughened and granular  appearance, and fewer hairs grow upon it than elsewhere on the back. The  hairs in the vicinity are frequently matted, as if with a secretion. In  worn stage of pelage the gland may be visible from above without  separating the hairs. Bailey has suggested that this functions as an oil  gland for dressing the fur, and our observations bear out this view.  Kangaroo rats kept in captivity without earth or sand soon come to have  a bedraggled appearance, as if the pelage were moist. When supplied with  fine, dusty sand, they soon recover their normal sleek appearance.  Apparently the former condition is due to an excess of oil, the latter  to the absorption of the excess in a dust bath. The oil is doubtless an  important adjunct to the preservation of the skin and hair amid the  dusty surroundings in which the animal lives.      MEASUREMENTS AND WEIGHTS.    External measurements include: _Total length_, from tip of nose to tip  of tail without hairs, measured before skinning; _tail vertebrae_, length  of tail from point in angle when tail is bent at right angles to body to  tip of tail without hairs; and _hind foot_, from heel to tip of longest  claw.
