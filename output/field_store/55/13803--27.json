It was not  pride rebuking pride; it was the ever-present fact which would not  have been worth mentioning but for the suggestion of the antithesis.  He too was a shepherd, and is--a peasant. It may be that he knows  what would be right and good for his people, and it may be not; but  it is sure that he realizes that to educate would be to emancipate,  to broaden their views would be to break down the defences of their  prejudices, to let in the new leaven would be to spoil the old bread,  to give unto all men the rights of men would be to swamp for ever the  party which is to him greater than the State. When one thinks on the  one-century history of the people, much is seen that accounts for  their extraordinary love of isolation, and their ingrained and  passionate aversion to control; much too that draws to them a world  of sympathy. And when one realizes the old Dopper President hemmed in  once more by the hurrying tide of civilization, from which his people  have fled for generations--trying to fight both fate and  Nature--standing up to stem a tide as resistless as the eternal  sea--one sees the pathos of the picture. But this is as another  generation may see it.    To-day we are too close--so close that the meaner details, the  insincerity, the injustice, the barbarity--all the unlovely touches  that will by-and-by be forgotten--sponged away by the gentle hand of  time, when only the picturesque will remain.    In order to understand the deep, ineradicable aversion to English  rule which is in the heart and the blood and the bones of every Boer,  and of a great many of their kindred who are themselves British  subjects, one must recall the conditions under which the Dutch came  under British rule. When, in 1814, the Cape was finally ceded to  England, it had been twice acquired and held by conquest. The  colonists were practically all Dutch, or Huguenots who had adopted  Dutch as their language, and South Africa as their home. In any case  they were people who, by tradition, teaching and experience, must  have regarded the English as their enemies; people in whom there must  have been roused bitter resentment against being handed over with the  land to their traditional enemies. Were they serfs or subjects? has  been asked on their behalf. Had Holland the right, the power, over  freemen born, to say to them, 'You are our subjects, on our soil, and  we have transferred the soil and with it your allegiance to England,  whose sovereignty you will not be free to repudiate.' The Dutch  colonist said 'No.' The English Government and the laws of the day  said 'Yes.'    Early in the century the Boers began to trek away from the sphere of  British rule. They were trekkers before that, indeed. Even in the  days of Van Riebeck (1650) they had trekked away from the crowded  parts, and opened up with the rifle and the plough new reaches of  country; pioneering in a rough but most effective way, driving back  the savage races, and clearing the way for civilization. There is,  however, a great difference to be noted between the early treks of  the emigrants and the treks 'from British rule.' In the former (with  few exceptions) they went, knowing that their Government would follow  them, and even anxious to have its support and its representatives;  and the people who formed their migrating parties were those who had  no or insufficient land in the settled parts, those who were starting  life on their own account, or those whose families could not be  located and provided for in the cramped circumstances of the more  occupied parts. In the other case, rich and poor, old and young,  went off as in the days and in the fashion of Moses or Abraham. They  went without leave or help of the Government; secretly or openly  they went, and they asked nothing but to be left alone. They left  their homes, their people, the protection of an established  Government and a rough civilization, and went out into the unknown.  And they had, as it appeared to them, and as it will appear to many  others, good reasons for taking so grave a step. For, although the  colonists of South Africa enjoyed better government, and infinitely  more liberty, under British rule, than they had under the tyrannical  _regime_ of the Dutch East India Company twenty years before  (against which the Boers had twice risen in rebellion) there were  many things which were not as they should have been. A generation  had grown up which knew nothing of the arbitrary and oppressive rule  of the old Dutch Company. Simple folks have long memories, and all  the world over injuries make a deeper and more lasting impression  than benefits; and the older generation of Boers, which could recall  a condition of things contrasting unpleasantly with British rule,  also remembered the executions of Slagters Nek--a vindication of the  law which, when all allowance has been made for disturbed times, and  the need of strong measures to stop rebellion in a newly-acquired  country, seems to us to-day to have been harsh, unnecessary, and  unwise in policy, and truly terrible in the manner of fulfilment.    The Boers have produced from their own ranks no literary champion to  plead or defend their cause, and their earlier history is therefore  little known, and often misunderstood; but to their aid has come Mr.  George McCall Theal, the South African historian, whose years of  laborious research have rescued for South Africa much that would  otherwise have been lost. In his 'History of the Boers' Mr. Theal  records the causes of the great emigration, and shows how the Boers  stood up for fair treatment, and fought the cause, not of Boers  alone, but of all colonists. Boers and British were alike harshly and  ignorantly treated by high-handed Governors, and an ill-informed and  prejudiced Colonial Office, who made no distinction on the grounds  of nationality between the two; for we read that Englishmen had been  expelled the country, thrown in gaol, had their property  confiscated, and their newspapers suppressed for asserting their  independence, and for trifling breaches of harsh laws. The following  extract gives the best possible synopsis of the causes, and should  whet an appetite which can be gratified by the purchase of Mr.  Theal's book:    Why, then, did these men abandon their homes, sacrifice whatever  property could not be carried away, and flee from English rule as  from the most hateful tyranny? The causes are stated in a great mass  of correspondence addressed by them to the Colonial Government, and  now preserved, with other colonial records, in declarations published  by some of them before leaving, in letters to their relatives and to  newspapers, and in hundreds of pages of printed matter, prepared by  friendly and hostile hands. The declaration of one of the ablest men  among them assigns the following as the motives of himself and the  party that went with him:      'GRAHAM'S TOWN,    '_January 22, 1837_    '1. We despair of saving the colony from those evils which threaten  it by the turbulent and dishonest conduct of vagrants who are allowed  to infest the country in every part; nor do we see any prospect of  peace or happiness for our children in a country thus distracted by  internal commotions.    '2. We complain of the severe losses which we have been forced to  sustain by the emancipation of our slaves, and the vexatious laws  which have been enacted respecting them.    '3. We complain of the continual system of plunder which we have for  years endured from the Kaffirs and other coloured classes, and  particularly by the last invasion of the colony, which has desolated  the frontier districts, and ruined most of the inhabitants.    '4. We complain of the unjustifiable odium which has been cast upon  us by interested and dishonest persons, under the name of religion,  whose testimony is believed in England, to the exclusion of all  evidence in our favour; and we can foresee, as the result of this  prejudice, nothing but the total ruin of the country.    '5. We are resolved, wherever we go, that we will uphold the just  principles of liberty; but, whilst we will take care that no one is  brought by us into a condition of slavery, we will establish such  regulations as may suppress crime, and preserve proper relations  between master and servant.    '6. We solemnly declare that we leave this colony with a desire to  enjoy a quieter life than we have hitherto had. We will not molest  any people, nor deprive them of the smallest property; but, if  attacked, we shall consider ourselves fully justified in defending  our persons and effects, to the utmost of our ability, against every  enemy.    '7. We make known that when we shall have framed a code of laws for  our guidance, copies shall be forwarded to this colony for general  information; but we take the opportunity of stating that it is our  firm resolve to make provision for the summary punishment, even with  death, of all traitors, without exception, who may be found amongst  us.    '8. We purpose, in the course of our journey, and on arrival at the  country in which we shall permanently reside, to make known to the  native tribes our intentions, and our desire to live in peace and  friendly intercourse with them.    '9. We quit this colony under the full assurance that the English  Government has nothing more to require of us, and will allow us to  govern ourselves without its interference in future.    '10. We are now leaving the fruitful land of our birth, in which we  have suffered enormous losses and continual vexation, and are about  to enter a strange and dangerous territory; but we go with a firm  reliance on an all-seeing, just, and merciful God, whom we shall  always fear, and humbly endeavour to obey.    'In the name of all who leave the colony with me,      'P. RETIEF.'    But formal declarations such as the above are not in all instances to  be trusted.

[Sidenote: _Gen. 2._]  Samothes the sixt begotten sonne of Iaphet called by Moses Mesech, by  [Sidenote: _De migr. gen._]  others Dis, receiued for his portion (according to the report of  Wolfgangus Lazius) all the countrie lieng betweene the riuer of Rhene  and the Pyrenian mountains, where he founded the kingdome of Celtica  [Sidenote: _Cent. 1._]  ouer his people called Celtae. Which name Bale affirmeth to haue bene  indifferent to the inhabitants both of the countrie of Gallia, and the  Ile of Britaine, & that he planted colonies of men (brought foorth of  the east parts) in either of them, first in the maine land, and after  [Sidenote: _Anti. lib._ 1.  _Bale Script_.  _Brit. cent._ 1.]  in the Iland. He is reported by Berosus to haue excelled all men of  that age in learning and knowledge: and also is thought by Bale to  haue imparted the same among his people; namelie, the vnderstanding  [Sidenote: _Caesar. comment. lib._ 8.]  of the sundrie courses of the starres, the order of inferiour things,  with manie other matters incident to the morall and politike gouernment  of mans life: and to haue deliuered the same in the Phenician letters:  out of which the Greekes (according to the opinion of Archilochus)  [Sidenote: _In epithet. temp._  _De aequinorus contra Appionem_.]  deuised & deriued the Greeke characters, insomuch that Xenophon and  Iosephus doo constantlie report (although Diogenes Laertius be against  it) that both the Greekes and other nations receiued their letters and  learning first from these countries. Of this king and his learning arose  [Sidenote: _Lib. de Magic. success. lib._ 22.]  a sect of philosophers (saith Annius) first in Britaine, and after in  Gallia, the which of his name were called Samothei. They (as Aristotle  and Secion write) were passing skilfull both in the law of God and man:  [Sidenote: _Script. Brit. cent._ I.]  and for that cause exceedinglie giuen to religion, especiallie the  inhabitants of this Ile of Britaine, insomuch that the whole nation  did not onelie take the name of them, but the Iland it selfe (as Bale  [Sidenote: _De ant. Cant. cent. lib._ I.]  and doctor Caius agree) came to be called Samothea, which was the first  peculiar name that euer it had, and by the which it was especiallie  [Sidenote: This Ile called Samothea.]  knowne before the arriuall of Albion.    [Sidenote: MAGUS THE SON OF SAMOTHES. _Lib._ 9.  _Annius in commen. super eundem. Geogr._]  Magus the sonne of Samothes, after the death of his  father, was the second king of Celtica, by whome (as Berosus writeth)  there were manie townes builded among the Celts, which by the witnesse  of Annius did beare the addition of their founder Magus: of which townes  diuers are to be found in Ptolomie. And Antoninus a painfull surueior of  the world and searcher of cities, maketh mention of foure of them here  in Britaine, Sitomagus, Neomagus, Niomagus, and Nouiomagus. Neomagus  sir Thomas Eliot writeth to haue stood where the citie of Chester now  standeth; Niomagus, George Lillie placeth where the towne of Buckingham  is now remaining. Beside this, Bale dooth so highlie commend the foresaid  Magus for his learning renowmed ouer all the world, that he would haue  the Persians, and other nations of the south and west parts, to deriue  the name of their diuines called _Magi_ from him. In deed Rauisius  Textor, and sir Iohn Prise affirme, that in the daies of Plinie, the  Britons were so expert in art magike, that they might be thought to haue  first deliuered the same to the Persians. What the name of _Magus_  [Sidenote: _De diui. lib._ 1.  _De fastis li._ 5.]  importeth, and of what profession the _Magi_ were, Tullie declareth at  large, and Mantuan in briefe, after this maner:        Ille penes Persas Magus est, qui sidera norit,    Qui sciat herbarum vires cultumq; deorum,    Persepoli facit ista Magos prudentia triplex.      The Persians terme him Magus, that    the course of starres dooth knowe,    The power of herbs, and worship due      to God that man dooth owe,    By threefold knowledge thus the name      of Magus then dooth growe.      [Sidenote: _H.F._]      [Sidenote: SARRON THE SON OF MAGUS.  _De ant. Cant. lib._ 1.]  [Sidenote: _Bale. script_.  _Brit. cent._ I.]  Sarron the third king of the Celts succeeded his father Magus in  gouernement of the countrie of Gallia, and the Ile Samothea, wherein as  (D. Caius writeth) he founded certaine publike places for them that  professed learning, which Berosus affirmeth to be done, to the intent  to restraine the wilfull outrage of men, being as then but raw and void  of all ciuilitie. Also it is thought by Annius, that he was the first  author of those kind of philosophers, which were called Sarronides, of  whom Diodorus Siculus writeth in this sort: \"There are (saith he) among  [Sidenote: _Lib._ 6.]  the Celts certaine diuines and philosophers called Sarronides, whom  aboue all other they haue in great estimation. For it is the manner  among them, not without a philosopher to make anie sacrifice: sith they  are of beleefe, that sacrifices ought onelie to be made by such as are  skilfull in the diuine mysteries, as of those who are neerest vnto God,  by whose intercession they thinke all good things are to be required of  God, and whose aduise they vse and follow, as well in warre as in peace.\"    [Sidenote: DRUIS THE SON OF SARRON.  _De morte Claud._]  Druis, whom Seneca calleth Dryus, being the sonne of Sarron, was after  his father established the fourth king of Celtica, indifferentlie  reigning as wel ouer the Celts as Britons, or rather (as the inhabitants  of this Ile were then called) Samotheans. This prince is commended by  Berosus to be so plentifullie indued with wisedome and learning, that  Annius taketh him to be the vndoubted author of the begining and name of  the philosophers called Druides, whome Caesar and all other ancient  Greeke and Latine writers doo affirme to haue had their begining in  Britaine, and to haue bin brought from thence into Gallia, insomuch that  when there arose any doubt in that countrie touching any point of their  discipline, they did repaire to be resolued therein into Britaine, where,  speciallie in the Ile of Anglesey (as Humfrey Llhoyd witnesseth) they  [Sidenote: _Anti. lib._ 5.  _Annius super eundem_.  _De bello Gallico_. 6.]  made their principall abode. Touching their vsages many things are  written by Aristotle, Socion, Plinie, Laertius, Bodinus, and others:  which I will gather in briefe, and set downe as followeth. They had  (as Caesar saith) the charge of common & priuate sacrifices, the  discussing of points of religion, the bringing vp of youth, the  determining of matters in variance with full power to interdict so manie  from the sacrifice of their gods and the companie of men, as disobeied  [Sidenote: _Hist. an. lib._ 1.]  their award. Polydore affirmeth, how they taught, that mens soules could  not die, but departed from one bodie to another, and that to the intent  [Sidenote: _De diui. lib._ 1.]  to make men valiant and drealesse of death. Tullie writeth, that  partlie by tokens, and partlie by surmises, they would foretell things  to come. And by the report of Hector Boetius, some of them were not  ignorant of the immortalitie of the one and euerlasting God. All these  [Sidenote: _Hist. Scoti. li._ 2.  _De migr. gen. lib._ 2.  _Marcellinus_.]  things they had written in the Greeke toong, insomuch that Wolf. Lazius  (vpon the report of Marcellinus) declareth how the Greeke letters were  first brought to Athens by Timagenes from the Druides. And herevpon it  commeth also to passe, that the British toong hath in it remaining at  this day some smacke of the Greeke. Among other abuses of the Druides,  they had (according to Diodorus) one custome to kill men, and by the  falling, bleeding, and dismembring of them, to diuine of things to come:  for the which and other wicked practises, their sect was first condemned  for abhominable (as some haue written) and dissolued in Gallia (as  Auentinus witnesseth) by Tiberius and Claudius the emperours; and  [Sidenote: _Anna. Boiorum. lib._ 22.]  lastlie abolished here in Britaine (by the report of Caius) when the  gospell of Christ by the preaching of Fugatius and Damianus was receiued  [Sidenote: _De ant.
