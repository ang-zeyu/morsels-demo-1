Preface      We cannot gain experience by being brought into contact with the  experiences of others, nor can we know music by reading about it. Only  by taking it into our hearts and homes, by admitting it to our intimate  companionship, can we approach a knowledge of the art that has enriched  so many lives, even though it has never yet completely fulfilled its  function. At the same time, every music lover is helped to new ideas,  inspired to fresh efforts, by suggestions and statements from those who  have themselves had deep experiences in their search for the inner  sanctuary of the Temple of Art.    Musicians have been too much inclined to treat their art as something to  be exclusively appropriated by a favored class of men and women, and are  themselves greatly to blame for its mistaken isolation. True, music has  its privileged class. To this belongs the mind of creative genius that  can formulate in tones the universal passions, the eternal verities of  the soul. In it may also be numbered those gifted beings whose  interpretative powers peculiarly adapt them to spread abroad the  utterances of genius. Precisely in the same way religion has its  prophets and its ministers. Music, as well as religion, is meant for  everyone, and the business of its ministers and teachers is to convey to  all the message of its prophets.    The nineteenth century was the period of achievement. There is every  reason to believe that the twentieth century will be the period of still  nobler achievement, beyond all in the realm of the spirit. Then will  music find its most splendid opportunity, and in our own free soil it  will yield its richest fruitage. Amid the favorable conditions of  liberty it will flourish to the utmost, and will come to afford blessed  relief from the pressure of materialism. During the era we are entering  no unworthy teacher will be permitted to trifle with the unfolding  musical instincts of childhood. The study of music will take an honored  place in the curriculum of every school, academy, college and  university, as an essential factor in culture. Then music among us will  come to reflect our deepest, truest consciousness, the American  world-view.    It is with a desire to stimulate thought and incite to action that the  present volume has been prepared for every music lover. The essays  contained in it have not previously appeared in print. They are composed  to a large extent of materials used by the author in her lectures and  informal talks on music and its history. That her readers may be led to  seek further acquaintance with the divine art is her earnest wish.    Many thanks are due L. C. Page & Company, of Boston, for kind permission  to use the portrait of Corelli, from their \"Famous Violinists,\" by Henry  C. Lahee.    AUBERTINE WOODWARD MOORE.  MADISON, WIS.          FOR EVERY MUSIC LOVER          I    The Origin and Function of Music      One of the most interesting of the many interesting stories of our  civilization is the story of Music. It affords an intimate knowledge of  the inner life of man as manifested in different epochs of the world's  history. He who has failed to follow it has failed to comprehend the  noblest phenomena of human progress.    Mythology and legendary lore abound in delightful traditions in regard  to the birth of music. The untutored philosophers of primitive humanity  and the learned philosophers of ancient civilizations alike strove to  solve the sweet, elusive mystery surrounding the art. Through the myths  and legends based on their speculations runs a suggestion of divine  origin.    The Egyptians of old saw in their sublime god, Osiris, and his ideal  spouse, Isis, the authors of music. Among the Hindus it was regarded as  a priceless gift from the great god Brahma, who was its creator and  whose peerless consort, Sarasvati, was its guardian. Poetic fancies in  these lines permeate the early literature of diverse peoples.    This is not surprising. Abundant testimony proves that the existence of  music is coeval with that of mankind; that it is based on the  modulations of the human voice and the agitations of the human muscles  and nerves caused by the infinite variations of the spiritual and  emotional sensations, needs and aspirations of humanity; that it has  grown with man's growth, developed with man's development, and that  its origin is as divine as that of man.    [Illustration: MOZART]    The inevitable dualism which Emerson found bisecting all nature appears  also in music, which is both spiritual and material. The spiritual part  of music appeals to the spiritual part of man, addressing each heart  according to the cravings and capacities of each. The material part of  music may be compared to the body in which man's spirit is housed. It is  the vehicle which conveys the message of music from soul to soul through  the medium of the human ear with its matchless harp of nerve-fibres and  its splendid sounding-board, the eardrum.    Music is the mirror which most perfectly reflects man's inner being and  the essence of all things. Ruskin saw clearly that he alone can love art  well who loves better what art mirrors. This may especially be applied  to music, which offers, as a Beethoven has said, a more lofty revelation  than all wisdom and philosophy.    Having no model in nature, being neither an imitation of any actual  object, nor a repetition of anything experienced, music stands alone  among the arts. It represents the real thing, as Schopenhauer has it,  the thing itself, not the mere semblance. Were we able to give a  thoroughly satisfactory explanation of music, he declares, we should  have the true philosophy of the universe.    \"Music is a kind of inarticulate, unfathomable speech, which leads us to  the edge of the Infinite, and impels us for a moment to gaze into it,\"  exclaimed Carlyle. Wagner found in music the conscious language of  feeling, that which ennobles the sensual and realizes the spiritual.  \"Music is the harmonious voice of creation, an echo of the invisible  world, one note of the divine concord which the entire universe is  destined one day to sound,\" wrote Mazzini. Literature is rich in noble  definitions of the divine art.    From a matter of fact standpoint music consists of a vast concourse of  tones which are its raw materials and bear within themselves the  possibility of being moulded into form. Utterances and actions  illustrating these raw materials are common to all living creatures. A  dog, reiterating short barks of joy, or giving vent to prolonged howls  of distress, is actuated by an impulse similar to that of the human  infant as it uplifts its voice to express its small emotions. The sounds  uttered by primeval man as the direct expression of his emotions were  unquestionably of a like nature.    The tendency to manifest feeling by means of sound is universally  admitted, and sound, freighted with feeling, is peculiarly exciting to  human beings. The agitations of a mob may be increased by the emotional  tones of its prime movers, and we all know that the power of an orator  depends more on his skill in handling his voice than on what he says.    A craving for sympathy exists in all animate beings. It is strong in  mankind and becomes peculiarly intense in the type known as artistic.  The fulness of his own emotions compels the musician to utterance. To  strike a sympathetic chord in other sensitive breasts it becomes  necessary to devise forms of expression that may be unmistakably  intelligible.    Out of such elements the tone-language has grown, precisely as the  word-language grew out of men's early attempts to communicate facts to  one another. Its story records a slow, painstaking building up of  principles to control its raw materials; for music, as we understand it,  cannot exist without some kind of design. Vague sounds produce vague,  fleeting impressions. Definiteness in tonal relations and rhythmic plan  is requisite to produce a defined, enduring impression. In primitive  states of music rhythmic sounds were heard, defined by the pulses but  with little or no change of pitch, and sounds varying in pitch without  regularity of impulse. A high degree of intellectuality was reached  before our modern scales were evolved from long-continued attempts at  making well-balanced successions of sounds. As musical art advanced  rhythm and melodic expression became united.    The study of the origin, function and evolution of music, according to  modern scientific methods, is a matter of comparatively recent date. As  late as 1835 a French writer of the history of music expressed profound  regret that he had been unable to determine when music was invented, or  to discover the inventor's name. It was his opinion that musical man had  profited largely from the voices of the feathered tribes. He seriously  asserted that the duck had evidently furnished a model for the clarionet  and oboe, and Sir Chanticleer for the trumpet. An entire chapter of his  book he devoted to surmises concerning the \"Music before the Flood.\" The  poor man felt himself superior to the poetic fancies of the ancients,  which at least foreshadowed the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18285"],[0,"Tales from the Hindu Dramatists (#2)"],[1,"  Indulging in sorrow at his repudiation of Sakuntala, the king passes  three long years; at the end of which Matali, Indra's charioteer,  appears to ask the king's aid in vanquishing the demons. He makes his  aerial voyage in Indra's car. While he is coming back from the realm of  Indra, he alights on the hermitage of Maricha.    Here he sees a young boy tormenting a lion-whelp. Taking his hand,  without knowing him to be his own son, he exclaims:--\"If now the touch  of but a stranger's child thus sends a thrill of joy through all my  limbs, what transports must be awakened in the soul of that blest father  from whose loins he sprang!\"    From the vaunting speeches of the boy, the king gathers that the boy is  a scion of the race of Puru. His heart everflows with affection for him.  A collection of circumstantial evidence points the boy to be his son.  The amulet on the boy indicates his parentage.    But while he is in a doubtful mood as to the parentage of the refractory  boy, he meets the sage Maricha from whom he learns everything. The name  of the boy is Sarvadamana, afterwards known as Bharata, the most famous  king of the Lunar race, whose authority is said to have extended over a  great part of India, and from whom India is to this day called Bharata  or Bharatavarsa (the country or domain of Bharata.)    Soon after, he finds and recognises Sakuntala, with whom he is at length  happily re-united.          VIKRAMORVASI OR URVASI WON BY VALOUR    OR    THE HERO AND THE NYMPH.      In the Himalaya mountains, the nymphs of heaven, on returning from an  assembly of the gods, are mourning over the loss of Urvasi, a  fellow-nymph, who has been carried off by a demon. King Pururavas enters  on his chariot, and on hearing the cause of their grief, hastens to the  rescue of the nymph. He soon returns, after having vanquished the  robber, and restores Urvasi to her heavenly companions. While carrying  the nymph back to her friends in his chariot, he is enraptured by her  beauty, falls in love with her and she with her deliverer. Urvasi being  summoned before the throne of Indra, the lovers are soon obliged to  part. When they part, Urvasi wishes to turn round once more to see the  king.    She pretends that a straggling vine has caught her garland, and while  feigning to disengage herself, she calls one of her friends to help her.    The friend replies:--    \"I fear, this is no easy task. You seem entangled too fast to be set  free: but, come what may, defend upon my friendship.\" The eyes of the  king then meet those of Urvasi. They now part.    The king is now at Prayag, the modern Allahabad, his residence. He walks  in the garden of his palace, accompanied by a Brahman who is his  confidential companion, and knows his love for Urvasi. The companion is  so afraid of betraying what must remain a secret to everybody at court,  and in particular to the queen, that he hides himself in a retired  temple. There a female servant of the queen discovers him, and 'as a  secret can no more rest in his breast than morning dew upon the grass,'  she soon finds out from him why the king is so changed, since his return  from the battle with the demon, and carries the tale to the queen. In  the meantime, the king is in despair, and pours out his grief. Urvasi  also is sighing for him. She suddenly descends with her friend through  the air to meet him.    Both are at first invisible to him, and listen to his confession of  love.    Then Urvasi writes a verse on a birch-leaf, and lets it fall near the  bower where her beloved reclines.    Next, her friend becomes visible, and at last, Urvasi herself is  introduced to the king. After a few moments, however, both Urvasi and  her friend are called back by a messenger of the gods, and the king is  left alone with his jester. He looks for the leaf on which Urvasi had  first disclosed her love, but it is lost, carried away by the wind. But  worse than this the leaf is picked up by the queen, who comes to look  for the king in the garden. The queen severely upbraids her husband,  and, after a while, goes off in a hurry, like a river in the rainy  season.    When Urvasi was recalled to Indra's heaven, she had to act before Indra  the part of the goddess of beauty, who selects Vishnu for her husband.  One of the names of Vishnu is Purushottama.    Poor Urvasi, when called upon to confess on whom her heart was set,  forgetting the part she had to act, says \"I love Pururavas,\" instead of  \"I love Purushottama.\"    Her teacher Bharata, the author of the play, is so much exasperated by  this mistake, that he pronounces a curse upon Urvasi. \"You must lose  your divine knowledge.\" After the close of the performance, Indra,  observing her as she stood apart, ashamed and disconsolate, calls her  and says:--    \"The mortal, who engrosses your thoughts, has been my friend in the days  of adversity; he has helped me in the conflict with the enemies of the  gods, and is entitled to my acknowledgements. You must, accordingly,  repair to him and remain with him till he beholds the offspring you  shall bear him.\" The god thus permits her to marry the mortal hero.    After transacting public business, the king retires to the garden of the  palace as the evening approaches. A messenger arrives from the queen,  apprising his Majesty that she desires to see him on the terrace of the  pavilion. The king obeys and ascends the crystal steps while the moon is  just about to rise, and the east is tinged with red.    As he is waiting for the queen, his desire for Urvasi is awakened again.  On a sudden, Urvasi enters on a heavenly car, accompanied by his friend.  They are invisible to the king as on the previous occasion. The moment  that Urvasi is about to withdraw her veil, the queen appears. She is  dressed in white, without any ornaments, and comes to propitiate her  husband, by taking a vow.    Then she, calling upon the god of the moon, performs her solemn vow and  retires.    Urvasi, who is present, though in an invisible state, during this scene  of matrimonial reconciliation, now advances behind the king and covers  his eyes with her hands. The king says:--    \"It must be Urvasi; no other hand could shed such ecstasy through my  emaciated frame. The solar rays do not wake the night's fair blossom;  that alone expands when conscious of the moon's dear presence.\"    She takes the resignation of the queen in good earnest and claims the  king as granted her by right. Her friend takes leave and she now remains  with the king as his beloved wife in the groves of a forest.    Subsequently the lovers are wandering near Kailasa, the divine mountain,  when Urvasi, in a fit of jealousy, enters the grove of Kumara, the god  of war, which is forbidden to all females. In consequence of Bharat's  curse she is instantly metamorphosed into a creeper. The king beside  himself with grief at her loss, seeks her everywhere. The nymphs in a  chorus deplore her fate. Mournful strains are heard in the air.    The king enters a wild forest, his features express insanity, his dress  is disordered. Clouds gather overhead. He rushes frantically after a  cloud which he mistakes for a demon that carried away his bride.    He addresses various birds and asks them whether they have seen his  love,--the peacock, 'the bird of the dark-blue throat and eyes of  jet,'--the cuckoo, 'whom lovers deem Love's messenger,'--the swans, 'who  are sailing northward, and whose elegant gait betrays that they have  seen her,'--the chakravaka, 'a bird who, during the night, is himself  separated from his mate,'--but none responds. He apostrophises various  insects, beasts and even a mountain peak to tell him where she is.    Neither the bees which murmur amidst the petals of the lotus, nor the  royal elephant, that reclines with his mate under the Kadamba tree, has  seen the lost one.    At last he thinks he sees her in the mountain stream:--    \"The rippling wave is like her frown; the row of tossing birds her  girdle; streaks of foam, her fluttering garment as she speeds along; the  current, her devious and stumbling gait. It is she turned in her wrath  into a stream.\"    At last the king finds a gem of ruddy radiance. He holds it in his  hands, and embraces the vine which is now transformed into Urvasi. Thus  is she restored to her proper form, through the mighty spell of the  magical gem. The efficacious gem is placed on her forehead. The king  recovers his reason. They are thus happily re-united and return to  Allahabad.    Several years elapse. An unlucky incident now comes to pass. A hawk  bears away the ruby of re-union. Orders are sent to shoot the bird, and,  after a short while, a forester brings the jewel and the arrow by which  the hawk was killed. An inscription on the shaft shows that its owner is  Ayus. A female ascetic enters, leading a boy with a bow in hand.    The boy is Ayus, the son of Urvasi, whom his mother confided to the  female ascetic who generously brought him up in the forest and now;  sends him back to his mother. The king who was not aware that Urvasi  had ever borne him a son, now recognises Ayus as his son. Urvasi also  comes to embrace her boy. She now suddenly bursts into tears and tells  the king:--    \"Indra decreed that I am to be recalled to heaven when you see our son.  This induced me to conceal from you so long the birth of the child. Now  that you have accidentally seen the child, I shall have to return to  heaven, in compliance with the decree of Indra.\"    She now prepares to leave her husband after she has seen her boy  installed as associate king. So preparations are made for the  inauguration ceremony when Narada the messenger of Indra, comes to  announce that the god has compassionately revoked the decree. The nymph  is thus permitted to remain on earth for good as the hero's second wife.    Nymphs descend from heaven with a golden vase containing the water of  the heavenly Ganges, a throne, and other"]]]
