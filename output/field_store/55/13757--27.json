A fair was held twice in a twelvemonth  at the market-town of Wisebey, and three times in the seven years old  Diccon Bowman took the lad to see the sights at that place. Beyond these  three glimpses of the outer world he lived almost as secluded a life as  one of the neighboring monks of St. Mary's Priory.    Crosbey-Holt, their new home, was different enough from Falworth or  Easterbridge Castle, the former baronial seats of Lord Falworth. It was  a long, low, straw-thatched farm-house, once, when the church lands were  divided into two holdings, one of the bailiff's houses. All around were  the fruitful farms of the priory, tilled by well-to-do tenant holders,  and rich with fields of waving grain, and meadow-lands where sheep and  cattle grazed in flocks and herds; for in those days the church lands  were under church rule, and were governed by church laws, and there,  when war and famine and waste and sloth blighted the outside world,  harvests flourished and were gathered, and sheep were sheared and cows  were milked in peace and quietness.    The Prior of St. Mary's owed much if not all of the church's prosperity  to the blind Lord Falworth, and now he was paying it back with a haven  of refuge from the ruin that his former patron had brought upon himself  by giving shelter to Sir John Dale.    I fancy that most boys do not love the grinding of school life--the  lessons to be conned, the close application during study hours. It is  not often pleasant to brisk, lively lads to be so cooped up. I wonder  what the boys of to-day would have thought of Myles's training. With him  that training was not only of the mind, but of the body as well, and for  seven years it was almost unremitting. \"Thou hast thine own way to  make in the world, sirrah,\" his father said more than once when the boy  complained of the grinding hardness of his life, and to make one's way  in those days meant a thousand times more than it does now; it meant not  only a heart to feel and a brain to think, but a hand quick and strong  to strike in battle, and a body tough to endure the wounds and blows in  return. And so it was that Myles's body as well as his mind had to be  trained to meet the needs of the dark age in which he lived.    Every morning, winter or summer, rain or shine he tramped away six long  miles to the priory school, and in the evenings his mother taught him  French.    Myles, being prejudiced in the school of thought of his day, rebelled  not a little at that last branch of his studies. \"Why must I learn that  vile tongue?\" said he.    \"Call it not vile,\" said the blind old Lord, grimly; \"belike, when thou  art grown a man, thou'lt have to seek thy fortune in France land, for  England is haply no place for such as be of Falworth blood.\" And in  after-years, true to his father's prediction, the \"vile tongue\" served  him well.    As for his physical training, that pretty well filled up the hours  between his morning studies at the monastery and his evening studies  at home. Then it was that old Diccon Bowman took him in hand, than whom  none could be better fitted to shape his young body to strength and his  hands to skill in arms. The old bowman had served with Lord Falworth's  father under the Black Prince both in France and Spain, and in long  years of war had gained a practical knowledge of arms that few could  surpass. Besides the use of the broadsword, the short sword, the  quarter-staff, and the cudgel, he taught Myles to shoot so skilfully  with the long-bow and the cross-bow that not a lad in the country-side  was his match at the village butts. Attack and defence with the lance,  and throwing the knife and dagger were also part of his training.    Then, in addition to this more regular part of his physical training,  Myles was taught in another branch not so often included in the military  education of the day--the art of wrestling. It happened that a fellow  lived in Crosbey village, by name Ralph-the-Smith, who was the greatest  wrestler in the country-side, and had worn the champion belt for three  years. Every Sunday afternoon, in fair weather, he came to teach Myles  the art, and being wonderfully adept in bodily feats, he soon grew so  quick and active and firm-footed that he could cast any lad under twenty  years of age living within a range of five miles.    \"It is main ungentle armscraft that he learneth,\" said Lord Falworth one  day to Prior Edward. \"Saving only the broadsword, the dagger, and the  lance, there is but little that a gentleman of his strain may use.  Neth'less, he gaineth quickness and suppleness, and if he hath true  blood in his veins he will acquire knightly arts shrewdly quick when the  time cometh to learn them.\"    But hard and grinding as Myles's life was, it was not entirely without  pleasures. There were many boys living in Crosbey-Dale and the village;  yeomen's and farmers' sons, to be sure, but, nevertheless, lads of his  own age, and that, after all, is the main requirement for friendship in  boyhood's world. Then there was the river to bathe in; there were the  hills and valleys to roam over, and the wold and woodland, with their  wealth of nuts and birds'-nests and what not of boyhood's treasures.    Once he gained a triumph that for many a day was very sweet under the  tongue of his memory. As was said before, he had been three times to the  market-town at fair-time, and upon the last of these occasions he had  fought a bout of quarterstaff with a young fellow of twenty, and had  been the conqueror. He was then only a little over fourteen years old.    Old Diccon, who had gone with him to the fair, had met some cronies of  his own, with whom he had sat gossiping in the ale-booth, leaving Myles  for the nonce to shift for himself. By-and-by the old man had noticed  a crowd gathered at one part of the fair-ground, and, snuffing a fight,  had gone running, ale-pot in hand. Then, peering over the shoulders of  the crowd, he had seen his young master, stripped to the waist, fighting  like a gladiator with a fellow a head taller than himself. Diccon was  about to force his way through the crowd and drag them asunder, but a  second look had showed his practised eye that Myles was not only holding  his own, but was in the way of winning the victory. So he had stood with  the others looking on, withholding himself from any interference and  whatever upbraiding might be necessary until the fight had been brought  to a triumphant close. Lord Falworth never heard directly of the  redoubtable affair, but old Diccon was not so silent with the common  folk of Crosbey-Dale, and so no doubt the father had some inkling of  what had happened. It was shortly after this notable event that Myles  was formally initiated into squirehood. His father and mother, as was  the custom, stood sponsors for him. By them, each bearing a lighted  taper, he was escorted to the altar. It was at St. Mary's Priory, and  Prior Edward blessed the sword and girded it to the lad's side. No  one was present but the four, and when the good Prior had given the  benediction and had signed the cross upon his forehead, Myles's mother  stooped and kissed his brow just where the priest's finger had drawn the  holy sign. Her eyes brimmed bright with tears as she did so. Poor  lady! perhaps she only then and for the first time realized how big her  fledgling was growing for his nest. Henceforth Myles had the right to  wear a sword.      Myles had ended his fifteenth year. He was a bonny lad, with brown face,  curling hair, a square, strong chin, and a pair of merry laughing  blue eyes; his shoulders were broad; his chest was thick of girth; his  muscles and thews were as tough as oak.    The day upon which he was sixteen years old, as he came whistling home  from the monastery school he was met by Diccon Bowman.    \"Master Myles,\" said the old man, with a snuffle in his voice--\"Master  Myles, thy father would see thee in his chamber, and bade me send thee  to him as soon as thou didst come home. Oh, Master Myles, I fear me that  belike thou art going to leave home to-morrow day.\"    Myles stopped short. \"To leave home!\" he cried.    \"Aye,\" said old Diccon, \"belike thou goest to some grand castle to  live there, and be a page there and what not, and then, haply, a  gentleman-at-arms in some great lord's pay.\"    \"What coil is this about castles and lords and gentlemen-at-arms?\" said  Myles. \"What talkest thou of, Diccon? Art thou jesting?\"    \"Nay,\" said Diccon, \"I am not jesting. But go to thy father, and then  thou wilt presently know all. Only this I do say, that it is like thou  leavest us to-morrow day.\"    And so it was as Diccon had said; Myles was to leave home the very  next morning. He found his father and mother and Prior Edward together,  waiting for his coming.    \"We three have been talking it over this morning,\" said his father, \"and  so think each one that the time hath come for thee to quit this poor  home of ours. An thou stay here ten years longer, thou'lt be no more fit  to go then than now. To-morrow I will give thee a letter to my kinsman,  the Earl of Mackworth. He has thriven in these days and I have fallen  away, but time was that he and I were true sworn companions, and  plighted together in friendship never to be sundered. Methinks, as I  remember him, he will abide by his plighted troth, and will give thee  his aid to rise in the world. So, as I said, to-morrow morning thou  shalt set forth with Diccon Bowman, and shall go to Castle Devlen, and  there deliver this letter which prayeth him to give thee a place in his  household. Thou mayst have this afternoon to thyself to make read such  things as thou shalt take with thee. And bid me Diccon to take the gray  horse to the village and have it shod.\"    Prior Edward had been standing looking out of the window. As Lord  Falworth ended he turned.    \"And, Myles,\" said he, \"thou wilt need some money, so I will give thee  as a loan"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15575"],[0,"The Tale of Samuel Whiskers; Or, The Roly-Poly Pudding (#2)"],[1,"snuff. When  she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.    \"Anna Maria,\" said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel  Whiskers),--\"Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for  my dinner.\"    \"It requires dough and a pat of butter, and a rolling-pin,\" said Anna  Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    \"No,\" said Samuel Whiskers, \"make it properly, Anna Maria, with  breadcrumbs.\"    [Illustration]    \"Nonsense! Butter and dough,\" replied Anna Maria.    [Illustration]    The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.    Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot, and went boldly down  the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter. He did not meet  anybody.    He made a second journey for the rolling-pin. He pushed it in front of  him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel.    He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were busy lighting the  candle to look into the chest.    They did not see him.    [Illustration]    Anna Maria went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter  to the kitchen to steal the dough.    [Illustration]    She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws.    She did not observe Moppet.    While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he  wriggled about and tried to mew for help.    But his mouth was full of soot and cobwebs, and he was tied up in such  very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.    Except a spider, which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined  the knots critically, from a safe distance.    It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate  blue-bottles. It did not offer to assist him.    Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a  dumpling. First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him  in the dough.    \"Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?\" inquired Samuel  Whiskers.    [Illustration]    Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she  wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the  pastry. She laid hold of his ears.    [Illustration]    Tom Kitten bit and spat, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling-pin  went roly-poly, roly; roly, poly, roly. The rats each held an end.    \"His tail is sticking out! You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria.\"    \"I fetched as much as I could carry,\" replied Anna Maria.    \"I do not think\"--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom  Kitten--\"I do _not_ think it will be a good pudding. It smells sooty.\"    Anna Maria was about to argue the point, when all at once there began to  be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw; and the noise of a  little dog, scratching and yelping!    [Illustration]    The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively.    \"We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our  property--and other people's,--and depart at once.\"    \"I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.\"    [Illustration]    \"But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible,  whatever you may urge to the contrary.\"    \"Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a  counterpane,\" said Anna Maria. \"I have got half a smoked ham hidden in  the chimney.\"    [Illustration]    So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up--there  was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a  very dirty dumpling!    [Illustration]    But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of  the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round  and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet.    [Illustration]    Then he nailed the plank down again and put his tools in his bag, and  came downstairs.    The cat family had quite recovered. They invited him to stay to dinner.    The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten, and made separately into a  bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts.    They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the  butter off.    John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to  stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheel-barrow for  Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops.    And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the  lane from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the  run, with big bundles on a little wheel-barrow, which looked very like  mine.    They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.    Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath. Anna Maria was still  arguing in shrill tones.    She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of  luggage.    I am sure _I_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheel-barrow!    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    They went into the barn, and hauled their parcels with a bit of string  to the top of the hay mow.    [Illustration]    After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha  Twitchit's.    [Illustration]    As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted. There are  rats, and rats, and rats in his barn! They eat up the chicken food, and  steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags.    And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers--children  and grand-children and great great grand-children.    There is no end to them!    Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.    They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of  employment. They charge so much a dozen, and earn their living very  comfortably.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    They hang up the rats' tails in a row on the barn door, to show how many  they have caught--dozens and dozens of them.    [Illustration]    But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face  anything that is bigger than--    [Illustration]    A Mouse."]]]
