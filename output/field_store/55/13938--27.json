A sentence requires parts of speech, and parts  of speech are such because they are used as the organic elements of  a sentence.    The criteria of rank in languages are, first, grade of organization,  _i.e._, the degree to which the grammatic processes and methods are  specialized, and the parts of speech differentiated; second, sematologic  content, that is, the body of thought which the language is competent to  convey.    The grammatic processes may be used for three purposes:    First, for _derivation_, where a new word to express a new idea is made  by combining two or more old words, or by changing the vowel of one  word, or by changing the intonation of one word.    Second, for _modification_, a word may be qualified or defined by the  processes of combination, vocalic mutation or intonation.    It should here be noted that the plane between derivation and  qualification is not absolute.    Third, for _relation_. When words as signs of ideas are used together  to express thought, the relation of the words must be expressed by some  means. In English the relation of words is expressed both by placement  and combination, _i.e._, inflection for agreement.    It should here be noted that paradigmatic inflections are used for two  distinct purposes, qualification and relation. A word is qualified by  inflection when the idea expressed by the inflection pertains to the  idea expressed by the word inflected; thus a noun is qualified by  inflection when its number and gender are expressed. A word is related  by inflection when the office of the word in the sentence is pointed out  thereby; thus, nouns are related by case inflections; verbs are related  by inflections for gender, number, and person. All inflection for  agreement is inflection for relation.    In English, three of the grammatic processes are highly specialized.    _Combination_ is used chiefly for derivation, but to some slight extent  for qualification and relation in the paradigmatic categories. But its  use in this manner as compared with many other languages has almost  disappeared.    _Vocalic mutation_ is used to a very limited extent and only by  accident, and can scarcely be said to belong to the English language.    _Intonation_ is used as a grammatic process only to a limited  extent--simply to assist in forming the interrogative and imperative  modes. Its use here is almost rhetorical; in all other cases it is  purely rhetorical.    _Placement_ is largely used in the language, and is highly specialized,  performing the office of exhibiting the relations of words to each other  in the sentence; _i.e._, it is used chiefly for syntactic relation.    Thus one of the four processes does not belong to the English language;  the others are highly specialized.    The purposes for which the processes are used are _derivation_,  _modification_, and _syntactic relation_.    _Derivation_ is accomplished by combination.    _Modification_ is accomplished by the differentiation of adjectives and  adverbs, as words, phrases, and clauses.    _Syntactic relation_ is accomplished by placement. Syntactic relation  must not be confounded with the relation expressed by prepositions.  Syntactic relation is the relation of the parts of speech to each other  as integral parts of a sentence. Prepositions express relations of  thought of another order. They relate words to each other as words.    Placement relates words to each other as parts of speech.    In the Indian tongues combination is used for all three purposes,  performing the three different functions of derivation, modification,  and relation. Placement, also, is used for relation, and for both lands  of relation, syntactic and prepositional.    With regard, then, to the processes and purposes for which they are  used, we find in the Indian languages a low degree of specialization;  processes are used for diverse purposes, and purposes are accomplished  by diverse processes.      DIFFERENTIATION OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH.    It is next in order to consider to what degree the parts of speech are  differentiated in Indian languages, as compared with English.    Indian nouns are extremely connotive, that is, the name does more than  simply denote the thing to which it belongs; in denoting the object it  also assigns to it some quality or characteristic. Every object has many  qualities and characteristics, and by describing but a part of these  the true office of the noun is but imperfectly performed. A strictly  denotive name expresses no one quality or character, but embraces all  qualities and characters.    In _Ute_ the name for bear is _he seizes_, or _the hugger_. In this  case the verb is used for the noun, and in so doing the Indian names the  bear by predicating one of his characteristics. Thus noun and verb are  undifferentiated. In _Seneca_ the north is _the sun never goes there_,  and this sentence may be used as adjective or noun; in such cases noun,  adjective, verb, and adverb are found as one vocable or word, and the  four parts of speech are undifferentiated. In the _Pavaent_ language a  school-house is called _po-kunt-in-in-yi-kaen_. The first part of the  word, _po-kunt_, signifies _sorcery is practiced_, and is the name  given by the Indians to any writing, from the fact that when they  first learned of writing they supposed it to be a method of practicing  sorcery; _in-in-yi_ is the verb signifying _to count_, and the meaning  of the word has been extended so as to signify _to read_; _kaen_  signifies wigwam, and is derived from the verb _kueri_, _to stay_. Thus  the name of the school-house literally signifies _a staying place where  sorcery is counted_, or where papers are read. The _Pavaent_ in naming a  school-house describes the purpose for which it is used. These examples  illustrate the general characteristics of Indian nouns; they are  excessively connotive; a simply denotive name is rarely found. In  general their name-words predicate some attribute of the object named,  and thus noun, adjective, and predicant are undifferentiated.    In many Indian languages there is no separate word for _eye_, _hand_,  _arm_, or other parts and organs of the body, but the word is found with  an incorporated or attached pronoun signifying _my_ hand, _my_ eye;  _your_ hand, _your_ eye; _his_ hand, _his_ eye, etc., as the case  may be. If the Indian, in naming these parts, refers to his own body,  he says _my_; if he refers to the body of the person to whom he is  speaking, he says _your_, &c. If an Indian should find a detached foot  thrown from the amputating-table of an army field hospital, he would say  something like this: I have found somebody _his foot_. The linguistic  characteristic is widely spread, though not universal.    Thus the Indian has no command of a fully differentiated noun expressive  of _eye_, _hand_, _arm_, or other parts and organs of the body.    In the pronouns we often have the most difficult part of an Indian  language. Pronouns are only to a limited extent independent words.    Among the free pronouns the student must early learn to distinguish  between the personal and the demonstrative. The demonstrative pronouns  are more commonly used. The Indian is more accustomed to say _this_  person or thing, _that_ person or thing, than _he_, _she_, or _it_.  Among the free personal pronouns the student may find an equivalent  of the pronoun _I_, another signifying _I and you_; perhaps another  signifying _I and he_, and one signifying _we, more than two_, including  the speaker and those present; and another including the speaker and  persons absent. He will also find personal pronouns in the second and  third person, perhaps with singular, dual, and plural forms.    To a large extent the pronouns are incorporated in the verbs as  prefixes, infixes, or suffixes. In such cases we will call them article  pronouns. These article pronouns point out with great particularity the  person, number, and gender, both of subject and object, and sometimes  of the indirect object. When the article pronouns are used the personal  pronouns may or may not be used; but it is believed that the personal  pronouns will always be found. Article pronouns may not always be found.  In those languages which are characterized by them they are used alike  when the subject and object nouns are expressed and when they are not.  The student may at first find some difficulty with these article  pronouns. Singular, dual, and plural forms will be found. Sometimes  distinct incorporated particles will be used for subject and object, but  often this will not be the case. If the subject only is expressed, one  particle may be used; if the object only is expressed, another particle;  but if subject and object are expressed an entirely different particle  may stand for both.    But it is in the genders of these article pronouns that the greatest  difficulty may be found. The student must entirely free his mind of  the idea that gender is simply a distinction of sex. In Indian tongues,  genders are usually methods of classification primarily into animate  and inanimate. The animate may be again divided into male and female,  but this is rarely the case. Often by these genders all objects are  classified by characteristics found in their attitudes or supposed  constitution. Thus we may have the animate and inanimate, one or both,  divided into the _standing_, the _sitting_, and the _lying_; or they may  be divided into the _watery_, the _mushy_, the _earthy_, the _stony_,  the _woody_, and the _fleshy_. The gender of these article pronouns  has rarely been worked out in any language. The extent to which these  classifications enter into the article pronouns is not well known. The  subject requires more thorough study.

Verily He is the  Most Manifest, the Almighty.    In the name of the Sovereign Lord, the Lord of Power.    Glorified is He before Whom all the dwellers of earth and heaven bow down  in adoration and unto Whom all men turn in supplication. He is the One Who  holdeth in His grasp the mighty kingdom of all created things and unto Him  shall all return. He is the One Who revealeth whatsoever He willeth and by  His injunction 'Be Thou' all things have come into being.    This is an epistle from the letter '_Th_a'(1) unto Him Who will be made  manifest through the power of Truth--He Who is the All-Glorious, the Best  Beloved--to affirm that all created things as well as myself bear witness  for all time that there is none other God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the  Self-Subsisting; that Thou art God, there is no God besides Thee and that  all men shall be raised up to life through Thee.    Lauded and glorified be Thy name, O Lord, my God!    From all eternity I have indeed recognized Thee and unto all eternity will  ever do so through Thine Own Self and not through any one else besides  Thee. Verily Thou art the Source of all knowledge, the Omniscient. From  everlasting I have besought and unto everlasting will beseech forgiveness  for my limited understanding of Thee, aware as I am that there is no God  but Thee, the All-Glorious, the Almighty.    I beg of Thee, O my Best Beloved, to pardon me and those who earnestly  seek to promote Thy Cause; Thou art indeed the One Who forgiveth the sins  of all mankind. And in this second year of my Revelation--a Revelation  which took place at Thy behest--I bear witness that Thou art the Most  Manifest, the Omnipotent, the Ever-Abiding; that of all things that exist  on earth and in the heavens nothing whatsoever can frustrate Thy purpose  and that Thou art the Knower of all things and the Lord of might and  majesty.    Verily, we have believed in Thee and in Thy signs ere the dawn of Thy  Manifestation, and in Thee are we all well-assured. Verily, we have  believed in Thee and in Thy signs after the fulfilment of Thy  Manifestation, and in Thee do we all believe. Verily, we have believed in  Thee and in Thy signs at the hour of Thy Manifestation and bear witness  that through Thine injunction 'Be Thou' all things have been created.    Every Manifestation is but a revelation of Thine Own Self, with each of  Whom we have truly appeared and we bow down in adoration before Thee. Thou  hast been, O my Best Beloved, and shalt ever be my witness throughout  bygone times and in the days to come. Verily, Thou art the All-Powerful,  the Ever-Faithful, the Omnipotent.    I have testified to Thy oneness through Thine Own Self before the dwellers  of the heavens and the earth, bearing witness that, verily, Thou art the  All-Glorious, the Best Beloved. I have attained the recognition of Thee  through Thine Own Self before the dwellers of the heavens and the earth,  bearing witness that Thou art in truth the Almighty, the All-Praised. I  have glorified Thy Name through Thine Own Self before the dwellers of the  heavens and the earth, bearing witness that Thou art indeed the Lord of  power, He Who is the Most Manifest. I have exalted Thy holiness through  Thine Own Self before the dwellers of the heavens and the earth, bearing  witness that in truth Thou art the Most Sanctified, the Most Holy. I have  praised Thy sanctity through Thine Own Self before the dwellers of the  heavens and the earth, bearing witness that Thou art indeed the  Indescribable, the Inaccessible, the Immeasurably Glorified. I have  extolled Thine overpowering majesty through Thine Own Self before the  dwellers of the heavens and the earth, bearing witness that, verily, Thou  and Thou alone art the Lord of might, the Eternal One, the Ancient of  Days.    Hallowed and glorified art Thou; there is none other God but Thee and in  truth unto Thee do we all return.    As to those who have put the kindred of 'Ali to death, ere long they shall  realize to what depths of perdition they have descended.          A Second Tablet Addressed To 'Him Who Will Be Made Manifest'      May the glances of Him Whom God shall make manifest illumine this letter  at the primary school.(2)    He is the Most Glorious.    He is God, no God is there but Him, the Almighty, the Best Beloved. All  that are in the heavens and on the earth and whatever lieth between them  are His. Verily He is the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.    This is a letter from God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, unto  God, the Almighty, the Best Beloved, to affirm that the Bayan and such as  bear allegiance to it are but a present from me unto Thee and to express  my undoubting faith that there is no God but Thee, that the kingdoms of  Creation and Revelation are Thine, that no one can attain anything save by  Thy power and that He Whom Thou hast raised up is but Thy servant and Thy  Testimony. I, indeed, beg to address Him Whom God shall make manifest, by  Thy leave in these words: 'Shouldst Thou dismiss the entire company of the  followers of the Bayan in the Day of the Latter Resurrection by a mere  sign of Thy finger even while still a suckling babe, Thou wouldst indeed  be praised in Thy indication. And though no doubt is there about it, do  Thou grant a respite of nineteen years as a token of Thy favour so that  those who have embraced this Cause may be graciously rewarded "]]]
