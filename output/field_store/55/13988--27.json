The men representing Hostjobokon and Hostjoboard came in  alternately. Hostjobokon took one of the rings which had been made during  the afternoon, and now lay upon the blanket to the right of the invalid,  and placed it against the soles of the feet of the invalid, who was  sitting with knees drawn up, and then against his knees, palms, breast,  each scapula, and top of his head; then over his mouth. While touching the  different parts of the body the ring was held with both hands, but when  placed to the mouth of the invalid it was taken in the left hand. The ring  was made of a reed, the ends of which were secured by a long string  wrapped over the ring like a slipnoose. When the ring was placed over the  mouth of the invalid the string was pulled and the ring dropped and rolled  out of the lodge, the long tail of white cotton yarn, with eagle plume  attached to the end, extending far behind. Hoslgoboard repeated this  ceremony with a second ring, and so did Hostjobokon and Hostjoboard  alternately, until the twelve rings were disposed of. Three of the rings  were afterward taken to the east, three to the south, three to the west,  and three to the north, and deposited at the base of pinon trees. The  rings were placed over the invalid's mouth to give him strength, cause him  to talk with one tongue, and to have a good mind and heart. The other  portions of the body were touched with them for physical benefit. When the  rings had all been rolled out of the lodge Hasjelti entered, followed by  Hostjoghon. He passed the square (the concentrated winds) four times over  the head of the invalid during his hoots. Hostjoghon then waved his turkey  wands about the head and body of the invalid, and the first day's ceremony  was at an end.            SECOND DAY.          DESCRIPTION OF THE SWEAT HOUSES.      The construction of the first sweat house, or tachi, was begun at dawn.  Four of these houses were built on four consecutive mornings, each one  located about 400 feet distant from the great central medicine lodge,  toward the four cardinal points, and all facing to the east. The first one  built was east of the lodge. A description of the construction of this  particular one will answer for all, but the ceremonies differ in detail.    Four upright poles, forked at the upper ends, were placed at the four  cardinal points within an area designated as the base of the house, the  forked ends resting against each other, a circular excavation some 6 feet  in diameter and 1 foot in depth having first been made. Between the  uprights smaller poles were laid; on the poles pinon boughs, sage and  _Bigelovia Douglasii_ (a kind of sage brush) were placed as a thatch; all  being laid sufficiently compact to prevent the sand placed over the top  from sifting through. The doorway, on the east side of the house, was  about 2-1/2 feet high and 20 inches wide. Highly polished sticks (the same  as those employed in blanket weaving) were used to render the sand  covering of the structure smooth. The sweat houses to the east and west  had the rainbow painted over them. Those to the north and south were  devoid of such decoration, because the song priest seldom completes his  medicine in one ceremonial; and he chose to omit the songs which would be  required if the bow ornamented the north and south sweat houses. Under the  direction of the priest of the sweat house, who received instruction from  the song priest, three young men painted the rainbow, one the head and  body, another the skirt and legs, while the third painted the bow. The  head of this goddess was to the north, the bow extending over the  structure. The colors used were made from ground pigments sprinkled on  with the thumb and forefinger. Whenever a pinch of the dry paint was taken  from the pieces of bark which served as paint cups, the artist breathed  upon the hand before sprinkling the paint. This, however, had no religious  significance, but was merely to clear the finger and thumb of any  superfluous sand. The colors used in decoration were yellow, red, and  white from sandstones, black from charcoal, and a grayish blue, formed of  white sand and charcoal, with a very small quantity of yellow and red  sands. (See Fig. 118.) The decorators were carefully watched by the song  priest.                            [Illustration: Figure 118]                              FIG. 118. Sweat house.      Upon the completion of the rainbow the song priest returned to the  medicine lodge, but soon reappeared bearing a basket of twelve turkey  wands, and these he planted around the base of the sweat house on a line  of meal he had previously sprinkled. There was a fire some 20 feet from  the house, in which stones were heated. These stones were placed in the  sweat house on the south side, and upon them was thrown an armful of white  sage and _Bigelovia Douglasii_. A few pine boughs were laid by the side of  the stones for the invalid to sit upon. The entrance to the sweat house  was then covered with a black and white striped blanket upon which were  placed two large Coconino buckskins one upon the other, and upon them a  double piece of white cotton. The buckskins represented daylight, or the  twilight that comes just at the dawn of day. The invalid for whom this  ceremony was held took off all his clothing except the breech cloth, and  sat on the outside by the entrance of the sweat house amid the din of  rattle and song, the theurgist being the only one who had a rattle. The  invalid propelled himself into the house feet foremost, the covering of  the sweat house having been raised for this purpose. After entering it, he  rid himself of his breechcloth and the coverings were immediately dropped.  The song continued 5 minutes, when all stopped for a moment and then  recommenced.                                  [Illustration]                            RAINBOW OVER SWEAT HOUSE.      During the song the theurgist mixed various herbs in a gourd over which he  poured water. After chanting some twenty minutes he advanced to the  entrance of the house, taking the medicine gourd with him, and, after  pouring some of its contents on the heated stones, took his seat and  joined in the chanting. After another twenty minutes Hasjelti and  Hostjoghon appeared. A Navajo blanket had previously been placed on the  ground at the south side of the entrance. Hasjelti lifted the coverings  from the entrance, and the patient, having first donned his breech cloth,  came out and sat on the blanket. Hasjelti rubbed the invalid with the horn  of a mountain sheep held in the left hand, and in the right hand a piece  of hide, about 10 inches long and 4 wide, from between the eyes of the  sheep. The hide was held flatly against the palm of the hand, and in this  way the god rubbed the breast of the invalid, while he rubbed his back  with the horn, occasionally alternating his hands. Hostjoghon put the  invalid through the same manipulation. The gods then gave him drink four  times from the gourd containing medicine water composed of finely-chopped  herbs and water, they having first taken a draught of the mixture. The  soles of the feet, palms, breast, back, shoulders, and top of the head of  the invalid were touched with medicine water, and the gods suddenly  disappeared. The patient arose and bathed himself with the remainder of  the medicine water and put on his clothing. The coverings of the entrance,  which were gifts to the song priest from the invalid, were gathered  together by the song priest and carried by an attendant to the medicine  lodge. An attendant erased the rainbow by sweeping his hand from the feet  to the head, drawing the sands with him, which were gathered into a  blanket and carried to the north and deposited at the base of a pinon  tree. The song priest placed the wands in a basket, and thus, preceded by  the invalid, carried them in both hands to the medicine lodge singing a  low chant. The sweat house was not carelessly torn down, but was taken  down after a prescribed form. Four men commenced at the sides toward the  cardinal points, and with both hands scraped the sand from the boughs.  When this was all removed the boughs were carefully gathered and conveyed  to a pinon tree some 50 feet distant and fastened horizontally in its  branches about 2 feet above the ground. The heated stones from the  interior of the sweat house were laid on the boughs; the upright logs  which formed the frame work of the house were carried to a pinon tree, a  few feet from the tree in which the boughs and heated stones were placed,  and arranged crosswise in the tree, and on these logs corn meal was  sprinkled and on the meal a medicine tube (cigarette) was deposited. The  tube was about 2 inches long and one third of an inch in diameter, and it  contained a ball composed of down from several varieties of small birds,  sacred tobacco, and corn pollen. It was an offering to Hasjelti. Meal was  sprinkled on the tube. The ground on which the house had stood was  smoothed over, the ashes from the fire carefully swept away, and thus all  traces of the ceremony were removed. The invalid upon entering the lodge  took his seat on the west side facing east. The song priest continued his  chant. He took from the meal bag some sacred meal and placed it to the  soles of the feet of the invalid and on his palms, knees, breast, back,  shoulders, and head. At the conclusion of this ceremony all indulged in a  rest for an hour or more. The bark cups which contained the colored sands  for decorating were placed in the medicine lodge north of the door.          SWEAT HOUSES AND MASKS.

To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,  obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by  and was brewing on a large scale.    The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might keep his  eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,  was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire  was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't  replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so  surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that  it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his  white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which  effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.    \"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried a cheerful voice. It was  the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this  was the first intimation he had of his approach.    \"Bah!\" said Scrooge. \"Humbug!\"    He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this  nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and  handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.    \"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge's nephew. \"You don't mean  that, I am sure?\"    \"I do,\" said Scrooge. \"Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?  What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.\"    \"Come, then,\" returned the nephew gaily. \"What right have you to be  dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.\"    Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,  \"Bah!\" again; and followed it up with \"Humbug!\"    \"Don't be cross, uncle!\" said the nephew.    [Illustration: _\"A Merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\" cried a  cheerful voice._]    \"What else can I be,\" returned the uncle, \"when I live in such a world  of fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's  Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time  for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for  balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen  of months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\" said  Scrooge indignantly, \"every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas'  on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a  stake of holly through his heart. He should!\"    \"Uncle!\" pleaded the nephew.    \"Nephew!\" returned the uncle sternly, \"keep Christmas in your own way,  and let me keep it in mine.\"    \"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge's nephew. \"But you don't keep it.\"    \"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge. \"Much good may it do you!  Much good it has ever done you!\"    \"There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I  have not profited, I dare say,\" returned the nephew; \"Christmas among  the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when it  has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and  origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good  time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know  of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one  consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people  below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and  not another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,  uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I  believe that it _has_ done me good, and _will_ do me good; and I say,  God bless it!\"    The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately  sensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the  last frail spark for ever.    \"Let me hear another sound from _you_,\" said Scrooge, \"and you'll keep  your Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful  speaker, sir,\" he added, turning to his nephew. \"I wonder you don't go  into Parliament.\"    \"Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\"    Scrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the  whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that  extremity first.    \"But why?\" cried Scrooge's nephew. \"Why?\"    \"Why did you get married?\" said Scrooge.    \"Because I fell in love.\"    \"Because you fell in love!\" growled Scrooge, as if that were the only  one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \"Good  afternoon!\"    \"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give  it as a reason for not coming now?\"    \"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.    \"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be  friends?\"    \"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.    \"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never  had any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial  in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.  So A Merry Christmas, uncle!\"    \"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.    \"And A Happy New Year!\"    \"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.    His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He  stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the  clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned  them cordially.    \"There's another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \"my  clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking  about a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.\"    This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people  in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with  their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their  hands, and bowed to him.    \"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,\" said one of the gentlemen, referring  to his list. \"Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.  Marley?\"    \"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\" Scrooge replied. \"He died  seven years ago, this very night.\"    \"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving  partner,\" said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.    It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous  word \"liberality\" Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the  credentials back.    \"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\" said the gentleman,  taking up a pen, \"it is more than usually desirable that we should make  some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at  the present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;  hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\"    \"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge.    \"Plenty of prisons,\" said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.    \"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge. \"Are they still in  operation?\"    \"They are. Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish I could say they were  not.\"    \"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\" said Scrooge.    \"Both very busy, sir.\"    \"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had  occurred to stop them in their useful course,\" said Scrooge. \"I am very  glad to hear it.\"    \"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind  or body to the multitude,\" returned the gentleman, \"a few of us are  endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and  means of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all  others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I  put you down for?\"    \"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied.    \"You wish to be anonymous?\"    \"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge. \"Since you ask me what I wish,  gentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,  and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the  establishments I have mentioned--they cost enough; and those who are  badly off must go there.\"    \"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\"    \"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had better do it, and  decrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.\"    \"But you might know it,\" observed the gentleman.    \"It's not my business,\" Scrooge returned. \"It's enough for a man to  understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.  Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\"    Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the  gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion  of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.    Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with  flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in  carriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,  whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a  Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and  quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its  teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became  intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers  were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,  round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their  hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug  being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned  to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and  berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy  as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:  a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that  such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do.
