Ma cooked de candy in de wash pot out in de yard.  Fust she poured in some home-made sirup, an' put in a heap of brown  sugar from de old sirup barrel an' den she biled it down to whar if you  drapped a little of it in cold water it got hard quick. It wuz ready den  to be poured out in greasy plates an' pans. Us greased our han's wid  lard to keep de candy from stickin' to 'em, an' soon as it got cool  enough de couples would start pullin' candy an' singin'. Dat's mighty  happy music, when you is singin' an' pullin' candy wid yo' bes' feller.  When de candy got too stiff an' hard to pull no mo', us started eatin',  an' it sho' would evermo' git away from dar in a hurry. You ain't nebber  seed no dancin', what is dancin', lessen you has watched a crowd dance  atter dey et de candy what dey done been pullin'.    \"Quiltin's wuz a heap of fun. Sometimes two or three famblies had a  quiltin' together. Folkses would quilt some an' den dey passed 'roun' de  toddy. Some would be cookin' while de others wuz a quiltin' an' den when  supper wuz ready dey all stopped to eat. Dem colla'd greens wid cornpone  an' plenty or gingercakes an' fruit puffs an' big ole pots of coffee wuz  mighty fine eatin's to us den.    \"An' dere warn't nothin' lackin' when us had cornshuckin's. A gen'ral of  de cornshuckin' wuz appointed to lead off in de fun. He sot up on top of  de big pile of corn an' hysted de song. He would git 'em started off  singin' somethin' lak, 'Sallie is a Good Gal,' an' evvybody kept time  shuckin' an' a singin'. De gen'ral kept singin' faster an' faster, an'  shucks wuz jus' flyin'. When pa started passin' de jug 'roun' dem  Niggers sho' nuff begun to sing loud an' fas' an' you wuz 'bliged for to  'low Sallie mus' be a Good Gal, de way de shucks wuz comin' off of dat  corn so fas'. Dey kep' it up 'til de corn wuz all shucked, an' ma  hollered, 'Supper ready!' Den dey made tracks for de kitchen, an' dey  didn't stop eatin' an' drinkin' dat hot coffee long as dey could  swallow. Ain't nobody fed 'em no better backbones, an' spareribs, turnip  greens, 'tato pies, an' sich lak dan my ma set out for 'em. Old time  ways lak dat is done gone for good now. Folkses ain't lak dey used to  be. Dey's all done got greedy an' don't keer 'bout doin' nothin' for  nobody else no more.    \"Ma combed our hair wid a Jim Crow comb, or cyard, as some folkses  called 'em. If our hair wuz bad nappy she put some cotton in de comb to  keep it from pullin' so bad, 'cause it wuz awful hard to comb.    \"Evvybody tried to raise plenty of gourds, 'cause dey wuz so handy to  use for dippers den. Water wuz toted from de spring an' kept in piggins.  Don't spec' you ebber did see a piggin. Dats a wooden bucket wid wire  hoops 'roun' it to keep it from leakin'. De wash place wuz nex' to de  spring. Pa fixed us up a big old stump whar us had to battle de clo'es  wid a battlin' stick. It tuk a sight of battlin' to git de dirt out  sometimes.    \"If you turned a chunk over in de fire, bad luck wuz sho' to come to  you. If a dog howled a certain way at night, or if a scritch owl come in  de night, death wuz on de way to you, an' you always had to be keerful  so maybe bad spirits would leave you alone.    \"Pa built us a new kitchen, jus' lak what de white folkses had dem days.  It sot out in de back yard, a little piece of a way from our house. He  made it out of logs an' put a big old chimbly wid a big fireplace at one  end. Benches wuz built 'roun' de sides for seats. Dere warn't no floor  in it, but jus' dirt floor. Dat wuz one gran' kitchen an' us wuz mighty  proud of it. [HW: p.4]    \"My w'ite folkses begged me not to leave 'em, when I told 'em I wuz  gwine to marry Joe Telfair. I'd done been wukkin' for 'em nigh on to six  years, an' wuz mos' twenty years old. Dey gimme my weddin' clo'es, an'  when I seed dem clo'es I wuz one proud Nigger, 'cause dey wuz jus' lak I  wanted. De nightgown wuz made out of white bleachin' an' had lots of  tucks an' ruffles an' it even had puff sleeves. Sho' 'nough it did! De  petticoat had ruffles an' puffs plum up to de wais' ban'. Dere wuz a  cosset kiver dat wuz cut to fit an' all fancy wid tucks an' trimmin',  an' de drawers, dey sho' wuz pretty, jus' full of ruffles an' tucks  'roun' de legs. My dress wuz a cream buntin', lak what dey calls serge  dese days. It had a pretty lace front what my ma bought from one of de  Moss ladies. When I got all dressed up I wuz one mo' gran' lookin'  bride.    \"Us got married in de new kitchen an' it wuz plum full, 'cause ma had  done axed 76 folkses to de weddin'. Some of 'em wuz Joe's folkses, an'  us had eight waiters: four gals, an' four boys. De same Preacher Brown  what baptized me, married us an' den us had a big supper. My Missus,  Lula Weir, had done baked a great big pretty cake for me an' it tasted  jus' as good as it looked. Atter us et all us could, one of de waiters  called de sets for us to dance de res' of de night. An' sich dancin' as  us did have! Folkses don't know how to dance dat good no mo'. Dat wuz  sho' nuff happy dancin'. Yes Ma'am, I ain't nebber gonna forgit what a  gran' weddin' us had.    \"Next day us moved right here an' I done been here ever since. Dis place  b'longed to Joe's gran'ma, an' she willed it to him. Us had 15 chillun,  but ain't but five of 'em livin' now, an' Joe he's been daid for years.  Us always made a good livin' on de farm, an' still raises mos' of what  us needs, but I done got so po'ly I can't wuk no more.    \"I'se still tryin' to live right an' walk de narrow way, so as I kin go  to Heb'en when I dies. I'se gwine to pray for you an' ax de Lawd to  bless you, for you has been so good an' patient wid me, an' I'se sho'  thankful my son sont you to see me. You done helped me to feel lots  better. Good-bye, an' God bless you, an' please Ma'am, come back to see  me again.\"          PLANTATION LIFE    CORDELIA THOMAS, Age 80  130 Berry Street  Athens, Ga.    Written by:  Grace McCune [HW: (white)]  Athens    Edited by:  Sarah H. Hall  Athens    Leila Harris  Augusta    and  John N. Booth  District Supervisor  Federal Writers' Project  Residencies 6 & 7      A long, hot walk over rough, hilly roads brought the visitor to  Cordelia's place just after the noon hour of a sweltering July day, and  the shade of the tall water oaks near the little cabin was a most  welcome sight. The house stood only a few feet from a spur of railroad  track but the small yard was enclosed by a luxurious green hedge. Roses  predominated among the many varieties of flowers in evidence on the  otherwise drab premises.    A dilapidated porch across the front of the residence had no roof and  the floorboards were so badly rotted that it did not seem quite safe to  walk from the steps to the front door where Cordelia stood waiting.  \"Come right in, Missy,\" she invited, \"but be keerful not to fall through  dat old porch floor.\" The tall, thin Negress was clad in a faded but  scrupulously clean blue dress, a white apron, and a snowy headcloth  crowned by a shabby black hat. Black brogans completed her costume.  Cordelia led the way to the rear of a narrow hall. \"Us will be cooler  back here,\" she explained. Sunlight poured through gaping holes in the  roof, and the coarse brown wrapping paper pasted on the walls was  splattered and streaked by rain. The open door of Cordelia's bedroom  revealed a wooden bed, a marble-topped bureau, and a washstand of the  Victorian period. A rocker, two straight chairs, a small table, and a  trunk completed the furnishings of the room and left but little space  for its occupant to move about.    \"I'se jus' a mite tired,\" Cordelia stated, \"'cause I jus' got back from  de courthouse whar dem welfare 'omans done gimme a sack o' flour and  some other bundles what I ain't opened up yit, but I knows dey's got  somepin in 'em to holp me, 'cause dem folks is sho' been mighty good to  me since my rheumatiz is been so bad I couldn't wuk enough to make a  livin'. De doctor, he say I got de blood presser. I don't rightly know  jus' what dat is, but it looks lak somepin's a-pressin' right down in my  haid 'til I feels right foolish, so I reckon he's right 'bout it a-bein  de blood presser. When I gits down on my knees it takes a long time for  me to git straight up on my feet again. De Lord, He's done been wid me  all dese years, and old Cordelia's goin' to keep right on kneelin' 'fore  Him and praisin' Him often 'til He 'cides de time has come for her to go  home to Heben.    \"I was borned on Marse Andrew Jackson's plantation down in 'Conee  (Oconee) County, twixt here and High Shoals. Marse Andy, he owned my  Mammy, and she was named Em'ly Jackson. Bob Lowe was my Daddy, and he  b'longed to Marse Ike Lowe. The Lowe plantation was nigh whar Marse  Andy's was, down der in 'Conee County. 'Cause neither one of deir  marsters wouldn't sell one of 'em to de other marster, Mammy had to stay  on de Jackson plantation and Daddy was kept right on wukin' on de Lowe  place atter dey had done got married. Marse Bob, he give Daddy a ticket  what let him go to see Mammy evvy Wednesday and Sadday night, and dem  patterollers couldn't bother him long as he kept dat ticket. When dey  did find a slave off his marster's plantation widout no ticket, it was  jus' too bad, for dat meant a beatin' what most kilt him. Mammy said dey  didn't never git my Daddy, 'cause he allus had his ticket to show.    \"I don't ricollect much 'bout days 'fore de big war ended 'cause I was  so little den, but many's de time I heared Mammy and Daddy and de other  old folks tell 'bout dem times. Us chillun had de bestes' time of  anybody dem days, 'cause dey didn't 'low us to do nothin' but jus' eat  all us could and play de rest of de time. I don't know how it was on  other places, but dat was de way us was raised on our old marster's  plantation.    \"De cracks of de log cabins whar de slaves lived was chinked wid red mud  to keep out de cold and rain.
