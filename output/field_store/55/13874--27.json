Here is the story in a few words: One night while the gondolier  was sleeping in his gondola, waiting for custom along the canal of S.  Giorgio Maggiore, three mysterious individuals jumped into his boat and  bade him take them to the Lido; one of the three persons, as well as he  could be distinguished in the darkness, appeared to have the beard of an  apostle and the figure of a high dignitary of the Church; the two  others, by a certain sound as of armour rubbing beneath their mantles,  revealed themselves as men-at-arms. The gondolier turned his prow  towards the Lido and began to row; but the lagoon, so tranquil at their  departure, began to chop and swell strangely: the waves gleamed with  sinster{a} lights; monstrous apparitions were outlined menacingly around  the barque to the great terror of the gondolier; and hideous spirits of  evil and devils half man half fish seemed to be swimming from the Lido  towards Venice, making the waves emit thousands of sparks and exciting  the tempest with whistling and fiendish laughter in the storm; but the  appearance of the shining swords of the two knights and the extended  hand of the saintly personage made them recoil and vanish in sulphurous  explosions.    The battle lasted for a long time; new demons constantly succeeded the  others; however, the victory remained with the personages in the boat,  who had themselves taken back to the landing of the Piazzetta. The  gondolier scarcely knew what to think of their strange conduct; until,  as they were about to separate, the oldest of the group, suddenly  causing his nimbus to shine out again, said to the gondolier: \"I am  Saint Mark, the patron of Venice. I learned to-night that the devils  assembled in convention at the Lido in the cemetery of the Jews, had  formed the resolution of exciting a frightful tempest and overthrowing  my beloved city, under the pretext that many excesses are committed  there which give the evil spirits power over her inhabitants; but as  Venice is a good Catholic and will confess her sins in the beautiful  cathedral which she has raised to me, I resolved to defend her from this  peril of which she was ignorant, by the aid of these two brave  companions, Saint George and Saint Theodore, and I have borrowed thy  boat; now, as all trouble merits reward, and as thou hast passed a  boisterous night, here is my ring; carry it to the Doge and tell him  what thou hast seen. He will fill thy cap with golden sequins.\"    So saying, the Saint resumed his position on the top of the porch of  Saint Mark's, Saint Theodore climbed to the top of his column, where his  crocodile was grumbling with ill-humour, and Saint George went to squat  in the depths of his columned niche in the great window of the Ducal  Palace.    The gondolier, rather astonished, and he had reason enough, would have  believed that he had been dreaming after drinking during that evening  several glasses too many of the wine of Samos, if the large and heavy  golden ring studded with precious stones which he held in his hand had  not prevented his doubting the reality of the events of the night.    Therefore, he went to find the Doge, who was presiding over the Senate  in his cap of office, and, respectfully kneeling before him, he related  the story of the battle between the devils and the patron saints of  Venice. At first this story seemed incredible; but the return of the  ring, which was in very sooth that of Saint Mark, and the absence of  which from the church treasury was established, proved the gondolier's  veracity. This ring, locked up under triple keys in a carefully-guarded  treasury, the bolts of which showed no trace of disturbance, could only  have been removed by supernatural means. They filled the gondolier's cap  with gold and celebrated a mass of thanksgiving for the peril they had  escaped. This did not prevent the Venetians from continuing their  dissolute course of life, from spending their nights in the haunts of  play, at gay suppers, and in love-making; in masking for intrigues, and  in prolonging the long orgy of their carnival for six months in the  year. The Venetians counted upon the protection of Saint Mark to go to  paradise and they took no other care of their salvation. That was Saint  Mark's affair; they had built him a fine church for that, and the Saint  was still under obligations to them.    The moment selected by Paris Bordone is that when the gondolier falls on  his knees before the Doge. The composition of the scene is very  picturesque; you see in perspective a long row of the brown or grey  heads of senators of the most magisterial character. Curious spectators  are on the steps, forming happily-contrasted groups: the beautiful  Venetian costume is displayed here in all its splendour. Here, as in all  the canvases of this school, an important place is given to  architecture. The background is occupied by fine porticos in the style  of Palladio, animated with people coming and going. This picture  possesses the merit, sufficiently rare in the Italian school, which is  almost exclusively occupied with the reproduction of religious or  mythological subjects, of representing a popular legend, a scene of  manners, in a word, a romantic subject such as Delacroix or"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17487"],[0,"Casa Grande Ruin (#2)"],[1,". Inst. of Amer., Amer. ser., iv,      Cambridge, 1892, p. 453 et sec.]    In 1888 Mr. F. H. Cushing presented to the Congres International des  Americanistes[1] some \"Preliminary notes\" on his work as director of the  Hemenway southwestern archeological expedition. Mr. Cushing did not  describe the Casa Grande, but merely alluded to it as a surviving  example of the temple, or principal structure, which occurred in  conjunction with nearly all the settlements studied. As Mr. Cushing's  work was devoted, however, to the investigation of remains analogous to,  if not identical with, the Casa Grande, his report forms a valuable  contribution to the literature of this subject, and although not  everyone can accept the broad inferences and generalizations drawn by  Mr. Cushing--of which he was able, unfortunately, to present only a mere  statement--the report should be consulted by every student of  southwestern archeology.        [Footnote 1: Berlin meeting, 1888; Compte-Rendu, Berlin, 1890,      p. 150 et seq.]    The latest contribution to the literature of the Casa Grande is a report  by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes,[1] also of the Hemenway expedition, under the  title \"On the present condition of a ruin in Arizona called Casa  Grande.\" Two magnificent illustrations are presented, engravings from  photographs, showing general views of the ruin, as well as a number of  views depicting details, and the ground plan presented at the end of the  report is the best so far published. It is unfortunate that this author  was not able to give more time to the study of the ruin; yet his report  is a valuable contribution to our knowledge concerning the Casa Grande.        [Footnote 1: Jour. of Amer. Ethn. and Arch., Cambridge, 1892, vol.      ii, page 179 et seq.]          DESCRIPTION.      THE CASA GRANDE GROUP.    The Casa Grande has been variously placed at from 2 leagues to 2 miles  south of Gila river. The writer has never traversed the distance from  the ruin to the river, but the ruin is about a mile from Walker ranch,  which is well known in that neighborhood, and about half a mile from the  river. This question, however, is not of much importance, as the ruin is  easily found by anyone looking for it, being located directly on one of  the stage routes from Casa Grande station, on the Southern Pacific  railroad, to Florence, Arizona, and about 9 miles below, or west of, the  latter place.    The name Casa Grande has been usually applied to a single structure  standing near the southwestern corner of a large area covered by mounds  and other debris, but some writers have applied it to the southwestern  portion of the area and even to the whole area. The latter seems the  proper application of the term, but to avoid confusion, where both the  settlement as a whole and that portion which has formed the theme of so  many writers are referred to, the settlement will be designated as the  Casa Grande group, and the single structure with standing walls as the  Casa Grande ruin.    Probably no two investigators would assign the same limits to the area  covered by the group, as the margins of this area merge imperceptibly  into the surrounding country. The accompanying map (plate LI) shows this  area as interpreted by the writer. The surface covered by well defined  remains, as there shown, extends about 1,800 feet north and south and  1,500 feet east and west, or a total area of about 65 acres.    [Illustration: Pl. LI: Map of Casa Grande Group.]    The Casa Grande ruin, as the term is here used, occupies a position near  the southwestern corner of the group, and it will be noticed that its  size is insignificant as compared with that of the entire group, or even  with the large structure in the north-central part of it. The division  of the group into northern and southern portions, which has been made by  some writers, is clearly shown on the map; but this division is more  apparent than real. The contour interval on the map is one foot--a  sufficiently small interval to show the surface configuration closely  and to bring out some of its peculiarities. Depressions are shown by  dotted contours. It will be noticed that while most of the mounds which  mark the sites of former structures rise but 10 feet or less above the  surrounding level, the profiles vary considerably, some being much more  smoothed off and rounded than others, the former being shown on the map  by even, \"flowing\" contours, while the latter are more irregular; and it  will be further noticed that the irregularity reaches its maximum in the  vicinity of the Casa Grande ruin proper, where the ground surface was  more recently formed, from the fall of walls that were standing within  the historical period.    External appearance is a very unsafe criterion of age, although in some  cases, like the present, it affords a fair basis for hypothesis as to  comparative age; but even in this case, where the various portions of  the group have presumably been affected alike by climatic and other  influences, such hypothesis, while perhaps interesting, must be used  with the greatest caution. Within a few miles of this place the writer  has seen the remains of a modern adobe house whose maximum age could not  exceed a decade or two, yet which presented an appearance of antiquity  quite as great as that of the wall remains east and southeast of the  Casa Grande ruin.    The application of the hypothesis to the map brings out some interesting  results. In the first place, it may be seen that in the lowest mounds,  such as those in the northwestern corner of the sheet, on the southern  margin, and southwest of the well-marked mound on the eastern margin,  the contours are more flowing and the slopes more gentle than in others.  This suggests that these smoothed mounds are older than the others, and,  further, that their present height is not so great as their former  height; and again, under this hypothesis, it suggests that the remains  do not belong to one period, but that the interval which elapsed between  the abandonment of the structures whose sites are marked by the low  mounds and the most recent abandonment was long. In other words, this  group, under the hypothesis, affords another illustration of a fact  constantly impressed on the student of southwestern village remains,  that each village site marks but an epoch in the history of the tribe  occupying it--a period during which there was constant, incessant  change, new bands or minor divisions of the tribe appearing on the  scene, other divisions leaving the parent village for other sites, and  the ebb and flow continuing until at some period in its history the  population of a village sometimes became so reduced that the remainder,  as a matter of precaution, or for some trifling reason, abandoned it en  masse. This phase of pueblo life, more prominent in the olden days than  at present, but still extant, has not received the prominence it  deserves in the study of southwestern remains. Its effects can be seen  in almost every ruin; not all the villages of a group, nor even all the  parts of a village, were inhabited at the same time, and estimates of  population based on the number of ruins within a given region, and even  those based on the size of a given ruin, must be materially revised. As  this subject has been elsewhere[1] discussed, it can be dismissed here  with the statement that the Casa Grande group seems to have formed no  exception to the general rule, but that its population changed from time  to time, and that the extent of the remains is no criterion of the  former population.        [Footnote 1: See pp. 179-261 of this Report, \"Aboriginal Remains in      Verde Valley.\"]    It will be noticed that in some of the mounds, noticeably those in the  immediate vicinity of the Casa Grande ruin, the surface is very  irregular. In this instance the irregularity indicates a recent  formation of surface; for at this point many walls now marked only by  mounds were standing within the historical period. External contour is  of course a product of erosion, yet similarity of contour does not  necessarily indicate either equal erosion or equal antiquity. Surface  erosion does not become a prominent factor until after the walls have  fallen, and one wall may easily last for a century or two centuries  longer than another similarly situated. The surface erosion of a  standing wall of grout, such as these under discussion, is very slight;  photographs of the Casa Grande ruin, extending over a period of sixteen  years, and made from practically the same point of view, show that the  skyline or silhouette remained essentially unchanged during that period,  every little knob and projection remaining the same. It is through  sapping or undermining at the ground surface that walls are destroyed.  An inspection of the illustrations accompanying this paper will show  what is meant by sapping: the external walls are cut away at the ground  surface to a depth varying from a few inches to nearly 2 feet. After a  rain the ground, and that portion of the walls at present below its  surface, retains moisture much longer than the part of the walls which  stands clear; the moisture rises by capillary attraction a foot or two  above the ground surface, rendering the walls at this level softer than  elsewhere, and as this portion is more exposed to the flying sand which  the wind sweeps over the ground it is here that erosion attains its  maximum. The wall is gradually cut away at and just above the ground  surface until finally the base becomes too small to support it and it  falls en masse. Then and not till then surface erosion becomes an  important factor and the profile of the mass becomes finally rounded.  But it will be readily seen that a slight difference of texture, or  thickness, or exposure, or some trifling difference too minute for  observation, might easily add many decades to the apparent age of a  mound.
