And Humphrey Goode, our attorney, who's executor of the estate, will  welcome you with open arms, once he finds out what you want to do. That  collection has him talking to himself, already. Look; if you come out  to our happy home in the early afternoon, before Fred and Anton get back  from the plant, we ought to ram through some sort of agreement with  Geraldine and Nelda.\"    \"You and whoever else sides with me will be a majority,\" Rand considered.  \"Of course, the other one may pull a Gromyko on us, but ... I think I'll  talk to Goode, first.\"    \"Yes. That would be smart,\" Gladys Fleming agreed. \"After all, he's  responsible for selling the collection.\" She crossed to the desk and sat  down in Rand's chair while she wrote out the check and a short letter of  authorization, then she returned to her own seat.    \"There's another thing,\" she continued, lighting a fresh cigarette.  \"Because of the manner of Mr. Fleming's death, the girls have a horror of  the collection almost--but not quite--as strong as their desire to get  the best possible price for it.\"    \"Yes. I'd heard that Mr. Fleming had been killed in a firearms accident,  last November,\" Rand mentioned.    \"It was with one of his collection-pieces,\" the widow replied. \"One  he'd bought just that day; a Confederate-made Colt-type percussion .36  revolver. He'd brought it home with him, simply delighted with it, and  started cleaning it at once. He could hardly wait until dinner was over  to get back to work on it.    \"We'd finished dinner about seven, or a little after. At about half-past,  Nelda went out somewhere in the coupe. Anton had gone up to his  laboratory, in the attic--he's one of these fortunates whose work is also  his hobby; he's a biochemist and dietitian--and Lane was in the gunroom,  on the second floor, working on his new revolver. Fred Dunmore was having  a bath, and Geraldine and I had taken our coffee into the east parlor.  Geraldine put on the radio, and we were listening to it.    \"It must have been about 7:47 or 7:48, because the program had changed  and the first commercial was just over, when we heard a loud noise from  somewhere upstairs. Neither of us thought of a shot; my own first idea  was of a door slamming. Then, about five minutes later, we heard Anton,  in the upstairs hall, pounding on a door, and shouting: 'Lane! Lane! Are  you all right?' We ran up the front stairway, and found Anton, in his  rubber lab-apron, and Fred, in a bathrobe, and barefooted, standing  outside the gunroom door. The door was locked, and that in itself was  unusual; there's a Yale lock on it, but nobody ever used it.    \"For a minute or so, we just stood there. Anton was explaining that he  had heard a shot and that nobody in the gunroom answered. Geraldine told  him, rather impatiently, to go down to the library and up the spiral. You  see,\" she explained, \"the library is directly under the gunroom, and  there's a spiral stairway connecting the two rooms. So Anton went  downstairs and we stood waiting in the hall. Fred was shivering in his  bathrobe; he said he'd just jumped out of the bathtub, and he had  nothing on under it. After a while, Anton opened the gunroom door from  the inside, and stood in the doorway, blocking it. He said: 'You'd better  not come in. There's been an accident, but it's too late to do anything.  Lane's shot himself with one of those damned pistols; I always knew  something like this would happen.'    \"Well, I simply elbowed him out of the way and went in, and the others  followed me. By this time, the uproar had penetrated to the rear of the  house, and the servants--Walters, the butler, and Mrs. Horder, the  cook--had joined us. We found Lane inside, lying on the floor, shot  through the forehead. Of course, he was dead. He'd been sitting on one of  these old cobblers' benches of the sort that used to be all the thing for  cocktail-tables; he had his tools and polish and oil and rags on it. He'd  fallen off it to one side and was lying beside it. He had a revolver in  his right hand, and an oily rag in his left.\"    \"Was it the revolver he'd brought home with him?\" Rand asked.    \"I don't know,\" she replied. \"He showed me this Confederate revolver when  he came home, but it was dirty and dusty, and I didn't touch it. And I  didn't look closely at the one he had in his hand when he was ... on the  floor. It was about the same size and design; that's all I could swear  to.\" She continued: \"We had something of an argument about what to do.  Walters, the butler, offered to call the police. He's English, and his  mind seems to run naturally to due process of law. Fred and Anton both  howled that proposal down; they wanted no part of the police. At the  same time, Geraldine was going into hysterics, and I was trying to get  her quieted down. I took her to her room and gave her a couple of  sleeping-pills, and then went back to the gunroom. While I was gone, it  seems that Anton had called our family doctor, Dr. Yardman, and then Fred  called Humphrey Goode, our lawyer. Goode lives next door to us, about two  hundred yards away, so he arrived almost at once. When the doctor came,  he called the coroner, and when he arrived, about an hour later, they all  went into a huddle and decided that it was an obvious accident and that  no inquest would be necessary. Then somebody, I'm not sure who, called an  undertaker. It was past eleven when he arrived, and for once, Nelda got  home early. She was just coming in while they were carrying Lane out in a  basket. You can imagine how horrible that was for her; it was days before  she was over the shock. So she'll be just as glad as anybody to see the  last of the pistol-collection.\"    Through the recital, Rand had sat silently, toying with the ivory-handled  Italian Fascist dagger-of-honor that was doing duty as a letter-opener on  his desk. Gladys Fleming wasn't, he was sure, indulging in any  masochistic self-harrowing; neither, he thought, was she talking to  relieve her mind. Once or twice there had been a small catch in her  voice, but otherwise the narration had been a piece of straight  reporting, neither callous nor emotional. Good reporting, too; carefully  detailed. There had been one or two inclusions of inferential matter in  the guise of description, but that was to be looked for and discounted.  And she had remembered, at the end, to include her ostensible reason for  telling the story.    \"Yes, it must have been dreadful,\" he sympathized. \"Odd, though, that an  old hand with guns like Mr. Fleming would have an accident like that. I  met him, once or twice, and was at your home to see his collection, a  couple of years ago. He impressed me as knowing firearms pretty  thoroughly.... Well, you can look for me tomorrow, say around two. In  the meantime, I'll see Goode, and also Gresham and Arnold Rivers.\"          CHAPTER 2      After ushering his client out the hall door and closing it behind her,  Rand turned and said:    \"All right, Kathie, or Dave; whoever's out there. Come on in.\"    Then he went to his desk and reached under it, snapping off a switch.  As he straightened, the door from the reception-office opened and  his secretary, Kathie O'Grady, entered, loading a cigarette into an  eight-inch amber holder. She was a handsome woman, built on the generous  lines of a Renaissance goddess; none of the Renaissance masters, however,  had ever employed a model so strikingly Hibernian. She had blue eyes, and  a fair, highly-colored complexion; she wore green, which went well with  her flaming red hair, and a good deal of gold costume-jewelry.    Behind her came Dave Ritter. He was Rand's assistant, and also Kathie's  lover. He was five or six years older than his employer, and slightly  built. His hair, fighting a stubborn rearguard action against baldness,  was an indeterminate mousy gray-brown. It was one of his professional  assets that nobody ever noticed him, not even in a crowd of one; when he  wanted it to, his thin face could assume the weary, baffled expression of  a middle-aged book-keeper with a wife and four children on fifty dollars  a week. Actually, he drew three times that much, had no wife, admitted to  no children. During the war, he and Kathie had kept the Tri-State Agency  in something better than a state of suspended animation while Rand had  been in the Army.    Ritter fumbled a Camel out of his shirt pocket and made a beeline for the  desk, appropriating Rand's lighter and sharing the flame with Kathie.    \"You know, Jeff,\" he said, \"one of the reasons why this agency never made  any money while you were away was that I never had the unadulterated  insolence to ask the kind of fees you do. I was listening in on the  extension in the file-room; I could hear Kathie damn near faint when  you said five grand.\"    \"Yes; five thousand dollars for appraising a collection they've been  offered ten for, and she only has a third-interest,\" Kathie said,  retracting herself into the chair lately vacated by Gladys Fleming.  \"If that makes sense, now ...\"    \"Ah, don't you get it, Kathleen Mavourneen?\" Ritter asked. \"She doesn't  care about the pistols; she wants Jeff to find out who fixed up that  accident for Fleming. You heard that big, long shaggy-dog story about  exactly what happened and where everybody was supposed to have been at  the time. I hope you got all that recorded; it was all told for a  purpose.\"    Rand had picked up the outside phone and was dialing. In a moment, a  girl's voice answered.    \"Carter Tipton's law-office; good afternoon.\"    \"Hello, Rheba; is Tip available?\"    \"Oh, hello, Jeff. Just a sec; I'll see.\" She buzzed another phone. \"Jeff  Rand on the line,\" she announced.    A clear, slightly Harvard-accented male voice took over.    \"Hello, Jeff. Now what sort of malfeasance have you committed?\"    \"Nothing, so far--cross my fingers,\" Rand replied. \"I just want a little"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17897"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part I-II (Pars Prima Secundae) (#2)"],[1,"is not a cause. But  that for which a man acts, is the cause of his action; since this  preposition \"for\" indicates a relation of causality. Therefore it  does not belong to man to act for an end.    Obj. 2: Further, that which is itself the last end is not for an end.  But in some cases the last end is an action, as the Philosopher  states (Ethic. i, 1). Therefore man does not do everything for an end.    Obj. 3: Further, then does a man seem to act for an end, when he acts  deliberately. But man does many things without deliberation,  sometimes not even thinking of what he is doing; for instance when  one moves one's foot or hand, or scratches one's beard, while intent  on something else. Therefore man does not do everything for an end.    _On the contrary,_ All things contained in a genus are derived from  the principle of that genus. Now the end is the principle in human  operations, as the Philosopher states (Phys. ii, 9). Therefore it  belongs to man to do everything for an end.    _I answer that,_ Of actions done by man those alone are properly  called \"human,\" which are proper to man as man. Now man differs from  irrational animals in this, that he is master of his actions.  Wherefore those actions alone are properly called human, of which man  is master. Now man is master of his actions through his reason and  will; whence, too, the free-will is defined as \"the faculty and will  of reason.\" Therefore those actions are properly called human which  proceed from a deliberate will. And if any other actions are found in  man, they can be called actions \"of a man,\" but not properly \"human\"  actions, since they are not proper to man as man. Now it is clear  that whatever actions proceed from a power, are caused by that power  in accordance with the nature of its object. But the object of the  will is the end and the good. Therefore all human actions must be for  an end.    Reply Obj. 1: Although the end be last in the order of execution, yet  it is first in the order of the agent's intention. And it is this way  that it is a cause.    Reply Obj. 2: If any human action be the last end, it must be  voluntary, else it would not be human, as stated above. Now an action  is voluntary in one of two ways: first, because it is commanded by  the will, e.g. to walk, or to speak; secondly, because it is elicited  by the will, for instance the very act of willing. Now it is  impossible for the very act elicited by the will to be the last end.  For the object of the will is the end, just as the object of sight is  color: wherefore just as the first visible cannot be the act of  seeing, because every act of seeing is directed to a visible object;  so the first appetible, i.e. the end, cannot be the very act of  willing. Consequently it follows that if a human action be the last  end, it must be an action commanded by the will: so that there, some  action of man, at least the act of willing, is for the end. Therefore  whatever a man does, it is true to say that man acts for an end, even  when he does that action in which the last end consists.    Reply Obj. 3: Such like actions are not properly human actions; since  they do not proceed from deliberation of the reason, which is the  proper principle of human actions. Therefore they have indeed an  imaginary end, but not one that is fixed by reason.  ________________________    SECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 1, Art. 2]    Whether It Is Proper to the Rational Nature to Act for an End?    Objection 1: It would seem that it is proper to the rational nature  to act for an end. For man, to whom it belongs to act for an end,  never acts for an unknown end. On the other hand, there are many  things that have no knowledge of an end; either because they are  altogether without knowledge, as insensible creatures: or because  they do not apprehend the idea of an end as such, as irrational  animals. Therefore it seems proper to the rational nature to act for  an end.    Obj. 2: Further, to act for an end is to order one's action to an  end. But this is the work of reason. Therefore it does not belong to  things that lack reason.    Obj. 3: Further, the good and the end is the object of the will. But  \"the will is in the reason\" (De Anima iii, 9). Therefore to act for  an end belongs to none but a rational nature.    _On the contrary,_ The Philosopher proves (Phys. ii, 5) that \"not  only mind but also nature acts for an end.\"    _I answer that,_ Every agent, of necessity, acts for an end. For if,  in a number of causes ordained to one another, the first be removed,  the others must, of necessity, be removed also. Now the first of all  causes is the final cause. The reason of which is that matter does  not receive form, save in so far as it is moved by an agent; for  nothing reduces itself from potentiality to act. But an agent does  not move except out of intention for an end. For if the agent were  not determinate to some particular effect, it would not do one thing  rather than another: consequently in order that it produce a  determinate effect, it must, of necessity, be determined to some  certain one, which has the nature of an end. And just as this  determination is effected, in the rational nature, by the \"rational  appetite,\" which is called the will; so, in other things, it is  caused by their natural inclination, which is called the \"natural  appetite.\"    Nevertheless it must be observed that a thing tends to an end, by its  action or movement, in two ways: first, as a thing, moving itself to  the end, as man; secondly, as a thing moved by another to the end, as  an arrow tends to a determinate end through being moved by the archer  who directs his action to the end. Therefore those things that are  possessed of reason, move themselves to an end; because they have  dominion over their actions through their free-will, which is the  \"faculty of will and reason.\" But those things that lack reason tend  to an end, by natural inclination, as being moved by another and not  by themselves; since they do not know the nature of an end as such,  and consequently cannot ordain anything to an end, but can be  ordained to an end only by another. For the entire irrational nature  is in comparison to God as an instrument to the principal agent, as  stated above (I, Q. 22, A. 2, ad 4; Q. 103, A. 1, ad 3). Consequently  it is proper to the rational nature to tend to an end, as directing  (_agens_) and leading itself to the end: whereas it is proper to the  irrational nature to tend to an end, as directed or led by another,  whether it apprehend the end, as do irrational animals, or do not  apprehend it, as is the case of those things which are altogether  void of knowledge.    Reply Obj. 1: When a man of himself acts for an end, he knows the  end: but when he is directed or led by another, for instance, when  he acts at another's command, or when he is moved under another's  compulsion, it is not necessary that he should know the end. And it  is thus with irrational creatures.    Reply Obj. 2: To ordain towards an end belongs to that which directs  itself to an end: whereas to be ordained to an end belongs to that  which is directed by another to an end. And this can belong to an  irrational nature, but owing to some one possessed of reason.  Reply Obj. 3: The object of the will is the end and the good in  universal. Consequently there can be no will in those things that  lack reason and intellect, since they cannot apprehend the universal;  but they have a natural appetite or a sensitive appetite, determinate  to some particular good. Now it is clear that particular causes are  moved by a universal cause: thus the governor of a city, who intends  the common good, moves, by his command, all the particular  departments of the city. Consequently all things that lack reason  are, of necessity, moved to their particular ends by some rational  will which extends to the universal good, namely by the Divine will.  ________________________    THIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 1, Art. 3]    Whether Human Acts Are Specified by Their End?    Objection 1: It would seem that human acts are not specified by their  end. For the end is an extrinsic cause. But everything is specified  by an intrinsic principle. Therefore human acts are not specified by  their end.    Obj. 2: Further, that which gives a thing its species should exist  before it. But the end comes into existence afterwards. Therefore a  human act does not derive its species from the end.    Obj. 3: Further, one thing cannot be in more than one species. But  one and the same act may happen to be ordained to various ends.  Therefore the end does not give the species to human acts.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Mor. Eccl. et Manich. ii, 13):  \"According as their end is worthy of blame or praise so are our deeds  worthy of blame or praise.\"    _I answer that,_ Each thing receives its species in respect of an act  and not in respect of potentiality; wherefore things composed of  matter and form are established in their respective species by their  own forms. And this is also to be observed in proper movements. For  since movements are, in a way, divided into action and passion, each  of these receives its species from an act; action indeed from the act  which is the principle of acting, and passion from the act which is  the terminus of the movement. Wherefore heating, as an action, is  nothing else than a certain movement proceeding from heat, while  heating as a passion is nothing else than a movement towards heat:  and it is the definition that shows the specific nature. And either  way, human acts, whether they be considered as actions, or as  passions, receive their species from the end. For human acts can be  considered in both ways, since man moves himself, and is moved by  himself. Now it has been stated above (A. 1) that acts are called  human, inasmuch as they proceed from a deliberate will. Now the  object of the will is the good and the"]]]
