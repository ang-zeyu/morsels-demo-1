He was not taking any particular risk of losing the  opportunity of an unusually pleasant journey, for the dollar he had  invested in the goodwill of the porter had yielded the information that  the lady was going through to Great Falls. Since Andy had boarded the  train at Harlem there was plenty of time to kill between there and Dry  Lake, which was his destination.    The lady smiled at him rememberingly when finally he seated himself  across the aisle from her, and without any serious motive Andy smiled  back. So presently they were exchanging remarks about the journey. Later  on, Andy went over and sat beside her and conversation began in earnest.  Her name, it transpired, was Florence Grace Hallman. Andy read it  engraved upon a card which added the information that she was engaged  in the real estate business--or so the three or four words implied.  \"Homemakers' Syndicate, Minneapolis and St. Paul,\" said the card. Andy  was visibly impressed thereby. He looked at her with swift appraisement  and decided that she was \"all to the good.\"    Florence Grace Hallman was tall and daintily muscular as to figure. Her  hair was a light yellow--not quite the shade which peroxide gives,  and therefore probably natural. Her eyes were brown, a shade too close  together but cool and calm and calculating in their gaze, and her  eyebrows slanted upward a bit at the outer ends and were as heavy as  beauty permitted. Her lips were very red, and her chin was very firm.  She looked the successful business woman to her fingertips, and she was  eminently attractive for a woman of that self-assured type.    Andy was attractive also, in a purely Western way. His gray eyes were  deceivingly candid and his voice was pleasant with a little, humorous  drawl that matched well the quirk of his lips when he talked. He was  headed for home--which was the Flying U--sober and sunny and with enough  money to see him through. He told Florence Hallman his name, and said  that he lived \"up the road a ways\" without being too definite. Florence  Hallman lived in Minneapolis, she said; though she traveled most of the  time, in the interests of her firm.    Yes, she liked the real estate business. One had a chance to see the  world, and keep in touch with people and things. She liked the West  especially well. Since her firm had taken up the homeseekers' line she  spent most of her time in the West.    They had supper--she called it dinner, Andy observed--together, and Andy  Green paid the check, which was not so small. It was after that, when  they became more confidential, that Florence Hallman, with the egotism  of the successful person who believes herself or himself to be of keen  interest to the listener spoke in greater detail of her present mission.    Her firm's policy was, she said, to locate a large tract of government  land somewhere, and then organize a homeseekers' colony, and settle  the land-hungry upon the tract--at so much per hunger. She thought it  a great scheme for both sides of the transaction. The men who wanted  claims got them. The firm got the fee for showing them the land--and  certain other perquisites at which she merely hinted.    She thought that Andy himself would be a success at the business. She  was quick to form her opinions of people whom she met, and she knew that  Andy was just the man for such work. Andy, listening with his candid,  gray eyes straying often to her face and dwelling there, modestly failed  to agree with her. He did not know the first thing about the real estate  business, he confessed, nor very much about ranching. Oh, yes--he lived  in this country, and he knew THAT pretty well, but--    \"The point is right here,\" said Florence Grace Hallman, laying her pink  fingertips upon his arm and glancing behind her to make sure that they  were practically alone--their immediate neighbors being still in the  diner. \"I'm speaking merely upon impulse--which isn't a wise thing to  do, ordinarily. But--well, your eyes vouch for you, Mr. Green, and we  women are bound to act impulsively sometimes--or we wouldn't be women,  would we?\" She laughed--rather, she gave a little, infectious giggle,  and took away her fingers, to the regret of Andy who liked the feel of  them on his forearm.    \"The point is here. I've recognized the fact, all along, that we need  a man stationed right here, living in the country, who will meet  prospective homesteaders and talk farming; keep up their enthusiasm;  whip the doubters into line; talk climate and soil and the future of the  country; look the part, you understand.\"    \"So I look like a rube, do I?\" Andy's lips quirked a half smile at her.    \"No, of course you don't!\" She laid her fingers on his sleeve again,  which was what Andy wanted--what he had intended to bait her into doing;  thereby proving that, in some respects at least, he amply justified Hiss  Hallman in her snap judgment of him.    \"Of course you don't look like a rube! I don't want you to. But you  do look Western--because you are Western to the bone Besides, you look  perfectly dependable. Nobody could look into your eyes and even think  of doubting the truth of any statement you made to them.\" Andy snickered  mentally at that though his eyes never lost their clear candor. \"And,\"  she concluded, \"being a bona fide resident of the country, your word  would carry more weight than mine if I were to talk myself black in the  face!\"    \"That's where you're dead wrong,\" Andy hastened to correct her.    \"Well, you must let me have my own opinion, Mr. Green. You would be  convincing enough, at any rate. You see, there is a certain per cent  of--let us call it waste effort--in this colonization business. We  have to reckon on a certain number of nibblers who won't bite\"--Andy's  honest, gray eyes widened a hair's breadth at the frankness of her  language--\"when they get out here. They swallow the folders we send  out, but when they get out here and see the country, they can't see it  as a rich farming district, and they won't invest. They go back home and  knock, if they do anything.    \"My idea is to stop that waste; to land every homeseeker that boards our  excursion trains. And I believe the way to do that is to have the right  kind of a man out here, steer the doubtfuls against him--and let his  personality and his experience do the rest. They're hungry enough to  come, you see; the thing is to keep them here. A man that lives right  here, that has all the earmarks of the West, and is not known to be  affiliated with our Syndicate (you could have rigs to hire, and drive  the doubtfuls to the tract)--don't you see what an enormous advantage  he'd have? The class I speak of are the suspicious ones--those who are  from Missouri. They're inclined to want salt with what we say about the  resources of the country. Even our chemical analysis of the soil, and  weather bureau dope, don't go very far with those hicks. They want to  talk with someone who has tried it, you see.\"    \"I--see,\" said Andy thoughtfully, and his eyes narrowed a trifle. \"On  the square, Miss Hallman, what are the natural advantages out here--for  farming? What line of talk do you give those come-ons?\"    Miss Hallman laughed and made a very pretty gesture with her two ringed  hands. \"Whatever sounds the best to them,\" she said. \"If they write and  ask about spuds we come back with illustrated folders of potato crops  and statistics of average yields and prices and all that. If it's dairy,  we have dairy folders. And so on. It isn't any fraud--there ARE  sections of the country that produce almost anything, from alfalfa to  strawberries. You know that,\" she challenged.    \"Sure. But I didn't know there was much tillable land left lying around  loose,\" he ventured to say.    Again Miss Hallman made the pretty gesture, which might mean much or  nothing. \"There's plenty of land 'lying around loose,' as you call it.  How do you know it won't produce, till it has been tried?\"    \"That's right,\" Andy assented uneasily. \"If there's water to put on  it--\"    \"And since there is the land, our business lies in getting people  located on it. The towns and the railroads are back of us. That is, they  look with favor upon bringing settlers into the country. It increases  the business of the country--the traffic, the freights, the merchants'  business, everything.\"    Andy puckered his eyebrows and looked out of the window upon a great  stretch of open, rolling prairie, clothed sparely in grass that was  showing faint green in the hollows, and with no water for miles--as  he knew well--except for the rivers that hurried through narrow bottom  lands guarded by high bluffs that were for the most part barren. The  land was there, all right. But--    \"What I can't see,\" he observed after a minute during which Miss  Florence Hallman studied his averted face, \"what I can't see is, where  do the settlers get off at?\"    \"At Easy street, if they're lucky enough,\" she told him lightly. \"My  business is to locate them on the land. Getting a living off it is  THEIR business. And,\" she added defensively, \"people do make a living on  ranches out here.\"    \"That's right,\" he agreed again--he was finding it very pleasant to  agree with Florence Grace Hallman. \"Mostly off stock, though.\"    \"Yes, and we encourage our clients to bring out all the young stock they  possibly can; young cows and horses and--all that sort of thing. There's  quantities of open country around here, that even the most optimistic  of homeseekers would never think of filing on. They can make out, all  right, I guess. We certainly urge them strongly to bring stock with  them. It's always been famous as a cattle country--that's one of our  highest cards. We tell them--\"    \"How do you do that? Do you go right to them and TALK to them?\"    \"Yes, if they show a strong enough interest--and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17404"],[0,"Kinship Organisations and Group Marriage in Australia (#2)"],[1,"\"     =40=      TABLE.

Associations in the lower stages of culture.       Consanguinity and Kinship. The Tribe. Kinship groups; totem kins;       phratries.      The passage from what is commonly termed savagery through barbarism to  civilisation is marked by a change in the character of the associations  which are almost everywhere a feature of human society. In the lower  stages of culture, save among peoples whose organisation has perished  under the pressure of foreign invasion or other external influences, man  is found grouped into totem kins, intermarrying classes and similar  organised bodies, and one of their most important characteristics is  that membership of them depends on birth, not on the choice of the  individual. In modern society, on the other hand, associations of this  sort have entirely disappeared and man is grouped in voluntary  societies, membership of which depends on his own choice.    It is true that the family, which exists in the lower stages of culture,  though it is overshadowed by the other social phenomena, has persisted  through all the manifold revolutions of society; especially in the stage  of barbarism, its importance in some directions, such as the regulation  of marriage, often forbidden within limits of consanguinity much wider  than among ourselves, approaches the influence of the forms of natal  association which it had supplanted. In the present day, however, if we  set aside its economic and steadily diminishing ethical sides, it  cannot be compared in importance with the territorial groupings on which  state and municipal activities depend.    If the family is a persistent type the tribe may also be compared to the  modern state; it is, in most parts of the world, no less territorial in  its nature; membership of it does not depend among the Australians on  any supposed descent from a common ancestor; and though residence plus  possession of a common speech is mentioned by Howitt as the test of  tribe, it is possible in Australia, under certain conditions[1], to pass  from one tribe to another in such a way that we seem reduced to  residence as the test of membership. This change of tribe takes place  almost exclusively where tribes are friendly, so far as is known; and we  may doubt whether it would be possible for a stranger to settle, without  any rite of adoption, in the midst of a hostile or even of an unknown  tribe; but this is clearly a matter of minor importance, if adoption is  not, as in North America, an invariable element of the change of tribe.  Although membership of a tribe is thus loosely determined, tribesmen  feel themselves bound by ties of some kind to their fellow-tribesmen, as  we shall see below, but in this they do not differ from the members of  any modern state.    But in Australia the importance of the tribe, save from an economic  point of view, as joint owner of the tribal land, is small compared with  the part played in the lives of its members by the intratribal  associations, whose influence is recognised without, as within the  tribe. These associations are of two kinds in the lowest strata of human  society; in each case membership is determined by birth and they may  therefore be distinguished as _natal associations_. In the one case, the  _kinship groups_ such as totem kins, phratries, etc., an individual  remains permanently in the association into which he is born, special  cases apart, in which by adoption he passes out of it and joins another  by means of a legal fiction[2]. The other kind of association, to which  the name _age-grades_ is applied, is composed of a series of grades,  through which, concomitantly with the performance of the rites of  initiation obligatory on every male member of the community, each man  passes in succession, until he attains the highest. In the rare cases  where an individual fails to qualify for the grade into which his  coevals pass, and remains in the grade of \"youth\" or even lower grades,  he is by birth a member of one class and does not remain outside the  age-grades altogether.    In the element of voluntary action lies the distinction between  age-grades and _secret societies_, which are organised "]]]
