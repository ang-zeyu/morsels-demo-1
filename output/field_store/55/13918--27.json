[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],[0,"The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#2)"],[1,"invokes One Supreme  Being who \"cannot be figured in stone.\"    So far as we have any real evidence, however, the Hebrew people  surpassed all others in both the custom and the spirit of devout song.  We get snatches of their inspired lyrics in the song of Moses and  Miriam, the song of Deborah and Barak, and the song of Hannah (sometimes  called \"the Old Testament Magnificat\"), in the hymns of David and  Solomon and all the Temple Psalms, and later where the New Testament  gives us the \"Gloria\" of the Christmas angels, the thanksgiving of  Elizabeth (benedictus minor), Mary's Magnificat, the song of Zacharias  (benedictus major), the \"nunc dimittis\" of Simeon, and the celestial  ascriptions and hallelujahs heard by St. John in his Patmos dream. For  what we know of the first _formulated_ human prayer and praise we are  mostly indebted to the Hebrew race. They seem to have been at least the  only ancient nation that had a complete psalter--and their collection is  the mother hymn-book of the world.    Probably the first form of hymn-worship was the plain-song--a  declamatory unison of assembled singers, every voice on the same pitch,  and within the compass of five notes--and so continued, from whatever  may have stood for plain-song in Tabernacle and Temple days down to the  earliest centuries of the Christian church. It was mere melodic  progression and volume of tone, and there were no instruments--after the  captivity. Possibly it was the memory of the harps hung silent by the  rivers of Babylon that banished the timbrel from the sacred march and  the ancient lyre from the post-exilic synagogues. Only the Feast trumpet  was left. But the Jews sang. Jesus and his disciples sang. Paul and  Silas sang; and so did the post-apostolic Christians; but until towards  the close of the 16th century there were no instruments allowed in  religious worship.    St. Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers has been called \"the father of Christian  hymnology.\" About the middle of the 4th century he regulated the  ecclesiastical song-service, wrote chant music (to Scripture words or  his own) and prescribed its place and use in his choirs. He died A.D.  368. In the Church calendars, Jan. 13th (following \"Twelfth Night\"), is  still kept as \"St. Hilary's Day\" in the Church of England, and Jan. 14th  in the Church of Rome.    St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, a few years later, improved the work of  his predecessor, adding words and music of his own. The \"Ambrosian  Chant\" was the antiphonal plain-song arranged and systematized to  statelier effect in choral symphony. Ambrose died A.D. 397.    Toward the end of the 6th century Christian music showed a decline in  consequence of impatient meddling with the slow canonical psalmody, and  \"reformers\" had impaired its solemnity by introducing fanciful  embellishments. Gregory the Great (Pope of Rome, 590-604) banished these  from the song service, founded a school of sacred melody, composed new  chants and established the distinctive character of ecclesiastical hymn  worship. The Gregorian chant--on the diatonic eight sounds and seven  syllables of equal length--continued, with its majestic choral step, to  be the basis of cathedral music for a thousand years. In the meantime  (930) Hucbald, the Flanders monk, invented _sight_ music, or written  notes--happily called the art of \"hearing with the eyes and seeing with  the ears\"; and Guido Arentino (1024) contrived the present scale, or the  \"hexachord\" on which the present scale was perfected.    In this long interval, however, the \"established\" system of hymn service  did not escape the intrusion of inevitable novelties that crept in with  the change of popular taste. Unrhythmical singing could not always hold  its own; and when polyphonic music came into public favor, secular airs  gradually found their way into the choirs. Legatos, with their pleasing  turn and glide, caught the ear of the multitude. Tripping allegrettos  sounded sweeter to the vulgar sense than the old largos of Pope Gregory  the Great.    The guardians of the ancient order took alarm. One can imagine the  pained amazement of conservative souls today on hearing \"Ring the Bells  of Heaven\" substituted in church for \"Mear\" or the long-metre Doxology,  and can understand the extreme distaste of the ecclesiastical  reactionaries for the worldly frivolities of an A.D. 1550 choir.  Presumably that modern abomination, the _vibrato_, with its shake of  artificial fright, had not been invented then, and sanctuary form was  saved one indignity. But the innovations became an abuse so general that  the Council of Trent commissioned a select board of cardinals and  musicians to arrest the degeneration of church song-worship.    One of the experts consulted in this movement was an eminent Italian  composer born twenty miles from Rome. His full name was Giovanni Pietro  Aloysio da Palestrina, and at that time he was in the prime of his  powers. He was master of polyphonic music as well as plain-song, and he  proposed applying it to grace the older mode, preserving the solemn  beauty of the chant but adding the charming chords of counterpoint. He  wrote three \"masses,\" one of them being his famous \"Requiem.\" These were  sung under his direction before the Commission. Their magnificence and  purity revealed to the censors the possibilities of contrapuntal music  in sanctuary devotion and praise. The sanction of the cardinals was  given--and part-song harmony became permanently one of the angel voices  of the Christian church.    Palestrina died in 1594, but hymn-tunes adapted from his motets and  masses are sung today. He was the father of the choral tune. He lived to  see musical instruments and congregational singing introduced[1] in  public worship, and to know (possibly with secret pleasure, though he  was a Romanist) how richly in popular assemblies, during the Protestant  Reformation, the new freedom of his helpful art had multiplied the  creation of spiritual hymns.    [Footnote 1: But not fully established in use till about 1625.]    Contemporary in England with Palestrina in Italy was Thomas Tallis who  developed the Anglican school of church music, which differed less from  the Italian (or Catholic) psalmody than that of the Continental  churches, where the revolt of the Reformation extended to the  tune-worship as notably as to the sacraments and sermons. This  difference created a division of method and practice even in England,  and extreme Protestants who repudiated everything artistic or ornate  formed the Puritan or Genevan School. Their style is represented among  our hymn-tunes by \"Old Hundred,\" while the representative of the  Anglican is \"Tallis' Evening Hymn.\" The division was only temporary. The  two schools were gradually reconciled, and together made the model after  which the best sacred tunes are built. It is Tallis who is called \"The  father of English Cathedral music.\"    In Germany, after the invention of harmony, church music was still felt  to be too formal for a working force, and there was a reaction against  the motets and masses of Palestrina as being too stately and difficult.  Lighter airs of the popular sort, such as were sung between the acts of  the \"mystery plays,\" were subsidized by Luther, who wrote compositions  and translations to their measure. Part-song was simplified, and Johan  Walther compiled a hymnal of religious songs in the vernacular for from  four to six voices. The reign of rhythmic hymn music soon extended  through Europe.    Necessarily--except in ultra-conservative localities like Scotland--the  exclusive use of the Psalms (metrical or unmetrical) gave way to  religious lyrics inspired by occasion. Clement Marot and Theodore Beza  wrote hymns to the music of various composers, and Caesar Malan composed  both hymns and their melodies. By the beginning of the 18th century the  triumph of the hymn-tune and the hymnal for lay voices was established  for all time.           *       *       *       *       *    In the following pages no pretence is made of selecting _all_ the best  and most-used hymns, but the purpose has been to notice as many as  possible of the standard pieces--and a few others which seem to add or  re-shape a useful thought or introduce a new strain.    To present each hymn _with its tune_ appeared the natural and most  satisfactory way, as in most cases it is impossible to dissociate the  two. The melody is the psychological coefficient of the metrical text.  Without it the verse of a seraph would be smothered praise. Like a  flower and its fragrance, hymn and tune are one creature, and stand for  a whole value and a full effect. With this normal combination a  _complete_ descriptive list of the hymns and tunes would be a historic  dictionary. Such a book may one day be made, but the present volume is  an attempt to the same end within easier limits.          CHAPTER I.    HYMNS OF PRAISE AND WORSHIP.      \"TE DEUM LAUDAMUS.\"    This famous church confession in song was composed A.D. 387 by Ambrose,  Bishop of Milan, probably both words and music.        Te Deum laudamus, Te Dominum confitemur      Te aeternum Patrem omnis terra veneratur      Tibi omnes angeli, tibi coeli et universae potestates,      Tibi cherubim et seraphim inaccessibili voce proclamant      Sanctus, sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth.    In the whole hymn there are thirty lines. The saying that the early  Roman hymns were echoes of Christian Greece, as the Greek hymns were  echoes of Jerusalem, is probably true, but they were only echoes. In  A.D. 252, St. Cyprian, writing his consolatory epistle[2] during the  plague in Carthage, when hundreds were dying every day, says, \"Ah,  perfect and perpetual bliss! [in heaven.] There is the glorious company  of the apostles; there is the fellowship of the prophets rejoicing;  there is the innumerable multitude of martyrs crowned.\" Which would  suggest that lines or fragments of what afterwards crystalized"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],[0,"Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#2)"],[1," this epoch, can cite Jean Jacques Rousseau and  d'Alembert, the foundling of the porch of Notre Dame, and amongst the  obscure, Malfilatre and Gilbert, two overrated reputations, for the  inspiration of the one was but a faint reflection of the weak lyricism  of Jean Baptiste Rousseau, and the inspiration of the other but the  blending of proud impotence with a hatred which had not even the excuse  of initiative and sincerity, since it was only the paid instrument of  party rancour.    We close with this epoch this brief summary of Bohemia in different  ages, a prolegomena besprinkled with illustrious names that we have  purposely placed at the beginning of this work, to put the reader on his  guard against any misapplication he might fall into on encountering the  title of Bohemians; long bestowed upon classes from which those whose  manners and language we have striven to depict hold it an honor to  differ.    Today, as of old, every man who enters on an artistic career, without  any other means of livelihood than his art itself, will be forced to  walk in the paths of Bohemia. The greater number of our contemporaries  who display the noblest blazonry of art have been Bohemians, and amidst  their calm and prosperous glory they often recall, perhaps with regret,  the time when, climbing the verdant slope of youth, they had no other  fortune in the sunshine of their twenty years than courage, which is the  virtue of the young, and hope, which is the wealth of the poor.    For the uneasy reader, for the timorous citizen, for all those for whom  an \"i\" can never be too plainly dotted in definition, we repeat as an  axiom: \"Bohemia is a stage in artistic life; it is the preface to the  Academy, the Hotel Dieu, or the Morgue.\"    We will add that Bohemia only exists and is only possible in Paris.    We will begin with unknown Bohemians, the largest class. It is made up  of the great family of poor artists, fatally condemned to the law of  incognito, because they cannot or do not know how to obtain a scrap of  publicity, to attest their existence in art, and by showing what they  are already prove what they may some day become. They are the race of  obstinate dreamers for whom art has remained a faith and not a  profession; enthusiastic folk of strong convictions, whom the sight of a  masterpiece is enough to throw into a fever, and whose loyal heart beats  high in presence of all that is beautiful, without asking the name of  the master and the school. This Bohemian is recruited from amongst those  young fellows of whom it is said that they give great hopes, and from  amongst those who realize the hopes given, but who, from carelessness,  timidity, or ignorance of practical life, imagine that everything is  done that can be when the work is completed, and wait for public  admiration and fortune to break in on them by escalade and burglary.  They live, so to say, on the outskirts of life, in isolation and  inertia. Petrified in art, they accept to the very letter the symbolism  of the academical dithyrambic, which places an aureola about the heads  of poets, and, persuaded that they are gleaming in their obscurity, wait  for others to come and seek them out. We used to know a small school  composed of men of this type, so strange, that one finds it hard to  believe in their existence; they styled themselves the disciples of art  for art's sake. According to these simpletons, art for art's sake  consisted of deifying one another, in abstaining from helping chance,  who did not even know their address, and in waiting for pedestals to  come of their own accord and place themselves under them.    It is, as one sees, the ridiculousness of stoicism. Well, then we again  affirm, there exist in the heart of unknown Bohemia, similar beings  whose poverty excites a sympathetic pity which common sense obliges you  to go back on, for if you quietly remark to them that we live in the  nineteenth century, that the five-franc piece is the empress of  humanity, and that boots do not drop already blacked from heaven, they  turn their backs on you and call you a tradesman.    For the rest, they are logical in their mad heroism, they utter neither  cries nor complainings, and passively undergo the obscure and rigorous  fate they make for themselves. They die for the most part, decimated by  that disease to which science does not dare give its real name, want. If  they would, however, many could escape from this fatal _denouement_  which suddenly terminates their life at an age when ordinary life is  only beginning. It would suffice for that for them to make a few  concessions to the stern laws of necessity; for them to know how to  duplicate their being, to have within themselves two natures, the poet  ever dreaming on the lofty summits where the choir of inspired voices  are warbling, and the man, worker-out of his life, able to knead his  daily bread, but this duality which almost always exists among strongly  tempered natures, of whom it is one of the distinctive characteristics,  is not met with amongst the greater number of these young fellows, whom  pride, a bastard pride, has rendered invulnerable to all the advice of  reason. Thus they die young, leaving sometimes behind them a work which  the world admires later on and which it would no doubt have applauded  sooner if it had not remained invisible.    In artistic struggles it is almost the same as in war, the whole of the  glory acquired falls to the leaders; the army shares as its reward the  few lines in a dispatch. As to the soldiers struck down in battle, they  are buried where they fall, and one epitaph serves for twenty thousand  dead.    So, too, the crowd, which always has its eyes fixed on the rising sun,  never lowers its glance towards that underground world where the obscure  workers are struggling; their existence finishes unknown and without  sometimes even having had the consolation of smiling at an accomplished  task, they depart from this life, enwrapped in a shroud of indifference.    There exists in ignored Bohemia another fraction; it is composed of  young fellows who have been deceived, or have deceived themselves. They  mistake a fancy for a vocation, and impelled by a homicidal fatality,  they die, some the victims of a perpetual fit of pride, others  worshippers of a chimera.    The paths of art, so choked and so dangerous, are, despite encumberment  and obstacles, day by day more crowded, and consequently Bohemians were  never more numerous.    If one sought out all the causes that have led to this influx, one might  perhaps come across the following.    Many young fellows have taken the declamations made on the subject of  unfortunate poets and artists quite seriously. The names of Gilbert,  Malfilatre, Chatterton, and Moreau have been too often, too imprudently,  and, above all, too uselessly uttered. The tomb of these unfortunates  has been converted into a pulpit, from whence has been preached the  martyrdom of art and poetry,        \"Farewell mankind, ye stony-hearted host,       Flint-bosomed earth and sun with frozen ray,       From out amidst you, solitary ghost       I glide unseen away.\"    This despairing song of Victor Escousse, stifled by the pride which had  been implanted in him by a factitious triumph, was for a time the  \"Marseillaise\" of the volunteers of art who were bent on inscribing  their names on the martyrology of mediocrity.    For these funereal apotheoses, these encomiastic requiems, having all  the attraction of the abyss for weak minds and ambitious vanities, many  of these yielding to this attraction have thought that fatality was the  half of genius; many have dreamt of the hospital bed on which Gilbert  died, hoping that they would become poets, as he did a quarter of an  hour before dying, and believing that it was an obligatory stage in  order to arrive at glory.    Too much blame cannot be attached to these immortal falsehoods, these  deadly paradoxes, which turn aside from the path in which they might  have succeeded so many people who come to a wretched ending in a career  in which they incommode those to whom a true vocation only gives the  right of entering on it.    It is these dangerous preachings, this useless posthumous exaltations,  that have created the ridiculous race of the unappreciated, the whining  poets whose muse has always red eyes and ill-combed locks, and all the  mediocrities of impotence who, doomed to non-publication, call the muse  a harsh stepmother, and art an executioner.    All truly powerful minds have their word to say, and, indeed, utter it  sooner or later. Genius or talent are not unforeseen accidents in  humanity; they have a cause of existence, and for that reason cannot  always remain in obscurity, for, if the crowd does not come to seek  them, they know how to reach it. Genius is the sun, everyone sees it.  Talent is the diamond that may for a long time remain hidden in  obscurity, but which is always perceived by some one. It is, therefore,  wrong to be moved to pity over the lamentations and stock phrases of  that class of intruders and inutilities entered upon an artistic career  in which idleness, debauchery, and parasitism form the foundations of  manners.    Axiom, \"Unknown Bohemianism is not a path, it is a blind alley.\"    Indeed, this life is something that does not lead to anything. It is a  stultified wretchedness, amidst which intelligence dies out like a lamp  in a place without air, in which the heart grows petrified in a fierce  misanthropy, and in which the best natures become the worst. If one has  the misfortune to remain too long and to advance too far in this blind  alley one can no longer get out, or one emerges by dangerous breaches  and only to fall into an adjacent Bohemia, the manners of which belong  to another jurisdiction than that of literary physiology.    We will also cite a singular variety of Bohemians who might be called  amateurs. They are"]]]
