Furthermore, just as the solar cycle has its four seasons, the cycle of  the Sun of Reality has its distinct and successive periods. Each brings  its vernal season or springtime. When the Sun of Reality returns to  quicken the world of mankind a divine bounty descends from the heaven of  generosity. The realm of thoughts and ideals is set in motion and blessed  with new life. Minds are developed, hopes brighten, aspirations become  spiritual, the virtues of the human world appear with freshened power of  growth and the image and likeness of God become visible in man. It is the  springtime of the inner world. After the spring, summer comes with its  fullness and fruitage spiritual; autumn follows with its withering winds  which chill the soul; the Sun seems to be going away until at last the  mantle of winter overspreads and only faint traces of the effulgence of  that divine Sun remain. Just as the surface of the material world becomes  dark and dreary, the soil dormant, the trees naked and bare and no beauty  or freshness remain to cheer the darkness and desolation, so the winter of  the spiritual cycle witnesses the death and disappearance of divine growth  and extinction of the light and love of God. But again the cycle begins  and a new springtime appears. In it the former springtime has returned,  the world is resuscitated, illumined and attains spirituality; religion is  renewed and reorganized, hearts are turned to God, the summons of God is  heard and life is again bestowed upon man. For a long time the religious  world had been weakened and materialism had advanced; the spiritual forces  of life were waning, moralities were becoming degraded, composure and  peace had vanished from souls and satanic qualities were dominating  hearts; strife and hatred overshadowed humanity, bloodshed and violence  prevailed. God was neglected; the Sun of Reality seemed to have gone  completely; deprivation of the bounties of heaven was a fact; and so the  season of winter fell upon mankind. But in the generosity of God a new  springtime dawned, the lights of God shone forth, the effulgent Sun of  Reality returned and became manifest, the realm of thoughts and kingdom of  hearts became exhilarated, a new spirit of life breathed into the body of  the world and continuous advancement became apparent.    I hope that the lights of the Sun of Reality will illumine the whole world  so that no strife and warfare, no battles and bloodshed remain. May  fanaticism and religious bigotry be unknown, all humanity enter the bond  of brotherhood, souls consort in perfect agreement, the nations of earth  at last hoist the banner of truth and the religions of the world enter the  divine temple of oneness, for the foundations of the heavenly religions  are one reality. Reality is not divisible; it does not admit multiplicity.  All the holy Manifestations of God have proclaimed and promulgated the  same reality. They have summoned mankind to reality itself and reality is  one. The clouds and mists of imitations have obscured the Sun of Truth. We  must forsake these imitations, dispel these clouds and mists and free the  Sun from the darkness of superstition. Then will the Sun of Truth shine  most gloriously; then all the inhabitants of the world will be united, the  religions will be one, sects and denominations will reconcile, all  nationalities will flow together in the recognition of one fatherhood and  all degrees of humankind gather in the shelter of the same tabernacle,  under the same banner.    Until the heavenly civilization is founded, no result will be forthcoming  from material civilization, even as you observe. See what catastrophes  overwhelm mankind. Consider the wars which disturb the world. Consider the  enmity and hatred. The existence of these wars and conditions indicates  and proves that the heavenly civilization has not yet been established. If  the civilization of the Kingdom be spread to all the nations, this dust of  disagreement will be dispelled, these clouds will pass away and the Sun of  Reality in its greatest effulgence and glory will shine upon mankind.            THE DAWN OF PEACE      The fatherhood of God, His loving-kindness and beneficence are apparent to  all. In His mercy he provides fully and amply for His creatures and if any  soul sins He does not suspend His bounty. All created things are visible  manifestations of His fatherhood, mercy and heavenly bestowals. Human  brotherhood is likewise as clear and evident as the sun, for all are  servants of one God, belong to one humankind, inhabit the same globe, are  sheltered beneath the overshadowing dome of heaven and submerged in the  sea of divine mercy. Human brotherhood and dependence exist because mutual  helpfulness and cooperation are the two necessary principles underlying  human welfare. This is the physical relationship of mankind. There is  another brotherhood, the spiritual, which is higher, holier and superior  to all others. It is heavenly; it emanates from the breaths of the Holy  Spirit and the effulgence of merciful attributes; it is founded upon  spiritual susceptibilities. This brotherhood is established by the  Manifestations of the Holy One.    The divine Manifestations since the day of Adam have striven to unite  humanity so that all may be accounted as one soul. The function and  purpose of a shepherd is to gather and not disperse his flock. The  prophets of God have been divine shepherds of humanity. They have  established a bond of love and unity among mankind, made scattered peoples  one nation and wandering tribes a mighty kingdom. They have laid the  foundation of the oneness of God and summoned all to universal peace. All  these holy, divine Manifestations are one. They have served one God,  promulgated the same truth, founded the same institutions and reflected  the same light. Their appearances have been successive and correlated;  each one has announced and extolled the one who was to follow and all laid  the foundation of reality. They summoned and invited the people to love  and made the human world a mirror of the Word of God. Therefore the divine  religions they established have one foundation; their teachings, proofs  and evidences are one; in name and form they differ but in reality they  agree and are the same. These holy Manifestations have been as the coming  of springtime in the world. Although the springtime of this year is  designated by another name according to the changing calendar, yet as  regards its life and quickening it is the same as the springtime of last  year. For each spring is the time of a new creation, the effects,  bestowals, perfections and life-giving forces of which are the same as  those of the former vernal seasons although the names are many and  various. This is 1912, last year's was 1911 and so on, but in fundamental  reality no difference is apparent. The sun is one but the dawning-points  of the sun are numerous and changing. The ocean is one body of water but  different parts of it have particular designation, Atlantic, Pacific,  Mediterranean, Antarctic, etc. If we consider the names, there is  differentiation, but the water, the ocean itself is one reality.    Likewise the divine religions of the holy Manifestations of God are in  reality one though in name and nomenclature they differ. Man must be a  lover of the light no matter from what day-spring it may appear. He must  be a lover of the rose no matter in what soil it may be growing. He must  be a seeker of the truth no matter from what source it come. Attachment to  the lantern is not loving the light. Attachment to the earth is not  befitting but enjoyment of the rose which develops from the soil is  worthy. Devotion to the tree is profitless but partaking of the fruit is  beneficial. Luscious fruits no matter upon what tree they grow or where  they may be found must be enjoyed. The word of truth no matter which  tongue utters it must be sanctioned. Absolute verities no matter in what  book they be recorded must be accepted. If we harbor prejudice it will be  the cause of deprivation and ignorance. The strife between religions,  nations and races arises from misunderstanding. If we investigate the  religions to discover the principles underlying their foundations we will  find they agree, for the fundamental reality of them is one and not  multiple. By this means the religionists of the world will reach their  point of unity and reconciliation. They will ascertain the truth that the  purpose of religion is the acquisition of praiseworthy virtues, betterment  of morals, spiritual development of mankind, the real life and divine  bestowals. All the prophets have been the promoters of these principles;  none of them has been the promoter of corruption, vice or evil. They have  summoned mankind to all good. They have united people in the love of God,  invited them to the religions of the unity of mankind and exhorted them to  amity and agreement. For example, we mention Abraham and Moses. By this  mention we do not mean the limitation implied in the mere names but intend  the virtues which these names embody. When we say \"Abraham\" we mean  thereby a Manifestation of divine guidance, a center of human virtues, a  source of heavenly bestowals to mankind, a dawning-point of divine  inspiration and perfections. These perfections and graces are not limited  to names and boundaries. When we find these virtues, qualities and  attributes in any personality, we recognize the same reality shining from  within and bow in acknowledgment of the Abrahamic perfections. Similarly  we acknowledge and adore the beauty of Moses. Some souls were lovers of  the name Abraham, loving the lantern instead of the light and when they  saw this same light shining from another lantern they were so attached to  the former lantern that they did not recognize its later"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#2)"],[1,"may encompass. Love  is light in whatsoever house it may shine and enmity is darkness in  whatsoever abode it dwell.    O friends of God! Strive ye so that this darkness may be utterly dispelled  and the Hidden Mystery may be revealed and the realities of things made  evident and manifest.          I HAVE COME WITH THIS MISSION      I have come from distant lands to visit the meetings and assemblies of  this country. In every meeting I find people gathered loving each other;  therefore I am greatly pleased. The bond of union is evidenced in this  assembly today where the power of God has brought together in faith,  agreement and concord those who are engaged in furthering the development  of the human world. It is my hope that all mankind may become similarly  united in the bond and agreement of love. Unity is the expression of the  loving power of God and reflects the reality of divinity. It is  resplendent in this day through the bestowals of light upon humanity.    Throughout the universe the divine power is effulgent in endless images  and pictures. The world of creation, the world of humanity may be likened  to the earth itself and the divine power to the sun. This Sun has shone  upon all mankind. In the endless variety of its reflections the divine  will is manifested. Consider how all are recipients of the bounty of the  same Sun. At most the difference between them is that of degree, for the  effulgence is one effulgence, the one light emanating from the Sun. This  will express the oneness of the world of humanity. The body-politic or the  social unity of the human world may be likened to an ocean and each  member, each individual a wave upon that same ocean.    The light of the sun becomes apparent in each object according to the  capacity of that object. The difference is simply one of degree and  receptivity. The stone would be a recipient only to a limited extent;  another created thing might be as a mirror wherein the sun is fully  reflected; but the same light shines upon both.    The most important thing is to polish the mirrors of hearts in order that  they may become illumined and receptive of the divine light. One heart may  possess the capacity of the polished mirror; another be covered and  obscured by the dust and dross of this world. Although the same Sun is  shining upon both, in the mirror which is polished, pure and sanctified  you may behold the Sun in all its fullness, glory and power revealing its  majesty and effulgence, but in the mirror which is rusted and obscured  there is no capacity for reflection although so far as the Sun itself is  concerned it is shining thereon and is neither lessened nor deprived.  Therefore our duty lies in seeking to polish the mirrors of our hearts in  order that we shall become reflectors of that light and recipients of the  divine bounties which may be fully revealed through them.    This means the oneness of the world of humanity. That is to say, when this  human body-politic reaches a state of absolute unity, the effulgence of  the eternal Sun will make its fullest light and heat manifest. Therefore  we must not make distinctions between individual members of the human  family. We must not consider any soul as barren or deprived. Our duty lies  in educating souls so that the Sun of the bestowals of God shall become  resplendent in them, and this is possible through the power of the oneness  of humanity. The more love is expressed among mankind and the stronger the  power of unity, the greater will be this reflection and revelation, for  the greatest bestowal of God is love. Love is the source of all the  bestowals of God. Until love takes possession of the heart no other divine  bounty can be revealed in it.    All the prophets have striven to make love manifest in the hearts of men.  His Holiness Jesus Christ sought to create this love in the hearts. He  suffered all difficulties and ordeals that perchance the human heart might  become the fountain-source of love. Therefore we must strive with all our  heart and soul that this love may take possession of us so that all  humanity whether it be in the east or in the west may be connected through  the bond of this divine affection; for we are all the waves of one sea; we  have come into being through the same bestowal and are recipients from the  same center. The lights of earth are all acceptable, but the center of  effulgence is the sun and we must direct our gaze to the sun. God is the  supreme center. The more we turn toward this center of light, the greater  will be our capacity.    In the Orient there were great differences among races and peoples. They  hated each other and there was no association among them. Various and  divergent sects were hostile, irreconcilable. The different races were in  constant war and conflict. About sixty years ago Baha'u'llah appeared upon  the eastern horizon. He caused love and unity to become manifest among  these antagonistic peoples. He united them with the bond of love; their  former hatred and animosity passed away; love and unity reigned instead.  It was a dark world; it became radiant. A new springtime appeared through  him, for the Sun of Truth had risen again. In the fields and meadows of  human hearts variegated flowers of inner significance were blooming and  the good fruits of the kingdom of God became manifest.    I have come here with this mission; that through your endeavors, through  your heavenly morals, through your devoted efforts a perfect bond of unity  and love may be established between the east and the west, so that the  bestowals of God may descend upon all and that all may be seen to be the  parts of the same tree,--the great tree of the human family. For mankind  may be likened to the branches, leaves, blossoms and fruit of that tree.    The favors of God are unending, limitless. Infinite bounties have  encompassed the world. We must emulate the bounties of God, and just as  each one of them--the bounty of life for instance--surrounds and encompasses  all, so likewise must we be connected and blended together until each part  shall become the expression of the whole.    Consider; we plant a seed. A complete and perfect tree appears from it,  and from each seed of this tree another tree can be produced. Therefore  the part is expressive of the whole, for this seed was a part of the tree,  but therein potentially was the whole tree. So each one of us may become  expressive or representative of all the bounties of life to mankind. This  is the unity of the world of humanity. This is the bestowal of God. This  is the felicity of the human world and this is the manifestation of the  divine favor.          THE BLESSED PERFECTION, BAHA'U'LLAH      The Blessed Perfection Baha'u'llah belonged to the royal family of Iran.  From earliest childhood He was distinguished among His relatives and  friends. They said: \"This child has extraordinary power.\" In wisdom,  intelligence and as a source of new knowledge He was advanced beyond His  age and superior to His surroundings. All who knew Him were astonished at  his precocity. It was usual for them to say: \"Such a child will not live,\"  for it is commonly believed that precocious children do not reach  maturity. During the period of youth the Blessed Perfection did not enter  school. He was not willing to be taught. This fact is well established  among the Iranians of Tihran. Nevertheless He was capable of solving the  difficult problems of all who came to Him. In whatever meeting, scientific  assembly or theological discussion He was found, He became the authority  of explanation upon intricate and abstruse questions presented.    Until His father passed away Baha'u'llah did not seek position or  political station notwithstanding His connection with the government. This  occasioned surprise and comment. It was frequently said: \"How is it that a  young man of such keen intelligence and subtle perception does not seek  lucrative appointments? As a matter of fact every position is open to  him.\" This is a historical statement fully attested by the people of Iran.    He was most generous, giving abundantly to the poor. None who came to Him  were turned away. The doors of His house were open to all. He always had  many guests. This unbounded generosity was conducive to greater  astonishment from the fact that He sought neither position nor prominence.  In commenting upon this His friends said He would become impoverished, for  His expenses were many and His wealth becoming more and more limited. \"Why  is he not thinking of his own affairs?\", they inquired of each other; but  some who were wise declared: \"This personage is connected with another  world; he has something sublime within him that is not evident now; the  day is coming when it will be manifested.\" In truth the Blessed Perfection  was a refuge for every weak one, a shelter for every fearing one, kind to  every indigent one, lenient and loving to all creatures.    He became well known in regard to these qualities before His Holiness the  Bab appeared. Then Baha'u'llah declared the Bab's mission to be true and  promulgated His teachings. The Bab announced that the greater  manifestation would take place after Him and called the promised one: \"Him  whom God would manifest,\" saying that nine years later the reality of His  own mission would become apparent. In His writings He stated that in the  ninth year this expected one would be known; in the ninth year they would  attain to all glory and felicity; in the ninth year they would advance  rapidly. Between Baha'u'llah and the Bab there was communication  privately. The Bab wrote a letter containing three hundred and sixty  derivatives of the root \"Baha.\" The Bab was martyred in Tabriz, and  Baha'u'llah exiled into Iraq-Arabie in 1852, announced Himself in  Ba_gh_dad. For the Iranian Government had decided that as long as He  remained in Iran the peace of the country would be disturbed;"]]]
