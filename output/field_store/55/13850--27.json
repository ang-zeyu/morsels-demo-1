He was married three times, and by his first wife had three sons and one  daughter. The latter was Mary, and the sons were Charles, Edward, and  George, the last of whom became the famous Admiral of the American navy  and the hero of the late war between our country and Spain. He was born  in the old colonial house of Dr. Dewey, December 26, 1837.    George was a good specimen of the mischievous, high-spirited and  roystering youngster, who would go to any pains and run any risk for the  sake of the fun it afforded. This propensity was carried to such an  extent that the youth earned the name of being a \"bad boy,\" and there is  no use of pretending he did not deserve the reputation. He gave his  parents and neighbors a good deal of anxiety, and Dr. Dewey, who knew  how to be stern as well as kind, was compelled more than once to  interpose his authority in a way that no lad is likely to forget.    Dr. Dewey was a man of deep religious convictions. In middle life he  gave up the practice of medicine and founded the National Life Insurance  Company, to whose interests he devoted his time and ability, and met  with a good degree of success. George was gifted by nature with rugged  health, high spirits and indomitable pluck and fearlessness. None could  surpass him in running, leaping, swimming and in boyish sports. He was  fond of fishing and of rough games, and as a fighter few of his years  could stand in front of him. In numerous athletic trials he was  invariably the victor, and it must be admitted that he loved fighting as  well as he liked playing ball or fishing. He gave and received hard  knocks, and even at that early age showed evidence of the combative,  aggressive courage that became so marked a feature of his manhood.    An incident is related by Z.K. Pangborn, the well known editor of New  Jersey, who took charge of the Montpelier school, in which George Dewey  was a pupil. The school was notorious for the roughness of a number of  its pupils, who had ousted more than one instructor and welcomed the  chance to tackle a new one. Master Dewey was the ringleader of these  young rebels, and chuckled with delight when the quiet-looking,  ordinary-sized teacher sauntered down the highway to begin his duties in  the schoolroom.    At the time of the gentleman's appearance George was sitting astride of  a big limb in a tree at the side of the road, his pockets bulging with  stones, which he was hurling with unpleasant accuracy at every one who  came within range. Several youngsters were howling from having served as  targets to the urchin up the tree, and as soon as Mr. Pangborn saw how  things were going he shouted to Dewey to stop his sport. The boy replied  by advising the teacher to go to the hottest region named in works on  theology, and, descending the tree, led several young scamps in an  attack upon the instructor. There was a lively brush, in which it cannot  be said that either party was the victor.    A drawn battle is always unsatisfactory to two armies, and George  determined to have it out in the schoolroom with the teacher, who,  expecting the struggle, had prepared for it and was as eager as the  boys for the fight. As before, Dewey was the leader in the attack on  the pedagogue, who was wiry, active, and strong. He swung his rawhide  with a vigor that made Dewey and the others dance, but they pluckily  kept up the assault, until the instructor seized a big stick, intended  to serve as fuel for the old-fashioned stove, and laid about him with an  energy that soon stretched the rebels on the floor.    Then how he belabored them! As fast as one attempted to climb to his  feet he was thumped back again by the club that continually whizzed  through the air, and if a boy tried to stay the storm by remaining  prone, the instructor thumped him none the less viciously. Indeed,  matters had got to that point that he enjoyed the fun and was loath to  let up, as he felt obliged to do, when the howling rebels slunk to their  seats, thoroughly cowed and conquered.    George Dewey was the most battered of the lot and made a sorry sight. In  fact, he was so bruised that his teacher thought it prudent to accompany  him to his home and explain to his father the particulars of the affray  in school. Mr. Pangborn gave a detailed history of the occurrence, to  which Dr. Dewey listened gravely. When he understood everything, he  showed his good sense by thanking the teacher for having administered  the punishment, asking him to repeat it whenever the conduct of his son  made it necessary.    This chastisement marked a turning point in the boy's career. He did a  good deal of serious thinking throughout the day, and saw and felt his  wrongdoing. He became an attentive, obedient pupil, and years after,  when grown to manhood, he warmly thanked Mr. Pangborn for having  punished him with such severity, frankly adding: \"I believe if you  hadn't done so I should have ended my career in the penitentiary.\"    Dr. Dewey wished to give George a career in the army, and he sent him to  Norwich University, a military training school, in order to fit him for  the Military Academy at West Point. George's tastes, however, were for  the navy, and after much pleading with his father he brought him to his  way of thinking. The utmost that Dr. Dewey could do was to secure the  appointment of his son as alternate, who, as may be understood, secures  the appointment only in the event of the principal failing to pass the  entrance examination. In this case the principal would have passed  without trouble, and, to quote an ordinary expression, George Dewey  would have been \"left,\" had not the mother of the other boy interposed  at the critical moment. Under no circumstances would she allow her son  to enter the navy. He was compelled to give up all ambition in that  direction and to take up the study of theology. At this writing he is a  popular preacher, who will always believe it was a most providential  thing for our country that turned him aside from blocking the entrance  of George Dewey to the Naval Academy at Annapolis.    Our hero entered the institution September 23, 1854. It did not take him  long to discover that the institution, like that at West Point, is  controlled by the most rigid discipline possible. No stricter rules can  be devised than those that prevail at the two institutions. I have heard  it said by a West Point graduate that a cadet cannot sit down and  breathe for twenty-four hours without violating some rule. The fact that  a few men do escape being \"skinned\"--that is, punished for derelictions  of duty--does not prove that they have not committed any indiscretions,  but that they have escaped detection.    Hard, however, as was the road for Dewey to travel, he never shrank or  turned aside, for he knew the same path had been traveled by all who had  gone before him, and he reasoned that what man had done man could do,  and he did it.    It will be noted that the future Admiral entered the Naval Academy at a  stirring period in the history of our country, over which the coming  Civil War already cast its awful shadow, and, as the months and years  passed, the shadow darkened and grew more portentous until the red  lightning rent the clouds apart and they rained blood and fire and woe  and death.    At the Annapolis Academy the lines between the cadets from the North and  the South were sharply drawn. They reflected the passions of their  sections, and, being young and impulsive, there were hot words and  fierce blows. As might be supposed, George Dewey was prominent in these  affrays, for it has been said of him that there was never a fight in his  neighborhood without his getting into the thickest of it.    One day a fiery Southerner called him a dough-face, whereupon Dewey let  go straight from the shoulder and his insulter turned a backward  somersault. Leaping to his feet, his face aflame with rage, he went at  the Green Mountain Boy, who coolly awaited his attack, and they  proceeded instantly to mix it up for some fifteen minutes in the most  lively manner conceivable. At the end of that time the Southerner was so  thoroughly trounced that he was unable to continue the fight.    It was not long before Dewey had a furious scrimmage with another  cadet, whom he soundly whipped. He challenged Dewey to a duel, and Dewey  instantly accepted the challenge. Seconds were chosen, weapons provided  and the ground paced off. By that time the friends of the two parties,  seeing that one of the young men, and possibly both, were certain to be  killed, interfered, and, appealing to the authorities of the  institution, the deadly meeting was prevented. These incidents attest  the personal daring of Admiral Dewey, of whom it has been said that he  never showed fear of any living man. Often during his stirring career  was the attempt made to frighten him, and few have been placed in so  many situations of peril and come out of them alive, but in none did he  ever display anything that could possibly be mistaken for timidity. He  was a brave man and a patriot in every fibre of his being.    A youth can be combative, personally brave and aggressive, and still be  a good student, as was proven by the graduation of Dewey, fifth in a  class of fourteen. As was the custom, he was ordered to a cruise before  his final examination. He was a cadet on the steam frigate _Wabash_,  which cruised in the Mediterranean squadron until 1859, when he returned  to Annapolis and, upon examination, took rank as the leader of his  class, proof that he had spent his time wisely while on what may be  called his trial cruise. He went to his old home in Montpelier, where he  was spending the days with his friends, when the country was startled  and electrified by the news that Fort Sumter had been fired on in  Charleston harbor and that civil war had begun. Dewey's patriotic blood  was at "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1726"],[0,"Theaetetus (#2)"],[1,"the friend and disciple of  Protagoras, but he is very reluctant to leave his retirement and defend  his old master. He is too old to learn Socrates' game of question and  answer, and prefers the digressions to the main argument, because he  finds them easier to follow. The mathematician, as Socrates says in the  Republic, is not capable of giving a reason in the same manner as the  dialectician, and Theodorus could not therefore have been appropriately  introduced as the chief respondent. But he may be fairly appealed to,  when the honour of his master is at stake. He is the 'guardian of his  orphans,' although this is a responsibility which he wishes to throw  upon Callias, the friend and patron of all Sophists, declaring that  he himself had early 'run away' from philosophy, and was absorbed in  mathematics. His extreme dislike to the Heraclitean fanatics, which may  be compared with the dislike of Theaetetus to the materialists, and his  ready acceptance of the noble words of Socrates, are noticeable traits  of character.    The Socrates of the Theaetetus is the same as the Socrates of the  earlier dialogues. He is the invincible disputant, now advanced in  years, of the Protagoras and Symposium; he is still pursuing his divine  mission, his 'Herculean labours,' of which he has described the origin  in the Apology; and he still hears the voice of his oracle, bidding him  receive or not receive the truant souls. There he is supposed to have  a mission to convict men of self-conceit; in the Theaetetus he has  assigned to him by God the functions of a man-midwife, who delivers men  of their thoughts, and under this character he is present throughout the  dialogue. He is the true prophet who has an insight into the natures  of men, and can divine their future; and he knows that sympathy is the  secret power which unlocks their thoughts. The hit at Aristides, the son  of Lysimachus, who was specially committed to his charge in the Laches,  may be remarked by the way. The attempt to discover the definition  of knowledge is in accordance with the character of Socrates as he  is described in the Memorabilia, asking What is justice? what is  temperance? and the like. But there is no reason to suppose that he  would have analyzed the nature of perception, or traced the connexion  of Protagoras and Heracleitus, or have raised the difficulty respecting  false opinion. The humorous illustrations, as well as the serious  thoughts, run through the dialogue. The snubnosedness of Theaetetus, a  characteristic which he shares with Socrates, and the man-midwifery  of Socrates, are not forgotten in the closing words. At the end of the  dialogue, as in the Euthyphro, he is expecting to meet Meletus at the  porch of the king Archon; but with the same indifference to the result  which is everywhere displayed by him, he proposes that they shall  reassemble on the following day at the same spot. The day comes, and  in the Sophist the three friends again meet, but no further allusion is  made to the trial, and the principal share in the argument is assigned,  not to Socrates, but to an Eleatic stranger; the youthful Theaetetus  also plays a different and less independent part. And there is no  allusion in the Introduction to the second and third dialogues, which  are afterwards appended. There seems, therefore, reason to think that  there is a real change, both in the characters and in the design.    The dialogue is an enquiry into the nature of knowledge, which is  interrupted by two digressions. The first is the digression about the  midwives, which is also a leading thought or continuous image, like the  wave in the Republic, appearing and reappearing at intervals. Again and  again we are reminded that the successive conceptions of knowledge are  extracted from Theaetetus, who in his turn truly declares that Socrates  has got a great deal more out of him than ever was in him. Socrates is  never weary of working out the image in humorous details,--discerning  the symptoms of labour, carrying the child round the hearth, fearing  that Theaetetus will bite him, comparing his conceptions to wind-eggs,  asserting an hereditary right to the occupation. There is also a serious  side to the image, which is an apt similitude of the Socratic theory  of education (compare Republic, Sophist), and accords with the ironical  spirit in which the wisest of men delights to speak of himself.    The other digression is the famous contrast of the lawyer and  philosopher. This is a sort of landing-place or break in the middle of  the dialogue. At the commencement of a great discussion, the reflection  naturally arises, How happy are they who, like the philosopher, have  time for such discussions (compare Republic)! There is no reason for the  introduction of such a digression; nor is a reason always needed, any  more than for the introduction of an episode in a poem, or of a topic in  conversation. That which is given by Socrates is quite sufficient, viz.  that the philosopher may talk and write as he pleases. But though not  very closely connected, neither is the digression out of keeping with  the rest of the dialogue. The philosopher naturally desires to pour  forth the thoughts which are always present to him, and to discourse of  the higher life. The idea of knowledge, although hard to be defined, is  realised in the life of philosophy. And the contrast is the favourite  antithesis between the world, in the various characters of sophist,  lawyer, statesman, speaker, and the philosopher,--between opinion and  knowledge,--between the conventional and the true.    The greater part of the dialogue is devoted to setting up and throwing  down definitions of science and knowledge. Proceeding from the lower to  the higher by three stages, in which perception, opinion, reasoning are  successively examined, we first get rid of the confusion of the idea of  knowledge and specific kinds of knowledge,--a confusion which has been  already noticed in the Lysis, Laches, Meno, and other dialogues. In  the infancy of logic, a form of thought has to be invented before the  content can be filled up. We cannot define knowledge until the nature of  definition has been ascertained. Having succeeded in making his meaning  plain, Socrates proceeds to analyze (1) the first definition which  Theaetetus proposes: 'Knowledge is sensible perception.' This is  speedily identified with the Protagorean saying, 'Man is the measure  of all things;' and of this again the foundation is discovered in the  perpetual flux of Heracleitus. The relativeness of sensation is then  developed at length, and for a moment the definition appears to be  accepted. But soon the Protagorean thesis is pronounced to be suicidal;  for the adversaries of Protagoras are as good a measure as he is, and  they deny his doctrine. He is then supposed to reply that the perception  may be true at any given instant. But the reply is in the end shown to  be inconsistent with the Heraclitean foundation, on which the doctrine  has been affirmed to rest. For if the Heraclitean flux is extended to  every sort of change in every instant of time, how can any thought  or word be detained even for an instant? Sensible perception, like  everything else, is tumbling to pieces. Nor can Protagoras himself  maintain that one man is as good as another in his knowledge of the  future; and 'the expedient,' if not 'the just and true,' belongs to the  sphere of the future.    And so we must ask again, What is knowledge? The comparison of  sensations with one another implies a principle which is above  sensation, and which resides in the mind itself. We are thus led to look  for knowledge in a higher sphere, and accordingly Theaetetus, when again  interrogated, replies (2) that 'knowledge is true opinion.' But how is  false opinion possible? The Megarian or Eristic spirit within us revives  the question, which has been already asked and indirectly answered in  the Meno: 'How can a man be ignorant of that which he knows?' No answer  is given to this not unanswerable question. The comparison of the mind  to a block of wax, or to a decoy of birds, is found wanting.    But are we not inverting the natural order in looking for opinion before  we have found knowledge? And knowledge is not true opinion; for the  Athenian dicasts have true opinion but not knowledge. What then  is knowledge? We answer (3), 'True opinion, with definition or  explanation.' But all the different ways in which this statement may be  understood are set aside, like the definitions of courage in the Laches,  or of friendship in the Lysis, or of temperance in the Charmides. At  length we arrive at the conclusion, in which nothing is concluded.    There are two special difficulties which beset the student of the  Theaetetus: (1) he is uncertain how far he can trust Plato's account of  the theory of Protagoras; and he is also uncertain (2) how far, and in  what parts of the dialogue, Plato is expressing his own opinion.  The dramatic character of the work renders the answer to both these  questions difficult.    1. In reply to the first, we have only probabilities to offer. Three  main points have to be decided: (a) Would Protagoras have identified  his own thesis, 'Man is the measure of all things,' with the other,  'All knowledge is sensible perception'? (b) Would he have based the  relativity of knowledge on the Heraclitean flux? (c) Would he have  asserted the absoluteness of sensation at each instant? Of the work of  Protagoras on 'Truth' we know nothing, with the exception of the two  famous fragments, which are cited in this dialogue, 'Man is the measure  of all things,' and, 'Whether there are gods or not, I cannot tell.' Nor  have we any other trustworthy evidence of the tenets of Protagoras, or  of the sense in which his words are used. For later writers, including  Aristotle in his Metaphysics, have mixed up the Protagoras of Plato, as  they have the "]]]
