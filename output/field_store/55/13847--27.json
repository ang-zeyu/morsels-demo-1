Jeddah is indeed in the pilgrim season the suburb of a great metropolis,  and even a European stranger there feels that he is no longer in a world  of little thoughts and local aspirations. On every side the politics he  hears discussed are those of the great world, and the religion  professed is that of a wider Islam than he has been accustomed to in  Turkey or in India. There every race and language are represented, and  every sect. Indians, Persians, Moors, are there,--negroes from the  Niger, Malays from Java, Tartars from the Khanates, Arabs from the  French Sahara, from Oman and Zanzibar, even, in Chinese dress and  undistinguishable from other natives of the Celestial Empire, Mussulmans  from the interior of China. As one meets these walking in the streets,  one's view of Islam becomes suddenly enlarged, and one finds oneself  exclaiming with Sir Thomas Browne, \"Truly the (Mussulman) world is  greater than that part of it geographers have described.\" The permanent  population, too, of Jeddah is a microcosm of Islam. It is made up of  individuals from every nation under heaven. Besides the indigenous Arab,  who has given his language and his tone of thought to the rest, there is  a mixed resident multitude descended from the countless pilgrims who  have remained to live and die in the holy cities. These preserve, to a  certain extent, their individuality, at least for a generation or two,  and maintain a connection with the lands to which they owe their origin  and the people who were their countrymen. Thus there is constantly  found at Jeddah a free mart of intelligence for all that is happening in  the world; and the common gossip of the bazaar retails news from every  corner of the Mussulman earth. It is hardly too much to say that one can  learn more of modern Islam in a week at Jeddah than in a year elsewhere,  for there the very shopkeepers discourse of things divine, and even the  Frank Vice-Consuls prophesy. The Hejazi is less shy, too, of discussing  religious matters than his fellow Mussulmans are in other places.  Religion is, as it were, part of his stock-in-trade, and he is  accustomed to parade it before strangers. With a European he may do this  a little disdainfully, but still he will do it, and with less disguise  or desire to please than is in most places the case. Moreover--and this  is important--it is almost always the practical side of questions that  the commercial Jeddan will put forward. He sees things from a political  and economical point of view, rather than a doctrinal, and if fanatical,  he is so from the same motives, and no others, which once moved the  citizens of Ephesus to defend the worship of their shrines.    In other cities, Cairo and Constantinople excepted, the Ulema, or  learned men, of whom a stranger might seek instruction, would be found  busying themselves mainly with doctrinal matters not always interesting  at the present day, old-world arguments of Koranic interpretation which  have from time immemorial occupied the schools. But here even these are  treated practically, and as they bear on the political aspect of the  hour. For myself, I became speedily impressed with the advantage thus  afforded me, and neglected no opportunity which offered itself for  listening and asking questions, so that without pretending to the  possession of more special skill than any intelligent inquirer might  command, I obtained a mass of information I cannot but think to be of  great value--while this in its turn served me later as an introduction  to such Mussulman divines as I afterwards met in the North. Jeddah then  realized all my hopes and gratified nearly all my curiosities. I will  own, too, to having come away with more than a gratified curiosity, and  to having found new worlds of thought and life in an atmosphere I had  fancied to be only of decay. I was astonished at the vigorous life of  Islam, at its practical hopes and fears in this modern nineteenth  century, and above all at its reality as a moral force; so that if I had  not exactly come to scoff, I certainly remained, in a certain sense, to  pray. At least I left it interested, as I had never thought to be, in  the great struggle which seemed to me impending between the parties of  reaction in Islam and reform, and not a little hopeful as to its  favourable issue. What this is likely to be I now intend to discuss.    First, however, it will I think be as well to survey briefly the actual  composition of the Mohammedan world. It is only by a knowledge of the  elements of which Islam is made up that we can guess its future, and  these are less generally known than they should be. A stranger from  Europe visiting the Hejaz is, as I have said, irresistibly struck with  the vastness of the religious world in whose centre he stands.  Mohammedanism to our Western eyes seems almost bounded by the limits of  the Ottoman Empire. The Turk stands in our foreground, and has stood  there from the days of Bajazet, and in our vulgar tongue his name is  still synonymous with Moslem, so that we are apt to look upon him as, if  not the only, at least the chief figure of Islam. But from Arabia we see  things in a truer perspective, and become aware that beyond and without  the Ottoman dominions there are races and nations, no less truly  followers of the Prophet, beside whom the Turk shrinks into numerical  insignificance. We catch sight, it may be for the first time in their  real proportions, of the old Persian and Mogul monarchies, of the forty  million Mussulmans of India, of the thirty million Malays, of the  fifteen million Chinese, and the vast and yet uncounted Mohammedan  populations of Central Africa. We see, too, how important is still the  Arabian element, and how necessary it is to count with it, in any  estimate we may form of Islam's possible future. Turkey, meanwhile, and  Constantinople, retire to a rather remote horizon, and the Mussulman  centre of gravity is as it were shifted from the north and west towards  the south and east.    I was at some pains while at Jeddah to gain accurate statistics of the  Haj according to the various races and sects composing it, and with them  of the populations they in some measure represent. The pilgrimage is of  course no certain guide as to the composition of the Mussulman world,  for many accidents of distance and political circumstance interfere with  calculations based on it. Still to a certain extent a proportion is  preserved between it and the populations which supply it; and in default  of better, statistics of the Haj afford us an index not without value of  the degree of religious vitality existing in the various Mussulman  countries. My figures, which for convenience I have arranged in tabular  form, are taken principally from an official record, kept for some years  past at Jeddah, of the pilgrims landed at that port, and checked as far  as European subjects are concerned by reference to the consular agents  residing there. They may therefore be relied upon as fairly accurate;  while for the land pilgrimage I trust in part my own observations, made  three years ago, in part statistics obtained at Cairo and Damascus. For  the table of population in the various lands of Islam I am obliged to go  more directly to European sources of information. As may be supposed, no  statistics on this point of any value were obtainable at Jeddah; but by  taking the figures commonly given in our handbooks, and supplementing  and correcting these by reference to such persons as I could find who  knew the countries, I have, I hope, arrived at an approximation to the  truth, near enough to give a tolerable idea to general readers of the  numerical proportions of Islam. Strict accuracy, however, I do not here  pretend to, nor would it if obtainable materially help my present  argument.    The following is my table:--      TABLE OF THE MECCA PILGRIMAGE OF 1880.                                             |        |        | Total of    Nationality of Pilgrims.               |Arriving|Arriving| Mussulman                                           |by Sea. |by Land.| population                                           |        |        | represented.  -----------------------------------------+--------+--------+------------  Ottoman subjects including pilgrims from |        |        |    Syria and Irak, but not from Egypt or  |        |        |    Arabia proper                          |  8,500 |  1,000 | 22,000,000                                           |        |        |  Egyptians                                |  5,000 |  1,000 |  5,000,000                                           |        |        |  Mogrebbins (\"people of the West\"), that  |        |        |    is to say Arabic-speaking Mussulmans   |        |        |    from the Barbary States, Tripoli,      |        |        |    Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco.

Leaves two children.\" Yet once, while he was alive, before he  painted _The Night Watch_, he had been the most famous painter in Holland.  Later, oblivion encompassed the old lion, and little he cared so long as he  could work at his art. Forty years after his death, Gerard de Lairesse, a  popular painter, now forgotten, wrote of Rembrandt--\"In his efforts to  attain a yellow manner, Rembrandt merely achieved an effect of  rottenness.... The vulgar and prosaic aspects of a subject were the only  ones he was capable of noting.\" Poor Gerard de Lairesse!    To-day not a turn or a twist of his life, not a facet of his temperament,  not an individual of his family, friends, or acquaintances, not the  slightest scrap of paper bearing the mark of his hand, but has been peered  into, scrutinised, tracked to its source, and written about voluminously.  The bibliography of Rembrandt would fill a library. Several lengthy and  learned catalogues of his works have been published in volumes so large  that a child could not lift one of them. His 450 pictures, his  multitudinous drawings, his 270 etchings, their authenticity, their  history, their dates, the identification of his models, have been the  subjects of innumerable books and essays. Why, it would have taken our  golfer three months just to read what has been written about one of  Rembrandt's pictures--that known as _The Night Watch_. He might have begun  with Bredius and Meyer of Holland, and M. Durand-Greville of France, and  would then have been only at the beginning of his task. People make the  long journey to St. Petersburg for the sake of the 35 pictures by Rembrandt  that the Hermitage contains. He is hailed to-day as the greatest etcher the  world has ever known, and there are some who place him at the head of that  noble triumvirate who stand on the summit of the painters' Parnassus,  Velasquez, Titian, and Rembrandt. Having browsed and battened on Rembrandt,  and noted the countless cosmopolitan workers that for fifty years have been  excavating the country marked on the art map Rembrandt, you can perhaps  understand why our golfer likened the work of his commentators to the  incessant activity that his upturning of that grey, lichen-covered boulder  revealed.    [Illustration: THE HOLY FAMILY WITH THE ANGELS    1645. The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]    But had our golfer, brimming with the modern passion for efficiency,  learned foreign tongues, and browsed in the musty archives, he would have  discovered that there was much to unlearn. The early scribes piled fancy  upon invention, believing or pretending that Rembrandt was a miser, a  profligate, a spendthrift, and so on. \"Houbraken's facts,\" we read, \"are  interwoven with a mass of those suspicious anecdotes which adorn the plain  tale of so many artistic biographies. Campo-Weyermann, Dargenville,  Descamps, and others added further embellishments, boldly piling fable upon  fable for the amusement of their readers, till legend gradually ousted  truth.\"    All this and much more he would have had to unlearn, discovering in the end  the simple truth that Rembrandt lived for his art; that he loved and was  kind to his wife and to the servant girl who, when Saskia died, filled her  place; that he was neither saint nor sinner; that he was extravagant  because beautiful things cost money; that being an artist he did not manage  his affairs with the wisdom of a man of the world; that he was hot-headed,  and played a hot-headed man's part in the family quarrels; and that he was  plucky and improvident, and probably untidy to the end, and that he did his  best work when the buffets of fate were heaviest.    The new era in Rembrandt literature began with Kolloff's _Rembrandt's Leben  und Werke_, published in 1854. This contribution to truth was followed by  the works of Messrs. Buerger and Vosmaer, by the lucubrations of other  meritorious bookworms, by the studies of Messrs. Bode and Bredius, and  finally by M. Emile Michel's Life, which is the definitive and standard  work on Rembrandt. Our golfer, whose French is a little rusty, was  delighted to find when he gave the order for this book that it had been  translated into English under the editorship of Mr. Frederick Wedmore. It  was in the third edition.    He learned much from M. Emile Michel--among other things the herculean  labour that is necessary if one desires to write a standard and definitive  book on a subject. Not only did M. Michel visit and revisit all the  galleries where Rembrandt's pictures are displayed in Russia, France,  England, Sweden, Denmark, and North Germany, but he lived for several years  with Rembrandt, surrounded by reproductions of his pictures, drawings, and  etchings, and by documents bearing on their history, his mind all the while  intently fixed on the facts of Rembrandt's life and the achievements of his  genius. Gradually the procession of dates and facts took on a new  significance; the heterogeneous threads of information wove themselves into  the fabric of a life. M. Michel is the recoverer-in-chief of all that truly  happened during the sixty-three years that Rembrandt passed upon this  earth.    Every dead painter, poet, or writer of genius, has had his Recoverer. A  searchlight has flashed upon all that Charles Lamb said, did, or wrote.  Every forerunner who inspired Keats, from the day when he took the _Faerie  Queene_ like a fever, and went through it \"as a young horse through a  spring meadow, romping,\" has been considered and analysed. You could bury  Keats and Lamb in the tomes that have been written about them. With the  books of his commentators you could raise a mighty monument of paper and  bindings to Rembrandt.    All this is very right and most worthy of regard. We do not sing \"For they  are jolly good fellows\" in their honour, but we offer them our profound  respect and gratitude. And our golfer, in his amateurish way, belongs to  the tribe. He has approached Rembrandt through books. His temperament  enjoyed exploring the library hive marked Rembrandt. Now he feels that he  must study the works of the master, and while he is cogitating whether he  shall first examine the 35 pictures at St. Petersburg, or the 20 in the  Louvre, or the 20 at Cassel, or the 17 at Berlin, or the 16 at Dresden, or  the 12 in the National Gallery, or the etchings and drawings in the print  room of the British Museum, or the frame of etchings at South Kensington,  so accessible, I drop him. Yes: drop him in favour of another who did not  care two pins about the history or the politics of art, or the rights or  wrongs of Rembrandt's life, but went straight to his pictures and etchings,  wondered at them, and was filled with an incommunicable joy.          CHAPTER II    THE APPEAL OF THE PAINTINGS      Suppose our citizen and golfer, deliberately dropped in the preceding  chapter, had a child, a son, who by a freak of heredity was brooding and  imaginative, fond, in a childish way, of pictures and books, but quite  indifferent to scientific criticism and the methods of the analytic men.  During his school holidays his mother would take him to the pantomime, and  to the National Gallery. Dazed, he would scan the walls of pictures,  wondering why so many of them dealt with Scriptural subjects, and why some  were so coloured, and others so dim.    [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF A SAVANT    1631. The Hermitage, St. Petersburg.]    But after the third or fourth visit this child began to recognise  favourites among the pictures, and being somewhat melancholy and mystical  by nature, liking trees, beechwood glades, cathedral aisles, and the end of  day, he would drag upon his mother's arm when they passed two pictures  hanging together in the Dutch room. One was called _The Woman taken in  Adultery_, the other, _The Adoration of the Shepherds_. These pictures by  Rembrandt attracted him: they were so different from anything else in the  gallery. He did not trouble to understand their meaning; he did not dwell  upon the beauty of the still figure of Christ, or note that the  illumination in _The Adoration of the Shepherds_ proceeded from the  supernatural light that shines from the Infant Jesus. What captivated him  was the vastness contained in these small pictures, and the eerie way in  which the light was separated from the dark. He had never seen anything  like it before, but these pictures made him long to be grown up and able to  seek such sights. He could see the lurking shadows alone in his bed at  night, and held his breath when he thought of the great darkness that  stretched out to the frames of the pictures. He wondered if temples were  really as mysterious and dim as the great building that loomed above the  small dazzling figure of the kneeling penitent and that horrid man who, his  mother told him, was one of her accusers.    When she came into his bedroom to see that he was safely tucked up for the  night, this child asked his mother why Rembrandt's pictures were so  different from the pictures of other painters.    She explained that Rembrandt was a great master of _chiaroscuro_, making a  valiant attempt to pronounce the uncomfortable word.    \"What does that mean?\" asked the little boy.    \"It--er--means--One moment, dear; I think I hear your father calling.\"    She ran downstairs and consulted the dictionary.    \"A _chiaroscurist_,\" she told her little boy when she returned to the  bedroom, \"is a painter who cares for and studies light and shade rather  than colour. Now go to sleep. You're too young to bother about such  things.\"    This child's mother was an ardent Ruskinian. Observing that her husband,  the citizen and golfer, was asleep in his chair when she returned from her  son's bedroom, she stepped into the library, picked _Modern Painters_ from  the shelf, and read the following passages, gravely shaking her head  occasionally as she read.    \"..."]]]
