Facing the Court of the Universe       moves a group of men and women typical of those who have       made our civilization. From left to right appear the       French-Canadian, the Alaskan, the Latin-American, the       German, the Italian, the Anglo-American, and the American       Indian, squaw and warrior. In the place of honor in the       center of the group, standing between the oxen on the tongue       of the prairie schooner, is a figure, beautiful and almost       girlish, but strong, dignified, and womanly, the Mother of       To-morrow. Above the group rides the Spirit of Enterprise,       flanked right and left by the Hopes of the Future in the       person of two boys. The group as a whole is beautifully       symbolic of the westward march of American civilization.

Her father, the Duke of Kent, married the Dowager Princess of  Leiningen, who was the sister of Prince Leopold, afterward King of  the Belgians. As a young man the Duke had seen much service, for when  he was only seventeen years of age he entered the Hanoverian army,  where the discipline was severe and rigid. He afterward served in  the West Indies and Canada, and on his return to England he was made  a peer with the title of Duke of Kent. He was afterward General and  Commander-in-Chief in Canada and Governor of Gibraltar.    At the latter place his love of order and discipline naturally made  him unpopular, and, owing to strong feeling on the part of the troops,  it was considered wise to recall the Duke in 1803.    In 1816 he settled in Brussels, and soon afterward met his future  wife in Germany. Princess Victoire Marie Louise was the youngest  daughter of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and widow of Prince Charles of  Leiningen, who on his death had left her as the regent of his  principality.    They were married at Coburg in May 1818. Some months afterward they  came over to England, and on May 24, 1819, their daughter Alexandrina  Victoria was born.    [Illustration: The Duke of Kent  Sir Wm. Beechey  Photo W.A. Mansell & Co.]    [Illustration: The Duchess of Kent and Princess Victoria  Sir Wm. Beechey  Photo W.A. Mansell & Co.]    The Duke still kept up his simple, soldierly habits, for throughout  his life he had always believed in regularly ordering one's day. He  rose betimes and took a cup of coffee at six o'clock. Each servant  of the household was allotted his or her regular duties, and was  obliged at least once a day to appear before the Duke. There was a  separate bell for each servant, and punctuality in attendance was  insisted upon.    The christening was attended by members of the Royal Family, and a  dinner was held to celebrate the happy event. The Duke and Duchess  removed soon afterward to Devonshire, and they were both much pleased  with the beautiful surroundings of their new home. The Duke wrote  at this time of his daughter: \"My little girl thrives under the  influence of a Devonshire climate, and is, I am delighted to say,  strong and healthy; too healthy, I fear, in the opinion of some  members of my family, by whom she is regarded as an intruder. How  largely she contributes to my happiness at this moment it is needless  for me to say to you.\"    The Duke had been determined from the first that his child should  be born in England, for he wished her to be English both in upbringing  and in feeling. His wife, who is described by those who knew her as  being a singularly attractive woman, full of deep feeling and  sympathy, fully shared his views on this point.    In January 1820, when only fifty-three years of age, the Duke died  quite suddenly from inflammation of the lungs, following upon a  neglected cold. He was a man of deep religious feeling, and once in  talking to a friend about his little daughter's future career he said  earnestly: \"Don't pray simply that hers may be a brilliant career,  and exempt from those trials and struggles which have pursued her  father, but pray that God's blessing may rest on her, that it may  overshadow her, and that in all her coming years she may be guided  and guarded by God.\"    The widowed mother now returned to London, where the Duchess of  Clarence, afterward Queen Adelaide, interested herself greatly in  little Victoria. The Duchess now devoted herself entirely to the care  of her child, and never did any little girl have a more loving and  devoted mother.    As much time as possible was spent in the open air, and Victoria went  for rides about Kensington on a donkey, which was led by an old  soldier, a great friend and favourite. She always had her breakfast  and supper with her mother, and at nine o'clock retired to her bed,  which was placed close to her mother's. Until the time of her  accession she led as simple and regular a life as thousands of other  little girls.    Many stories are told of her early years to illustrate the  thoroughness of her home training. Even as a small child she was  absolutely truthful, and her chief fault--that of wilfulness--was  due to some extent to her high spirits and abundant energy. She was  especially fond of dolls, and possessed a very large number, most  of which were dressed as historical personages. She had practically  no playmates of her own age, and in later life she often spoke of  these early years as being rather dull.    A description of her at this period runs: \"She was a beautiful child,  with the cherubic form of features, clustered round by glossy, fair  ringlets. Her complexion was remarkably transparent, with a soft and  often heightening tinge of the sweet blush rose upon her cheeks that  imparted a peculiar brilliancy to her clear blue eyes. Whenever she  met any strangers in her usual paths she always seemed by the  quickness of her glance to inquire who and what they were.\"    There was, as was natural, much correspondence between England and  Saxe-Coburg, the home of the Duchess, for the second son of the Duke  of Coburg, Charles Albert Augustus Emmanuel, was already spoken of  as being destined to be Victoria's husband in the future.    Prince Albert had been born at Rosenau on August 19, 1819, and was  thus slightly younger than his cousin. He is spoken of as being a  very handsome boy, \"like a little angel with his fair curls,\" and  was for a time much spoilt until his father interfered and  superintended the children's education himself.    Ernest, the elder son, gives us a charming picture of his father:    \"We children beheld in him, and justly, our ideal of courtesy, and  although he never said a harsh word to us, we bore towards him,  through all our love and confidence, a reverence bordering on fear.  He never lectured, seldom blamed; praised unwillingly; and yet the  effect of his individuality was so powerful that we accomplished more  than if we had been praised or blamed. When he was once asked by a  relative whether we were industrious and well behaved, he answered:  'My children cannot be naughty, and as they know well that they must  learn in order to be worthy men, so I do not trouble myself about  it.'\"    The Duke liked both his sons to listen to the conversation of their  elders and to take an interest in art and literature. Outdoor  exercise, riding, fishing, hunting, and driving formed part of their  education; they were taught from the first to endure cold and  discomfort without complaint or murmur. The religious teaching they  received had a deep and lasting influence upon the two boys, both  at that time and in later years. But they had a thoroughly happy  boyhood and did not suffer from a lack of companions. After their  confirmation their father took them on a visit to several Courts in  Germany, and also to Vienna--a journey which was intended to open  their minds to the great world of which they had learnt so much and  seen so little; and it was about this time that King Leopold, the  brother of the Duke of Coburg, thought it wise to make a careful  inquiry into the life and character of the young Prince.          CHAPTER III: _Early Years_        God save thee, weeping Queen!      Thou shalt be well beloved!      The tyrant's sceptre cannot move,      As those pure tears have moved!                               E.B. BROWNING      When she was five years old the Princess Victoria began to have  lessons, chiefly with a governess, Miss von Lehzen--\"my dearly  beloved angelic Lehzen,\" as she called her. These two remained  devotedly attached to one another until the latter's death in 1870.  The young Princess was especially fond of music and drawing, and it  was clear that if she had been able to devote more time to study she  would in later years have excelled in both subjects.    Her education was such as to fit her for her future position of Queen  of England. The Princess did not, however, know that she was likely  at any future time to be Queen. She read much, chiefly books dealing  with history, and these were often chosen for her by her uncle, the  King of the Belgians.    The family life was regular and simple. Lessons, a walk or drive,  very few and simple pleasures made up her day. Breakfast was at  half-past eight, luncheon at half-past one, and dinner at seven. Tea  was allowed only in later years as a great treat.    The Queen herself said: \"I was brought up very simply--never had a  room to myself till I was nearly grown up--always slept in my mother's  room till I came to the throne.\"    Sir Walter Scott wrote of her at this period of her life: \"This little  lady is educated with much care, and watched so closely that no busy  maid has a moment to whisper, 'You are heir of England.' I suspect  if we could dissect the little heart, we should find some pigeon or  other bird of the air had carried the matter.\"    In 1830 her uncle, George the Fourth, died, and his brother, William  the Fourth, came to the throne. The young Princess was now the next  in succession. Her governess thought that her pupil should be told  of this fact, and as the Duchess of Kent agreed, the table of  genealogy was placed inside Victoria's history book, where by and  by she found it.    The story goes that she then said, \"I see, I am nearer the throne  than I thought,\" and giving her hand to her governess added: \"I will  be good. I understand now, why you urged me so much to learn, even  Latin.
