The body was further wrapped in  several bandages, then in a second piece of stuff, then in more bands,  the whole being finally covered with a shroud of coarse canvas and a  red linen winding-sheet, sewn together at the back, and kept in place by  transverse bands disposed at intervals from head to foot. The son of the  deceased and a \"man of the roll\" were present at this lugubrious toilet,  and recited at the application of each piece a prayer, in which its  object was defined and its duration secured. Every Egyptian was supposed  to be acquainted with the formulas, from having learned them during his  lifetime, by which he was to have restored to him the use of his limbs,  and be protected from the dangers of the world beyond. These were  repeated to the dead person, however, for greater security, during the  process of embalming, and the son of the deceased, or the master of the  ceremonies, took care to whisper to the mummy the most mysterious parts,  which no living ear might hear with impunity. The wrappings having  been completed, the deceased person became aware of his equipment, and  enjoyed all the privileges of the \"instructed and fortified Manes.\" He  felt himself, both mummy and double, now ready for the tomb.    Egyptian funerals were not like those to which we are accustomed--mute  ceremonies, in which sorrow is barely expressed by a furtive tear:  noise, sobbings, and wild gestures were their necessary concomitants.  Not only was it customary to hire weeping women, who tore their hair,  filled the air with their lamentations, and simulated by skilful actions  the depths of despair, but the relatives and friends themselves did not  shrink from making an outward show of their grief, nor from disturbing  the equanimity of the passers-by by the immoderate expressions of their  sorrow. One after another they raised their voices, and uttered some  expression appropriate to the occasion: \"To the West, the dwelling of  Osiris, to the West, thou who wast the best of men, and who always hated  guile.\" And the hired weepers answered in chorus: \"O chief,* as thou  goest to the West, the gods themselves lament.\" The funeral _cortege_  started in the morning from the house of mourning, and proceeded at a  slow pace to the Nile, amid the clamours of the mourners.         * The \"chief\" is one of the names of Osiris, and is applied       naturally to the dead person, who has become an Osiris by       virtue of the embalming.    The route was cleared by a number of slaves and retainers. First came  those who carried cakes and flowers in their hands, followed by others  bearing jars full of water, bottles of liqueurs, and phials of perfumes;  then came those who carried painted boxes intended for the provisions  of the dead man, and for containing the Ushabtiu, or \"Respondents.\" The  succeeding group bore the usual furniture required by the deceased  to set up house again, coffers for linen, folding and arm chairs,  state-beds, and sometimes even a caparisoned chariot with its quivers.  Then came a groom conducting two of his late master's favourite horses,  who, having accompanied the funeral to the tomb, were brought back  to their stable. Another detachment, more numerous than the others  combined, now filed past, bearing the effects of the mummy; first the  vessels for the libations, then the cases for the Canopic jars, then the  Canopic jars themselves, the mask of the deceased, coloured half in gold  and half in blue, arms, sceptres, military batons, necklaces, scarabs,  vultures with encircling wings worn on the breast at festival-times,  chains, \"Respondents,\" and the human-headed sparrow-hawk, the emblem of  the soul. Many of these objects were of wood plated with gold, others  of the same material simply gilt, and others of solid gold, and thus  calculated to excite the cupidity of the crowd. Offerings came next,  then a noisy company of female weepers; then a slave, who sprinkled at  every instant some milk upon the ground as if to lay the dust; then  a master of the ceremonies, who, the panther skin upon his shoulder,  asperged the crowd with perfumed water; and behind him comes the hearse.

The latter, according to custom, was made in the form of a  boat--representing the bark of Osiris, with his ark, and two guardians,  Isis and Nephthys--and was placed upon a sledge, which was drawn by a  team of oxen and a relay of fellahin. The sides of the ark were, as  a rule, formed of movable wooden panels, decorated with pictures and  inscriptions; sometimes, however, but more rarely, the panels were  replaced by a covering of embroidered stuff or of soft leather. In  the latter case the decoration was singularly rich, the figures and  hieroglyphs being cut out with a knife, and the spaces thus left filled  in with pieces of coloured leather, which gave the whole an appearance  of brilliant mosaic-work.*         * One of these coverings was found in the hiding-place at       Deir el-Bahari; it had belonged to the Princess Isimkhobiu,       whose mummy is now at Gizeh.    [Illustration: 013.jpg THE FUNERAL OF HABMHABI]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the coloured print in       Wilkinson. The left side of this design fits on to the right       of the preceding cut.    In place of a boat, a shrine of painted wood, also mounted upon a  sledge, was frequently used. When the ceremony was over, this was left,  together with the coffin, in the tomb.*         * I found in the tomb of Sonnozmu two of these sledges with       the superstructure in the form of a temple. They are now in       the Gizeh Museum.    The wife and children walked as close to the bier as possible, and  were followed by the friends of the deceased, dressed in long linen  garments,* each of them bearing a wand. The ox-driver, while goading his  beasts, cried out to them: \"To the West, ye oxen who draw the hearse,  to the West! Your master comes behind you!\" \"To the West,\" the friends  repeated; \"the excellent man lives no longer who loved truth so dearly  and hated lying!\"**         ** The whole of this description is taken from the pictures       representing the interment of a certain Harmhabi, who died       at Thebes in the time of Thfitmosis IV.         * These expressions are taken from the inscriptions on the       tomb of Rai    [Illustration: 014.jpg THE BOAT CARRYING THE MUMMY]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from pictures in the tomb of       Nofirhotpu at Thebes.    This lamentation is neither remarkable for its originality nor for its  depth of feeling. Sorrow was expressed on such occasions in prescribed  formulas of always the same import, custom soon enabling each individual  to compose for himself a repertory of monotonous exclamations of  condolence, of which the prayer, \"To the West!\" formed the basis,  relieved at intervals by some fresh epithet. The nearest relatives  of the deceased, however, would find some more sincere expressions of  grief, and some more touching appeals with which to break in upon the  commonplaces of the conventional theme. On reaching the bank of the Nile  the funeral cortege proceeded to embark.*         * The description of this second part of the funeral       arrangements is taken from the tomb of Harmhabi, and       especially from that of Nofirhotpu.

They blended with their inarticulate cries, and the usual protestations  and formulas, an eulogy upon the deceased and his virtues, allusions  to his disposition and deeds, mention of the offices and honours he had  obtained, and reflections on the uncertainty of human life--the whole  forming the melancholy dirge which each generation intoned over its  predecessor, while waiting itself for the same office to be said over it  in its turn.    The bearers of offerings, friends, and slaves passed over on hired  barges, whose cabins, covered externally with embroidered stuffs of  several colours, or with _applique_ leather, looked like the pedestals  of a monument: crammed together on the boats, they stood upright with  their faces turned towards the funeral bark. The latter was supposed to  represent the Noshemit, the mysterious skiff of Abydos, which had been  used in the obsequies of Osiris of yore.    [Illustration: 016.jpg THE BOATS CONTAINING THE FRIENDS AND THE FUNERARY  FURNITURE]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from paintings on the tomb of       Nofirhotpu at Thebes.    It was elegant, light, and slender in shape, and ornamented at bow and  stern with a lotus-flower of metal, which bent back its head gracefully,  as if bowed down by its own weight. A temple-shaped shrine stood in  the middle of the boat, adorned with bouquets of flowers and with  green palm-branches. The female members of the family of the deceased,  crouched beside the shrine, poured forth lamentations, while two  priestesses, representing respectively Isis and Nephthys, took up  positions behind to protect the body. The boat containing the female  mourners having taken the funeral barge in tow, the entire flotilla  pushed out into the stream. This was the solemn moment of the  ceremony--the moment in which the deceased, torn away from his earthly  city, was about to set out upon that voyage from which there is no  return. The crowds assembled on the banks of the river hailed the dead  with their parting prayers: \"Mayest thou reach in peace the West from  Thebes! In peace, in peace towards Abydos, mayest thou descend in peace  towards Abydos, towards the sea of the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17327"],[0,"History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 7 (of 12) (#2)"],[1,"abubaliddin, whose name is as yet unknown       to us.    His successor abandoned to the Assyrians most of the districts situated  on the left bank of the Lower Zab between the Zagros mountains and the  Tigris, and peace, which was speedily secured by a double marriage,  remained unbroken for nearly half a century. Tukulti-ninip II. was fond  of fighting; \"he overthrew his adversaries and exposed their heads upon  stakes,\" but, unlike his predecessor, he directed his efforts against  Nairi and the northern and western tribes. We possess no details of his  campaigns; we can only surmise that in six years, from 890 to 885,* he  brought into subjection the valley of the Upper Tigris and the mountain  provinces which separate it from the Assyrian plain. Having reached the  source of the river, he carved, beside the image of Tiglath-pileser I.,  the following inscription, which may still be read upon the rock. \"With  the help of Assur, Shamash, and Ramman, the gods of his religion, he  reached this spot. The lofty mountains he subjugated from the sun-rising  to its down-setting; victorious, irresistible, he came hither, and like  unto the lightning he crossed the raging rivers.\"**         * The parts preserved of the Eponym canon begin their record       in 893, about the end of the reign of Ramman-nirari IL The       line which distinguishes the two reigns from one another is       drawn between the name of the personage who corresponds to       the year 890, and that of Tukulti-ninip who corresponds to       the year 889: Tukulti-ninip II., therefore, begins his reign       in 890, and his death is six years later, in 885.         ** This inscription and its accompanying bas-relief are       mentioned in the _Annals of Assur-nazir-pal_.    He did not live long to enjoy his triumphs, but his death made no  impression on the impulse given to the fortunes of his country. The  kingdom which he left to Assur-nazir-pal, the eldest of his sons,  embraced scarcely any of the countries which had paid tribute to former  sovereigns. Besides Assyria proper, it comprised merely those districts  of Nairi which had been annexed within his own generation; the  remainder had gradually regained their liberty: first the outlying  dependencies--Cilicia, Melitene, Northern Syria, and then the provinces  nearer the capital, the valleys of the Masios and the Zagros, the  steppes of the Khabur, and even some districts such as Lubdi and  Shupria, which had been allotted to Assyrian colonists at various  times after successful campaigns. Nearly the whole empire had to be  reconquered under much the same conditions as in the first instance.  Assyria itself, it is true, had recovered the vitality and elasticity of  its earlier days. The people were a robust and energetic race, devoted  to their rulers, and ready to follow them blindly and trustingly  wherever they might lead. The army, while composed chiefly of the same  classes of troops as in the time of Tiglath-pileser I.,--spearmen,  archers, sappers, and slingers,--now possessed a new element, whose  appearance on the field of battle was to revolutionize the whole method  of warfare; this was the cavalry, properly so called, introduced as an  adjunct to the chariotry. The number of horsemen forming this contingent  was as yet small; like the infantry, they wore casques and cuirasses,  but were clothed with a tight-fitting loin-cloth in place of the  long kilt, the folds of which would have embarrassed their movements.  One-half of the men carried sword and lance, the other half sword and  bow, the latter of a smaller kind than that used by the infantry. Their  horses were bridled, and bore trappings on the forehead, but had no  saddles; their riders rode bareback without stirrups; they sat far back  with the chest thrown forward, their knees drawn up to grip the shoulder  of the animal.    [Illustration: 009.jpg AN ASSYRIAN HORSEMAN ARMED WITH THE SWORD]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief in bronze on the       gate of Balawat. The Assyrian artist has shown the head and       legs of the second horse in profile behind the first, but he       has forgotten to represent the rest of its body, and also       the man riding it.    Each horseman was attended by a groom, who rode abreast of him, and held  his reins during an action, so that he might be free to make use of  his weapons. This body of cavalry, having little confidence in its own  powers, kept in close contact with the main body of the army, and was  not used in independent manouvres; it was associated with and formed an  escort to the chariotry in expeditions where speed was essential, and  where the ordinary foot soldier would have hampered the movements of the  charioteers.*         * Isolated horsemen must no doubt have existed in the       Assyrian just as in the Egyptian army, but we never find any       mention of a _body_ of cavalry in inscriptions prior to the       time of Assur-nazir-pal; the introduction of this new corps       must consequently have taken place between the reigns of       Tiglath-pileser and Assur-nazir-pal, probably nearer the       time of the latter. Assur-nazir-pal himself seldom speaks of       his cavalry, but he constantly makes mention of the horsemen       of the Aramaean and Syrian principalities, whom he       incorporated into his own army.    [Illustration: 010.jpg A MOUNTED ASSYRIAN ARCHER WITH ATTENDANT]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bronze bas-reliefs       of the gate of Balawat.    The army thus reinforced was at all events more efficient, if not  actually more powerful, than formerly; the discipline maintained was as  severe, the military spirit as keen, the equipment as perfect, and the  tactics as skilful as in former times. A knowledge of engineering had  improved upon the former methods of taking towns by sapping and scaling,  and though the number of military engines was as yet limited, the  besiegers were well able, when occasion demanded, to improvise and make  use of machines capable of demolishing even the strongest walls.*         * The battering-ram had already reached such a degree of       perfection under Assur-nazir-pal, that it must have been       invented some time before the execution of the first bas-       reliefs on which we see it portrayed. Its points of       resemblance to the Greek battering-ram furnished Hoofer with       one of his mam arguments for placing the monuments of       Khorsabad and Koyunjik as late as the Persian or Parthian       period.    The Assyrians were familiar with all the different kinds of  battering-ram; the hand variety, which was merely a beam tipped with  iron, worked by some score of men; the fixed ram, in which the beam was  suspended from a scaffold and moved by means of ropes; and lastly,  the movable ram, running on four or six wheels, which enabled it to be  advanced or withdrawn at will. The military engineers of the day allowed  full rein to their fancy in the many curious shapes they gave to this  latter engine; for example, they gave to the mass of bronze at its point  the form of the head of an animal, and the whole engine took at times  the form of a sow ready to root up with its snout the foundations of the  enemy's defences. The scaffolding of the machine was usually protected  by a carapace of green leather or some coarse woollen material stretched  over it, which broke the force of blows from projectiles: at times it  had an additional arrangement in the shape of a cupola or turret in  which archers were stationed to sweep the face of the wall opposite to  the point of attack.    [Illustration: 012.jpg THE MOVABLE SOW MAKING A BREACH IN THE WALL OF A  FORTRESS]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from one of the bronze bas-reliefs       of the gate of Balawat.    The battering-rams were set up and placed in line at a short distance  from the ramparts of the besieged town; the ground in front of them was  then levelled and a regular causeway constructed, which was paved with  bricks wherever the soil appeared to be lacking in firmness. These  preliminaries accomplished, the engines were pushed forward by relays  of troops till they reached the required range. The effort needed to set  the ram in motion severely taxed the strength of those engaged in the  work; for the size of the beam was enormous, and its iron point, or the  square mass of metal at the end, was of no light weight. The besieged  did their best to cripple or, if possible, destroy the engine as it  approached them.    [Illustration: 013.jpg THE TURRETED BATTERING-RAM ATTACKING THE WALLS OF  A TOWN]         Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief brought from       Nimroud, now in the British Museum.    Torches, lighted tow, burning pitch, and stink-pots were hurled down  upon its roofing: attempts were made to seize the head of the ram by  means of chains or hooks, so as to prevent it from moving, or in order  to drag it on to the battlements; in some cases the garrison succeeded  in crushing the machinery with a mass of rock. The Assyrians, however,  did not allow themselves to be discouraged by such trifling accidents;  they would at once extinguish the fire, release, by sheer force of  muscle, the beams which the enemy had secured, and if, notwithstanding  all their efforts, one of the machines became injured, they had others  ready to take its place, and the ram would be again at work after only a  few minutes' delay. Walls, even when of burnt brick or faced with small  stones, stood no chance against such an attack.

The first blow of the ram sufficed to shake them, and an opening was  rapidly made, so that in a few days, often in a few hours, they became  a heap of ruins; the foot soldiers could then enter by the breach "]]]
