[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18269"],[0,"Pascal's Pens√©es (#2)"],[1,"school of casuistry which relaxed the requirements  of the Confessional; a school which certainly flourished amongst the  Society of Jesus at that time, and of which the Spaniards Escobar and  Molina are the most eminent authorities. He undoubtedly abused the art  of quotation, as a polemical writer can hardly help but do; but there  were abuses for him to abuse; and he did the job thoroughly. His  _Letters_ must not be called theology. Academic theology was not a  department in which Pascal was versed; when necessary, the fathers of  Port-Royal came to his aid. The _Letters_ are the work of one of the  finest mathematical minds of any time, and of a man of the world who  addressed, not theologians, but the world in general--all of the  cultivated and many of the less cultivated of the French laity; and with  this public they made an astonishing success.    During this time Pascal never wholly abandoned his scientific interests.  Though in his religious writings he composed slowly and painfully, and  revised often, in matters of mathematics his mind seemed to move with  consummate natural ease and grace. Discoveries and inventions sprang  from his brain without effort; among the minor devices of this later  period, the first omnibus service in Paris is said to owe its origin to  his inventiveness. But rapidly failing health, and absorption in the  great work he had in mind, left him little time and energy during the  last two years of his life.    The plan of what we call the _Pensees_ formed itself about 1660. The  completed book was to have been a carefully constructed defence of  Christianity, a true Apology and a kind of Grammar of Assent, setting  forth the reasons which will convince the intellect. As I have indicated  before, Pascal was not a theologian, and on dogmatic theology had  recourse to his spiritual advisers. Nor was he indeed a systematic  philosopher. He was a man with an immense genius for science, and at the  same time a natural psychologist and moralist. As he was a great  literary artist, his book would have been also his own spiritual  autobiography; his style, free from all diminishing idiosyncrasies, was  yet very personal. Above all, he was a man of strong passions; and his  intellectual passion for truth was reinforced by his passionate  dissatisfaction with human life unless a spiritual explanation could be  found.    We must regard the _Pensees_ as merely the first notes for a work which  he left far from completion; we have, in Sainte-Beuve's words, a tower  of which the stones have been laid on each other, but not cemented, and  the structure unfinished. In early years his memory had been amazingly  retentive of anything that he wished to remember; and had it not been  impaired by increasing illness and pain, he probably would not have been  obliged to set down these notes at all. But taking the book as it is  left to us, we still find that it occupies a unique place in the history  of French literature and in the history of religious meditation.    To understand the method which Pascal employs, the reader must be  prepared to follow the process of the mind of the intelligent believer.  The Christian thinker--and I mean the man who is trying consciously and  conscientiously to explain to himself the sequence which culminated in  faith, rather than the public apologist--proceeds by rejection and  elimination. He finds the world to be so and so; he finds its character  inexplicable by any non-religious theory; among religions he finds  Christianity, and Catholic Christianity, to account most satisfactorily  for the world and especially for the moral world within; and thus, by  what Newman calls \"powerful and concurrent\" reasons, he finds himself  inexorably committed to the dogma of the Incarnation. To the unbeliever,  this method seems disingenuous and perverse; for the unbeliever is, as a  rule, not so greatly troubled to explain the world to himself, nor so  greatly distressed by its disorder; nor is he generally concerned (in  modern terms) to \"preserve values.\" He does not consider that if certain  emotional states, certain developments of character, and what in the  highest sense can be called \"saintliness\" are inherently and by  inspection known to be good, then the satisfactory explanation of the  world must be an explanation which will admit the \"reality\" of these  values. Nor does he consider such reasoning admissible; he would, so to  speak, trim his values according to his cloth, because to him such  values are of no great value. The unbeliever starts from the other end,  and as likely as not with the question: Is a case of human  parthenogenesis credible? and this he would call going straight to the  heart of the matter. Now Pascal's method is, on the whole, the method  natural and right for the Christian; and the opposite method is that  taken by Voltaire. It is worth while to remember that Voltaire, in his  attempt to refute Pascal, has given once and for all the type of such  refutation; and that later opponents of Pascal's Apology for the  Christian Faith have contributed little beyond psychological  irrelevancies. For Voltaire has presented, better than any one since,  what is the unbelieving point of view; and in the end we must all choose  for ourselves between one point of view and another.    I have said above that Pascal's method is \"on the whole\" that of the  typical Christian apologist; and this reservation was directed at  Pascal's belief in miracles, which plays a larger part in his  construction than it would in that, at least, of the modern liberal  Catholic. It would seem fantastic to accept Christianity because we  first believe the Gospel miracles to be true, and it would seem impious  to accept it primarily because we believe more recent miracles to be  true; we accept the miracles, or some miracles, to be true because we  believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ: we found our belief in the miracles  on the Gospel, not our belief in the Gospel on the miracles. But it must  be remembered that Pascal had been deeply impressed by a contemporary  miracle, known as the miracle of the Holy Thorn: a thorn reputed to have  been preserved from the Crown of Our Lord was pressed upon an ulcer  which quickly healed. Sainte-Beuve, who as a medical man felt himself on  solid ground, discusses fully the possible explanation of this apparent  miracle. It is true that the miracle happened at Port-Royal, and that it  arrived opportunely to revive the depressed spirits of the community in  its political afflictions; and it is likely that Pascal was the more  inclined to believe a miracle which was performed upon his beloved  sister. In any case, it probably led him to assign a place to miracles,  in his study of faith, which is not quite that which we should give to  them ourselves.    Now the great adversary against whom Pascal set himself, from the time  of his first conversations with M. de Saci at Port-Royal, was Montaigne.  One cannot destroy Pascal, certainly; but of all authors Montaigne is  one of the least destructible. You could as well dissipate a fog by  flinging hand-grenades into it. For Montaigne is a fog, a gas, a fluid,  insidious element. He does not reason, he insinuates, charms, and  influences; or if he reasons, you must be prepared for his having some  other design upon you than to convince you by his argument. It is  hardly too much to say that Montaigne is the most essential author to  know, if we would understand the course of French thought during the  last three hundred years. In every way, the influence of Montaigne was  repugnant to the men of Port-Royal. Pascal studied him with the  intention of demolishing him. Yet, in the _Pensees_, at the very end of  his life, we find passage after passage, and the slighter they are the  more significant, almost \"lifted\" out of Montaigne, down to a figure of  speech or a word. The parallels[A] are most often with the long essay of  Montaigne called _Apologie de Raymond Sebond_--an astonishing piece of  writing upon which Shakespeare also probably drew in _Hamlet_. Indeed,  by the time a man knew Montaigne well enough to attack him, he would  already be thoroughly infected by him.        [A] Cf. the use of the simile of the _couvreur_. For comparing      parallel passages, the edition of the _Pensees_ by Henri Massis (_A      la cite des livres_) is better than the two-volume edition of      Jacques Chevalier (Gabalda). It seems just possible that in the      latter edition, and also in his biographical study (_Pascal_; by      Jacques Chevalier, English translation, published by Sheed & Ward),      M. Chevalier is a little over-zealous to demonstrate the perfect      orthodoxy of Pascal.    It would, however, be grossly unfair to Pascal, to Montaigne, and indeed  to French literature, to leave the matter at that. It is no diminution  of Pascal, but only an aggrandisement of Montaigne. Had Montaigne been  an ordinary life-sized sceptic, a small man like Anatole France, or even  a greater man like Renan, or even like the greatest sceptic of all,  Voltaire, this \"influence\" would be to the discredit of Pascal; but if  Montaigne had been no more than Voltaire, he could not have affected  Pascal at all. The picture of Montaigne which offers itself first to our  eyes, that of the original and independent solitary \"personality,\"  absorbed in amused analysis of himself, is deceptive. Montaigne's is no  _limited_ Pyrrhonism, like that of Voltaire, Renan, or France. He  exists, so to speak, on a plan of numerous concentric circles, the most  apparent of which is the small inmost circle, a personal puckish  scepticism which can be easily aped if not imitated. But what makes  Montaigne a very great figure is that he succeeded, God knows how--for  Montaigne very likely did not know that he had done it--it is not the  sort of thing that men _can_ observe about themselves, for it is  essentially bigger than the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18273"],[0,"The Wild Tribes of Davao District, Mindanao (#2)"],[1,"of active erosion for a long period of time. If  these mountain chains and river courses are followed back it is found  that they all radiate from one stupendous mass, the center of which is  Mt. Apo, the highest mountain in the Philippines and reputed to be an  active volcano. Near to its summit is a deep fissure from which, on  clear mornings, columns of smoke or steam can be seen ascending, while  the first rays of the rising sun turn into gold, or sheets of white, the  fields of sulphur which surround the cone.    Along the lower eastern and southern slopes of this mountain and its  tributary peaks live the wilder branch of this tribe, whose traditions,  religious observances, and daily life are closely related to the  manifestations of latent energy in the old volcano.    NUMBER.    The exact number who fall under this classification is not known,  Governor Bolton, who was intimately acquainted with the wild tribes of  the District, estimated their number at sixty-five hundred, but this  count did not include the sub-division here given as Obo. One  enumeration, made by a Jesuit missionary, places the population at  fifteen thousand, while the Government report of 1900 gives them  eighteen thousand four hundred. The latter estimates are certainly  excessive. It is probable that they were determined by compiling the  population of villages reported to exist in the interior.    The wilder members of this tribe are, to a certain extent, migratory,  moving their villages from one location to another according to the  demands of their mode of agriculture. Their rice fields are made in  mountain-side clearings, and as the ever present cogon grass[1] begins  to invade the open land they substitute sweet potatoes or hemp. In time  even these lusty plants give way to the rank grass, and the people find  it easier to make new clearings in the forest than to combat the pest  with the primitive tools at their command. This results in some new  fields each year, and when these are at too great a distance from the  dwellings the old settlements are abandoned and new ones formed at more  convenient locations.    [1] _Imperata koenigii_.    It is probable that the total number belonging to this tribe does not  exceed ten thousand persons.    INFLUENCE OF NEIGHBORS:--HISTORY.    The influence of the neighboring tribes and of the white man on the  Bagobo has been considerable. The desire for women, slaves, and loot, as  well as the eagerness of individual warriors for distinction, has caused  many hostile raids to be made against neighboring tribes. Similar  motives have led others to attack them and thus there has been, through  a long period, a certain exchange of blood, customs, and artifacts.  Peaceful exchange of commodities has also been carried on for many years  along the borders of their territory. With the advent of the Moro along  the sea coast a brisk trade was opened up and new industries introduced.  There seems to have been little, if any, intermarriage between these  people, but their relations were sufficiently close for the Moro to  exert a marked influence on the religious and civil life of the wilder  tribe, and to cause them to incorporate into their language many new  words and terms.    The friendly relations with the Moro seem to have been broken off upon  the arrival and settlement of the Spaniards in Davao. The newcomers were  then at war with the followers of Mohammed and soon succeeded in  enlisting the Bagobo rulers in their cause. A Chinese plate decorated  with the picture of a large blue fish was offered for each Moro head the  tribesmen presented to the Spanish commander. The desire for these  trophies was sufficient soon to start a brisk trade in heads, to judge  from the number of these plates still to be seen among the prized  objects of the petty rulers.    After the overthrow of Moro power on the coast, Jesuit missionaries  began their labors among the Bagobo, and later established their  followers in several villages. In 1886 Father Gisbert reported eight  hundred converts living in five coast towns. Following the conflict  between Spain and the United States, and during the subsequent  insurrection, these villages were left without protection or guidance.  As a result, large numbers of the inhabitants retired to the hills where  they were again merged with their wilder brothers. Naturally, they  carried with them new ideas as well as material objects. With the  re-establishment of order under American rule many returned to the  deserted villages while others were induced by Governor Bolton to form  compact settlements midway between the coast and the mountain  fastnesses. The influence of the Government has become stronger each  year, and following the human sacrifice at Talun in 1907, that powerful  village and several of the neighboring settlements were compelled to  move down near to the sea where they could be more easily controlled.    Schools have been opened in some localities and these, together with the  activities of Catholic and Protestant missionaries, are causing a rapid  change in the life and beliefs of the tribe.    The presence of American hemp planters, with the consequent demand for  laborers, is also proving an immense factor in wiping out old tribal  lines and in introducing new ideas.    Beyond a few letters written by the missionaries[2] we find scant  reference to this tribe in history, but their own traditions and  genealogies are well known even by the younger generation.    [2] BLAIR and ROBERTSON. The Philippine Islands.    According to the tribal historians the human race sprang from a man,  Toglai, and his wife, Toglibon, who lived on Mt. Apo.[3] \"They were  there from the beginning, at a point near to the present settlement of  Cibolan. Many fruits grew on the mountains and the forests abounded in  game so that it was easy for them to secure food. There were born to  them children, who, when they grew up, married. One day Toglai and  Toglibon told their oldest boy and girl that they should go far away  across the ocean, for there was a good place for them. So the two  departed and were seen no more until their descendants, the white  people, came back to Davao. The other children remained with their  parents and were happy and prosperous until Toglai and Toglibon died and  went to the sky, where they became spirits. Soon after their death the  country suffered a great drought. This finally became so severe that the  water in the rivers dried up and there was no more food in the land. At  last the children were forced to leave their home and seek out new  habitations in other parts. They traveled in pairs, in different  directions, until they came to favorable locations where they settled  down. From them have sprung all the tribes known to the Bagobo. One pair  was too weak to make the journey from the drought-cursed land, and staid  at Cibolan. One day the man crawled out into the ruined fields to see if  he could not find some one thing alive, and when he arrived there he  saw, to his amazement, a single stalk of sugar cane growing lustily. He  cut it with his knife, and water began to come out until there was  enough for the couple to drink. The flow did not cease until the rains  came again to refresh the land. From these two the tribe has again grown  until it numbers its members in the thousands. The people have remained  true to their belief in the spirits, and each year has found them  stronger in numbers, and richer in houses, land, and slaves.\"    [3] See fuller account by author, in _Philippine Journal of Science_.  June 1911, Vol. VI, No. 3, pp. 128-9.    The genealogy of the Bagobo rulers is traced back through ten  generations. The first ruler of whom there is record was Salingolop,  during whose reign, it seems, the Spaniards first came to the  Philippines. According to the tale[4] \"Salingolop was a man of great and  prodigious force, and as tall as the Lauan, which is the tallest tree in  these forests. He had three sons called Bato, Sipongos, and Calisquisan,  and a daughter named Panugutan. When the Spaniards arrived at Manila,  and found that there existed a man so tall and powerful, they sent a  battalion of soldiers. They disembarked on the shore of Bimigao near  Daron, and ascended the mountain where Salingolop lived. He was not  found, because at the time he was on the other side of the mountain  hunting wild boars, and the soldiers returned to the shore, taking  Panugutan as a hostage. Salingolop, having found out what had happened  descended the mountain alone to fight the soldiers which were there.  These fired on him, but in vain, because the balls could make no  impression. On seeing this, they dropped their rifles and with bars of  iron they struck him on the legs, trying to overthrow him. As he fell on  the side towards the sea, the noise of the waves, it is said, reached to  the Cape of San Augustin. They cut off his head and, as he lay dead,  they cut off his legs that he might not arise again. The Spaniards  returned to Manila, taking with them Panugutan; she married in Manila a  Spaniard, by whom she had two children, who later returned to these  parts and were well received, being considered not only as friends but  as brothers of the Bagobo.\"    [4] Recorded by P. Juan Doyle, S. J.    Salingolop was succeeded by his son Bato who, in turn, was followed by  Boas, Basian, Lumbay, Banga, Maliadi, and Taopan. Until we come to this  last mentioned ruler we learn little more of importance, but at the  beginning of his rule, we learn that the Bagobo had become a powerful  people. Under his leadership they made frequent forays into neighboring  districts and returned with many slaves and rich loot. The _datu_[5] was  noted as a brave warrior, but in addition to this he was a wise and just  ruler, greatly beloved by all his people. When he died more than one  thousand of his subjects attended the funeral which lasted"]]]
