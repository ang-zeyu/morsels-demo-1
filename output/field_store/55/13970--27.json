(#2)"],[1," that though the bigotry  or ambition of Henry or Philip might incline them to execute a sentence  of excommunication against her, their interests were so incompatible,  that they never could concur in any plan of operations; and the enmity  of the one would always insure to her the friendship of the other:  that if they encouraged the discontents of her Catholic subjects,  their dominions also abounded with Protestants, and it would be easy to  retaliate upon them: that even such of the English as seemed at present  zealously attached to the Catholic faith, would, most of them, embrace  the religion of their new sovereign; and the nation had of late been  so much accustomed to these revolutions, that men had lost all idea of  truth and falsehood in such subjects: that the authority of Henry VIII.,  so highly raised by many concurring circumstances, first inured the  people to this submissive deference; and it was the less difficult for  succeeding princes to continue the nation in a track to which it had so  long been accustomed; and that it would be easy for her, by bestowing on  Protestants all preferment in civil offices and the militia, the church  and the universities, both to insure her own authority, and to render  her religion entirely predominant.[*]    The education of Elizabeth, as well as her interest, led her to favor  the reformation; and she remained not long in suspense with regard to  the party which she should embrace. But though determined in her own  mind, she resolved to proceed by gradual and secure steps, and not to  imitate the example of Mary in encouraging the bigots of her party to  make immediately a violent invasion on the established religion.[**]  She thought it requisite, however, to discover such symptoms of her  intentions as might give encouragement to the Protestants so much  depressed by the late violent persecutions. She immediately recalled  all the exiles, and gave liberty to the prisoners who were confined on  account of religion. We are told of a pleasantry of one Rainsford on  this occasion, who said to the queen, that he had a petition to present  her in behalf of other prisoners called Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John:  she readily replied, that it behoved her first to consult the prisoners  themselves, and to learn of them whether they desired that liberty which  he demanded for them.[***]         * Burnet, vol. ii. p. 377. Camden, p. 370.         ** Burnet, vol. ii. p. 378. Camden, p. 371.         *** Heylin, p. 103.    Elizabeth also proceeded to exert in favor of the reformers some acts  of power which were authorized by the extent of royal prerogative  during that age. Finding that the Protestant teachers, irritated by  persecution, broke out in a furious attack on the ancient superstition,  and that the Romanists replied with no less zeal and acrimony, she  published a proclamation, by which she inhibited all preaching without a  special license;[*] and though she dispensed with these orders in favor  of some preachers of her own sect, she took care that they should be the  most calm and moderate of the party. She also suspended the laws so far  as to order a great part of the service; the litany, the Lord's prayer,  the creed, and the gospels; to be read in English. And having first  published injunctions, that all the churches should conform themselves  to the practice of her own chapel, she forbade the host to be any more  elevated in her presence; an innovation which, however frivolous it may  appear, implied the most material consequences.[**]    These declarations of her intention, concurring with preceding  suspicions, made the bishops foresee with certainty a revolution in  religion. They therefore refused to officiate at her coronation; and  it was with some difficulty that the bishop of Carlisle was at last  prevailed on to perform the ceremony. When she was conducted through  London, amidst the joyful acclamations of her subjects, a boy, who  personated truth, was let down from one of the triumphal arches, and  presented to her a copy of the Bible. She received the book with the  most gracious deportment; placed it next her bosom; and declared that,  amidst all the costly testimonies which the city had that day given her  of their attachment, this present was by far the most precious and  most acceptable.[*] Such were the innocent artifices by which Elizabeth  insinuated herself into the affections of her subjects. Open in her  address, gracious and affable in all public appearances, she rejoiced  in the concourse of her subjects, entered into all their pleasures and  amusements; and without departing from her dignity, which she knew  well how to preserve, she acquired a popularity beyond what any of her  predecessors or successors ever could attain. Her own sex exulted to see  a woman hold the reins of empire with such prudence and fortitude: and  while a young princess of twenty-five years, (for that was her age at  her accession,) who possessed all the graces and insinuation, though not  all the beauty of her sex, courted the affections of individuals by  her civilities, of the public by her services; her authority though  corroborated by the strictest bands of law and religion, appeared to be  derived entirely from the choice and inclination of the people.         * Heylin, p. 104. Strype, vol. i. p. 41.         ** Camden, p. 371. Heylin, p. 104. Strype, vol. i. p 54.       Stowe, p. 635.         *** Burnet, vol. ii. p. 380. Strype, vol. i. p. 29.    A sovereign of this disposition was not likely to offend her subjects  by any useless or violent exertions of power; and Elizabeth, though she  threw out such hints as encouraged the Protestants delayed the entire  change of religion till the meeting of the parliament, which was  summoned to assemble. The elections had gone entirely against the  Catholics, who seem not indeed to have made any great struggle for the  superiority;[*] and the houses met in a disposition of gratifying the  queen in every particular which she could desire of them. They began  the session with a unanimous declaration, \"that Queen Elizabeth was, and  ought to be, as well by the word of God, as the common and statute  laws of the realm, the lawful, undoubted, and true heir to the crown,  lawfully descended from the blood royal, according to the order of  succession settled in the thirty-fifth of Henry VIII.\"[**]         * Notwithstanding the bias of the nation towards the       Protestant sect, it appears that some violence, at least       according to our present ideas, was used in these elections:       five candidates were nominated by the court to each borough,       and three to each county; and by the sheriff's authority the       members were chosen from among these candidates. See state       papers collected by Edward, earl of Clarendon, p. 92.         * I Eliz. cap. 3.    This act of recognition was probably dictated by the queen herself and  her ministers; and she showed her magnanimity, as well as moderation, in  the terms which she employed on that occasion. She followed not Mary's  practice in declaring the validity of her mother's marriage, or in  expressly repealing the act formerly made against her own legitimacy:  she knew that this attempt must be attended with reflections on her  father's memory, and on the birth of her deceased sister; and as all the  world was sensible, that Henry's divorce from Anne Boleyn was merely the  effect of his usual violence and caprice, she scorned to found her title  on any act of an assembly which had too much prostituted its authority  by its former variable, servile, and iniquitous decisions. Satisfied,  therefore, in the general opinion entertained with regard to this fact,  which appeared the more undoubted, the less anxiety she discovered in  fortifying it by votes and inquiries; she took possession of the  throne both as her birthright, and as insured to her by former acts  of parliament; and she never appeared anxious to distinguish these  titles.[*]    The first bill brought into parliament with a view of trying their  disposition on the head of religion, was that for suppressing  the monasteries lately erected, and for restoring the tenths and  first-fruits to the queen. This point being gained without much  difficulty, a bill was next introduced, annexing the supremacy to the  crown; and though the queen was there denominated \"governess,\" not  \"head,\" of the church, it conveyed the same extensive power which under  the latter title had been exercised by her father and brother. All the  bishops who were present in the upper house strenuously opposed this  law; and as they possessed more learning than the temporal peers, they  triumphed in the debate; but the majority of voices in that house, as  well as among the commons, was against them. By this act, the crown,  without the concurrence either of the parliament, or even of the  convocation, was vested with the whole spiritual power; might repress  all heresies, might establish or repeal all canons, might alter every  point of discipline, and might ordain or abolish any religious rite or  ceremony,[**]         * Camden, p. 372. Heylin, p. 107, 108         ** I Eliz. cap. 1. This last power was anew recognized in       the bill of uniformity I Eliz. cap 2.    In determining heresy, the sovereign was only limited (if that could be  called a limitation) to such doctrines as had been adjudged heresy by  the authority of the Scripture, by the first four general councils, or  by any general council which followed the Scripture as their rule, or  to such other doctrines as should hereafter be denominated heresy by  the parliament and convocation. In order to exercise this authority,  the queen, by a clause of the act, was empowered to name commissioners,  either laymen or clergymen, as she should think proper; and on this  clause was afterwards founded the court of ecclesiastical commission;  which assumed large"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19215"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part E.

Animated with a warm regard to liberty, these generous patriots  saw with regret an unbounded power exercised by the crown, and were  resolved to seize the opportunity which the king's necessities offered  them, of reducing the prerogative within more reasonable compass.  Though their ancestors had blindly given way to practices and precedents  favorable to kingly power, and had been able, notwithstanding, to  preserve some small remains of liberty, it would be impossible, they  thought, when all these pretensions were methodised, and prosecuted by  the increasing knowledge of the age, to maintain any shadow of popular  government, in opposition to such unlimited authority in the sovereign.  It was necessary to fix a choice; either to abandon entirely the  privileges of the people, or to secure them by firmer and more precise  barriers than the constitution had hitherto provided for them. In this  dilemma, men of such aspiring geniuses, and such independent fortunes,  could not long deliberate: they boldly embraced the side of freedom,  and resolved to grant no supplies to their necessitous prince, without  extorting concessions in favor of civil liberty. The end they esteemed  beneficent and noble; the means, regular and constitutional. To grant or  refuse supplies was the undoubted privilege of the commons. And as all  human governments, particularly those of a mixed frame, are in continual  fluctuation, it was as natural, in their opinion, and allowable, for  popular assemblies to take advantage of favorable incidents, in order  to secure the subject, as for monarchs, in order to extend their own  authority. With pleasure they beheld the king involved in a foreign war,  which rendered him every day more dependent on the parliament; while at  the same time the situation of the kingdom, even without any military  preparations, gave it sufficient security against all invasion from  foreigners. Perhaps, too, it had partly proceeded from expectations of  this nature, that the popular leaders had been so urgent for a rupture  with Spain; nor is it credible, that religious zeal could so far have  blinded all of them, as to make them discover, in such a measure, any  appearance of necessity, or any hopes of success.    But, however natural all these sentiments might appear to the country  party, it is not to be imagined that Charles would entertain the same  ideas. Strongly prejudiced in favor of the duke, whom he had heard so  highly extolled in parliament, he could not conjecture the cause of  so sudden an alteration in their opinions. And when the war which  they themselves had so earnestly solicited, was at last commenced,  the immediate desertion of their sovereign could not but seem very  unaccountable. Even though no further motive had been suspected, the  refusal of supply in such circumstances would naturally to him appear  cruel and deceitful: but when he perceived that this measure proceeded  from an intention of encroaching on his authority, he failed not to  regard these aims as highly criminal and traitorous. Those lofty ideas  of monarchical power which were very commonly adopted during that age,  and to which the ambiguous nature of the English constitution gave so  plausible an appearance, were firmly rivetted in Charles; and however  moderate his temper, the natural and unavoidable prepossessions  of self-love, joined to the late uniform precedents in favor of  prerogative, had made him regard his political tenets as certain  and uncontroverted. Taught to consider even the ancient laws and  constitution more as lines to direct his conduct, than barriers to  withstand his power; a conspiracy to erect new ramparts, in order  to straiten his authority, appeared but one degree removed from open  sedition and rebellion. So atrocious in his eyes was such a design, that  he seems even unwilling to impute it to the commons; and though he was  constrained to adjourn the parliament by reason of the plague, which at  that time raged in London, he immediately reassembled them at Oxford,  and made a new attempt to gain from them some supplies in such an urgent  necessity.    Charles now found himself obliged to depart from that delicacy which he  had formerly maintained. By himself or his ministers he entered into a  particular detail, both of the alliances which he had formed, and of the  military operations which he had projected.[*]         * Dugdale, p. 25, 26.    He told the parliament, that, by a promise of subsidies, he had engaged  the king of Denmark to take part in the war; that this monarch intended  to enter Germany by the north, and to rouse to arms those princes who  impatiently longed for an opportunity of asserting the liberty of the  empire; that Mansfeldt had undertaken to penetrate with an English army  into the Palatinate, and by that quarter to excite the members of the  evangelical unions that the states must be supported in the unequal  warfare which they maintained with Spain; that no less a sum than seven  hundred thousand pounds a year had been found, by computation, requisite  for all these purposes; that the maintenance of the fleet, and the  defence of Ireland, demanded an annual expense of four hundred thousand  pounds; that he himself had already exhausted and anticipated, in the  public service, his whole revenue, and had scarcely left sufficient  for the daily subsistence of himself and his family;[*] that on his  accession to the crown, he found a debt of above three hundred thousand  pounds, contracted by his father in support of the palatine; and that  while prince of Wales, he had himself contracted debts, notwithstanding  his great frugality, to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which he  had expended entirely on naval and military armaments. After mentioning  all these facts, the king even condescended to use entreaties. He said,  that this request was the first that he had ever made them: that he was  young, and in the commencement of his reign; and if he now met with kind  and dutiful usage, it would endear to him the use of parliaments, and  would forever preserve an entire harmony between him and his people.[**]    To these reasons the commons remained inexorable. Notwithstanding that  the king's measures, on the supposition of a foreign war, which they had  constantly demanded, were altogether unexceptionable, they obstinately  refused any further aid. Some members, favorable to the court, having  insisted on an addition of two fifteenths to the former supply, even  this pittance was refused;[***] though it was known that a fleet and  army were lying at Portsmouth, in great want of pay and provisions;  and that Buckingham, the admiral, and the treasurer of the navy, had  advanced on their own credit near a hundred thousand pounds for the sea  service.[****]         * Parl.

Hist. vol. vi. p. 390.    Besides all their other motives, the house of commons had made a  discovery, which, as they wanted but a pretence for their refusal,  inflamed them against the court and against the duke of Buckingham. When  James deserted the Spanish alliance, and courted that of France, he had  promised to furnish Lewis, who was entirely destitute of naval force,  with one ship of war, together with seven armed vessels hired from  the merchants. These the French court had pretended they would employ  against the Genoese, who, being firm and useful allies to the Spanish  monarchy, were naturally regarded with an evil eye, both by the king of  France and of England. When these vessels, by Charles's orders, arrived  at Dieppe, there arose a strong suspicion that they were to serve  against Rochelle. The sailors were inflamed. That race of men, who are  at present both careless and ignorant in all matters of religion, were  at that time only ignorant. They drew up a remonstrance to Pennington,  their commander, and signing all their names in a circle, lest he should  discover the ringleaders, they laid it under his prayer-book. Pennington  declared that he would rather be hanged in England for disobedience,  than fight against his brother Protestants in France. The whole squadron  sailed immediately to the Downs. There they received new orders from  Buckingham, lord admiral, to return to Dieppe. As the duke knew that  authority alone would not suffice, he employed much art and many  subtleties to engage them to obedience; and a rumor which was spread,  that peace had been concluded between the French king and the Hugonots,  assisted him in his purpose. When they arrived at Dieppe, they found  that they had been deceived. Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who commanded one of  the vessels, broke through and returned to England. All the officers and  sailors of all the other ships, notwithstanding great offers made them  by the French, immediately deserted. One gunner alone preferred duty  towards his king to the cause of religion; and he was afterwards killed  in charging a cannon before Rochelle.[*] The care which historians have  taken to record this frivolous event, proves with what pleasure the news  was received by the nation.         * Franklyn, p. 09. Rush. vol. i. p. 175, 176, etc., 325,       326, etc.    The house of commons, when informed of these transactions, showed the  same attachment with the sailors for the Protestant religion; nor was  their zeal much better guided by reason and sound policy. It was not  considered that it was highly probable the king and the duke themselves  had here been deceived by the artifices of France, nor had they any  hostile intention against the Hugonots; that, were it otherwise yet  might their measures be justified by the most obvious and most received  maxims of civil policy; "]]]
