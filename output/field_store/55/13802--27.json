I doubt if Berlioz would have obtained any consideration at  all from lovers of classical music in France if he had not found allies  in that country of classical music, Germany--\"the oracle of Delphi,\"  \"Germania alma parens,\"[2] as he called her. Some of the young German  school found inspiration in Berlioz. The dramatic symphony that he  created flourished in its German form under Liszt; the most eminent  German composer of to-day, Richard Strauss, came under his influence;  and Felix Weingartner, who with Charles Malherbe edited Berlioz's  complete works, was bold enough to write, \"In spite of Wagner and Liszt,  we should not be where we are if Berlioz had not lived.\" This unexpected  support, coming from a country of traditions, has thrown the partisans  of Classic tradition into confusion, and rallied Berlioz's friends.    [Footnote 2: _Memoires_, II, 149.]    But here is a new danger. Though it is natural that Germany, more  musical than France, should recognise the grandeur and originality of  Berlioz's music before France, it is doubtful whether the German nature  could ever fully understand a soul so French in its essence. It is,  perhaps, what is exterior in Berlioz, his positive originality, that the  Germans appreciate. They prefer the _Requiem_ to _Romeo_. A Richard  Strauss would be attracted by an almost insignificant work like the  _Ouverture du roi Lear_; a Weingartner would single out for notice  works like the _Symphonic fantastique_ and _Harold_, and exaggerate  their importance. But they do not feel what is intimate in him. Wagner  said over the tomb of Weber, \"England does you justice, France admires  you, but only Germany loves you; you are of her own being, a glorious  day of her life, a warm drop of her blood, a part of her heart....\" One  might adapt his words to Berlioz; it is as difficult for a German really  to love Berlioz as it is for a Frenchman to love Wagner or Weber. One  must, therefore, be careful about accepting unreservedly the judgment of  Germany on Berlioz; for in that would lie the danger of a new  misunderstanding. You see how both the followers and opponents of  Berlioz hinder us from getting at the truth. Let us dismiss them.    Have we now come to the end of our difficulties? Not yet; for Berlioz is  the most illusive of men, and no one has helped more than he to mislead  people in their estimate of him. We know how much he has written about  music and about his own life, and what wit and understanding he shows in  his shrewd criticisms and charming _Memoires_.[3]    [Footnote 3: The literary work of Berlioz is rather uneven. Beside  passages of exquisite beauty we find others that are ridiculous in their  exaggerated sentiment, and there are some that even lack good taste. But  he had a natural gift of style, and his writing is vigorous, and full of  feeling, especially towards the latter half of his life. The _Procession  des Rogations_ is often quoted from the _Memoires_; and some of his  poetical text, particularly that in _L'Enfance du Christ_ and in _Les  Troyens_, is written in beautiful language and with a fine sense of  rhythm. His _Memoires_ as a whole is one of the most delightful books  ever written by an artist. Wagner was a greater poet, but as a prose  writer Berlioz is infinitely superior. See Paul Morillot's essay on  _Berlioz ecrivain_, 1903, Grenoble.] One would think that such an  imaginative and skilful writer, accustomed in his profession of critic  to express every shade of feeling, would be able to tell us more exactly  his ideas of art than a Beethoven or a Mozart. But it is not so. As too  much light may blind the vision, so too much intellect may hinder the  understanding. Berlioz's mind spent itself in details; it reflected  light from too many facets, and did not focus itself in one strong beam  which would have made known his power. He did not know how to dominate  either his life or his work; he did not even try to dominate them. He  was the incarnation of romantic genius, an unrestrained force,  unconscious of the road he trod. I would not go so far as to say that he  did not understand himself, but there are certainly times when he is  past understanding himself. He allows himself to drift where chance will  take him,[4] like an old Scandinavian pirate laid at the bottom of his  boat, staring up at the sky; and he dreams and groans and laughs and  gives himself up to his feverish delusions. He lived with his emotions  as uncertainly as he lived with his art. In his music, as in his  criticisms of music, he often contradicts himself, hesitates, and turns  back; he is not sure either of his feelings or his thoughts. He has  poetry in his soul, and strives to write operas; but his admiration  wavers between Gluck and Meyerbeer. He has a popular genius, but  despises the people. He is a daring musical revolutionary, but he  allows the control of this musical movement to be taken from him by  anyone who wishes to have it. Worse than that: he disowns the movement,  turns his back upon the future, and throws himself again into the past.  For what reason? Very often he does not know. Passion, bitterness,  caprice, wounded pride--these have more influence with him than the  serious things of life. He is a man at war with himself.    [Footnote 4: \"Chance, that unknown god, who plays such a great part in  my life\" (_Memoires_, II, 161).]    Then contrast Berlioz with Wagner. Wagner, too, was stirred by violent  passions, but he was always master of himself, and his reason remained  unshaken by the storms of his heart or those of the world, by the  torments of love or the strife of political revolutions. He made his  experiences and even his errors serve his art; he wrote about his  theories before he put them into practice; and he only launched out when  he was sure of himself, and when the way lay clear before him. And think  how much Wagner owes to this written expression of his aims and the  magnetic attraction of his arguments. It was his prose works that  fascinated the King of Bavaria before he had heard his music; and for  many others also they have been the key to that music. I remember being  impressed by Wagner's ideas when I only half understood his art; and  when one of his compositions puzzled me, my confidence was not shaken,  for I was sure that the genius who was so convincing in his reasoning  would not blunder; and that if his music baffled me, it was I who was at  fault. Wagner was really his own best friend, his own most trusty  champion; and his was the guiding hand that led one through the thick  forest and over the rugged crags of his work.    Not only do you get no help from Berlioz in this way, but he is the  first to lead you astray and wander with you in the paths of error. To  understand his genius you must seize hold of it unaided. His genius was  really great, but, as I shall try to show you, it lay at the mercy of a  weak character.           *       *       *       *       *    Everything about Berlioz was misleading, even his appearance. In  legendary portraits he appears as a dark southerner with black hair and  sparkling eyes. But he was really very fair and had blue eyes,[5] and  Joseph d'Ortigue tells us they were deep-set and piercing, though  sometimes clouded by melancholy or languor.[6] He had a broad forehead  furrowed with wrinkles by the time he was thirty, and a thick mane of  hair, or, as E. Legouve puts it, \"a large umbrella of hair, projecting  like a movable awning over the beak of a bird of prey.\"[7]      [Footnote 5: \"I was fair,\" wrote Berlioz to Buelow (unpublished letters,  1858). \"A shock of reddish hair,\" he wrote in his _Memoires_, I, 165.  \"Sandy-coloured hair,\" said Reyer. For the colour of Berlioz's hair I  rely upon the evidence of Mme. Chapot, his niece.]    [Footnote 6: Joseph d'Ortigue, _Le Balcon de l'Opera_, 1833.]    [Footnote 7: E. Legouve, _Soixante ans de souvenirs_. Legouve describes  Berlioz here as he saw him for the first time.]    His mouth was well cut, with lips compressed and puckered at the  corners in a severe fold, and his chin was prominent. He had a deep  voice,[8] but his speech was halting and often tremulous with emotion;  he would speak passionately of what interested him, and at times be  effusive in manner, but more often he was ungracious and reserved. He  was of medium height, rather thin and angular in figure, and when seated  he seemed much taller than he really was.[9] He was very restless, and  inherited from his native land, Dauphine, the mountaineer's passion for  walking and climbing, and the love of a vagabond life, which remained  with him nearly to his death.[10] He had an iron constitution, but he  wrecked it by privation and excess, by his walks in the rain, and by  sleeping out-of-doors in all weathers, even when there was snow on the  ground.[11]    [Footnote 8: \"A passable baritone,\" says Berlioz _(Memoires_, I, 58). In  1830, in the streets of Paris, he sang \"a bass part\" _(Memoires_, I,  156). During his first visit to Germany the Prince of Hechingen made him  sing \"the part of the violoncello\" in one of his compositions  (_Memoires_, II, 32).]    [Footnote 9: There are two good portraits of Berlioz. One is a  photograph by Pierre Petit, taken in 1863, which he sent to Mme. Estelle  Fornier. It shows him leaning on his elbow, with his head bent, and his  eyes fixed on the ground as if he were tired. The other is the  photograph which he had reproduced in the first edition of his  _Memoires_, and which shows him leaning back, his hands in his pockets,  his head upright, with an expression of energy in his face, and a fixed  and stern look in his eyes.]    [Footnote 10: He would go on foot from Naples to Rome in a straight line  over the mountains, and would walk at one stretch from Subiaco to  Tivoli.]    [Footnote 11: This brought on several attacks"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16469"],[0,"The Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland (1753) Volume II.

Be sudden--to our tents--pray thee away,    The hell on earth is love that brings delay.                    *        *        *        *        *                                       THOMAS MAY,      A Poet and historian of the 17th century, was descended of an ancient,  but decayed family in the county of Sussex, in the reign of Queen  Elizabeth[1], and was educated a fellow commoner in Sidney Sussex  College in Cambridge. He afterwards removed to London, and lived about  the court, where he contracted friendships with several gentlemen of  fashion and distinction, especially with Endymion Porter esquire, one  of the gentlemen of the bedchamber to King Charles I. while [sic] he  resided at court he wrote five plays, which are extant under his name.  In 1622, he published at London, in 8vo. a translation of Virgil's  Georgics with annotations; and in 1635, a Poem on King Edward III. It  was printed under the title of the Victorious Reign of Edward III.  written in seven books, by his Majesty's command. In the dedication to  Charles I. our author writes thus; \"I should humbly have craved your  Majesty's pardon for my omission of the latter part of King Edward's  reign, but that the sense of mine own defects hath put me in mind of a  most necessary suit, so beg forgiveness for that part which is here  written. Those great actions of Edward III. are the arguments of this  poem, which is here ended, where his fortune began to decline, where  the French by revolts, and private practices regained that which had  been won from them by eminent and famous victories; which times may  afford fitter observations for an acute historian in prose, than  strains of heighth for an heroic poem.\" The poem thus begins,      The third, and greatest Edward's reign we sing,    The high atchievements of that martial King,    Where long successful prowesse did advance,    So many trophies in triumphed France,    And first her golden lillies bare; who o're    Pyrennes mountains to that western shore,    Where Tagus tumbles through his yellow sand    Into the ocean; stretch'd his conquering hand.    From the lines quoted, the reader will be able to judge what sort of  versifier our author was, and from this beginning he has no great  reason to expect an entertaining poem, especially as it is of the  historical kind; and he who begins a poem thus insipidly, can never  expect his readers to accompany him to the third page. May likewise  translated Lucan's Pharsalia, which poem he continued down to the  death of Julius Caesar, both in Latin and English verse.    Dr. Fuller says, that some disgust was given to him at court, which  alienated his affections from it, and determined him, in the civil  wars to adhere to the Parliament.    Mr. Philips in his Theatrum Poetarum, observes, that he stood  candidate with Sir William Davenant for the Laurel, and his ambition  being frustrated, he conceived the most violent aversion to the King  and Queen. Sir William Davenant, besides the acknowledged superiority  of his abilities, had ever distinguished himself for loyalty, and was  patronized and favoured by men of power, especially the Marquis of  Newcastle: a circumstance which we find not to have happened to May:  it is true, they were both the friends of the amiable Endymion Porter,  esq; but we are not informed whether that gentleman interested himself  on either side.    In the year 1647, was published in London in folio, The History of the  Parliament of England, which began November 3, 1640, with a Short and  Necessary View of some precedent Years, written by Thomas May, Esq;  Secretary to the Parliament, and published by their authority. In 1650  he published in 8vo. A Breviary of the History of the Parliament of  England. Besides these works, Mr. Philips tells us, he wrote a History  of Henry IV. in English verse, the Comedy of the Old Wives Tale, and  the History of Orlando Furioso; but the latter, Mr. Langbaine, who is  a higher authority than Philips, assures us was written before May was  able to hold a pen, much less to write a play, being printed in 4to.  London, 1594. Mr. Winstanley says, that in his history, he shews all  the spleen of a mal-content, and had he been preferred to the Bays, as  he happened to be disappointed, he would have embraced the Royal  interest with as much zeal, as he did the republican: for a man who  espouses a cause from spite only, can be depended upon by no party,  because he acts not upon any principles of honour or conviction.    Our author died suddenly in the year 1652, and was interred near the  tomb of Camden, on the West side of the North isle of Westminster  Abbey, but his body, with several others, was dug up after the  restoration, and buried in a pit in St. Margaret's church yard[2]. Mr.  May's plays are,    1. Agrippina, Empress of Rome, a Tragedy, printed in 12mo. London,  1639. Our author has followed Suetonius and Tacitus, and has  translated and inserted above 30 lines from Petronius Arbiter; this  circumstance we advance on the authority of Langbaine, whose extensive  reading has furnished him with the means of tracing the plots of most  part of our English plays; we have heard that there is a Tragedy on  this subject, written by Mr. Gray of Cambridge, the author of the  beautiful Elegy in a Country Church Yard; which play Mr. Garrick has  sollicited him to bring upon the stage; to which the author has not  yet consented.    2. Antigone, the Theban Princess, a Tragedy, printed in 8vo. London,  1631, and dedicated to Endymion Porter, Esq; Our author in the  contexture of this Tragedy, has made use of the Antigone of Sophocles,  and the Thebais of Seneca.    3. Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, a Tragedy, acted 1626, and printed in  12mo. London, 1639, and dedicated to Sir Kenelme Digby: The author has  followed the historians of those times. We have in our language two  other plays upon the same subject, one by Shakespear, and the other by  Dryden.    4. Heir, a Comedy, acted by the company of revels, 1620; this play is  much commended by Mr. Thomas Carew, in a copy of verses prefixed to  the play, where, amongst other commendations bestowed on the stile,  and natural working up of the passions, he says thus of the oeconomy  of the play.      The whole plot doth alike itself disclose,    Thro' the five Acts, as doth a lock, that goes    With letters, for 'till every one be known,    The lock's as fast, as if you had found none.    If this comedy, is no better than these wretched commendatory lines,  it is miserable indeed.    5. Old Couple, a Comedy, printed in 4to; this play is intended to  expose the vice of covetousness.

Taylour retates [sic] a whimsical story of his schoolmaster Mr. Green,  which we shall here insert upon the authority of Winstanley. \"Green  loved new milk so well, that in order to have it new, he went to the  market to buy a cow, but his eyes being dim, he cheapened a bull, and  asking the price of the beast, the owner and he agreed, and driving it  home, would have his maid to milk it, which she attempting to do,  could find no teats; and whilst the maid and her master were arguing  the matter, the bull very fairly pissed into the pail;\" whereupon his  scholar John Taylour wrote these verses,      Our master Green was overseen      In buying of a bull,    For when the maid did mean to milk,      He piss'd the pail half full.    Our Water-poet found leisure to write fourscore books, some of which  occasioned diversion enough in their time, and were thought worthy to  be collected in a folio volume. Mr. Wood observes, that had he had  learning equal to his natural genius, which was excellent, he might  have equalled, if not excelled, many who claim a great share in the  temple of the muses. Upon breaking out of the rebellion, 1642, he left  London, and retired to Oxford, where he was much esteemed for his  facetious company; he kept a common victualling house there, and  thought he did great service to the Royal cause, by writing Pasquils  against the round-heads. After the garrison of Oxford surrendered, he  retired to Westminster, kept a public house in Phaenix Alley near Long  Acre, and continued constant in his loyalty to the King; after whose  death, he set up a sign over his door, of a mourning crown, but that  proving offensive, he pulled it down, and hung up his own picture[1],  under which were these words,      There's many a head stands for a sign,    Then gentle reader why not mine?    On the other side,      Tho' I deserve not, I desire    The laurel wreath, the poet's hire.    He died in the year 1654, aged 74, and was buried in the church yard  of St. Paul's Covent-Garden; his nephew, a Painter at Oxford, who  lived in Wood's time, informed him of this circumstance, who gave his  picture to the school gallery there, where it now hangs, shewing him  to have had a quick and smart countenance. The following epitaph was  written upon him,      Here lies the Water-poet, honest John,    Who row'd on the streams of Helicon;    Where having many rocks and dangers past,    He at the haven of Heaven arrived at last.
