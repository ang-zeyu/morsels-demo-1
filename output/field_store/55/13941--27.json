Either the parent race mutated, or, as sometimes occurs, a  line of people of superior gifts emerged--not in a few isolated births,  but with surprising regularity in five family clans. There was a short  period of power struggle until they realized the foolishness of civil  war and formed an oligarchy, heading a loose tribal organization. With  the Five Families to push and lead, a new civilization developed, and  when Survey came to call they were no longer savages. Combine bought the  trade rights about seventy-five years ago. Then the Company and the Five  Families got together and marketed a luxury item to the galaxy. You know  how every super-jet big shot on twenty-five planets wants to say he's  hunted on Khatka. And if he can point out a graz head on his wall, or  wear a tail bracelet, he's able to strut with the best. To holiday on  Khatka is both fabulous and fashionable--and very, very profitable for  the natives and for Combine who sells transportation to the travelers.\"    \"I hear they have poachers, too,\" Dane remarked.    \"Yes, that naturally follows. You know what a glam skin brings on the  market. Wherever you have a rigidly controlled export you're going to  have poachers and smugglers. But the Patrol doesn't go to Khatka. The  natives handle their own criminals. Personally, I'd cheerfully take a  ninety-nine-year sentence in the Lunar mines in place of what the  Khatkans dish out to a poacher they net!\"    \"So that rumor has spread satisfactorily!\"    Coffee slopped over the brim of Tau's mug and Dane dropped the packet of  steak concentrate he was about to feed into the cooker. Chief Ranger  Asaki loomed in the doorway of the mess as suddenly as if he had been  teleported to that point.    The medic arose to his feet and smiled politely at the visitor.    \"Do I detect in that observation, sir, the suggestion that the tales I  have heard were deliberately set to blast where they would do the most  good as deterrents?\"    A fleeting grin broke the impassive somberness of the black face.    \"I was informed you are a man skilled in 'magic,' Medic. You certainly  display the traditional sorcerer's quickness of wit. But this rumor is  also truth.\" The quirk of good humor had gone again, and there was an  edge in the Chief Ranger's voice which cut. \"Poachers on Khatka would  welcome the Patrol in place of the attention they now receive.\"    He came into the mess cabin, Jellico behind him, and Dane pulled down  two of the snap seats. He was holding a mug under the spout of the  coffee dispenser as the captain made introductions.    \"Thorson--our acting-cargo-master.\"    \"Thorson,\" the Khatkan acknowledged with a grave nod of his head, and  then glanced down to floor level with a look of surprise. Weaving a  pattern about his legs, purring loudly, Sindbad was offering an  unusually fervent welcome of his own. The Ranger went down on one knee,  his hand out for Sindbad's inquiring sniff. Then the cat butted that  dark palm, batted at it playfully with claw-sheathed paw.    \"A Terran cat! It is of the lion family?\"    \"Far removed,\" Jellico supplied. \"You'd have to add a lot of bulk to  Sindbad to promote him to the lion class.\"    \"We have only the old tales.\" Asaki sounded almost wistful as the cat  jumped to his knee and clawed for a hold on his chest belts. \"But I do  not believe that lions were ever so friendly toward my ancestors.\"    Dane would have removed the cat, but the Khatkan arose with Sindbad,  still purring loudly, resting in the crook of his arm. The Ranger was  smiling with a gentleness which changed the whole arrogant cast of his  countenance.    \"Do not bring this one to Khatka with you, Captain, or you will never  take him away again. Those who dwell in the inner courts would not let  him vanish from their sight. Ah, so this pleases you, small lion?\" He  rubbed Sindbad gently under the throat and the cat stretched his neck,  his yellow eyes half closed in bliss.    \"Thorson,\" the Captain turned to Dane, \"that arrival report on my desk  was the final one from Combine?\"    \"Yes, sir. There's no hope of the _Rover_ setting down here before that  date.\"    Asaki sat down, still holding the cat. \"So you see, Captain, fortune has  arranged it all. You have two tens of days. Four days to go in my  cruiser, four days for your return here, and the rest to explore the  preserve. We could not ask for better luck, for I do not know when our  paths may cross again. In the normal course of events I will not have  another mission to Xecho for a year, perhaps longer. Also--\" He  hesitated and then spoke to Tau. \"Medic, Captain Jellico has informed me  that you have made a study of magic on many worlds.\"    \"That is so, sir.\"    \"Do you then believe that it is real force, or that it is only a  superstition for child-people who set up demons to howl petitions to  when some darkness falls upon them?\"    \"Some of the magic I have seen is trickery, some of it founded upon an  inner knowledge of men and their ways which a shrewd witch doctor can  use to his advantage. There always remains\"--Tau put down his mug,  \"--there always remains a small residue of happenings and results for  which we have not yet found any logical explanations--\"    \"And I believe,\" Asaki interrupted, \"it is also true that a race can be  conditioned from birth to be sensitive to forms of magic so that men of  that blood are particularly susceptible.\" That was more of a statement  than a question, but Tau answered it.    \"That is very true. A Lamorian, for example, can be 'sung' to death. I  have witnessed such a case. But upon a Terran or another off-world man  the same suggestion would have no effect.\"    \"Those who settled Khatka brought such magic with them.\" The Chief  Ranger's fingers still moved about Sindbad's jaw and throat soothingly,  but his tone was chill, the coldest thing in the cramped space of the  mess cabin.    \"Yes, a highly developed form of it,\" Tau agreed.    \"More highly developed perhaps than even you can believe, Medic!\"  That came in a hiss of cold rage. \"I think that its present  manifestation--death by a beast that is not a beast--could be worth  your detailed study.\"    \"Why?\" Tau came bluntly to the point.    \"Because it is a killing magic and it is being carefully used to rid my  world of key men, men we need badly. If there is a weak point in this  cloudy attack shaping against us, we must learn it, and soon!\"    It was Jellico who added the rest. \"We are invited to visit Khatka and  survey a new hunting range as Chief Ranger Asaki's personal term  guests.\"    Dane drew a deep breath of wonder. Guest rights on Khatka were jealously  guarded--they were too valuable to their owners to waste. Whole families  lived on the income from the yearly rental of even half a one. But the  Rangers, by right of office, had several which they could grant to  visiting scientists or men from other worlds holding positions similar  to their own. To have such an opportunity offered to an ordinary Trader  was almost incredible.    His wonder was matched by Tau's and must have been plain to read for the  Chief Ranger smiled.    \"For a long time Captain Jellico and I have exchanged biological data on  alien life-forms--his skill in photographing such, his knowledge as an  xenobiologist are widely recognized. And so I have permission for him to  visit the new Zoboru preserve, not yet officially opened. And you, Medic  Tau, your help, or at least your diagnosis, we need in another  direction. So, one expert comes openly, another not so openly. Though,  Medic, your task is approved by my superiors. And\"--he glanced at  Dane--\"perhaps to muddle the trail for the suspicious, shall we not ask  this young man also?\"    Dane's eyes went to the captain. Jellico was always fair and his crew  would have snapped into action on his word alone--even if they were  fronting a rain of Thorkian death darts and that order was to advance.  But, on the other hand, Dane would never have asked a favor, and the  best he hoped for was to be able to perform his duties without  unfavorable comment upon their commission. He had no reason to believe  Jellico was willing to agree to this.    \"You have two weeks' planet-side leave coming, Thorson. If you want to  spend it on Khatka....\" Jellico actually grinned then. \"I take it that  you do. When do we up-ship, sir?\"    \"You said that you must wait for the return of your other crew  members--shall we say mid-afternoon tomorrow?\" The Chief Ranger stood up  and put Sindbad down though the cat protested with several sharp meows.    \"Small lion,\" the tall Khatkan spoke to the cat as to an equal, \"this is  your jungle, and mine lies elsewhere. But should you ever grow tired of  traveling the stars, there is always a home for you in my courts.\"    When the Chief Ranger went out the door, Sindbad did not try to follow,  but he uttered one mournful little cry of protest and loss.    \"So he wants a trouble shooter, does he?\" Tau asked. \"All right, I'll  try to hunt out his goblins for him; it'll be worth that to visit  Khatka!\"    Dane, remembering the hot glare of the Xecho spaceport, the sea one  could not swim in, contrasted that with the tri-dees he had seen of the  green hunters' paradise on the next planet of the system. \"Yes, sir!\" he  echoed and made a haphazard choice for the cooker.    \"Don't be too lighthearted,\" Tau warned. \"I'll say that any stew which  was too hot for that Ranger to handle might give us burned fingers--and  quick. When we land on Khatka, walk softly and look over your shoulder,  and be prepared for the worst.\"          II      Lightning played along the black ridges above them, and below was a  sheer drop to a river which was only a silver thread.

[Illustration: XXI. Capital from the Apse of the Church of S. Vitale,  Ravenna, Italy.]      XXI.    CAPITAL FROM THE APSE OF THE CHURCH OF S. VITALE, RAVENNA, ITALY.    This is one of the most beautiful and most characteristic capitals of  the Byzantine style. Its form and decoration are both typical of the  style. The flat treatment of the interlace of the vine motive is very  generally used, and can be seen in great variety in S. Vitale and  elsewhere. The ornament is here enriched with gold and color. In the  double capitals of Ravenna the upper member, or cushion, is usually  ornamented with symbolic designs drawn from various sources, both Pagan  and Christian.          [Illustration: XXII. Capital from the Church of S. Vitale, Ravenna,  Italy.]      XXII.    CAPITAL FROM THE CHURCH OF S. VITALE, RAVENNA, ITALY.    Here again is the rhomboidal double capital of a much more severe design  than that of the preceding plate, but with a remarkable delicacy and  refinement of treatment.          [Illustration: XXIII. Capital from the Church of S. Vitale, Ravenna,  Italy.]      XXIII.    CAPITAL FROM THE CHURCH OF S. VITALE, RAVENNA, ITALY.    This is a mean between the two extreme types shown in Plates XXI. and  XXII.    In all these examples the treatment of the angles should be noted.  Strong confining lines, with a distinct upward tendency of the ornament,  contrasted with the flat sides, contribute much to the good effect of  these capitals as constructive members.

The  contributions of the present year to this department of an architect's  library are especially notable. Of the catalogues which have come to our  notice, that of the architectural exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts  in Philadelphia is in point of illustration the most complete, and shows  the most judicious selection of material. In this there was a marked  endeavor to give as large a number of geometrical drawings as possible,  and it is unquestionably a move in the right direction. The desire for  the picturesque, which has been until recently the ruling motive with  American architects, has had its day, and trained and conservative  designers have gradually taken the place of the pyrotechnic draughtsman  of the past. The change has been working gradually to be sure, but scale  and detail drawings both in the exhibitions, which of necessity are  intended to appeal to a more or less popular taste, and in the  professional journals are from year to year growing more prominent. In  their recognition of this tendency, the Philadelphia catalogue committee  are to be highly commended.    The same trend may be observed in a little less marked degree in the  Architectural League catalogue. The exhibitions of the League have for  years been the models by which minor exhibitions have been ruled, and  its catalogue has been a guide to all others. As usual there is a great  deal of valuable and interesting material presented in its  illustrations.    The Catalogue Committee of the St. Louis exhibition have made a  departure from the general rule, and increased the size of their pages,  allowing the use of much larger plates. In some of the drawings this is  a distinct advantage, and their catalogue gains in consequence.    The Boston Society of Architects and the Boston Architectural Club will  hold a joint exhibition in April, and their catalogue now promises to be  a very creditable publication.           *       *       *       *       *    In the recent draughtsmen's competitions, Boston has been more than  ordinarily fortunate. The medal in both the competitions of the Society  of Beaux-Arts Architects has come to Mr. F. M. Mann, of the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a number of the first and  second mentions have also come to Boston. In fact, nearly if not quite  all the designs sent from Boston have received some recognition at the  hands of the jury.    A complimentary dinner has been arranged for by the M. I. T.  Architectural Society in honor of the winners of the last competition.    The annual competition for the Architectural League gold medal, which  was awarded to Mr. A. H. Wright, also resulted in adding another victory  to the credit of Boston draughtsmen.    Interest in these contests is not purely local, however, for  Philadelphia, Rochester, and several other cities have furnished  contributors and shared the honors. Mr. H. L. Duhring, Jr., of  Philadelphia, was awarded the Architectural League silver medal.           *       *       *       *       *    Fulfilling the bequest of the late Arthur Rotch leaving $5,000 to the  Boston Architectural Club, this sum has been paid to the treasurer of  the club by the executors of Mr. Rotch's estate. The income only is to  be expended in the purchase of books to form an architectural library.  This is only one of many indications that the architectural clubs of the  country are recognized as permanent and established institutions. With  the spread of this feeling their influence will grow in importance, and  as the working foundation of the profession they deserve all the  encouragement that can be given them.          The Cleveland Architectural Club.      There are none of the now numerous architectural associations of the  country which can more deservingly congratulate themselves upon the  early success of their first few months of existence than the Cleveland  Architectural Club, which was organized on the 22d of last November, and  is now only four months old.    Its original members, fifteen in number, met in the office of Messrs.  Coburn & Barnum, and here the meetings for the few succeeding weeks were  also held.    It soon became evident that a wide field of usefulness was open to the  new organization, and a permanent location of its own would become  necessary. Such a location in the heart of the city, with all necessary  conveniences, was found in the Garfield Building, and the new rooms have  been properly fitted up for the use of the club.    With the purpose of making the influence of its work as far-reaching as  possible, the restriction which has commonly been applied in other  similar clubs, limiting the membership to architects and draughtsmen, or  at least limiting the number of non professional members, has been  entirely done away with, and any one who may have an interest in  architecture or the \"allied arts\" is eligible for membership. What will  be the effect of this arrangement it remains for the future to decide.  In some of the older clubs it has been found by experience that the  professional membership was overbalanced and its work impeded by a too  large non-professional element, and the professional lines have been  closely drawn in consequence.    The work thus far entered upon is modest but of an important character,  and if pursued with the earnest purpose which has marked the first few  months will lead to a fruitful future.    Of the monthly competitions in design the one for March, the subject of  which is a scheme for the public buildings of Cleveland, has attracted  considerable attention, and the public exhibition of the designs will  doubtless lead to profitable discussion outside the club. A plan which  we believe has not been adopted here, but which has been the means of  awakening considerable interest in the study of design in the clubs of  New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, might possibly be followed to  advantage. In the January number of THE BROCHURE SERIES the competitions  instituted by the Society of Beaux-Arts Architects were outlined. Of  course with all the numberless calls upon his time, the average  draughtsman does not have the leisure to properly study and render the  drawings required in these competitions; but by the joining of forces  four or five, or even more, men can easily work out such a problem, and  in some respects the advantages to be gained are greater than is the  case when an individual works alone. Several large tables can be  provided in the club-rooms, and the problem worked up as a club design.  This plan has been followed in the Boston Architectural Club with great  success.    The study of academic design is of the utmost importance to the young  architect, and unfortunately the opportunities for such study in the  usual routine of office practice are not very extensive. The working out  each season of two or three such designs as those required by the  Beaux-Arts Society will be of material benefit to the older men who are  already familiar with the academic methods of design, and of much more  benefit to the younger men whose opportunities have been more limited.  The criticism and suggestion of the older men in the profession is  easily obtained while the work is in progress. Nothing could be better  calculated to foster a certain _esprit de corps_, which is certainly a  desirable quality in any club.    The personnel of the Cleveland Club is as follows: Benj. S. Hubbell,  president; Harry S."]]]
