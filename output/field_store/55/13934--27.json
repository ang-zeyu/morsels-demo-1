He pulled  it down, and in defiance of all attempts to take it from him, lay on it  all night, and would not even allow any person to touch it. Every  evening afterward, about sunset, he left home, traveled to the  grave-yard, reposed on the grave of his late master all night, and  returned home regularly in the morning. But, what was still more  remarkable, he could not be persuaded to eat a morsel. Children near the  grave-yard, who watched his motions, again and again carried him food;  but he resolutely refused it, and it was never known by what means he  existed. While at home he was always dull and sorrowful; he usually lay  in a sleeping posture, and frequently uttered long and mournful groans.    [Illustration: THE DOG AT HIS MASTER'S GRAVE.]    In the western part of our own country, some years since, an exploit was  performed by a Newfoundland dog, which I must tell my readers. It is  related by Mrs. Phelan. A man by the name of Wilson, residing near a  river which was navigable, although the current was somewhat rapid, kept  a pleasure boat. One day he invited a small party to accompany him in an  excursion on the river. They set out. Among the number were Mr. Wilson's  wife and little girl, about three years of age. The child was delighted  with the boat, and with the water lilies that floated on the surface of  the river. Meanwhile, a fine Newfoundland dog trotted along the bank of  the stream, looking occasionally at the boat, and thinking, perhaps,  that he should like a sail himself.    Pleasantly onward went the boat, and the party were in the highest  spirits, when little Ellen, trying to get a pretty lily, stretched out  her hand over the side of the boat, and in a moment she lost her balance  and fell into the river. What language can describe the agony of those  parents when they saw the current close over their dear child! The  mother, in her terror, could hardly be prevented from throwing herself  into the river to rescue her drowning girl, and her husband had to hold  her back by force. Vain was the help of man at that dreadful moment; but  prayer was offered up to God, and he heard it.    No one took any notice of Nero, the faithful dog. But he had kept his  eye upon the boat, it seems. He saw all that was going on; he plunged  into the river at the critical moment when the child had sunk to the  bottom, and dived beneath the surface. Suddenly a strange noise was  heard on the side of the boat opposite to the one toward which the party  were anxiously looking, and something seemed to be splashing in the  water. It was the dog. Nero had dived to the bottom of that deep river,  and found the very spot where the poor child had settled down into her  cold, strange cradle of weeds and slime. Seizing her clothes, and  holding them fast in his teeth, he brought her up to the surface of the  water, a very little distance from the boat, and with looks that told  his joy, he gave the little girl into the hands of her astonished  father. Then, swimming back to the shore, he shook the water from his  long, shaggy coat, and laid himself down, panting, to recover from the  fatigue of his adventure.    [Illustration: NERO SAVING LITTLE ELLEN.]    Ellen seemed for awhile to be dead; her face was deadly pale; it hung  on her shoulder; her dress showed that she had sunk to the bottom. But  by and by she recovered gradually, and in less than a week she was as  well as ever.    But the Glasgow Chronicle tells a story of the most supremely humane dog  I ever heard of--so humane, in fact, that his humanity was somewhat  troublesome. This dog--a fine Newfoundland--resided near Edinburgh.  Every day he was seen visiting all the ponds and brooks in the  neighborhood of his master's residence. He had been instrumental more  than once in saving persons from drowning. He was respected for his  magnanimity, and caressed for his amiable qualities, till, strange as it  may be considered, this flattery completely turned his head. Saving life  became a passion. He took to it as men take to dram-drinking. Not having  sufficient scope for the exercise of his diseased benevolence in the  district, he took to a very questionable method of supplying the  deficiency. Whenever he found a child on the brink of a pond, he watched  patiently for the opportunity to place his fore-paws suddenly on its  person, and plunged it in before it was aware. Now all this was done for  the mere purpose of fetching them out again. He appeared to find intense  pleasure in this nonsensical sort of work. At last the outcry became so  great by parents alarmed for their children, although no life was ever  lost by the indulgence of such a singular taste, that the poor dog was  reluctantly destroyed.    Mr. Bingley, an English writer, has contributed not a little to the  amusement and instruction of the young, by a book which he published a  few years ago, relating to the instinct of the dog. Among the stories  told in this book, are several which I must transfer for my own readers.  Here is one about the fatal adventure of a large mastiff with a robber.  I shall give it nearly in the words of Mr. Bingley.    Not a great many years ago, a lady, who resided in a lonely house in  Cheshire, England, permitted all her domestics, save one female, to go  to a supper at an inn about three miles distant, which was kept by the  uncle of the girl who remained at home with her mistress. As the  servants were not expected to return till the morning, all the doors and  windows were as usual secured, and the lady and her companion were about  to retire to bed, when they were alarmed by the noise of some persons  apparently attempting to break into the house. A large mastiff, which  fortunately happened to be in the kitchen, set up a tremendous barking;  but this had not the effect of intimidating the robbers.    After listening attentively for some time, the maid-servant discovered  that the robbers were attempting to enter the house by forcing their way  through a hole under the sunk story in the back kitchen. Being a young  woman of courage, she went toward the spot, accompanied by the dog, and  patting him on the back, exclaimed, \"At him, Caesar!\" The dog leaped into  the hole, made a furious attack upon the intruder, and gave something a  violent shake. In a few minutes all became quiet, and the animal  returned with his mouth full of blood. A slight bustle was now heard  outside the house, but in a short time all again became still. The lady  and servant, too much terrified to think of going to bed, sat up until  morning without further molestation. When day dawned they discovered a  quantity of blood outside of the wall in the court-yard.    When her fellow-servants came home, they brought word to the girl that  her uncle, the inn-keeper, had died suddenly of apoplexy during the  night, and that it was intended that the funeral should take place in  the course of the day. Having obtained leave to go to the funeral, she  was surprised to learn, on her arrival, that the coffin was screwed  down. She insisted, however, on taking a last look at the body, which  was most unwillingly granted; when, to her great surprise and horror,  she discovered that his death had been occasioned by a large wound in  the throat. The events of the preceding night rushed on her mind, and it  soon became evident to her that she had been the innocent and unwilling  cause of her uncle's death. It turned out, that he and one of his  servants had formed the design of robbing the house and murdering the  lady during the absence of her servants, but that their wicked design  had been frustrated by the courage and watchfulness of her faithful  mastiff.    [Illustration: THE SERVANT AND THE MASTIFF.]    There is another anecdote told of a wild Indian dog which I am sure my  young friends will like. It is from the same source with the one about  the mastiff. A man by the name of Le Fevre, many years ago, lived on a  farm in the United States, near the Blue mountains. Those mountains at  that time abounded in deer and other animals. One day, the youngest of  Le Fevre's children, who was four years old, disappeared early in the  morning. The family, after a partial search, becoming alarmed, had  recourse to the assistance of some neighbors. These separated into  parties, and explored the woods in every direction, but without success.  Next day the search was renewed, but with no better result. In the  midst of their distress Tewenissa, a native Indian from Anaguaga, on the  eastern branch of the river Susquehannah, who happened to be journeying  in that quarter, accompanied by his dog Oniah, happily went into the  house of the planter with the design of reposing himself. Observing the  distress of the family, and being informed of the circumstances, he  requested that the shoes and stockings last worn by the child should be  brought to him. He then ordered his dog to smell them; and taking the  house for a centre, described a semicircle of a quarter of a mile,  urging the dog to find out the scent. They had not gone far before the  sagacious animal began to bark. The track was followed up by the dog  with still louder barking, till at last, darting off at full speed, he  was lost in the thickness of the woods. Half an hour after they saw him  returning. His countenance was animated, bearing even an expression of  joy; it was evident he had found the child--but was he dead or alive?  This was a moment of cruel suspense, but it was of short continuance.  The Indian followed his dog, and the excellent animal conducted him to  the lost child, who was found unharmed, lying at the foot of a great  tree. Tewenissa took him in his arms, and returned with him to the  distressed parents and their friends, who had not been able to  advance with the same speed. He restored little Derick to his father and  mother, who ran to meet him; when a scene of tenderness and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18779"],[0,"Physiology and Hygiene for Secondary Schools (#2)"],[1,"what is and  what is not in harmony with the plan of the body, and to find the means of  applying this knowledge to the everyday problems of living. Such is the  general aim of hygiene. Stated in other words: Hygiene has for its general  aim the bringing about of an essential harmony between the body and the  things and conditions that affect it.(1)    *Relation of Anatomy and Physiology to the Study of Hygiene.*--If the chief  object in studying the body is that of learning how to manage or care for  it, and hygiene supplies this information, why must we also study anatomy  and physiology? The answer to this question has already been in part  suggested. In order to determine what things and conditions are in harmony  with the plan of the body, we must know what that plan is. This knowledge  is obtained through a study of anatomy and physiology. The knowledge  gained through these subjects also renders the study of hygiene more  interesting and valuable. One is enabled to see _why_ and _how_ obedience  to hygienic laws benefits, and disobedience to them injures, the body.  This causes the teachings of hygiene to be taken more seriously and  renders them more practical. In short, anatomy and physiology supply a  necessary basis for the study of hygiene.    *Advantages of Properly Managing the Body.*--One result following the  mismanagement of the body is loss of health. But attending the loss of  health are other results which are equally serious and far-reaching.  Without good health, people fail to accomplish their aims and ambitions in  life; they miss the joy of living; they lose their ability to work and  become burdens on their friends or society. The proper management of the  body means health, and it also means the capacity for work and for  enjoyment. Not only should one seek to preserve his health from day to  day, but he should so manage his body as to use his powers to the best  advantage and prolong as far as possible the period during which he may be  a capable and useful citizen.          CHAPTER II - GENERAL VIEW OF THE BODY      *External Divisions.*--Examined from the outside, the body presents certain  parts, or divisions, familiar to all. The main, or central, portion is  known as the _trunk_, and to this are attached the _head_, the _upper  extremities_, and the _lower extremities_. These in turn present smaller  divisions which are also familiar. The upper part of the trunk is known as  the _thorax_, or chest, and the lower part as the _abdomen_. The portions  of the trunk to which the arms are attached are the _shoulders_, and those  to which the legs are joined are the _hips_, while the central rear  portion between the neck and the hips is the _back_. The fingers, the  hand, the wrist, the forearm, the elbow, and the upper arm are the main  divisions of each of the upper extremities. The toes, the foot, the ankle,  the lower leg, the knee, and the thigh are the chief divisions of each of  the lower extremities. The head, which is joined to the trunk by the neck,  has such interesting parts as the eyes, the ears, the nose, the jaws, the  cheeks, and the mouth. The entire body is inclosed in a double covering,  called the _skin_, which protects it in various ways.    *The Tissues.*--After examining the external features of the body, we  naturally inquire about its internal structures. These are not so easily  investigated, and much which is of interest to advanced students must be  omitted from an elementary course. We may, however, as a first step in  this study, determine what kinds of materials enter into the construction  of the body. For this purpose the body of some small animal should be  dissected and studied. (See observation at close of chapter.) The  different materials found by such a dissection correspond closely to the  substances, called _tissues_, which make up the human body. The main  tissues of the body, as ordinarily named, are the _muscular_ tissue, the  _osseous_ tissue, the _connective_ tissue, the _nervous_ tissue, the  _adipose_ tissue, the _cartilaginous_ tissue, and the _epithelial_ and  _glandular_ tissue. Most of these present different varieties, making all  together some fifteen different kinds of tissues that enter into the  construction of the body.(2)    *General Purposes of the Tissues.*--The tissues, first of all, _form the  body_. As a house is constructed of wood, stone, plaster, iron, and other  building materials, so is the body made up of its various tissues. For  this reason the tissues have been called the _building materials_ of the  body.    In addition to forming the body, the tissues supply the means through  which its work is carried on. They are thus the _working materials_ of the  body. In serving this purpose the tissues play an active role. All of them  must perform the activities of growth and repair, and certain ones (the  so-called active tissues) must do work which benefits the body as a whole.    *Purposes of the Different Tissues.*--In the construction of the body and  also in the work which it carries on, the different tissues are made to  serve different purposes. The osseous tissue is the chief substance in the  bony framework, or skeleton, while the muscular tissue produces the  different movements of the body. The connective tissue, which is  everywhere abundant, serves the general purpose of connecting the  different parts together. Cartilaginous tissue forms smooth coverings over  the ends of the bones and, in addition to this, supplies the necessary  stiffness in organs like the larynx and the ear. The nervous tissue  controls the body and brings it into proper relations with its  surroundings, while the epithelial tissue (found upon the body surfaces  and in the glands) supplies it with protective coverings and secretes  liquids. The adipose tissue (fat) prevents the too rapid escape of heat  from the body, supplies it with nourishment in time of need, and forms  soft pads for delicate organs like the eyeball.    *Properties of the Tissues.*--If we inquire how the tissues are able to  serve such widely different purposes, we find this answer. The tissues  differ from one another both in composition and in structure and, on this  account, differ in their properties.(3) Their different properties enable  them to serve different purposes in the body. Somewhat as glass is adapted  by its transparency, hardness, and toughness to the use made of it in  windows, the special properties of the tissues adapt them to the kinds of  service which they perform. Properties that adapt tissues to their work in  the body are called _essential_ properties. The most important of these  essential properties are as follows:    1. Of osseous tissue, hardness, stiffness, and toughness. 2. Of muscular  tissue, contractility and irritability. 3. Of nervous tissue, irritability  and conductivity. 4. Of cartilaginous tissue, stiffness and elasticity. 5.  Of connective tissue, toughness and pliability. 6. Of epithelial tissue,  ability to resist the action of external forces and power to secrete.                                     [Fig. 1]       Fig. 1--Hand and forearm, showing the grouping of muscular and connective                      tissues in the organ for grasping.      *Tissue Groups.*--In the construction of the body the tissues are grouped  together to form its various divisions or parts. A group of tissues which  serves some special purpose is known as an _organ_. The hand, for example,  is an organ for grasping (Fig. 1). While the different organs of the body  do not always contain the same tissues, and never contain them in the same  proportions, they do contain such tissues as their work requires and these  have a special arrangement--one adapted to the work which the organs  perform.    In addition to forming the organs, the tissues are also grouped in such a  manner as to provide supports for organs and to form cavities in which  organs are placed. The various cavities of the body are of particular  interest and importance. The three largest ones are the _cranial_ cavity,  containing the brain; the _thoracic_ cavity, containing the heart and the  lungs; and the _abdominal_ cavity, containing the stomach, the liver, the  intestines, and other important organs (Fig. 2). Smaller cavities serving  different purposes are also found.                                     [Fig. 2]         Fig. 2--Diagram of a lengthwise section of the body to show its large                 cavities and the organs which they contain.      *Organs and Systems.*--The work of the body is carried on by its various  organs. Many, in fact the majority, of these organs serve more than one  purpose. The tongue is used in talking, in masticating the food, and in  swallowing. The nose serves at least three distinct purposes. The mouth,  the arms, the hands, the feet, the legs, the liver, the lungs, and the  stomach are also organs that serve more than one purpose. This introduces  the principle of economy into the construction of the body and diminishes  the number of organs that would otherwise be required.    The various organs also _combine_ with one another in carrying on the work  of the body. An illustration of this is seen in the digestion of the  food--a process which requires the combined action of the mouth, stomach,  liver, intestines, and other organs. A number of organs working together  for the same purpose form a _system_. The chief systems of the body are  the digestive system, the circulatory system, the respiratory system, the  muscular system, and the nervous system.    *The Organ and its Work.*--A most interesting question relating to the work  of the organ is this: Does the organ work for its own benefit or for the  benefit of the body as a whole? Does the hand, for example, grasp for  itself or in order that the entire body may come into possession? Only  slight study is sufficient to reveal the fact that each organ performs a  work which"]]]
