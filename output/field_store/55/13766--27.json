It has been objected against me by some that my accounts and descriptions  of things are dry and jejune, not filled with variety of pleasant matter  to divert and gratify the curious reader. How far this is true I must  leave to the world to judge. But if I have been exactly and strictly  careful to give only true relations and descriptions of things (as I am  sure I have) and if my descriptions be such as may be of use not only to  myself (which I have already in good measure experienced) but also to  others in future voyages; and likewise to such readers at home as are  more desirous of a plain and just account of the true nature and state of  the things described than of a polite and rhetorical narrative: I hope  all the defects in my style will meet with an easy and ready pardon.    Others have taxed me with borrowing from other men's journals; and with  insufficiency, as if I was not myself the author of what I write but  published things digested and drawn up by others. As to the first part of  this objection I assure the reader I have taken nothing from any man  without mentioning his name, except some very few relations and  particular observations received from credible persons who desired not to  be named; and these I have always expressly distinguished in my books  from what I relate as of my own observing. And as to the latter I think  it so far from being a diminution to one of my education and employment  to have what I write revised and corrected by friends that, on the  contrary, the best and most eminent authors are not ashamed to own the  same thing, and look upon it as an advantage.    Lastly I know there are some who are apt to slight my accounts and  descriptions of things as if it was an easy matter and of little or no  difficulty to do all that I have done, to visit little more than the  coasts of unknown countries, and make short and imperfect observations of  things only near the shore. But whoever is experienced in these matters,  or considers things impartially, will be of a very different opinion. And  anyone who is sensible how backward and refractory the seamen are apt to  be in long voyages when they know not whither they are going, how  ignorant they are of the nature of the winds and the shifting seasons of  the monsoons, and how little even the officers themselves generally are  skilled in the variation of the needle and the use of the azimuth  compass; besides the hazard of all outward accidents in strange and  unknown seas: anyone, I say, who is sensible of these difficulties will  be much more pleased at the discoveries and observations I have been able  to make than displeased with me that I did not make more.    Thus much I thought necessary to premise in my own vindication against  the objections that have been made to my former performances. But not to  trouble the reader any further with matters of this nature; what I have  more to offer shall be only in relation to the following voyage.    For the better apprehending the course of this voyage and the situation  of the places mentioned in it I have here, as in the former volumes,  caused a map to be engraven with a pricked line representing to the eye  the whole thread of the voyage at one view, besides charts and figures of  particular places, to make the descriptions I have given of them more  intelligible and useful.    Moreover, which I had not opportunity of doing in my former voyages;  having now had in the ship with me a person skilled in drawing, I have by  this means been enabled, for the greater satisfaction of the curious  reader, to present him with exact cuts and figures of several of the  principal and most remarkable of those birds, beasts, fishes and plants,  which are described in the following narrative; and also of several  which, not being able to give any better or so good an account of, as by  causing them to be exactly engraven, the reader will not find any further  description of them, but only that they were found in such or such  particular countries. The plants themselves are in the hands of the  ingenious Dr. Woodward. I could have caused many others to be drawn in  like manner but that I resolved to confine myself to such only as had  some very remarkable difference in the shape of their principal parts  from any that are found in Europe. I have besides several birds and  fishes ready drawn, which I could not put into the present volume because  they were found in countries to the description whereof the following  narrative does not reach. For, being obliged to prepare for another  voyage sooner than I at first expected, I have not been able to continue  the ensuing narrative any further than to my departure from the coast of  New Holland. But if it please God that I return again safe, the reader  may expect a continuation of this voyage from my departure from New  Holland till the foundering of my ship near the island of Ascension.    In the meantime to make the narrative in some measure complete I shall  here add a summary abstract of the latter part of the voyage, whereof I  have not had time to draw out of my journals a full and particular  account at large. Departing therefore from the coast of New Holland in  the beginning of September 1699 we arrived at Timor September 15 and  anchored off that island. On the 24th we obtained a small supply of fresh  water from the governor of a Dutch fort and factory there; we found also  there a Portuguese settlement and were kindly treated by them. On the 3rd  of December we arrived on the coast of New Guinea; where we found good  fresh water and had commerce with the inhabitants of a certain island  called Pulo Sabuda. After which, passing to the northward, we ranged  along the coast to the easternmost part of New Guinea, which I found does  not join to the mainland of New Guinea, but is an island, as I have  described it in my map, and called it New Britain.    It is probable this island may afford many rich commodities, and the  natives may be easily brought to commerce. But the many difficulties I at  this time met with, the want of convenience to clean my ship, the fewness  of my men, their desire to hasten home, and the danger of continuing in  these circumstances in seas where the shoals and coasts were utterly  unknown and must be searched out with much caution and length of time,  hindered me from prosecuting any further at present my intended search.  What I have been able to do in this matter for the public service will, I  hope, be candidly received; and no difficulties shall discourage me from  endeavouring to promote the same end whenever I have an opportunity put  into my hands.    May 18 in our return we arrived at Timor. June 21 we passed by part of  the island Java. July 4 we anchored in Batavia Road, and I went ashore,  visited the Dutch General, and desired the privilege of buying provisions  that I wanted, which was granted me. In this road we lay till the 17th of  October following, when, having fitted the ship, recruited myself with  provisions, filled all my water, and the season of the year for returning  towards Europe being come, I set sail from Batavia, and on the 19th of  December made the Cape of Good Hope, whence departing January 11 we made  the island of St. Helena on the 31st; and February the 21st the island of  Ascension; near to which my ship, having sprung a leak which could not be  stopped, foundered at sea; with much difficulty we got ashore where we  lived on goats and turtle; and on the 26th of February found, to our  great comfort, on the south-east side of a high mountain, about half a  mile from its top, a spring of fresh water. I returned to England in the  Canterbury East India ship. For which wonderful deliverance from so many  and great dangers I think myself bound to return continual thanks to  Almighty God; whose divine providence if it shall please to bring me safe  again to my native country from my present intended voyage; I hope to  publish a particular account of all the material things I observed in the  several places which I have now but barely mentioned.    ...            A VOYAGE TO TERRA AUSTRALIS.          1699.    CHAPTER 1. DEPARTURE AND PROVISIONING EN ROUTE.    THE AUTHOR'S DEPARTURE FROM THE DOWNS.    I sailed from the Downs early on Saturday, January 14, 1699, with a fair  wind, in His Majesty's Ship the Roebuck; carrying but 12 guns in this  voyage and 50 men and boys with 20 months' provision. We had several of  the King's ships in company, bound for Spithead and Plymouth, and by noon  we were off Dungeness.    A CAUTION TO THOSE WHO SAIL IN THE CHANNEL.    We parted from them that night, and stood down the Channel, but found  ourselves next morning nearer the French coast than we expected; Cape de  Hague bearing south-east and by east 6 leagues. There were many other  ships, some nearer, some farther off the French coast, who all seemed to  have gone nearer to it than they thought they should. My master, who was  somewhat troubled at it at first, was not displeased however to find that  he had company in his mistake: which as I have heard is a very common  one, and fatal to many ships. The occasion of it is the not allowing for  the change of the variation since the making of the charts; which Captain  Halley has observed to be very considerable. I shall refer the reader to  his own account of it which he caused to be published in a single sheet  of paper, purposely for a caution to such as pass to and fro the English  Channel. And my own experience thus confirming to me the usefulness of  such a caution I was willing to take this occasion of helping towards the  making it the more public.    Not to trouble the reader with every day's run, nor with the winds or  weather (but only in the remoter parts, where it may be more particularly  useful) standing away from Cape la Hague, we made the start about 5 that  afternoon; which being the last land we saw"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15697"],[0,"True Stories of History and Biography (#2)"],[1,"continued to  suffer grievous persecution on account of their religious opinions. They  began to look around them for some spot where they might worship God, not  as the king and bishops thought fit, but according to the dictates of  their own consciences. When their brethren had gone from Holland to  America, they bethought themselves that they likewise might find refuge  from persecution there. Several gentlemen among them purchased a tract of  country on the coast of Massachusetts Bay, and obtained a charter from  King Charles, which authorized them to make laws for the settlers. In the  year 1628, they sent over a few people, with John Endicott at their head,  to commence a plantation at Salem. Peter Palfrey, Roger Conant, and one or  two more, had built houses there in 1626, and may be considered as the  first settlers of that ancient town. Many other Puritans prepared to  follow Endicott.    \"And now we come to the chair, my dear children,\" said Grandfather. \"This  chair is supposed to have been made of an oak tree which grew in the park  of the English earl of Lincoln, between two and three centuries ago. In  its younger days it used, probably, to stand in the hall of the earl's  castle. Do not you see the coat of arms of the family of Lincoln, carved  in the open work of the back? But when his daughter, the Lady Arbella, was  married to a certain Mr. Johnson, the earl gave her this valuable chair.\"    \"Who was Mr. Johnson?\" inquired Clara.    \"He was a gentleman of great wealth, who agreed with the Puritans in their  religious opinions,\" answered Grandfather. \"And as his belief was the same  as theirs, he resolved that he would live and die with them. Accordingly,  in the month of April, 1630, he left his pleasant abode and all his  comforts in England, and embarked with the Lady Arbella, on board of a  ship bound for America.\"    As Grandfather was frequently impeded by the questions and observations of  his young auditors, we deem it advisable to omit all such prattle as is  not essential to the story. We have taken some pains to find out exactly  what Grandfather said, and here offer to our readers, as nearly as  possible in his own words, the story of        THE LADY ARBELLA      The ship in which Mr. Johnson and his lady embarked, taking Grandfather's  chair along with them, was called the Arbella, in honor of the lady  herself. A fleet of ten or twelve vessels, with many hundred passengers,  left England about the same time; for a multitude of people, who were  discontented with the king's government and oppressed by the bishops, were  flocking over to the new world. One of the vessels in the fleet was that  same Mayflower which had carried the Puritan pilgrims to Plymouth. And  now, my children, I would have you fancy yourselves in the cabin of the  good ship Arbella; because if you could behold the passengers aboard that  vessel, you would feel what a blessing and honor it was for New England to  have such settlers. They were the best men and women of their day.    Among the passengers was John Winthrop, who had sold the estate of his  forefathers, and was going to prepare a new home for his wife and children  in the wilderness. He had the king's charter in his keeping, and was  appointed the first Governor of Massachusetts. Imagine him a person of  grave and benevolent aspect, dressed in a black velvet suit, with a broad  ruff around his neck and a peaked beard upon his chin. There was likewise  a minister of the Gospel, whom the English bishops had forbidden to  preach, but who knew that he should have liberty both to preach and pray  in the forests of America. He wore a black cloak, called a Geneva cloak,  and had a black velvet cap, fitting close to his head, as was the fashion  of almost all the Puritan clergymen. In their company came Sir Richard  Saltonstall, who had been one of the five first projectors of the new  colony. He soon returned to his native country. But his descendants still  remain in New England; and the good old family name is as much respected  in our days as it was in those of Sir Richard.    Not only these, but several other men of wealth and pious ministers, were  in the cabin of the Arbella. One had banished himself for ever from the  old hall where his ancestors had lived for hundreds of years. Another had  left his quiet parsonage, in a country town of England. Others had come  from the universities of Oxford or Cambridge, where they had gained great  fame for their learning. And here they all were, tossing upon the  uncertain and dangerous sea, and bound for a home that was more dangerous  than even the sea itself. In the cabin, likewise, sat the Lady Arbella in  her chair, with a gentle and sweet expression on her face, but looking too  pale and feeble to endure the hardships of the wilderness.    Every morning and evening the Lady Arbella gave up her great chair to one  of the ministers, who took his place in it and read passages from the  Bible to his companions. And thus, with prayers and pious conversation,  and frequent singing of hymns, which the breezes caught from their lips  and scattered far over the desolate waves, they prosecuted their voyage,  and sailed into the harbor of Salem in the month of June.    At that period there were but six or eight dwellings in the town; and  these were miserable hovels, with roofs of straw and wooden chimneys. The  passengers in the fleet either built huts with bark and branches of trees,  or erected tents of cloth till they could provide themselves with better  shelter. Many of them went to form a settlement at Charlestown. It was  thought fit that the Lady Arbella should tarry in Salem for a time; she  was probably received as a guest into the family of John Endicott. He was  the chief person in the plantation, and had the only comfortable house  which the new comers had beheld since they left England. So now, children,  you must imagine Grandfather's chair in the midst of a new scene.    Suppose it a hot summer's day, and the lattice-windows of a chamber in Mr.  Endicott's house thrown wide open. The Lady Arbella, looking paler than  she did on shipboard, is sitting in her chair, and thinking mournfully of  far-off England. She rises and goes to the window. There, amid patches of  garden ground and cornfield, she sees the few wretched hovels of the  settlers, with the still ruder wigwams and cloth tents of the passengers  who had arrived in the same fleet with herself. Far and near stretches the  dismal forest of pine trees, which throw their black shadows over the  whole land, and likewise over the heart of this poor lady.    All the inhabitants of the little village are busy. One is clearing a spot  on the verge of the forest for his homestead; another is hewing the trunk  of a fallen pine tree, in order to build himself a dwelling; a third is  hoeing in his field of Indian corn. Here comes a huntsman out of the  woods, dragging a bear which he has shot, and shouting to the neighbors to  lend him a hand. There goes a man to the sea-shore, with a spade and a  bucket, to dig a mess of clams, which were a principal article of food  with the first settlers. Scattered here and there are two or three dusky  figures, clad in mantles of fur, with ornaments of bone hanging from their  ears, and the feathers of wild birds in their coal black hair. They have  belts of shell-work slung across their shoulders, and are armed with bows  and arrows and flint-headed spears. These are an Indian Sagamore and his  attendants, who have come to gaze at the labors of the white men. And now  rises a cry, that a pack of wolves have seized a young calf in the  pasture; and every man snatches up his gun or pike, and runs in chase of  the marauding beasts.    Poor Lady Arbella watches all these sights, and feels that this new world  is fit only for rough and hardy people. None should be here but those who  can struggle with wild beasts and wild men, and can toil in the heat or  cold, and can keep their hearts firm against all difficulties and dangers.  But she is not one of these. Her gentle and timid spirit sinks within her;  and turning away from the window she sits down in the great chair, and  wonders thereabouts in the wilderness her friends will dig her grave.    Mr. Johnson had gone, with Governor Winthrop and most of the other  passengers, to Boston, where he intended to build a house for Lady Arbella  and himself. Boston was then covered with wild woods, and had fewer  inhabitants even than Salem. During her husband's absence, poor Lady  Arbella felt herself growing ill, and was hardly able to stir from the  great chair. Whenever John Endicott noticed her despondency, he doubtless  addressed her with words of comfort. \"Cheer up, my good lady!\" he would  say. \"In a little time, you will love this rude life of the wilderness as  I do.\" But Endicott's heart was as bold and resolute as iron, and he could  not understand why a woman's heart should not be of iron too.    Still, however, he spoke kindly to the lady, and then hastened forth to  till his corn-field and set out fruit trees, or to bargain with the  Indians for furs, or perchance to oversee the building of a fort. Also  being a magistrate, he had often to punish some idler or evil-doer, by  ordering him to be set in the stocks or scourged at the whipping-post.  Often, too, as was the custom of the times, he and Mr. Higginson, the  minister of Salem, held long religious talks together. Thus John Endicott  was a man of multifarious business, and had no time to look back  regretfully to his native land. He felt himself fit for the new world, and  for the work that he had to do, and set himself resolutely to accomplish  it.    What a contrast, my dear children, between this bold, rough, active man,  and the gentle Lady Arbella, who was fading away, like a pale English  flower, in the shadow of the forest! And now the great chair was often  empty, because Lady Arbella grew too "]]]
