Haddon      It is a great pleasure to me to introduce Mr. Williamson's book to  the notice of ethnologists and the general public, as I am convinced  that it will be read with interest and profit.    Perhaps I may be permitted in this place to make a few personal  remarks. Mr. Williamson was formerly a solicitor, and always had a  great longing to see something of savage life, but it was not till  about four years ago that he saw his way to attempting the realisation  of this desire by an expedition to Melanesia. He made my acquaintance  in the summer of 1908, and seeing that he was so keenly interested,  I lent him a number of books and all my MS. notes on Melanesia;  by the help of these and by the study of other books he gained a  good knowledge of the ethnology of that area. In November, 1908, he  started for Oceania for the first time and reached Fiji, from which  place he had intended to start on his expedition. Circumstances  over which he had no control, however, prevented the carrying out  of his original programme; so he went to Sydney, and there arranged  modified plans. He was on the point of executing these, when he was  again frustrated by a telegram from England which necessitated his  immediate return. It was a sad blow to him to have his long-cherished  schemes thus thwarted and rendered abortive, but, undaunted, he set  about to plan another expedition. Accordingly, in January, 1910, he  once more set sail for Australia as a starting place for the Solomon  Islands and British New Guinea, and this time achieved success; the  book which he now offers to the public is the result of this plucky  enterprise. In justice to the author it should be known that, owing  to climatic and other conditions, he was unwell during the whole of  his time in New Guinea, and had an injured foot and leg that hurt him  every step he took. The only wonder is that he was able to accomplish  so large and so thorough a piece of work as he has done.    It is interesting to note the different ways by which various  investigators have entered the field of Ethnology. Some have approached  it from the literary or classical side, but very few indeed of  these have ever had any experience in the field. The majority of  field workers have had a previous training in science--zoology not  unnaturally has sent more recruits than any other branch of science. A  few students have been lawyers, but so far as I am aware Mr. Williamson  is the first British lawyer who has gone into the field, and he has  proved that legal training may be a very good preliminary discipline  for ethnological investigation in the field, as it gives invaluable  practice in the best methods of acquiring and sifting of evidence. A  lawyer must also necessarily have a wide knowledge of human nature  and an appreciation of varied ways of thought and action.    It was with such an equipment and fortified by extensive reading in  Ethnology, that Mr. Williamson was prepared for his self-imposed  task. Proof of his powers of observation will be found in the  excellent descriptions of objects of material culture with which he  has presented us.    I now turn to some of the scientific aspects of his  book. Mr. Williamson especially set before himself the work of  investigating some tribes in the mountainous hinterland of the Mekeo  district. This was a most happy selection, though no one could have  foreseen the especial interest of these people.    Thanks mainly to the systematic investigations of Dr. Seligmann and to  the sporadic observations of missionaries, government officials and  travellers, we have a good general knowledge of many of the peoples  of the eastern coast of the south-eastern peninsula of New Guinea,  and of some of the islands from the Trobriands to the Louisiades. The  Ethnology of the fertile and populous Mekeo district has been mainly  made known to us by the investigations of various members of the  Sacred Heart Mission, and by Dr. Seligmann. What little we know of  the Papuan Gulf district is due to missionaries among the coastal  tribes, Mr. James Chalmers and Mr. W. Holmes. Dr. G. Landtman is at  present investigating the natives of the delta of the Fly river and  Daudai. The natives of the Torres Straits islands have also been  studied as fully as is possible. But of the mountain region lying  behind the Mekeo district very little indeed has been published; so  Mr. Williamson's book fills a gap in our knowledge of Papuan ethnology.    We have as yet a very imperfect knowledge of the ethnological history  of New Guinea. Speaking very broadly, it is generally admitted that  the bulk of the population belongs to the Papuan race, a dark-skinned,  woolly-haired people who have also spread over western Oceania; but,  to a greater or less extent, New Guinea has been subject to cultural  and racial influences from all sides, except from Australia, where the  movement has been the other way. Thus the East Indian archipelago has  directly affected parts of Netherlands New Guinea, and its influence  is to be traced to a variable degree in localities in the Bismarck  archipelago, German New Guinea (Kaiser Wilhelm's Land), Western  Oceania, and British New Guinea or Papua, as it is termed officially.    The south-eastern peninsula of New Guinea--or at all events the  coastal regions--has been largely affected by immigrants, who were  themselves a mixed people, and who came later at various times. It is  to these immigrants that Mr. Ray and I applied the term Melanesian  (Ray, S. H., and Haddon, A. C., \"A Study of the Languages of Torres  Straits,\" _Proc. Roy. Irish Acad._, 3rd ser., IV., 1897, p. 509). Early  in 1894, Mr. Ray read a paper before the Anthropological Institute  (_Journ. Anth. Inst._, XXIV., p. 15), in which he adhered to our former  discrimination of two linguistic stocks and added a third type of  language composed of a mixture of the other two, for which he proposed  the name Melano-Papuan. These languages, according to Mr. Ray, occur  in the Trobriands, Woodlarks and the Louisiades, and similar languages  are found in the northern Solomon Islands. For some years I had been  studying the decorative art of British New Guinea, and from physical  and artistic and other cultural reasons had come to the conclusion  that the Melanesians of British New Guinea should be broken up into  two elements: one consisting of the Motu and allied Melanesians,  and the other of the inhabitants of the Massim district--an area  extending slightly beyond that of Mr. Ray's Melano-Papuans (\"The  Decorative Art of British New Guinea,\" _Cunningham Memoirs_, X.,  _Roy. Irish Acad._, 1894, pp. 253-269). I reinforced my position  six years later (\"Studies in the Anthropo-geography of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],[0,"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#2)"],[1,"y.      The knowledge which mediaeval Europe had of India and Persia was mostly  indirect, and, as might be expected, deficient both in correctness and  extent, resting, as it did, on the statements of classical and patristic  writers, on hearsay and on oral communication. In the accounts of the  classic writers, especially in those of Pliny, Strabo, Ptolemy, truth  and fiction were already strangely blended. Still more was this the case  with such compilers and encyclopaedists as Solinus, Cassiodorus and  Isidorus of Sevilla, on whom the mediaeval scholar depended largely for  information. All these writers, in so far as they speak of India, deal  almost entirely with its physical description, its cities and rivers,  its wealth of precious stones and metals, its spices and silks, and in  particular its marvels and wonders. Of its religion we hear but little,  and as to its literature we have only a few vague statements of  Arrian,[1] Aelian[2] and Dio Chrysostomus.[3] When the last mentioned  author tells us that the ancient Hindus sang in their own language the  poems of Homer, it shows that he had no idea of the fact that the great  Sanskrit epics, to which the passage undoubtedly alludes, were  independent poems. To him they appeared to be nothing more than versions  of Homer. Aelian makes a similar statement, but cautiously adds [Greek].  Philostratus represents the Hindu sage Iarchas as well acquainted with  the Homeric poems, but nowhere does his hero Apollonius of Tyana show the  slightest knowledge of Sanskrit literature.[4]    Nor do the classic authors give us any more information about the  literature of Persia, though the Iranian religion received some  attention. Aristotle and Theopompus were more or less familiar with  Zoroastrian tenets,[5] and allusions to the prophet of ancient Iran are  not infrequent in classic writers. But their information concerning him  is very scanty and inaccurate. To them Zoroaster is simply the great  Magian, more renowned for his magic art than for his religious system.  Of the national Iranian legends, glimpses of which we catch in the  Avesta (esp. Yt. 19), and which must have existed long before the  Sassanian period and the time of Firdausi, the Greek and Roman authors  have recorded nothing.           *       *       *       *       *    But Europe was not limited to the classic and patristic writers for  information about the Orient. The points of contact between the Eastern  and Western world were numerous even before the Portuguese showed the  way to India. Alexandria was the seat of a lively commerce between the  Roman Empire and India during the first six centuries of the Christian  era; the Byzantine Empire was always in close relations, hostile or  friendly, with Persia; the Arabs had settled in Spain, Southern Italy  and Sicily; and the Mongols ruled for almost two centuries in Russia.  All these were factors in the transmission of Oriental influence.[6]  And, as far as Germany is concerned, we must remember that in the tenth  century, owing to the marriage of the emperor Otto II to the Greek  princess Theophano, the relations between the German and Byzantine  Empires were especially close. Furthermore the Hohenstaufen emperor,  Frederick II, it will be remembered, was a friend and patron of the  Saracens in Italy and Sicily, who in turn supported him loyally in his  struggle against the papacy. Above all, the crusades, which brought the  civilization of the West face to face with that of the East, were a  powerful factor in bringing Oriental influence into Europe. The effect  they had on the European mind is shown by the great number of French and  German poems which lay their scene of action in Eastern lands, or, as  will be shown presently, introduce persons and things from India and  Persia.[7]    Of course it is as a rule impossible to tell precisely how and when the  Oriental influence came into Europe, but that it did come is absolutely  certain. The transformation of the Buddha-legend into the Christian  legend of Barlaam and Josaphat, the migration of fables and stories, and  the introduction of the game of chess furnish the clearest proofs of  this.           *       *       *       *       *    But direct information about the East was also available. A number of  merchants and missionaries penetrated even as far as China, and have  left accounts of their travels. Such an account of India and Ceylon was  given as early as the sixth century by Cosmas, surnamed Indicopleustes.  The names of Benjamin of Tudela (about 1160 A.D.) and of Marco Polo  (1271-1295) are familiar to every student of historical geography. The  Mongol rulers during the period of their dominion over China were in  active communication with the popes and allowed Western missionaries  free access to their realm. A number of these missionaries also came to  India or Persia, for instance Giovanni de Montecorvino (1289-1293),[8]  Odorico da Pordenone (1316-1318),[9] Friar Jordanus (1321-1323, and  1330)[10] and Giovanni de Marignolli (1347).[11] In the fifteenth  century Henry III of Castile sent Ruy Gonzales de Clavijo as ambassador  to Timur, and towards the end of that century several Venetian  Ambassadors, Caterino Zeno (1472), Josaphat Barbaro (1473) and Ambrosio  Contarini (1473), were at the Persian Court in order to bring about  united action on the part of Venice and Persia against the Turks.[12]  These embassies attracted considerable attention in Europe, as is shown  by numerous pamphlets concerning them, published in several European  countries.[13] In this same century Nicolo de Conti travelled in India  and the account of his wanderings has been recorded by Poggio.[14]    As we see, most of these travellers are Italians. We know of but one  German, before the year 1500, who went further than the Holy Land, and  that is Johann Schildberger of Munich, whose book of travel was printed  in 1473. Taken prisoner while fighting in Turkish service against Timur  at Angora, he remained in the East from 1395 to 1417, and got as far as  Persia. His description of that country is very meagre; India, as he  expressly states,[15] he never visited, his statements about that land  being mostly plagiarized from Mandeville.[16]    These accounts, however, while they give valuable information concerning  the physical geography, the wealth, size, and wonderful things of the  countries they describe, have little or nothing to say about the  languages or literatures. All that Conti for instance has to say on this  important subject is contained in a single sentence: \"Loquendi idiomata  sunt apud Indos plurima, atque inter se varia.\"[17]    In these accounts it was not so much truthfulness that appealed to the  public, as strangeness and fancifulness. Thus Marco Polo's narrative,  marvelous as it was, never became as popular as the spurious memoirs of  Mandeville, who in serving up his monstrosities ransacked almost every  author, classic or mediaeval, on whom he could lay his hands.[18] In fact  a class of books arose which bore the significant name of _Mirabilia  Mundi_ and purported to treat of the whole world, and especially of  India. Such are, for instance, _Les Merveilles de l'Inde_ by Jean  Vauquelin, _Fenix de las maravillas del mondo_ by Raymundus Lullius, and  similar works by Nicolaus Donis, Arnaldus de Badeto and others.[19] But  the great store-house of Oriental marvels on which the mediaeval poets  drew for material was the Alexander-romance of pseudo-Callisthenes, of  which there were a number of Latin versions, the most important being  the epitome made by Julius Valerius and the _Historia de Preliis_  written by the archpresbyter Leo in the tenth century. The character of  the Oriental lore offered in these writings is best shown by a cursory  examination of the work last mentioned.[20] There we are introduced to a  bewildering array of _mirabilia_, snakes, hippopotami, scorpions,  giant-lobsters, forest-men, bats, elephants, bearded women, dog-headed  people, griffins, white women with long hair and canine teeth,  fire-spouting birds, trees that grow and vanish in the course of a  single day, mountains of adamant, and finally sacred sun-trees and  moon-trees that possess the gift of prophecy. But beyond some vague  reference to asceticism not a trace of knowledge of Brahmanic life can  be found. While the Brahman King Didimus is well versed in Roman and  Greek mythology, he never mentions the name of any of his own gods. Of  real information concerning India there is almost nothing.           *       *       *       *       *    From what we have seen thus far we shall not expect in mediaeval  literature conscious imitation or reproduction of works from Persian or  Sanskrit literature. Whatever influence these literatures exerted in  Europe was indirect. If a subject was transmitted from East to West it  was as a rule stripped of its Oriental names and characteristics, and  even its Oriental origin was often forgotten. This is the case with the  greater part of the fables and stories that can be traced to Eastern  sources and have found their way into such works as the _Gesta  Romanorum_, or the writings of Boccaccio, Straparola and Lafontaine.  Sometimes, however, the history of the origin is still remembered, as  for instance in the famous _Buch der Beispiele_, where the preface  begins thus: \"Es ist von den alten wysen der geschlaecht der welt dis  buoch des ersten jn yndischer sprauch gedicht und darnach in die  buochstaben der Persen verwandelt,....\"[21]    Poems whose subjects are of Eastern origin are not frequent in the  German literature of the middle ages. The most striking example of such  a poem is the \"Barlaam und Josaphat\" of Rudolph von Ems (about 1225),  the story of which, as has been conclusively proved, is nothing more or  less than the legend of Buddha in Christian garb.[22] The well known  \"Herzmaere\" of the same author has likewise been shown"]]]
