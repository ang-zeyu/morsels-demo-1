It was too beautiful a night to sleep, so I put my head out to look and  to think. I saw the moon come up and hang for a while over the mountain  as if it were discouraged with the prospect, and the big white stars  flirted shamelessly with the hills. I saw a coyote come trotting along  and I felt sorry for him, having to hunt food in so barren a place, but  when presently I heard the whirr of wings I felt sorry for the sage  chickens he had disturbed. At length a cloud came up and I went to  sleep, and next morning was covered several inches with snow. It didn't  hurt us a bit, but while I was struggling with stubborn corsets and  shoes I communed with myself, after the manner of prodigals, and said:  \"How much better that I were down in Denver, even at Mrs. Coney's,  digging with a skewer into the corners seeking dirt which _might_ be  there, yea, even eating codfish, than that I should perish on this  desert--of imagination.\" So I turned the current of my imagination and  fancied that I was at home before the fireplace, and that the backlog  was about to roll down. My fancy was in such good working trim that  before I knew it I kicked the wagon wheel, and I certainly got as warm  as the most \"sot\" Scientist that ever read Mrs. Eddy could possibly  wish.    After two more such days I \"arrived.\" When I went up to the office  where I was to file, the door was open and the most taciturn old man  sat before a desk. I hesitated at the door, but he never let on. I  coughed, yet no sign but a deeper scowl. I stepped in and modestly  kicked over a chair. He whirled around like I had shot him. \"Well?\" he  interrogated. I said, \"I am powerful glad of it. I was afraid you were  sick, you looked in such pain.\" He looked at me a minute, then grinned  and said he thought I was a book-agent. Fancy me, a fat, comfortable  widow, trying to sell books!    Well, I filed and came home. If you will believe me, the Scot was glad  to see me and didn't herald the Campbells for two hours after I got  home. I'll tell you, it is mighty seldom any one's so much appreciated.    No, we have no rural delivery. It is two miles to the office, but I go  whenever I like. It is really the jolliest kind of fun to gallop down.  We are sixty miles from the railroad, but when we want anything we send  by the mail-carrier for it, only there is nothing to get.    I know this is an inexcusably long letter, but it is snowing so hard  and you know how I like to talk. I am sure Jerrine will enjoy the cards  and we will be glad to get them. Many things that are a comfort to us  out here came from dear Mrs. ----. Baby has the rabbit you gave her last  Easter a year ago. In Denver I was afraid my baby would grow up devoid  of imagination. Like all the kindergartners, she depended upon others  to amuse her. I was very sorry about it, for my castles in Spain have  been real homes to me. But there is no fear. She has a block of wood  she found in the blacksmith shop which she calls her \"dear baby.\" A  spoke out of a wagon wheel is \"little Margaret,\" and a barrel-stave is  \"bad little Johnny.\"    Well, I must quit writing before you vote me a nuisance. With lots of  love to you,      Your sincere friend,      ELINORE RUPERT.          III    A BUSY, HAPPY SUMMER           _September 11, 1909._    DEAR MRS. CONEY,--    This has been for me the busiest, happiest summer I can remember. I  have worked very hard, but it has been work that I really enjoy. Help  of any kind is very hard to get here, and Mr. Stewart had been too  confident of getting men, so that haying caught him with too few men to  put up the hay. He had no man to run the mower and he couldn't run both  the mower and the stacker, so you can fancy what a place he was in.    I don't know that I ever told you, but my parents died within a year of  each other and left six of us to shift for ourselves. Our people  offered to take one here and there among them until we should all have  a place, but we refused to be raised on the halves and so arranged to  stay at Grandmother's and keep together. Well, we had no money to hire  men to do our work, so had to learn to do it ourselves. Consequently I  learned to do many things which girls more fortunately situated don't  even know have to be done. Among the things I learned to do was the way  to run a mowing-machine. It cost me many bitter tears because I got  sunburned, and my hands were hard, rough, and stained with machine oil,  and I used to wonder how any Prince Charming could overlook all that in  any girl he came to. For all I had ever read of the Prince had to do  with his \"reverently kissing her lily-white hand,\" or doing some other  fool trick with a hand as white as a snowflake. Well, when my Prince  showed up he didn't lose much time in letting me know that \"Barkis was  willing,\" and I wrapped my hands in my old checked apron and took him  up before he could catch his breath. Then there was no more mowing, and  I almost forgot that I knew how until Mr. Stewart got into such a  panic. If he put a man to mow, it kept them all idle at the stacker,  and he just couldn't get enough men. I was afraid to tell him I could  mow for fear he would forbid me to do so. But one morning, when he was  chasing a last hope of help, I went down to the barn, took out the  horses, and went to mowing. I had enough cut before he got back to show  him I knew how, and as he came back manless he was delighted as well as  surprised. I was glad because I really like to mow, and besides that, I  am adding feathers to my cap in a surprising way. When you see me again  you will think I am wearing a feather duster, but it is only that I  have been said to have almost as much sense as a \"mon,\" and that is an  honor I never aspired to, even in my wildest dreams.    I have done most of my cooking at night, have milked seven cows every  day, and have done all the hay-cutting, so you see I have been working.  But I have found time to put up thirty pints of jelly and the same  amount of jam for myself. I used wild fruits, gooseberries, currants,  raspberries, and cherries. I have almost two gallons of the cherry  butter, and I think it is delicious. I wish I could get some of it to  you, I am sure you would like it.    We began haying July 5 and finished September 8. After working so hard  and so steadily I decided on a day off, so yesterday I saddled the  pony, took a few things I needed, and Jerrine and I fared forth. Baby  can ride behind quite well. We got away by sunup and a glorious day we  had. We followed a stream higher up into the mountains and the air was  so keen and clear at first we had on our coats. There was a tang of  sage and of pine in the air, and our horse was midside deep in  rabbit-brush, a shrub just covered with flowers that look and smell  like goldenrod. The blue distance promised many alluring adventures, so  we went along singing and simply gulping in summer. Occasionally a  bunch of sage chickens would fly up out of the sagebrush, or a jack  rabbit would leap out. Once we saw a bunch of antelope gallop over a  hill, but we were out just to be out, and game didn't tempt us. I  started, though, to have just as good a time as possible, so I had a  fish-hook in my knapsack.    Presently, about noon, we came to a little dell where the grass was as  soft and as green as a lawn. The creek kept right up against the hills  on one side and there were groves of quaking asp and cottonwoods that  made shade, and service-bushes and birches that shut off the ugly hills  on the other side. We dismounted and prepared to noon. We caught a few  grasshoppers and I cut a birch pole for a rod. The trout are so  beautiful now, their sides are so silvery, with dashes of old rose and  orange, their speckles are so black, while their backs look as if they  had been sprinkled with gold-dust. They bite so well that it doesn't  require any especial skill or tackle to catch plenty for a meal in a  few minutes.    In a little while I went back to where I had left my pony browsing,  with eight beauties. We made a fire first, then I dressed my trout  while it was burning down to a nice bed of coals. I had brought a  frying-pan and a bottle of lard, salt, and buttered bread. We gathered  a few service-berries, our trout were soon browned, and with water,  clear, and as cold as ice, we had a feast. The quaking aspens are  beginning to turn yellow, but no leaves have fallen. Their shadows  dimpled and twinkled over the grass like happy children. The sound of  the dashing, roaring water kept inviting me to cast for trout, but I  didn't want to carry them so far, so we rested until the sun was  getting low and then started for home, with the song of the locusts in  our ears warning us that the melancholy days are almost here. We would  come up over the top of a hill into the glory of a beautiful sunset  with its gorgeous colors, then down into the little valley already  purpling with mysterious twilight. So on, until, just at dark, we rode  into our corral and a mighty tired, sleepy little girl was powerfully  glad to get home.    After I had mailed my other letter I was afraid that you would think me  plumb bold about the little Bo-Peep, and was a heap sorrier than you  can think. If you only knew the hardships these poor men endure. They  go two together and sometimes it is months before they see another  soul, and rarely ever a woman. I wouldn't act so free in town, but  these men see people so seldom that they are awkward and embarrassed. I  like to put them at ease, and it is to be done only by being kind of  hail-fellow-well-met with them. So far not one has ever misunderstood  me and I have been treated with every courtesy and kindness, so I am  powerfully glad you understand. They really enjoy doing these little  things like fixing our dinner, and if my poor company can add to any  one'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16643"],[0,"Essays (#2)"],[1,"ness, still less of the rigidity which is  often noticeable in the generation succeeding next to that of the men  in their shirt-sleeves, he would have been noticed anywhere as one  evidently a scholarly thinker astray from the alcove or the study,  which were his natural habitats. His voice was very sweet, and  penetrating without any loudness or mark of effort. His enunciation  was beautifully clear, but he often hesitated as if waiting for the  right word to present itself. His manner was very quiet, his smile was  pleasant, but he did not like explosive laughter any better than  Hawthorne did. None who met him can fail to recall that serene and  kindly presence, in which there was mingled a certain spiritual  remoteness with the most benignant human welcome to all who were  privileged to enjoy his companionship.\"    Emerson died April 27, 1882, after a few days' illness from pneumonia.  Dr. Garnett in his excellent biography says: \"Seldom had 'the reaper  whose name is Death' gathered such illustrious harvest as between  December 1880 and April 1882. In the first month of this period George  Eliot passed away, in the ensuing February Carlyle followed; in April  Lord Beaconsfield died, deplored by his party, nor unregretted by his  country; in February of the following year Longfellow was carried to  the tomb; in April Rossetti was laid to rest by the sea, and the  pavement of Westminster Abbey was disturbed to receive the dust of  Darwin. And now Emerson lay down in death beside the painter of man  and the searcher of nature, the English-Oriental statesman, the poet  of the plain man and the poet of the artist, and the prophet whose  name is indissolubly linked with his own. All these men passed into  eternity laden with the spoils of Time, but of none of them could it  be said, as of Emerson, that the most shining intellectual glory and  the most potent intellectual force of a continent had departed along  with him.\"          CRITICAL OPINIONS OF EMERSON AND HIS WRITINGS.      Matthew Arnold, in an address on Emerson delivered in Boston, gave  an excellent estimate of the rank we should accord to him in the great  hierarchy of letters. Some, perhaps, will think that Arnold was  unappreciative and cold, but dispassionate readers will be inclined to  agree with his judgment of our great American.    After a review of the poetical works of Emerson the English critic  draws his conclusions as follows:    \"I do not then place Emerson among the great poets. But I go farther,  and say that I do not place him among the great writers, the great men  of letters. Who are the great men of letters? They are men like  Cicero, Plato, Bacon, Pascal, Swift, Voltaire--writers with, in the  first place, a genius and instinct for style.... Brilliant and  powerful passages in a man's writings do not prove his possession of  it. Emerson has passages of noble and pathetic eloquence; he has  passages of shrewd and felicitous wit; he has crisp epigram; he has  passages of exquisitely touched observation of nature. Yet he is not a  great writer.... Carlyle formulates perfectly the defects of his  friend's poetic and literary productions when he says: 'For me it is  too ethereal, speculative, theoretic; I will have all things condense  themselves, take shape and body, if they are to have my sympathy.' ...    \".... Not with the Miltons and Grays, not with the Platos and Spinozas,  not with the Swifts and Voltaires, not with the Montaignes and  Addisons, can we rank Emerson. No man could see this clearer than  Emerson himself. 'Alas, my friend,' he writes in reply to Carlyle, who  had exhorted him to creative work,--'Alas, my friend, I can do no such  gay thing as you say. I do not belong to the poets, but only to a low  department of literature,--the reporters; suburban men.' He deprecated  his friend's praise; praise 'generous to a fault' he calls it; praise  'generous to the shaming of me,--cold, fastidious, ebbing person that  I am.'\"    After all this unfavorable criticism Arnold begins to praise. Quoting  passages from the Essays, he adds:    \"This is tonic indeed! And let no one object that it is too general;  that more practical, positive direction is what we want.... Yes,  truly, his insight is admirable; his truth is precious. Yet the secret  of his effect is not even in these; it is in his temper. It is in the  hopeful, serene, beautiful temper wherewith these, in Emerson, are  indissolubly united; in which they work and have their being.... One  can scarcely overrate the importance of holding fast to happiness and  hope. It gives to Emerson's work an invaluable virtue. As Wordsworth's  poetry is, in my judgment, the most important done in verse, in our  language, during the present century, so Emerson's Essays are, I  think, the most important work done in prose.... But by his conviction  that in the life of the spirit is happiness, and by his hope that this  life of the spirit will come more and more to be sanely understood,  and to prevail, and to work for happiness,--by this conviction and  hope Emerson was great, and he will surely prove in the end to have  been right in them.... You cannot prize him too much, nor heed him too  diligently.\"    Herman Grimm, a German critic of great influence in his own country,  did much to obtain a hearing for Emerson's works in Germany. At first  the Germans could not understand the unusual English, the unaccustomed  turns of phrase which are so characteristic of Emerson's style.    \"Macaulay gives them no difficulty; even Carlyle is comprehended. But  in Emerson's writings the broad turnpike is suddenly changed into a  hazardous sandy foot-path. His thoughts and his style are American. He  is not writing for Berlin, but for the people of Massachusetts.... It  is an art to rise above what we have been taught.... All great men are  seen to possess this freedom. They derive their standard from their  own natures, and their observations on life are so natural and  spontaneous that it would seem as if the most illiterate person with a  scrap of common-sense would have made the same.... We become wiser  with them, and know not how the difficult appears easy and the  involved plain.    \"Emerson possesses this noble manner of communicating himself. He  inspires me with courage and confidence. He has read and seen but  conceals the labor. I meet in his works plenty of familiar facts, but  he does not employ them to figure up anew the old worn-out problems:  each stands on a new spot and serves for new combinations. From  everything he sees the direct line issuing which connects it with the  focus of life....    \".... Emerson's theory is that of the 'sovereignty of the individual.'  To discover what a young man is good for, and to equip him for the  path he is to strike out in life, regardless of any other  consideration, is the great duty to which he calls attention. He makes  men self-reliant. He reveals to the eyes of the idealist the  magnificent results of practical activity, and unfolds before the  realist the grandeur of the ideal world of thought. No man is to allow  himself, through prejudice, to make a mistake in choosing the task to  which he will devote his life. Emerson's essays are, as it were,  printed sermons--all having this same text.... The wealth and harmony  of his language overpowered and entranced me anew. But even now I  cannot say wherein the secret of his influence lies. What he has  written is like life itself--the unbroken thread ever lengthened  through the addition of the small events which make up each day's  experience.\"    Froude in his famous \"Life of Carlyle\" gives an interesting description  of Emerson's visit to the Carlyles in Scotland:    \"The Carlyles were sitting alone at dinner on a Sunday afternoon at  the end of August when a Dumfries carriage drove to the door, and  there stepped out of it a young American then unknown to fame, but  whose influence in his own country equals that of Carlyle in ours, and  whose name stands connected with his wherever the English language is  spoken. Emerson, the younger of the two, had just broken his Unitarian  fetters, and was looking out around him like a young eagle longing for  light. He had read Carlyle's articles and had discerned with the  instinct of genius that here was a voice speaking real and fiery  convictions, and no longer echoes and conventionalisms. He had come to  Europe to study its social and spiritual phenomena; and to the young  Emerson as to the old Goethe, the most important of them appeared to  be Carlyle.... The acquaintance then begun to their mutual pleasure  ripened into a deep friendship, which has remained unclouded in spite  of wide divergences of opinion throughout their working lives.\"    Carlyle wrote to his mother after Emerson had left:    \"Our third happiness was the arrival of a certain young unknown friend  named Emerson, from Boston, in the United States, who turned aside so  far from his British, French, and Italian travels to see me here! He  had an introduction from Mill and a Frenchman (Baron d'Eichthal's  nephew) whom John knew at Rome. Of course, we could do no other than  welcome him; the rather as he seemed to be one of the most lovable  creatures in himself we had ever looked on. He stayed till next day  with us, and talked and heard to his heart's content, and left us all  really sad to part with him.\"    In 1841 Carlyle wrote to John Sterling a few words apropos of the  recent publication of Emerson's essays in England:    \"I love Emerson's book, not for its detached opinions, not even for  the scheme of the general world he has framed for himself, or any  eminence of talent he has expressed that with, but simply because it  is his own book; because there is a tone of veracity, an unmistakable  air of its being _his_, and a real utterance of a human soul, not a  mere echo of such. I consider it, in that sense, highly remarkable,  rare, very rare, in these days"]]]
