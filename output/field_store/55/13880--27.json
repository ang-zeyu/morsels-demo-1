This  peg or spur fits in a small hole in the butt of the harpoon or spear  shaft and serves to keep the weapon in its place until it is launched  from the hand. The Ungava spear is heavier than that of the western  Eskimo, hence the stick and its spur are proportionately larger. It is  well to observe carefully the purport of the spur. A javelin, assegai,  or other weapon hurled from the hand is seized in the center of gravity.  The Greenland spears have the pegs for the throwing-stick sometimes at  the center of gravity, sometimes at the butt end. In all other uses of  the throwing-stick the point of support is behind the center of gravity,  and if the weapon is not fastened in its groove it cannot be hurled.  This fastening is accomplished by the backward leaning of the peg in the  Greenland example, and by the spur on the distal end of the  throwing-stick in all other cases.      CUMBERLAND GULF TYPE.    The Cumberland Gulf type is the clumsiest throwing-stick in the Museum,  and Dr. Franz Boas recognizes it as a faithful sample of those in use  throughout Baffin Land (Fig. 4).    In general style it resembles Mr. Turner's specimens from Ungava; but  every part is coarser and heavier. It is made of oak, probably obtained  from a whaling vessel. Instead of the fiddle-head at the distal end we  have a declined and thickened prolongation of the stick without  ornament. There is no distinct handle, but provision is made for the  thumb by a deep, sloping groove; for the index-finger by a perforation,  and for the other three fingers by separate grooves. These give a  splendid grip for the hunter, but the extraordinary width of the handle  is certainly a disadvantage. There are two longitudinal grooves on the  upper face; the principal one is squared to receive the rectangular  shaft of the bird spear; the other is chipped out for the tips of the  fingers, which do not reach across to the harpoon shaft, owing to the  clumsy width of the throwing-stick. In this example, the hook for the  end of the bird-spear shaft is the canine tooth of some animal driven  into the wood at the distal end of the long-shaft groove.      FURY AND HECLA STRAITS TYPE.    In Parry's Second Voyage (p. 508) is described a throwing-stick of  Igloolik, 18 inches long, grooved for the shaft of the bird-spear, and  having a spike for the hole of the shaft, and a groove for the thumb and  for the fingers. The index-finger hole is not mentioned, but more than  probably it existed, since it is nowhere else wanting between Ungava and  Cape Romanzoff in Alaska. This form, if properly described by Parry, is  between the Ungava and the Cumberland Gulf specimen, having no kinship  with the throwing-stick of Greenland. The National Museum should possess  an example of throwing-stick from the Fury and Hecla Straits.      ANDERSON RIVER TYPE.    The Anderson River throwing-stick (and we should include the Mackenzie  River district) is a very primitive affair in the National Museum, being  only a tapering flat stick of hard wood (Fig. 5). Marks 2, 3, 4, 5, and  6 are wanting. The index-finger cavity is large and eccentric and  furnishes a firm hold. The shaft-groove is a rambling shallow slit, not  over half an inch wide. There is no hook or spur of foreign material  inserted for the spear end; but simply an excavation of the hard wood  which furnishes an edge to catch a notch in the end of the dart. Only  one specimen has been collected from this area for the National Museum;  therefore it is unsafe to make it typical, but the form is so unique  that it is well to notice that the throwing-stick in Eskimoland has its  simplest form in the center and not in the extremities of its whole  area. It is as yet unsafe to speculate concerning the origin of this  implement. A rude form is as likely to be a degenerate son as to be the  relic of a barbaric ancestry. Among the theories of origin respecting  the Eskimo, that which claims for them a more southern habitat long ago  is of great force. If, following retreating ice, they first struck the  frozen ocean at the mouth of Mackenzie's River and then invented the  kyak and the throwing-stick, thence we may follow both of these in two  directions as they depart from a single source.      POINT BARROW TYPE.    Through the kindness of Mr. John Murdoch, I have examined a number from  this locality, all alike, collected in the expedition of Lieutenant Ray,  U.S.A. (Fig. 6). They are all of soft wood, and in general outline they  resemble a tall amphora, bisected, or with a slice cut out of the middle  longitudinally. There is a distinct \"razor-strop\" handle, while in those  previously described the handle is scarcely distinct from the body.  Marks 3, 4, 5, and 6 are wanting. The index-finger hole is very large  and eccentric, forming the handle of the \"amphora.\" The groove for the  harpoon or spear-shaft commences opposite the index-finger cavity as a  shallow depression, and deepens gradually to its other extremity, where  the hook for the spear-shaft is formed by an ivory peg. This form is  structurally almost the same as the Anderson River type, only it is much  better finished.      KOTZEBUE SOUND TYPE.    The Kotzebue Sound type is an elongated truncated pyramid, or obelisk,  fluted on all sides (Fig. 7). The handle is in the spiral shape so  frequent in Eskimo skin-scrapers from Norton Sound and vicinity, and  exactly fits the thumb and the last three fingers. Marks 5 and 6 are  wanting. The index cavity is a _cul de sac_, into which the forefinger  is to be hooked when the implement is in use. Especial attention is  called to this characteristic because it occurs here for the first time  and will not be seen again after we pass Cape Vancouver. From Ungava to  Point Barrow the index-finger hole is eccentric and the finger passes  quite through the implement and to the right of the harpoon or  spear-shaft. In the Kotzebue type the index finger cavity is subjacent  to the spear-shaft groove, consequently the forefinger would be wounded  or at least in the way by passing through the stick. The spear or  harpoon-shaft groove is wide and shallow and passes immediately over the  index cavity. The hook is of ivory and stands up above the wood. It  needs only to be mentioned that this type, as well as those with  eccentric forefinger perforations are used with the naked hand.    In the quarto volume of Beechey's Voyage, page 324, is mentioned a  throwing-stick from Eschscholtz Bay, with a hole for the forefinger and  a notch for the thumb, the spear being placed in the groove and embraced  by the middle finger and the thumb. This last assertion is very  important. When I first began to examine a large number of the  implements, I could not explain the cavities for the finger-tips until  this note suggested that the shaft rides outside of and not under the  fingers. To test the matter I had a throwing-stick made to fit my hand,  and found that the spear could get no start if clamped close to the  throwing-stick by all the fingers; but if allowed to rest on the back of  the fingers or a part of them, and it is held fast, by the thumb and  middle finger, it had just that small rise which gave it a start from  the propelling instrument.    In the national collection is a specimen marked Russian America,  collected by Commodore John Rodgers, resembling in many respects the  Kotzebue Sound type. The handle is of the same razor-strop shape, but on  the upper side are three deep depressions for the finger-tips. In  several of the objects already described provision is made for the tips  of the last three fingers by means of a gutter or slight indentations.  But in no other examples is there such pronounced separation of the  fingers. In very many of the Norton Sound skin-dressers, composed of a  stone blade and ivory handle, the fingers are separated in exactly the  same manner. These skin-dressers are from the area just south of  Kotzebue Sound. The back of the Rodgers specimen is ornamented in its  lower half by means of grooves. In its upper half are represented the  legs and feet of some animal carved out in a graceful manner. The  index-finger cavity is central and is seen on the upper side by a very  slight rectangular perforation, which, however, does not admit the  extrusion of any part of the index-finger. The upper surface is formed  by two inclined planes meeting in the center. Along this central ridge  is excavated the groove for the spear-shaft, deep at its lower end and  quite running out at its upper extremity. The hook for the end of the  harpoon-shaft in this specimen resembles that seen on the  throwing-sticks of the region south of Cape Vancouver. The whole  execution of this specimen is so much superior to that of any other in  the Museum and the material so different as to create the suspicion that  it was made by a white man, with steel tools (Fig 8).      EASTERN SIBERIAN TYPE.    The National Museum has no throwing-stick from this region, but  Nordenskjoeld figures one in the Voyage of Vega (p. 477, Fig. 5), which  is as simple as the one from Anderson River, excepting that the former  has a hook of ivory, while the latter has a mere excavation to receive  the cavity on the end of the weapon. Nordenskjoeld's bird-spear  accompanying the stick has a bulb or enlargement of the shaft at the  point opposite the handle of the throwing-stick, which is new to the  collection of the National Museum. Indeed, a systematic study should now  be made of the Siberian throwing-sticks to decide concerning the  commercial relationships if not the consanguinities of the people of  that region.      PORT CLARENCE AND CAPE NOME TYPE.    The specimens from this area are more or less spatulate in form, but  very irregular, with the handle varying from that of the razor-st"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17607"],[0,"Superstition In All Ages (1732) (#2)"],[1,"and the honesty to abjure religious errors.

PREFACE OF THE AUTHOR.    When we wish to examine in a cool, calm way the opinions of men, we are  very much surprised to find that in those which we consider the most  essential, nothing is more rare than to find them using common sense;  that is to say, the portion of judgment sufficient to know the most  simple truths, to reject the most striking absurdities, and to be  shocked by palpable contradictions. We have an example of this in  Theology, a science revered in all times, in all countries, by the  greatest number of mortals; an object considered the most important, the  most useful, and the most indispensable to the happiness of society. If  they would but take the trouble to sound the principles upon which this  pretended science rests itself, they would be compelled to admit that  the principles which were considered incontestable, are but hazardous  suppositions, conceived in ignorance, propagated by enthusiasm or bad  intention, adopted by timid credulity, preserved by habit, which never  reasons, and revered solely because it is not comprehended. Some, says  Montaigne, make the world believe that which they do not themselves  believe; a greater number of others make themselves believe, not  comprehending what it is to believe. In a word, whoever will consult  common sense upon religious opinions, and will carry into this  examination the attention given to objects of ordinary interest, will  easily perceive that these opinions have no solid foundation; that all  religion is but a castle in the air; that Theology is but ignorance of  natural causes reduced to a system; that it is but a long tissue of  chimeras and contradictions; that it presents to all the different  nations of the earth only romances devoid of probability, of which the  hero himself is made up of qualities impossible to reconcile, his name  having the power to excite in all hearts respect and fear, is found to  be but a vague word, which men continually utter, being able to attach  to it only such ideas or qualities as are belied by the facts, or which  evidently contradict each other. The notion of this imaginary being, or  rather the word by which we designate him, would be of no consequence  did it not cause ravages without number upon the earth. Born into the  opinion that this phantom is for them a very interesting reality, men,  instead of wisely concluding from its incomprehensibility that they are  exempt from thinking of it, on the contrary, conclude that they can not  occupy themselves enough about it, that they must meditate upon it  without ceasing, reason without end, and never lose sight of it. The  invincible ignorance in which they are kept in this respect, far from  discouraging them, does but excite their curiosity; instead of putting  them on guard against their imagination, this ignorance makes them  positive, dogmatic, imperious, and causes them to quarrel with all those  who oppose doubts to the reveries which their brains have brought forth.  What perplexity, when we attempt to solve an unsolvable problem! Anxious  meditations upon an object impossible to grasp, and which, however, is  supposed to be very important to him, can but put a man into bad humor,  and produce in his brain dangerous transports. When interest, vanity,  and ambition are joined to such a morose disposition, society  necessarily becomes troubled. This is why so many nations have often  become the theaters of extravagances caused by nonsensical visionists,  who, publishing their shallow speculations for the eternal truth, have  kindled the enthusiasm of princes and of people, and have prepared them  for opinions which they represented as essential to the glory of  divinity and to the happiness of empires. We have seen, a thousand  times, in all parts of our globe, infuriated fanatics slaughtering each  other, lighting the funeral piles, committing without scruple, as a  matter of duty, the greatest crimes. Why? To maintain or to propagate  the impertinent conjectures of enthusiasts, or to sanction the knaveries  of impostors on account of a being who exists only in their imagination,  and who is known only by the ravages, the disputes, and the follies  which he has caused upon the earth.    Originally, savage nations, ferocious, perpetually at war, adored, under  various names, some God conformed to their ideas; that is to say, cruel,  carnivorous, selfish, greedy of blood. We find in all the religions of  the earth a God of armies, a jealous God, an avenging God, an  exterminating God, a God who enjoys carnage and whose worshipers make it  a duty to serve him to his taste. Lambs, bulls, children, men, heretics,  infidels, kings, whole nations, are sacrificed to him. The zealous  servants of this barbarous God go so far as to believe that they are  obliged to offer themselves as a sacrifice to him. Everywhere we see  zealots who, after having sadly meditated upon their terrible God,  imagine that, in order to please him, they must do themselves all the  harm possible, and inflict upon themselves, in his honor, all imaginable  torments. In a word, everywhere the baneful ideas of Divinity, far from  consoling men for misfortunes incident to their existence, have filled  the heart with trouble, and given birth to follies destructive to them.  How could the human mind, filled with frightful phantoms and guided by  men interested in perpetuating its ignorance and its fear, make  progress? Man was compelled to vegetate in his primitive stupidity; he  was preserved only by invisible powers, upon whom his fate was supposed  to depend. Solely occupied with his alarms and his unintelligible  reveries, he was always at the mercy of his priests, who reserved for  themselves the right of thinking for him and of regulating his conduct.    Thus man was, and always remained, a child without experience, a slave  without courage, a loggerhead who feared to reason, and who could never  escape from the labyrinth into which his ancestors had misled him; he  felt compelled to groan under the yoke of his Gods, of whom he knew  nothing except the fabulous accounts of their ministers. These, after  having fettered him by the ties of opinion, have remained his masters or  delivered him up defenseless to the absolute power of tyrants, no less  terrible than the Gods, of whom they were the representatives upon the  earth. Oppressed by the double yoke of spiritual and temporal power, it  was impossible for the people to instruct themselves and to work for  their own welfare. Thus, religion, politics, and morals became  sanctuaries, into which the profane were not permitted to enter. Men had  no other morality than that which their legislators and their priests  claimed as descended from unknown empyrean regions. The human mind,  perplexed by these theological opinions, misunderstood itself, doubted  its own powers, mistrusted experience, feared truth, disdained its  reason, and left it to blindly follow authority. Man was a pure machine  in the hands of his tyrants and his priests, who alone had the right to  regulate his movements. Always treated as a slave, he had at all times  and in all places the vices and dispositions of a slave.    These are the true sources of the corruption of habits, to which  religion never opposes anything but ideal and ineffectual obstacles;  ignorance and servitude have a tendency to make men wicked and unhappy.  Science, reason, liberty, alone can reform them and render them more  happy; but everything conspires to blind them and to confirm them in  their blindness. The priests deceive them, tyrants corrupt them in order  to subjugate them more easily. Tyranny has been, and will always be, the  chief source of the depraved morals and habitual calamities of the  people. These, almost always fascinated by their religious notions or by  metaphysical fictions, instead of looking upon the natural and visible  causes of their miseries, attribute their vices to the imperfections of  their nature, and their misfortunes to the anger of their Gods; they  offer to Heaven vows, sacrifices, and presents, in order to put an end  to their misfortunes, which are really due only to the negligence, the  ignorance, and to the perversity of their guides, to the folly of their  institutions, to their foolish customs, to their false opinions, to  their unreasonable laws, and especially to their want of enlightenment.  Let the mind be filled early with true ideas; let man's reason be  cultivated; let justice govern him; and there will be no need of  opposing to his passions the powerless barrier of the fear of Gods. Men  will be good when they are well taught, well governed, chastised or  censured for the evil, and justly rewarded for the good which they have  done to their fellow-citizens. It is idle to pretend to cure mortals of  their vices if we do not begin by curing them of their prejudices. It is  only by showing them the truth that they can know their best interests  and the real motives which will lead them to happiness. Long enough have  the instructors of the people fixed their eyes on heaven; let them at  last bring them back to the earth. Tired of an incomprehensible  theology, of ridiculous fables, of impenetrable mysteries, of puerile  ceremonies, let the human mind occupy itself with natural things,  intelligible objects, sensible truths, and useful knowledge. Let the  vain chimeras which beset the people be dissipated, and very soon  rational opinions will fill the minds of those who were believed fated  to be"]]]
